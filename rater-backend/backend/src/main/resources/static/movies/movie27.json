Seems like a lot in 2 hours, but not only is the message of class division clear, Bong presents it in the most accessible and humorous way while being able to shock his viewer; and everything from the performance of the cast, to the script, to the cinematography and to the production is flawless and jaw dropping.Calling it a great movie is an understatement. Bong has created a masterpiece and what could possibly his best film so far. Go watch the movie as soon as possible. If you love cinema, this is one movie you have to watch. It will leave you speechless at the end."

I have one tiny issue with the film but it is more of a nitpick. The film\u2019s message is a little on the nose but I don\u2019t have a huge issue with it but it is noticeable. Other than that, this film is perfect. There is not one bad performance in the movie. Cho Yeo-jeong, Park So-dam, and Kang-Ho Song are standouts from the film. All 3 of them have some of the best acting of the year. Their work with a fantastic script that is incredibly well written and clever makes their performance so much more enjoyable. Another aspect I loved was the cinematography. The film\u2019s slow camera movements and slow tracking shots look absolutely beautiful which go along great with the fantastic production design. The film\u2019s story and themes make this film incredible. The story of this poor family slowly infiltrating a rich family only to find out that their house is not what it seems. It\u2019s so incredibly tense. You never know what is going to happen next and it\u2019s always surprising to see what eventually happens. The film has themes of class divide and class warfare throughout which are very profound. The rich family says these lines about how great their life is while the opposite is happening to the poor family. Every time this occurs, you see how the poor family reacts and makes the scene and film itself dramatically more tense. Another thing I liked about the film was the score by Jung Jaeil. His score adds so much more to the tension. I know I\u2019m using the word tension a lot but that\u2019s what this film is. A constant build up of tension scene by scene until it all culminates in the finale. For me, each passing scene left me more and more on the edge of my seat. One final aspect I want to touch on is the humor. Most of the jokes are cleverly written and while some of the jokes may not be that funny, I do appreciate how they were cleverly inserted instead of incredibly forced. Except this film to be on a bunch of Top 10 lists at the end of the year. Overall, Parasite is a fantastic film with great acting, great cinematography, and a powerful story about class divide even if its message may be a little too on the nose."

I don't know whether to consider it a comedy, drama, thriller, dark comedy, etc., as it contains so many elements of all these genres. One thing I do know is certain though, this is such an interesting and unbelievable film in virtually every way possible! Winner of the Palme d'Or (the French equivalent of an Academy Award) earlier this year at the Cannes Film Festival, this film follows a poor Korean family that attempts to insert themselves into the lives of a rich, upper-class suburban family by getting themselves hired for various jobs for the family, such as a math tudor, chauffeur, cook, etc. They seem intent on even replacing the family and claiming the house for themselves if possible, until they stumble upon something shocking and unexpected within the house. And to say too much else beyond that would ruin the amazing experience of viewing this film for the first time! Really, all I can say is this: No other film this year had me laughing so much during one moment, and then completely on the edge of my seat during another, with certain scenes even leaving me absolutely breathless and speechless! The acting, writing, and dialogue were all so brilliant and razor-sharp as well! The film is layered with so many unexpected twists and turns! I never knew where this film was going or what it'd morph or evolve into next, as each scene and moment always felt so radically different and unpredictable than the last! On top of all that, the film undeniably provides a unique subtext on class, social status, the lengths some will go to for prosperity, and how people within certain classes are often perceived. Overall, I can't even begin to heap enough praise towards this masterpiece of a film! It had just about everything to offer, combined so many favorite elements and genres of mine, and left me flabbergasted by the end to the point where I sat through the entire credits and then some in order to properly process and sit with what I'd just watched! This is far and out one of the best films of the year, maybe even the decade!"

      "text": "In \u201cParasite,\u201d Writer/Director Bong Joon Ho continues his critique of capitalist economies that, in his judgment, inevitably create economic divides resulting in class warfare.  In his earlier films \u201cOkja\u201d (2017) and \u201cSnowpiercer\u201d (2013), Bong used a platform of science fiction to soften the message.  With \u201cParasite,\u201d he employs slapstick and dark humor to leaven a story that, in lesser hands, might have become painfully didactic.Setting his story in Seoul, Bong has the benefit of dealing with class warfare and economic inequality without the complication of race.  South Korea is one of the most ethnically homogeneous countries in the world \u2013 96% of the population is Korean.Bong\u2019s pacing of his story is impeccable.  In Act One, we are introduced to the Kim family, literally and figuratively living in the lower reaches of the city, the parents unemployed and struggling, the kids getting by on street smarts.  When workers come by spraying white clouds of pesticide in their rodent-infested section of the city, the father advises to leave the windows open:  \u201cIt\u2019s free extermination.\u201d  At the other end of the economic spectrum is the Park family, wealthy beyond reason and totally reliant on others to do anything requiring physical or mental heavy lifting.  Bong underlines his premise by conveying clearly that, while they have great wealth, the Parks are not endowed with a particularly high level of intelligence, common sense or self-awareness.When a wealthy friend of the Kim son creates an opportunity for him to tutor the Park daughter, the Kims use this entry point as leverage, creating jobs for every member of the family within the Park household.  So far, the story, is light, bright and slapstick, with only a small vein of dark humor.  This tone offers opportunities for non-threatening exposition.  Remarking on the Parks\u2019 unlined faces, Mr. Kim intones: \u201cMoney is like an iron.  It smooths the creases out.\u201dIn Act Two, the story takes a darker turn, initially by exploring the consequences of the Kims\u2019 actions on one of the displaced workers.  By the end of the film, class warfare has escalated from bland observations (Mr. Park observes that those who ride on the subway have a \u201cspecial smell\u201d) to full-on emotional and physical violence.  For me, Bong\u2019s thoughtful, subtly-crafted story invoked a fair amount of thought and introspection.\u201cParasite\u201d won the top prize at this year\u2019s Cannes Film Festival and is South Korea\u2019s entry for Best International Feature Film at the Oscars.  It\u2019s one of the finest films of the year."

      "text": "You know a movie's good when you wind up having a dream about it. The last movie that affected me that way was Akira Kurosawa's Ran. The latest to affect me that way is Bong Joon Ho's Parasite. The only other movie I've seen from Bong is Snowpiercer, a film that dealt with the issues of class inequality, in Parasite he returns to this theme, but this time he plays it from a very realistic angle. Bong captures the tension of class disparity superbly, blending grittiness, humour and horror, and striking imagery that completely immerses you in the world he created. The actors all do a superb job, especially Kang Ho-Song, who best exemplifies through his performance, what it feels like to be on the less-fortunate end of the class spectrum. The writing is superb too, in particular how it portrays the struggle to move up the class ladder, using both the optimistic practicality of \"planning\" and pessimistic impracticality of \"dreaming\", in a hard-hitting way. This movie forces you to ride the wave with our main characters, all the way up, and down.The cinematography is beautiful, and the images composed superbly. The way the cinematography captures the architecture of our more-fortunate characters home is breathtaking, so is their lifestyle. No wonder our main characters plot and dream of being in that position, who wouldn't want to be?. The score stands out too. At times it gets super eerie and spacy and combined with the imagery, it helps produce the feeling that you are in a fever dream, and trust me, when the sh*t hits the fan in this, it's a fever dream and then some. I highly recommend this hard-hitting bit of cinema."

This is only the second movie of his that I have seen and it really makes me want to watch more! This movie is about a poor family who all get jobs working for a rich family as part of a scheme, and it just gets crazier from there. The performances are excellent, the story is interesting, it looks beautiful, it has comedy, it has suspense, it has horror, it has romance, it has everything! My only complaints are that the movie is a little slow in the first act and that sometimes the dialogue went by too fast for me to read the subtitles. This is good writing, and I feel like I missed some of it. I\u2019m a pretty slow reader though, so your experience may differ. And yeah, the movie is presented in its original language and subtitled. If that\u2019s an issue for you, don\u2019t see it. You won\u2019t enjoy it.

In times of cholera and uncertainty, Bong Joon-Ho\u2019s latest and buzziest masterpiece comes like a head-turning accomplishment, a surgically accurate class fable, a truly gripping multi-genre piece of entertainment, and a reinvigorating storytelling-rich decade-new awake. Ever since its Palme d\u2019Or win, \u201cParasite\u201d has been ground-breaking new history, not only by becoming the very first non-English language, non-epic-length period drama nabbing the Best Picture award at the 2020 Oscars ceremony, but by giving new life into movie-going experience in an aging era of convoluted streaming-service battles and rowdy franchise-building tentpoles.In a way, \u201cParasite\u201d feels like the \u201cInception\u201d of this new century. Back in 2010, Christopher Nolan\u2019s towering 160-million Russian doll odyssey opened several doors industry-wise, putting the absolute, always-coveted formula into one single movie: crushing box office incomes, cerebral, wholly original storytelling, and, above else, priceless craftsmanship power. However, Nolan did not treasure any social-resounding message as sharply as Bong Joon-Ho did overseas. \u201cParasite\u201d, on the other hand, is a small-budgeted, South-Korean thinking piece that, even while managing different procedures\u2014 it turned out to be more profitable than Nolan\u2019s pic \u2014comes to the very same conclusion: great filmmaking is the key. Social-headed slices of art would never be about big budgets and small films like \u201cGet Out\u201d and \u201cThe Invisible Man\u201d are proving that studios, either big or small, may still conquer audiences with entertaining, on-point storytelling.  Script-wise, \u201cParasite\u201d is an utter knockout. At first glance, the most outstanding, praised features the film exposes now and again are its turns and twists, the comings and goings of a story where everything mutes into something unexpected. These \u201cthink-again\u201d premium plot devices are the main pulling force for mainstream audiences, even though they are not the most powerful assets Joon-Ho has to offer. The truly one-of-a-kind centerpieces are: proceedings and composition. Take for instance the 5-minute towering montage at the end of the first act, where black humor, cadence and rhythm are the beating heart of the sequence. It builds and places anticipation at the highest level by using endless narrative tricks to convey the emotions and reactions the film intends to spring up, blurring the line between good and bad, between wealth and the poverty, between sarcasm and irony. Every one of the characters succeeds at becoming storytelling backbones because of the amazing ensemble cast, which\u2014 by the way \u2014became the very first foreign Ensemble Winner at SAG Awards, making, one more time, movie history. Park So-dam, Lee Sun-kyun, Choi Woo-shik, Cho Yeo-jeong, and Song Kang-ho deliver award-worthy performances, endowing to the story tangible, three-dimensional characters that, in incompetent hands, would come out as hollow caricatures.    Bong Joon-Ho\u2019s pictures are described as many things at once: black comedies, social commentaries, genre-crossing post-apocalyptic adventures. Owning every inch of them, \u201cParasite\u201d spices the mix up with deeper, timely metaphors\u2014 make no mistake, peaches and basements are not going to be the same; \u2014 however, the film owes it to two crucial aspects: visual language and edition. Camera movements, blocking and visual composition are masterfully managed by the director and his crew. It could have been a silent film, and still it would speak volumes. Cinematographer Hong Kyung-pyo executes his vision with perverse precision and voyeuristic delight, grabbing class divide by the throat. What could have ended up as a mere style exercise between the shady lighting from the semi-basement and the luxury LED lighting of the main mansion, it is now the perfect visual cocktail:  sophistication and softness, luxury and poverty, ups and downs, dark and light, hungry beasts in empty spaces. \u201cGisaengchung\u201d by Bong Joon-Ho is the crowning achievement of the decade. Many critics have healed it as \u201cthe picture of the year\u201d and, even if it is tout \u00e0 fait true, \u201cParasite\u201d transcends the boundaries of society-headed, industry-transforming films; say Jordan Peele\u2019s ambitious allegory \u201cUs\u201d reimagined through the lens and voices of Shakespeare, Hitchcock and Kim Ki-young, and still you are nowhere near to it. Many talented, socially-aware filmmakers and their equally committed crews have paved the way through the years; now Bong Joon-Ho, in total command of his craft, has made it: \u201cParasite\u201d is a groundbreaking work of art."

With its impecable directing and great performances, it delivers a darkly funny, often awkwardly haunting tale that touches on themes of class devide while never forgetting to be first and foremost a very enjoyable thriller."

But this time it has been different. When I saw the huge amount of Academy Awards \"Parasite\" was recieving, I felt the immediate need to see it. And I won't ever regret it.\"Parasite\", directed by Bong Joon-ho, is a perfect mix of black comedy, thriller, drama and social critic. It just has everything. The title is also magnificent. It makes you think that you'll see South Korea battling against \"coronavirus\" but no; you'll watch a capturing movie where the word \"parasite\" will recieve another deep meaning: the way poor people are seen by the rich class and how someone opposed to you is a kind of virus inside your house; something that doesn't fit in, that does not belong here nor isn't welcomed.This film is, by far, a must-see for cinema lovers since it has all factors that make a movie perfect. My congartulations to the actors and director who made me cry of joy and of sadness and have made me see how this world is a beautiful mess."

      "text": "Parasite, Bong Joon-Ho's recent Satire of the social class division in South Korea is nothing short of incredible. The film is more or less divided into two major sections:the first half of the film follows a Family living in the poor areas of Seoul (im assuming). After the son Ki-Woo (Choi Woo-shik)is given the opportunity to work as an English tutor in an extremely rich household, he begins to realize that despite having a great income, the adults of the family are not exactly the brightest of induviduals, and so slowly Ki-Woo and his family devise a plan to all come into the employment of their new wealthy acquaintances. Although the film may give a lighthearted impression, once the movie transitions into the second half it becomes extraordinarily twisted, slightly resembling the ending of Robert Eggers's 'The Lighthouse'.After contemplating the events that took place witin the film, It seems obvious to me that Like JB Priestley's 'An Inspector Calls', Bong Joon-ho intends for this movie to display a clear contast between the lives of the rich and the struggles of the poor within this obviously unjust society. Of course it doesn't just rub your face with morals, and there is a very substantial and entertaining plot, but this is one of the main focuses of the movie.As for the other, i'd say that would be the excellent dynamic between characters which is further developed by the brilliant performances from every cast member, particularly Park So-dam who in my opinion was robbed of a Best supporting actress nomination. Other notable features include some top of the line cinematography and a outstanding writing, but other than that I feel there isn't much to talk about.Parasite is an absolute masterpiece, and like so many other films that have come out recently I absolutely recommend it.Fun fact: Elon Musk officially stated that Parasite was his favorite movie of 2019, and whie that's all well and good, the film practically exists to ridicule people like him."
