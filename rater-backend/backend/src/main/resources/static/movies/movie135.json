He also has an underage girlfriend, Diane, along for the ride. After cleaning up and moving from Edinburgh to London, Mark finds he can't escape the life he left behind when Begbie shows up at his front door on the lam, and a scheming Sick Boy follows.",

      "text": "A darkly funny and fast-paced style of filming has the underbelly of a drug story involving a group of friends as they combat drug addiction, sexual partners and tragic circumstances of drug-induced decisions. We follow Renton (Ewan McGregor), a young Scottish lad who is on and off heroin with his group of friends, he narrates throughout the film as he struggles to find meaning other than drugs, we are introduced to his friends, equally lacking ambition, including Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), Tommy (Kevin McKidd) and Begbie (Robert Carlyle), Renton seems to come with the attitude that he is surrounded by idiots and simpletons, not necessarily the case, but he  certainly surrounded by unique individuals indeed, they all have regular lives yet are drawn together by having a group 'hit' on regular occasions, here the film chronicles the type of routine and obstacles that an addict may face, whether its finding a job, trying to get clean or taking on selling the product they put into their bodies, it deals with friendship, love and also what is holding such emotional attachments together, is it real or is it drugs that keep friends being friends in the film? We are offered different insights into the question, while we also have a witty and humorous film from start to finish, McGregor plays an unsure and immature young person who goes with the flow, McKidd is driven to a life of drugs after a relationship breakdown while Begbie is maniacal and hot-headed individual a long history and a short temper, with Carlyle delivering a very broad Scottish accent to heighten is highly unpredictable character.\rThe real arc of 'Trainspotting' is someone who isn't getting into the world of drug dabbling, but someone who is in it and is trying to get out of it, this is particularly intriguing for the fact that he is a young man who seems to hold some sort of intelligence but can't kick his habit. The various highlights of the film are easily the performances along with the edgy and in-depth directing of Danny Boyle, easily one of his finest films and more so one of the best British films to appear, it explores and invites controversy at every turn but manages to make the characters relatable and often thoughtful about their actions, giving the viewer more reason to be involved. Danny Boyle knows how to make each character equally as important as the last, Trainspotting does this in funny, tragic, emotional and inventive ways."

It is visually spectacular to look at,and all of the performances are very well done, especially the performance of Scottish actor Ewen McGregor. He plays a heroin addict who tries getting off the stuff, but is eventually addicted once again. the rest of the film is just a series of events, from the horribly disturbing and sad, to the very funny and entertaining. A must see."

It's broken up into vignettes, which give it a brisk, almost manic narrative style. The cast is also fantastic, with Ewan Macgregor and Robert Carlyle being my favorites. The soundtrack is predictably excellent. Not recommended for the squeamish, but it's worth a look regardless. Negatives include the generally absent plot and lack of focus, but those are only minor annoyances."

      "text": "Overall, a very good film. It is a disturbing and sad tale, but a very well told one with great acting. Now, in terms of films on addiction, this one is much lighter than a film such as Requiem for a Dream and easier to get through for sure (though I do prefer Requiem for a Dream to this one). This \"lightness\" is thanks to good dark comedy elements and the hopefulness you feel for a better future at different times during the film. However, that does not mean this one is not dark as there are many scenes that are extremely haunting and really make you feel one with the characters as they went through these situations. Ewan McGregor is great in this film, though really the entire cast is phenomenal as everybody pulls their weight equally. Danny Boyle's direction is frenetic and fabolous. In addition, the script is awesome. Every line is dripping with quality. Ultimately, Trainspotting is a great and almost sympathetic and hopeful look at addiction and what causes people to spiral out of control. Really good film."

      "text": "A masterclass in character study, Trainspotting depicts the lives of heroin addicts as they struggle to distract themselves until they can get their next 'hit' with sex, mayhem, and other substances. All the characters come alive with superbly crafted dialogues and performances from the entire cast, and coupled with a frantically-paced style of direction from Danny Boyle that combines apt pop music inserts with innovative dream sequences, the viewer is presented with a piercing look inside the mind of a junkie.There were some sentiments surrounding the movie about how it glamorises drug use, but if one were to look just a little deeper it's easy to see that's not the case at all. The film pulls no punches when it comes to depicting tragic events and sickening actions from various characters due to their drug use. For that I believe this is actually the perfect anti-drug film: beneath all the humour and catchy songs, what the viewer gets is an honest and convincing depiction of what drugs do to someone, nothing more and nothing less.Overall, an unforgettable dark comedy that expertly balances the \u2018dark\u2019 and the \u2018comedy\u2019 that will have you reeling from laughter to disgust from one scene to the next.

      "text": "With the extraordinarily talented Danny Boyle at the helm, unflinchingly honest social commentary, a great cast and a fantastically funny script by regular Boyle collaborator John Hodge, Trainspotting, adapted from Irvine Welsh's iconic Scottish novel is a true masterpiece of British filmmaking. Following the turbulent and troubled lives of a group of young Scottish heroin addicts, the film takes a sympathetic view of the problem of drug addiction - rather than chastising them for the situation they find themselves in, it is sympathetic to the addicts' struggle and the vicious circle that traps them and slowly destroys their lives. It's among the most poignant and dramatically effective films discussing drug addiction, and Boyle is extremely adept at getting under the skin of his characters and showing what really makes them tick. The characters are an entertaining group of misfits, of particular note is central protagonist and narrator Renton (Ewan McGregor), a young man with aspirations of stability, and of happiness in his life, but who is utterly unable to survive without \"one more hit\", the violent and psychotic Begbie (Robert Carlyle), who refuses to take heroin but makes up for not doing drugs by \"doing people\" instead, and the childlike Spud (Ewan Bremner), the innocent fool of the group, and the most vulnerable to peer pressure. The cast make the very most of John Hodge's script, which channels the spirit of Irvine Welsh in a glorious explosion of heavily Scottish-accented sweary magnificence. As with many of Boyle's films, Trainspotting is a balancing act of light and shade. You'll have tears of mirth rolling down your cheeks one moment, when Renton is forced to make an emergency visit to \"the worst toilet in Scotland\", and you'll be devastated at the utterly tragic loss experienced by the characters a few scenes later. The film really does take you on an emotional rollercoaster - its a journey of highs and lows, and you can really feel for everything, both good and bad, that the characters go through. The film's nightmarish, appropriately trippy visuals (particularly in Renton's \"cold turkey\" montage), a memorable rock and dance-tinged soundtrack and Boyle's undeniable ability to maintaining the story's momentum and manic energy seals Trainspotting's position as a striking, emotional and affecting viewing experience. It's far more than a film about drug addiction - Trainspotting is about life, death and finding your place in the world. It's also, quite unexpectedly, one of the all-time great feelgood movies, and if you don't take anything else from the film, then take its unabashedly positive moral to heart, and \"choose life\"."

      "text": "Trainspotting is a film about five young miscreants and their drug-induced, illegal, and overall frowned-upon shenanigans in Edinburgh, Scotland. The main character of the film is a good-hearted guy named Mark Renton, who wants to clean his life up and become a good person, However, this task is incredibly difficult due to the unchangeable nature of so-called mates. Sick Boy seems to just to terrible things just to get a thrill out of it, Spud does them because he's unintelligent and cannot emerge from his addiction, and Begbie does it because he's a violent psychopath wrecking anything that gets in his way. The movie doesn't explain too much about each character, but their inhumane actions mostly define them so they never feel underdeveloped. The plot also supplies a lot with a little, because it's essentially just a guy's  life. Even though the movie is very good, it's certainly not for everyone. This film is the modern-day version of \"A Clockwork Orange\", as their are multiple \"gross-out\" moments that are meant to make you cringe. There's sex (underage and homosexual), nudity, teenage angst, ultra-violence, drug use, toilet plunging, and the death of a baby. Trainspotting not only has excellent cinematography, but an equally great if not better soundtrack. The songs used in the film are often times giving off polar opposite vibes then what you're viewing, which is a technique I'm personally a big fan of. Pacing is never an issue in this film. There are no points where I was bored are waiting for something to happen next. The writing is very strong, and the ridiculous Scottish accents enhance the delivery of each f-word that much more enjoyable. Acting is also very strong. Ewan McGregor leads a cast of very talented Scottish actors, each with great range and commitment. Overall this movie is a cautionary tale showcasing horrors of doing drugs and having an addiction, and probably would be received better  if the content within the film was more universally enjoyable."

This is a completely beloved film, and I absolutely hate everything about it.\rOnce again, I have to admit, I only got about 60% of the way through this awful film. Let me recite everything I remember.\rEwan McGregor swims into a disgusting toilet full of turds to retrieve his heroine. It's supposed to be a metaphor, but all it really is is a stomachache. I suppose it may just be a metaphor for what McGregor did when he got the lead role in this film. Next, McGregor's character Renton and one of his friends are at a park. They shoot a dog with a BB gun, so it will get angry and violently attack its owner. Why? Ha! F**k you! We just like to hurt people! Boyle isn't even trying now. Then, some guy in a bar gets kicked in the groin and gives those dumb over-acted reactions actors give when their characters get hit in the groin, which only happens in the first place because the writers are lazy as **** Anyway, I couldn't take it anymore, so I stopped watching. I've heard other reviews of the film. Apparently the heroine addicts have a friggin' baby, and it dies of thirst after being neglected. Woohoo! Movie night!\rListen, you can make a film that has horrifying imagery if your goal is to warn the audience. George Orwell understood that. Tarantino understands that. Danny Boyle? Didn't seem to understand it here. You can do it, but not when you give your film this weird comedic wrapping that Trainspotting has. It acts like a comedy, which to me, is insulting and cruel."

It is the late eighties and early nineties and the economic down turn is at its worst.\rThe movie starts with Renton listing all the things he is missing, the movie ends with it too. What has happened in between the beginning and the end?Just daily life of the poverty stricken criminal lower strata of English urban society. But with one significant exception: Renton and his mates have struck gold: sixteen thousand pounds worth of it. But it is the amount of money that is interesting. On its own it is a reasonable sum, but split four ways the money wouldn't last them long.

This inventive pic version of U.K. author Irvine Welsh\u2019s cult 1993 novel, set among a group of self-destructive no-hopers and junkies in Edinburgh\u2019s underbelly, shares only the visual invention and buccaneering spirit of the same team\u2019s explosive debut, the black comedy \u201cShallow Grave.\u201d Result looks set to delight a narrow band of young auds turned on by the book and its nonjudgmental tone but alienate more general viewers with its complex mix of in-your-face realism, cinematic fantasy and four-letter dialogue, which sets new standards in screen profanity.\r Welsh\u2019s book \u2014 more a collection of p.o.v. episodes, written in different styles, than a conventional novel \u2014 has already been translated to London\u2019s off-West End stage. For the film, scripter John Hodge has centered the action on Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor), an on-off junkie who acts as a funnel to the surreal world of his four \u201cfriends.\u201d Like Alex in Kubrick\u2019s 1971 pic (to which there\u2019s a brief homage), Mark regales the audience with his anti-middle-class values and idiosyncratic philosophy of life, finally achieving a liberation that\u2019s more a temporary escape than a real shift in perception.\r A five-minute pre-title sequence introduces the setting (an Edinburgh suburb) and main characters, each of whom gradually swims into focus as the pic unfolds. There\u2019s Begbie (Robert Carlyle), a knife-carrying, \u201csensory-addicted,\u201d foul-mouthed psycho who \u201conly does people,\u201d not drugs; Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), a philandering self-obsessive; way-out Spud (Ewen Bremner), who dates Gail (Shirley Henderson); and Tommy, who dates Lizzy (Pauline Lynch) and claims he never takes drugs or tells lies.\r Tale then plunges straight into its irreal world with graphic descriptions of a heroin-induced high. Mark decides to kick the habit again, but not before embarking on a megahit that starts with opium suppositories and leads him (in the pic\u2019s most breathtaking mix of black humor and Daliesque fantasy) to dive headfirst into a pan in \u201cthe worse toilet in Scotland.\u201d\r His sex drive returning as his system clears, Mark hooks up at a club with smart-mouthed looker Diane (Kelly Macdonald), and \u2014 in an elaborately comic sequence intercutting Tommy and Spud\u2019s separate bedroom adventures \u2014 goes home with her. Next morning, he finds she\u2019s still a schoolgirl living with her parents.\r Tone is set by the rough, self-deprecating Scottish humor delivered in heavy accents that will tax North American auds \u2014 and even many English \u2014 to the limit. (One sequence, in a nightclub, is even jokingly subtitled.) Rarely has a British film so relied on the flavor of dialect for its overall dramatic effect, blending humor and tragedy, realism and fantasy.\r After another giant hit and a series of withdrawal fantasies in a room whose wallpaper is covered with trains, Mark moves to London and starts over with a semi-respectable job. One day, however, Begbie turns up, and Mark is eventually lured back north and into a drug deal that could net the group some serious money.\r Film\u2019s most striking accomplishment \u2014 which will appall moralists as much as it will delight others \u2014 is the way it takes a bunch of goal-less losers and a subject (guilt-free drug taking) that\u2019s ripe for downbeat grunge and turns the material into a sustained piece of cinema that\u2019s often wildly funny and, at a character level, extremely involving. Propelled by an almost constant soundtrack of songs, several featuring Iggy Pop, pic manages to sustain interest in a storyline that, until the final reels, largely goes round in circles as its main character kicks and returns to his habit.\r Unstated is the fact that the story is set in the Thatcherite \u201980s, which heightens Mark\u2019s rejection (and final apparent embrace) of consumerist values. Other than that, however, pic is just as relevant to the \u201990s.\r Director Danny Boyle, again working with producer Andrew Macdonald, writer Hodge, production designer Kave Quinn, editor Masahiro Hirakubo and lenser Brian Tufano, has come up with a visual style that exactly matches the wild swings in the story. As in \u201cShallow Grave,\u201d every setup complements the characters or drama and feels thought-through rather than merely used for gratuitous effect. Once again, Boyle squeezes the most visual bang out of a low-bucks budget of $ 2 .6 million.\r Performances are terrific at all levels, with McGregor a likable Mark, Bremner (who essayed the Mark role onstage) almost endearing as the loony Spud, and 17-year-old newcomer Macdonald a confident discovery as the sassy Diane. Dominating the film, however, is Carlyle, who, after notable work in \u201cPriest\u201d and \u201cGo Now,\u201d turns in a genuinely terrifying perf as the psychopathic Begbie, a walking time bomb who\u2019s halfway to hell."

Une bande de potes sans doute mais surtout une bande de crevards que le r\u00e9alisateur Danny Boyle, connu pour son ironie, nous d\u00e9peint avec force caricature et une f\u00e9rocit\u00e9 des plus caustiques.L'humour anglo-\u00e9cossais (ou britannique \u00e0 tout le moins) ne vole parfois pas bien haut et les situations tombent comme autant de chevaux (de cheveux pardon) dans la soupe d'un sc\u00e9nario assez branlant ma foi. M\u00eame s'il se passe ici et l\u00e0 certaines choses affreuses (ou \u00e9minemment dramatiques, du reste) m\u00eame si l'addiction est souvent trait\u00e9e par dessus la jambe, l'ironie de cette com\u00e9die grin\u00e7ante reprend toujours le dessus, pour le meilleur et pour le pire... \u00e0 la limite de l'absurdit\u00e9.En somme, un film de tar\u00e9 avec des tar\u00e9s mais dont le rythme ne faiblit jamais, m\u00e9chamment dr\u00f4le ou dr\u00f4lement m\u00e9chant mais heureusement toujours \u00e0 mille lieues d'une saloperie de tarantinerie. Les acteurs servent admirablement cette bizarrerie cynique sans foi ni loi : McGregor bien s\u00fbr mais aussi et surtout le stup\u00e9fiant Robert Carlyle, hargneux, teigneux et dangereux : hilarant \u00e0 souhait !Je ne l'avais pas revu depuis un bout de temps mais force est de constater que le film n'a pas perdu de son impact initial... et quelle bande son pour accompagner tout \u00e7a !"

      "text": "a definite visit..TrainspottingFew such drug related features gets it right and the primary reason it does, is the resonance towards the practicality among these pragmatic characters whose trajectories are unpredictable and justifying; the perfect balance that every writer dreams for. The writing is strong, effective and confident in its own malleable bubble that isn't afraid to visit new places and tell its own story. And even though the feature is dark and inedible to encounter, the humour installed in here doesn't seem forced and instead ironically completely palpable to its tone. The chemistry and the conversations between the lead characters communicates fairly to the audience as it offers lots of mutual thing to connect easily. A smart adaptation by John Hodge; the screenwriter, keeps it short and to-the-point with perfect editing. And as far as execution is concerned, Danny Boyle has got it covered and has done some of his best work in here as a director. Ewan McGregor is convincing in his portrayal of a drug addict and is pretty much left to carry on the whole feature on his shoulder where he is supported decently by the cast. Trainspotting is a definite visit, as it redefines the genre and offers enough thought-provoking homework to the audience along with keeping them entertained throughout the course of it."

      "text": "A badly appreciated and misunderstood movie that uses wry humor to convey a serious and dramatic message against drug use.I confess that I began to see this movie with little expectation about it. I knew it was one of the most acclaimed movies in cinema for many. Even so, I was not enthusiastic about it. And I ended up enjoying the style of the movie.The script follows the marginal trajectory of a group of young people from the Scottish suburbs. Everyone, in one way or another, is linked to heavy drug use and crime. And everyone, one way or another, pays for it. Thought of as a light film, it is more serious than it looks and addresses strong themes in an innovative and intelligent way. Contrary to popular belief, the film is not a comedy at all, nor is it a favorable view of the drug world. Quite the opposite. The movie is much more serious, there are truly tragic moments (such as the dying baby, almost symbolizing all innocents, suffering and indirect victims of the drug, by the hands of those who get involved and addicted to the drug) and a clear anti-drug message. drugs by showing how each young person suffers the consequences: years in prison, death ... Although drug use is clearly shown to be recreational in the movie, and the characters take pleasure in the drugs, the movie also shows how their lives (and those of people who love them) are ruined by addiction.The characters are complex and intense. Each has its own characteristics and psychological profile. The dialogues are excellent and the use of a Scottish accent carried by Scottish actors gives it some authenticity and originality. Ewan McGregor got his springboard here for well-deserved stardom, and he might not have been the renowned actor he is today if he had not participated in this movie. With a controversial and unpleasant character, he is the star of the movie. Along with him, a number of actors who each had their own opportunity and talent to shine: Ewen Bremner, Robert Carlyle, Kevin McKidd, Kelly Macdonald, Jonny Lee Miller ... there's room for each to stand out at the right times, and I believe that their careers have taken full advantage of this.Technically, the movie is flawless. Without ever taking the focus off the storytelling or exaggerating putting style ahead of content, the film features groundbreaking features in photography, film angles and soundtrack, considered by many to be one of the most interesting in contemporary cinema with tracks. by Iggy Pop, Lou Reed, New Order and other rock names."

Also, the movie has got an outstanding cast of actors/actresses they all do an amazing job for what they're given, especially Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor) he has to be the best character throughout this movie. Overall, it's an excellent movie which I should have watched earlier than later but it's honestly worth the watch, I really enjoyed it."

Attraverso dei personaggi indimenticabili e delle situazioni tal volta grottesche e comiche, il film non racconta soltanto della tossicodipendenza di un gruppo di ragazzi ma di uno spaccato di societ\u00e0 inglese nel pieno del suo mutamento stilistico e culturale. Colonna sonora magistrale."
