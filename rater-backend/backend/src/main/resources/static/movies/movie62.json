It's amazing for a huge movie to be so self-aware of itself, as well as, the movie genres that they're overtly borrowing from. The minor characters or those not even in Avengers: Infinity War, step up and help set up huge sequences that are highly entertaining and actually answer questions. Avengers: Endgame acknowledges every aspect of the characters emotions in their previous MCU film's and succeeds in the most Meta way possible.Ant-Man is a major reason for this. It's no spoiler to say that he's in the film as he produces some of the biggest laughs from the trailer of him ringing the bell at the Avenger's front gate. It's Paul Rudd's wry jokes, quick timing and fish out of water facial expressions that really assist things.The pacing of Avengers: Endgame is amazing and not for the reasons you might think. It's brilliantly paced, but it throws the entire formula and how MCU films are done on their head. Battle, loss, battle, loss, humor and then victory, take those ingredients, shake well and you've got a loose description of some average superhero films.If Avengers: Infinity War left you feeling betrayed and bummed out, I feel you. Avengers: Endgame more than makes up for any ill feelings that it caused. I see why they played it the way they did, and doing so any other way would've cheapened the film, watered down the MCU and made it all disposable. It is also worth noting that the film balance lots of humor with the drama, all the while putting it in a nice bow with stones.What we're left with is a 10 year opus that spans more arcs than Lord of the Rings and encapsulates it all in a perfect manner. Granted, they will still make many MCU films, this is not their swan song. However, there is a victory lap feeling about Avengers: Endgame. It respects the fans, adds to the dramatic elements, answers questions that fans have wondered about and plants a couple new seeds to grow on."

Well, if we use this mindset, the whole movie is \"forced\" because so many things had to happen at the right place and right time: Tony Stark meeting his father, Steve Rogers getting back with his love of life. Also, if Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hawkeye, Star Lord, Black Panther and Dr. Strange are fighting together in one scene, I don't think people would say it's \"forced\" although they are all males. Last but not least, this whole movie is a fan service. Let's just celebrate the diversity of the superhero lineup. Everyone of them is the favorite for some fans. You don't need to bash others to love one. Thank you!"

Throwbacks and characters appear from more than last decade of movies. The acting and comedy is on point with every joke hitting perfectly and every actor showing their passion for the role. The movies set pieces are perfect with sets from past movies. The action, humor and overall story telling shows the passion that not only the Russo brothers had for this film but everyone involved. The story concludes the 22 films perfectly while also leaving character arcs open for future MCU movies. This movie deserves the praise and excites me for future MCU movies in the future.

I don't not like this film, and I couldn't hate it if I tried too. Its a movie packed with fan service and a decent send-off I suppose. \"But I will be retiring with my favourite characters, and not returning for more.

More than the plot holes or the ridiculousness of the jokes what I disliked the most was how impertinent they were with the product placement, a commercial for Fortnite, a commercial for Axe and the most brazen of all the Audi one, its clear they gave more priority to other things that make it a coherent film with cinematographic arguments."
