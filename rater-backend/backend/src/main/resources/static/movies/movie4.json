It's the Godfather Part III that's the bad one, not II! The acting was about 2/3 as good as the original. Al Pacino took the leading role and made it shine, though not nearly like Marlon Brando did. The supporting cast was very good, although it was Robert DeNiro who swept the movie, winning him his first Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor."

The plot is so interesting and totally sucks you in, you can't even tell it's over 3 hours.  Robert De Niro's, Vito Corleone, I almost (not quite though) is as good as Marlon Brando's.  Which I think was an amazing achievement.  It is possibly the greatest movie ever made."

Robert De Niro however was a great choice for the young Don Vito. Not quite as good as the original for the reasons mentioned above but still an outstanding movie."

The cinematography is brilliant. The characters are highly textured. The dual story lines being parallel throughout the film is an excellent device in which to tell the stories of Vito and Michael Corleone. Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola have created a masterpiece."

      "text": "The Godfather is one of my favourite ever films, and i'm glad to say that The Godfather Part II manages to match the first chapter in the story of Corleone family. The best thing about this movie, for me, was the flashback sequences to Vito's early years, how he ended up living in America, how he got started in the mafia, how he made his first (I presume it was his first) kill, how he set up his most important element: Family. The absence of Marlon Brando is evident here, but its made up for as we have Robert De Niro playing the young Don Corleone. There is a vast difference between Michael and his deceased father, Vito. Vito immensly loved his family and it was evident that family was the most important thing to him. To Michael, that is not true. Note how he smacks Kay across the face, how he refuses to let her see his children, how he orders the execution of his brother Fredo. The final scene, where we got a flashback to the family at the table for Vitos surprise party, is quite a well executed scene, and it was interesting to see the familys reaction to Michael joining the Marines and that it was Sonny who introduced the despicable wife beater Carlo to Connie. Honestly, this film was pretty brilliant, but I, myself prefer the first film. This is definately one of the best sequels though"

      "text": "The Godfather part II is hailed as the greatest sequel of all time..... But it isn't. It is a remarkable movie, but has some big problems... Problems which you can't simply overlook, and which manifest themselves more and more with repeated viewings.\r The film struggles to maintain the narrative and characters as defined in the first film. It's understandable that Michael has become embittered and has difficulty balancing the life as the 'Don', and that of a loving husband and father. But that element only exists because the movie insists on keeping Kay away from the actual truth about who Michael really is. When, towards the end of the movie, she discovers his duplicity and hard-edge, she is actually shocked..... Even though throughout the movie she clearly doesn't believe Michael's assurances about what he does for a 'living'. It's not enough to wonder where their family's wealth comes from, and it just makes no sense.\r The other major problem is from a Direction point of view. De Palma won an Oscar for this movie (he didn't win for The Godfather, which is a far, far better film!) but the narrative structure is pretty awful. Jumping between Vito (in 1920's New York) to Michael (in the late 50's/early 60's) isn't handled well. The popping back and forth, and the parallels in the two storylines is well crafted, but there are massive pockets in the movie where the pace just falls off. There is a need in the 'Vito' era to introduce the characters who appeared in The Godfather, just as there is a need in the 'Michael' era to tie it into contemporary 'big' events..... (in this case the build up to, and subsequent take-over, of Cuba by the Communist rebels).\r The bottom line is that the film falls well short of the brilliance of the original. Even so it's still a masterpiece compared to the truly awful Part III!!!\rYou don't need to see part II, if you've seen part I.... In fact I'd recommend reading the book, it's far more compelling!"

The acting was very good and the rise of Vito Corleone was very interesting to watch. However, the plot regarding Michael is fairly dull and overall far too little happens to spread the film over three hours. I am a fan of longer films in general, however I think the same story could have been told in 2 hours. The important parts of the plot are given far too little attention, while the film dedicates far longer periods of time to dull scenes. Worst of all was the ending, which was a non-event. Although it is far from the worst film I have seen, it is definitely overrated."

It's about Michael becoming mentally unstable during a period of time, and the Mafia doing things. However, that doesn't stop this film from having some filler padding like the original.This film is 3 and a half hours long! Why?! The whole Cuba segment could be taken out, some scenes here and there can be removed, I'm just baffled by these decisions. I understand wanting to show your entire vision, but it doesn't work as well when it's so long!The prequel part is great, but even that could be trimmed a bit. The sequel part drags on in my opinion.So I will say it's better than the original based on plot and characters (less characters to deal with and the characters have more development in this film). However, the first film was at least under 3 hours and had more of a unique vision (it felt more artistic)."

I can't believe people liked the Godfather Part: II, the first one is terrific is easily in my top 5 best movies ever made.

The 200 minutes are a lot too long and get boring, even\ras I anticipatorily watched the movie on two consecutive evenings, and\rneither of the cross-cut story parts was as interesting and thrilling\ras the one the original movie had to offer. That isn't to say that The\rGodfather Part II skimps on entertaining and rememberable scenes; in\rfact, the movie's best moments may even be more rememberable than The\rGodfather's. However, a lot of the scenes in between are just too long\rand not really necessary  what would have been needed a lot more were\radditional explanation scenes as the panoply of characters grows even\rbigger through the story being set in two different times and the\rdialogues give more focus to being pointed and quotable instead of\rmaking what happens fully clear. This is indubitably important, don't\rlet me be misunderstood, but the huge plot that Mario Puzo has devised\rfor The Godfather is simply too complex and convoluted to be easily\rgrasped without having read the source material. Nevertheless, The\rGodfather Part II is a cinematic masterpiece that is sovereign and\rseminal on so many different layers, such as the beautifully\rpicturesque cinematography, the smooth editing, the meticulously\rconceived set design, the innovative and unforgettable score by Nino\rRota, and the tremendous acting cast that is reflected in the five\rOscar nominations for acting (a tied record). Thus, The Godfather Part\rII is an undeniably excellent motion picture that merely suffers from\rthe director's attempt to put too much in just one movie."

      "text": "The second chapter in the life of Vito Corleone best known as The Godfather.\rAt just over 200 minutes I think it's safe to say that The Godfather Part Two isn't a movie for a rainy Friday afternoon, it's definitely less gripping than the first but that doesn't mean to say that it isn't interesting. Actually it's the opposite. Francis Ford Coppola keeps everything slick and cool but still intelligent, some scenes are more compelling than others. Particularly the tense confrontation between two brothers. With no Marlon Brando to give the film at least one guaranteed brilliant performance, you might worry that the actors are not strong enough to portray the legendary characters well. Luckily Pacino and De Niro are both excellent and provide the movie two Oscar worthy performances, which don't even rival Brando from the first film but are still very good.\rOverall I don't think that The Godfather Part Two was as enjoyable or as gut wrenching as the first, but due to many excellent performances and another chilling yet satisfying ending I still find it to be a timeless piece of cinema."

If one looks back at that wonderful decade of cinema, he or she would see 'Colossal' films like Taxi Driver, Apocalypse Now, Annie Hall, Means Streets, Jaws, Chinatown, The Godfather (Its Predecessor) and many more. But, I think, the film which captures 6 Academy Awards (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Original Score, Best Art-Direction and Best Actor in a Supporting Role) surpasses them all, and that film is The Godfather Part II.\r To begin with it's acting would be a pleasure to me. \"Sun rising to shine the world\" That would be the expression to depict it's masterful acting. Well supported by it's supporting players and that include Robert Duvall (extremely impressive), John Cazale, Lee Strasberg and Michael V. Gazzo. Al Pacino plays the cold Michael Corleone, who's delivery entertained me with some kind of realism. Just rightfully perfect, I could conclude that he's transformed or easily put, Al gives a perfect performance which deserved an Oscar for best performance of the year. Just somewhere in that corner of brilliance, one could see a composed acting of Robert Deniro as young Vito Corleone. It is like pure cloud gathering all around him, truly an unforgettable contribution. In summary, it could be commented that this piece is a well acted motion picture.\r The element which grasped my attention is Coppola's method of slow or methodical filmmaking which captures the beauty of this cinema. Beautifully shot from start to finish, it is a breathtaking sight of grandeur.\r This film is a cleverly written piece too. Completed with inspiring dialogue, attractive epic storytelling and it could be easily 'snatched'that it is masterful.\r Many would disagree with me because I'm going to, or will always name this picture as 'The Greatest Film Ever Made'. The Godfather is an offer you can't refuse but The Godfather Part II is an offer you MUST NOT refuse.\r Facebook (http://facebook.com/alex.desmall) Twitter (@Alex_DeSmall) (http://www.rottentomatoes.com/member/AlexDesmall)"

Es mi favorita de la trilog\u00eda de The Godfather, interesante y a la vez grandilocuente de como la historia que se divide en dos, una es la vida de cuando Vito aun no era el patriarca de los Corleone y por otra la trama donde ocurre los hechos del presente es decir en los 50, un Michael mas fri\u00f3 y calculador que en la primera parte, traiciones y  conspiraciones en contra su vida, la presi\u00f3n del senado y del fbi es lo que debe enfrentar en esta segunda parte, incluso si la traici\u00f3n es... mejor vean la pel\u00edcula. Agrego algo mas aparte de su impecable guion, es su banda sonora con el tema The Immigrant que se convierte en el broche que lo caracteriza."

      "text": "It has less character development than its predecessor, other than Vito Corleone, beautifully acted by Robert De Niro, whose learning of a new language truly deserves an Oscar. Al Pacino has a more sufficient role, and more dynamic, as the crime boss struggling with his crime life and family life, whose every choice is both hard and difficult to make. The rest of the ensemble makes all the violence sophisticated and interesting, mostly due to the complexity of it. And lets not forget John Cazale, although his career was short, he was an amazing actor, who actually gave me sympathy rather than scorn and a desire to see him killed. A formidable sequel, though it doesn't surpass the original."

      "text": "Yes, it may be the second movie in the Godfather trilogy, but to call The Godfather Part II a sequel is an insult to the movie, to Francis Ford Coppola, Mario Puzo, and Marlon Brando. Think of it as a \"continuation\" of the first. Although it has a 200 minute runtime, the well-made story, multi-layered characters, and Oscar-winning performances make the film breeze by. Modern directors can learn from films like this; instead of changing the shot every 5 seconds to a new angle, sometimes it is much better to just leave the camera in one spot and let the actors act. While there are more prologues and footnotes and flashbacks and flash-forwards, the movie still maintains a consistent pace and tone, the mark of a truly great picture."
