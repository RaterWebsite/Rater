Great voice acting, and truly one of the finest animations ever - there were several scenes id consider to be classed...(read more) as Art - incredible detail, beautiful landscapes etc. Im a complete newbie to animated movies that are neither Disney nor the incredible South Park movie, so forgive my lack of love for the plot/style, but id certainly recommend others to watch this."

Sheer visual beauty (lush greens of open, gusty fields and vast mountains that surpass imagination) meets an epic soundtrack the brings tears to one's eyes (a melody played throughout the movie which will stick in your psyche for years as you endlessly hum the adventurous tune to yourself and an ending piano number that, after hearing the song I previously described, might just make you burst into tears, as it casts a feeling of overwhelming spirituality that truly remains with you for a long time) In the end, the movie is about love, hatred, death, friendship, rivalry, happiness, anger, glee, sorrow, and being a human being. However, overall, it's about being alive. I never thought an animated film, let alone an anime, could be so purely great. If this isn't Oscar material, I have no clue in hell nor space what is. -Scott L."

Each frame of this film could be sold as a painting, it's just that beautiful.  Miyazaki's message of tolerance, self-control, and finding harmony with our surroundings is equally beautiful  the amazing thing about Princess Mononoke's narrative is that there is no concrete antagonist; you could find something relatable and lovable about every character drawn to the screen.  The performances delivered by the voice actors  for the Japanese and English versions- are both top notch.\r This is a film that will survive the test of time due to its visual and thematic majesty, and each of these beautifully realized properties work together to make an experience that is easy to get lost in again and again.  Everyone should give this film a watch, it offers so much more to an audience than just escapism; it serves to delight as much as it does teach."

This is probably - no, this IS - one of the best films ever made in the history of cinema, animated or live-action, along with his other masterpiece, Spirited Away. Princess Mononoke is so lush, and engaging, and it just captures you and doesn't let you go. It's a wondrous tale of MAN vs. EARTH, told spectacularly. This film hardly deserves a much less rating than Spirited Away. In fact, this film is better! It's only about 10 minutes longer than Spirited Away, so the critics can all go shove it. This deserves at least a 97 on the Metacritic score. All this movie's fans know that it is perfect, and all the critics giving it less than a - sayyyy - 95, are wrong."

An absolutely wonderful film that gives you goosebumps whenever you watch it a second time. It may even some viewers cry. This is not a kids movie, and Princess Mononoke shows that animation can tell stories that are impossible to tell through live action film. In case anybody is interested, this is also the movie (among others) that inspired James Cameron's AVATAR, especially the main story.\r In fact, AVATAR is basically a remake of this. Personally, this is the superior movie and I will remember it longer than that $237 million budgeted movie."

The story keeps going at a decent pace, but never feels forced.  The characters almost all experience some sort of development over the course of the film.  Also, the animation surpasses even Studio Ghibli's awesome standards.  The scenery is beautiful, and the near-apocalyptic climax is one of the most 'epic' scenes I have ever seen in any film.  Unless you truly hate all of anime, Studio Ghibli, nature, wolves and film, this will take your breath away.  I fail to see how it could be improved.  Do not let the length put you off."

      "text": "Maybe I was spoiled by the hype around the movie, but I failed to enjoy it and I still think it's not one of Miyazaki's best works. The best thing about the film is the fantastic music by Joe Hisaishi - 10 out of 10 for the score. The animation is beautiful as well, but not outstanding when compared to other works. The violence depicted (cutting of arms and the like) does not seem to serve any purpose but means that it's not suitable for children, which is sad, because they might enjoy it more. The story and the characters are bland. The storytelling is careless at best. Many plot lines are dropped and never readopted. One example of this is the hero's love interest who gives him a pendant as he is forced to leave. She is never mentioned again. Character's motives aren't explored and seldom a character reflects on his deeds. I often read that it's great that the film does not try to answer the question of which characters are good or evil, but this aggravates the problem. It's also the explanation why many of the character's decision seem so indiscriminate. The film's pacing doesn't help here, as it is so slow to leave much time for thinking about all the gaps in the story. In conclusion: A beautiful picture with promising topic and setting which is ruined by sub-par story-telling and characters."

The conflict was one of the best I've ever seen: not black and white, but both sides had colliding interests and refused to settle without violence. It's refreshing to see an anime with two amazing female characters oppose each other like this. Other animes have a different approach towards women. The \"main character\" doesn't matter much, which is also nice to see, because it's not the one heroic dude who saves the day. They did not fall for any clich\u00e9s here. From the beginning, where the MC walks into a battle with no music and an ordinary setting, to the end, where he does not end up with the pretty girl he flirted with. My only complaint is that the ending is kind of gross and confusing."

This transcends the anime genre. Except for the unusual concepts and cultures, it hardly seems foreign at all. Not that I am saying it is like anything Disney puts out. This story actually has depth, morality, tragedy, things which American animators consitantly flunk with. And as one critic said, it avoids the failings of most nature v. man tales-- that is, there is no black and white in this story, and there is no good and evil. I found only one character that I was capable of completely disliking That brings me to the voice acting. So often when films are dubbed, especially anime, the product becomes painful to listen to. But, thankfully, Miramax went all out. It's not that they put out the money to hire big stars, it's that they took the time to find actors who could understand their respective characters, and voice them appropriately. Disney comparisons are unavoidable, but only because Disney owns the American animation market. If Japan can send us more films like this, Disney may be in trouble."

Here is a bold movie with no villains, only flawed people who often do as many vile things as good. For once we have a film with character development, but one that also recognizes something more important than character development: seeing people as more than one dimensional right now, before they change. The magic of the film's world is as foreign to the American mind as its language, and is thoroughly rewarding to experience. There is blood, there is suffering, and even death in this movie, yet I would share it with my children. Like Walt Disney, Hayao Miyazaki does not shelter audiences from horror. He is smart enough to frame it, to educate and to evoke. The animation is gorgeous, and the soundtrack is not only thoroughly moving, but sounds authentic to the fantasy world. This is a long animated feature that earns ever half hour of its time in your DVD player."
