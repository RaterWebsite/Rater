Its a movie with highly intelligent people acting in purely emotional ways and everything just feels right. Major kudos to the director for pulling this off. Go see it immediately."

      "text": "\"Wild Tales\" is a multi-storied vehicle written and directed by Damian Szifron. One of the nominees for Best Foreign Film, and deservedly so, the film consists of 6 independent stories threaded together by the theme of revenge and retribution. From the tale of an angry lover whose mate has been unfaithful to the story of  a citizen frustrated by government corruption and  four other stories in between, these are tales woven together by a masterful story teller in the person of Senor Szifron. Superbly acted, photographed, written and directed, this film stands out as one of the most enjoyable theatrical experiences this viewer has had the pleasure of being part of in a long long time. It is no easy feat to be able to tie so many individual tales in such a way that the viewer never feels he or she is watching separate films but, instead, one large overview of the human condition and how we each cope with the circumstances that befall us. I give the film a 10 4 s and urge all who can to make it a must-see on their movie list.."

I didn\u2019t like all the \u201ctales\u201d equally, but they all held my interest and made me laugh, regardless of the cruelty inflicted in some of them as people went wildly out of control. The subjects satirized were contemporary and apparently are common to everyone all over the world \u2013 and these situations were not as trivial and juvenile as in many American comedies, which seem to be mainly about hangovers and acting stupidly. In this film, people made fools of themselves for good reason, even if, of course, their reactions were just a bit exaggerated. The comic acting was great."

Henry's ironic twist endings and a touch of Almodovar - seamlessly collide - with themes of revenge , road rage and romance. The opening and closing are super - the middle sags- especially the \"falling down\" segment. Never ever wanting to hear or even mention last year's oscar winning song - again - Let It Go kept running through my head during this it'a mad mad mad mad world romp."

      "text": "I intentionally went into this movie knowing next-to-nothing about it--I had seen one trailer without English subtitles, and that was in.  I was completely floored by the originality of the movie, both its format and its stories themselves.  It's arranged into a series of short stories centred around a small number of characters, and they're all these gorgeous little morality plays.  The stories tend to start with a perfectly normal scene and set of events--small talk between two strangers on a plane, or a man buying a birthday cake--and some kind of twist happens to take it into the unexpected, to make the tale wild, as the title suggests., as some normal situation gets completely out of hand.  Some stories have several twists to keep you guessing.  There are so many amazing moments of tension and surprise, sometimes funny and sometimes just so shocking that you have to laugh.  A wonderful, hilarious, and incredibly fun and original movie."

      "text": "This collection of six short stories is generally very entertaining but stops short of being truly great due to a couple of the longer instalments (number 4 and 5) over indulging their content. The first 2 stories are really short. The first set on a plane is frighteningly topical, unintentionally echoing events surrounding the recent tragedy in the French Alps. All the tales are about revenge of some sort or another and whilst the film is not often laugh out loud funny there is definitely a rich vein of black humour coursing through its veins. The best of the episodes involves two drivers who get caught up in violence and death following a road rage encounter. This story is very humorous and yet contains a lot of tension. It is undoubtedly the highlight. The last tale concerns a bride and groom who come to blows at their own wedding reception. This episode is also very successful at combining drama with black comedy and despite the story\u2019s arc, which could have come over as really contrived, the episode works marvellously. There is a great use of music throughout and were it not for the over indulgent \u2018Falling Down\u2019 sequence and the least entertaining \u2018Hit and Run\u2019 episode, these original tales would be worth an 8 of anyone\u2019s ratings."

After that though it kept up a brisk pace, and each story was completely different, ending with one that went on a tad too long. It reminded me of a much more gritty version of \"Kind Hearts and Coronets,\" with it's droll look at revenge."

The characters are interesting and the situations are inventive. Each one of them is creative enough to have been developed into a full-length movie, but the abbreviated length, robust pace and imaginative direction keep make one immensely entertaining. My favorite was the conflict between the Audi driver and the \"redneck\" (wickedly dark with a delightful ending)."

      "text": "This movie is fantabulous! It's chaotic and consistently funny. The anthology consists of 6 wild tales of vengeance that are thematically similar but have different narratives. All the tales serve a purpose to the overall theme of the film and they never overstay their welcome. I was hooked from the audacious opening scene of people boarding a plane and noticing that something has gone terribly wrong; if you've seen the film you will know what I'm talking about. My favorite tale has to be the road rage bit because it escalates so quickly and it was edge of your seat entertainment. My second favorite is the last tale that takes place at a wedding; it starts off cheerful then takes a left turn and becomes the most memorable wedding. This style of film making should be encouraged because in modern cinema people won't appreciate a movie because it takes too long to build up or most viewers will not have the patience to sit through a thought provoking, slow paced film. This anthology is the answer. Avid film watchers will adore this movie while the casual movie goer will be pleasantly surprised. It's not perfect but it's a wildly entertaining movie."

      "text": "This anthology of six tales of unbridled revenge delivers huge laughs while providing ample food for thought about injustice and inequality. Five of the six tales are raucously funny, while the sixth is far more serious in tone, creating something of a disconnect with its companion pieces, despite its thematic link to the others. This picture is definitely not for the squeamish or overly sensitive. But those who appreciate the sensations that come from getting screwed and getting even and who understand that karma really is a **** will no doubt find this offering a cinematic gem."
