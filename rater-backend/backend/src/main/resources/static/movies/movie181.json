The movie evoked a wide range of emotions from me, part of me wanted to be like him and part of me thought he was crazy. His interaction with Hal Holbrook was especially touching."

Philosophical ideas and views are filled throughout. Why are people so cold to each other? Human adventure is through travel and meeting new people not simply standing still living in society. You see how cold the world can be. But at the same time you see how good people can be without living in the \"American Dream\" with a house and job. The main character has parents that were not happy even though they were very wealthy. This impacted his life heavily and help cause his adventure. With an outstanding lead performance by Emile Hirsch along with an amazing supporting cast. Beautiful direction by Sean Penn and the enviroment is breathtaking while it takes an older style of film. The film will leave you inspired and heartfilled while part of you may feel some depression. If you don't enjoy the film maybe you should watch it again because you probably missed it."

We've got cities, roads, all sorts of modern conveniences. If the guy wanted to go \"find himself\" why not go to Siberia? Less people there than in Alaska.

      "text": "This film is painful to watch and, once seen, hard to forget. Both of the perspectives visible in the user reviews--McCandless as fool AND McCandless as visionary--inform Penn's directorial choices, from the retrospective structure of the film to its dense, emotionally complex episodes, each a gem of casting and ensemble acting. Emile Hirsch so inhabits McCandless that it's almost spooky, and, though the entire cast is strong, Holbrook and Keener give performances of exceptional sweetness and dignity. \"Into the Wild\" is, on one level, about a young man who starves to death amid abundance, and so is the story of an idiot. At the same time, it is the story of a man beginning to see the psychic and social costs of abundance and to yearn for a time when enough was enough, a true idealist who walks his talk. His tragic flaw is not his longing for vanished frontiers but his attempt to recreate them in his own mind, believing individual ignorance a fair approximation of their mysteries. Those who have lived in Alaska (or any extreme environment) may ridicule or condemn him, but McCandless grew up in Virginia, where nature is more pastoral theme park than \"red in tooth and claw.\" Moreover, he is exactly the age at which many of us indulge in foolish, life-threatening behavior, as the cost of auto insurance for 20-somethings attests. What's sad is the waste: though his folly is more principled than the average youth's bender or car crash or fall from a Daytona Beach balcony, he doesn't get the second chance that most of us enjoy, the chance to learn, say, the difference between independence and isolation.  Or--and this is for the users who profess simple amusement at the film--the difference between ignorance accepted as a cognitive stage and ignorance celebrated as a cognitive goal."

It depicts the real-life events of Christoper McCandless, who disposed of his cash, assets and personal belongings and spent two years hiking around the American Southwest before heading to Alaska in search of a great adventure. This journey of self-discovery is both moving and inspiring on so many levels. Such an endeavour is often of no interest to anyone but the individual themself; however, this is a story that had to be told. In this day and age of motion pictures that overkill with CGI, have mundane plots, and no real heart, this film was a welcome breath of fresh air.\r Director and adapter, Sean Penn, did a great job of transforming Jon Krakauer's words and depicting them onscreen. Yes, that's right, Sean Penn. I would have never thought I'd see him creating a screenplay so moving and heart-wrenching. This work is so far removed from anything I've personally seen him do in the past, but he did an exceptional job. He really focuses hard on the main character, Christoper McCandless, and the people he touches and inspires along his journey.\r The movie can be a little slow-paced at times  that's really the only negative aspect I took away from it  but there's always something around the corner that lifts your spirits.\r Anyway, I truly believe this is a film everyone should see at least once in their lifetime. I implore you to give it a shot."

It is not an awful film, but it never goes beyond 2nd gear. Ultimately I would I have preferred it if it was filmed like a documentary, which would have made greater impact. As a result I wanted it to end, so I wouldn\u2019t recommend it.\r Full Review\rThe first thing you notice about the film is that is positive, is that the photography and setting as very interesting, and well filmed. Having said that once you begin to appreciate the plot, you realise this isn\u2019t surprise, given the fact that the story is basically a journey across America, so great landmarks, like the Hoover Dam, are not too surprising after the first 30 minutes of the films.\r Surprisingly at points there are decent pieces of acting, in particularly the ending, and sign of suffering of Christopher (main character). Likewise Chris\u2019 parents do predict a decent level of emotion, without being seen as over-acting. However, for me, the best piece of acting was performed by Kristen Stewart. This is not because Kristen is by any means a decent actress, or depicts any sense of believable emotions, but it is simply because she is so bad playing the emotional under-age teenage girl, who wants sex. Such appealing acting by Kristen Stewart for me was one of the only bits of the film I can remember, simply because of how bad her performance is. (I watched the film literally an hour ago from writing this review). As a result for me the acting was substantial, but you know it is bad when the highlight of a film is Kristen Stewart.\r For me the best bit of the film is the ending. I won\u2019t spoil it, but basically it is unexpected, and one that is very well depicted, displaying the innocence of Christopher as a character, just wanting to live life free from the restraints of conventionality.\r However for me this is by no means a good film. The main problem for me was the story. It depicts the story of Christopher, who wants to live life free of society, and ends up in his dream land of Alaska, with flash backs depicting the journey Christopher takes. For me it was such a boring story simply because the fact that you see him make it too Alaska which therefore makes the flashbacks for me pointless, because you know any situation Christopher ends up in, he will be fine. As a result for me the flashbacks, feel more like padding than anything else. In particularly his journey to Mexico, when he wants to go to Alaska seems like a waste of time. While they try and make it more interesting and possibly spiritual by having Christopher justify his life through quotations from books, it ultimately becomes pointless.  As a result I wanted this 2 and a half hour film to end. The point here is that you could reduce the film time till about 1 hour and it wouldn\u2019t make any difference.\rThe second thing you will notice about the characters within the film is that the dialogue is too simplistic. This can be seen by how the characters that Christopher encounters, seem to have really restrictive dialogue meaning no matter how good their performances are, their depictions feel limited at best. Such limited dialogue is made worse by how Christopher seems like someone you admire, but not too likeable, yet nearly every character he meets seem to view him as some kind of god like figure, with one character wanting to adopt him, even though he only knew him for a very limited period of time. The combination of forgettable and unconvincing dialogue, in combination with a dull story that was badly portrayed, for me killed any attempt the film tried to make to make you care about the characters etc.\r Henceforth while I can see the appeal of the film, I certainly don\u2019t think it is worth all the praise it gets. It is not that the film is awful, but the high levels of potential with the film\u2019s story, in combination with the film\u2019s constant mediocrity, make this film ultimately forgettable and a film with almost no charm. Whereas bad films can be interestingly bad, this film, for me, is just boring. As a result I wouldn\u2019t recommend it to anyone."

The lead character is entirely undeserving of the sympathy, respect and philosophical status he is granted. The Alaskan climax aims to serve as an indication of the freedom he has achieved but in actuality just demonstrates his lack of respect for the wild. Meanwhile the justification for this pilgrimage remains as the void between himself and his parents, a problem he has run away from, a problem his sister has equally endured and yet he, not she, is portrayed as the hero. Accompanied by uninspiring and tedious cinematography and a narrative so forcefully littered with imagery that it constitutes nothing more that a painfully transparent attempt to promote the poetic nature of the lead character, this has to be the worst film I've seen this year."

The film is based on the true story of Christopher McCandless, a young man in search of true freedom. A recent college graduate, inspired by naturalist literature, McCandless decided to travel to Alaska and live off the land. The film follows his journey, from college graduation and is an amazing story. Emile Hirsch gives an unbelievable performance as McCandless but was snubbed by the Academy. I suspect it was for the same reason I didn't like the film, it is unbelievably slow. The story and cast are amazing, but everything is so sedentary and precise, that you can barely sit through the thing! Some three hour plus films, don't feel anywhere near that long, that's how you know they're great. On the other hand, Into The Wild easily feels much longer than three hours and unfortunately doesn't do the story justice."

It's a 2 hour and 20 minute glorification and romanticization of a guy who wasn't playing with a full deck, mentally speaking, who (perhaps somewhat inadvertently) committed suicide in the wild. He died ONLY because he didn't bother to take basic provisions like a map. Sean Penn admitted on Charlie Rose that if he simply had a map, he easily could have walked out of the area where he died instead of dying. But he was too crazy to take a map or basic survival provisions, or learn basic survival training, and thus wasted his life for no reason. His death was completely senseless, stupid and unnecessary. He was not a hero. He was not an inspiration. Therefore this movie has no reason to exist, because glorifying and romanticizing a guy who committed suicide is bad for society and mankind as a species. If you really are desperate to see a glorification of suicide then it's much cheaper to watch the old clip of Dr. Jack Kevorkian from the news show \"60 Minutes\" instead of buying a ticket to \"Into the Wild\"."

When park rangers (not people out searching for wild flowers) found it, it started after being jumped and ran for years. Chris traveled the lower Colorado River, not the rapids, in a canoe, not a kayak. The couple he later met in the Grand Canyon were German, not Dutch (or Danish; I forget what the movie said), and I doubt they were such giggling twits. He got lost in a maze of irrigation ditches and would never have reached the ocean had not Mexican hunting guides carried him and his canoe in their truck. He abandoned the canoe; it did not blow away. He was never beaten up by a railroad guard. When the manager at McDonald's asked him to wear socks, he wore socks. \"Ron Franz\" (pseudonym) did not hit the bottle after his family was killed; he mentored young Asian people and sent two through medical school.
