      "text": "Rocky took a well-worn story and redefined it by delving deep into the characters. Rocky's character arc is so familiar that everyone, even who don't watch many movies, knows every single detail about it. But the movie adds a simple twist, yet a very effective one, in the character's motivations.But it didn't stop here, as the movie keeps raising the stakes by making an advantage of all the developments that have been given to all the characters.The movie could have easily used the ups and downs of Rocky to evoke our feelings. Instead, the movie succeeded to be very moving by taking advantage of the very new twist that has been added to Balboa's motivations. The result is an underdog heroic character that is by no means clich\u00e9d. And Stallone shines in this movie and gave his best performance in his career. There are some moments when Rocky's confidence has been shaken a little bit and the hero starts to tell the message of the story and these moments somewhat worked, and they could have never worked without Sylvester Stallone's superb acting.I said that Rocky takes advantage of the developments of all its characters. Yes, all its characters!The character of Adrian, for instance, has some realistic and genuine details that make the romance between her and Rocky works very well, although the relationship proceeds so fast. Talia Shire performance made Adrian even more realistic,unique and very compelling character.Paulie is another great character that made the movie even more poignant as it gave some depth for Rocky too.What I didn't like so much is Apollo Creed. In contrast to the rest of the characters, he is nothing but the stereotypical undefeated Champion. Also, all decisions he made exposed the movie's clich\u00e9d story. With that being said, his scenes are masterfully directed and he has a very catchy style.  The final fight scene is maybe the most realistic fight scene has been shot at that time. And those who think it's not, please watch a boxing match and you'll find that boxing punches make sounds different from the comic book punches sounds that are still used in movies today.(9/10)"

The pacing is on point, the writing and characters and how they develop and learn from each other, just the fact that the movie really takes time to make you care for them. The performances of course are amazing and the wit and humor of the characters adds a special charm and lets not forget the fun boxing matches, that when you finally see them are very rewarding and engaging. The punch sound effects are pretty bad and Apollo Creed was a pretty stereotypical opponent however. The motivations of these characters and how they interact is really what made this film special."

Burt Young makes an appearance and so does Carl Weathers but Rocky even though the original lacks what Rocky II had because it was more enjoyable and fun.. Overall Rocky is a great film but the sequel is better and compared to Rocky II I think Rocky comes off as a lazier, worn out film compared to Rocky II but still a good film but as I said, nowhere near as good as Rocky II."

It was at the same time interesting in terms of the fact that you should train a lot and then you will get the result, and also really liked the final fight. But at the same time in the movie there were a lot of strange and stupid dialogs in which Rocky looked dumb. Perhaps this was planned."

While training with feisty former bantamweight contender Mickey Goldmill (Burgess Meredith), Rocky tentatively begins a relationship with Adrian (Talia Shire), the wallflower sister of his meat-packer pal Paulie (Burt Young). This story of a down-on-his-luck boxer is thoroughly predictable, but Sylvester Stallone's script and stunning performance in the title role brush aside complaints. I'll give Rocky an A+. (10/10)"

Rocky is a smart movie; which came off as a surprise to me, the whole movie is a build up to the much awaited fight giving the perfect value and gravitas to the event that it deserved but fails on living up to the expectation for the choreography is way too lose. John seems like an amateur when it comes to execute physical sequences but does a decent job for the rest of it maybe because he probably didn't have to do much since the writing is good enough to sail on its own and Sylvester is amazing on both the roles with a good enough supporting cast. Rocky is the slow ride that is comfortable and in an appropriate tone to its characters and plot giving enough space for the actors and the audience to chew it in."

      "text": "It is the quintessential underdog movie and started a legacy. Even people that have never seen the movie know who Rocky is. Every day many people still run up the \u201cRocky Stairs\u201d at the Museum of Art in Philadelphia and raise their arms like Rocky did in the movie. It is the charm of this underdog story with relatable characters and great pictures. For the story: Heavyweight champion Apollo Creed played by Carl Weathers can not fight for the title because his challenger injured his hand. Because it is too late to get a new professional challenger they decided to give an amateur the once in lifetime chance to fight for the championship. Because of Rocky's nickname \u201cThe Italian Stallion\u201d he is picked by Apollo Creed without even caring. It is Sylvester Stallone's best role as he plays the relatable and sympathetic everyman that has a hard life and struggles. There is the heartwarming lovestory between him and Adrianna Pennino played by Talia Shire. There is the struggle with his trainer Mickey Goldmill played by Burgess Meredith that knows Rocky's potential but also says that he wasted it. Finally it is Rocky's iron hard training as he will do everything to use his chance and trains like never before that wins many over. The final fight is as dramatic as intense as Apollo Creed expected an easy opponent and thought he would win before he even get sweaty. He gets someone who is filled to the brim with willpower and determination. The ending is pure bittersweet awesome. All things mentioned above create an unforgettable experience. The Rocky series is still strong and entered pop culture history long ago. It is the blueprint for underdog stories that always touch something inside of us. Overall this is an all time classic and rightfully so. A must see even if you don't like boxing. Bonus knowledge: There is a real live fight that inspired this movie. Muhammad Ali fought against Chuck Wepner whose nickname was \u201cThe Bayonne Bleeder\u201d in 1975. Everyone expected a fast knockout but Chuck gave the performance of his live and even knocked down Ali. The fight got even to round 15 when Ali won. Sylvester Stallone saw this fight and was impressed by this man. The rest is history as he wrote the script to Rocky."

      "text": "Yes this is a classic film, perhaps even a cult classic and yes there are undeniably some cliches present but I found myself rooting for Rocky and I liked seeing his relationship with the introverted Adrian develop. Of course there's the famous scenes of him pounding the streets in the very early morning, practicing day after day in the build up to the match which happens at the end of the film. I could see how this could be viewed as a 'living the American dream' type watch, or perhaps moreso an 'underdog' tale. Its quite a solid watch. Given im not a particular fan of sports, especially boxing, I wasn't expecting a great deal of this but I reckon I enjoyed it more than I perhaps imagined I might because the majority of the film isn't set in the ring, as it were and instead it concentrated on Rocky's life outside the ring, his clearly low-ish standing and it shows how he did what he could to try and raise himself above that.It is a bit cheesy but for the most part, its a reasonably solid watch and I respect that. Yes, I'd recommend this to others."
