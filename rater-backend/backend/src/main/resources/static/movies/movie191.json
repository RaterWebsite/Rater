I loved it for being both a dark, Gothic thriller and a wickedly funny love story. It was sexy and twisted and beautiful. The costume design and cinematography and music and sets all blended to create a wonderful piece of art. Fantastic movie."

You don't spend the entire film trying to outguess it but instead are so enraptured by it that it can take you by surprise.It's also a provocation, one that rides the line between exploitation and art quite daringly. You can justify good chunks of what happens in here, but maybe not all of it (or the extent of it). But taken as a cathartic release from the tyranny of a patriarchal society (and also the Japanese occupation of Korea, which is a subtext I won't pretend to completely understand) it is fitting and has its own brazen clarity. Look on my works, ye Mighty and despair...for you don't get to touch."

      "text": "Park Chan-wook is one of the most versatile directors around. Sure, Park seems fixated on tales of vengeance but never does the worn theme feel like a detractor in his films. Oldboy and Snowpiercer add intricate layers which transform the initial quest for revenge into other issues entirely. The Handmaiden is a movie that keeps the best traits of the South Korean director. Sure revenge underlines the narrative and yet the film is not entirely about revenge. Likewise, the Handmaiden is an erotic thriller and isn\u2019t an erotic thriller. A lesser director would hone in on the pornographic but the film never undercuts one of the meta-messages found within the film. Without spoiling Handmaiden, a Clockwork Orange is a film with a similar meta-commentary directed at the audience. Instead, the erotic scenes give the intended effect without going full throttle. The result is a lesbian love story which accentuates emotion over physicality. Male directors have a tendency to get a little excited with lesbian love stories and turn an otherwise amazing movie into pornography. Blue is the Warmest Color is a recent example of a film which could have utilized a little restraint required of its subject matter. The central \u201clove triangle\u201d in the Handmaiden is given an air of realism due to the level of restraint. Most characters are never who they appear to be throughout the film. In fact, the three chapter structure of the film allows for the rare successful attempt at having more than one plot twist. Film veterans are likely the only group of people who can put the puzzle pieces together early on. The twists never come across as cheap gimmicks thanks to the cinematography. The gorgeous mise en scene is spellbinding with the amount of variation found in limited locations. In spite of the lavish designs, the camera never hides character ticks one can begin to hone in on. The Handmaiden contains a lot of the admirable traits one might in a Stanley Kubrick film (the Clockwork Orange reference is not entirely pulled out of a hat). However, the middle-aged Korean director is able to separate and maybe transcend Kubrick in his use of overt dark humor. Manchester by the Sea is another serious film which also successfully utilizes humor to create a humanistic story. Kubrick usually utilizes dark comedy for an entirely different effect. The Handmaiden is an absolutely must-see for those who appreciate cinematic greatness."

      "text": "Woof. The Handmaiden is one perverse piece of eroticism. An erotic thriller that shows mastery of suspense akin to Alfred Hitchcock, but with a blending of eroticism akin to Brian De Palma, Paul Verhoeven, or Adrian Lyne, The Handmaiden is a brutally violent and erotic film. Blending eroticism with extreme violence like that found in films such as Basic Instinct, The Handmaiden is a lovingly crafted film that is equal parts horrifying and titillating throughout its run time. Though it suffers from Park Chan-wook's films always feeling too distant and disconnected (personal opinion), The Handmaiden's stark beauty is impossible to deny and this is what lifts it above his other films for me. That said, the plot's suspense and thrills are secondary to the visual beauty of this film, which is striking.Changing the novel's location from Victorian England to Korea under Japanese rule, Park Chan-wook's film still feels Victorian. With the regality and the building design often reflecting the castles and mansions one could find in Victorian England, The Handmaiden still shows that influence. Yet, of course, these buildings are entirely Japanese/Korean. The interior design reflects this in the home of Uncle Kouzuki (Cho Jin-woong), as it is entirely Japanese and feels like something one could find in a film by Akira Kurosawa. Lavish, regal, and alive in its own rights, these buildings are intricate, detailed, and absolutely lovely. The interior and the exterior are gorgeous with the camera finding just the right ways to capture this beauty. Often shooting from behind the trees, the home is usually somewhat obscured in the darkness, instilling an ominous feeling about this place. The trees add to the distance communicated by the entire film, as Park Chan-wook never fully let's you in and keeps you an arm's length away from the proceedings. This is captured in the cinematography, but even then, the visuals are strikingly gorgeous.This production design is further felt by the aforementioned cinematography that takes full advantage of the beauty on display. Every shot is gorgeous and lovingly crafted. Not a single frame of this film feels out of place and really flows together and is entirely engrossing. This is a dark, disturbing film, but the visuals communicate an odd beauty and romance to this violence and disturbing level of sexuality. Of course, it is benefited by the framing and staging. Every moment is precise, definitive, and decisive. Not a foot is put wrong in this film where each actor communicating their character brilliantly and breathing life into the film with every step they take. It is the movement of the characters that makes this a full-fledged visual masterpiece as it manages to add yet another layer to visual approach of this film. Beyond the production design, staging, and cinematography, the costume design is also brilliant with each design representing the lavish and royal lifestyle of its characters. The design's are intricate, well put together, and lovely to look at throughout the film.Though an erotic psychological thriller with a penchant for violence and disturbing moments, The Handmaiden is also darkly comedic. For instance, one such comedy scene finds Sook-hee (Kim Tae-ri) holding up Lady Hideko (Kim Min-hee) to prevent her from hanging herself. Upon learning distressing news, she runs off to cry only to quickly realize she has left her Ladyship strangling herself from the branch. Additionally, the multiple depictions of tentacles and the octopus in the basement are hysterical tongue-in-cheek additions by Park. And of course, the scene where Hideko has intercourse - supposedly - with a knife. Really off-the-wall, uncensored, and truly outrageous moments that add some darkly comic twists to a film that is dark, dark, dark.Sexually, The Handmaiden is very much like a Verhoeven film. Though more pristine and less gritty, the scenes are shot to titillate. Park Chan-wook exploits his seemingly lesbian characters for the enjoyment of male viewers with classic lesbian sex scenes occurring that, regardless of their practicality, exist solely to entertain the male audience. This is very much like what people like De Palma or Verhoeven would include in their film, though it would be shot differently. Park Chan-wook's stages these sex scenes almost symmetrically at times and very rigidly. The scenes are tense, sensual, and almost regal is how they appear and look. It feels more like a Todd Haynes sex scene from Carol in this regard, as it feels pristine. Now, of course, Haynes' lesbian sex moment is far more withdrawn and focused on the passion and love. It is intimate, not exploitative. The Handmaiden exploits its characters' sexuality for the purposes of male entertainment, which is a shame."

Je pense que je n'en ai pas vu assez pour produire une analyse constructive mais je constate tout de m\u00eame une profonde sensation d'exotisme et de fascination pour ce cin\u00e9ma. 90% de ce que j'ai vu \u00e9tant fran\u00e7ais ou am\u00e9ricain.Les processus de r\u00e9flexion, les mani\u00e8res de jouer, les sc\u00e9narios, les p\u00e9rip\u00e9ties et les choix sont diff\u00e9rents. C'est fabuleux \u00e0 quel point le cin\u00e9ma est un pont qui initie et invite a d\u00e9couvrir la culture d'un pays. J'ai ador\u00e9 The handmaiden. Je ne revois jamais un film car je me dit toujours que d\u00e9j\u00e0 qu'il y en a beaucoup trop pour tous les voir, il ne faut pas s'attarder futilement sur certains (sauf si il y a un coup de foudre qui touche au soi profond). Cependant le film, par sa narration en trois actes qui montre diff\u00e9rentes facettes des personnages dans de m\u00eames sc\u00e8nes film\u00e9es diff\u00e9remment \u00e0 chaque fois, nous fait cr\u00e9er beaucoup de lien avec les personnages. Je me suis vraiment attach\u00e9 avec amour et sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9 \u00e0 cet univers si diff\u00e9rent du mien et si fascinant (alors que c'est horrible !) et surtout aux personnages. J'aime la masculinit\u00e9 de Sookee. J'aime sa mani\u00e8re d'interagir avec son environnement. Elle est constamment film\u00e9e en train d'accomplir des choses manuelles et elle a une mani\u00e8re de proc\u00e9der qui m'hypnotise. Les mouvements sont toujours un peu maladroit mais tr\u00e8s d\u00e9termin\u00e9s. Toujours avec une fiert\u00e9 et une agressivit\u00e9 fougueuse dans ce petit corps qui au d\u00e9part nous inspirait la fragilit\u00e9. D'ailleurs au d\u00e9but du film alors que l'on ne connaissait pas Sookee, j'ai imm\u00e9diatement pr\u00e9jug\u00e9 par son comportement qu'on allait encore me servir un film ponc\u00e9 \u00e0 la Hollywood o\u00f9 la femme est plus faible, moins s\u00fbr d'elle, gentille et pr\u00e9occup\u00e9e par des choses futiles. Ce n'est que pendant sa voix off de pr\u00e9sentation que le film apporte v\u00e9ritablement une profondeur \u00e0 ce personnage qui prend un tout autre aspect. Et dans ce corps \u00e0 priori faible et f\u00e9minin se cache une vigueur et une d\u00e9termination camoufl\u00e9e. Elle joue d'ailleurs de cette apparence ce qui la rend encore plus intrigante. Un autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment qui m'a frapp\u00e9 et m'a troubl\u00e9 pour plusieurs semaines je pense, c'est la sublimation du corps de la femme asiatique.The handmaiden est le premier film que je vois qui magnifie les femmes typ\u00e9es d\u2019extr\u00eame-orient. Elles sont film\u00e9es dans de si beaux plans, parfois sym\u00e9triques comme des tableaux en mouvement (ou pas) et un certain grain que je ne saurais expliquer qui donne un r\u00e9alisme historique et pictural.Les femmes sont belles mais pas seulement physiquement. C'est la mise en sc\u00e8ne et le sc\u00e9nario qui les subliment.C'est d'ailleurs une mise en abyme assez rigolote. On regarde un film avec des sc\u00e8nes de sexe tr\u00e8s visuelles et nombreuses avec une volont\u00e9 de filmer ces actes pour faire avancer le sc\u00e9nario, pour la beaut\u00e9 de ces mouvements et cr\u00e9er de l'enjeu entre les personnages. Mais le film critique et place en antagoniste un pervers qui ne lis que des livres pornographiques avec un club cr\u00e9\u00e9 autour de sa passion. On est donc des voyeurs complices de sc\u00e8nes tr\u00e8s \u00e9rotiques dans un film qui critique la perversion et l'objectification de la femme. Cela me fait penser \u00e0 la sc\u00e8ne d'Inglorious Bastards o\u00f9 les nazis regardent un film d'une violence inou\u00efe que nous trouvons pitoyable et grotesque alors que nous regardons exactement la m\u00eame chose avec le massacre du th\u00e9\u00e2tre qui s'ensuit.J'ai vu beaucoup de films de 2016 cette ann\u00e9e. De tr\u00e8s bon films. J'avais pourtant du mal \u00e0 d\u00e9cider lequel serait l'\u00e9lu de mon coeur comme meilleur film de 2016. Rogue One m'a fait le plus voyager, Your Name m'a fait presque pleur\u00e9 d'\u00e9motion mais The handmaiden m'a tout simplement s\u00e9duit et bien qu'un peu long, je le reverrai un jour. C'est donc mon film pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 de 2016 (surtout que c'est classe d'avoir comme favori un film cor\u00e9en obscur pour la pl\u00e8be ;)J'esp\u00e8re qu'elles vivront heureuses ensemble..."

      "text": "In the circle of romance, deceive and defraud.Those who are into the world cinema, particularly the Korean, knows Park Chan-wook very well. But if you don't, then you must. His films are definitely for the grown ups. Like everybody else, my admiration for his work has started a decade ago with the film 'Oldboy'. He had tried his luck in Hollywood with 'Stoker'. Despite a good entertainer, it was criticised. I love Park Chan-wook doing hundred masterpieces like this in Korea than trying to do one in Hollywood. His ability to turn the good book into a great flick was phenomenal. Here it goes another one. This was based on the British novel 'Fingersmith' by Sarah Waters. The story of an orphan woman who assigned to be a maid for a young rich woman who is living under the shadow of her uncle since she has no parents.Yeah, I was expecting it, but I did not think it would be another masterpiece from the director. I even thought the ratings could be exaggerated, and the reviews from his die hard fans like Nolan's or QT's fans does. The timeline of the story was prior to Second World War Korea under the Japan rule. A perfect setting for such theme. The film opened like it is an average film. That's where all I got wrong. Or probably I judged it too soon. The storytelling was split into three parts and the first part was a bit mix of fun and like any film, introduction, the platform for the rest of the narration filled with surprises.The young orphan Sook-hee was recruited by a thief who is planning to trick a young woman named Lady Hideko with all the wealth left behind by her parents. The only obstacle for him is her uncle, a guardian. So Sook-hee becomes close to her. More than she had expected, but their plan is working. Now they have to wait for the perfect moment for a perfect strike. When it arrives, an unexpected twist takes the tale to go back to where the film originally had started. But even further earlier and this time, the perspective of the story was from the Lady Hdeko.\u275dSo even if my love for you leads me to ruin, don't pity me.\u275eSo, with that flashback, the second part begins. But literally it was a series of twist, that keep explaining us in another angle of the whole scenario I had witnessed in the previous part. Believe me, I have never seen such a long twist before. I was like unmoved for that entire segment. One of the best things I have ever in a film. The praise must go to the author, but the director and his actors as well did a fine job. There's a twist in every scene. So, for that one must pay close attention to the first part, despite slow moving story.But above all, what I'm surprised was I did not know it was a lesbian film. Moreover, I did not think it could have bold scenes for such theme. Everything seemed perfect. I mean the erotic parts are sensual, but very artistic than unnecessary disturbance. Mainly because of stronger hold of the story narration than anything else. Even the pace picks up, like a crazy speed. Everything about the film you would learn in this section. All the secrets of the past revealed and what might comes are still kept under mysterious for the third and final part.The most awaited, the conclusion part begins forth. For everything we saw so far, what might come after makes this film at its best. Just like the mid part, this is also full of twists. Because it will going to tell who ends where and what they get. Over two hours long film, and every frame are worth. The casting was best and so the setting of the 1930s Korea. Especially I must applaud the filmmaker's effort to turn the original setting from Europe to East Asia. It was great, but still now and then you can see the influence of the original source. I mean western culture, names, architect references which might have come from the book.Not just the lesbian or a love triangle story, but something like a circle of love with deceive and defraud. You can notice that in the film poster with four main characters. So when it has a multiple strings attached, you could expect surprises/twists from each angle and it gives that more the convincingly. Put this into your must see list. This is not the first screen adaptation, but surely the best so far. Now we can expect a European or a Hollywood project in a big scale soon. Believe me the Oscars would pour in, because it's that kind of story. Highly recommended!8/10"

Park's version definitely takes some liberties with the plot, and in some ways better than the original. However he also goes a bit graphic, kinky & gratuitous (e.g. you can tell it's a dude directing with some key sex scenes) and things get almost comic-booky, but I still totally enjoyed it and he definitely captures the solid romance that underlies Fingersmith. There's some real comedy in there as well which was totally surprising and perfect. The cinematography was absolutely stunning. If you have a chance to see this movie in theaters, do it."

      "text": "This movie is by far one of the smartest and as most well-made movies of the last decade, and illustrate's the peak of global cinema. Not only is this movie intricately crafted and intensely rewarding, but it has an incredible amount of content to offer and is incredibly visceral. The plot is razor-sharp, and by the movie's final resolution, every twist feels earned and satisfying. The flick runs the gambit on the content that it features, ranging from erotic to dramatic to gory, never overly dwelling on any one subject but also not shying away from showing the extent of abuse and ecstasy of the character's journeys.\tThe movie's plot structure is one of great deception, but also great pay off. The first act allows for an introduction to the setting and most of the characters and, while it feels rushed and slightly clunky, this is by design, setting up for the later development of the characters and setting in the following acts. From this point on, the plot turns back on itself, seeming to undo everything already established; this, however, is also revealed to be somewhat of a ruse as the plot ties knots in itself, introducing new dynamics and histories to previously introduced characters. Despite its constant weaving, the movie ultimately plays fair and gives the viewer exactly what they need to understand the characters' motivations and the story's direction. The final act of the film is filled with the height of the film's eroticism and violence tieing up all the loose ends in a satisfactory manner. The tension builds and builds, interspersed with scenes of visceral love and passion, finally ending in a way that brings back many of the introduced elements. While some of the reincorporation is obvious, others are callbacks to moments where the viewer's attention was encapsulated by everything else happening on screen.\tAside from the structure, the movie also excels in its presentation of its characters and story. The characters are all very deceitful and multifaceted, each having their independent drives that constantly clash, creating the tension that serves to fuel the movie's progression. The acting was spellbinding and often even mesmerizing, Tae-Ri Kim (who played the handmaiden) had so much emotion, compassion, and love imbued within her actions that it was hard to imagine her, existing outside of her character. Min-Hee Kim (Lady Hideko) was similarly emotionally volatile, but hers had an added layer of intricacy due to her character's history of emotional, physical, and sexual abuse. Both the handmaiden and Lady Hideko are objectified and toyed around for much of the film, but this changes once they come into themselves and realize the extent of their potential empowerment. While the movie is initially about men extorting women, it quickly turns in to women using their perceived subjugation to attain dominance in a hierarchy. The film's main antagonist, Count Fujiwara (played by Jung-woo Ha), is the driving force of the film, and the resolution to his character arc is one the most satisfying of the film.\tThe movie, explicitly about the changing dynamics of a subset of characters, is more broadly a look at the relations between Japan and Korea, especially during the Japanese occupation of Korea. Through this lens, the film explores identity and heritage and how the inherited versions of these can impact the way we approach and live our lives. Many of the characters go to great lengths to disown their Korean heritage because, at the time, the Japanese were seen to be the superior culture. To this extent, many of the characters destroy parts of themselves to put on a more socially conforming facade, often doing irreversible damage that causes lasting impacts. The movie suggests that in a climate of heightened deception and discrimination, staying true to one's character and beliefs is one of the most healthy things one can do. The characters' admiration of the traditional Japanese books, specifically during the auction scenes, shows how demented the Korean characters' self-effacement has become within the purview of the film's world. That the wealthy elites hold forged pornographic works to a higher standard than they do the Koreans that posses them is the sole illustrator of this fact.\tThe Handmaiden is thought-provoking sensual, but most of all rewarding; despite being over 2.5 hours, I felt constantly engrossed and on the edge of my seat. I would also like to note that the film's depiction of mental health and suicide is rather nuanced and authentic, i.e. they are influenced by the abuse/actions of others and rarely exist solely in a vacuum. Specifically, this is shown when the aunt's suicide was, in reality, a murder. I would recommend this movie to anyone, it has something for everyone and provides more than could ever be asked for."

You can tell the korean is an amazing director, but I did have some issues to care for the characters and I was bored a bit through its second act. Nevertheless, I'm pretty sure this one will get better with time."

      "text": "I did not find it as good as the score here did. That aside, it was a decent film. In terms of sensuality, I was a bit disappointed. It was all I could hear about the film, and how it would be tense, and when the tooth scene came up so quickly and intensely, I was intrigued for the rest of the movie. But it let up, and there wasn't much sensuality that was as engaging aside from the first bed scene. I believe that the reception of the movie as extremely sexy perhaps has more to do with the lesbian aspect of the film as opposed to the actual sensual aspect. And perhaps that also has to do with lesbianism in South Korea, though I don't know much on the topic. Something disappointing as well was that the twists in the plot became somewhat predictable. The first one was surprising, though not in a way that sticks with the viewer. I think that they shot the scenes with different takes to change subtly change the interactions of the characters across the parts, like in American Psycho with Bale and Dafoe, but it's only my impression, I'm not sure. All in all, a pretty decent movie."

I enjoyed the narrative fine on its own, and i even find myself thinking about it sometimes, plus as we all know this movie is visually stunning..... but its also CLEARLY written by a man. Especially the love scenes, it feels oppressively pornographic and kind of embarrassing to watch. There is also way too many scenes where a male character forces himself on a woman. I understand the point they went for here but sometimes its just too much (and really uncomfortable). I'm still not quite sure what the audience for this movie was supposed to be. I understand that this is a very important movie for korea- and it has a very happy ending! So its immediately way better than most english lesbian films, but uh anyways if youre like me you probably wont be as impressed with this film as most seem to be, so dont get your hopes too high because you saw the bathtub scene online (like me)"
