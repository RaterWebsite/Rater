Lee Ermey as Sergeant Hartman. A great turn too by a young Vincent D'Onofrio as the blundering Private Pyle.The second half of the film sees Matthew Modine's character go into the action in Vietnam & I think it loses a bit of steam here.It is well written, the action scenes with the sniper are intense but it doesn't really go anywhere.Mention also for the great soundtrack featuring the Bird is the Word & Woolley Bully!"

The climax is around 35-40 minutes in, which is delightfully unusual. This isn't a Hollywood war epic, but a graphic study of the haunted and tortured soldiers of Vietnam."

      "text": "[***PLOT SPOILERS***] At the start of this film, I was laughing uncontrollably from the cliche of a tough boot camp instructor treating recruits like sh.t smudged a minion times against their mother's faces. He kept calling them degrading names such as sluts, pussies et. al. But then as the movie progresses on, I was drawn to Private Pyle, who had an obvious bad case of A.D.D. Initially, I was quite irritated of him with his clumsiness and slow pick up abilities to their unforgiving trainor. Due to Pyle's excess weight which obviously made him unable to keep up with the harsh physical rigors of training, he was kept from eating sweets and the teacher found out how Pyle caped a doughnut. He was made to eat it infront of his classmates while they were punished for him. Everytime he f...ed up, it was his classmates who paid for it. He was beaten with bricks [Ed: Soap, actually] while he was prevented from making a sound by his co-trainees when they got fed up of him. The only one who used to bear with him by necessity, Private Joker, didn't do anything about it. After it, Pyle cried like a child bullied in a kindergarden yard. And it was my first time to really sympathize with a character, I bawled like a baby too. I was just so moved how nobody stood up for him. It's been two days since I've watched FMJ, but the face of Pyle keeps haunting me. The cinematography of the film and the plot when they got to 'Nam sucks big time, but kudos to Kubrick for tugging my cynical heart. It's kinda new for me to be troubled by a film character, and for that, good job Kubrick."

Unlike Band of Brothers or Saving Private Ryan, FMJ takes a look into a soldiers psycie. It shows us how these guys actually went through hell to become Marines and how they are put under so much stress and pressure. Its more about their journey into the war than the war itself and that's what makes this movie stand out. Just an incredible film that is sure to be a classic if it isnt already."

And definitely, if it was a successful movie, it would be the best war movie in the history of cinema. But the film does not match the logic of Kubrick's filmmaking and the director's subconscious. The logic of Kubrick's filmmaking is not that, for example, The camera is in favor of the soldier at the beginning of the film, or that it condemns such militarism. This type of narration is definitely simplistic. Maybe my idea also agrees with the director's point of view, but because it is not completely realistic in the movie , The movie is unsuccessful. However, it is a great movie, but it is not the greatest war movie in the history of cinema like \"paths of Glory\"."

It starts out as a vicious, surreal, and engagingly strange vision when it's in the boot camp stage of things, but when the characters go to war it starts to fall apart.  You can definitely tell that it's a Kubrick movie. It has all of his signature style, such as his use of the wide angle lens and backwards moving cameras.  But this movie can't escape its second half.  Its second half feels empty and lifeless.  It also doesn't help that it ends on an anti climactic note.  It starts out feeling like it's going to be something epic, but ends being contrived, and forgettable, and therefore Kubrick's vision loses most of its power."

Full Metal Jacket is a harrowing, violent and foul-mouthed film, yet it is superbly done. True, one or two parts may lack tropical realism, but the atmosphere the film creates is extraordinary. The film looks excellent with skillful cinematography. The script is very well crafted and does have a sense of realism, while the story is compelling with the transition from the training at the camp to the bombed Vietamnesse city smoothly done. I am with those who thinks the first half is better than the second, but that is not to say the second half isn't good, it is more than good, but the first half really was outstanding. Kubrick's direction as always is superb, as is the acting especially Lee Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio. All in all, one of Kubrick's best and one of the best war movies you will see. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

In the prostittue/theater scene, I realized that only in the widescreen version of the film could you see certain background visuals. At present FMJ is available in letterboxed format from Warner Bros. only in HD DVD, which is where the DVD technology is headed. They (Congress is included in \"they.\") want us to start all over again in both the player and disc. It's really unfair. The picture is much better, but, using FMJ as an example, I've bought it in VHS, then DVD, then again in 5.1 SS DVD, and would buy it again in letterboxed format, but switching to a new DVD format is asking too much. Apparently, we're missing a good bit in this modified version of the film. I've emailed WB's site, pleading for a widescreen release in the present DVD format and maybe they would if enough people showed an interest. This excellent, very intelligent and challenging film deserves release in its proper format without having to buy a $1,000.00 DVD player. Among comtemporary filmmakers, Kubrick was without peers and I would rank him above Welles, though I'm sure this comment will cause many film buffs to go ape."

      "text": "Stanley Kubrick's daunting two-part monolith also communicates on a gut level, yet it is the most deceptively simple work he has ever made--and even more resistant to easy interpretation than his 2001: A Space Odyssey. A friend of mine who was a Marine sergeant in the Tet offensive assures me that so many details are botched that the film is worthless as history; insofar as coscreenwriter Michael Herr has recently pointed out that Kubrick set out to make a certain kind of war film before he settled on either Vietnam or Gustav Hasford's novel The Short-Timers, I see no reason to doubt this testimony. But conventional realism seems so far from Kubrick's purposes that I can't dismiss the film for these infidelities either. I'm more inclined to ponder lead actor Matthew Modine's provocative suggestion that Kubrick's relationship to other commercial directors is analogous to the position of the early Cubists. Combining this sense of poetic abstraction with a subject as \"hot\" as Vietnam (or colonialism in general) is a risky and daring move, but I can't side with those who fault Kubrick for \"coldness\" simply because they can't anticipate or see through him (as they can with a genuine iceberg like Brian De Palma). It's been at least a quarter of a century since I've seen Kubrick's awkward first feature Fear and Desire (1953)--long since suppressed by Kubrick himself--but it is that touching and compassionate amateur film about young men at war, set in no particular place or time, that Full Metal Jacket evoked for me, refined, perfected, and chiseled to such a fine point that it fully expresses what the earlier film only implied. The vision may be hard as nails, but it is one without villains or other easy bromides."

Kubrick uses unsettling humour here to test our limits and although a lot of us don't want to laugh at the thought of soldiers-in-training being abused and being referred to as maggots we simply cannot help ourselves as R. Lee Ermey seems to make it look acceptable with his outstanding performance. After the shock at the end of bootcamp, the film progresses straight to the Vietnam war with those soldiers now in the thick of the action; although the result of this is rather disappointing. The cast here is faultless but the action and the imagination that we have to come to love of Kubrick is not here in full stretch and although there are still moments of greatness it doesn't come close to the first half. The ending of this film makes up for the rest of the half however and really is thought provoking stuff. This could've been Kubrick's best but unfortunately cannot add up to the greatness of the director's previous works such as A Clockwork Orange or 2001. Still worth a watch however and is still one of the best films in the war movie genre if not the best."

This connection made the events here all the more tragic and hard to watch. The acting here is great, especially from R. Lee Ermey, who really steals the show. Stanley Kubrick's direction is fabolous as expected as well. The first half here is also far superior to the second half, in large part thanks to Ermey, but really, all of the events in the first half are much better presented than the second half, which at times, can be a little odd in the way things occur. But, the second half is still quite good, even if a little bit of a drop off from the perfect first half.

Whereas the first stage explained how young men lost their humanity and succumbed to brutality, their struggle in Hue was a bit of an irony as they, in spite of superior equipment and manpower, managed to take down just one little 12-year-old-like Vietnamese female sniper only after suffering three fatal casualties.

      "text": "Full Metal Jacket was released in 1987 and directed by Stanley Kubrick and is set during the Vietnam War. The movie follows the journey of a marine nicknamed Private Joker through Vietnam, starting in boot camp and eventually ending up in the war.The first half of the film is set in boot camp and is amazing, one of the reasons for that being the drill instructor. Apparently, the actor who portrayed him used to do drill instructing himself so he was just left to say what he wanted to say as he knews what one would say in a real situation. This adds a sense of realism to it and that is one of the main things I like about this film- it feels very realistic and feels like you're experiencing war with them. Private Pyle was very well portrayed and his journey through boot camp is very engaging and goes places you probably wouldn't expect at times. Matthew Modine was also good as Joker, with his charisma, courageousness and relatability as a character.The grittiness of war is displayed really well, in particular in the boot camp. You see that the marines don't get to have their say and are treated like animals. Private Pyle's character shows perfectly how all of this can affect someone.The second half of the film is Joker when he is actually in the war. The quality does definitely drop here and I thought the pacing was a little off at times and it also got quite dull sometimes but it was still entertaining and the final act was very gripping and I really enjoyed it; it was constantly tense and if you watch it you'll probably see what I mean.Upon first viewing, I was quite confused as to all of the events in the second half linked together and how they were relevant to the first half but now that I've gone back over the story I understand it now and I appreciate it more now.As I stated earlier, I love how the film feels very realistic and the reason it feels like this is for the great characters I believe. Also mentioned earlier, it makes you feel like you're experiencing these events with them.Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. The first half was absolutely amazing and while the quality did drop in the second half, it was still enjoyable with a great final act and the performances for the drill instructor and Private Pyle are great. Joker is also a good main character to root for.8.2/10"

      "text": "FMJ is a great war film with great performances from Matthew Modine, Vincent D'Onofrio, Adam Baldwin, Arliss Howard and especially that of the late Ronald Lee Ermey. The bootcamp part is a classic, brutal depiction of a Marine boot camp during the Vietnam War. The Vietnam part is almost trippy showing the growing disillusion of a unit of men before the climatic battle with a Viet Cong sniper.Rest in peace Gunny Hope you train the devil dogs in heaven. 1944-2018"

      "text": "2 movies in one, literally. Kubrick makes movies for the artist, the true inspired artist. And makes them for his own sense of crazed invigoration and when one looks at Full Metal Jacket, and then one watches Full Metal Jacket, you completely and utterly understand and realize why movies can be something greater than pop entertainment. They can be something to revere or admire or even obsess about. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's the kind of tea I like."

      "text": "sir, no sir..Full Metal JacketJust like The Clockwork Orange, it takes too much time to prove a point and even though it is finely detailed and explicitly executed the journey for around 2 hours just doesn't seem worthy at the end. Stanley Kubrick's smart adaptation and perfect execution works on its level and won't disappoint the fans but fails to deliver anything beyond that as the mere far fetched idea fades off slowly before one's eyes where even lousy editing too, becomes responsible. Matthew Modine at the centre of it pulls it off swiftly and smoothly but is overpowered by a stunning performance by Vincent D'Onofrio despite of just being a supportive character. Full Metal Jacket resonates too much with The Clockwork Orange as it raises similar questions, offers enough doubts and thrills which becomes redundant at a certain point and as always lacks better editing."
