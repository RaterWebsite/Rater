The less you know about the story going in, the more you'll enjoy it. Fans of the novel are in for an impeccable and precise adaptation of the source material.  Fincher nails the tone and sustains it effortlessly for the entire running time."

What started off as a reasonably interesting mystery, turns very ridiculous very quickly, and then descend into absurdity. Once the movie takes \"that\" dreaded turn, everything from the acting and dialogue turns into a cheap made-for-tv melodrama you'd find on Lifetime. This is a rental folks."

He did an amazing job and you could really see that Fincher has helped Ben become a better actor. Rosamund Pike was amazing and I seriously think she was robbed at the Oscars. Great performance from everyone and we got exactly what we expected from David Fincher, a masterfully cratered movie from start to finish."

He's also one of those who likes to keep twisting your perspective of each character around and around until you don't even know how to feel. The ending really was tormenting in both the good and bad way. While it tied the story up nicely, it left a bad taste in my mouth. Rosamund Pike does well with the psycho crazy and Ben Affleck is pretty good at playing Ben Affleck."

The way this film is shot is amazing, every frame is filled with information and detail, the soundtrack while not the most extravagant manages to be captivating and unique, David Fincher did an amazing job, his films feel like distinct universes and different realities than ours because of the uniqueness and complexity of the situations we see in his movies, kudos for all of this.\rThe plot is amazing, it's awesomely complex and so interesting, it manages to gather so many different themes in one storyline while making it feel very natural and realistic, the brutality in this film, the violence, the pressure, these are all elements that come in to make the film feel darker and darker as we go along, and damn, it's a hell of a ride.\rThe only downside that I find in this movie is the ending, I am not saying I dislike open endings but I feel like if we got a solid ending we would be more satisfied, as the movie takes most of it's time during the second act, it leaves the third act with less time than it should have had, this time could be used to develop the ending in a more solid ways, as it feels like some parts of it were chopped of for time's sake.\rUltimately I absolutely recommend everyone to go and watch this movie, it's a true masterpiece of today's cinema and the reason why I like movies so much, because this ain't just movie, this is an experience."

If you like movies, whose development you can't guess, this one is for you. An intricate story, almost insane.. not almost, but you know. This movie shows how some people pain can become a madness, that is rooted in complete revenge. The protagonist Amy is hiding is hiding behind a mask of a successful, intelligent and independent woman, who has many hobbies, can handle with everything and is also happy. In fact, that's what her parents want her to be and how they actually see her. She found a guy, that change her life and make her really happy, but then he turn out to be a **** selfish person, who start ignoring her  and act like she is nothing. Sooo the revenge comes and it's so satisfying.    .Outstanding acting, fascinating story with unbelievable plot twist. Must watch for thriller fans out there!"

In my opinion, this is David Fincher's best work as a director. Every shot is immaculate. The soundtrack is tense. Every performance is too real. The story, written by Gillian Flynn (the author of the novel this movie is based on) is filled with twists and turns, and will have you guessing and leave you shocked with every development until the very end. The ending of this movie is so satisfying and shocking, and I won't spoil anything about it!Gone Girl is a very cleverly done meta of a film. At it's core, this is a movie about secrets, manipulation, lies, and ultimately a conflict between men, women, and how relationships are perceived by society vs. how relationships actually are. The performances by Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike are jaw dropping. Easily their best work. Carrie Coon is incredible as always, and even Tyler Perry busts out some great acting chops.This is a must-see movie.

The shock of finding it had received universal acclaim is far more surprising than any twists found in this awful movie.  Even suspending disbelief to enjoy some of the wildly implausible aspects of the plot (and there are MANY to choose from), there are ridiculous 180-degree character shifts that occur with nearly no explanation, development or understanding in order to propel this train wreck into the station.  Ben Affleck is cast perfectly as the unfaithful husband as it usually doesn't take more than a single frame to make Ben Affleck unlikable (I kid!) but he's hardly to blame here.  The screenplay is loaded with cringe worthy clunkers that do nothing to help this long winded story get anywhere fast.

A brilliant and huge twist that changes everything makes this a very different movie when it happens.\r The longer it progresses the more tense and involving it becomes. It's not afraid to get dark. The way it presents every aspect is amazing. The way the general public reacts to new information shows how easily people's perceptions are twisted when they really have no idea what's going on, but truly want to. Dialog flows meticulously and is believable. The cast is fantastic and they play characters who feel like real people. Real, twisted people.\r It's a masterfully written thriller. One that perhaps does go excessive with it's mature content at times, but this is a mature story so it's to be expected. This is one for an adult audience who enjoys slower, more detailed focused movies. If you're looking for a thriller with a lot of action the look elsewhere.

I have not read the book, and I'm reviewing the film as its own entity.\r The movie\u2019s worth seeing, if only because of the twists, the character of Amy, and the post-movie talking points that are meant to provoke a battle of the sexes debate.\r I did enjoy Fincher branching out in a new direction, and I wouldn't say that it's the wrong direction for him as much as it was a difficult tone to hit for anyone.  The movie sets out to mix melodrama, realistic satire and absurdism. Though I love weird tones and shifting tones, to me the tones in Gone Girl don't always land well or mix well.\r Worse still, there\u2019s inconsistent acting, and wobbly story logic.  The movie isn\u2019t deliberately unreal enough (whether absurd or dreamlike or mythic or farcical etc) to get away with the wobbly story logic.\r I'm not sure the actors are always successful at staying in the same movie together, as mentioned by user-reviewer benutty.  And Affleck (as A-lister personality actors often do) seems to be so intent on 'playing a character with a backbone' that it's basically frigid, unflinching acting where his 'character' doesn't really change or have an interior. We're left watching Affleck bring the role to himself so entirely that he's not really doing anything. It's just flat acting that has about the same tone all the way through. (And it's not unlike the frigidity that Casey Affleck has in Gone Baby Gone, directed by Ben Affleck) I think this is partly dismissible by the character's degree of narcissism and shallowness, but not entirely.\r But\u2026 I have toyed around with the idea that Fincher and Flynn are jazzing around metafictionally here.  I\u2019m not convinced that they are, or that they did it well if intended.  But at some point, two intelligent artists may have discussed how a man is to direct a woman\u2019s novel/screenplay of this sort.\r IF they baked a metafiction joke into it, the setup clearly runs through Affleck\u2019s under-emoting, under-engaged acting that undermines the story, and through the way that nearly every story logic problem serves to make Amy more amazing.  And the meta-joke, if there is one, only plays if you see the characters as puppets, more or less:  The psychopathically overengaged, self-justified modern wife who gets to always be right, and the self-centered, resentful boy-husband who takes her just barely seriously enough to subtly manipulate back and stay alive.\r Yet... I'm not sure I want to give Affleck the benefit of the doubt that his practically unchanging tone and lack of interior were all just a brilliant meta-joke."
