The action is grisly but not gratuitous in any way. The fights on offer here are integral to the story. There is so much emotional gravitas in the final battle that it might well be the greatest end fight in movie history. Basically speaking, Gladiator is perfect."

Both Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix are incredibly brilliant in their respective roles, however Phoenix deserves tons of props for pulling off a convincing evil emporer. Connie Nielsen almost steals the show at times while playing Lucille (Commodus' sister). When all the dust settles from brutal voilence (in the name of good sport), Gladiator stands as one of the most excellently crafted films and will likely hold its place in time as one of the greatest war/action films ever. Ridley Scott got this one right"

Ie: \"Gladiator\" is not merely a collection of fighting at the Coliseum in Rome, more or less of spectacular via special effects. And what is it? A real tragedy of inner power, underpinned by a subtle and intelligent argument that favors relations backstage and shades of political discourse. Gladiator is a true intimate epic, served by some remarkable compositions of his cast, especially almost inevitable for Joaquin Phoenix, impeccable characterization of a tissue power of ambition, blindness and fear. Ultimately, we are faced with a symphonic work whose themes and variations are wonderfully scored music by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard. Moreover, it is always interesting to watch the rising of a star - Russell Crowe."

The dialogue between Maxmus and his new black-skinned friend is entertaining. Talking about their family, heaven, god etc. It is a shame that Gladiator 2 will leave Russel Crowe out (he died in the end of the first part), he was the hightlight of the movie. Oh well......"

I don't expect to like the villain, their actions, or their beliefs, but I usually like to see some sort of redeeming quality. But even in that case there was a rational explanation for his behavior, and his character was well written none the less. I don't know what movie that guy at the Washington Post was watching, because there is no way he could have rated such an epic movie so poorly. I guess the user scores ratings and the sheer amount of awards the movie has won(wiki says its won 48 different awards) are more accurate depictions of the movie that the reviews that were published. I wouldn't say the movie is perfect, but."

      "text": "Late in the second century Maximus Meridius leads the Roman armies fight in Germania with the knowledge that ailing Emperor Marcus Aurelius has earmarked him to run the empire alongside the senate when he passes away. His son however has other ideas. Angered by what he feels is a betrayal he sets about exerting his murderous authority and Maximus, having refused to swear his loyalty, only narrowly escapes with his life. Bent on vengeance Maximus later returns to Rome as a gladiator hoping to take down the new emperor.\r Aside from a few plot holes Gladiator is peerless in its quality. Russell Crowe, always an excellent actor, plays his defining role, his presence commanding attention throughout the film and the supporting cast do well not to be completely overshadowed by his performance. The action sequences are brilliantly shot and staggering in their realism as all the gory details are shown. As the film reaches its climax this all combines to make it impossible to not root for Maximus in what is arguably the movie of the decade."

Gladiator should be up there as one of the best films he's done, if not the best. Almost everything on screen is very graphic, making some scenes upsetting to watch, but the visuals are just outstanding. The music score by Hans Zimmer just adds to the drama that is already there in the script. which is well written and rather Shakespearean. The performances were brilliant, especially Joaquin Pheonix and Oliver Reed. Russell Crowe is wholly convincing in the title role, and Richard Harris and Connie Nielson are also excellent. The costumes are brilliant, as well as the sets. In conclusion, Gladiator is a near masterpiece, only marred by some upsetting scenes. 9/10 Bethany Cox."

      "text": "A muscular and bloody combat picture, a compelling revenge drama and a truly transporting trip back nearly 2,000 years, Ridley Scott\u2019s bold epic of imperial intrigue and heroism brings new luster and excitement to a tarnished and often derided genre that nonetheless provided at least one generation of moviegoers with some of its most cherished youthful memories.\r Jagged and impressionistic in a way clearly influenced by \u201cSaving Private Ryan,\u201d 10-minute opening battle is a savage spectacle, as General Maximus (Crowe) commands his troops to \u201cunleash hell\u201d on their overmatched adversaries with a deluge of arrows and flaming canisters that set the barbarians\u2019 protective woods on fire.But as external conflicts are put to rest, internal trouble is only beginning. The arrogant and unbalanced Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) arrives at the front, along with his beautiful older sister, Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), just in time to learn that his ailing father (Richard Harris) has named the triumphant Maximus his successor as emperor. For his part, Maximus, a Spaniard who has never seen Rome and, far more important, has been separated from his wife and son for nearly three years, wants no part of this plan.But Maximus makes the mistake of spurning Commodus. After killing his father in a fit of jealous spite, the insecure new emperor orders the execution of the popular general. The resourceful Maximus escapes this fate but reaches home too late; when he arrives, he finds his wife and son dead, his farm torched. In the poetic manner of Sergio Leone, Scott uses a man of action\u2019s bitter and idealized memory of his lost family as a motif and a motive for the single-minded pursuit to which he devotes the remainder of his life.\r At the 45-minute mark, action shifts to a distant North African outpost of the empire, where the captive Maximus is taken as slave. Purchased by gladiatorial entrepreneur Proximo (Oliver Reed), Maximus conceals his true identity but, when thrown into the arena for the first time, he fights well as a team with the African Juba (Djimon Hounsou), who will become his closest confidant.\r In the meantime, of course, Maximus must survive arena combat that is heavily rigged against him. The gladiatorial contests are tense, dynamic and brutal, to be sure, and probably no less or more violent than most viewers would want them to be. Less fetishistic about the weaponry and modes of fighting than \u201cSpartacus\u201d and some other Roman combat pictures of yore, \u201cGladiator,\u201d with its fast flurries of action and jump cuts, emphasizes the ferocious speed and urgency of every move in the arena, to the slight detriment of spatial unity and action continuity; in terms of the classical building of tension in a one-on-one fight, the standard is still the Anthony Quinn-Jack Palance battle in Richard Fleischer\u2019s \u201cBarabbas.\u201d\r But \u201cGladiator\u201d enjoys a solid foundation in the strength of Maximus, the vividness of its evocation of the Roman world and the integrity of the story arc. Script by David Franzoni, John Logan and William Nicholson shrewdly appropriates touchstone moments from previous epics, just as it also cuts down the talk to a minimum when possible; there is none of the windy speechifying that ground many an epic to a halt in decades past. The action is presented in strictly Roman terms, with none of the Judeo-Christian angle so common to the genre in the \u201950s.\r The film revels in both the glory and the horror that were Rome. Proximo\u2019s luminous description of the Colosseum to Maximus beautifully conjures an image of what was then the center of the universe, and the games themselves are presented in context as gaudy, lowbrow entertainment. Countless details in Arthur Max\u2019s brilliant production design and Janty Yates\u2019 highly diversified costume design are offered up in wonderfully offhand fashion.\r But the scene stealer, in his last role before his death on location, is Reed, who hadn\u2019t brought such relish to a performance in years, and to whom the film is dedicated. Proximo\u2019s excitement over being able to return to Rome brings out the old man\u2019s boyish delight in his profession, which he insists is just \u201centertainment,\u201d and Reed clearly reveled in both the physicality and the modestly hammy opportunities the part presented. Pic reps a great sendoff for him and a fine way to be remembered.\r Production represented a gargantuan undertaking in four countries; even if the film is a big hit, it\u2019s unlikely that the genre will come back in any significant way due to the costs involved. CGI effects have allowed numerous sets, notably the Colosseum, to be enhanced in size and spectacle value; the stunts, fights and battles are as forceful and realistic as anyone could want, John Mathieson\u2019s widescreen cinematography is magnificent, and the pacing across 2\u00bd hours is well modulated."
