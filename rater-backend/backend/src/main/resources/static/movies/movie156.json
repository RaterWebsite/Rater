After the first few minutes I was thinking the movie will be boring, because you see a naive boy, the time is the boring 18th century (the behaviour, the fashion, the language) and the duration of the movie is over 3 hours. But the movie is great: It was very interesting to see the development of Barry Lyndon from a naive boy into an experienced man. The movie felt like a biography, but also like a historical documentary, very accurate. Also the pictures were stunning beautiful with a lot of details."

      "text": "Kubrick and the actors put up a long and beautiful show in one night and we are told it spans over years and years.Barry LyndonStanley Kubrick is something I don't get. He is a phenomenon more than he is a person or an artist or a storyteller. His calmness never holds the screen. It should. But it doesn't. Instead, it melts like warm butter. That, right there, remains to be a mystery. The unfathomable perspective that he spins on the known stories is both dangerous and sensual. The long slow seductive process that is exhaustingly beautiful casts a flattering impact on us, leaving us buzzed and provoked on the themes he explores.It is a date night movie in that sense. Despite being ironic in its bones and inhumanly dark in its analysation of the behavior that you would expect. And no, it doesn't shock anywhere to what it has to display. If anything it is a slow burn. You can predict the banality that these characters would go through and it is exactly how it goes. Not only now you are hooked to see the self created doom but also are waiting for Kubrick to put it on screen with his unique visual storytelling skills.The result is pure joy. Perpetually even, balanced in \"how\" it has to say. \"What\" has to say gets deliberately lost into the dust. The film is a character driven journey of a guy trying to fit into the change in the social norms of a bygone era where too, it found difficulty to enhance his views. The film starts from zooming in, framing the world that our protagonist lives in and fails to be unselfish in its vocab. As the film develops the camera zooms out to mock his character that thinks he understood the sacrifices and importance of the others in this world. While the truth of the matter is, Barry Lyndon isn't mature enough to take care of himself, let alone others."

      "text": "Funny what a lense time is. I sought out this film because of the reputation of the director. Without Kubric's touch I think this film would have been terrible, completely forgettable and left to the dustbin of history. It is only through the heightened cinematography of Kubric and his complete, almost compulsive, obsession to historical detail that this film is any good at all. The main character is bad. Not likable or charming. He has zero romantic chemistry with all but one female in the film. And its not the one that would make the most plot sense. Speaking of plot, in keeping with the stylized period painting esthetic of the film, the actors in many scenes are muted so much that the acting comes off wooden and you don't believe characters, especially professing love or fear. Stuff just happens and the narrator (and this film is narration HEAVY) justifies what we will see or just saw. Given that a lot of people will find the moving boring. I'm almost surprised I made it to the credits, the people I was with didn't."

      "text": "This is on one hand quite a lavish period drama and on the other hand also quite understated, as its a slow, somewhat plodding watch but it features some lovely scenes of many characters partaking in card games, dances and other leisurely pursuits. On the other hand, there are some battle scenes and soldiers are shown being shot to the ground like flies in a perhaps unnerving way. I liked the use of classical music in the background of many scenes - it felt quite an atmospheric watch overall, although I did get a little bit confused about the precise details of Barry's journeys. While watching it, I felt it was surprisingly engrossing. Its a bit slow but its certainly an enjoyable watch, or so I felt anyway. I liked that there's some soft lighting used and indeed some scenes had the look/feel of a dream almost.I liked the scenes set outside the stately homes, with pretty backdrops as well as the many people in costume making it a quite appealing watch. The plot itself may seem a little bare but there is plenty to interest the viewer regardless. I liked seeing how the young son grew up, for one thing.If your a fan of character based period dramas then I would definitely recommend this film, although it does seem somewhat pompous, it is certainly quite good and I liked that it, if but lightly, mocks nobility."

This is perhaps the lesson that the film will teach you."
