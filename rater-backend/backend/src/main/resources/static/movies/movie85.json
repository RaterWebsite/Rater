On its own, it stands tall thanks to the powerful court scene, its accurate depiction of childhood, and its terrific acting, especially by Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch."

      "text": "To start with, the book is absolutely wonderful with great characters and a moving story. To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the best adaptations of a book, it is not only faithful to the source material but it almost improves on it. Do I have any criticisms? Not really, other than to say that the film is a tad overlong for my liking. But it is a brilliant film, with a beautifully crafted story that still maintains the emotional punch of the book about a lawyer in the Deep South and the effect of the rape trial on his children. The film is beautifully shot, the whole film is incredible to watch, and the score is sensitive. The script is effective and sticks closely to the book, and the direction from Robert Mulligan is very impressive. The acting is really good, I have read that Henry Fonda would have been better for Atticus Finch, although Fonda was a great actor, Gregory Peck does give a superb and career-best performance in this film. And he is very well supported by an excellent Robert Duvall as disturbed Boo Radley, while Mary Badham and Phillip Alford are very well-cast as the children. Overall, a wonderful and faithful adaptation and just an excellent film really. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox"

      "text": "This movie has been made in a high quality but not for today, for its time. we have more progressed & brighter minds in 21st century & we will never see movies, songs or any social platforms implying issues like the one in this film, this way; we've got more insight about it now. So I found it expired, too direct & boring as a consequence."

      "text": "To Kill a Mockingbird (1962) can be considered a true work of art, because in it, you can see excellent photography, good lighting, a very good script and a first casting. I envy those who in 1962 could appreciate this jewel in cinemas, because certainly, it is a film that address different issues, including racism, poverty, justice, morals, transports us to our childhood making us children again in clothes of Jem, Scout and Dill, transporting us to our younger years, and confirming that good triumphs over evil. Undoubtedly, To Kill a Mockingbird (1962), becomes one of my favorite movies."

I enjoyed the court related plot but I was marvelled by the kids' adventures and their interactions with the society surrounding them."
