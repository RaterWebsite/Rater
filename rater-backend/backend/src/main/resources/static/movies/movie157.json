The Russian roulette scene absolutely tore me apart. That scene is potentially the most emotionally powerful scene of cinema I have ever seen. The amazing thing about this movie is that, while not only touching on issues of war and post-war syndrome, this movie shows us classical themes of friendship and brotherhood. I pretty much felt like I had just been punched in the face by a wave of awesomeness when it finished. This is, by far, one of the best movies ever made. Period."

In his most endearing performance ever on scree, Christopher Walken molds Nicky into precisely the desensitized warriror Cimino must have wanted, or at least dream about. The entire supporting cast adds to the movie's sparkle and gleam of greatness. But, it is in it's lack of cohesion, and it's, ultimately, slow pacing. There is a scene that will make your heart explode, but you wont make it to that scene if you have a short attention span."

Of course, the supporting roles are fantastic too - just look at the names: Walken and Streep! I've seen people terrified by the portrayal of war and then teared-up by the impact the war had on the characters. Directing, acting, writing and even cinematography; it uses them all to perfection. It is my 8th favourite movie and will never lose it's incredible impact!\rIf you plan on watching it, please watch past the first hour (many people think it's boring) and I guarantee your enjoyment for the remainder of the movie!"

But The Deer Hunter spends a huge stretch on an overlong wedding scene at the beginning and then gives short shrift to critical dramatic moments. The war elements feel like vague flashbacks, we never see the characters' transformation through the war, just a kind of before and after. Hard video cuts also rob several dramatic moments of their tension. I feel that a good editor could make this film much better."

      "text": "With director Cimino's recent death and his reputation in tatters since the debacle of 'Heaven's Gate', I decided to visit 'The Deer Hunter'. Though over three hours long, it's astonishing, paced so achingly right and I can see why he rightfully earned the 'carte blanche' that would unfortunately lead to his downfall (as well as an entire studio's) as soon as he made his next film. But to reach such heights and to have such ambition--as well as undeniable talent--is a victory in and of itself. Just armed with the main five actors alone, at the zenith of their craft, a fine script (really the first interesting and well-deliberated Vietnam film to hit the big screen) and Vilmos Zsigmond behind the camera meant that this would prove something special. Scenes that will haunt you forever. My favourite shot is the incredible 360-degree pan shot around Linda's bedroom when she realizes she's given up on Nick and is going to declare her love to Michael--extraordinary stuff. What's YOURS?\r Many film lovers who despise Cimino's work instantly clam up when 'The Deer Hunter' is mentioned...and there's a reason for that. It's deservedly considered one of the finest American films of the 70's--a decade that was chock-full of great ones."

      "text": "I confess that I didn't really know what to expect from this film when I started watching it. I knew it was a prestigious film, considered by many to be one of the best films of the 1970s, and I knew the basics about the plot. In the end, I liked what I saw, but it doesn't look as good as a lot of people say it should be and what should be a film that won five Academy Awards (Best Film, Best Director, Best Sound, Best Editing and Best Supporting Actor) and was nominated for four another categories (Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress, Best Cinematography and Best Original Screenplay) in 1979!The script is complex and you should pay attention as each character is introduced. The film focuses on three young Russian-Americans from a rural Pennsylvania community who go to the Vietnam War: Michael is the strongest and most charismatic, Steven is getting married and Nick leaves a girlfriend behind, for whom Michael has a crush. United by friendship, they end up separated by war.Much can be said about the story told in this film, directed by Michael Cimino in the only successful film of his short and obscure career. The first hour cost me a lot: the film takes a long time to start and the introduction is overloaded with dialogues and scenes that could have been cut in the editing room. This part should be shorter, presenting the characters and their environment without bothering the audience too much with details that are irrelevant to the story (such as the details of the wedding and the party). Another problem I felt was seeing the main characters being so immature all the time. For the film to work, they have to win the public's sympathy and not their hatred!After an hour of suffering and looking at the clock, the three boys finally go to Vietnam. And here is another surprise: the Vietnam War never took up so little time in a film about it! I won't be exaggerating if I say that I saw only half an hour of war scenes. I felt that Cimino wanted to quickly go over the war and developing that was not something he wanted to do. But if this is a film about the war and how it affected people it was a major theme and needed to be developed further! We only saw one attack! Was that damn marriage more important?From that moment on the film improves substantially, with the development of a dramatic story around the fate of each of the characters. I have only two objections to make: I am able to understand the symbolism of the Russian roulette, and that Cimino had the idea of betting on it as a kind of\u2026 leitmotiv for his film. I understand that. But a question of logic and credibility arises: Michael plays the game about seven to ten times, not counting all the games that Nick will have played... unless he cheats in some way, it's impossible to stay alive so much time. Oh\u2026 and that ending, with the whole cast singing \u201cGod Bless America\u201d, seems so absurd that it's even cynical.Let's talk about the cast\u2026 and we have a cast full of heavyweights. Robert De Niro offers us an exceptionally restrained performance, but still full of charisma and intensity at the right time; Christopher Walken leaves us the best work of his career, which isn't to say little considering his longevity and the regularity of his work; John Cazale and his wife, the young Meryl Streep, are also in this film, which was the farewell of Cazale, famous for his part in \u201cThe Godfather\u201d trilogy, and who entered this film very weakened by the cancer who victimized him, days after filming was ended.Technically, it's a film with ups and downs. We have an excellent cinematography which knows how to make good use of light and shadow, create an environment and sensations in the public; the sets and costumes were very well-made and thought to detail, with special attention to the wedding and the jungle scenes. The choice of landscapes and filming locations was satisfactory but not always accurate, considering that Pennsylvania was portrayed and shown in a way that is more like Colorado. The editing is miserable and I remember that the film won the Oscar in that category, which is at least surreal and says a lot about the choices of the Academy. The sound effects are decent but the sound quality is below what we could expect. Much better is the soundtrack, especially the cavatina composed for this film by Stanley Myers."

      "text": "My expectations were high. I had heard so much about this film - THE defining Vietnam film. Gritty, unnerving, fearless and provocative, and with a wide scope that broached all the mores of the times...What a load of guff. I'm serious. Perhaps when the film was released in 1978 it was such a great achievement to even attempt a film about Vietnam that it got a by on artistic merit. Here's the lowdown (no spoliers):    *An incredibly long wedding scene that has no particular bearing on the plot (including the memorable line \"f**k it\" which nicely defines the movie).    *Lot's of irrelevant hunting scenes (is killing a stag like... killing a man? Am /I/ the stag?).    *A combat scene in Vietnam that lasts 20 seconds (when we had to sit through the wedding scene for a half hour).    *A lot of repetition of the Vietnamese word 'Mao' (and slapping)    *An unrealistic firefight.    *Survivor guilt    *Lots more survivor guilt    *A bit of amnesia and one of the characters who couldn't get enough of the Vietnamese word 'Mao' in the first place.   It   might seem unfair to sum up a movie like this - but the fact that the movie believes its irrelevance is portentous makes it merely pretentious. Besides some very good acting from De Nero and co. the film in reality has very little to say apart from the overarching theme of \"f**k it\". It does not look at America in any real way, and certainly makes a determined effort to not look at all at Vietnam. It comes in at the very tail end of the Vietnam conflict, makes some overarching gesture saying: well war makes you go mad, and then stands back at a distance marveling at the tragedy of it all.    If you are going to have irrational characters, at least give their irrationality due cause.    If you are going to make a film, hire an editor at some stage.    If you are going to write a story about war, attempt to the utmost of your ability  to feature that war.    If you are going to make a film about deer-hunting, make a film about hunting deer. Do not give it an hour of screen time just to facilitate some tenuous symbolic meaning."

      "text": "Because the Russian roulette image is even on the poster, verisimilitude has to be a major consideration -- even more important than the film's basic entertainment value. Near as I can tell from shallow research, there is no credible record of the Vietnamese cruelly forcing American POWs to play Russian roulette for fun and profit.  That kind of made-up accusation in a movie made for popular release is just propaganda plain and tall. And it was used as propaganda by others to beat the war drum for Vietnam, though Cimino swears he never had a clue as this outcome. You might enjoy a movie that has big scenes showing French resistant fighters killing Nazis with a guillotine, or one featuring Napoleon's soldiers squeezing Austrians through a laundry wringer, but when the big scene is just made up, perhaps out of ignorance, the film can't be considered good.It's pointless to claim that the Russian roulette bits were not intended as criticism of the Vietnamese soldiers or that the portrayal of NVAs as grinning fiends was unintentional: That's what is on the film that millions of people saw.  And, sadly, millions of American believed it -- still do.Look, Leni Riefenstahl was at first praised in Hollywood for her Nazi propaganda films.  And there may be some cinematic merit in them.  But you'd have to at least share some of her sympathies to arrive at the opinion that her 'Victory of Faith' was worth four stars."

      "text": "I am astounded at how a film can be so long yet only have about half an hour's worth of actual professionally directed content. The first hour is completely pointless and bares no relation to the next half an hour. The characters are poorly developed and have no real personality. The film starts with an hour-long (seemingly) unedited wedding video. Then some guy shoots a deer. Then it immediately jumps into a Vietnamese battlefield, with no explanation whatsoever or anything to make a link between the most boring hour in the history of movies and the next half an hour. Even the bit which actually has some action can pretty much be summarised by a one minute cutscene in the game Call of Duty: Black Ops. So the only bit that's actually exciting or eventful in this film features half an hour of Russian Roulette. That's it. So my advice: if you want to watch this film, just find a 20 minute clip of it and there's the entire film for you. There's no story behind it at all."

      "text": "Its running length may annoy some, and it's criticized for being self-indulgent, and for having a problematic message. And while I can see that it could have been more shorter, I think that it has this great emotional impact because Cimino took his time in a very long first act that made us dive into the characters, and most importantly, their relationship. This first act with all its very very long scenes that feel as they were unedited is what made us care deeply about his characters when they were thrown inside a terrifically tense, gut-wrenching second act. That's how Cimino made us thoroughly disturbed, and have mixed, and vague feelings that result in creating a great catharsis at the third act. Every actor gave a very realistic performance, needless to say that both De Niro and Meryl Streep shine, but Christopher Walken's Oscar-winning performance is the standout here. All the characters are fully-developed, and fleshed out, but they are incredibly realistic and three-dimensional that can be analyzed as they are Shakespearean or Tolstoyan characters.I can't believe or describe how emotionally sweeping and overwhelming this epic is.(9/10)"

      "text": "The Deer Hunter truly lives up to the hype and more for me. Absolutely brilliant film. Entirely sombering and one of the most emotionally distressing films I have ever seen. I honestly feel as though I may have PTSD after watching this one, it was just that emotionally powerful and resonant. Many claim that this one is a little slow and overlong, but I never saw that honestly. One of the main points of criticism is the wedding sequence, but if you cannot tell that the joy and happiness in that sequence is meant to directly juxtapose the sadness and emotional turmoil of the rest of the film, I am honestly sad for you, because that is one of the most brilliant pieces of this one. An entirely beautiful sequence, I could honestly watch the wedding for the entire three hours, because at least I would not leave this one feeling emotionally defeated. The Russian Roulette elements, and the characters' transformations from the first one to the final one, are immaculately filmed and just so impactful throughout. The direction from Michael Cimino is truly remarkable, as is the acting from the two true stars here; Christopher Walken and Meryl Streep. Walken steals the show throughout, but Streep's emotionally vulnerable performance (especially considering what was happening in her personal life with John Cazale at the time) is heartbreakingly beautiful and stands tall as one of the best performances in a film littered with them. Finally, the final half hour is pitch perfect filmmaking and, while entirely distressing, just so mesmerizingly perfect you cannot look away. However, in spite of all this, it is a touch long and in terms of war films, I do think Downfall and Saving Private Ryan are superior, though I would rank this one over other Vietnam films such as Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket. As a whole, The Deer Hunter is not for everyone, but I can entirely see why it is a classic and, to me, it deserves to be 100%."

Perhaps it was done to subtly define details in some of the characters and the relationships with each other, which I would concede it does, but feel there might have been some less lengthy ways to accomplish this.\r I do not see The Deer Hunter as a \"Vietnam War\" film per se. So many either expect or want it to be just that, and therefore fault it for failing to \"define\" that war historically, politically or morally, and for not having a high level of historically factual accuracy. Those who want to see films about that would be better served by We Were Soldiers, Platoon, and Full Metal Jacket (these three have some flaws; take them in aggregation). I believe Deer Hunter is more a broader commentary about war in general and what it does to those directly or indirectly affected by it, either by having been in combat or in close relationships with those who were. The Vietnam War was the immediate societal and cultural experience of the time to use as a vehicle for it, and a number of aspects of the film are metaphorical. I do believe it captures with some insight, the (heavy) industrial, blue collar small towns in middle America that are much more heavily laced with provincialism and blindly unquestioning \"zealous patriotism\" compared to the more critical, cosmopolitan attitudes found in major metropolitan regions (patriotism without the zealotry).\r The most poignant of the metaphors are the deer hunting and the controversial Russian roulette. I don't believe the latter was ever intended to be historically accurate. It is an extremely powerful means to carry self-destructive aspects of PTSD and \"survivor guilt\" in particular with the seeming randomness of death in warfare, not knowing if one will survive from one moment to the next at times with each combat action being yet another round of Russian roulette. Instead of watching the film expecting it to portray \"what\" happened in Vietnam, view it from a perspective of how war indelibly changes those who were drawn into it, and their relationships with others as participants, family and close friends. As one of those who is part of the Vietnam War generation and served quite a few years in the army, I saw it when originally released. It was unsettling and took me a few days to realize this is what the film is about. Each viewing since then, including very recently, has confirmed it."

A refreshing change from the usual Hollywood propaganda, this film makes a good point about the inanity of war in as much that the main characters are Russian descendants that end up fighting for American interests in Vietnam during the Cold War. The tone is sarcastic, and mood is sombre with a theme tune by Stanley Myers that does it justice. Good acting from Meryl Streep along with the main cast.

It is a long way from a bad film, in fact it's good and often very impressive, but it's also uneven in places.'The Deer Hunter' is by some way director Michael Cimino's best film, and it contains his best ever directing. That's saying a good deal, considering that only a few years later he would go on to direct the notorious flop 'Heaven's Gate' and his career never really recovered. 'The Deer Hunter' is considered by some one of the finest Vietnam films (don't quite agree, to me there are far better examples), but it is also perhaps the most controversial. Either viewpoint is very easy to understand.Despite its many impressive, outstanding even, elements, 'The Deer Hunter' is uneven. It is a bit too long (and no before anybody sneers, there have been films of similar length and even longer that still manage to be great films, a few among the best ever made), and would have been solved by tighter editing and a little less time on the lengthy wedding sequence, which is compelling with some strong character development but could easily have been trimmed.Parts are disjointed too, with some abrupt scene shifts and a heavy-handed patriotic ending that felt incredibly tacky against the rest of the film. There are deficiencies in the sound quality on top of all this.On the other hand, editing aside, 'The Deer Hunter' is an exceptionally well made film. The cinematography is quite magnificent and the attention to detail in the settings and the rest of the production both sumptuous and rich in atmosphere, the authenticity also remarkable. The music haunts the mind and is very beautiful, the mournful guitar theme unforgettable.Cimino is at his best in the director's chair, while the script provokes thought and the story is often incredibly powerful and moving. The highlight is the justly acclaimed Russian Roulette sequence, which today is genuinely harrowing and will stay with you forever.Robert De Niro has seldom been more restrained and gives an affecting performance. Even better is Christopher Walken, who has never reduced me to tears before and he really wrenches the heart here, making his character a compellingly real one and the most relatable one. John Savage, John Cazale (in his last film before his ultimely death) and a young Meryl Streep are sterling in support.In summary, uneven film but often very impressive with much to admire. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

After research, the type of situation encountered in Vietnam is not historically documented as being realistic, but it's one of the most iconic cinematic scenes ever and the acting will bring you there, regardless of historical accuracy.  Probably not the flick to watch if you're feeling down, but I don't expect to watch many films that are better than this in my lifetime."

      "text": "\"The Deer Hunter\" is full of powerhouse performances, foremost among them Christopher Walken and Robert De Niro's war vets, and its Vietnam scenes are extremely intense and harrowing. BUT, the film is pushing three hours, and its plot doesn't support its runtime. It isn't some Apocalypse Now-style war epic - it's a very personal and psychological drama. Because of this, we're not jumping from set-piece to set-piece, but rather watching a collection of well-acted and simultaneously profoundly uninteresting characters meander about doing nothing-in-particular for several hours. The set-pieces it does have - the very long wedding sequence at the beginning, and the Vietnam segment that makes up the middle of the film as examples - are hit-and-miss. The wedding scene runs far too long, while the Vietnam segment is the highlight of the film, but nevertheless it is book-ended either side with the tedious \"drama\" of boring people being very quiet around one another.The film does manage to be quite compelling up until Robert De Niro's protagonist returns home, perhaps two thirds of the way through the movie. The climactic game of Russian Roulette between Walken's and De Niro's characters is similarly very compelling. The problem is that what bridges this gap is an hour of pure monotony, with Meryl Streep's character doing so little in the film that her inclusion feels meaningless. That's the worst part of the film - you feel as though you've watched a really top-notch war drama and are about prepared to go, but then you realize, oh wait, there's still another hour to go. And that's the crime of this film. It's not in the performances, or in the direction really, or even in the story - the performances are deserving of the highest praise, the film is well, if coldly, directed, and the plot is sound, with parts of it very compelling. The problem is that this story does not support a three-hour epic, and so its runtime is enormously bloated, leaving the film a deeply personal psychological war drama masquerading as a very boring epic."

      "text": "I can understand why this is regarded as a film classic - the 'Russian Roulette' scenes may well stay with me for some time. There are some sobering and even poignant moments present but I'd say its more of a symbolic film, than an out right action drama type of a film. The best performances, in my opinion of course, were by Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken. Its a film of two halves - the pre-'nam half and the other half post 'nam. Its bleak when you think about it towards the end, although I did find myself being a little surprised at the end, as I'd somehow expected there to have been more in the way of disturbing, bloody imagery. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad there wasn't as I don't much like that sort of thing but I suppose I had it in my head that this was going to be a very tough watch and I didn't entirely find it so - the previously mentioned roulette scenes do make for edgy viewing but I must have expected more somehow. The ending is pretty thoughtful and indeed it is somewhat thought provoking. Its really all about the toll that involvement in war (any war) can have on people - particularly, of course, a group of youngish, seemingly previously care free, people.Its a film of its time and it makes for relatively thoughtful viewing. Thats about all I can think to say about it really. Yes, I suppose I would recommend it, although it may not be as visually shocking as you may expect - films these days are a lot more explicit but this film still contains important themes."

      "text": "As of writing this review, I believe this is the greatest film of all time. Michael Ciminos direction is well paced and he brings out the best in his three leads. This movie is important, it has something to say, and it is all executed perfectly. If you have three hours to spare, spend them watching The Deer Hunter. You will not regret it."
