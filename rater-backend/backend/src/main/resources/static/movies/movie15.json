How is it a classic? It is one of the best movies I ever watched but why is it so revered? I watched it another time just to keep my eye out for details.Now I understand.It isn't easy. Especially to praise a film with countless violence and seemingly aimless profanity (300 f words total). But Goodfellas isn't about that. It's about the story. It's about the array of characters. It's about the suspense. It's one of the most accurate portraits of mob life, specifically those in the lower end of the food chain.THe story is narrated by Henry Hill, an ex-mobster who explains his dreams of becoming a gangster. Through Henry's eyes, being a gangster was everything. Money. Cars. Girls. Respect. Nobody would dare talk rough to a gangster. And the cops could care less too. Our main man Henry, narrates his 30-year career as a mob member from parking cars to setting cars on fire to dealing drugs to carrying out dastardly schemes (the infamous Lufthansa heist). In the end, Henry is forced to give up his mob life and expose his fellow gangsters after learning his best friend is going to kill him. Even then, he still misses his old life stating that he is now a regular guy aka a nobody, a \"schnook\".Robert De Niro is charming yet cunning as Jimmy Conway. He smiles but behind is a greedy desire. He makes sure he gets what he wants and those who don't follow him get whacked. Joe Pesci, the show stealer, gives a fiery performance as the short-tempered Tommy De Vito. He wants respect and one word is enough to make him go berserk. Ray Liotta and Lorraine Bracco both give fine performances even though they are the most thankless roles in the film.Dialogue is a highlight even if it is laced with numerous profanity. But the music is something that really adds to the success. The eclectic rock soundtrack fits its scenes like a modern-day orchestra. Scorsese is able to fit a piano version of Layla and a montage of dead bodies so perfectly. That is a rare gift.Once again my favorite director stuns me with another classic that I now fully realize as a classic. It may not be his best (that would be Taxi Driver) but it definitely is one of them."

Como \u00e9 de costume nas suas obras, o realismo aqui atingido \u00e9 assustador em alguns momentos. O anti-romantismo aqui funciona bem. Fica bem claro que os personagens s\u00e3o psic\u00f3ticos e corrompidos, e se voc\u00ea se deixa influenciar por eles, o problema est\u00e1 na sua cabe\u00e7a.A paranoia e a realidade luxuosa, \"privilegiada\", crua e imprevis\u00edvel \u00e9 muito bem retratada aqui. Isso nos deixa nervosos, pois sabemos que qualquer coisa pode acontecer, e a ci\u00eancia do protagonista n\u00e3o melhora muito as coisas, afinal ele n\u00e3o est\u00e1 no controle.Foi muito interessante ver a atua\u00e7\u00e3o explosiva e psic\u00f3tica do Joe Pesci ap\u00f3s assisti-lo em \"O Irland\u00eas\", onde ele ocupa um papel bem diferente na mafia. Posso dizer o mesmo de Robert De Niro, que nesse filme da vida a uma pessoa mais temperamental, se comparada ao seu pape no filme aqui j\u00e1 mencionado. Lorraine Bracco estava excelente, e me fez sentir raiva da personagem dela as vezes, de t\u00e3o  bem que ela interpretava nos momentos de puro del\u00edrio.Goodfellas \u00e9 um filme essencial para quem \u00e9 fan do g\u00eanero e se considera um cin\u00e9filo. Al\u00e9m do enredo, o casting \u00e9 lend\u00e1rio e a dire\u00e7\u00e3o do Scorsese sempre \u00e9 uma maravilha de se apreciar."

      "text": "Martin Scorsese, like many of his compositions, is very shrewd in his good comrades, and in a narrative that is carefully constructed and avoids us as an audience.Goodfellas is a better and more thoughtful version of his previous film Mean Streets, especially since Goodfellas takes us on a journey to find out who is telling us the story in the film. Reflect on whose words we listen to and tend to accept. This is an important question in the context of a film that asks us to consider gangsters as notable human beings. Henry Hill, the narrator and the main character of the film, seems to be in the role of our guide.He talks to us throughout the film (using Voice Over) and what we see as the viewer is actually what he sees and the story seems to be controlled by him as the main character. As Scorsese constantly questions the fact whether humans have control over things or it is the circumstances and the story that happen to humans. This is one of the recurring themes and an important part of the main structure in this good director's films. The use of a omniscient (narrator) who is also the main character of the film in each of the films has made the viewer feel inside the story."

Not one person in the movie stood out as a particularly bad actor. Ray Liotta's first person narration works really well and helps us get to know the character all that much better. The story kept me interested the whole way through, showing us Henry Hill's life and how cutthroat and dangerous the mob can really be. This may very well be the first movie I have ever seen that made me want to watch it again IMMEDIATELY after watching it!"

Directed by Martin Scorsese, it has a Nicholas Pileggi script and a cast headed by Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci. The film was nominated for six Oscars, winning only one of them (Best Supporting Actor).This is a cult film for lovers of gangster movies. Based on real events, the film shows us a lot about the inner world of the Mafia and can transport the audience into the world of organized crime with great ease. It has an excellent script, which focuses its attention on the brutality of the men, and the superficiality of appearance of lives that crime allowed them to bear. All the actors were at the highest level but Joe Pesci exceeded expectations giving his character the soul of a true psychopath, with very strong action scenes. In fact, all the action scenes in this movie are intense, but they are even better for never losing realism and do not seem too far-fetched. De Niro achieved in this film, one of the most careful and well-achieved interpretations of his entire career to date. Much of the film's success is due to the painstaking efforts of Scorcese, a committed director who likes to make exceptionally good films. The photography is excellent, quite dark at times, which helps to capture the most tense moments of the film. All visual effects and sound were made carefully and look good on the screen."
