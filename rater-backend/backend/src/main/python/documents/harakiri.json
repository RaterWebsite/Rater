      "rating": "10",
      "text": "Despite their profound idealization of honor when it comes to the samurai, in one way or another, it is something that makes them so fascinating, and Harakiri clearly addresses the ethics of what their code entails.Harakiri is an elegant, powerful, emotional, dramatic, exciting and beautiful movie. A masterpiece that exudes quality in all its elements.I can now see why this is one of the best samurai movies ever made, and it's all the more surprising that it's one that rightly questions its system."
