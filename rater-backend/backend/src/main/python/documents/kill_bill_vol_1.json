I personally love it and all its stylistic changes, switching back and forth from a spaghetti western to a samurai revenge film in the matter of minutes. The violence is terrific and most of the time completely hilarious, and the storytelling is brilliant throughout."

      "text": "With Kill Bill, Quentin Tarantino continues to do what he does best - elevating supposedly \"trashy\" film genres to credible cinematic fare. Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is packed full of energy and style, with Tarantino's trademark extreme violence and eloquent, machine-gun dialogue. It also has a plethora of film references for cinephiles, mostly from Spaghetti Westerns, Hong Kong martial arts and Samurai films. Tarantino is not afraid to affectionately poke a little fun at the films he is paying homage to, but he never takes it to the extent of parody. Before this film, I'd have never in a million years pictured Uma Thurman as an action heroine, but thankfully Tarantino saw her potential in this role - she is great as the vengeful Bride. It is Lucy Liu and particularly Daryl Hannah who really steal the show performance-wise however, with Liu playing O-Ren Ishii, an honourable assassin-turned-mob leader, and Hannah playing Elle Driver, a considerably less honourable, and far more malicious former assassin. The action is superb, the fight scenes creative, well-choreographed and bloody, notably The Bride's brutal fight with Ishii's schoolgirl bodyguard Gogo (a particularly menacing Chiaki Kuriyama) and the following rather serene and beautiful duel with Ishii herself. Unfortunately, the sequence that links these two truly exceptional one-on-ones, involving The Bride hacking her way through wave after wave of henchmen, is more than a little overblown and excessive - the first dismembered limb and fountain of blood is shocking, but a long succession of the same gets a bit dull. My favourite scene of the whole film was an unexpected Japanese Anime segment that explores O-Ren Ishii's origins, and is an emotionally charged refreshing change of pace from the rest of the film. The first volume of Kill Bill is not only a fine example of a revenge movie that effectively adopts the stylistic conventions of numerous other genres, but it's a brilliant example of exciting film storytelling on its own terms to boot. The extent of Quentin Tarantino's film knowledge is still staggering, and he remains a true auteur gifted in all aspects of filmmaking, from cinematography and editing to screenwriting and selecting tracks for the film's eclectic and brilliant soundtrack. Other than a slightly monotonous grisly extended fight scene, I have incredibly little about Kill Bill Volume 1 to criticise - it's a brilliant, blood-splattered love-letter to the less artistically admired, but no less cinematically important filmmakers, and perfectly sets you up for the stunning conclusion to The Bride's quest for revenge in Vol. 2."

But in regards to the bride, she sets off by making a list of those who portrayed her, and its clear from the beginning that this film was always going to be building to something bigger, does it take anything away from the film? Perhaps a little, it certainly stands on its own two feet, but the fact remains that we are introduced to these various characters but only get a handful of them. Saying that, however, the scenes with these particular members of the Deadly Viper group are fantastically gory, anime and exaggerated tone that only Tarantino is capable of pulling off with such gritty means.\rUma Thurman\u2019s \u2018Bride\u2019 is typically cold and in a particular mindset for the film, she delivers her kills with little mercy, perfectly portrayed by Thurman herself, who shows her willingness to throw herself into any role, a junkie in Pulp Fiction and now a deadly assassin.\rThe final moments of the film, and the build up are quite remarkable. Tarantino utilises his devices including typical Japanese slashers and even Spagetti Westerns to culminate in a massively colourful fight scene, but the final confrontation between the Bride and O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu is a beautifully crafted scene, and a true powerhouse in filmmaking.\rFor what it lacks in finalising a story, Kill Bill Vol. 1 certainly makes up for in its unique ability to combine visually striking scenes of blood splattered marvel, and Tarantino is truly at his best."

      "text": "Kill Bill Vol. 1, is a great movie! A movie about a mother looking for revenge on some guy and a couple of assassins. The story seems pretty bare bones, but I really like it. Cause on the surface it just seems like a revenge story for Uma Thurman's character. But it expands upon her journey hunting down these assassins in so many ways. Some of the assassins even get backstories. More in volume 2, but the Japanese assassin gets a beautifully animated backstory which perfectly everything we need to know about the character. One thing I love about the movie is the beautiful soundtrack, especially in the China portion of the film. The soundtrack sounds like it was composed by Nobuo Uematsu himself. It's magnificent. The acting is also good too. Uma Thurman absolutely nails her character as (like I said earlier) a mother trying to get revenge. She has the caring, charming mentality of a mother. But the cold blooded, bad ass nature of an assassin. everyone else is good too, but you don't really see much of any other characters. The characters get a lot more fleshed out in volume 2. But my absolute favorite film about this film, is the fights, and the fight choreography. It is **** brutal. Every single fight scene is fun to watch. Every time there was a fight I had a **** eating grin on my face. Hell! This movie opens on a fight, and its amazing. In the fights Uma Thurman will be doing 20 flips, spinning on the floor, swinging her sword around in loops like a god damn industrial fan. I absolutely love the fights. The scene in Tokyo where \"The Bride\" has to fight the Crazy 88 is splendid, just a magnificent scene. I love how the filter cuts to black and white, like its an old Japanese karate movie. I just love it. I honestly just really like Kill Bill Vol.1 and Vol.2 for completely different reasons. This movie for the breathtaking fight scenes, and Volume 2 for its brilliant dialogue. Kill Bill Volume 1 & 2 are some of Tarantino's best. Okay. Just go watch them ya **** idiot. They're really good. They make my dick rock hard! 9 outta 10."

Brilliant, timeless classic, which is exactly what to expect from Quentin. Vol 1 and 2 are one of those kind of movies that I have to watch every time I see it on cable. It just never gets old."

After The Bride, Uma Thurman, was betrayed by her boss, Bill, she is slapped in to a coma and left to wonder what happened to her baby. With an interesting story to complement beautiful violence, Kill Bill Vol. 1 is a true masterpiece."

Quentin Tarantino does an amazing job with his non-linear structure making the films more entertaining and offering backstories for his characters.

I never understood why some people dislike this film... Performances, cinematography, choreography of the fights, action sequences, dialogue, music... all perfect! It even contains a manga anime sequence on it which I found very artistic. Also, I loved splatter and camera tricks. It is very impressive and the plot is really interesting and touching at some point. Last but not least, I can say Uma Thurman totally rocked on there! Her best role out of her career without a doubt! Lucy Liu was also very good as the main villain. My favorite scene was Uma Thurman vs Lucy Liu fight. Really breathtaking! Overall, a flawless perfect film that really deserves its good ratings and critics. It becomes even better along with Vol. 2 because it focuses more on the story and characters, but Vol. 2 is not as strong and badass as this one."

The story, like Pulp Fiction, is as minimal as possible; only existing to explain the motives behind all the violence. Uma Thurman looks stunning in this film, and the combat scenes are not only directed with style and perfection, but they're also quite comical at points. It's almost like a Jackie Chan cartoon only with sharp-edged weapons and a lot of uncensored violence. In fact, the amount of blood and gore can seem a bit too much given the cartoony style of the film. But the scenes are top notch. Quentin Tarantino sure knows how to direct action scenes well. The only criticism I have is that there's no real story, so you're just watching a compilation of action scenes rather than a movie experience."

A stylized revenge flick is what it is, so to take it as more than that is ludicrous, and for what it is it is nearly perfect. I do not believe Tarantino intended to create the greatest film of all time, I believe that he intended to create an entertaining movie that combines his favorite genres, and it works. The acting, the screenplay, the direction, and the countless homages to kung fu, spaghetti western, and exploitation movies make it a massively entertaining watch."

      "text": "Quentin Tarantino, a formidable filmmaker in Hollywood, who has masterminded great pictures like RESERVOIR DOGS and PULP FICTION, is also hugely responsible for the greatness behind KILL BILL: VOLUME 1 (KB1). KILL BILL was at first being scheduled for a single movie, but that single movie exceeds a running time of over four hours. The decision to separate the source into two parts was favourable  KB1 was released in late 2003 while its sequel, KB2, was released in early 2004.\r To me, KB1 is a cinematic masterpiece. Everything in the movie was being meticulously orchestrated, right from the start of the movie to the end of it. I would say the movie is just tight. You would wish to imagine a tight, ripped body of a person, that's KB1. Editing of this movie is just sharp and great writing too. An element which caught my attention is the camera work itself  I would say they are highly artistic and imaginative. In one particular scene, Tarantino exploited a long impeccable tracking shot with no cuts, and it is brilliant.\r Beyond the near-perfect cinematic experience which Tarantino has given us, Uma Thurman's performance deserved a praise too. She manipulated her character extremely well which I think it is being overlooked, her performance is decent. Her character in the film is boiling with sadness and anger and for example, in one scene, you could witness that pain or anger through Thurman's expression on her face  that marks the work of a great actress.\r As a whole, this movie is daringly beautiful. The plot is simple, but Tarantino's clever navigation for this movie is excellent. Could I say it? Kill Bill Vol 1 is bloody, darkly comical, and unforgettable.\r [4.5/5]\r Facebook (http://facebook.com/alex.desmall) Twitter (@Alex_DeSmall) (http://www.rottentomatoes.com/member/AlexDesmall)"
