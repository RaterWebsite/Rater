      "text": "The Grapes of Wrath is a classic film that stands out as one of the American greats. Not only does it hold up today, but it stands out as one of the best adaptations of a novel I have ever seen. The stunning visuals really help sell the sense of hopelessness that pervades The Great Depression. The performances are fantastic and the ensemble cast really bares their souls and shares their pains, their hopes, their dreams, and their inevitable defeat. This is a must see movie for film buffs."
