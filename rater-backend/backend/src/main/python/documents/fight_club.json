      "text": "Nearly everyone knows the rules, number one of which I\u2019m about to break.\r What do you do if you\u2019re sick of your boring, pathetic life? In the most cathartic, DIY approach possible, Fight Club answers this question: you change it. The absolute prototype of an existential thriller, it wouldn\u2019t be taking too much of a leap to suggest that Fight Club is one of the best films ever made.\r Jim Uhls\u2019 excellently adapted screenplay of Chuck Palahniuk\u2019s novel (this is the only major work by Uhls that I can find), this thriller has been exciting male audiences the world over since its release in 1999. Even Palahniuk himself said the film was amazing. In fact, he admitted that film was so good, the book in comparison made him feel ashamed.\r A nameless, pitiful, seemingly friend and family-less Office worker (Edward Norton) suffers from insomnia. True to Palahniuk\u2019s style, the solution to the insomnia comes in a bizarre way. He finds relief by attending support groups for diseases, diseases he doesn\u2019t have; these people really listen to him, and afterwards, he sleeps. At these meetings he meets Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Character), a nemesis and lover, and it is through her that Mr. Office worker discovers his true self, but not until after he\u2019s transformed more than just his own life.\r Mr. Pitiful Office worker meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). Durden helps Mr. Pitiful Office worker admit to his misery once and for all. Channeling their suppressed male aggression in its rawest form, they start fighting each other. Soon Mr. Pitiful Office worker realizes that he and Durden are not alone.\r Men, downtrodden, tired of their insignificance as worthless individuals all aim to do something greater. They jump at the chance to vent their primal steam, and the solo fights turn into group fights.\r Durden\u2019s vision eventually transcends aggression in its physical form and becomes something much greater, a community where the individual ceases to exist. As part of this whole, every unnamed member is an equal and significant contributor, and it is through the whole that the individual finds meaning. As part of the whole they are changing the future together.\r This movie is a directing marvel. With time shifts, psychological manipulations, and very meticulous scene planning, we are kept on the edge of our seats for the entire film. Accompanied by the pounding soundtrack composed by the Dust Brothers, Fincher achieves the rarity of making a movie better than a book. Fincher turns the concrete basement of Lou\u2019s Tavern into perhaps the most famous arena in all of modern film. The house on Paper Street, a lone abandoned mansion, becomes a factory of redefinition, of reinvention. In the final scene an amazing mesh between the visuals and the music, The Pixies\u2019 \u201cWhere is my Mind,\u201d Fincher creates one of the most stunning combinations of sight and sound in all of film. And it's a pretty damn good ending to the plot too.\r The most memorable scene is when Durden is behind the wheel of a car full of passengers. He buckles up, pins the gas, and lets go of the wheel. The car veers off the road and crashes, flipping multiple times. We are force fed the hard truth here. The Fight Club mantra: to change to our lives we need to rid ourselves of our past failures, forget the job, the kids, the car, the living room, the flat screen HDTV, and just let go.\r You are not your f'cking khakis."

The movie is quite shocking and brutal, but what is most shocking are the negative reviews on it. I have over-viewed lots of these bad reviews and all they talk about is how much violence is in it, and judge little to nothing on the story and/or film quality. Needless to say i shall ignore those reviews due to their plain ignorant critics. Anyways, The story captures you quickly and is very fun to watch. The characters are interesting and fun, the shots are great, the plot is captivating, to sum it all up what isn't their to like about this movie."

Brad Pitt shows the most epic way for rolling the mean paper of the movie. For different kinds of reasons, Edward Norton\u00b4s actuation was one of the best I\u00b4ve seen ever, so so so so great,\r Fight club is special making people think about their lives.

Before this movie, I couldn\u00b4t guess that a girl can act so good, obviously talking about Helena Bonham Carter.\r In some words, the movie is, in my opinion, unique, epic, special, mind-blowing, astonishing, and necessary to see before rest in peace."

The storylines are correct although do feature some changes, the writing is exceptionally fine. The tone of the book has been grasped by writing staff exquisitely though there is little focus on one of the roots of the main character's overall issue: the abscence of a certain family member (the book covered that part more sufficiently). All in all, this movie gave me a new look at my life and my place in it being a rather complex visualization of the book written by Chuck Palahniuk. The soundtrack is worth to be praised on its own: I have listened to it many times while doing homework (not the one depicted in the film) and thinking about life. That's all I have to say for my other feelings for that movie (and the book combined) can't be transferred into words. Watch it."

      "text": "This one of my all-time favorite audiovisual experiences, not only movies, and I love this movie with all of my heart. Everything is just SO GOOD! The direction is of the world, being able to not let attent viewers confused, not revealing anything until the end of the movie but letting some hints before the reveal at the end so we can feel like we have been fooled even when the clues were right on our faces all along. The acting is amazing! Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter excel at showing off their unique characters, which are all oozing with personality. The soundtrack is amazing, the tone is consistent during the whole movie, and the pacing is really good. But now let's talk about the movie's best attribute, the story. HOLY. F*@KING. SH%T. It was one of the smartest things I ever saw in a movie, and if you stop to analyze it is pretty simple, a guy with two personalities has its life changed when one of the personalities start to influence him and it creates a whole army to accomplish a revolutionary goal, the key that made the story work is the way that we are told about the things, we see everything through the eyes of the unnamed narrator (which I will refer as Jack), so we never understand some things because, like him, we are unaware that Tyler Durden is, in fact, another personality he created without knowing it, which is another masterful idea, the fact that Jack is unaware that Tyler Durden is not a real person, which makes sense considering that he would more likely be influenced by someone who is not just another version of himself but a brand new human being. Like I said previously, how we are told the stuff that happens is what makes the story so great if we know from the beginning about Tyler's plan, he would be way less shocked when he discovered about it, the same can be said about Tyler reveal as not being real, if the hints were not so subtle we would have all figured it all before Jack and this would have ruined the shock completely, there is also the idea of 'toxic masculinity' around this movie, and the more I thought about it, the more it made sense, of course, Jack idea of a 'manly man' would be someone as confident, violent and careless as Tyler, it just works so well I am honestly shocked. Overall, this movie is fantastic, I would rewatch it all the time if I could. 10/10 Masterpiece."

      "text": "Fight club is a very interesting film to talk about, seeing in how it talks about such a hot subject and has lots of messages and meanings. I will try however to try and simplify as much as I can. Fight club is about an insomniac who meets this guy who then gets him to form a fight club. From that it sounds pretty simple, but in actuality it's a bit more complex. He starts joining therapy sessions merely for the thrill, I know it's strange right? But apparently the thrill is that he can finally try and show some emotions. I guess that this is here to later show up in the film, like how they talk about his life is meaningless and he only goes along with curve to get by. A lot like the catcher in the Rye. Once we are introduced to Tyler Durden the film starts to become much more interesting, and I think that's a good joke as well. Brad Pitt does a great job of being this leader of anarchy, he's charismatic, and has the right attitude to approaching people to join his cause. Edward Norton however is uninteresting, but that's the point, and I guess that's a pass in my book. One of the most famous parts of this movie figuring out who Tyler Durden really is, and when you find know it makes everything you just scene even more weird. Also the themes it tries to convey are bit too complicated or not that well thought out. I really do like this film, and I think it is a very good movie, but I think again that it may be saying a bit too much or not making sense."

      "text": "This is one of those movies that promises a lot less than it offers, making it a pleasant surprise. Personally, I had low expectations when I saw this movie, but in fact I had read virtually nothing about it before I saw it.The ingenious script is based on the strange and somewhat masochistic friendship between two very different men. One is very shy and the other very rebellious and iconoclastic. Both create a discreet, strict-rule fight club that evolves into a sort of secret society of anarchist contours. The story has a lot of twists and turns, surprising us, catching our attention. However, its not a perfect movie and there are really logical gaps and credibility issues in the story, not to mention that, at some point, the audience no longer really knows what is true in everything they saw. I believe this is intentional, and I recognize that its a feature that has its charm, but it may disappoint some people (personally I dealt with it reasonably well).A decidedly good point in this movie is the gigantic performances of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton. Both are great actors, when they have space and material to evolve, and that's what happened here. Both actors were brilliant and developed throughout the film a bizarrely perfect partnership, with a touch of sadism, repressed homosexuality and predatory instinct. David Fincher, the director, also deserves congratulations, as he's the hand that guides everything and manages, with this film, to present to the world what (so far) is the masterpiece of his career as a film director.Technically, the movie is quite good. The shadowy cinematography and the use of high contrast between light and dark were well used features, and the shooting and framing angles are very clever. The soundtrack, discreetly, also helped to accentuate the film's surrealism at the right times. Of course, its an action movie about an underground fighting club, so there are plenty of scenes of gratuitous violence, some of them quite brutal, as well as nudity and dialogues loaded with insults and profanity. So, I leave my warning to parents: its not a children's movie at all, and even teenagers should only watch it with great caution as its really a violent movie."

In this film there isn't a first and second half, it is a full length movie plain and simple (and believe me, I do understand that they just say that to divide parts of the movie for easier reference). The movie is supposed to be thought like this to show the adaptation of the plot. Please people, seriously! Even the actual critics have ruined what should be an almost, if not completely, perfect score. The scores that some of these critics give leave their comments to \"sick, twisted humor\" or something of the sort - WHAT?! Go critique somewhere else please, because, although the movie is supposed to be humorous (which can be understood by the more deeper thinkers) it is not only a comedy with a crazy plot twist. This movie of course will be liked by some more than others, but if you don't understand the actual plot line and what it really is, then just leave your comments to yourself or share them with a friend, and if you really want to see what the movie conveys, then read some of these reviews or watch the movie again or something! The movie uses so many great techniques, not only in dialogue but also in camera usage and almost eveyr single possible ability that could be used in a movie, really. Oh yeah and back to the quote that I used to start this off (a quote from one of the other users), the movie is not just about \"The theme is about how modern society has reduced males into enneuchs and how this warps our subconscious into anarcho-fascist mode\" (did you not notice the entire appearance of the character Marla Singer?) although it may sound sort of corny, the theme could be considered more along the lines of \"There is a Tyler Durden in all of us\" kind of thing. There is way too much detail to go into for such a well thought out and socially complex movie for me to put in here. Watch the movie again, and if you don't get it - watch it again. An element of the movie that is so genius is that although it is deep and all, the actual approach to the movie and the plot and the entire film, really, is that it doesn't have an \"artsy-fartsy\" kind of setting and dialogue (to some extent yes it does, but you get the point.. I hope) it uses a more down-to-earth realistic view of ourselves, and I say ourselves as everyone, and the actual fabric of human nature and how some things affect the subconscious. Fight Club is really a very, very good movie."

I've never written a review for any film before, but even 9 years after its release, Fight Club has earned it. Violent, yes, of course. It's called Fight Club. But strangely enough, that's a misleading title. It's the most ambiguous fable ever, in that the moral is whatever you make it out to be. This movie solidified Edward Norton to me as a top-tier actor capable of sheer brilliance, and Brad Pitt is amazing as well, cool and scary and ridiculously funny with his red leather jacket. Which brings me to my next point, if you've heard the word \"comedy\" used in relation to Fight Club, you heard correctly. It points out the hilarious nature of society's individuals to try desperately to reach some form of perfection, but of course we know this is impossible. Almost every motif you could think of in a great satirical tale is present in Fight Club. The one I never hear people mention is addiction. (Society"

The best role of Edwarth Northan in his career and perhaps one of the most interesting finals, turning the plot 180 degrees. It's hard to find a more benchmark thriller, David Fincher has done a great job. Fight Club is an out-of-time movie, a classic of the thriller genre that will always be relevant."

A ride with the best actors into a dark tragedy that is somehow morbidly charming. The most significant film that can really make you amazed in many ways. Finishing this great work with one of the best conclusions ever, leaves you mind  blown. What also makes this film special is the main character, after all, doesn't 'solve' the problem like other films. It was a cinematic experience, and frankly speaking, it took me a while to confirm that this is one of the best films I've ever seen so far."
