  "description": "When Jesper distinguishes himself as the Postal Academy's worst student, he is sent to Smeerensburg, a small village located on an icy island above the Arctic Circle, where grumpy inhabitants barely exchange words, let alone letters. Jesper is about to give up and abandon his duty as a postman when he meets local teacher Alva and Klaus, a mysterious carpenter who lives alone in a cabin full of handmade toys.",

      "text": "Klaus is the new animated film on Netflix, which is about how the legend of Santa Claus started involving a reclusive woodsman and a selfish postman. This is a truly inventive, good-hearted Christmas film.The film uses old-fashioned animation with digital techniques to bring a 2 1/2D look to it. This looks AMAZING. I don't think I've seen something quite like this. The painted appearance to the backgrounds and characters looks great. The designs of the characters and locales are all distinctive, especially the characters. There is a wide cast here and they are so stylistically designed. The movie takes place around this town where two clans are at war. The townspeople are such a wonderfully diverse group of grotesques. I also loved the look of Klaus (voiced by J.K. Simmons) who is given a large, broad-shouldered figure. The character movement is also really fluid.The story is equally good. Although the film ultimately goes the way you predict it will, the storytelling in this is so well done that it doesn't much matter. The idea of the story of Santa Claus being told through non-magical reasons and happening through the actions of a postman is definitely something different from most attempts at Santa origin stories. The warring clans part brings a nice dab of dark humor while the sentimental bits are done nicely. All the characters are likable.I highly recommend you check this out. This is just a really well-done family Christmas movie."

The \"critics\" might as well just quit their jobs, because they serve absolutely no purpose but to suck the joy out of the world.  But everyone else with any sense of joy and wonder NEEDS to watch this movie.  Nothing short of a brilliant work of art, this 1 hour and 30 minute marvel will dazzle and amaze.  Never before have I seen an animated feature look so amazing.  Every frame is a work of art, skillfully composed and incredible shaded.  The story is wonderful, and an original one at that.  Sergio Pablos and his team have done something truly EXTRAORDINARY with this gem and I for one can't wait to see what they do next!  Our family will be watching this every year.  It is an instant classic, and THE best original content on Netflix.  Please ignore the cynics and watch this movie over and over again.  Your heart will thank you for it."

      "text": "There is something that tends to be ignored in movies, and that's their moral value - what can be taken and applied to real life. What makes this film work so well is not that it's some silly story about Santa Claus, but the very real impact people can make in our day-to-day lives. How greatness can come from nothing, even ill-intended goodwill is still goodwill, and the results are spectacular. It is this expose of generosity that gives Klaus a real meaning and value beyond the obvious. It's a beautiful story with a core of solid gold that cannot be broken by critics who seem far more comfortable giving high praise to revenge stories, perhaps because they see a bit more of themselves in characters so absorbed in hatred. I am truly shocked a film of this stature only received a 65 on Metacritic, and for some strange reason the rather uninspired Toy Story 4 snagged the Oscar over this masterclass of storytelling. A good story should be what means the most to the audience. And on that front, Klaus excelled in spades. We see a town embroiled in hatred. We see the destitute. We see the excuses. We see good people turned bad. And throughout the movie, a whole lot of bad people turned good. A true act of goodwill always sparks another. That is the foundation of the entire story, and the strength and wisdom of that gives this entire film a transcendent foundation that cannot falter. It's a message we need more of these days, and one that has never been shown more beautifully. A rare 10/10 from me."

      "text": "If you review films as your job you are going to see the same story beats over and over again until you get thoroughly sick of them. And in this movie I really do see where the critics are coming from. This movie has very few surprises in the way it builds its narrative. Even casual movie watchers will recognize each and every part that makes up this movie and there are definitely parts of this movie that are worth criticizing. Some of the jokes fall a bit flat. Some of the line deliveries could have used a second take, etc. However, this is where the critics fail. Often through no fault of their own, apart from being jaded from experience, they too often break down a movie instead of taking it as a whole and that does this movie a massive disservice.This movie has an incredible amount of heart that is present throughout and you can tell that the creators really put their all into presenting it. The animation, atmosphere and storytelling, even if it isn't anything really new, is amazingly adept at making the audience feel. Throwing us between joy and sadness sometimes even in the very same scene.And for a Christmas movie it really nails it. I could see myself watching this every year with my family as it's just that good at setting the Christmas mood.This is, without a doubt, a future Christmas classic."

It\u2019s heartwarming, original (for the most part, there were some elements that reminded me a little of The Emperor\u2019s New Groove or Megamind), funny and the animation is amazing! If I could describe it, well, do you remember the Disney short Paperman? You know, the one where they shaded CGI animation to make it look hand-drawn? Well, Klaus is the opposite. It\u2019s hand-drawn animation that is shaded to look like CGI. I\u2019ve never seen this style before and it looks great! It\u2019s so colourful and well-designed. The voice acting and the writing is really damn good too! Honestly, there are only a couple issues I have. Some of the music choices and what little CGI this movie does use seem out-of-place, but other than that this might be the best Christmas movie since Arthur Christmas. It\u2019s certainly the year\u2019s best animated movie, and the best animated movie in general since Into the Spider-verse. Give it a watch with the family, it\u2019s really delightful!"
