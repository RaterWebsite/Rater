      "text": "It is damn near impossible to say something bad about Sunset Boulevard. A classic in every sense of the word, this one shows why Billy Wilder's work is so critically acclaimed. Brilliant directed, paced, written, and some great acting from William Holden and Gloria Swanson, come together to form one of the most well-known and popular film noirs of all-time. Riveting throughout, this one tells the story of Hollywood gone wrong and really all comes together well. The narration and identity of the narrator were both great, great touches that really worked wonders for the film. The characters are all well-written and, oddly, sympathetic. Overall, Sunset Boulevard is a really cool film that I cannot recommend enough. Though it may not be my favorite film ever obviously, it is still really, really good and you can easily see why it has gotten the praise it has over the years."

Donc c'est William Holden qui s'y colle et je n'ai a priori rien contre lui, car ce n'est certainement pas le pire bell\u00e2tre de ce temps-l\u00e0. Loin de l\u00e0, m\u00eame.Et William donc, sc\u00e9nariste minable devient gigolo \u00e0 son insu ou pas totalement de la... (j'allais \u00e9crire la vieille bique, n'exag\u00e9rons rien) de la vieille dame encore chouette mais pas tout-\u00e0-fait qui n'a pas encore imprim\u00e9 que \"le changement, c'est maintenant\". La voix off tente de mettre du liant \u00e0 cette histoire qui endormirait une tortue mais sans succ\u00e8s, h\u00e9las.Parce que de toute fa\u00e7on, pour blablater \u00e7a blablate, \u00e7a d\u00e9blat\u00e8re et on pique du nez \u00e0 vitesse grand V. La mise en sc\u00e8ne de poisson crev\u00e9 dans le coma n'aide pas non plus \u00e0 tenir la rampe tandis que la \"star\" du muet est d\u00e9cid\u00e9ment tr\u00e8s loquace et une caricature totale, sans nuance et sans talent, y compris jusqu'\u00e0 la fin grotesque.Remarquez, j'ai presque eu un film muet la plupart du temps : pendant qu'on acc\u00e9l\u00e9re avec la t\u00e9l\u00e9commande, on entend plus leurs conneries. Ouf."

      "text": "Not exactly a hot take here, but this is nothing short of one of Billy Wilder's best works and one of the greatest film noirs ever made. The narrative, the structure, the dialogue, the acting, the camerawork - this is one of those impeccably rare occasions where every aspect of a film is so unbelievably well-executed that it really doesn't age. An easy, easy classic and one that should be seen by many, if not all, at one point or another."
