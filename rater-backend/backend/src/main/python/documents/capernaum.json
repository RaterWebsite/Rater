It genuinely cares for its characters especially the wonderful Zain Al Rafeea who gives one of the best performances on screen this year. Despite being heartbreaking, the movie manages to give us some funny moments that highlight the sense of humor Lebanese people have. It also manages to give us a glimmer of hope at the end without leaving behind the devastating reality of its subject matter."

But what we see for two hours is the incredible story of a selfless, courageous, and incredibly energetic child who does what his parents neglect to do \u2013 he takes care of a younger child and the child\u2019s mother, going to great lengths to feed the younger boy and keep him safe, eventually saving the baby\u2019s mother and putting the adults in the story to shame. The boundless energy and single-mindedness of Zain are in stark contrast to his lazy and disinterested parents. It\u2019s an incredible and exhausting story, full of the boy\u2019s energy, courage, and goodness in a dark, chaotic world."

This heart-tugging saga of children being left to fend for themselves by unfeeling parents and an unfeeling bureaucracy evokes genuine emotion through a story that's presented with stark realism and not narrative manipulation. Keep the hankie handy for this one -- you'll need it for when the film touches your heart and for when it nearly rips it out of your chest."

      "text": "This is not a pretty movie but it's a beautiful story. It follows a streetwise boy in Beirut who leaves home and survives in the squalor on the streets, even for a period of time with a baby. Ultimately, he's arrested for a crime and goes to court, where he sues his parents for giving him live. In the central role, Zain al Rafeea is incredible: full of spunk and grit. The performance (if you can call it that) from the 1-year-old is also astounding. Actually, all of the actors create powerful characters and director Nadine Labaki has captured their chaotic life of poverty with humanity and off-hand skill (the title translates to \"Chaos\"). Like many foreign films, there's a less-structured narrative and the neorealistic documentary style sometimes feels aimless. Ultimately, this film will break your heart and touch your soul."

The very young actor embodies this role fully.A rough life, but sweetnes and love is found anywhere, even in the darkest of places. It's only so heartbreaking to see how this young boy tries to do everything he can to do the right thing, and yet the world around him is not letting him. Shockingly real for how it must be in real.It had me in tears."

      "text": "When journalists question Labaki about her \u201cfilm\u201d, she mentions the great political cause that drove her to make it. She speaks of the misery she witnessed, the poor street children whom she drove by one day, her lucky young actor who was granted a visa to Norway thanks to her impactful film, etc. But she carefully avoids talking about\u2026 her film. She\u2019d much rather talk about everything around it, leaving aside any potential ideas regarding her actual cinema. Why? Because she doesn\u2019t have a distinct cinematic voice, so she really doesn\u2019t have anything interesting to say about her own film. And because, as Godard said, \u201ccinema is a form that thinks and a thought that forms\u201d, this complete lack of voice is obvious in her film, which is full of gimmicks, superfluous scenes, and an outrageous \u201ccathartic happy end\u201d worthy of a propaganda film: a (deplorable) government, a lawyer (shamelessly played by Labaki herself) and the media (known for their unprofessionalism) all contribute to rescue the hero, punish the bad guys and restore order and justice. (I say the Lebanese government is \u201cdeplorable\u201d because it still practices torture, gender discrimination, racial discrimination, among a variety of other human rights violations). Formally, the film is shot with a Steadicam and the few drone shots are just there to highlight urban poverty. The fast-paced editing doesn\u2019t leave the audience time to actually look at faces and find genuine expressions in them. Our eyes are never free to wander around the frame - viewers don\u2019t even have time to think, because they\u2019re being held hostage by this chaotic and tearjerking mise-en-scene which desperately begs for their empathy but quickly becomes irritating.Labaki invented a new genre: the cinema-mensonge. Canne's Thierry Fr\u00e9maux made her famous, probably for strategic reasons. But that\u2019s his problem. Film critics and cinephiles are not blind, and they saw the film for what it is: a calculated exploitation of misery made by an uninspired and narcissistic filmmaker."

      "text": "In the early chapters of my life, Lebanon was an elusive figure of my imagination. Being born and raised in Toronto, I would hear stories of my homeland from my cousins, uncles and grandmothers. From their descriptions of the countryside, my homeland played in my mind like a fantastic Wild West; the stories always had an underlying sense that the country was a type of Eden, a magical place with magical people, a gem placed perfectly in the midst of chaos.When I made my first trip to the country I was twelve years old. My familial roots trace back to the northern part of the country to a town called Joub Janine in a region known as the Beqaa Valley which is nestled right below the currently devastatingly war-torn Syria. My experiences were life altering; a colossal shift to my consciousness occurred about the world we live in and how that sucker spins, how you can enter a world so electric and alien to your own world with just a 12 hour flight by plane.My first visit due to age was made up of primarily the country\u2019s decadent cuisine and visits to my family.I went back at the age of seventeen with my brother for three weeks, and it was then that my Wild West fantasy began to take true form in reality. Streets cross each other making a labyrinth of life, electric lines lay over and under and all around each other, looming above the streets like a friendly spider\u2019s web. The youth is passionate and wild, full of life and wisdom gathered from their surroundings complete with beautiful flowing hair and beautifully wrapped Hijabs rest on the woman as they socialize, smoking tobacco out of hookah pipes that give off the most fragrant of aromas. This aroma follows you, like the sun that stays on your shoulders with strength, or the full flavored tobacco that wafts through the streets and barber shop. The barber shop that is run by a man who\u2019s lost his tongue in the war yet he still knows just what you want from your hand signals. Lebanese like to use their hands when they talk, they throw them down towards the floor like they are letting go of weights and point as if they were being cut from a Tintin comic strip. Firearms are readily available and commonplace yet no one ever shoots each other, they are carried for their destined use of protection, and perhaps the occasional couple of discharges in the many farm fields of the country. Seatbelts are ignored and so are road signs, if any, yet everyone seems to get along just fine. Some ride in German automobiles while some entire families ride on one motorized scooter, newborns and all.Capernaum, the newest film by Nadine Labaki shows just how exceptionally talented the renowned Lebanese auteur is at capturing that land that holds my heart, and hers as well. Her style is, if comparable, reminiscent of the flavour of Larry Clark\u2019s Kids, with a dash of Paul Greengrass\u2019s Green Zone, and many hints of Vittorio Di Sica\u2019s brilliant Umberto D. The film is poignant; revolving completely around the world of a twelve-year old boy named Zain (Zain Al Rafeea). He lives in a steamy, crammed apartment with his band of siblings, and neglectful mother (Fadi Yousef) and father (Kawsar Al Haddad) in a war-torn neighborhood in Beirut. His parents out of devastating desperation give their daughter to the landlord of their building in hopes of leniency with their payment of rent, an act that naturally enrages Zain, causing him to run away from his family into the abyss of Beirut.In his journey of self-preservation destiny he meets an Ethiopian migrant worker Rahil (Yordanos Shiferaw). Rahil has an infant child of her own name Yonas (Boluwatife Treasure Bankole), who gives such a contribution to the organic documentary inspired style that is truly remarkable. Rahil takes Zain under her care for some time providing some of the most beautifully shot scenes of intimacy in cinema over the past little while. The film\u2019s heart is transcended through Zain and Yonas; their acting is so poetic, watching these two children interact, with the slightest of movements, give elusive kinetic energy that never feels premeditated in the slightest.Drama ultimately knocks on the films door and heartbreak occurs with Zain climatically commits a violent act causing him to stand in court with his parents. He declares hatred for his parents and seeks justice for them giving him life when they have no intention to properly love or care for him, as well as his siblings. This embodies the idea of Capernaum which is according to Libaki \u201cto give a voice to children who otherwise do not have one.\u201dI have watched a select couple of brief scenes from Labaki\u2019s previous films, yet never have I seen one in its entirety and this was quite the film to start me off. The opening sequence is melodious; we see Zain with a number of other children, horse playing through the tangles of flights of stairs and street corners of the neighbourhood."

      "text": "I wouldn't call it entertaining per se, but it's certainly provocativeTaking as its subject the horrific plight of guttersnipe children in the slums of Beirut, Capharna\u00fcm (the word means \"a place marked by a disorderly accumulation of objects\") is the kind of film of which a superficial reading might suggest miserablism at best, and \"poverty porn\" at worst. The third film from Lebanese writer/actress/director Nadine Labaki, the film is written by Labaki, Michelle Keserwany, and Jihad Hojeily and presents a milieu in which people are discardable, children are bought and sold for a few chickens; 11-year-old girls are married off so their family can pay the rent; babies are fed on ice cubes covered in sugar; refugees roam the streets; mental illness goes untreated; people without a Lebanese identity card don't officially exist. The film works because it never feels like it's exploiting, patronising, or trivialising the poverty it depicts, never attempting to manipulate the audience into feeling a preconceived emotion. On the contrary, it's notable for just how unsentimental it is. However, it's also deeply humanist, with compassion in its DNA and a quiet rage at its core.Telling the story of Zain El Hajj (Zain Al Rafeea), a young boy from the slums who sues his parents for bringing him into the world, the film then flashes back several months, showing Zain running away from home after failing to prevent his parents selling his beloved 11-year-old sister Sahar (Haita 'Cedra' Izzam). Seeking refuge in a rundown amusement park, he meets Rahil (Yordanos Shiferaw), an Ethiopian refugee working as a cleaner. Taking pity on him, she agrees to let him stay with her in exchange for him looking after her one-year-old son Yonas (an absolutely astounding performance by Boluwatife Treasure Bankole) when she's at work, and the trio quickly form a close bond, until one day, Rahil doesn't return home.Utilising a documentarian style, cinematographer Christopher Aoun sticks to handheld cameras and, for the most part, natural lighting. The scenes on the streets of Beirut are especially impressive, with Labaki shooting most of the material from roughly Zain's height, or slightly lower. This allows the scenes to adopt his subjective view of the world, without having to resort to less elegant POV shots. Chadi Roukoz's sound design is also superb in these exterior scenes, with the soundtrack crammed with car horns, shouting, crying, laughter, dogs barking, airplanes flying overhead, traffic on the streets. It's an aural overload, conveying just how the massive city is overwhelming Zain, and again, tying us to his subjectivity.Labaki sets the tone for the film to come in the first shot, as we see Zain, filthy dirty, in only his vest and underwear. It's subsequently driven home multiple times that life is almost worthless here - Sahar is sold for rent money, Rahil is encouraged to sell Yonas in return for forged migrant documents. This is a world in which people think of children as commodities. In such a place, Zain somehow manages to retain his sense of empathy, although he too is infected with the concept that everything is transactional. Nevertheless, in a world where adults are reprehensible, and children their innocent victims, Zain is the story's moral compass, exhibiting a humanity far in excess of any kindness than has ever been shown to him.In terms of problems, the framing device of the trial is awkwardly realised, and for the most part, serves only to interrupt the far more compelling story of Zain, Rahil, and Yonas. The scenes in court also come across as more heavily scripted than everything else. Obviously intended as a means to dramatize how Zain wants a voice, it is nonetheless a narrative contrivance that gets in the way of the more accomplished filmmaking seen elsewhere. Surrounded by the more naturalistic realism of the rest of the film, the court scenes stand out because they feel like a didactic plot machination. There is also something of a sense that Labaki overloads the story, pushing just one too many hardships on Zain, and on occasion, the film feels like it's going to collapse under the weight of human suffering and thematic nihilism. This is a shame because some of the best scenes are those involving Zain and Yonas just going about their day, and if Labaki had had the confidence in these quieter moments, she might have scaled back the socio-political content.Never feeling exploitative, nor glorifying the poverty at its centre, Capharna\u00fcm isn't even especially sentimental. The conclusion is disappointingly didactic, and the journey there harrowing and exhausting. However, in the last shot, Labaki dares to offer a very cautious bit of optimism, and ultimately, the takeaway is not despair, but compassion And empathy."

Capernaum is daring and it screams realism, I can honestly say that this is one of the best films I have ever seen in my life, in other words, this is a work of art."

Even though it is not as splendid as that movie, I took a lot of delight from watching Capernaum, which fully deserves the award for the best foreign picture. Personally, the movie made me realised  all the hardships poor people need to face unfairly, which the rest of us often tend to forget. That chief reason that I gave it an 8 is the final, which didn't really live up to my expectations. I was looking forward to something more meaningful and memorable perhaps, particularly in terms of the boy's destiny. But broadly speaking - actors' outstanding performance(all the more incredible and astonishing considering that they are not really professional actors, but people who went through exactly the sort of experiences that the film depicted), gripping plot, deep emotional impact, a life lesson."
