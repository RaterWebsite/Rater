      "text": "I don't usually review movies but this one really bothered me and I have to share my thoughts.  The Wolf of Wall Street is well written, well shot, and clearly well directed overall. The acting is fantastic, especially from Leo  He put in one of the best performances I seen in a long time.  I have never been so universally approving of how a film was put together yet had such a negative reaction to it.\rI'm a white male and I don't identify as a feminist, but if this film is indicative of the new norm, I may have to start doing so.  The misogyny in this film is so unforgiving and goes so unaddressed that it simply cannot just be satire or a cultural mirror.  I'm not talking about the hookers either.  Repeatedly, women in this film are shown to be unbelievably weak.  Sex is their only commodity, beauty is the only thing that matters.  When Jack's first wife, with whom he has multiple children, finds him cheating with Naomi, all she can do is cry.  We never see her again. She never even mentions their kids!  Naomi is worse.  Even though she is never presented as anything more than a vapid beauty, she is worshiped.  During her most \"powerful\" scene, the only one where she exerts any kind of force over Jack, she is calling him daddy and giving him blue balls.  During the movie, she is completely powerless to address any of Jack's problems with drugs or cheating.  We never even see her try.  The female lead of the movie is a beautiful accessory and nothing else.  All she has to offer him is sex, and she knows it.  Even the woman who is ostensibly the most female stockbroker at Jack's firm is weak  Jack even gives a teary eyed speech about how she never could have made it if he didn't lend her $25,000 when he gave her the job.\rIf the intention of this movie was to wake up people like me, who have probably been watching films like this without batting an eye for years, then Scorcese has succeeded.  Many viewers, however, will probably be too taken in by the flashy editing, language, and fantasy to give it a second thought.\rIt\u2019s a shame that something this destructive has to come in such a well executed package."

The script must have contained the f-word 1000 times. I am not a prude or offended easily but this movie was just down right crude! In a packed theater I noticed many people fall asleep and others just get up and walk out. I stayed to see if the movie ever picked up and was disappointed it never did. I was jealous of those that left. I wasted 3 hours, I'll never get back. It isn't even a renter! This movie could have been an hour long to get its point across but then we wouldn't have had the constant drug abuse and sex shoved down our throats. I've never written a review but this one was so bad I had to! Save your money!"

      "text": "All reviews of Wolf of Wall Street should be liberally peppered with spoilers so the viewing public doesn't waste precious time and money.  It's hard to understand why DiCaprio and Scorsese invested so much of themselves in this movie as director, actor and producers of this appalling production.  One can assume they teamed up once again because they will most certainly make money hand over fist because this surreal, tasteless, vulgar and immature material does and will continue to appeal to the masses. It's disturbing to realize this production reflects how much cash (and other vices such as drugs, alcohol, sex and vulgarity) are controlling forces in the world.  Of course, it's nothing new, but it would be nice to know there are people who value maturity!  Most of us willing to a good laugh and we aren't repressed.  I do question why there's such a compulsion to rely on the lowest common denominator to sell movie tickets.\r While I do believe reviewers should fill their reviews of the Wolf of Wall Street with spoilers, I firmly believe  readers and movie-goers should be able to read a review without learning every detail about a movie or book.  However, I must defend those with physical disabilities as a whole and specifically those with Cerebral Palsy.  The Wolf of Wall Street includes scene(s) in which DiCaprio and his sidekick, Jonah Hill  take copious amounts of old Quaaludes and when they finally start to take affect, the effects are described by DiCaprio as a new level or experience in taking Quaaludes likened to having Cerebral Palsy.  As someone who is profoundly affected since birth with Cerebral Palsy, you can be assured such a depiction was not only\rtasteless, wrong but also offensive.  As someone  born with Cerebral Palsy, I am more than willing to laugh at myself as well. There are times if you don't laugh you'll cry.  This was hurtful because in fact, those with Cerebral Palsy are often intelligent, compassionate and productive members of society.   I loved my career as a social worker and I cherish being a wife, mother and a grandmother. Those involved with this movie should be ashamed of themselves.  I did not leave the movie theater feeling good.  I left feeling angry, dirty, demeaned and heartbroken.  Normally, I would leave such a vile movie but it seemed so surreal, I kept waiting to see if there was a big payoff at the end.  Instead, the movie proved to me it is nothing more than a failure--an enormous flop!!\r I am especially angered because The Wolf of Wall Street had such potential to be an exceptional movie and it's has been poorly promoted.   It occurs to me those involved with the movie  might indeed be ashamed and elected to do little promotion and instead relied on DiCaprio's and Scorsese's name recognition in Hollywood.  In researching the movie, I and many others wrongly assumed the movie was something akin to the movies, Wall Street, Catch Me If You Can with perhaps a  dash of  Goodfellas.  Instead, it was more like, a disgusting remake of Animal House, if that's possible and a disappointing, cartoonish versions of Wall Street and Goodfellas.  If I had the opportunity to counsel Mr. Scorsese and Mr. DiCaprio, I would strongly advise them to seek higher caliber projects where they don't work together anytime soon.\r In studying the media about Wolf at Wall Street, it's obvious one of the biggest concerns was merely to learn of an appropriate release date so the movie and the actors would be eligible to compete during the upcoming awards season.  I know Leonardo DiCaprio will be deserving of many future Oscars and SAG awards.  I also know years from now, Wolf of Wall Street will be a cult favorite but this year Wolf of Wall Street should only win the Razzy."

Some people will inevitably be so put off by the harsh composition of the message that they fail to heed the importance of that message; but in presenting so much of the bad and the ugly behind Wall Street so unflinchingly, Scorsese has crafted an insightful  and important  deconstruction of post-millennial America\u2019s moral erosion. These are the barbarians at our gates."

      "text": "I confess I had some curiosity and some expectations when I went to see this movie. Scorcese and Di Caprio are two of the biggest names in the current film scene, and both have provided us with some nice films. So I wasn't surprised with the fuss around the movie but, when I saw it, I was very disappointed.The film is based on an autobiographical book written by Jordan Belfort, a stockbroker who quickly enriched, through financial maneuvers of high risk and zero legality. The book describes not only the business but the life of luxury, drugs and sex that he took, and the way he eventually paid for it. The film, as far as we understand, is quite faithful to the book's account, and the book also makes an apparently true story. The film resembles \"Goodfellas\" in many ways, but with great differences in which the gangster movie gets the better of it. The main problem of this film lies in three essential points: The first point is the apparent glorification of the fraud and Belfort's dissolute lifestyle. The message passed by the film is \"crime pays\". It spends more than an hour telling us, in detail, the outrages of Belfort and his team of bastards without any need, shocking some public, who leave the cinema with the feeling that the film passes an ethically wrong message, and society does not need to receive it because it receives enough bad influences.The second essential point is the absence of a counterpoint to the scenes of excesses shown. Okay, Belfort is a swine, drug addict and corrupt who has gotten rich too fast and too easy. So? Where is the counterpoint to that? He committed crimes, but what are the effects of his crimes? Who lost out on Belfort's crimes? How can audiences truly realize the size of his mistakes? The public never gets these answers because the film gets too lost in the details of Belfort's scandals. The movie makes people think that Belfort never harmed anyone, and that he was just crazy, or smart.The third negative point is the construction of the characters. They are black-and-white, without the psychological complexity and refinement that we find in \"Goodfellas\", for example. There's no such thing here. The characters are summed up as junkies, sex offenders, eccentrics, some bored cops and little else. DiCaprio was well enough in his role, but being such an abject role, it's impossible to like and enjoy his performance.I think Scorcese thought this film as a comedy, but the truth is that it is not funny. The film is morally shocking, not funny. So, it was a bad idea. This film would have been excellent if it had been conceived as a drama and had behind it some moral balance. That was not the case. It is a mad journey through senseless immorality, without notion and without any pretext than easy laughter, and this is quite unpleasant."

At some points it just plainly goes overboard to a \"fear and loathing in Las Vegas\" style and zero-meaning scenes.\rThe filler about drugs, sex and testosterone takes the stage away from the real movie, ending up probably pleasing just those who we're looking for it, and not much more.\r In fact, there's actually something more to the movie, but while it's well depicted by a good director and actors, in the end it results quite thin and uncertain, leaving a sense of emptiness for how the movie evolves.\r Just like most of Scorsese movies, good premises, excellent technique, but a vacuous result.\r Feels more like a long video clip."

Like the Aunt Margret character who states at one point... yeah I lived through the 60's. I was feeling like Scorsese thought his audience wasn't sophisticated enough to understand the excess these guys thrived on. I think we got that in the first half hour. Too bad we don't get to see a little more dimension of this guy, but instead time is wasted on the same old repetitive behavior over and over again sex, drugs, sex, drugs, greed, greed, greed. This movie had so many great things going for it but just goes over the top to try to be funny but instead is just plain obnoxious. Too bad so many talents were wasted because of the lack of tightening up and cutting scenes  and developing other characters to counter the balance of the the over-all story. It was actually fun to sit through once but I don't think this will be one in my DVD collection."

There is no problem with the direction and the acting is top notch, especially Jonah Hill who keeps getting better with each performance. It is a true adaptation of Belfort's novel. The pace can be electrifying at times, so good you forget the 3 hour running time. Cinematically, it has subtle moments of genius. So why a mediocre review? Personal prejudice with the subject matter. While watching this movie, you wait for redemption or at least true punishment. You expect Jake LaMotta to live a sad life, Henry Hill to crumble and Joe Pesci was doomed in both Goodfellas and Casino. They were satisfying endings because in the moral mind of the audience, they reaped what they had sown. I don't believe I am spoiling anything when I say Belfort has not really been given, what most of our recently recession minds would consider, a gigantic cross to bear. I believe the mixed reviews you are seeing have a lot to do with the time of release. Most people won't get past the \" These are the clowns that killed the economy\" feeling. The Wolf comes at you hard and doesn't let up. It is a spot-on take of the excess of boiler room bandits. Movie making wise, Scorsese remains a master and his muse DiCaprio brilliant. Another time and another place, maybe I would enjoy it. For me, it was too exhausting. It was excess on the excess. I know it was real to the core, I have met some of the characters. These are empty people. I guess I am just at that stage in life where I want to escape when I go to the movies. The Wolf is great film making, but it is also a horrendous story about horrendous people."

It is at least an hour too long as well and wastes a ton of time.  This movie isn't about what Jordan Belfort did with stocks and cheating people AT ALL.  I spent the last hour of the movie looking at my watch and had I realized it was 3 hours long I would have left with the third of the theater that got up and walked out within the first hour.\r It gets a one because there were a few seriously hilarious parts of the movie but I wouldn't even recommend most people get Netflix to send it to them when it comes out on dvd."

      "text": "The Wolf of Wall Street is very long, very loud, full of brazen immoral behavior, repellent characters, completely over-the-top, and a brilliant black comedy.\r Reading through the reviews by professional critics and users it appears that except for my conclusion in that lead-in sentence, everyone agrees about what is on the screen  whether they give it high ratings, mixed ratings or low ratings. It is not a case of one person seeing one thing and another seeing something different.\r The immoral (not amoral) life of Jordan Belfort requires this treatment  the movie is what he was: loud, brazenly immoral, repellent, completely over-the-top and a brilliant con man. A more \"restrained\" treatment could not have done it justice.\r Are you offended by what you see in this movie? Good! It is offensive, but that is the point. You need to see how offensive Belfort and his whole operation was/is. This bad, bad behavior is being held up for ridicule. Laughing at it is the only way viewing it could be tolerable. He does not deserve to be treated as a serious man.\r But there is a serious sub-text to this movie. It is an indictment of Wall Street as a whole. The film makes this clear, as Belfort spends one day in a \"legitimate\" Wall Street firm on 1987's Black Monday, and is exposed to the immoral operation of the \"best\" firms: the fact that all brokers are essentially conmen fleecing their clients. His genius is to take what he sees and break it free from its shackles of faux respectability, starting with his initial staffing  hiring buddies who are small time drug dealers. He is not debasing Wall Street, he is embodying it in its purest form.\r And the end of movie makes a very cogent point: how modern society treats the parasites of Wall Street. We see the FBI agent who could have been a broker, and rich, if he had chosen to be a Wall Street conman riding on the subway home. We see Belfort's punishment: 22 months in a country-club prison, and a fine of only part of his vast ill-gotten wealth, where a poor man guilty of 1% of his crimes would have spent 20 years of hard time. And we see the audience of Belfort's \"sales\" seminars looking hungrily at him, desperately wanting to be able to do what he did.\r Having seen the miscreants on Wall Street that crashed the economy at the cost of trillions of dollars to the nation in 1987, walk scott-free, not a single indictment much less a conviction, and not even miss one of their bonuses, this is a very timely movie.\r DiCaprio is a necessity in the lead role. It does not draw on his full capabilities, and he carries the role easily, but only a top-flight charismatic actor could portray Belfort and bring the audience along with his utterly self-centered, corrupt, destructive ride.\r This movie forms a trilogy with two of Scorsese's other films: Goodfellas (one of the best films ever made) and Casino. They all chronicle the rise and fall of the hustler.\r The only reason I give this a 9 instead of a 10, is that then I have no where to go with rating Marty's other great films, several of which (like Goodfellas) are among the best movies ever made."

Does 12 Years a Slave glorify slavery? Absolutely not. It is doing the opposite: Showing the true horrors of slavery. Did Schindler's List glorify Nazism? No. It shamed it. How is this movie any different? It takes a historical event, and takes a way of living that is truly disgusting, and shines the spotlight on it. It tells it like it is. It is telling us that this is the real American dream, that the life of Jordan Belfort is currently what so many of us to aspire to be. And it shows why that is not Ok, why that is wrong.\r As a film, it is a 3 hour rollercoaster ride. As art, it is a picture of our way of life."

      "text": "The Wolf of Wall Street is spectacular. Three hours of extremely well developed characters with Leo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill leading the way. Although most should thoroughly enjoy it, some may have a weak stomach when it comes to the near overdose the audience experiences watching and hearing the  explicit language, constant use of narcotics and naked women. My reasoning for giving a 9 instead of a 10 is the length, don't get me wrong, none of it is dry but instead of walking out of the theater  exclaiming how fantastic the show was, those around me  made comments like they were getting off a flight. If you can't sit through three hours at the big screen, wait for the DVD/BluRay and get comfy at home."

The intense relationship between Mr. DiCaprio and Jonah Hill reminded me of Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci in Raging Bull.  Its the very best by all involved.   I find the criticism of this film because it degrades women, glorifies money, and promotes drug use down right silly. Its a great movie about men who degrade women, glorify money and use drugs."

The movie never loosens up and it's manic pace keeps you glued to the screen. One of the most amusing movies around."

      "text": "The Wolf of Wall Street might have ended up being OK if it weren't for Martin Scorsese's lack of restraint. He somehow makes endless sex, drugs, violence, crime, etc. feel like sitting through a boring lecture. Three hours is most definitely WAY too long for any movie, especially this one. It was just scene after scene of the same thing. The acting, however, redeemed it a little, and there are a few genuinely funny moments throughout the film."

      "text": "\u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d was directed by Martin Scorcese and stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill in the true story of Jordan Belfort, the self-made millionaire who operated a stock brokerage telemarketing operation that ultimately led to his ruin and the ruin of his company and his duped investors. I\u2019m no fan of Mr. DiCaprio who, no matter what adult role he plays, always reminds me of a little boy wearing his father\u2019s felt hat. However, in this film, Mr. DiCaprio overcomes my previewing prejudices and is quite believable in his role as Mr. Belfort but, unfortunately, that\u2019s where the kudos end. The film is 3 hours long but seems more like 6. Thelma Schoonmaker is being touted by the producers for \u201cBest Film Editing\u201d but her work product, at least to this viewer, is virtually unnoticed. The film is filled with gratuitous sex scenes that are more crude than craft and actually get in the way of the story and plot. Orgies may have their place in depicting a scene in a Roman harem but they simply detract from the film and like most of the unneeded scenes, add to the uncomfortable length of the picture. I give the film a 5 and recommend that, if you do go to see it, bring lunch and/or dinner, although the raunchy and tasteless scenes will probably destroy any appetite you might otherwise have had."

      "text": "Yes yes, the depictions in the film and majority of the acting was over the top, but that's precisely what it needed to be. How can you expect some boring, dull screenplay and actors to carry on and illustrate the real events that happened? This film is not just about 'corruption' by the way. Not entirely at least; it's mainly about greed. It does not 'glorify' Jordan Belfort; all this film does is portray to the audience how greed tore him and his associates apart, and it stayed true to the book. He starts out poor, and a fairy decent human being at the beginning, and all he wants to do is get ahead. Then once he gets what he wants, he starts to want more and more. This film is about the human condition. We always want more than we need and we will always try to bend the rules to get it. Once currency came in to play there were people being corrupted by it, and that won't change until our species is dead."

Its typical Scorsese magic, as despite the long 3 hour running time the director manages to build the character of Jordan Belfort in-depth with careful meticulousness, from his normal man aspiring to complete the everyman's dream of hitting it big on Wall Street to the dissipation of his family and friends as he plummets down to earth with the weight of his lies and moral corruption pushing down on him hard. Its a grandiose movie that absorbs its audience with pleasure and excess and also manages to make them care about the man's story."

The scenes were painfully long and drawn out to the point of me wanting to yell out \"ok I get the idea can we move on?\".    I made it as far as 2 hours and fifteen minutes and had to leave.   What I saw in that 135 minutes could have been well covered in half that time.   Rather than torture myself with the remaining 45 minutes I'm sure someone will tell me the ending in 25 words or less.   This topic was already covered in Wall Street and Boiler Room.   Rent those and save your time and money."

Normally I would call Martin one of the top directors of the era  BUT this movie is terrible on every level. Gratuitous sexual humor that goes on forever to the point of it becoming a soft-core porno! Nothing remotely redeeming in any character. And I generally always come out of a Scorsese movie quoting at least a few great lines  I can't think of anything said in this movie at all. It is so bad that it now makes me wonder about Scorsese and his career in total! Be warned and skip this awful rubbish."

I didn't know that the awesome duo of Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio could pull off a comedy, but apparently they can; and it's hilarious.\r It's one of the reasons why Scorsese is such a legend. To be at his age and still create movies, not to mention working in a genre almost entirely new to him, is just amazing.\r Leo gives, in my opinion, the best performance of his already storied career. I'm definitely remembering this one for a long time.\r Jonah Hill is also funny as hell. And so is the rest of the supporting cast. The plot and script are both riveting.\r Perhaps my only problem with the film is the ending. It felt kinda sudden. One second Leo is talking to an audience, and the next it's the credits.\r But other than that, it's a Must See. Not even it's long duration (3 hours), was a problem to me. The film wasn't boring in any way. It's a terrific depiction of Jordan Belfort, his rise and fall, and the outrageous lifestyle that he and his friends lived in the 1990s."
