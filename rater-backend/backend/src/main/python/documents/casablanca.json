For reference, I just watched it for the first time ever in 2021.  \u201cCasablanca\u201d is a story of convictions, romance, and lost love.  Right from the beginning it throws so much at you that it is hard to keep up, and the story goes in so many unexpected directions.  There are a ton of characters, and yet somehow, every one of them, with the exception of the Nazis, won me over.  This movie is super heavy on dialog, but unlike modern cinema where characters talk just to fill time, the dialog in \u201cCasablanca\u201d feels like it is all in support of the plot, which forces you to hang on every word or else you will get lost. Anyone with a tolerance of full framed black and white should be able to take something enjoyable away from this movie.  I give it an A - Make a point to go see this movie."

I honestly don't care that it's an old film, I personally think that's not a convincing enough excuse for hating a film as wonderful as this , because you are seriously missing out, if you haven't seen it. The cinematography is just fantastic, with clever brooding camera-work. The music by Max Steiner is outstanding, from the sweeping haunting love theme As Time Goes By, to the excerpts of the french national anthem. The scene where everyone starts singing in the caf\u00e9 was extraordinary and one of the many highlights of the film. The screenplay is unquestionably one of the finest in the history of cinema, right up there with Shawshank Redemption and All About Eve, containing great memorable lines such as \"seems as though Destiny is at hand\". The performances were superlative, Humphrey Bogart giving one of cinema's greatest lead performances as the \"cynical sentimentalist\" Rick Blain. Also superb are Ingrid Bergman who positively lights up the screen as Ilsa, the young woman who breaks his heart, Paul Henreid as the fugitive husband, and Claude Rains as Captain Renault. The plot is a little complicated, but I couldn't help being impressed with the performances and the screenplay. Not to mention a timeless love story that I don't think has ever been topped. Overall, a masterpiece, that quite rightly received an academy award for best picture. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

The characters and how they develop are so amazing, and it's impossible to watch without  empathizing with the resistance.I wonder, is this the first movie with a surprise twist at the end? If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and watch this one immediately!"

      "text": "Bogart and Bergman are changing history, witness it now or a century later, something so pure as such, doesn't get rusty.CasablancaCurtiz is light on his feet and smooth as the Jazz that is continuously and melodiously played in the hotel. And I think it is his supervision that blends in sacrifice in romance, so pure and irreplaceable, that drama is overshadowed by its crowd pleasing concept. The director, Michael Curtiz installs tiny notions in the script that carves a momentum of live hotel and the do's and don'ts of a hotelier especially the magnetic reputation he or she juggles by dipping his or her hands on both the side of the dirt.The Robin Hood figure, is their way in, and with Humphrey Bogart playing one of the most iconic character, the first act of the film is building up his figure that is latter to be shattered with such fragility. But the final act is brimmed with charm, so where they actually had to work was the introduction. And choreographed like some exotic dance, the entire hotel that is mapped out in front of us, makes us feel like home something that has aged well over the years. Personally, I prefer the sacrifice of his hotel's fairness regarding the gambling policies.To me, that would always be the game changer, not only the actress's performance but the tone that shifts with such calculative baby steps that you are sinking in deliberately in those twinkling eyes. And if Bogart is boasting off with some of his best work then Ingrid Bergman definitely casts the magic powerful enough to rubble him down in a blink. Their equation is like some wine, you are buzzed with the aftermath soberness rather than their poetic romantic vacation. Casablanca defines the Hollywood version of Americana set in a different location, it was ahead of its time then and it is now; all hail the classic dish serving one purpose and one only."

If it ever feels clich\u00e9d (and it does), there's a big chance this movie started that clich\u00e9.It can feel dated, but there's still a lot of power to it. An entire bar playing \"La Marseillaise\" to drown out the sounds of a group of nazis is as powerful as you can get while still maintaining just the right amount of Hollywood sentimentalism.
