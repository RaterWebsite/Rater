      "text": "This is the best horror film ever made. It\u2019s brilliant, scary and well written. Clive Barker\u2019s direction gives this film so much more depth, there\u2019s so much symbolism in the imagery and cinematography. The characters are extremely well-fleshed out, especially for an 80s horror film. The effects are also amazing, the stop-motion and makeup combined with the creature designs also make for a thoroughly enjoyable watch."

      "text": "Hellraiser made in 1987 is a horror classic... A man died upstairs inside a house after solving a puzzle box and his body is resurrected from beneath the floorboards when his brother spills blood on the floor and he needs fresh blood from humans to grow skin on his resurrected body. Doug Bradley is good as the leader cenobite who comes out of the box and the other demon cenobites and evil helpers also rock. This is by far the best Hellraiser in the series and it's very gory more than anything and pretty dark. Andrew Robinson is also great as Kirsty's (Ashley Laurence) dad but I kind of feel sorry for him near the end as he's butchered and that's when the cenobites catch up with Frank Cotton. Excellent horror film and one of it's best in it's genre."

      "text": "Clive Barker's Hellraiser made in 1987 delivers darkness beyond imagination as a puzzle box is solved by a character named Frank Cotton (Sean Chapman) and then his flesh is savagely ripped apart by chains which appear from the puzzle box then we see a few characters walking around who came out of the box too,  the main one being Pinhead (Doug Bradley) who's leader of the cenobites who are these demon figures. A new family move into a house where Frank died in upstairs but unknown to the family, then Larry (Andrew Robinson) who's the father spills his blood on the floor upstairs after an accident and it resurrects Frank's (Sean Chapman) corpse into a living being and he needs dead victims to grow skin on his bone and become whole again... Ashley Laurence and Doug Bradley give good performances in the original and best Hellraiser in the series. A great horror movie classic."

      "text": "Not the best quality blu-ray I've seen by a long shot. Still it looks better than the DVD. The surround is occasionally excellent but mostly unnoticeable. Sound is solid but not outstanding. This is the most creative amazing Hell-related horror ever. Not as scary as The Exorcist (1973) but it is more fun. The concept is fantastic and the execution is brilliant. The follow-up takes the concept further but subsequent sequels basically go to hell. I love this film! It is a brilliant ride that is perfectly paced with lots of hellish moments. The bit in the hospital still haunts me today. Something far more terrible than life could imagine. I love the progression, the anticipation and the hell demons. This has to be the best movie from hell. It is creepy, scary and one hellish ride!"

      "text": "Edgar Allan Poe meets H.P. Lovecraft in this first installment to the classic horror franchise, writer/director Clive Barker not only gives us the spine-tingling practical makeup and gore effects, but he gives us what makes every horror movie much, much better -- moral intrigue! For real though, the best horror movies (Poltergeist, Psycho, Friday The 13th, The Exorcist etc.) all have some sort of moral element in play that's as disquieting to the audience as it is fascinating. \"Hellraiser\" does this very well. And despite some undeniably dopey elements here and there, this is a very solid flick."

      "text": "As a gross out video nasty type film, this is ok. It has its fairly gross out moments, with excessive blood loss and peoples skin being stretched and ripped to an extraordinary extent and so on. The plot I felt was a bit too thin on the ground - I got the main gist of it but I can't say I was perhaps as scared as I maybe might have been, if I'd fully understood the context of everything but then again, its probably not the kind of film to be entirely overly analysed to (pardon the pun) death and back, as it were.The plot is perhaps a little slow to build up but then maybe it's more like riding a rollercoaster, as you know there's going to be something quite visually shocking about to appear around the proverbial corner but you don't know precisely when. I was a bit frustrated somewhat towards the end, when the daughter appeared to have somehow escaped the hospital she'd been confined in. If your really into these kind of films then I suppose you'd likely quite enjoy aspects of it. I've tended to avoid slasher/overly gory horror films but I saw this film was recommended by a film review group called Wittertainment, so I thought I'd give it a go out of curiosity more than anything, I suppose. I felt that if it had been a bit less fantasy based, it may have been more scary.For what it is, it's an ok film but for me it wasn't an entirely memorable film. I wouldn't particularly recommend it, no."

My biggest problem is that I feel this film isn't as complete as the first Nightmare on Elm Street or Childs Play. I feel those movies did a much better job at setting up the killers and the universe."

The \"story\" in this movie is pretty thin and simple, but that is because everything is subservient to the spectacle of horror and evil.  And what a spectacle!  Seriously this movie will stick with you for a long time, so settle in for true horror."
