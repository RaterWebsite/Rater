  "description": "It's been 10 years since John Connor saved Earth from Judgment Day, and he's now living under the radar, steering clear of using anything Skynet can trace. That is, until he encounters T-X, a robotic assassin ordered to finish what T-1000 started. Good thing Connor's former nemesis, the Terminator, is back to aid the now-adult Connor \u2026 just like he promised.",

He dumps one cell at the beginning of the film and the other cell at the end - leaving him with no cells and no power. Yet somehow, unbelievably, he keeps operating as though he has power and the light in his eye only goes out *after* the .. um... \"grand finale\". Where is this mysterious battery power coming from? The repeating scenes from the other T-films was absurd. Quotes were being repeated.. whole action sequences seemed to have been copy-pasted over.. I can't see this film having much rewatchability."

Remember in T2 where they destroy all the evidence in the cyberdyne building and the arm and chip from the old terminator from the 1st movie, well in this film it's showing you that it was all pointless and a waste of time. T2 ended perfectly with the emotion of the terminator having to destroy itself to destroy all evidence of skynet but now he comes back and he says that it has been delayed for no reason at all. There wasn't any music to the film until the end, john conner acts like a complete wimp compared to what he was like when he was 10, how the TX can just zap a car and make the pedals and steering rack move i do not know (seeing that there are no electronic parts in the pedals or steering wheel. This really is a bad film to the terminator franchise, if anyone out there thinks this is a good film to add to your terminator collection then they obviously don't know and care about the terminator story!"

But I disagree, it really is epic and it totally succeeds with action.\r The movie starts with a damn exciting, and action-packed opening scene that got the classic and hilarious Terminator touch. The first and second act got extremely great action sequences, it\u2019s so massive and it keep going and going. I really love it. The third act got less action-quantity but instead greater quality. Therefor is it much more epic. The plot of the movie is very entertaining, but not as original. There are many similarities between this and the previous movie; Terminator 2: Judgment Day, which makes this film less unique. The actors though, are wonderful. There\u2019s also great chemistry between the characters, but it feels a bit too forced and dry. The movie lack character development and there\u2019s not much magical, funny and awesome interactions between them as we saw in the previous movie.\r When it comes to the villain is the T-X awesome, she\u2019s a real competitor to the T-1000. She\u2019s also much cooler but unfortunately not as scary. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is overall very well made, but there are vague CGI at many places. But the action sequences are of course fantastic and highly entertaining. I could not be more satisfied. The soundtrack gives the movie a scary and challenging feeling, but it could have been even more excessive to trigger an emotional response. The ending of the movie is great, but it made the whole film a bit meaningless. It\u2019s still a great ending though.\r It does have some serious flaws, but it\u2019s still an awesome action movie that worth watching!\r Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines gets an 8.2/10."

The original is still a masterpiece despite some very dated effects, the second has dated in quite different ways but is still remarkably charming...but the real surprise? The third film is nowhere near as weak as I remember!Given much of what has passed for \"blockbuster\" entertainment since, Terminator 3 holds up remarkably well. Yes, it's largely a retread of the second film - far more than the second is a retread of the first - but it's admirable entertainment, all told. Virtually none of the emotional punch of the first two, but...hey...it's a heck of an improvement over the fourth film in the series, Salvation. (Which I'll evidently be subjecting myself to next. Wish me luck!)"

      "text": "Terminator 3 directed by Jonathan Mostow and made in 2003 was sadly the last half decent Terminator film made. Everything since  Terminator 3 is pure dinosaur droppings from Jurassic Park. For me Terminator 3 was the only real sequel to Terminator 2 as it doesn't insult James Cameron's classic sci fi action flick. Once again like in T2, Arnold Schwarzenegger is sent to protect John Connor and this time also some girl named Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) but also a newer deadly machine is sent to Kill them in the form of the beautiful T-X (Kristanna Loken). What the film lacks in terms of action Kristanna Loken makes up for by her gorgeous figure, beauty and sex appeal however this film has some of the greatest action scenes I've ever seen and some good stunts and it has loads of good humour. The only annoying thing is Nick Stahl as John Connor because he's annoying in Terminator 3 but besides that this is a worthy sequel to Terminator 2 and a great entry into the Terminator film series. I think Terminator 3 was great and Kristanna Loken was beautiful as the villain terminator TX who was similar to the T-1000 and the TX had a flame thrower and other variety of weapons and could immitate other human beings. Terminator 3 was good"

The music just seemed a little random & not stiring at all,The actor that played John Connor was ok,but he reminded me constantly of Dr Bashir in Deep Space 9(for tht longest time,i thought it was the same actor)!,& Claire wasnt particulally likeable or interesting.Another BIG critisism to this film,is casting a woman as the other Terminator.I'm sorry if this sounds sexist,but no matter how much she kept a straight face,i just couldnt take her seriously as a threatening Terminator.. Making her Boobs grow,to get positive treatment from a police officer didnt exactly help this either.. Even though the story explains how the war with the machines started,most of the film seemed pointless & unessasary.There was also too much humour,& silly bits,for example when the TX gets hit in her head,her head spins round,the afforementioned growing boobs,& the stripper he gets his clothes & 'Star shaped Sunglasses'? from. this movie seemed kind of a joke to me,& that the joke was on me..

Unable to locate John in the past, Skynet sends a new Terminator model back in time to John's present time period to instead kill other top members of the future Human Resistance, thereby ensuring Skynet's rise.Terminator 3 is a decent enough action movie with some excellent special effects and exciting scenes, but it\u2019s a movie that just never seems necessary and the ending essentially completely undoes the finale of the previous movie. As a stand alone action flick it\u2019s entertaining enough for the most part, but as a Terminator movie and follow up to one of the best films ever made it\u2019s a disappointment."

      "text": "The third movie of the Terminator Saga was not directed by James Cameron anymore but Jonathan Mostow. The movie also changed its studio from Metro Goldwyn Mayer into Warner Bros. Pictures.  It is a lot like the second movie: Judgment Day. A terminator was sent to kill John Connor again. The last movie we had T- 1000 and then it\u2019s T-X, a completely new terminator. After dying in Judgment Day, T-800 had returned and took some punk clothes and sunglasses, just like the first two. It should change I think.  Everybody loved to see a terminator movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger and he made his third debut in the third movie. However, I wasn\u2019t impressed with the plot that T-800 wasn\u2019t a series 101 but a different one, a protagonist with a dark and strict character. He forgot everything John taught him in Judgment Day: the smile, Hasta La Vista Baby and more. I was really disappointed with that fact. John Connor wasn\u2019t played by Edward Furlong anymore, the role changed to Nick Stahl, who had been known for being in Sin City (2005). The performances weren\u2019t as good as the previous two but they weren\u2019t terrible. Schwarzenegger wasn\u2019t trying his best for the third movie so I think the best performance here was Nick Stahl\u2019s John Connor. He was excellent making the character Katherine Brewster played by Claire Danes agreed to be on their side. It\u2019s great to see the two together. The really big problem here was T-800. He knew too much and he kept predicting futures. It\u2019s not necessary to or maybe he shouldn\u2019t say it. It\u2019s like spoiling a movie with great contents. T-800 said the two got married, John would be terminated in 2032 and more things that we wouldn\u2019t want to be spoiled. When T-800 revealed when John Connor dies, it was the stupidest thing to say. And it got worse when T-800 revealed the killer,\u2026him. I called this the biggest issue in this movie. It\u2019s really terrible and I hate it! See, that\u2019s why this one\u2019s the least popular of the Terminator Saga based on IMDb (6.3/10).  However, I don\u2019t hate the other parts of the movie, they were good. The CGI was okay and so was the cinematography. The action sequence were epic and instead of saying his words (Hasta La Vista, Baby) to kill T-X, T-800 said: \u201cYou are Terminated!\u201d. That would explain that T-800 completely forgot about what John had taught him in Judgment Day. It\u2019s not one of the bests in the Saga, but it wasn\u2019t too bad. I\u2019m looking forward to see more: Terminator Salvation, Terminator Genisys and Dark Fate. I\u2019m starting to like this franchise.Ratings: 6.8/10"

It's not quite as intelligent given that there are a few questionable moments and missteps in logic that are noticeable. However the plot is still complex enough to make it worth following. It's got more brains than the average action film.\r Speaking of the action it's a blast to watch. Quite literally in fact. Explosions and gunfights are everywhere. It manages to keep a large level of destruction and mayhem with out coming off as excessive or just plain noisy. I love how the director incorporated the weight of the Terminators into the action. The previous two films didn't have too much of that.\r As far as the acting goes it's just as great as the other two films. The human characters are believable, and the actors playing the Terminators show just the right amount of non-expression. Schwarzenegger is just as great as ever.\r While it doesn't quite reach the heights of it's predecessors and has some questionable moments, fans of the series can still find this to be a worthy entry.

Como la muerte, la creaci\u00f3n de una I.A real, etc. Lo que molestara a los fans de las pel\u00edculas es que el inicio no esta bien enfocado.

Aqu\u00ed no esta ese orden y esta algo fuera de lugar. Pero si hablamos de las escenas de acci\u00f3n son incre\u00edbles, el CGI se ve bien, un poco raro aveces pero es 2003, me sorprende lo bien que se ve para su \u00e9poca, los efectos pr\u00e1cticos/reales tambi\u00e9n abundan, eso siempre ayuda. Yo fui a esta pel\u00edcula intentando disfrutarla, el inicio puede molestar por un par de tonter\u00edas como que John Connor toma pastillas que les dan a los animales sin saber que son.

But as I said, it dosent offer anything new."

Quelques excellentes id\u00e9es sont aussi fort judicieusement exploit\u00e9es avec par exemple la terminatrice dont le d\u00e9veloppement et l\u2019inventivit\u00e9 laissent bouche b\u00e9e.Finalement, pas mal de recul pour ce film d\u2019action qui sait rester spectaculaire et perp\u00e9tuer la mythologie de cette saga qui rebondit au rythme des retours vers le futur simple du pass\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur.Ce Terminator 3 est \u00e9videmment \u00e0 prendre au second et m\u00eame au troisi\u00e8me degr\u00e9 : il s\u2019agit en v\u00e9rit\u00e9 d\u2019un film entier d\u00e9di\u00e9 au fan service et \u00e0 ce titre il excelle d\u2019une fa\u00e7on inattendue. On a par ailleurs une r\u00e9alisation solide (Jonathan Mostow n\u2019est pas un branque) dans l\u2019ensemble malgr\u00e9 une grosse poursuite certes spectaculaire mais trop d\u00e9sordonn\u00e9e et mal film\u00e9e. Le rythme reste soutenu de bout en bout et les effets sp\u00e9ciaux sont toujours au sommet !"
