Its realy enjoyable and Sonic felt real the entire movie"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "It could have been the worst disaster for SEGA, but they did manage it very well. I don't give It a 10, because there are a lot of things missing. The addition of Tails and the way Robotnik gets mad totally makes you relive the old games, it may be difficult for someone that hasn't ever played a sonicgame to understand that details but is still good."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Don\u2019t believe the hate! Sonic the Hedgehog is a pleasant movie with some decent jokes and some likeable characters. Jim Carey Steals the show with a role he was born to play. It starts a little slow, but otherwise a good, if unspectacular experience."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "The movie was very moving for me. It reminds me of my childhood. Jim Carrey is an incredible actor. It worths to go and have a good time!"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Really loved it.  Was totally on par with the pokemon movie. I laughed and almost cried. sonic is funny and the action is good and the way they introduced video game concepts to a live action movie was clever."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Awesome movie!  Rare case of a game to movie adaptation that is actually good. Jim Carrey being actually funny again in a movie too!"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "It was everything I wanted it to be. It was nostalgic, had excellent writing, it had a hyper potions song in it for christs sake! Im glad I went to see it alone because I was a sobbing wreck for half of the movie. Absolutely wonderful. I really wanted to hate it too but it was just so good it changed my mind. Anybody that says otherwise has no idea what they're talking about."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Loved it! Sit back and soak in this fun film, don't think too seriously and look for logic. Just enjoy it for what it is like you would a video game! Loved all the call backs and references. Fans should stay for the secret bonus scene. Bring on Sonic 2!"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This is a children\u2019s movie, and a well done one at that. If I had kids, I\u2019d take them to see this \u2014 something I can\u2019t say about most movies in the current age. Fun, simple, and a great performance from Jim Carrey: I really hated this character, which is the entire point. Highly recommended for kids, or the adult looking for some simple wholesome fun."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Possibly one of the best movies I\u2019ve ever seen. Raises the bar by a mile for video game movies. Sonic\u2019s cocky attitude was translated into the movie beautifully. My favorite iteration of Sonic at the moment. Won\u2019t spoil much, but the final end credits scene really makes me want another Sonic movies, or at least a follow up game. While the humor at times could be lackluster, there were many hilarious moments in the movie."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "One of the best video game movies in a long time, watched the movie together with my brother and we both liked it.Is not perfect but well worth watching."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "The movie was so fantastic honestly without any lies, I like it its full of comedy especially jim caren role so marvelous That my opinion I hope u see the movie and like it so let's support it"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Vale la pena ir a verla, la adaptaci\u00f3n y los arreglos hechos a sonic tuvo buenos resultados. La historia es entretenida y para los fans no creo que queden haya decepci\u00f3n."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Okay, that was fun. A legitimately good, entertaining movie. Was it a game changer? No. Did it have flaws? Sure, yes. But did I sit there, the whole movie long, with a big grin on my face? Absolutely. Jim Carrey stole the goddamned show, as is only right and proper. This was full on 1995 Jim, where you take the goofy, chaotic neutral Trickster/Coyote that is The Mask and go full on sinister evil. That's Dr Robotnick.Oh, and Raul Julia must now surrender the Overacting As A Video Game Villain belt. Dear god, no scenery escaped chewed. Actually that's very apt - if you liked Street Fighter, then Sonic is RIGHT up your alley!The sonic redesign was fine, the effects worked. The script is very linear and the characters very broad - but I don't mean that in a pejorative way. They're very basic archetype characters that get the job done and do what they need to do and I found myself caring about them and their fates. That's a win in any book.Is it flawless? No. Does it reshape cinema forever? No. But it's fun and full of heart and charm and is completely entertaining. The movie is exactly what it needs to be, no more, no less. I absolutely recommend the movie to any and all. It was a fun evening out."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "It's a generic kids movie with a few funny jokes, meme-worthy brand deals, and some incredibly sick action scenes. In Sonic 2 let's: let's get more action scenes, refine Tail's design, and tone down Sonic's more annoying traits.Tyson Hesse is a miracle worker,, god bless."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "My Family and I love this movie. We are so thankful for the redesign and how it allowed us to feel immersed with Sonic. Throughout this movie, we had genuine laughs and you could tell the audience and children among them, really liked it. My son said, he would be so bummed if they did not make a sequel. This one is great for the family."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Adorei o filme! Um dos melhores que j\u00e1 vi. Adoro o franquia Sonic o que ajuda mais ainda a gostar do filme! NOTA 10!!!"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Very good film( I'm not Sonic fan) Jim Carry was the best. And it's kind of funny."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "First I would like to thank you Paramount Pictures. Other studios need to take a page out of your book. I don't care if that disaster of a reveal was a marketing scheme or not your correction got my butt in the seat opening weekend rather than a $5 tuesday.Second, opening weekend every showing was so packed i had trouble getting a good seat at any time. So congrats.Now to the movie itself. The good the bad the ugly. Ill start rather than end with score. 9/10.Is it perfect no. But for what it is its the best movie I've seen in a long time. The character(s), that is plural btw stay after the credits to see what i mean, look amazing. Although you did make me think of Weresonic a couple times so that's a negative.I was laughing and having a great time some based on nostalgia some based on enjoying kids movies. Either way I was happy for about the entire runtime. Was there logical inconsistencies sure. Some made sense cuz it was a kids movie other didn't make sense but it was ok because it was forgivable for a kids movie, i.e. inconsistent power functions, lighting changes to match tone but not time.My final gripe was the one point off. Robitnik is great. Jim Carrey nails the level of eccentricity. Its a different brand but similar level so good on you. The problem is the San Fran scene. Its not shown but any adult would notice that casual murder is implied. Robitnik  lack of care for other humans and the event on screen means people are dying and he has not remorse for it. I am not a parent but i believe that may just be a tad too far for a kids movie and is the only reason i did not give this a 10/10. All having been said, I loved it and you have me ready for a sequel"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Maybe it's far from reflecting the game, but still they made a great job to create such simple and delightful new story and friendly to watch scenario with really good actors.Im waiting impatiently for the second film :D"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Excellent movie, so glad they held off releasing it until it was done right. So much nostalgia. I really hope they continue the story!"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I loved it and I am waiting Sonic 2. The characters, the drama, everything was perfect."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I was amazingly surprised on this movie, it was very entertaining, actors were amazing including Ben my absolutely favorite, great sonic choice. Your kids and u will have a great time. I was at a birthday party today and kids were running like crazy trying to be Sonic, haven't seeing this since Elsa on Frozen 1"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I thought the movie was fantastic. I really wasn't sure what to expect after the whole redesign debacle, but they really nailed the look and feel for Sonic. It was fun, funny, and filled with plenty of little references for fans. My only criticism was they gave Sonic a little too much speed. He is basically the Flash (which is funny cuz there's a reference to the Flash), but it made for some entertaining scenes. If you're a fan of the games you def owe it to yourself to check it out.ps- I made a mc account just to review this"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "The movie was a great homage to the original Sega genesis games!  Lots of references to various memes about sonic.  Was definitely a smart idea for the studio to redesign him"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "i just watched the sonic movie. it was well worth the wait!  the great mixture of comedy action and emotional scenes made for an experience that i was totally not expecting. needless to say this is a great family movie and i thank jeff fowler for listening to us fans. loved the easter eggs and hints to some of the lore of the actual video game. some scenes were slow and a bit cringey but all in all the movie was a fantastic adaptation and i will be getting it on dvd and seeing the sequel!"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Funny, has that nostalgic moments from the iconic game, is filled with laughs and just plain old fun."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Good film to watch.

Although the side characters try their hardest. Jim Carry easily... Carries the movie on his back. A bit slow at times but throwing you right back into the action.

This was a fun family sc-fi movie we enjoyed all together. From the big to the little people in the family. Bad guys vs good guys and no weirdo identity politics.

Refreshingly a non devise film that was just family friendly fun."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Sonic the Hedgehog is one of my favorite movies of 2020. The visual effects were phenomenal especially Sonic and Dr. Robotnik's robots. I loved Sonic's design he was so cool and cute and a million times better than the original design. The acting from Jim Carrey and James Marsden was stupendous, Jim Carrey was better as Dr. Robotnik than I could have ever imagined. The writing was excellent, it was funny and touching. This was a great movie and one of my top 5 favorite video game adaption movies of all time."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Great script, great acting from the cast. The movie seems to be over too quickly (and that's a good movie in my books). Kudos for listening to fans about how Sonic (should) look (I grew up with Sonic on a Sega console). I loved to see how Jim Carrey relishes his role. I gotta say, though, the final boss fight was a bit underwhelming. Overall, a great family fun movie!"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Great Movie!
