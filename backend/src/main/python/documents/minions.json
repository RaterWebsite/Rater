There is nothing deep in this type of humor, so if you didn't like Minions and their jibber-jabber during the previous two installments, chances are you will find this ridiculous and/or annoying. For the fans, they should still find stuff to enjoy. Not to say that it could have been done much better and funnier, but still... Funniest stuff for me comes at the beginning (which was basically all the stuff from the trailers) and in the end, where I had some genuine LOL moments. The stuff in between is \"hit or miss\", but it was enough entertain me. The movie is not too long by today's standards, which is another plus."

      "text": "Minions is the prequel film that explains how the Minions came to be and how they met their master, Gru. Being a fan of the first 2 Despicable Me films, I was very hopeful that this would be good, but also very scared, because honestly, there's not enough substance to carry a whole film. Overall, it's not as good as the films before it, but it is still a nice addition to the franchise. I thought hearing just the minions for an hour and a half would get very tiresome, but they managed to make it work by adding human characters, while still keeping focus on the Minions. In this film we have an all-star cast that ranges from Sandra Bullock to Geoffrey Rush and Micheal Keaton. They all did a fine job at the rules they were given. I do have a few complaints with the film. It does seem to drag on a little bit but still manages to pick itself back up by the finale. A lot of the jokes were pointed towards kids, even more so than both Despicable Me, but the best jokes are the ones that kids may not get. There is a ton of references to 60's culture, and it's pretty cool to see something for the adults to enjoy.My biggest problem is that the story is really all over the place, It can't really stay focused on one thing for more than 10 minutes, and it gets a bit distracting. Overall, with a killer soundtrack and a ton of humor kids and adults will enjoy, even with the crumby story and a few flat jokes, Minions is still an enjoyable animated film, just not the best one this year."

I enjoyed the film for what it was, it's great if you just want to sit back and watch some slapstick. The weakest link though, is Scarlett Overkill. Her name is actually pretty fitting because she's too over-the-top and frankly, annoying. I mean, one minute her dress flaps like a normal dress and the next it's a cannon? Also there is only one place she could have put the missiles up there and you do not want to know where it is. But the Minions carry the movie surprisingly well, the movie is pretty enjoyable. Watch it for some laughs. It's better than they give it credit for."

The backstory part of the film is great, but the rest is just forgettable. Fortunately, the animation, set in the 1960s, is pretty good. Unfortunately, the plot is not good with uninteresting characters. In fact, this film is titled Minions, but it only focuses on three Minions. Also, the humor starts to get annoying this time around. I was disappointed with this prequel and Minions proves that the Despicable Me series has overstayed its welcome."

Sandra Bullock is good as the villain, and the minions are cute. Great lead up to Despicable Me and made sense as they couldn't keep a leader, but found Gru.

The animation is very good and the soundtrack is wonderfully interjected with some classic 60\u2019s songs. Also for the adult movie buffs in the audience there are plenty of references to other films one of which, if I\u2019m not mistaken, is a homage to \u2018The creature from the Black Lagoon\u2019? The villain here voiced by Sandra Bullock is the aptly titled Scarlet Overkill. However, the character lacks the sinister villainy of Despicable Me\u2019s \u2018Gru\u2019. I don\u2019t wish to be too harsh on the film because there are some truly inspired moments. The early narrated scenes depicting the Minions in search of the greatest villain they can find is a lot of fun as are the scenes at the Tower of London. Unfortunately, though, not being a true Minion convert I watched proceedings rather impassively laughing at only a couple of inspired sight gags. Ultimately, one is left to conclude that this is a film for children or diehard fans only."

The problem is a lack of engaging story-line, there were no real stakes to it.\r At the start of the film I was fairly amused but by middle I felt bored. If there had been another protagonist to focus on maybe that would have made things better. Like say a character who can actually speak English and who we could root for because the Minions alone can't carry this film. It's now abundantly clear that they belong in the background.\r Also there was nothing special about Scarlet Overkill. Gru at least was a distinctive character whereas Scarlet was the Strong Independent Woman that we have seen a million times before. So the film also failed in having a memorable villain.\r So basically if you are an adult and you still have retained your love for animated films then there is nothing for you here. It has a few fun bits here and there but nothing to recommend it for."

Give the people what they want! (Although I'm not sure this is quite what the people want. I didn't need to see a minion in a thong.)\r Centuries of young minion life has been shortened to a mere 90 minutes. We saw the best and the worst times, but still there was no real plot to speak of. The minions are funny (to a certain extent) and the movie did what one should expect it to do \u2013 have many banana-crazy minions running around every which way. That's what it does best and that's what I wish it would have focused on. Without a clear destination or point to the story, I was as lost as Bob and Stuart and Kevin were while trying to find their new supervillain.\r I didn't like Scarlet Overkill. I probably wasn't supposed to either, but that doesn't change the fact that she was an unreliable and one-dimensional character. I wanted to see the real Scarlet, not the power-hungry queen. Or maybe even see the minions stand up for themselves! I was disappointed with the story past their despair ice caves. I would have rather watched the minions in that cave for 90 minutes than watch the lifeless action sequence with the oddball villains that seemed strikingly out of place.\r Being a third sequel, I never had high expectations. This isn't Toy Story, and you're not going to cry. You'll laugh a couple times, cringe a few more, and walk out of the theater with a shrug.

But this film ticked most of the boxes needed for a good animation film. To start negatively, this film was rushed as f*ck. Honestly, scarlet overkill had just the worst build up to an antagonist I've ever seen in a movie. It was so quick and should've started with a little more context. Also, the action sequences were too rushed and should've had a more quick slapstick humour to them (i'm not saying they didn'y, but more would be nice). This being said, the comedy in this movie was exemplary as the minions are just too adorable in trying to understand a foreign world to them. The references to British pop culture in the 60's/70's were on point and added great comedic value to a film that means both children and adults will enjoy. Not the worst, but really not the best animated film out there."

Obviously you shouldn\u2019t be asking for much with a movie like that. But that shouldn\u2019t be an excuse for this film to be average. I really liked the first Despicable Me movie, and the second one was OK to me. (In my opinion, it didn\u2019t live up to it\u2019s predecessor). With \u201cMinions\u201d, I was cautiously optimistic.\r This movie made me think of another animated spin-off that came out a while ago, \u201cPenguins of Madagascar\u201d. They both suffer from similar issues. Both films feature the antics of (previously-supporting) cast members who mostly provided comic relief. While the minions just mess around and spout nonsense, there still was opportunity to maybe tell a story with them. Unfortunately, the filmmakers failed to do this as best as they could have.\r The Nelson family were an amusing bunch of characters, but I think their roles should\u2019ve been expanded. As they\u2019re the first humans Kevin, Stuart, and Bob meet, they should\u2019ve had more importance and influence on them. The minions are so impressionable, yet the Nelson\u2019s don\u2019t leave any lasting influence or mark? Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock) and her husband Herb are both fun characters, but neither of them are ever fully developed or made unique in any way. The minions themselves are what you\u2019d expect.\r The plot of the movie revolves around villains attempting to steal the Queen\u2019s crown. Herb\u2019s gadgets make this relatively easy, but if he had them all along, why didn\u2019t Scarlet use them to steal the crown earlier? She\u2019s very capable, but for some reason lets the minions do the work for her. Why?\r I think one of the main reasons this movie exists is to sell merchandise--particularly toys. \u201cMinions\u201d is ultimately a dumb, but harmless kid film. It doesn't live up to the first two Despicable Me movies. It's definitely not as good as Inside Out, which came out a few weeks ago. But if you want to watch it, I recommend renting it or seeing it on Netflix.\r I have reviewed 40 movies (on Metacritic and IMDB), some recent ones, including: Inside Out, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Fast and Furious 7, The Divergent Series: Insurgent, Taken 3, and more. I also review TV shows.\r Notes:\rThe minions\u2019 submissive nature and tendency to have a villainous master was actually a pretty interesting concept IMO. It had never occurred to me that the minions had actively sought out masters; in \u2018Despicable Me\u2019 they are all just shown to be employed by Gru and their origins are never really explained."

They stole the show in almost every scene they were in, and they were memorable and cute little sidekicks. However, too much of a good thing isn't necessarily a good thing, and the origin story for the Minions is the perfect example of that. Minions shows what those little bananas did before they met Gru as they journey to the International Supervillain Convention in 1968 and become henchmen to the world's most notorious villain, Scarlet Overkill. The issues with Minions are present from the very first scene and continue throughout the entire film. Much of the humor, as agonizing as this sounds, is supposed to come from the way the Minions talk. That wears out its welcome extremely quickly as you can imagine. Even the jokes that don't concern the Minions are reused numerous times throughout the film, making this movie tedious and repetitive. That could be somewhat forgiven if Minions had interesting characters or a compelling enough story, but unfortunately, this film has none of that. The Minions aren't exactly dramatic characters; they're always the sidekicks, destined to be overshadowed by the villains they serve. Even Scarlet Overkill is a fairly generic villain. She doesn't have any sort of special powers or a unique personality to distinguish herself from other power-hungry female villains. There's never any sort of drama or development with her character. Now onto the unfocused and rushed plot. If you have the attention span of a goldfish, you might find the plot of Minions to be fun, but anyone else will feel like they're being suffocated by the insanity of this film. This movie just never takes a break. There's never a moment where you can calm your senses from the insanity of the previous scene, and it's not because it's some action-packed spectacle. It seemed like the filmmakers were trying to fit as much as they possibly could into each scene so that much younger kids wouldn't be bored. Minions might entertain the least demanding moviegoers and their very young children, but anyone else should stay away from the contrived plot, tired jokes and dull characters littered throughout this movie."

      "text": "The minions are great sidekicks, and sometimes they have hit such hilarious moments in the despicable me franchise that it was hard to dislike them, they are such good characters for comedic effect. But for comedic effect only. They truly cannot carry their own film, and their repeated jokes and gags get rapidly boring, only appealing to the kind of audience who enjoys raunchy and mindless humour. And that is about everything I can say about minions, because this movie is stretched to such thin material, that I find no purpose in talking about story or character development or moral messages because there are none. I would recommend seeing this film if you are a die-hard fan of this franchise, because if you are not, chances are you will end up disliking this film. (P.S, I would not show this film to a kid younger than 6 years old, sometimes it crosses the line)"

      "text": "I thought the first two Despicable Me films were very enjoyable, but the highlight of both movies were the Minions. I thought they were hilarious. However, I thought they worked well as side characters, I didn't think they would be able to hold their own film. I still hold that opinion. Although the first two films were for families to enjoy, this one is for children. Your kids will laugh their faces off at this, but I don't think its as enjoyable for the parents. Sandra Bullock wasn't the greatest as the main antagonist, however Jon Hamm was a highlight in the film. I found him very entertaining in the role that he played, and he was the funniest thing in this movie. The main (Minion) characters, Stuart, Kevin and Bob were very entertaining, but most of it was slapstick humour you'll find funny the first time you watch it, probably not the next million times your kids chuck the DVD on (Kind of like the first Cars). I'll give the film credit, as its just a bit of harmless fun for the kids, but its not a great film in general. My final thoughts on this film are: Your kids will love it, but try to avoid buying it on DVD when it comes out, and avoid millions of viewings!"

The story was boring and the minions' language is now intelligible Spanish,Italian and English; it's as if there was no effort put into this movie. The minions were one of the best parts of the original Despicable Me films, but here they tried to give each one a personality and that just didn't work out, all of the characters were not memorable, I wouldn't have cared in they had all died, that would have done for a better story anyways."
