It has everything you good want: good acting, humor, spectacular action scenes, romance, and one of the best soundtracks ever created. Not to mention Geoffrey Rush and Johnny Depp acting together!

Bloom and Knightley make a poignant melodramatic piece to the film. It's authentic as it is ludicrous."

Also it became the signature role for Johnny Depp (Maybe both a curse and blessing for him). It has a great cast of characters that work well together and won me over easily as I was invested in them. Then there is the engaging story which takes the best from pirate movie themes and adds the titular Curse of the Black Pearl. Finally there is the humor that works so well. The introduction scene for Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow alone is hilariously funny. Lets start at the beginning. Pirates of the Caribbean was just an attraction in Disney theme parks before and I find it impressive that the project got green-lighted as the last true pirate films Pirates and Cutthroat Island failed while there were just a few attempts in the years before. There are many individual stories or motives of the characters combined into the story. Often these collide or align. Captain Jack Sparrow wants his ship the Black Pearl back and revenge on those who mutinied. Will Turner wants to win the heart of his sweetheart and more out of live. Elisabeth Swan wants more than being what society expects from females and Captain Barbossa and his crew want something I cant spoil. I like how the story unfolds and the twist are great. All characters have relatable and believable motivations and backstories that work well too. I like how the story and characters improve each other as it is interwoven well. It gets also the sweet spot with being serious and having great humor without weakening each other. The curse spices up this movie too. Then there are the actors. I already mentioned Jack Sparrow became Johnny Depps signature role. He impressed critics and fans alike. There is nearly no one who does not have heard of Captain Jack Sparrow. Then we have Orlando Bloom as William Turner who also become a character that easily won me over. So relatable with human flaws but also good hero material. With Keira Knightly as Elizabeth Swan we got actual a strong independent woman who does not want to be chained by expectations and society. She is strong willed, capable and can fend for her own in most situations. With Captain Hector Barbossa by the great Geoffrey Rush we got a great antagonist. He is an interesting character and strong adversary. Great main cast but it ends not there as I want to praise Kevin R Mc Nally, Jack Davenport and Jonathan Pryce as much as the two comic relive pirates that appear in all 3 movies of the trilogy (Forgot their names so shame on me). It has overall an excellent cast that fully delivers. It ends not there as the special effects were amazing. It looked so good back then and holds up and I am nearly ashamed that I cant go into details because of spoilers. The sets are the same. Everything looks natural and believable form ports, ships and towns to weapons and costumes. They took great care to deliver an atmosphere that captures the audience. Of cause I must mention the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and Klaus Badelt. Hans Zimmer is a legend and Klaus Badeld is underappreciated in the business and together they delivered a great performance that is praised and cherished by many. Overall this became a surprise hit, started a franchise that still continues and is worth watching without doubt."

One night, with the gold medallion she carries around her neck, she gets captured by the pirates aboard the Black Pearl by the evil Barbossa who is using her to get the cave to find the treasure. However, the whole pirate crew is immortal due to the medallion and can turn into skeletons. With the help of a young man named Will Turner, Jack and his other crew members plan to save Elizabeth and put an end to Barbossa's reign once and for all.\r Wow. I was thrilled when I caught the screening of this in July of 2003 that I have one word to say about it and the word is: FANTASTIC!!! Johnny Depp was very hilarious as Jack Sparrow and he was a very good actor. Orlando Bloom (for some reason, was in the third LOTR movie, which came out at the exact same year this movie did) did very well as Will Turner, Kiera Knightley (from King Arthur) was so cool as Elizabeth Swann and she was so freaking hot! Geoffrey Rush was very frightening, yet entertaining as Captain Barbossa and the rest of the actors did very well at their performances.\r The CGI was pretty cool and even the action scenes were so cool. The storyline was well-paced and the cinematography was great.\r There is nothing negative to say about this film, so I am in good hands.\r Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is an excellent Disney pirate adventure based on the popular ride from DisneyWorld and one of the best movies ever made from the early 2000s.\r 8/10"

      "text": "A blockbuster in every way, The Curse of the Black Pearl is a perfect start to a massively grossing franchise that is still going, flawed but definitely enjoyable, much more than a film based on a theme park ride should have been.\rJohnny Depp creates a character that will undoubtedly be one of if not the most iconic of all his roles, Captain Jack Sparrow, don't forget the 'Captain' part, he won't like that. A man famous for us often personal and more bizarre roles has created one of the most memorable and comic characters we have seen, and to top it all off, he's a pirate.\rSet in the midst of the age of the cutlass-wielding treasure hunters, Jack lands in Port Royal where inadvertently saves the Governors daughter, Elizabeth Swan (Kiera Knightley). He somewhat befriends blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) who sets out with him to capture the infamous Black Pearl, a ship run by the dead who have been cursed after stealing the wrong sort of treasure.\rThe set-pieces are explosive and the dialogue is a homage to the age the film is set in. There is quite a reliance on humour, which pays off in many aspects throughout the film but at other points can fall short of its target, the two high points of this being Jack Sparrow himself played uniquely by Depp, bringing his very own take and charisma to the character, and Geoffrey Rush who plays the Captain of the Black Pearl, Barbosa, whose confident and grumbled Irish accent and command of the screen, along the unfortunately limited screen time himself and Depp share together, make up very dark and witty humour throughout.\rThe heart of the film is lead by Knightley and Bloom who have a blossoming romance on the cards, their scenes can be a little dramatic for the theme of the film, and more time should have been spent getting to know these pirates more, but take the good with the bad I suppose.\rOf course the true brand of the film is that of Jack Sparrow, his mumbling and comedic quips with those surrounding him are electrifying through the talent of Depp, and while the supporting cast are on sound form, he truly steals the show, along with quite the satisfying finale that of course opened all sorts of doors. The film is quite remarkable in the sense of its emergence from nothing, but I suppose if Ron Howard takes inspiration from paintings, a theme park ride is bound to be a creative playground."

It reminds me of the old Marx Brothers films: if not for Groucho, Chico, and Harpo, they would be bland and nobody would care, but thanks to Jack Sparrow  who seems to incorporate the best elements of all three  the movie ends up fantastically entertaining. Will Turner may be the protagonist by any helpful analysis of story structure, but Jack is the reason you're watching, and he's well worth it.\r The Curse of the Black Pearl has a solid, familiar-yet-surprising story at its heart, that never loses sight of where it's going next. This is part of what makes it good: you can guess roughly where it's going next, and have your expectations confirmed, but there's always some surprise complication waiting for you when you get there, so you're never bored. One of the best Disney movies of the 2000s, and well worth seeing by anyone."
