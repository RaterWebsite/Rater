The soundtrack is delightful surprise, and whilst it's not a perfect film, the humour and performances make this a wonderfully fun experience. 8.47/10"}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Rough Night focuses more on the comedy than on the story. It isn't safe to say that story is more important than comedy, but in a genre that is in the comedy section, a story is arguably needed. Basic instructions of a movie is to make a story that at least feels like a great ride on a roller coaster. In this case, they failed to give much to the story by giving the comedy more than expected. Great on paper, terrible on screen."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "This is the female cross between \"Weekend at Bernie's\" and \"The Hangover.\"  Five friends (Scarlett Johansson, Kate McKinnon, Jillian Bell, Ilana Glazer, and Zo\u00eb Kravitz) travel to Miami for a wild bachelorette weekend. The hilarity is supposed to get complicated when they accidentally kill a stripper, but that's not the case. Despite the non-stop spunky energy and potentially comic situations, there's not much genuinely funny. McKinnon turns in an enjoyably wacky performance, while Bell is like Melissa McCarthy\u2026a little of her bluster goes a long way\u2026and there's LOTS of it here. The whole night is amusing to watch, but more jokes die than land. NOTE: McKinnon has an amusing song DURING the credits and Bell drops a plot surprise AFTER the credits."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Some of the dumbest characters in the history of cinema, makes up this below average comedy. I got a few chuckles here and there, but with Girls Trip out the same year it shows the flaws with this film. Also when I say dumbest I mean dumbest. D"}, {"rating": "1", "text": "Charm. Its a useful ingredient, like salt. There is none in this movie. Utterly, totally, completely none. As the negativity piles up and up and up, nothing breaks it. No laughs, no sweetness, no character development. Nada. How do put ScarJo on screen and not be fascinated? This movie answer that question."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "Really, really, really bad movie. Weak script, forced acting, with a spattering of funny lines. Kate McKinnon couldn't even save it, and frankly was not used as much as she could have been."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "The cast is attractive and dedicated, but only Johansson and Kravitz are consistent. Bell, Glazer and especially McKinnon (sporting a very annoying Australian accent) are very hit and miss, all too often ending a joke too soon or dragging it on for too long. The whole film feels like the rough draft of a great black comedy, but it ends up just being a bunch of missed opportunities."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Well, I liked it. It's not perfect, but I did find it fun even if every joke wasn't laugh-out-loud. I'd consider buying it. The first third before the death is the weakest part. The weakest jokes dominate this segment. Also, the character traits and their paths are all obvious, I admit this. But after it hits the fan, things get crazy. Things get increasingly insane throughout. Watching the characters panic and act weird was entertaining. As always, Kate McKinnon steals the show as the oddest one."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Easily one of the most underrated films of the summer. I laughed pretty consistently throughout. The supporting actors killed me - esp Ty Burrell and Demi Moore destroyed."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "There is some talent in this movie, but the script and writing are just terrible. The film is a mixture of drunken bachelorette tropes mixed with bachelor party tropes. Hey they accidentally kill a stripper at the party. Their attempts to deal with the dead body are stolen from Very Bad Things and Weekend and Bernies. The director/writer Lucia Aniello also has to throw in some man bashing and ham fisted feminism. The male characters in the movie as emasculated, effeminates who oh and ah over wine tastings. The other men are criminals. There is also a plot of two of the friends being former lesbian lovers who reunite. Perhaps all of the flaws could be overlooked if you gave a **** about any of the women. Only Kate McKinnon's character is even remotely likable and brings the most humor to the group. The rest of them are selfish, egotistical, jerks. They also never get any sort of comeuppance. Their multiple murders just get washed away with some hand waving and everything keeps going. There is no remorse, no real growth, no humor. Thumbs down."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Let me be perfectly clear.  This is a terrible movie that has a couple of laughs.  Some of it is so stupid, I had to laugh at how stupid it was.  Everything is way over the top.  The performances aren't bad, but the dialogue is middle school and the plot is ridiculous.  I asked the ladies I was with what they would give this movie on a scale of 1 - 5.  Four of them gave it a 1.  I gave it a 2 and one other gave it a 3.  Usually when critics hate a movie, users like it.  But, this one seems to be universally disliked.  Be advised.  Wait to see it when it comes to Netflix or DVD."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Wouldn\u2019t be nice if there was an American mainstream comedy \u2013 you know, one of those dirty ones, resembling, say, \u201eThe Hangover\u201c \u2013 but with girls instead of guys?I mean, all-girls remakes are getting quite hot right now, 2016\u2019s \u201eGhostbusters\u201c gathered nearly 230 million dollars \u2013 probably not enough to turn profit, probably, but still. Also, there\u2019s \u201eOcean\u2019s Eight\u201c coming in June 2018, and we could capitalize on this by producing a quick comedy right now, yes? \u201eColossal\u201c garnered good reviews too, so what\u2019s not to like, eh?All we need is some sweet but sexy star on the lead \u2013 I know, Scarlett Johansson can do it, she is only the most profitable actress on the planet now but still so down to earth and everything, and I bet she would like to do something quick and fun between all those superhero projects.Oh yeah, we need four more girls\u2026 How about a*\u201ekind of fat but kind of pretty\u201c one,* token \u201eblack but not too black\u201c one (played by the daughter of Lenny Kravitz, no less!) that every mainstream comedy needs,* Australian one so we can make fun of her accent,* and the edgy one, because what we\u2019re doing is so edgy, right, girls? Of course it is.So the producers had everything they wanted. It surely means that the result is something cool because having girls instead of guys is surefire way to comedy heaven already, no?Well\u2026 no. \u201eRough Night\u201c sucks. It\u2019s the second suckiest movie I\u2019ve seen this year, right after the sequel to \u201e50 Shades\u201c. Don\u2019t be tempted by more or less OK trailer, the movie\u2019s bad.They don\u2019t have almost anything that we enjoy about this kind of raunchy comedy. No inspiration, no decent acting (everybody feels tired, uninspired and/or just not funny), no good vibe, chemistry or flow between players.I didn\u2019t even laugh once which is really rare for me when I watch a mainstream dirty American comedy. I am a bit of a fan of the genre.If you endure the whole movie, you may want to check out the two additional scenes in the end, the first during the credits, the other one after them. The second one is not bad, actually, and paves way for a possible sequel. Not that you\u2019d need one, or the box office results encourage now.Oh yeah, I remembered something. There is actually one pretty cool thing about \u201eRough Night\u201c \u2013 the unexpected appearance by certain former female star and current star of the popular sitcom \u201eModern Family\u201c.But they don\u2019t have enough screen time to justify the ticket price or 101 minutes of your life."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Irresponsibly shows this hip young ladies engaged in perverse harmful behaviors.

Yet it is hard to ignore them from watching. So I watched it not expecting anything special out of it. And I did not get any. But... it was okayish. Moreover, Scarlett Johansson was the main reason I wanted to watch it. You can't always do superhero, action films. This is something offbeat. Often need to take this path, no to fail miserably, but to relax from the mainstream. So this was enjoyable, but not by all.It is like the female version of 'Hangover'. Five friends go to Miami for one of theirs bachelorette party. It's supposed to be fun without any rules, but a disaster strikes in the early and makes them to cover all the evidence. The night turns their worst nightmare ever. How they manage to come out of it are the remaining film that revealed with a twist at the end.The reception was as expected, but it was not that bad if you are seeking only a timepass. It ended like there could be a sequel, but now it seems very unlikely. One of the issues with the film is it was so traditional narrative. With so many jokes repeated from other flicks. The majority won't approve that. As far as I think it is watch and forget kind of film. An average film.
