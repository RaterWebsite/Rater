Kill them immediately god forbid they might start mansplaining or something. (Also why does Mr. Fantastic state Dr. Strange is from Earth-616? That is the comic book continuity not the MCU which is Earth-199999. Seriously Marvel you can't keep that straight how do you expect fans to?)Step 6: have the crappy character defeat the main villain for our hero because she couldn't control her powers but Dr. Strange gave her a pep talk so shes good to go now! Also defeat is a strong word more like show her the error of her ways or some BS.Step 7: Profit???? At least until you've sucked every last drop out of the superhero teet and the audience stops coming because all the characters they love have been pasted over by the newer woker versions.

It's a movie that is hard to take seriously. The dialogue and the way it's delivered especially when trying to take itself seriously is laughable.

The assassination of the character wanda was done really bad, especially coming from wandavision.

What we got was moronic, with plot driven contrivances being the main plot device.  There is little, if any continuity within the movie.  I am sure if the original footage was not intentionally deleted, the Raimi cut will be far better than this garbage.
