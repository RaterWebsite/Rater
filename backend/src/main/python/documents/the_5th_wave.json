A teenage girl abandoned by her parents, five threatening waves, one brother to the rescue, and a couple of guys to fall in love. \"The 5th Wave\" is an adaption of the book of the 2013 written by Rick Yancey. Its main protagonist is the talented and beautiful Chloe Moretz as Cassie Sullivan,  a high school student who is threatened by one group called \"The Others \", she will need to survive in a dystopian world full of dangerous and enemies for one reason his younger brother. Director J Blakeson returns to be in the director's Chair and possibly create a successful and profitable franchise, emphasizing the script created by Jeff Pinkner, Susannah Grant and Akiva Goldsman that gives light to the atmosphere so off.\r In the beginning, the character played by Chloe (Cassie) is the kind of good American girl cliche of some films.  She attends a party up to certain time because her parents are home, loves his brother and sing you a song of good night, it's the same again.  This middle class girl suffers a rapid transformation process, it all begins with the arrival of the aliens.\r Appears momentarily the first wave, a pulse electromagnetic which leaves the town in shock. With a surprising and boring short duration each wave dismantling quickly, each with a duration of about 3 minutes, missed the potential that It had the introduction of the phases. Floods, tsunamis and tidal waves attack the world, establishing a short but sexy scene of Cassie escape and her brother.\r The third phase is the flu, and shows us the introduction of characters with short duration and unnecessary (Cassie best friend) used only to create a dramatic scene, the same thing again.\r As it was logical her family seek refuge after harrowing moments. The girl has to deal with horrible things (deaths, falls, lost, pains and all that stuff) but the worst is what gives way to the plot of the film, the abduction of her brother.\r The training of the young soldiers is very similar to the tone in \"Kingsman: The Secret Service\", taking refuge in a room for everyone and subjecting them to harsh tests.  The performance of Maika Monroe (Ringer) was quite successful and arguably is one of the young promises next to Chloe Moretz who truly have the honor to be called \"actresses\".\r They have arrived and the plot twist of a discovery is maintained in a stable limit, being predictable for some but unimaginable to others. So finally the 5th wave happens, and the argument starts during this.\r Walk through the dangerous forest with a gun makes see a totally powerful Lady and is on the road where it meets the twin \"Four\" ( The Divergent Series) Evan Walker (Alex Roe) a survivor with secrets who is madly in love with Cassie.\r The work of Sam Sullivan (Zackary Arthur) is as to the height of the roles of older people, can tell no difference with his companions, this boy have future.\r \"The 5th wave\" might be more successful if its producer Sony would have expected a little more of time, when the really interesting sagas like \"Divergent\" or \"Maze Runner\" had finished and the hungry young people will ask for new franchises. But they didn't , and now it seems to be an almost exact copy of its competitors. This film was not disappointing, but this was not the best time for Cassie."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Everything about 'The 5th Wave' is very middle of the road. It isn't exactly a bad movie but nor is it one I would go out of my way to suggest people should go and see. A major problem with the film is the lack of originality in its narrative. As you watch it you start to see where the story of the film is going from a mile off, turning intended plot twists into confirmed predictions. Now this isn't to say that the film doesn't have entertaining moments, it does, but with the narrative being so by the numbers, the general flow of the film (particularly when it reaches the second act) starts to grind and become less engaging. A positive aspect for the film is the cast, in particularly Chloe Moretz (Kick Ass) who delivers a lot more range than any of her previous works, and takes to the lead role rather well. Considering this is the first movie of a planned trilogy and although I found it overall to be quite underwhelming, I would still like to watch the sequel as I can see there is potential, although perhaps that's more in the young actors rather than the film itself."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "The 5th Wave doesn't deliver, but it doesn't disappoint. The movie throughout is dull, and it tries too hard to bring in action and suspense. Good concept, but bad delivery."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "I went and saw this movie because Zootopia was sold out. From what I'd seen on the trailers, it looked like another Hunger Games/Divergent. I was right. I watched another female protagonist deal with family issues as she stumbled through the forest alone with nobody that could help her. Until, of course, she met a boy that she originally didn't like until she saw him bathing in a river. It was arguably better than most movies of its kind, however, given that it had some moments that actually made me cry. However, the part before \"the first wave\" was cheesy, a classic red-solo cup party with drama about a boy she liked. That part felt forced and awkward, probably because the director hasn't lived as a teenager today- understandable. The duration of the film in the first four waves was emotional and devastating, major props for that. However, aside from a few good scenes, everything else following that was much worse. Between flat characters (the \"agressive one\", the \"kid that needs protected\", the \"smart one\"), another plot where the teenagers have more power/skills than adults (probably meant to make teenagers feel empowered), and a rushed romance, the movie felt flat from a beginning that could have separated it from other movies of its type."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Fairly cliche and often painstakingly boring. Chloe Moretz is awful here. I often wonder how book-to-movie adaptations such as this one go so wrong..."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "The 5th Wave dosen't disappoint. It was really-really good! The story was quiet excellent, really. But the only bad aspect of the movie was, for it's small \"Teen Drama Scene\" moments, and the s----y ending (no worries, I wont say a damn thing) Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz performance was really-really good, and so other actors... It wasn't really bad, actually. Just those parts I mention earlier... :D"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Loved it! It was a great YA movie!

It grabs you and won't let you go until the credits end. It is hauntily gripping. I don't know what the critics saw, but it sure wasn't the 5th wave. The 5th wave takes a new form of YA adapations.

The film in whole is a trill joy ride. The actions in this film is amazing. Seeing the waves coming alive is hauting. Don'tpay any minds to critics; they don't know anything.

From the first scene, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Chloe Grace Moretz was fantastic in this film as well as her boyfriend. I felt like there were some pretty good intense disaster sequences and the film just went really well. The plot is a bit predictable and the last 30 minutes were pretty slow, but that first hour just really blew me away. Most of the people who say this movie is bad or at least not entertaining probably didn't go see the film, because the film might have its flaws but everyone must admit they were entertained for at least a small bit. I've never read the book, and I probably won't but I'm dying to see if they make a sequel."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Who do you trust when all humanity is lost? That is the basic theme of The 5th wave. Based on the first book of a planned trilogy, the present world is being invaded by aliens, eliminateing the human race with 5 waves. The last remaning humans are divided: Some are left alone to fight to surivive, some are taken in by the gorvement to form an elite group to take back their world, and some are taking by the \"others\". Cassie's little brother is taken by the others and it is up to her to save him.  Cassie is a stong female character, which makes the movie enjoyable. Chole does a great job of bring Cassie to life. Before going to see the movie, I thought I was not going to enjoy it becase it was other Hunger Games and Divergent, but I was wrong. I enjoy this movie; It has it's own twist and stands on it own. The action scenes are amazing and gripping. It has everything for the male and female audience."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "My son had mentioned me to see this movie, I really thought it would not surprise me let alone please me , but I actually found the fantastic movie without unnecessary dialogues and without much ado , I loved a lot and recommend it to everyone!"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Shows an alien invasion a little different from what we have seen in Spielberg 's films for example, is not just explosions and advanced technology, has something else behind , say it's a very well-planned strategy , I particularly found a resemblance to \" the host \" as the long aliens, were parasites, but only that it reminded me of something that happened in another film and the course of the film to see a bit of clich\u00e9 teen movies , but that does not diminish the movie , I promise to be a long VERY good and the sequence to be better, that defects will be corrected ."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This movie has a very good argumentation and very good special effects ( if we don't count gunshots that are horrible ).

That is being biased. Just becasue it is other YA, dosen't mean it's bad. YA is a type of genre; just like comedy and action.The 5th wave has a great stroy, the  actions are mindblowing and well done, the special effects are good. The strong female lead is what drives the stroy forward, which Chloe dose a great job. The Waves coming alive on screen is hauntingly. GIve this movie a chance and watch it.

While most YA novels/movies are set in a future dystopian society, the 5th wave is set in present time with invasions coming in 5th waves to eliminate the human race.

After the \"others\" take Cassie's, played by Chloe Grace Moretz, brother,she is set to look for him. Along the way, she meets Evan Walker who joins her to look for her brother, but somwthings not right with Evan. Is he one or the others or one of the last remaing human?

Not to be happy that the 5th wave has come to earth, because it is scary has heck. As a matter of fact, Waves 1-4 is shockingly terrifying, but that what makes the film adaptation gripping. To see the waves come alive on the big screen is terrifying. The actions scenes are best as it gets; it mix with war, surviving combat, and lets not forget about the waves, which will haunt you.

It is a true adaptation that will grab you and won't let you go."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "When I saw the trailer of this movie I thought it would be a median action movie, but no! the actions scenes are horrible, the characters are all stereotyped, the scenes are totally predictable, and even in the end of the world the main concern is: which boy will the girl choose? it's like a twilight saga in the end of the world.
