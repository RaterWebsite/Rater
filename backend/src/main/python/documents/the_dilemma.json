It could have easily taken the cheap way out as with so many other comedies these days with crass sophomoric humor to illicit approval from the audience.  Instead it went for a more mature approach with comedy as an afterthought.  Unfortunately it came up short in terms of resonating with me.  Vince Vaughan did an admirable job as an individual tortured by being unsure as to what is the right thing to do.  I disagree that this was his typical role.  Not far removed but more of a stretch than I have seen in the past.  Jennifer Connelly was fine as was Winona Ryder.  Interesting to see Winona in a few movies lately. Kevin James does not yet allow me to think of him as a character other than Kevin James.  Who knows if that will ever change.  Bottom line is a B+ for effort but a C+ for execution."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Throughout the second phase of his career, the one which started with 1977's \"Grand Theft Auto\", this former child star, hardly what you would call a critics' darling, has consistently assuaged the mainstream audience's fear of adventure with sturdy, but ultimately, disposable films that never go, you know, there; the proverbial there, the dark place where many provincial-minded moviegoers are afraid to go.This filmmaker, for better or worse, is Middle America's Orson Welles. His most successful outing, the Academy Award-winning \"A Beautiful Mind\", well-received for its adeptness at showing the inner-workings of John Nash's compromised world, disappointingly settles for cheap sentiment during the final reel(for starters, the pen scene), and ends up making the schizophrenic game theorist entirely too sympathetic, by half. Love him or loathe him, that's the filmmaker's modus operandi: placate the audience, placate 'em good, which is why his latest effort, \"The Dilemma\", in many ways, represents a radical departure for this pathological crowd-pleaser, who as a result of his gallivanting into uncharted territory, may shock his core audience by showing off a previously incognito dark side. Nobody's going to confuse this former child star with a misanthrope like Lars Von Trier, but his foray into pessimism as a filmic tool is a new development in the ol' repertoire that deserves our encouragement, not scorn. Case and point: the off-kilter toast that Ronnie(Vince Vaughn) gives at his girlfriend's parent's anniversary party, albeit not possessing the same caliber of black humor as the damning speech given by a sexually-abused son to his depraved stepfather in Thomas Vinterberg's \"Festen\", does take you aback, does make you hold your breath a little, as the crazed entrepreneur, vexed over the infidelity perpetuated by Geneva(Winona Ryder), his best friend's wife, expounds upon the concept of honesty, and keeps both audiences(us and the partygoers) on pins and needles, as he speculates over other people's sex lives with his vitriol-fueled stand-up patter. When you consider that our answer to the Dogme movement(which includes the 1998 Vinterberg film, also known as \"The Celebration\") was Alan Cummings' \"The Anniversary Party\", maybe \"The Dilemma\", through its seeming allusion to more cineaste-approved fare, is the squarest of all square filmmaker's concession that his proficient movies are indeed maddeningly middle-of-the-road. \"The Dilemma\" is virgin territory for this talented hack; it's, at times, genuinely edgy. In its own oblique way, this Dogme-light comedy is a very political film; it's anti-bromance. Unlike the Judd Apatow-inspired \"I Love You, Man\", the close bond between Ronnie and Nick(Kevin James), inventors of a new technology that masculinizes the electric car, has none of the coyness surrounding their friendship that runs through \"Superbad\" and \"Pineapple Express\". When we learn that Ronnie had sex with Geneva(at Ball State, wink wink, nudge nudge), their sexual history, as a result, has a transformative effect on previous scenes, especially the one at the botanical garden, because now it's a former lover, and not just the best friend of the husband whom Geneva is cuckolding, who watches a whole lot of sinning going on between the secret lovers, in the thick of the rare fauna and flora. The contact that Ronnie makes with the poisonous greenery, in retrospect, no longer plays like an arbitrary occurrence; his falling down, not just a harmless bit of slapstick comedy resulting in a bad rash and urinary problems, but instead takes on the significance of a punishment, the transgression being: he covets his best friend's wife. This game-changing revelation at the coffeehouse, which codifies Ronnie's sexual orientation, culminates with Geneva feigning a good cry and corroborating story about Ronnie's ongoing lechery, which she threatens to deploy as a preventive measure against being found out. Her public display of female hysteria uncannily recalls the scene in Rob Reiner's \"When Harry Met Sally\" where Meg Ryan fakes an orgasm. This time, it's crocodile tears. The premise that women and men can't truly be friends because of each sex's biological disposition toward f*cking, is retold in \"The Dilemma\" under the guise of a man's fidelity toward a committed homosocial relationship with an old college buddy. Forty-years-old and never married, Ronnie dated and dumped all of Geneva's friends because none of them were Geneva herself. For a change of pace, \"The Dilemma\" has a straight subtext. In \"Vanilla Sky\", Julie Gianni(Cameron Diaz) says, \"Don't you know that when you sleep with someone, your body makes a promise whether you do or not.\" When Ronnie sees Geneva kissing that guy, his body remembers, and more importantly, he remembers."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "What Howard has here is a film that follows the genre...so far, beats about the bush a bit further, digresses toward a flash of intrigue, then falls straight on its face---leaving a hefty rash of deep-rooted 'botanical' dissatisfaction. \"The Dilemma\" is nothing more than a rom-com filled with the usual paranoia, speculation, sex, lies, and melodrama---the only difference---the PG-13 rating decided to lose its diapers. What transpires is a miss-matched, unconvincing, uninteresting concoction of a recurringly flat and soporific Vince Vaughn-meets-Mall Cop-meets Deeds-soap opera that takes an earnestly darker and contemplative approach to heartbreak.

I was expecting the usual goofy crap that these two (Vaughn & James) are usually in, but it was much better.

Ryder and Connelly were truly regulated to back seats in this piece but they rode quite well.  This isn't or wasn't intended to be some slap stick roll on the floor grab your sides slap stick crap.  Ron Howard had a story and a dilemna he wanted to explore and he did it well.

The only good thing about this film is Vince Vaughan and Kevin James acting because i like them from other comedy films. The problems with this film is the story isnt balance, some scenes feel like there going onto difeerent episodes and that wasent good, the film was barelly funny at all and the actors could have done a better job on the characters but they didnt. I would not watch this film again."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "For a movie with two popular comedians, it wasn't very funny. The parts that were intended to be humorous were so randomly distributed, it was impossible to laugh. Queen Latifa's character was a complete mess. What on earth was she doing in this movie? Her presence in a film is so strong, her character needs to have more relevance to the plot or it just becomes bizarre. Not to mention everything out of the woman's mouth was pornographic. This movie is (I'm guessing, because the plot was almost absent) about people cheating on each other while one guy nearly gets himself killed trying to \"fix\" everything. Of course the female adulterer gets all the heat while the slime ball who attends weekly sex sessions at a massage parlor is victimized.  Vaughn becomes a human punching bag for trying to rescue his friends failed marriage while nearly destroying his relationship with a dumb, unrealistically patient girlfriend.. Ryder's character was incredibly dark. In one scene, she starts foaming at the mouth in a way you'd expect from some kind of psychopathic bunny killer in a Life Time movie. I found myself thinking \"Does she think shes in Black Swan again?\" Then of course there's the Queen talking about her female erections in a car lot two minutes later. It was hard to like any of the people in this movie. The only \"innocent\" character was a complete bore and all of the side characters were forgettable.  I did enjoy a fight scene involving a broken fish tank and flaming hair spray. Only because it was the most exciting thing I'd seen since i saw the disk tray pop out of my computer prior to the movie starting.  The Dilemma ended in the same nonsensical pattern, a mixture of predictability and disorganization. Including the most annoying words ever spoken by a human being (Vaughn) just before a very stereotypical bro-mantic frolic on an ice rink. I actually felt embarrassed for the stars of this film. I'm surprised that any one likes it. I want my dollar back from red box."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "A few chuckles here and their, it's sad how stale the plot is considering the entire movie revolves heavily around it, Vince Vaughn is okay in the movie and he makes the \"dilemma\" a bit believable, but Kevin James bombs in this, overacting in almost all his lines and his jokes are incredibly boring."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Vince Vaughn is talented when it comes to fast talking improve and Kevin James can bring the funny most of the time, so it seems like a great idea to bring them together to make a film.

There is a decent movie lying in there somewhere, it just never gets to it.    The idea for this movie is interesting enough; I just think in the end, The Dilemma does not live up to the possibility of good the idea shoots for.

Ron Howard is not new to comedy territory(Splash for example)and in my opinion he manages to entertain the audience.The movie boasts really hilarious moments and good reflections on friendship and marriage with a light tone that is natural for comedy.Even if there are few predictable aspects I enjoyed the movie for what it is.I think that critics and audience missed the point because I've seen not so much good comedies about that. Vince Vaughn is the heart and the soul of the movie.I found him really good and I believe that he is an underrated actor.They should give him more opportunities to show his abilities. Kevin James is adequate to his role that is not too demanding. Jennifer Connelly has a pointless role as the Ronnie's girlfriend.Don't get me wrong.I think she is a really amazing actress and she plays well here.But her role is a bit useless except her mission to make Ronnie a more honest man about what's happening . Winona Ryder has the juiciest and the more complex role as the cheating wife.She was exceptional and mesmerizing.She proved why she deserves to be still today a leading actress and not to be pushed only in supporting roles and little parts. She embodies not a stereotyped character but a selfish,occasionally nasty but with a soul within the surface woman.I hope this will be a comeback for her. So good story, good direction, good script and a perfect cast.My vote is 7/10"}, {"rating": "2", "text": "A promising premise that fails to capture its potential at all whatsoever.

It should not have been a movie, because it's a PG-13 style Disney channel movie."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "This movie didn't impress me, it didn't really seem to 'go anywhere'. Under an hour into the movie and I was waning. The plot didn't seem particularly strong, I was left wondering when the main story would actually develop to be honest - Vinces character (Ronny) comes across as rather arrogant and thus not very nice, while James' character (Nick)  is a little obnoxious, so neither particularly interested me. I don't know what it is that seems to make me want to watch most if not all movies Kevin James is in - they practically all seem to end up being a disappointment to me, yet I really liked him in the sitcom TV show King of Queens. This movie seemed to lack direction and came across as rather bland and disinteresting, with probably only the one character that particularly stood out, that being Susan Warner, played by fiesty actress/rapper Queen Latifah, who works for Dodge and see's big potential for Ronny and Nick working for the company. She is quite amusing with some saucy dialogue whereby she demonstrates her faith in them in a rather over the top fashion, as we'd expect from that actress.The boys' partners seem rather petty and generally I didn't feel it grabbed me at all. I didn't feel that there was much there to really grab my attention and make me want to concentrate on what was going on as the plot felt so weak, so im not sure what else I can say to be honest. I was a little surprised that this film only has a 12 rating, given some of the saucier dialogue as well as the odd semi-nude scene, although there's nothing extremely graphic.Maybe im being unfair and I think in the past had I seen this movie I'd be put off reviewing it as there isn't much that springs to mind to comment on it but then again reviews should say what you think and its a bit biased or whatever the right term would be(?) to only post reviews on movie you think are decent to great. I suppose its true that im easily distracted and I probably didn't concentrate on the dialogue etc. as I perhaps should have and instead ended up checking my phone for messages and doing other things but then I've managed to  become engrossed in other movies and wanted to concentrate on them and enjoy them but it wasn't the case with this film.Apart from Kevin James and Vince Vaughn who provide most of the appeal for the movie probably and kudos to them in that the performances given are decent enough, its more the script to blame but i can't say that I thought the acting was entirely wooden as such...anyway, other stars present in this film include Winona Ryder and Jennifer Connelly who play the boys wives and Channing Tatum, so the cast offers some potential. There are two scenes or parts of the movie that are semi-memorable but only for being a bit daft to be honest, its certainly not a belly laugh type comedy  (noting that this is supposed to be a comedy, most of the comedy is probably hidden in the dialogue but I was rather bored so didn't pick up on some/most of, I'd imagine).Funnily enough, no I wouldn't recommend this - I found it too dull for my liking, not very engrossing at all."}], "recommendations": ["no_strings_attached", "that_awkward_moment", "trainwreck", "logan_lucky", "the_break_up", "friends_with_benefits", "central_intelligence", "tammy", "the_spy_who_dumped_me", "legally_blonde", "bad_teacher", "seven_psychopaths", "forgetting_sarah_marshall", "this_means_war", "lucky_number_slevin", "the_boss", "the_nice_guys", "wanderlust", "burn_after_reading", "the_five_year_engagement", "the_cobbler", "a_bad_moms_christmas", "blockers", "silver_linings_playbook", "the_king_of_staten_island"]}
