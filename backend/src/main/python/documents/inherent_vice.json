T. Anderson is an amazing director, I wasn't sure how successful he would be adapting Thomas Pynchon to the big screen. Mr. Anderson did not disappoint. He does a great job of capturing the stoned vibe, weirdness, and zaniness of the novel. There is a lot in the book that didn't make it into the movie, but it would have been next to impossible to jam all of the book's plot in there. I'm grateful that Mr. Anderson decided to adapt this novel because Mr. Pynchon's weirdness is definitely compatible with the director's style. The cinematography is wonderful. The pacing is just right for the source material: I felt hypnotized by the dialogue - I actually felt stoned after the movie was over. Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Doc Sportello is a comedic tour de force. Josh Brolin does an outstanding job and Katherine Waterston does a fine job as the femme fatale. The movie was hilarious and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Seeing as how I'm a  huge Thomas Pynchon fan, it was thrilling to see this masterful director and these virtuoso actors transform the offbeat novel into a thrilling, enjoyable film."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "If you'd have asked me to rate this the first time I saw it, it would've been around a 3 or a 4. It was very hard to keep up with the convoluted plot. I personally don't know who could've ever kept up with it! But then I gave it another viewing, just going with it (as many sites and reviewers have suggested), and I loved it! The atmosphere is wonderful and it feels like it came straight out of the 70s. I noticed a lot I never noticed before and some of the movie is just plain silly (in a good way; silly dialogue). I definitely recommend this movie, just enjoy it for the aesthetics and laughs rather than trying to remember everything that goes on and every named mentioned (or you won't enjoy it). Then again I haven't read the book either, but I'm intrigued to do so now. Also, I wouldn't compare this in any way to The Big Lebowski.. It's nothing like it. There's really nothing like this movie. It's definitely neat and original."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Genuinely funny, trippy neo-noir sees stoner PI Phoenix trying to unravel a case while being out of it all of the time.

It's probably my favorite Joaquin Phoenix movie - and my favorite Josh Brolin film. Unfortunately (and it's really not a knock on this film), it's not close to my favorite PT Anderson film.  Punch Drunk Love, There Will Be Blood, Boogie Nights - those were massive achievements. This is more light, breezy entertainment."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "A great experience. Many chuckles; one intriguing character after another. Much unresolved, but that is so true to Pynchon. Best movie I've seen in years."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I love films like this for the most part and Inherent Vice is no exception to that. Perpetually in a drug induced haze, Detective Larry \"Doc\" Sportello, portrayed brilliantly by Joaquin Phoenix, stumbles around trying to solve a case he cannot quite wrap his head around. Hell, there may not even be a case. But, what is certain is that he has no idea what is going on and neither does the audience. Impossible to follow and impossible to wrap your head around, Inherent Vice is a film that gives you a bunch of different puzzle pieces from different puzzles and tells you to put them together. Yet, in spite of that, I loved it. Our confusion mirrors that of Doc and really makes the film and enjoyable watch. It also does not hurt that it has a stellar cast on top of Joaquin Phoenix, including Benecio del Toro, Josh Brolin, Reese Witherspoon, Katherine Waterston, Joanna Newsom, Michael K. Williams, and Martin Short. No one other than Phoenix has that much screen time, but what they are given, they knock out of the park. The direction and writing from Paul Thomas Anderson are stellar as always. The film also does a great job capturing the drug-induced era it is set in and is a beautiful snapshot of the less than nice areas of Los Angeles in the 1970's. If you are comfortable not knowing what the hell is going on, but are willing to still sit there and try to piece together this possibly unsolvable \"case\", Inherent Vice is the film for you. Though it may not make much sense, Inherent Vice is just a really enjoyable and really, really well made film that even if the \"plot\" does not do it for you, there should be enough here for you to appreciate."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "Ten minutes in, I think this is a brilliant movie.  An hour later, I am frustrated by the choices the Director has made; an hour later I wonder why this story was told at all; it seems designed to annoy and frustrate the viewer...as much as I tried to appreciate \"The Master\", I now feel that the Director is way too focused on style over substance, and the storytelling of \"Boogie Nights\" is nowhere to be seen.  All the more frustrating because I wanted to love this film."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "If The Big Lebowski had been a two-part episode of The Rockford Files, it would have been Inherent Vice.

Not the best film of the year to be sure, and a great deal of people won't like it. I enjoyed it immensely, Joaquin Phoenix and Josh Brolin are fantastic, and I am always intrigued by PT Anderson's choices as a director, even if I don't agree with them. While I wouldn't count this as PT's best, I enjoyed it just as much as I did \"The Master,\" which was one of my favorite films that year. At year's end, the best films I've seen have been The Grand Budapest Hotel, Boyhood, the sadly under-rated Blue Ruin, Nightcrawler, Inherent Vice, and Whiplash. I am still very excited to see J.C. Chandor's \"A Most Violent Year\" as well. You might not enjoy Inherent Vice much (maybe not at all), but if you have enjoyed PT Anderson's films in the past, it will at least be an interesting experience. Not for everyone, but it's easily one of the most interesting films this year, and certainly one of the better."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "This is the perfect movie for insomniacs. Or people who actually LIKE Thomas Pynchon novels. Only two things will disturb your rest. Josh Brolin, in his relatively limited screen time, manages to inject actual energy into his role. It's worth staying awake to see him. And, of course, Katherine Waterston bares all, and that will surely wake you up. Personally, I was glad when I needed to leave the theater for a while and use the facilities. The folks selling popcorn and soda pop were more engaged than anyone on screen ('ceptin' Brolin, of course)."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "If Hunter S. Thompson and David Lynch got together and wrote/directed a comedy, Inherent Vice would be the likely result.  The movie is bizzaro.  Joaquin Phoenix plays hippie dope-head private investigator Doc Sportello, who is trying to solve the disappearance his ex-girlfriend (Katherine Waterston) and her new lover (Eric Roberts), a wealthy real estate developer.  The dialogue, at times, is difficult to hear/understand.   The plot is even more difficult to follow.  All you can do is inhale the psychedelic haze the permeates the movie, let go of reality and let things unfold.  Unfortunately, there isn\u2019t quite enough substance to the story line to sustain the movie\u2019s almost 2\u00bd hour run time.  Joaquin Phoenix, as, always, gives a terrific performance.  The cast is deep (including Josh Brolin, Reese Witherspoon, Owen Wilson, Beneicio Del Toro, Maya Rudolph and Jena Malone).  Brolin is perfectly cast for his role, which is a send-up of the quintessential 1960\u2019s LA police detective.  Martin Short is particularly funny in a brief stint as the immoral and drug abusing dentist Rudy Blatnoyd.  I found aspects of the movie fascinating, but overall, it came up short.

PTA has some great work under his belt (There Will Be Blood, Punch Drunk Love, and Magnolia personal favs) and this is easily his worst and least entertaining piece to date.  Joaquin mumbles his lines, random characters babble nonsense, a scene ends with an obscene gesture, rinse and repeat.

It symbolizes and homages Tarantino, Drugs and Comedy in a way nobody has ever seen before. Joaquin Pheonix gives us a splendid performance as Doc Sportello and Josh Brolin gives a good performance as well. The chemistry between the two is funny to watch and very well written as well. The cast of A listers also does a great job. The sheer enjoyment of watching a funny, relaxing 60's drug fulled drama is just... Perfect.

Paul Thomas Anderson really knows what Cinema means."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Joaquin Phoenix and Josh Brolin are good fun to watch. Almost sufficiently Pynchon-esque, references to Philip Lorca Decorcia, Tarantino and south-bay jackie Brown. Some Kubrick-like absurdity.

I wonder if PT can make a film relying on caricatures a little less, Magnolia comes close. Perhaps 15 minutes could have cut out with no damage.

That is a huge undertaking for a film and it could have gone in a depressing or simply ranting direction. Instead, this filmmaker elicits both outrage and empathy in the viewer for the conditions surrounding us humans as we flail our way through the inevitable injustices and heroics of life in the 21st century.\rJoaquin Phoenix and Josh Brolin create a chemistry which sums up so much of the opposing forces that surround us, socially, politically and spiritually.\r I highly recommend this film but suggest you allow yourself to go along for the ride, and let the multifaceted emotions, and wonderful humor wash over you as you plough through, an, at times, indiscernible plot.
