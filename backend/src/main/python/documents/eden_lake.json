I think Watkins need more slaps to learn that\rthrowing horrors at our face is not that hard, any moron can do that.\r- Take some victims that we can rely a little, make them suffer from stupids young kids, defend themselves, then be tortured like if nothing never gonna hurt them, no police, just make bleed the tourists.\rIt's voyeurism, it's porn blood, it's inhumanity for the sake of entertainment. No message behind, except maybe that young male kids are brutal and deserve to be killed. Thank you for this nice lesson of life."

      "text": "Eden Lake's underlying message may be a bit Daily Mail, but it remains an extremely effective British horror film. It's tense, scary, and well-performed (particularly by Kelly Reilly and the terrifying Jack O'Connell). Writer/director James Watkins skillfully contrasts the idyllic middle-class lifestyles of Jenny (Reilly) and Steve (Michael Fassbender) with the nightmarish wilderness in which they find themselves stranded and hunted by a gang of truly monstrous teenagers. The whole film has a feeling of steadily building dread, which doesn't abate even when we reach the film's excellently terrifying finale. Even the idea of demonic teenagers as a credible threat in a horror film works, and all the better since unrest we witnessed in the UK last year. Perhaps the film's beginning is a little too twee and drawn out, and you do find yourself feeling as though you're living inside a right-wing tabloid once the film really gets going. However, Eden Lake is just a horror film using British paranoia about unruly teeenagers to create something scary - it's not really endorsing the ridiculous sweeping statements about society that tabloids are often guilty of making. As a horror film, it succeeds - it's scary, it's tense, it's gruesome, and it's got a classic horror movie structure - city dwellers go to the country and have to fight for survival when they encounter some nasty locals - it's pure Texas Chainsaw Massacre! As a social commentary, you can't take it too seriously, but then again, I doubt that's what James Watkins ever intended his film to be. You'll certainly think twice before leaving the safety of your house and going camping in the wilderness again!"

      "text": "The angle with the kids is interesting, as they have great capacity for evil, especially in groups, under the wrong influences. The female lead is a teacher, and should know how to handle kids. This is a good angle that could have rendered an original horror-flick. Unfortunately, it gets cluttered with the typical mix found in too many horror-movies: The victims' irrational, illogical behavior, and utter lack of self-preservation instincts, as they keep messing up, doing the wrong things... and have some bad luck on top of that. This almost fully drows the message in this movie: How the last girl standing should have made different choices. This film is no more than mediocre. A good horror movie should have more going for it than just being painful to watch (which it was, and which may explain its high rating)."

I'm afraid if you're labouring under the delusion that kids don't do stuff like this, you're sorely mistaken.

A really tough and brutal watch but if you can stomach it you will be rewarded with a tense and compelling film. I really liked the fact that there was no creepy monsters but that the couple are running from a bunch of kids. I think the reflection on society is quite valid, while it may pander to media scare mongering that doesn't stop it from being any more relevant."

      "text": "I gace this film a 5 and not a zero because of the fine work of the actors, editors, cameramen and other technicians.In fact, even the directing is good for its purpose.  This kind of film puts me on the fence because the acting, directing, and editing are all very good in a lot of these kinds of films.  You believe its happening while you watch and you suspect this kind of thing could possibly happen... at least while the film's tension is making you grit your teeth.  On the other hand, the whole point of the film and what it suggests is what ruins it. This is torture porn or what I call \"The cruelty genre\" where humans have absolutely no regard for another human and behave in ways that are very unrealistic in the scope of real life situations.  The films character's become so focused on their cruel needs that nothing in the real world intercedes like hunger, boredom, fatigue, distractions, changes in loyalty the fact that someone might sneeze.  once the cruel characters start their mission they become demons that never faulter in their quest to inflict harm on the protagonists and this is just stupid.  We have seen films make a fine point with extreme violence and the social monsters we create in neglected environments (clockwork orange).  How many more of these films do we need to see where the only point is pure manipulation of the audience.  The only point is tension itself.  There is an old commercial made in the states for Dupont by the agency Young & Rubicam  where a voice over tells you how a material made by Dupont is incredibly temperature neutral.  They show a metal box made of this material.  they show a bunson burner boiling water.  they put a baby chick in the box and place the box holding the live chick in the boiling water and the voice over speaks very languidly about the product.  the tension is enormous as you feel you are watching this poor little chick die.  then they take the box out and the chick is perfectly fine.  They sold me. amazing.  what is this film selling me? fear and hatred toward the neglected class?  please.  How many more filmmakers are going to try and say the same thing using human cruelty as their medium.  if you need to see this message expressed watch \"Funny Games\"  it has a point and it makes you squirm. IT is probably the last film that should ever be made about callous and mindless cruelty."

      "text": "This is of a theme with the 00's European horror films. A fear of youths. Hoodie horror I've heard it called. Its roots are steeped in \"The Last House on the Left\" and \"I Spit on Your Grave\". Men get it here too. Growing up and becoming square is the ultimate evil.This movie and its ilk are clearly made by men who have grown up and haven't quite come to grips with how old they are yet. They feel young inside but are afraid of the actual young because they don't recognize them or their interests - they have nothing in common anymore. It's all the same from generation to generation but this generation just so happens to be the first truly weened on pop culture - specifically movies and TV telling them how important and special their childhoods were (see the 80's nostalgia parade that just won't end).There's a lot of good tension here but it's all in service of pure torture (also an 00's theme). Eden Lake is hurtful and mean and unrelenting in its nihilism. This is both good and bad. If it had more to say it might be good, but it's really a genre exercise about a final woman outsmarting these terrible kids (their inexplicable brutality just suddenly happens with little build-up or explanation - it lacks the surreal unknown of \"Them (Ils)\"). It all works but to what end? At a certain point you just start rolling your eyes when the main character does something like bury herself in a pile of poopy sludge."

      "text": "This film is another one of those films where an unsuspecting couple, due to a trivial situation, becomes a victim of a mortal, scary and dangerous situation. We have already seen a lot of these, like the films \"You're Next\" or \"The Last House on the Left\", also based on the same premises, but that does not takes away, I think, the merit due to this film that, despite from failures, it manages to give us what it promises: entertainment under tension.The script shows how a couple sees their plans for a romantic weekend, on the shores of a beautiful secluded lake, spoiled by a group of threatening and dangerous teenagers led by a \"wannabe\" psychopath. The story starts well and develops in a crescendo of violence and brutality, and the way the characters present themselves allows us to establish a good empathy with the couple and want to see the punishment of that devilish brats. James Watkins, who signs the direction and the script, was able to do an excellent job and knew how to guide and develop his film in the best way. Its explicitly violent so its inadvisable for children, and even teenagers and young adults should view it with the some precautions. But that does not mean that it is not a good film... in fact, its one of the best films of its kind that I have seen.The excellent performance of the cast was decisive for the quality of the final product. On the one hand we have Kelly Reilly, absolutely convincing in her role and managing not to be histrionic and appear genuine. On the other hand, a huge Michael Fassbender, in one of the first cinema works of his career, opening the doors to higher flights. He was truly authentic and genuine. But the villains were not far behind! Jack O'Connell was scary in the role of leader Brett and Finn Atkins was also excellent and hateful. Unfortunately, the ending manages to disappoint us for not giving us what we want.Technically, it seemed like a regular film, we can even say that it was well done if we take into account the limited budget and the fact that it is an independent film. Cinematography offers us good scenery and an excellent choice of landscapes, in addition to the intelligent use of film drones for aerial view scenes. The costumes and effects also seemed convincing to me, especially that filthy trash can where that character has to hide, which even made me vomit."

      "text": "If you can suspend your disbelief - that this film's cast of villains is exaggerated and borderline comical - then this film will leave you shaken to the core with its succulent doses of tensity.The film follows Michael Fassbender and Kelly Reilly acting it out as a couple looking to spend time together in a secluded lake. They arrive there, seeking to relax, and for Fassbender's character, it is the perfect time for him to push their relationship further with a special plan. As with other horror films of this nature, the couple's romantic trip derails quickly into violence as their collision with a group of teenagers (led by Brett, played by Jack O'Connell) fuels a fight for survival.Eden Lake operates on the same fundamental level as its contemporaries, fulfilling its role as dirty violence. The film is tense, gory, and conclusively upsetting, but that's what makes it work so well. Forget about moral complications and deeper thematic constructs. Maybe there's something interesting here with the way it tackles the moral decay of the working class and its unchecked youth. It's clear, however, that the film is less concerned with its ideas and is more geared towards serving a fine slasher horror. And that's where its strength lies.It's fun to have a film that can be both delicious in its bloody imagery and utterly dreadful in its bleak story. Kelly Reilly gives out a performance that allows much of the film's straightforward plot to remain engaging, as her role as the girlfriend leaves a memorable portrayal of one's thirst for survival. It's Reilly's performance that evokes an appeal that compliments O'Connell's unrelenting brutality. At the end of the day, the film is strictly linear in regards to following a conventional formula. But sometimes, it's all you need for this type of work. Besides, it is tightly executed and provides an explosive ending.If anything, Eden Lake packs a delicious sucker punch to the stomachs of its audience. And that - is good enough."
