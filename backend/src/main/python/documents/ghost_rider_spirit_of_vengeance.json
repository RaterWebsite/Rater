Ghost Rider has died to me thanks the recent films. The comics will never be the same to me again. And was it good for a movie for non-fans? Nope. It was pure crap. Only thing keeping me in the theater was half disbelief, a quarter because I had anticipated it for a long time (idiotically), and a quarter because of pride, afraid to show my wife my insecurities with a bad choice I made in film selection for a date... :P"

It is indeed a pity, Ghost Rider is an amazing comic character and could have spawned a great superhero movie and a box-office hit. Let's just hope for a decent reboot in the future."

The trailers made it look like an awesome, crazy, and over the top action movie with some hilarious moments, however the movie failed to deliver that. It seems to me like the people behind this movie couldn't decide what they wanted to do with this movie. It couldn't decide whether to be some super serious movie, or the zany over the top, humorous movie the trailers showed. When it's trying to be serious it ends up being super boring, and when it's trying to be over the top it's like the director didn't know how to make it happen so it falls flat, and because of this the action scenes are really boring. It's got some funny moments, some intentional most not, but that's mostly do Nicolas Cage's performance, although I think most of my laughs were at his poor performance rather than genuine humor in the script. Actually just about every performance in this was poor. There are so many things wrong with this movie that I couldn't fit them all into this review, but by far the worst flaw this movie has it that at times you can see hints of a great movie in there. You'll only see them for a second, but their there and that's what makes it so sad. Even sadder is that most of the movies hints of greatness are also in the trailer."

While most of the action with the rider were pretty good, this film had a lot of \"WTF was the director smoking when he made this?\"  Several places there was either horrible overacting or underacting.  No of the characters are really likable, none of them have any depth and none of them are particularly memorable.  The plot was decent enough but it was horribly told.  This is not the same Johnny Blaze or Ghost Rider of the first film.  Johnny Blaze is extremely shallow and Ghost Rider is overpowered.  Enjoy the couple of laughs and the few truly good sequences with the rider in them and forget the rest."

I didnt read Ghost Rider too often, but I knew Blaze's origins and I knew they at least tried to get it as close as possible at the front of the first film. Of course, the first film had its issues, but they are small compared to the garbage that this brings to the table. This film is called Ghost Rider... but he is only in for about Fifteen minutes. Unlike the first film, the action scenes are slow, and have no tension to them once you see the Rider just standing there with a bad guy who he's grabbed by the collar for over a minute and a half while said bad guy's mates are standing there doing nothing but looking dumb. Another mistake I noticed was that not only did they make Ghost Rider get hurt by explosives, but they make him immune to them less than twenty minutes later in the best action scene in the film which is far too short to be satisfying. The pace of this film by the way is simply unbearable. The story is garbage, and the plot takes too long to go somewhere. We are stuck in a church for what feels like an eternity explaining origins of the Ghost Rider and how to rid one of the curse (which I wont spoil, so true fans can simply rent the film). The effects are a mixed bag. Some of the time they look cool, but at other times they just dont look right at all. And there are some things I dont like that they were unable to do due to the STUPID budget constraints put on the film (you cant make this with fifty mil, its that simple). Things like Blazes bike not transforming when he becomes the rider anymore, or how when he takes over other mechanical objects like a truck, the only thing that changes is that they light on fire. Whatever, in the end the movie just feels really unfinished, and I know the minds behind Crank 1 and 2 are capable of much better things. The best part for me was in the middle of the film when Ghost Rider just lays destruction upon everything he sees with a giant piece of construction equippment. I at least got that out of it."

So I went into this film with an open mind. Firstly, this is nothing like the first film. Everything is different, with the exception being Mr. Cage. It is very much a B-movie. Something you can imagine with lots of action, almost zero plot, and character development that seems to have gone up in smoke. It bears very little resemblence to the comic. It's a mash-up of Crank with a really bad B-action movie (think a recent Van Damm movie) and that it the best way to describe it. It's nothing more than a Meh film, that left me bored at the first half an hour and clock watching till the end. If it comes on telly, maybe check it out if nothing else is on. But I wouldn't go out of my way to view it. Simply Meh."

From now on, whenever you hear the words GHOST RIDER, the first thing that comes to your mind it will be a veryy baddd movie! They definitely do not have enough good basic material to build a reasonable movie in the first place, thiz is for the second time! The first GHOST RIDER in 2007 was one of the ugliest superhero movies ever made. Anyway, I have my respect for the Directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor. Generally, I like their works especially the stylish camera angle and color structure. A little bit rough, energetic and sometimes comical, with fast moving scenes exactly like they had shown in CRANK (2006) and GAMER (2009). But that is certainly not enough. Thiz time, Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage), the alter-ego of Ghost Rider has to protect a child from the devil in human form upon the demand of a monk named Moreau (Idris Elba). The storyline is obviously weak in all aspects. They tell a simple story in long and boring 90+ minutes. Furthermore, the setting is told in Europe. Hello... where is the Europe? I do not see Europe! All I see is desert and rocky mountains in the middle of nowhere. After all, the Ghost Rider character is originally dark and mysterious. That atmosphere is clearly not shown here. They are using too much sick humor and too much clear blue sky, if you know what I mean. It crossed my mind, it could be totally different if they hire the Director who knows how to make a convincing shade of dark gothic like Tim Burton or Guillermo del Toro. The next thing is Nicolas Cage. I do not know what really happened to Cage, he is obviously trying to look cool with his cheesy one-liner dialogue. Moreover, in some scenes when Blaze struggled to hold back the devil inside him to come out, he creates a very strange and amusing expression. The rest of the Casts delivering B-Class performance such as: Idris Elba, Violante Placido, Johnny Whitworth, Christopher Lambert, even the child Fergus Riordan. the Devil once said to Johnny Blaze, You were the worst fricking deal I ever made. well, I have my complaint too, I just want my money back!\r Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com"

      "text": "First, the good things.  GRSOV is better than its predecessor.  This wasn't a sequel, it was a reboot.  And with David Goyer writing, it was expected to be better.  Graphically, GR looked much better.  He was much more of a character in this film.  Nic Cage's Johnny Blaze was much better. I loved that they skimmed over the origin.  It was very well done.  The action sequences were also top notch.  However, the bad is a mix of what is bad about film-making in general and the unmet expectations of comic book lovers for Marvel Knight characters in general.  Ghost Rider is a pseudo interesting character to begin with.  In theory, he should make a bad-ass film protagonist.  In reality, he's great in action and graphically, but even Goyer's writing skills can't make him that interesting. Like the abysmal attempts at getting a good Punisher on film, the reality is, the Marvel Knights characters will never make interesting films as long as the focus is on the violent part of their characters rather than what makes them dark in the first place.  So, in the long line of poor attempts, GRSOV ranks higher than Punisher: War Zone, Dolph Lundgren's Punisher and the original GR, but that's about it. I truly hope there isn't a third."

      "text": "I honestly don't even know where to begin. After the brief snippet of footage that was screened at Comic Con 2011, I had a tremendous amount of faith in GHOST RIDER: SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE. I'm a huge fan of the work that Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor did with the CRANK films, and I thought their unorthodox style would benefit the GHOST RIDER franchise and result in a sequel that far surpassed its predecessor. Yeah, not so much. This film is a colossal disaster from start to finish, featuring a script that seems unfinished, characters that are barely established, and one of the absolute worst performances in Nicolas Cage's career. After a stylish animation sequence that establishes the character's origin, we find Johnny Blaze living in the Balkans for reasons that are never quite explained (this will become a recurring theme for nearly every major plot point in the film). An alcoholic priest named Moreau (Idris Elba with an inconsistent French accent) shows up on his doorstep and offers to lift the Ghost Rider curse in exchange for Blaze rescuing a young boy named Danny (Fergus Riordan) from the same demonic entity that purchased Blaze's soul, an entity that is now called Roarke rather than Mephistopheles and is now played by Ciarin Hinds rather than Peter Fonda. Blaze jumps on his bike and takes off, showing up just as our incredibly boring and non-threatening bad guy Carrigan (Johnny Whitworth) catches up with Danny and his Gypsy mother (Violante Placido). The Ghost Rider emerges and begins to lay waste to Carrigan's henchmen, turning them into piles of ash and terrifying the bejesus out of everyone - except Carrigan, who takes him out with a grenade launcher and disappears with the kid. The rest of the film is essentially one drawn-out chase sequence, punctuated by conveniently placed dialogue scenes where our characters try (and fail) to explain exactly what the hell is going on, amounting to nothing more than speed bumps on the road to Blaze's next transformation into his flaming skeletal alter-ego. To level the playing field, Roarke grants Carrigan some demonic powers of his own, leaving him with pale skin, a bad hair-metal wig, and the EXACT SAME ABILITIES as the first film's (far more interesting) villain, resulting in confrontations that feel boring, recycle, and unimaginative - because they are. Cage's manic, frenzied portrayal of Blaze feels nothing like the character he created in the first film, resulting in plenty of absurd, laughable moments as he shifts the insanity into overdrive, particularly in an interrogation scene where the Ghost Rider is \"scraping at the DOOOOOOOR\"and Blaze is trying desperately to hold him back. This performance is certainly the highlight of the film - unfortunately, it's for all the wrong reasons. While the new design of the Ghost Rider looks fantastic, featuring a charred skull and a leather jacket that bubbles and melts from the heat, the character feels like something from a cartoon, head tilted quizzically to one side as he contemplates his victims or giggling to himself as he turns a piece of construction equipment into a flaming instrument of death. Oh, and he pisses fire, of course. I'll give Neveldine and Taylor all the credit in the world for the adventurous and innovative method of filmmaking they developed on the CRANK films, but this style doesn't work here. GHOST RIDER: SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE is poorly written, poorly edited, and poorly acted, and accomplishes nothing except to showcase that Neveldine and Taylor obviously have no idea what makes the character work. Make no mistake, this is the BATMAN AND ROBIN of the GHOST RIDER franchise, and everyone involved in this mess should be ashamed of themselves. www.nerdrep.com"

Instead we have the ghost rider, well, opening his mouth and moaning a lot... yeah seriously that's his thing.

Certainly quality never entered into the picture.  Quantity may have... as there's plenty of mess to go around.

It creates inconsistencies in the minds of the viewer that wouldn't be there if the actor had been replaced.There were certainly some serious inconsistencies in Ghost Riders powers. He is knocked out by a grenade launcher, but when he is shot by a stinger missile, which is obviously much more powerful, he shrugs it off completely.II think the actual appearance of Ghost Rider was pretty good, but in several fight sequences, he just kind of meanders around. I expected the Spirit of Vengeance to be brutal and he kind of played cat and mouse instead.There are also far too many unneeded, flat plot devices, such as Cage losing the spirit, only to regain it 10 minutes later, the evil or misguided tattooed priests, and the angel randomly regaining sanity(A plot point that could have been really good if it hadn't been essentially a throwaway line in the film).The quick synopsis is that this movie tried to fit too many plot points into the movie, and ended up developing none of them very well. I think this movie is far worse than the original Ghost Rider, and roughly equal with Punisher War Zone in the quality of a movie."

The only good scene was where we got a glimpse of the crazy Nic Cage that I love in an interrogation scene. Skip this drivel and go watch Chronicle."

From the lackluster action sequences where all Ghost Rider has to do to defeat his foes is swing his chains to Nicholas Cage's simply loony acting this movie truly offers nothing to us. I am a huge superhero movie fan and slightly enjoyed Ghost Rider 1. DONT EXPECT THEM TO MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT THE PREVIOUS MOVIE. Except for the fact it's Nicholas Cage, there is no connection. THis movie's story is a consistent set of plotholes so gaping and awkward that the extreme nerd on you is going to cry blood.  Nothing after the credits. The visuals in this movie would be GREAT for a grad student's portfolio reel but the times they selected to use the over-the-top imagery are ill-fitting. Maybe it's because ghost-rider himself is a crappy hero to have a movie about but if this movie was a kitten I would not pet it."

      "text": "Terrible, DO NOT WATCH.This was the worse movie I have seen in a while. I hated The Green Lantern but this somehow was actually worse. The director of this movie needs to be put down. It was badly put together no coherence between scenes and made the spirit of vengeance out to be a guy with a flaming skull who looks at you weird. They should maybe look through the bad guy list for this series and actually use a good one, if it wasn't those elemental demons from the first one, we get another useless villain. The storyline was so telegraphed you could easily guess what was about to happen.Nicholas Cage had some of the worse acting in his entire career. The fight scenes were short and sh@t, Ghost Rider had two mover stare into a persons face almost using penance stare, or swing his chain and kill the bad guys in one hit..If you are going to make ghost rider movies like this, then don't, stop and think. Your practically ruining an entire series.This movie deserves a zero and I want my time back. P.S. anyone giving this movie a score of 4 or more is insane."

Parce que l\u00c3\u00a0, descendre bien plus bas \u00c3\u00a9tait impensable, surtout avec un sc\u00c3\u00a9nariste potable et des cin\u00c3\u00a9astes d\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00a9s. Malheureusement, le probl\u00c3\u00a8me provient plus de la r\u00c3\u00a9alisation qu'autre chose (bon, il y a quand m\u00c3\u00aame un sc\u00c3\u00a9nario lamentable et des acteurs nullissimes). Et pour cause, les frangins responsables d'Hypertension nous livre un trip insuivable! Avec une mise en sc\u00c3\u00a8ne (plans, montage...) abaissant le film au niveau d'un t\u00c3\u00a9l\u00c3\u00a9film de s\u00c3\u00a9rie Z, le Ghost Rider n'est pas pr\u00c3\u00aat d'entrer dans le coeur des fans de Marvel. Franchement, avec un travail soign\u00c3\u00a9, cette suite aurait pu \u00c3\u00aatre l'\u00c3\u00a9gal d'un Blade ou m\u00c3\u00aame monter au niveau d'un Hellboy. A croire que les r\u00c3\u00a9alisateurs se sont enflamm\u00c3\u00a9s \u00c3\u00a0 vouloir \u00c3\u00a0 tout prix travailler avec Cage sans pour autant amuser le spectateur... Croyez-moi, en moins de 1h40, le premier film est devenu un chef-d'oeuvre!"

The characters are very bland and never thought out. (I'm looking at you Nicholas Cage!) Also, the story is VERY boring and i often zoned out and just realized they were at a different place. What's Next? Oh, they returned back to the place. Oh, some random guy got rotting powers. However, the special effects were very nice, from Ghost Rider spitting bullets or the Zombie guy rotting away at people's flesh.Alltogether, throughout this movie i just wanted it to end... now"

Nicolas Cage's performance has never been worse. This movie was 50x as bad as the first which I believe was an ok film, but I honestly think the purpose of this movie was to make a quick buck."
