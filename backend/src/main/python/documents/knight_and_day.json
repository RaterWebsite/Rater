Tom cruise and Cameron Diaz may be a sexy couple or just aging veterans having their last screentime. It's a movie where I can't really judge with optimism; it's one of those movies where you decide it."

I'm a guy so Diaz takes my breath away. Tom is trying to explain but keeps getting interrupted. After time she begins to get it and the progression is great fun and well timed. As others have pointed out the end feels rushed but after soaking up all that sunshine you feel it should go on much longer. If you enjoy Bond movie's or just about any bang up movie this is great. Ignore the comments about poor execution or poor CGI. The film is at it's best with bullets flying and Diaz."

      "text": "Did he train you? Did he rehearse you? Did he tell you what to do and what to say? These questions, of course, are part of the famous speech that Jimmy Stewart delivers to Kim Novak in Alfred Hitchcock's \"Vertigo\", just before Scottie Ferguson loses Judy for a second time, this time for real, when Madeleine's ghost plunges from the mission tower to her death, the end result of Stewart's character's inability to deal with the intrigue between his obsession and Gavin Elster(Tom Helmore). She fell from a high place, and she fell hard, just like Tom Cruise, a man who knows a thing or two about vertigo. Cruise, fresh off his bravura comic performance in Ben Stiller's \"Tropic Thunder\", where the former mega-star didn't quite look like himself as a Hollywood producer, looks exactly like the actor we remember from the last century who danced in his underwear, as \"Day and Knight\" outfits the \"Risky Business\" star with the right hair, the right clothes. and most importantly, the right elan to ingratiate our Tom with the moviegoing public who finally grew tired of his public persona. From the first moment we see Cruise surveying the airport for a mule, it's as if he emerged from a puff of green smoke; it's as if he never jumped on Oprah's couch; it's as if he never lamblasted the mental health profession. But alas, moviegoers have long memories. Scottie's questions are our questions, as we receive each new Cruise performance; pointed questions in reference to his guru, the science fiction writer who founded The Church of Scientology. Playing a rogue FBI agent named Roy Miller, Cruise, who alienated so many people(starting with Brooke Shields) because of his disdain for anti-depressants, in \"Knight and Day\", on a subtextual level, loses the ideological war with the psychiatric profession, as its Roy's job to keep the Zephyr(a self-perpetuating battery) stable, a job that he's unable to perform. The Zephyr becomes unstable; it blows up. Roy has a manic quality about him. Most tellingly, Cruise comes close to performing a Nazi salute when he tells June(Cameron Diaz) about her odds for survival, both with or without his protection. It reminds the moviegoer that Scientologists believe psychiatry to be a \"Nazi science\". So how is \"Day and Knight\" most like \"Vertigo? It's the scene where June wakes up in a red bikini on Roy's secret island; he saw her naked, just like Scottie, who changed Madeleine's clothes after she had jumped in the San Francisco Bay. But then \"Day and Knight\" goes one step further, as June returns the favor, clothing Roy in shorts during his blackout. He's **** like a Hitchcock blonde, just like Kim Novak. June sees Roy, sees Cruise, at his most naked. Perhaps she cured Roy/Tom of his vertigo."

      "text": "As an acting duo, Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise are effortlessly fantastic, they make an elegant eloping couple but it is the storyline that is what lets this film down. The action is non-stop, with a hint of sexual tension here and there, but the action is just your standard bullet-in-chest violence, nothing will really make you think \"cor, I bet that hurt\". The comedy is tongue in cheek, all the best bits were in the trailers and Cruise's patronising tone just really didn't do it for me. This almost out-law couple film never really gives away why it is called 'Knight and Day' either, despite the use of a small knight figure to hold Miller's secret.So, I ask myself, are Diaz and Cruise just getting too old for this? Cruise's flash of flesh in the beach scenes could not hide the wrinkles that are starting to appear around Diaz's eyes. When it comes down to what the audience want, it's definitely not older generation actors trying to jump around when they clearly aren't made for the action any more. Not saying they've done their time, but there were plenty of younger actors and actresses that could have made this a sexier and must more aesthetically pleasing film. A bit of a downer on the plot was Diaz being constantly drugged because she couldn't 'cope' in the midst of the action. Alas, it felt like half the action was missing because she was passing out! The audience never saw Miller getting out of a violent situation completely, and just goes to show that Diaz never stopped being the damsel in distress since Shrek.At times the entire film felt a bit of a joke, almost like a mockery of the whole action genre itself, the way Cruise talked sarcastically in spy terms and the unsuitable soundtrack that meant every gunshot and explosion could be predicted. For a 12A, I expected nothing less, but for Cruise's comeback I expected more. I think James Mangold could have made this film a lot darker, particularly concerning Miller's family who we barely see any of. The plot overall is so simple you won't even need to pay attention half the time. There was far too much CGI and green screen noticeable, it was disappointing because a lot of the stunts on the motorbikes were impressive.If it was this or A-Team, I would have chosen A-Team. Knight and Day is too easy on the eyes and won't get you thinking like Inception, or even Toy Story 3! Just don't bother unless you really have to."

Tom Cruise plays the spy (which makes the film interesting already), and Diaz along his side for the ride, in which she seems like she doesn't care what her fellow does except shooting bad guys and \"re-enatcing grand theft auto on the I-94\" makes the film a complete trainwreck but at the same time, addictive. Director James Mangold makes the film into an ongoing compilation of barely comical scenes with a nice heaping of action to compensate. Bad scenes for 2 hours and 10 minutes, and a dose of Diaz and Tom Cruise makes the film a \"No\". Go see something else."

      "text": "Yes, Tom Cruise is a knight in shining armor. Yes, Cameron Diaz is still looking fresh in daylight. If you are looking a movie to have fun with, thiz movie is definitely the one. It is a typical Hollywood popcorn movie. The storyline is predictable, the sequence is easy-watching, the comedy is corny, the action is absurd and they rely much on charisma of two main Casts, who in thiz case are Cruise and Diaz. Thiz is their second rendevouz. In VANILLA SKY (2001), the atmosphere was gloomy and serious, so people kept thinking how about to put them in another situation. We knew Cruise was an extreme adrenaline junkie in a real life with his motorcycle collection and extreme sports fan. Thiz movie is absolutely the perfect vessel for him to do what he always desires to do, for me thiz will be his trilogy extension of MISSION IMPOSSIBLE (1996-2006). Diaz is charming as always and could merge into any kind of character. The most important thing, she looks like to have fun with her character, for me thiz will be her dwilogy extension of CHARLIE ANGELS (2000-2003). I have to say, even without any addition, The Star-Power of these two main Casts were very powerful. The Director is James Mangold, a talented drama Director (GIRL, INTERRUPTED (1999), IDENTITY (2003), WALK THE LINE (2005), etc.), who tries his luck in action movie like thiz. In the other hand, some people say, movie is for fun. In that case, thiz movie was extremely effective and entertaining. The movie will make you forget how things happen, if you are one of the viewers that emphasizes fun factor as your needs. Well, just buy a ticket, buckle up, and enjoy the ride. At least, thiz one will be one-ride roller coaster fun and that is it!\r Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com"

Never very good, great or very great, but they serve their purpose and I suppose that's precisely what Knight and Day has achieved. Yet you hope for so much more. you hope the comedy will be good and that the action is well staged, and for the most part the film is fun, without being too funny or too thrilling. What I really hope for, though, is that during the film I'm not compelled to look at the person next to me and say, \"this is a bit too stupid isn't it?\". Thankfully, I rarely say this because, like any guilty pleasure, I watch these sorts of films by my self. At least I always know what I'm going to get."

      "text": "In this day and age  in this era  of films  spy movies  are literally a dime a dozen  they are one of the action genres   most common uses for  an action/ adventure  picture  and have spawned many franchises, T.V. series, video games. You name it the spy genre has left there mark somewhere to make sure that you never forget them   the spy game has had a very successful run in the films. Although never quite commanding the respect they deserve from moviegoers who are now a days more interested in seeing dull overdrawn teen romances than good spy thrillers with smart ideas and compelling stories but that is just the way things go theses days. James Mangold's  romantic  action/comedy  \"Knight & Day\" is the perfect example of a spy movie that has all the right ideas the right set ups  and a story good enough to make me want to actually sit through  the whole thing without checking my watch every ten minutes or so  asking myself when it will be over. \"Knight and Day\" is the first great film of the summer.   James Mangold's \"Knight and Day\" is one of those films that flew under my radar until almost two months before its initial release, which for a film with such a high-class director and stars I expected to hear more about this film. Instead I only heard that Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz were working together again after almost 9 years. There last collaboration being Cameron Crowe's bizarre hit \"Vanilla Sky\"(2001)   truthfully that is the main reason went to see this movie. If there were anyone else in the lead roles, I would not have bothered with and gone to see something else instead now I am glad I did not decided to skip this one after all. \"Knight and Day\" is a pure  formula film right down to its story  and plot  even most  of its dialogue  is formula  the most formulaic parts are concerning Cameron Diaz when she is being briefed about Roy Miller(Tom Cruise)  and how he is dangerous and crazy and a traitor, moviegoers have all heard  it before. The  only thing that saves this film from being nothing more than just a run of the mill rehash of other better spy movies   is the breezy pace, snappy dialogue  and a pair of winning performances from Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise  help bring this film out of its familiar territory saving it from a dark and dreary failure.   James Mangold is know for making high quality films  most notably being \"Walk the Line\"(2005), \"Cop Land\"(1997),\" Identity\"(2003), \"3:10  to Yuma\"(2007). \"Knight and Day\" may not be one of Mangold best it certainly is better than his other  comedy type film \"Kate and Leopold\"(2001) which wasn't bad but than again it was not quite that good either it is somewhere in between  \"Knight  and Day\" is far above \"Kate and Leopold\" but it is less imaginative than that film. What I found most impressive about this film and I think moviegoers will as well is the skill and design of this film it uses the clich\u00c3\u00a9s of its simple formula and story to turn what would have been a routine action/adventure/ spy thriller. Into an exceedingly enjoyable film far more enjoyable than could be imagined too enjoyable for its own, good \"Knight and Day\" works.What I wanted form this film  I did not get completely  I wanted to get Cruise and Diaz laughing it up and cracking jokes like it is going out of  style but instead I got rudimentary action, clich\u00c3\u00a9 plot twist. After hearing all this you start asking yourself this question: is this film wroth seeing? Most definitely, I wish there would have been more to it than just action and a pair of good-looking leads falling for each other, running around trying to find a very valuable object it just all seemed too... Familiar and that is okay I like familiar and while \"Knight and Day\u00e2"

They both annoy and charm in equal degree, mainly because I am annoyed I am so charmed by these marginally talented, overpaid actors.
