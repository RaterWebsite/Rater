A college coed wakes up on her birthday only to be murdered by a baby-faced stalker. Each time she dies, she wakes up back in the same dorm room and the only way to stop the cycle is to identify the killer. It's adequately made, but the suspense sequences aren't especially original or even mildly frightening. The satirical self-aware comic insights (a la Scream) never materialize. It's slightly fun to watch her solve the puzzle, but there's little about this film that makes it special."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "In Happy Death Day, a college student relives the day of her murder with both its unexceptional details and terrifying end until she discovers her killer's identity. So, basically, Groundhog Day meets generic teen thriller, heavy on the generic teen thriller.Tree Gelbman* (Jessica Rothe), our lead heroine, is classic movie sorority girl. All she cares about is how she looks and how guys think she looks. The film follows Tree on her birthday and quickly establishes that she\u2019s inconsiderate to everyone in her life that doesn\u2019t fall into those categories. This includes her roommate, other students on campus, and even her own father. Tree\u2019s birthday ends with her own murder at the hands of a masked killer. She then wakes up to find that she has started the day over and must continuing dying until unmasking and stopping her killer. Along the way she may just learn to\u2026 you guessed it\u2026 become a better person.*Yes, her name is Tree. No, it\u2019s not explained.As Tree tries to solve her own murder, she is helped by a fellow student named Carter. It\u2019s Carter\u2019s bed that Tree wakes up in every morning, but they had only just met the night before. Carter is the awkward, nice guy that Tree would never usually go for. Can you see where this is headed? The usual popular girl/nerdy guy trope gets complicated here due to the fact that the defining feature of Carter that clearly and visibly wins Tree over is that he did not take advantage of her when she was drunk. This is her baseline for a nice guy. The revelation that Carter didn\u2019t sleep with Tree is played for swoons. It comes off as problematic.Where Happy Death Day tries to put itself above other generic slashers before it is its sense of fun. When head sorority girl Danielle asks a sister, \u201cWhat even is breakfast, Becky?\u201d I was relieved to realize this wasn\u2019t a film taking itself too seriously. When Danielle later explains to Tree that deja vu actually just means someone is thinking about you while masterbating, I realized I would much rather watch a movie about Danielle. Hell, I\u2019d watch that every week on tv. Awful sorority girls saying awful things while people are being viciously slaughtered all around them? Sounds like a show Ryan Murphy would make. They could even call it \u201cScream Queens\u201d. I\u2019m sure it would be a huge success.Ultimately, Happy Death Day is a movie that works, if only in the slightest, in spite of its many flaws. It\u2019s got a fairly generic plot told in a fairly safe way. The many deaths of Tree aren\u2019t especially creative. She is stabbed under a bridge, she is stabbed in her room, she is stabbed in some guy\u2019s room. It\u2019s the comedic bits, as hit-or-miss as they are, that hold this film together. Is it a good movie? No. Is it an entertaining movie? Sometimes."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Groundhog Day as a slasher flick is such a ripe premise that I'm surprised it took this long to make a film of it. We get to watch the main character get butchered a whole bunch of times in a bunch of different ways by a masked psycho all while trying to solve the mystery of whom is doing it. It's perfect really. The film definitely has its fun with this too, and has a game performance from the lead actress Jessica Rothe.Unfortunately it's a bit of a neutered affair, what with the PG-13 rating and fairly rote storytelling mechanics. Death scenes are less Final Destination levels of fun - where the surprise is how she will die while trying to avoid death - and more stalk and slash and quick cut away from any good gore. The plot has a twist, and it's not bad, but there were a lot of areas where the film could have become even twistier. It also could have laid off the moralizing about becoming a better woman stuff a bit - this is slasher Groundhog Day, not actually the real thing. We already have that."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "The \"Groundhog Day\"/\"Edge Of Tomorrow\" formula gets put to the test once again in \"Happy Death Day,\" a slasher comedy that plays out pretty much exactly as you'd expect (thanks in no small part to that formula mentioned above). And with a predictable-as-all-hell third act twist capstoning this one, you'd think I wouldn't enjoy it. And yet, I - for the most part - did. Sure, the charming lead performance helps, but I think the x-factor here is just the simple fact that this is yet another competently made horror movie that made its way past my eyes without making me want to void one of my orifices.

The acting is nothing special, except for the performance of  Jessica Rothe. She is fantastic in this movie. She's a very charismatic lead, and she carries the film on her shoulders. Her portrayal of Tree Gelbman easily elevates the film to a 7 for me. Other than that, there's not a whole lot here. I did appreciate how self aware the movie was, and it made the self awareness work in the humor department. It's not really scary at all, but it is an interesting concept."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Happy death day is something special. Thriller, but there's more. Comic movie? yes, just a little bit.

It ended up being a competent horror/comedy/mystery movie.  I would say that the movie had quite a bit of charm and character development for a movie I expected nothing out of.  It even goes out of its way to reference Groundhog Day, poking fun at itself.  It's not a masterpiece, but I really enjoyed it."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "\"Scary Movie\", \"Scream\" and Groundhog Day adopt a wicked baby maskOn this base idea is set up Blumhouse Productions' latest big hit, Jason Blum's production company has been crowned as the only studio to make a huge profit at the box office with low-budget medium-high quality films. Being its 13th flick with a respectable worldwide grossing, \"Happy Death Day\" must be considered, besides an extra proof of Blumhouse vigor and vitality, as a breath of fresh air for commercial slasher cinema, one to which, little to little, they bury it the stake further inside.The main disadvantage with the script doesn't lie in the combination of genres, otherwise, that's one of the most remarkable features of the film, the drawback is the way to tie up some loose ends, because, in fact, they are closed to so much pressure that coherence threads are abruptly detached. As a thriller, mystery whodunit, the interest of audience will be placed in the resolution of the homicide, consequently, if you want to carry the genre proudly, should manipulate the perceptions of each spectator in order to cast doubt before the more insignificant detail, here, although interesting bets are proposed in the course of the third act, the truth about who's behind the creepy mask is not a great thing at all. Fortunately, the film keeps enough vigor, dynamic and strength in montage sets, performances and narrative circumstances that make it more than energetic, fascinating and entertaining the rebirth of our protagonist anti-heroine.As writer sets on the one side of the triumphant Blumhouse balance equation, on the other side, the director acts as a counterbalance. Although Christopher Landon's name seems Lilliputian compared with film-savvies as James Wan or M. Night Shyamalan,  his most recent pic would be the first great milestone in his ascending career, even though he has a long, long way to enroll in the major leagues. Landon provides newness and daring for a film that could easily have fallen into muddy plots of aimless comedy, dysfunctional horror or soporific thriller; here, the filmmaker reveals his contemporary thinking by transmitting young-focused company MTV's \"Teen Mom\" on Tree's TV instead of any Hitchcock's or Coppola's classics; here, Landon places a female Bill Murray imprisoned in a college campus; drastic swaps that benefit the feel-good that radiates the ending of the film. Evaluating the work of the director through the final result, one could say that the man behind \"Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse\" has just gained a great improvement in terms of filmmaking and control is concerned, Every filmmaker who demonstrates a professional advancement deserves a heated ovation, however, taking into consideration Landon's labor, half of the continent must stand up and applaud him, congratulations, a future colleague.Uni and Blumhouse manage to deliver an entertaining contemporary story with honors, they can produce a five-star action thriller, abduction suspense one or murder-solving one, simply, shows off the aces up its sleeve and leap them, without clemency, on the face of the spectator. The particular montage, the nice pictures and the excellent score team up in a moderately phenomenal way, although, visually, they are restricted by the number of scenarios shown in the first twenty minutes, however, the lack of possibilities encourages productivity and originality that end up in magnificent films, in this case, it's testified through interesting camera movements, amazing angles, and very old-school approaches; the saying: creativity is the only weapon emerging from low-budget and narrative constraints is very true. The soundtrack deserves special mention, it seems to mock 80's horror flick, its stridency and apparent jocularity are mixed with the same functionality as the images, its melodies recall \"Scream\", and even, there are explicit scenes which lead to our memory, without any remedy, to Wes Craven's film; great job Bear McCreary, no doubt, the best aspect of the film.Christopher Landon's \"Happy Death Day\" positions itself on the throne of the horror and youthful-humored satire of the year, not merely because of its picturesque premise, but because of the appropriate levels of execution and narrative approach it presents. Although never taking itself too seriously, it serves as a fortifying incentive for the association between studios, verifying that they are on the right way, a path brimming with originality and magnetism that would not be defaced by low-budgets. Sadly, the film is left behind compared to its contenders, experimenting a sense of emptiness at the end of the showtime, shows that, at least narratively, has been a partially lost opportunity. Undoubtedly, Landon's film had the perfect tools to become huge, but with the result, it only got to be big. Let us blow out our candle of desires and we pray together for longevity and vitality of this alliance."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "A college student must relive the same day over and over.

It's ludicrous but if you want a little cinematic entertainment this weekend then here's your choice because it's definitely one of the better bad movies out right now. A light-hearted slasher movie just in time for Halloween. And if you still need more encouragement they've put Get Out, The Purge and The Visit on the poster for good measure.It ticks nearly all the boxes and delivers what it promises, unlike a certain other movie I saw this weekend. That's right I'm looking at you Geostorm. You've got the horror slasher movie aspect mixed with a fair amount of comedy. Unfortunately a lot of this movie has been spoiled by its own trailer which is disappointing. So if you've managed to avoid the trailer and intend on seeing Happy Death Day keep it that way. The acting isn't up to much and I don't think I recognised a single person in this. It also could have done without the whole \"well I'm reliving the same day over and over so I'm gonna re-evaluate my whole life and become a better person\" message. The biggest problem is it falls apart in the last act but what more can you expect really. A lot of horror movies suffer in the third act and Happy Death Day just descended into a mess.

But what if you were stuck in a never ending loop, where you meet your end only to wake up and start the day again? That\u2019s the premise of the recent Happy Death Day, which is similar to a dark version of Bill Murray\u2019s Groundhog Day and delivers on many levels.The film begins with a very hungover Tree, played by Jessica Rothe (La La Land, Valley Girl) who wakes up in the dorm room of Carter, played by Israel Broussard (The Bling Ring, Extinction). After a short exchange, she sets off on her walk of shame, trying to piece together the events of the night before. After seeing how she treats some of the supporting characters, we see that Tree is not up for winning any humanitarian awards. She\u2019s not only prone to waking up in strange guys\u2019 beds, but she is rude, makes out with friend\u2019s boyfriends, blows off potential suitors, partakes in an affair with one of her teachers, and treats her sorority sisters like garbage. That being said, the list of people who\u2019d like to kill her would not fit on a sticky note and leaves the viewer guessing. I haven\u2019t been this stumped by who the killer was since the original Scream.After setting off for a party, she comes face to face with our masked killer for the first time, who is dressed as a cherub in a dark hooded sweat shirt. He quickly ends her life prompting her to wake up at the beginning of the day all over again. The killer is not overly original, as a similar mask was used in the previously released Valentine movie. After a few failed attempts at circumventing her death, she becomes determined to find her killer and break this vicious cycle.The mystery of who the killer is and how the film goes about slowly leaving hints and misdirecting the viewer is where most of the fun is found, as this suffers from a lack of violence due to the PG-13 rating. While there are some creative kills that do change depending on how Tree decides to proceed with the day, most are done off-screen, leaving the gory details to the viewer\u2019s imagination. Tree\u2019s reactions are often comical and prevent the film from becoming stale, despite a number of the same scenes taking place over and over again with minor variances.While the killer\u2019s identity is revealed before the credits roll, the reason Tree is stuck in the never ending loop is never explained, which leaves a large plot hole. Since this is a horror film and the suspension of disbelief is in full effect, this shouldn\u2019t stop you from checking out what is sure to be a cult classic."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "First, I must state that I was shocked by the number of children that attended this movie.

The movie follows Theresa \"Tree\" for short, a collage student in a **** fraternity, waking up after a night of partying she heads home and lives out her day like normal, ignoring people and acting like a rude stuck up rich kid. later that night she is tracked down and killed by a baby mask wearing, knife welding stranger. then wakes up and relives the day over and over, all ending with her dying. personally i like this concept, so many ways you can take it, supernatural twist. freak rift in space and time. however this movie takes no side and never reveals why our main character is in this loop.  However after some loops she decides to tell the guy she keeps waking up with. he suggests that she needs to find the killer and that will stop the loop. which leads to a funny montage of her going to find people on a \"suspect list\" then having her die is funny ways. this comedy kinda works, me and my partner were laughing at some of these scenes pretty much because they were so weirdly silly in a dark humour kind of way then having her wake up frustrated with how many times she dies. After figuring out the killer and stopping them, Tree finally celebrates her birthday with the good guy \"Carter\" finishing up with a happy ending.ACTINGreally good actually, i didn't know any of the people in this movie, so assumed they would not be that good, and i think i was wrong i really liked the main character \"Tree\" played by Jessica Rothe i think she carried this movie being funny sad and stupidly once she starts to go a little insane by being stuck in the loop. the male love interest and good guy in this movie is \"Carter\" played by Israel Broussard, seeing as he is outside the loop most of his lines in the first act are repeated, however after he starts to believe Tree he has some good acting, being the good guy that helps solve this murder. however nothing amazing here kind of just more then i expected.DIALOGAgain not amazing, never did they have interesting conversations, about the scenes, not to mention they didn't explore the killer at all, instead of asking, \"How does this person know were you will be no matter what?\" they just gloss over it and ppast it up for a **** cliche at the end. nothing memorable here, some funny lines that will get a laugh but nothing to progress the story.OVERALLI enjoyed this movie as a slasher but not overall, i enjoyed the premise and the slasher parts but not all of it, this movie had promise to be a very interesting movie about something supernatural, however chose to stick to a more slasher type film that asks the question \"if you were in a slasher movie what would you do?\" because Tree knows she will die at the end of the day she can formulate plans to stop it. making the movie aware of the slasher tropes right down to Tree being a blonde victim. which changes by the end."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "I was thoroughly entertained by this movie.

Happy Death Day is hilarious, action-packed, suspenseful, and beyond enjoyable. I've never seen a theatre so engaged with a film, and I've never been so engaged with a slasher flick. At some points it seems very ridiculous, but I feel that adds to the charm. Nothing needs to make sense, so long as you have as much fun as possible.I only made this review because I saw the seriousness of others, and think it unfair to treat a loose, light-hearted film seriously. Happy Death Day exceeded all expectations. It made me laugh, it made me sit on the edge of my seat, and I left the theatre feeling as though I'd gotten off a roller coaster. Incredible. Loosen up, sit back, and enjoy the ride."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Although this is a clever, modern remake of \"Groundhog Day,\" this good-natured slasher has a lively spirit, charismatic characters, and some good life morals."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Happy Death Day surprised me.  It really surprised me.  And given my rapidly growing cynicism towards all of Hollywood's contrived vomit, this movie was like taking a breath of fresh air after nearly drowning in filmmaking idiocy.Happy Death Day utilizes the 'Groundhog Day' formula; that is to say, the protagonist is trapped in a day that forever repeats.  This is one of the few movies that takes advantage of that formula, however, it appears to be a growing trend.  I happen to think this is something positive since the idea of a cyclical and never-ending day can be used in a multitude of creative ways (see 'Edge of Tomorrow').But Happy Death Day does not pretend it's something unique.  In fact, Happy Death Day even manages a nod towards Groundhog Day, both humbly acknowledging where its own inspiration derived from and complimenting a phenomenal classic that should be required viewing for anyone with a pulse.And that's a big part of what makes this movie so good: it's not pretentious.  It's not trying to be something it's not.  And best of all, it's not robotic and formulaic.  While the film plods the path of the typical three act Greek outline, it does so with emotion and realism.  The characters matter.  This is a big part of what makes Happy Death Day stand out: the characters aren't fabricated on an assembly line.  They aren't caricatures.  They act like we act.  They react like we react.The cynicism I complained of at the beginning of this review has largely been cultivated by bloated budgets and overpaid arrogant blowhards who think they can force feed the moviegoing public with their computer generated scripts and lazily earn a paycheck without lifting a finger.  But this movie is anything but.  The people involved in this film made an earnest effort and it shows.Happy Death Day's storytelling is also patient and thoughtful.  The story is unfolded at an even pace and plot points that are revealed from the start are neatly tied up by the end.  Speaking of the end, it's rare that I'm surprised and/or fulfilled by an ending but this movie managed to achieve both for me.As a sidenote, I have read disparaging reviews that attack the fact that Happy Death Day \"rips off\" Groundhog Day; this is akin to lambasting every story that's had aggressive aliens since War of the Worlds.  Why is it negative if someone is inspired by someone else?  If I created something unique and others used it for their own creations, why would I take that as anything other than praise?  Attacking a plot for its similarity to something else is, on its face, ridiculous.  Plots are used and reused all the time; it is what we do with them that matters.But I will digress.  overall, I highly recommend this movie.  Remove the Hollywood preconceptions in your mind, drop the need for flashy effects and other bells and whistles and simply let it all unfold.  Hopefully, like me, you'll be left feeling very satisfied.(P.S. I gave it an 9/10 as a bit of a curve score.  In other words, if movies were metaphorically a classroom full of students, Happy Death Day would be given a higher score given that all of its classmates are flunking out.  As a movie of its own right, perhaps I'd give it a 7 or 8.)"}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Very interesting plot, but it's only a movie for fun.

In the first ten minutes, it seems kinda cool, but after that the girl keeps dying, and waking up, and dying, and waking up, and dying, and waking up, and dying, and waking up, and dying, and waking up.. Also, it is pretty obvious who wants to kill her from the very beginning of the movie. It is so pointed out that she is being such a **** to her roommate, that you can guess that it is her who wants to harm her. More over, at some points, the movie tries to hard to be funny. The only part that i smiled (not laughed), it was when her boyfriend pranked her in the end. I found the other parts really lame. It was just a disaster."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I really enjoyed this! The concept is not the most original but the interpretation is fantastic. The film is funny, charming and the story powers through never really getting boring. Sound design and filming are strong. The lead girl is charismatic and charming to watch even at the start when she isn't the nicest person. Some of the background acting isn't very good. There are some scary moments but no gore or anything lasting scary. It's more about the story, the twist and the charm."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "I dont know why this movie was promote like a terror movie,  only scare 2 times in the entire movie, the rest was only laught.

Yes, it's mix of GHD, Scream this/that, etc so you'll be on the FF button a bit, but the ending isn't the formulaic pat ending it telegraphs, there's more and we thank it for that subtle twist."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Just when you thought po-mo slasher movies couldn't possibly have anything interesting to offer anymore... This movie is a breath of fresh air, mainly because instead of spending large ponderous chunks of time setting up a feature-length story, it gets to home in one day and then have fun repeating it with a new twist each time. This makes it a breeze to sit through, and it feels as if everyone involved had a blast making it, which really rubs off on the viewer.Highly recommended by a hopelessly jaded horror fan."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "This was surprisingly awesome. One of the best slasher/horror movies I've seen in quite a long time. Not a masterpiece as it is so full of clich\u00e9s and tropes, but it seems to self aware of that and has fun with it.Not too much else to say with out spoilers. Great idea of reusing an old idea in a new way. Nice story and it did keep me guessing until the end."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "A film that is kind of a mixed bag, but there's enough to appreciate here to recommend it.
