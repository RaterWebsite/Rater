It doesn't just describe events to you, like some movies do, but it portrays it in such a way that it's genuinely chilling and believable. In comparison to Weeks, Days doesn't hold what it has over you like a bludgeon, it doesn't attempt to beat you with the speed of the zombies, or the gore. But it places it in supreme positions in the film to have the utmost effect, at the climax, at the low-point, etc. And the best part about it, is that it manages to achieve a constant level of edginess, a constant thrill even when there's nothing on the screen, it manages all of this without a guitar-blasting soundtrack (however awesome the Weeks theme is) or cameras explicitly showing that zombies are just running at you, spewing blood as they go. In fact, you are often scared in this movie simply by the fact that you don't really see what's scaring you, which is a true sign of mastery in the genre. On the other end of the spectrum, all performances in this film are excellent, the chemistry between Seline and Jim is believable especially. All characters have an edge of sympathy, and portray to you that not everyone to survive the apocalypse will be beefy, bulky men with chain guns. It defies a lot of things that would be expected of it, and ditches all normal conventions, pulling it off with grace and poise. It's a must see for anyone who can stand the level of intensity.

I daresay there hasn't been a zombie film this good since the original Dawn of the Dead.

Danny Boyle proves his versatility as a director with this movie, mixing a love story with real, intense scares. The scenery is memorable, as is the phenomenal John Murphy soundtrack.

I bet u missed that. 2) They aren't zombies they are pissed off because its not really a \"virus\" its more like people are transferring periods to each other. 3) The reason they dont attack other infected is because once you get bit...well...i uhhhhh...yea...4) The army fellows didn't want to get with the little girl as a cure, but just to rebuild the entire human race with 9 guys ad 2 girls.

In this version a virus escapes because of a raid by PETA type activists on a research facility in the UK.

But humankind may be safe after all since not one infected person strays beyond the UK so the world is safe from Perfidious Albion's latest blunder. Nothing really connects.

Cillian Murphy's acting performance does save some pieces of the movie but it wasn't enough."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "In a previous review I thumbed down this movie for I find that it is not a particular good movie. I decided to redo my review as many people argued that the stupid decisions, which was my biggest annoyance with the movie, can be explained and thus are no arguments at all.\rI do not agree with this and will try to show why this movie isn't any good and why the stupid decisions are at the heart of the problem.\r Because metacritic allows only for a limited amount of text I have to be brief and cut to the chase. But first let me say that it is no good arguing that a movie has be done before. Even if that is the case, this has nothing to do with the movie itself. Many things have been done before. As someone said, if redoing a movie makes it bad, then the universally acclaimed movie the Maltese Falcon by John Huston would fall in that category.\r A movie is a story and a story requires at least these two things: good characters and a good plot. Good characters point to believable people and believable people we can connect with, even if we don't like them. A good plot points to believable events, even if the these events are illogical in themselves.\rNote that with believable I do not mean: because it can really happen in life, but I mean: that it is accepted as being consistent with the internal logic of the story. For instance: if a story accepts that magic exists and can be used, then it stands to reason that someone can be a magic user, even though magic has not been proven to exist in real life.\rThis point makes short work of arguments as: why do the infected not attack each other? They do not because the world works that way and we do not require an explanation.\r Good characters have traits that define them. Examples can especially be found in cartoon characters. Take as example Mickey Mouse(naive and brave), Donald Duck(temperamental, committed) and Goofy(lovable, clumsy, silly, easygoing). These cartoon characters do not only posses these traits, but to a large degree these traits are part of the way they look and even move(goofy being tall, thin and moving in a clumsy manner).\r Let's turn to the central character of the movie. What traits does he display? The only trait he consistently shows throughout the movie is that he is dumb-witted to the point of being a danger to the others around him. He does not have something like the determined kick ass chick attitude of the girl he meets in the story(Selena) nor does he have the dedication and boisterous nature of the father. This then is the central character in the world with whom we have to connect and his only discerning quality is that he is too dumb be alive(for long).\r The logic of a story is grounded in the real world for we have nothing else to go on. So in general we assume that everything of the real world applies unless it is explicitly changed for the story. So we can assume that people do things like eating, drinking and having a dump without seeing them do these mundane activities in the movie. No movie requires to show you this, but we assume it happens and when it is needed for the plot it will be shown.\r Let's have a look at the plot. 28 days later abounds with stupidity. The father exposes everyone to unnecessary danger by driving his taxi through a tunnel with wrecks. They have lunch out in the open exposed. They make noise despite knowing that it attracts infected. The father exposes himself to blood, despite knowing better. Instead of holing up for the night in a room that is defensible, they use the ground floor one with windows that can be jumped through by infected. This is just a random set of the stupidity in the movie.\r Now stupidity in the world of 28 days later should lead to death and hence most of the people involved by rights die or should die. But this can not be the group of people that survive in this dangerous world. It requires qualities that allow you to survive. The characters and the plot are therefore hugely inconsistent with the world of 28 days later..\r The only survivors in the movie stay alive despite a tendency to make stupid decisions, while apparently the rest of the inhabitants of the UK, the more sensible ones presumable, were killed by the infection or something else(wise decisions?). Or perhaps they did not die at all but fled in time? This requires explanation, but we get none. Therefore this movie is bad because it doesn't explain how people survive so long while making a string of stupid mistakes.\r This is a central weakness in the movie which makes it a bad movie, despite being thought provoking(where?), despite having nice visuals(?), despite having good music, despite anything else. A movie ought to be a believable story with believable characters. They both are badly drawn in this movie, hence the movie is bad.\rNo two ways about it"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "28 Days Later is something of a modern cult classic but even so, it\u2019s hard to believe that it only came out fourteen-fifteen years ago. But then again, it\u2019s also hard to believe that it DID come out fourteen-fifteen years ago. 2007 sequel 28 Weeks Later and talk regarding a potential third and fourth series film notwithstanding, the film operates as most cult classics do so well- telling a story that is in many ways a circular journey and neatly wraps many details up while maintaining the intrigue and mystery by leaving some relatively unanswered as well. Although fans/victims of the lore and universe will know that many details and background interests have been added in the years since- comic books, graphic novels, a film sequel and more, the best part about any zombie apocalypse (besides it being horrid to be stuck in) is that anything can happen.The sixties, seventies, eighties, and even nineties all had their famous horror zombie flicks and we\u2019d seen many tall tales come and go- Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, and Day of the Dead to name a few. We\u2019ve even seen some surprisingly good films since- I Am Legend, The Crazies, Shaun of the Dead, and Dawn of the Dead (2004). 28 Days Later kicked all of this off however, and not just in the film industry. Prior to the reinvention of the classic zombie thriller-horror romp many considered the genre to be dead and buried like westerns and eighties action flicks. Afterwards however we\u2019ve been treated to a resurgence in films, literature, and even gaming. Left 4 Dead and Dead Rising are two of the bigger franchises out there and they both prominently feature the zombie apocalypse in entirely different ways.Not only is 28 Days Later a good film and a good example of what to do in terms of filming the zombie uprising, but it deserves its status as a cult classic because it is both a harrowing experience against WWZ-like zombies and it is a cinematic experience that should be appreciated to the fullest. The camera work in Danny Boyle\u2019s zombie thriller is spectacular- both in the long pans across the desolate London horizon and the tense emotions elicited throughout every chase sequence and encounter. Although it reestablishes the now commonplace trope that humans are their own worst enemy even in the dead uprising, 28 Days Later focuses both on the visceral feelings and emotions of mankind in reaction to the dead and undead as well.Although we\u2019ve been treated to two feature-length films that tell pretty decent stories within their own version of the zombie apocalypse, I\u2019m really excited for what the future might hold for a series such as 28 ___ Later especially in the wake of the immense success of shows such as The Walking Dead (and the Kirkman comics). I would love nothing more than to see yet another quality zombie game released set in a similarly dark and gritty world to the films and perhaps even set within the same universe and utilizing some of the abundant lore as well. So far we\u2019ve been given Zombi (originally for Wii U) which is probably the closest we\u2019ve yet come to a fully realized and detailed experience in the vein of 28 Days Later, and that game was decent for what it offered in interesting gimmicks and mechanics.I\u2019m doing my best not to really spoil the great narrative even though it\u2019s probably considered a bit cliche nowadays- not at the time, considering it is what so many movies now base themselves off of it seems. Not only is it a fully worthwhile and fundamental stroke of genius in terms of storytelling and cinematography, the acting itself is pretty spot on and the relatively unknown actors (besides Brendan Gleeson and Chris Eccleston) sell their roles perfectly. The 2004 version of Dawn of the Dead may be one of the most recognizable and pretty decent zombie films of the early 2000s, but let\u2019s not forget the fact that 28 Days Later started things off right and paved the way not only for the shambling dead but the night-roaming mutants of I Am Legend as well. All things said and done, Boyle\u2019s film would\u2019ve also been fine without a sequel but expanding the 28 universe hasn\u2019t been the worst idea either."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "A classic zombie movie.

The plot is quite similar to so many. Mostly like every zombie movie ever made. Along the way he meets some survivors which include a truly bad ass Naomie Harris (Pirates of the Carribean 2&3) and they try and find help. A radio broadcast leads them to a group of soldiers with questionable intentions. There's nothing really new here plot wise but the execution is creatively stunning. The grainy, sort if found footage style easily immerses you into the events on screen and it's both terrifying and addictive. The movie is also emotionally effective because the characters and their plight are well developed.

The acting, writing, cinematography, music were all top notch. As a horror film this one is a one of a kind. Its real ability to scare its audience has little to do with typical horror movie conventions, although it does manage a moment here and there, such as the church scene (especially the moment when ..... [reference deleted]). However, this film's perspective on human nature is where it achieves the most scares. From the well meaning animal rights group in the beginning of the film to Jim's rampage at its end (which has entered into my all time favorite movie scenes), no one in this film is free of sin, an inherently violent nature or accountability for their actions. The Rage disease is just a medium for human nature to act out it's most primal inclinations, which seems to be aimed at harming other human beings. The third section of the film which takes place at a manor house under the \"protection\" of a small military group only confirms these tendancies. The soldiers actions towards our heroes (especially the women) drives home the idea that humans don't need to necessarily be infected with Rage to canabalize upon each other."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This movie is more than a zombie horror flick if you ask me. It really revolutionized the apocalyptic thriller in many places. It's much more fast-paced in that the \"zombies\" if you will, don't hobble after you and moan. They sprint and the chances of survival are much less. There's also an eerie feeling a claustrophobia at the beginning of the movie, even though the main character is out in the open with London to himself. It also creates characters that you begin to love, and hate. There's a thing about how people killing people is how it's always been and that they're in a state of normality even with the crazies running around.

This claim is open for interpretation and might imply that our kind's rage against one another will eventually lead to our own apocalypse. Another character suggests that due to the short time men have inhabitated Earth, the world will go back to normalcy after the extinction of the humans.
