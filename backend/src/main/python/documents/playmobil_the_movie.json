      "text": "I couldn't do it. I couldn't make through this and I've made arguably worse B-Movie. I rented Playmobil: The Movie thinking it would be bad. I figured it would be the fun or weird type of bad (or a guilty pleasure), but no this movie is boring which in my opinion is a lot worse.This also made me realize just how boring Playmobil was. (I didn't really grow up playing with Playmobil besides a few figures.) Playmobil even as toys lacks a personality besides be the lesser of Lego. Playmobil also cannot use copyrighted characters as they simply do not have any.It is also a bit annoying with the songs. Clearly this movie was made for a very young audience (toddlers) instead of all ages as The Lego Movie was. So, I mean the targeted audience would probably like it or at least be distracted by it.I can't wait until The Mega Bloks Movie."

By the way, read that Playmobil Movie was in the works conceptually way before the Lego Movie, but there were some issues that caused major delays. So although it was not as strong as the Lego Movie, it was not trying to copy it."
