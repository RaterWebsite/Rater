You'd better watch it, it's worth your time!"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This won my \"Best Movie of 2009.\" When it comes to funny movies, here is what I LOVE: incredibly smart humor about the stupid, mundane & ridiculous. I am baffled that only 75% of users like this movie."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I wasn't a huge fan of Knocked Up, but I felt this movie was very funny in comparison. The dialogue was witty and the characters and situations seemed real. They didn't portray the anti-hero as an evil slime, but rather just a normal guy that you might actually know and like. I think it could have done without some of its full frontal male nudity."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Nudity, more often than not, is gratuitious. An eyeful. Eye-candy. Like Eva Green in Bernardo Bertolucci's \"The Dreamers\", for starters. She's Milky Way, all the way. Jason Siegel, on the other hand; he's a Milk Dud, a dude. Be forewarned: Siegel goes full-frontal in \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\", but his full-monty ain't gratuitous. His state of nature; it's a metaphor, a writerly confession expressed in the biblical sense. Showing off your untamed body to the whole of North America, voluntarily(Siegel wrote it), differs from somebody else ordering you to strip for the voyuers in the dark. Although it may look like that Siegel's sharing his flaccid penis and ball sac for cheap laughs, in actuality, he's showing us his heart laid bare. His very soul. You'll get the sense that \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\" must mean something to him. He lived through this. To the writer/star, deep down, he probably doesn't find this whole comedic enterprise funny at all. Proof, you say? Late in the film, Peter Bretter(Siegel) says(of his rock opera), \"I didn't realize it was a comedy.\" To its creator, \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\" is probably an act of catharsis. A confessional. And what a funny confession of self-loathing this scurrilous, but unexpectedly sweet comedy, turned out to be."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "First of all, Apatow didn't direct or write this movie. Saying that this is the weakest of the Apatow movies is therefore a wee bit incorrect. This was a very good, heartfelt comedy that, when compared to the movies of the same cast, settles in nicely between Superbad and Knocked Up. Segel's great first screenplay and adequate performance on screen really make this movie shine. Brand's performance as the British sex god is possibly one of the funniest roles in any 'Apatow' movies thus far."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Lots of really funny moments and quirky characters- Brand in particular-make this a worthwhile movie to rent. The CSI parodies are a scream!"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "A great movie overall. It was funny enough, while not reaching similar heights as some other rated R comedies, it had a bit of subtle humor that was much appreciated (Russell Brand). To me, each of the main characters came off as very likeable and interesting to watch. I was always looking forward to their chemistry together.

Some stuff was kinda bizarre which just adds to the humor.

When Peter learns that Sarah and her new boyfriend Aldous Snow are staying in Hawaii (at the same resort he is) things begin to get awkward for Peter and Sarah, but with the help of Rachel the hotel receptionist and different island locals Peter may be able to get over his break up with Sarah before the end of the trip.Forgetting Sarah Marshall has the Apatow Productions tag on it, and it looks and feels very similar to a lot of other Judd Apatow produced films. The storyline is a well established; it is a break centered story about two characters that were no longer meant to be together. Forgetting Sarah Marshall as a film does a good job of telling its stories, with a few great laughable scenes as well as some very emotional moments between Peter and SarahWritten by How I Met Your Mother star Jason Segel, Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a realistic spin on the romantic comedy genre. In most romantic comedies the couple is breaking up but it is strictly a result of one of the parties involved. With this film it is much more than that, we see during one of the many tense scenes between Peter and Sarah that they both had faults and there was stuff going on in their relationship that they both were unhappy with. It made the film feel that much more real and engaging simply because you realize that despite the fact you want to see Peter rebound and figure his life out, he is not perfect and could have tried a little harder at times. Jason Segel who both wrote and starred in the film, proves that he is more than just a great comedic actor, he is also an off the wall comedic writer. He proves that you can get rid of some of the old adages of a certain genre while keeping the core foundations of a good film to fit into said genre. Segel makes the dramatics of the break up in what is classified still as a romantic comedy. Segel also proves to have great chemistry with his cast mates, most notably, Mila Kunis. At times it may be a stretch to believe a romance can fully blossom over a week or so, but in this case it seemed legit. At first it was different between the two, she was the girl who worked at the hotel and did not want to see him sad or weeping anymore and so she hung out with him offered him companionship. The relationship between Peter and Rachel on screen is one that makes sense, despite the fact you know that the relationship may end up going a little faster than most. It is easy to believe in Jason Segel and Mila Kunis falling for each other on screen because it comes off as natural and charismatic between the two of them. None of their scenes seem forced or unbelievable, so kudos to both of them to making what has become a clich\u00c3\u00a9 of the rom com genre not so tedious and apocryphal.Like most other comedies, Forgetting Sarah Marshall has that set of supporting characters that are far more memorable than any of the leads. Russell Brand is whacky and off the wall; his character of Aldous Snow is definitely memorable. Brand plays the self indulgent rock star perfectly; Snow is a man who tries to give people life advice when he really does not have a handle on his own life. Brand is good in the role, because he has that rock star image himself. Paul Rudd does a good job as Chuck the surfer dude, he has a very small part, but there are a few scenes involving him that are funny. However it was Jonah Hill as the awkward restaurant waiter that got a few good laughs. His awkward attempts to be recognized by some one of Aldous Snow\u00e2"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "10 / 10 ,  and  that's  just  Mila  Kunis ,  the  film  is  pretty  good  aswell ...................................................................."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "It is an absolutely perfect romantic comedy with a great script and some stellar comedic acting."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Jason Segal and Mila Kunis have just enough chemistry to almost pull off this sporadically funny, raunchy comedy.

It's such a great film with so many lovable characters and it'll leave you with a warm feeling inside. Loads of brilliant scenes and unforgettable quotes. All set on beautiful Hawaii as well, which makes the film seem even brighter and adds to the feel good factor. Not usually a fan of Russell Brand but his character in this is spot on and has some brilliant lines. A film for Apatow fans too, with the likes of Jonah Hill popping up. Loved every second of it."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Hard for me to believe anyone thought this was a good movie. The dialogue itself was dull and badly written.

I walked out on it, not because it was that dreadful, but rather because my expectations were set so high and I was gravely disappointed. This story is about as predictable as one can imagine. Beyond that, the Judd Apatow gang makes scoring incredibly beautiful women seem like anything a pasty, pale chubster can do with ease. So why is this character so tortured to lose his hot girlfriend? He is shown in bed with a series of stunning women right after his breakup. I also found the repetition of cut shots of the main character weeping...on the balcony, on the floor, on his couch, as he slaughters a pig, etc. as being way too overused as a fallback joke when there was too much dead story-telling. Not only does our protagonist end up with an equally stunning new mate, he does so with ease and without missing a beat....so what is the title about again?"}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Ehh.... nothing special.
