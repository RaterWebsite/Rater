Spoiler Alert.... Wow, the first 11 user votes have got to be from shills. Add to that Roger Ebert who says the film \"only seems to cheat\". What?!?! Is he an independant critic or a paid advertisement? He is smarter than that... This film is the very example of cheating. Similar to overuse of the \"dream sequence\", where the audience is suckered into believing some incredible plot line only to find out it was all a dream, this movie feeds you hook line and sinker with no possible misreading or \"other explanation\" behind the reveal. By complete trickery we are lead to believe that the actual killers could not POSSIBLY be the actual killers. The only way to justify this trickery is for us as the audience to understand, unequivocally, from the beginning, that the whole movie is a play on itself. In my opinion we are unaware until the tricks are revealed. Which means that the movie completely relies on trickery. We catch a few quirky clues early on like the red snapper joke and some references to screen writing, but that is not enough for us to understand that the whole thing is a farce. This could have been a great movie if presented as farce. IMO the farce isn't completely revealed until the lead realizes his hands are so mangled he can't hold a gun. Now that's funny. Why not clue us in on that early enough that it gets a good laugh instead of a huge sigh? Then we find out that the killers were putting on a great act. That's fine. But we the viewers, from the omniscient point of view we are given, should have known it was an act. Instead we were deliberately tricked. Omniscience and trickery are mutually exclusive. If we see everything then we can't be tricked. But we are. We are deliberately shown some things that are not true. It is OK to mislead the audience by selectively showing or not showing certain elements, but when the omniscient viewer sees something that is patently false in order to trick him/her...this is bad storytelling. This type of trickery is a textbook no-no and for good reason. This is an insult to the reader/viewer and must be done with great care. There is no care here in my opinion, only insult. I give the 3 just for the scenery which is beautiful. The rest is a disaster."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "The best horror movie so far this year."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Okay, so the twist is predictable, but the movie is still tons of fun."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "I simply CANNOT understand what engaged the people who rated this movie highly.

Probably more like an 8. But you all giving it a 1 or 3 need shot. Yes, I considered them to be the killers even before I started watching, but you just don't know for sure. You're guessing thru 2/3 of the movie... you're thinkin well it could be one of 3 couples and any of them really won't be a huge surprise, but that doesnt make it a bad movie. I'm thinking the only reason some on here (mikemike) give this movie a bad rating is because they're thinking it needs more of a twist. For me the big twist was her (Jovovich) turning on her partner at the end. With the overwhelming fill of plot twisting movies out, who's not going to consider the main characters as the killers...duh! That was the intention, so as if to try triple reverse psychology on you. And I feel it works good. There's no way anyone could lock it in as them being the killers until the videocam scene. Unless ofcourse someone gave you a hint before you watched it. And there's no way you could rule out the other couples. If it would've turned out as the other couple as the killers, some of you would still be retorting the same ole cries and IMHO, can't appreciate a good movie."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Silly and suspenseful"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I thought it was well acted and the story line was interesting.

Yes, you can guess most of the plot twists well in advance, and yes, some of the 'twists' defy logic. But it's decently acted, well shot in a beautiful setting, and doesn't take itself TOO seriously.

That's how long into the film I was when I knew who the killers were. Movies with a \"twist\" need to be a lot smarter than this. It was obvious to me during the scene in the jeep at the beginning that they were getting their stories straight. Add to that the fact that the other two couples are SO obviously being portrayed in a way to make you suspect them. I'm sorry, a few tattoos and wild hair do not a killer make. Any time you'd start to maybe think that you were being misled, there would be some more obvious double-sided dialogue between Cliff and Sydney. That being said, the movie was decent enough to watch. The cast is great and Olyphant really carries the movie. So, decent popcorn fare, but not at all suspenseful. I'd expect much better from the guy who gave us Pitch Black."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "A few good twists in this one keep you guessing.

The setting and the two male lead characters, played by Olyphant and Zhan, were the best parts of this movie. The script was horrible, with the twist coming very cheaply and at the expense of earlier contradicting lines and scenes (don't want to spoil it, but the twist doesn't work at all - it is actually totally laughable). If you want this movie to make sense, fall head first from over 30 feet onto some concrete, and quickly hit the play button. Add to that that the two female leads couldn't act straight - both putting on non-native accents and it showed. Shocked that anyone thought this was an acceptable movie.

Really, a rarity in horror/suspense films, a film that shoots for something other than gore and shock. Even a compelling deep psychological angle.... I can't say enough about this surprisingly engaging film! I encourage people to get out there and see this film; in the wake of crap like Transformers and G.I.

And yes, it's been done before but rarely with this much glee! The thing that makes it so damn enjoyable is seeing Steve Zahn, Timothy Olyphant & Milla Jovovich sink their teeth into roles that show they can ACT THEIR A**ES OFF. I mean, I got goosebumps in the latter third of the film with all the shifts and shadings their characters go through. And Kiele Sanchez's goat gutting scene is a star making turn in and of itself! It's a great guilty pleasure and beats the hell out that Harry Potter snore-fest thingy in the other theater!"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Better than expected!

What was Roger Ebert thinking when he wrote that review!? Anyone who couldn't see where this was headed from about the 8 minute mark was paying more attention to their popcorn than the movie.

Back in the shanty town, the moviegoer sees a class struggle in the making when they first meet the local residents. But it's just a matter of time before Bobby(Ned Beatty), the surly one, is put in his place. The city slicker soon rues the moment he tells a hillbilly, \"I like your hat.\" In \"A Perfect Getaway\", the outsiders seek their deliverance from the Kalalau Trail on the island of Kauai. This time it's newlyweds(played by Steve Zahn and Milla Jonovich), a screenwriter and his blushing bride who go rural, and encounter, not just the islanders, but stateside couples of a lesser pedigree, which creates the same class struggle found in the Boorman film. Seemingly out of their elements, Cliff and Cydney make the classic mistake of befriending the wrong people, a thriller staple, but the filmmaker never goes on automatic pilot; he composes with soft focus photography to give a sense of ambiguity at key moments whenever both couples are within the same frame. Whereas in \"Deliverance\", the person of perceived lower class asserts his dominance by violating Bobby(\"squeal like a pig\") in the woods, therefore transforming class struggle into class warfare: Gina(Kiele Sanchez), a Georgian just like the hicks in the Boorman film, intimidates Cliff and Cydney when the country woman processes a goat into food, where she violates the animal(that Nick, played by Timothy Olyphant, had slain) with her hands for its innards. Like a natural born killer, she shows no remorse. But are Cliff and Cydney really intimidated? Is there a social hierarchy? In \"A Perfect Getaway\", the screenwriter and his wife, unlike the four men in the 1972 film starring Burt Reynolds, get their deliverance not just from the primitive setting, but from each other, as well."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "I don't get the great reviews for this movie. Apparently if you like David Twohy's previous work (which I do), you must feel compelled to look upon this more favorably. What was so special about it, or that you hadn't seen before...multiple times? Almost any episode of Lost has better Hawaiian scenery, as well as better plot twists to boot. Nick's character was the only one that was even remotely memorable, no one else was particularly charismatic, attractive (this has to be the least number of bikinis in a beach movie ever), or really even worth a second thought. The twist was cute, and while it wasn't exactly expected, you obviously knew something was going to happen, and since it wasn't set up well at all, it really wasn't a surprise (nor really made an ounce of sense). The box office numbers got this one a lot more correct than the metacritic scores.

It\u00e2"}, {"rating": "3", "text": "I recently had a discussion about Milla Jovovich with several other film fanatics and whether or not she has a place in Hollywood after churning out quite a large volume of bad movies. I argued that her roles in films like The Fifth Element, Stone and even her minuscule part in Zoolander made up for all the bad. Many did not agree. However I find myself reaching the precipice. I understand that Jovovich loves cult material, hence her participation in the horrendous Ultraviolet, and B movie throwbacks but by this point she should at least be able to tell the difference between bad cult movies and good ones. A Perfect Getaway acts as a throwback to the B movie horror films of yesteryear but does so in a way void of both reason and logic. The plot is to put it bluntly, stupid. The film relies on pointing out film cliches like 'the red herring' to hide the fact the films red herring (you will know it when you see it) is incredibly simple minded. The dialogue between the characters however is actually quite good, the relationships built in the film feel real which says a lot in a film that is absent a coherent story. The cast is respectable with a few surprisingly good performances (Kiele Sanchez, Timothy Olyphant). However the use of both Chris Hemsworth and Marley Shelton for such small performances seems like a waste of potential. Milla Jovovich has the best character to work with but she never really takes advantage. The weak link is Steve  Zahn who's straight laced screenwriter character grates making him a dreadful lead considering most of the film follows him. The direction (by Pitch Black's David Twohy) is acceptable but never surprising or anything more than what is required. It is a soul crushingly mundane movie that never lives up to the B movies it is trying to emulate."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "This is not a bad movie, however the big twist wasn't such a surprise.

So to me it worked really well."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "A Perfect Getaway: 7 out of 10: For a slow moving thriller that cheats\u2026 a little, A Perfect Getaway isn't that bad. It has gorgeous cinematography and while it moves slowly, it successfully builds up tension with character development rather than relying on black cats jumping out of closets or severed body parts every ten minutes.\r The tale is about three couples in Hawaii and one couple could be a pair of murders from the big island.\r Our protagonist couple (Steve Zahn and Milla Jovovich) is a bit nerdy and a bit goofy. Jovovich in particular gives a wonderfully awkward performance in body language and facial expressions.\r Trying to get into the Hawaii spirit our protagonist honeymooners attempt to do a favor for a second couple hitchhiking (Marley Shelton and Chris Hemsworth), but Hemsworth gives off such a bad vibe that the Zahn and Jovovich are naturally concerned about running into him on the trail again.\r They take refuge with the \"cool\" couple (Timothy Olyphant and Kiele Sanchez). Olyphant in particular simply cascades charisma onto the screen even when attempting to convince others he has a plate in his head from his Special Forces days. But even the cool couple could just as easily be the killers (after all Olyphant seems to like fondling his Special Forces knife a bit two much and this is a movie.) All this interaction is among well placed news reports that a non-descriptive couple is wanted for questioning for a murder and are suspected in being on the same trail as our plucky honeymooners.\r Director David Twohy isn't back in Pitch Black form but he shows a surer directing hand than he did in Chronicles of Riddick and he gets better performances out of his actors than he did in Below. In fact for a movie with basically six people and very little action the film rests almost exclusively on the actor's shoulders. The actors certainly hold up their end of the bargain across the board.\r The movie does cheat a bit as I stated before but this is a thriller rather than a mystery (after all there are only three couples in the whole film) and the journey is more fun than the reveal. In fact the movie has such a relaxed pace and vibe you can easily forget it is a thriller at all.
