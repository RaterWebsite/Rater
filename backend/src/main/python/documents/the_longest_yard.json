Had it's funny parts and it was good for about the first 1/2 of the film before it once again (like every Happy Madison production) became corny and generic.

You can find this movie funny or not, but there is NO STORYLINE WHATSOEVER ! Honestly you have to be football fan and have a lot of pop-corn and friends aruond you if you want to spend a good time with this movie. lame."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "If you're a teenager and love American football and smoke joints: you can give a shot to this movie, since it is well-acted, but buy an illegal DVD instead of giving money to stupid filmmakers. The jokes are not great but the first part, with the car chase, is funny. Then Adam plays the hero, he's ok but not as good as when playing the anti-hero. If you're not a teenager and you have a brain, even high you should AVOID this movie ! After a nice beginning, you will be annoyed by easy jokes until you eventually totally fall asleep in front of a looooong game of American football. Totally dumb, should be a 1 half an hour movie for such emptiness."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "Lame. This prison is irrealictic. Watch Animal Factory for a better insight. This comedy is not very funny. Watch White Chick for truly funny stupid American jokes. Adam Sandler is not a charismatic hero. Watch any other Sandler movie to see him as a great looser, so much suited to him. Oh I like Adam and he plays well here, but he's just not charismatic. He's great as a sympathetic drunko the first minutes, but as a leader... pff. The football game part feels almost as long as a real one. Why don't you watch a real game ? The usual good feelings, petty morals, and happy ending, so dear to Hollywood cinema, sweeten a comedy already sweet at first. A family treat BEEERK."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "There is very little about this movie that is funny. Humorous is the best it gets in a few spots.

It is funny."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "This pitiful remake was even worse than the self-consciously mediocre original.

Apparently not."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "This is the definition of an Adam Sandler movie. It has some very funny scenes, but the scenarios are ridiculous and never would actually happen, the writing is very low on any sort of intelligence, and Sandler's performance is mediocre at best."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This is the best movie in the hole world. i have watched it over and over and over again and i never get boared. if only every movie was as good as this one."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Its the best movie ever."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Hey, I'm a movie critic.

I thought it was funny to the max. One of the best scense I like the most is when Adam Sandler makes fun of that one short guy with the big ears. WOW that was great. Of course the prison is not realsic and I think the movie did want to make it realict, Come on people its a comandy, Its not to be realsict, thats why its funny haha love the black guy that gives out Mac donlads haha loved that. Well I give this 10, for the sweet hits and funny scenes."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Adam Sandlar stars in an inserting role as a confused ex-football pro whose life gets turned upside down after he is arrested and sentenced to prison for drinking and driving with a vehicle he stole from his girlfriend. The first 15 minutes of the film are boring and leave the viewer indifferent. The jokes become more and more ridiculous as the plot unravels in a federal state prison. Sandlar continues to drain out his performance as a boring, heartless man while James Cromwell, Burt Reynolds, and Chris Rock essentially convey grand performances as very interesting and at times hilarious people. Seeing Sandlar"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This was an absolutely outstanding movie."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Very funny. Although the faces may look familiar, it's not quite a typical Adam Sandler movie like Little Nicky or Billy Madison. It has it's good jokes, it's cheap jokes, it's solemn moments, it's tense moments, and protagonist has a nice \"likable\" feel to them. I've never seen the original, so I won't compare. But either way, I reccomend this movie."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Excellent movie,very well done,i liked the beginning the most were he crashs his girlfriends car."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "First of all for all haters out there ya'll need to stop because the actors on the longest yard did they thang. They were very funny and they worked extra hard too. That movie was very funny to me, Chris and Adam are so talented. But Nelly did his thang on the scene too, I never seen that man act so well and he was lookin' good too. Good job Nelly, keep it up and keep the haters comin' too."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Has its moments, but all in all does not match up to the original."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Adam Sandler and Chris Rock use their own expertise in comedy to inject a fair few laughs into this amusing (and, at one point, sad) flick. It will appeal to footballers and comedy-lovers alike."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "A very surprising comedy with darker tones than other Adam Sandler and Happy Madison movies, and honestly I didn't mind, although one or two of the more dramatic moments feel out of place or poorly handled, it's still a fantastic movie, Adam Sandler gave an amazing performance, and the whole thing kept me hooked until the end, and in my opinion this is a must see."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "It was a ok movie. I'm not to fond of the remakes, some movies just need to be left alone. This remake wasn't to bad, it keep almost to the original storyline,which make it worth watching. It had a also an all-star cast of actors. It's worth seeing,but not paying top dollar for."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "It was rather funny and enjoyable up until the last 1/3 or so of the movie when it became far too serious for it's own good and lost every bit of funniness to it.

Juvenile humor, product placements, and sports jokes."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "The Longest Yard was the second best movie I've seen that starred Adam Sandler (first being Happy Gilmore), and I'm surprised that Burt Reynolds wanted to star in the film, because his character had to get rammed by one of the guards. Sure they used effects, but still, he's pretty old now."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I'm not a huge football fan, but I love a good football comedy. The Longest Yard is as good as any. I never watched the original film but I think its cool to bring back Burt Reynolds who was the star of the original movie from 1974. This movie features Adam Sandler who was at the top of his game as an actor and producer and some of his common collaborators like Chris Rock ( who may be the best character in the film) and Terry Crews as the hilarious Cheeseburger Eddie. The Longest Yard has an outstanding cast overall with several funny characters and despite its clich\u00e9s it still manages to be as strong of a sport comedy as they come. This film has made the rounds on cable television numerous times after 10 years and if you've never seen it tune in sometime."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "A rapper, Nelly, professional wrestlers Bill Goldberg, Bob Sapp, Dalip Singh (The Great Khali), and \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin, and NFL stars Michael Irvin, Terry Crews, and Brian Bosworth, are the heart of The Longest Yard. The athletes' here have screen presence to spare, and the movie oozes with goofy machismo."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "longer than it accounts for..The Longest Yard1 And A Half Out Of 5The Longest Yard is a misguided plot driven feature whose fatal attempts to install humor forcibly gives it away within few minutes. As one does assume, the tone is similar as any other Sandler feature does and so does the humor and characters offered in here. It is short on technical aspects like sound department, background score, editing, costume and production design. The writing is weak and relies a lot upon the adaptation (except for humor) and offers a very little fresh perspective to feed upon. The updated screenplay might be funnier in its own terms but isn't something that holds the viewers and the primary reason would be its sometimes cheap humor and ludicrous attempts to draw in the laughs fails on whole life. Peter Segal; the director, requires some more work on the execution skills for it is uneven and loosely scattered around varied sequences. The performance by Adam Sandler is decent as he draws out most of the laughs but his supporting cast like Chris Rock and Burt Reynolds didn't seem in their A game. The Longest Yard is actually longer than it accounts for, as the blurred out vision of the destination never clears up for the makers."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "No he visto la original de 1974, pero juzg\u00e1ndola como pel\u00edcula como tal por sus propios m\u00e9ritos puedo decir que zafa. Cumple a medias tanto como pel\u00edcula de prisi\u00f3n, como de deporte. Tiene algunos momentos que valen la pena ver, pero se hace demasiado predecible, algunos chistes son malos, y nunca se nos explica porque el alcalde quer\u00eda ganar a toda costa el partido. Ademas de que la primera parte de la pel\u00edcula solo es una mera excusa para dar un conflicto. De hecho, nunca se vuelve a mencionar a la esposa del protagonista ni nada, as\u00ed que esta parte podr\u00eda haber sobrado totalmente."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Is a real masterpiece.
