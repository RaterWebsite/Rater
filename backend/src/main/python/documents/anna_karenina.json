Everything is according to Tolstoy, the actors are brilliant, however the director afforded himself to add a thing of his own to the film  every scene of the film was a scene in a theatre! That is nonsense, Tolstoy didn't write that...  And only this director-made 'feature' made of  the film almost a total bull***t. Whithout that 'feature' the film would be great."

Wright's unique and beautifully conceived version of the film, using Tom Stoppard's intelligent adaptation, struck me as perfect for rendering the depth and complexity of the story.  The \"artifice\" of the setting, design and art direction are brought forth with sensitivity and satisfying wholeness.  Highly, highly recommended for adults who want to participate in the construction of a wonderful film and story."

      "text": "This adaptation of Tolstoy's novel is neither literal nor reverent--it is inspired.  Using stage sets (the Maryinsky Theatre in Petersburg, I think) to represent the strictures of society and bureaucracy, the film allows its characters to break out only through passion (Anna and Vronsky) or dedication (Levin and Kitty).  This method allows Stoppard (script) and Wright (direction) to serve Tolstoy's genius without suppressing their own.  This could seem too schematic, but the actors bring it all to life.  Beautiful, brilliant, unforgettable."

The acting is ok although Jude Law really did a fine job, but Knightly has really overplayed her role to the point of laughter at her emoting. But mostly Stoppard has turned a fine literary work into something laughable. The costuming is lovely, and the choreography is much overdone-it looks foppish. Vrovsky is portrayed often as a gay blade. If there is one film to be missed this season, this is it."

Admittedly, she wan't bad...until she opened her mouth. In truth, the film would've been much richer had it been a silent one. Wright never fails visually. There is no doubting that this adaptation is ambitious and imaginative, but, in the physical world, one's ambitions are nearly always unmet. I found myself cringing during dialogue. Tom Stoppard is an extraordinary writer, but neither him nor Wright were good conductors of Tolstoy's ideas. The script seemed unaware of the vision, and the vision of the words. I felt as if I was listening to a high school literature teacher, finger on the fast-forward button, struggle to hit all the major plot points of a book-on-tape. The dialogue only served to make the story feel rushed and the viewer spoon-fed. Setting it in a theatre was brilliant, but the too-literalness of this literary classic was not."

By focusing on staging the story as a play inside a play, rather than telling the tale as a novel the result was to pull me away from all the characters. I even yearned for Anna to go to the station much more quickly than she did. The choice for Vronsky was a poor one, all blond mustache and little macho, and Knightley's straying upper lip always distracts me. If I'd wanted to see the bloody thing on stage I'd have gone to a theatre, not a cinema."

Each scene transition took them back into a theatre as if we were watching a play, and then it would often transform into real life from a stage with backdrops.  There's also many scenes where the characters are in a theatre audience, but are in a setting that wouldn't actually be in a theatre, eg the horse race scene.    I think the point of this was to keep it interesting and intriguing, since this could have been a very boring movie.  They did a good job keeping it from being boring.  I loved looking at all the beautiful costumes, which is always the best part of a period movie.  I would recommend the movie, just don't expect to come out of it in a cheery mood.  It's far from a comedy."

The camera loves Keira Knightley, as Anna Karenina, just as much as Keira Knightley loves the camera.  Jude Law, as her cuckolded  husband, gives the best performance in the film and 20 years ago would have played  her lover, Vronsky, bringing more fire, looks and chemistry to the role than does Aaron Taylor-Johnson.\r Whether it is the concept of the screenplay by the world famous playwright Tom Stoppard and/or the director Joe Wright, based on the even more famous novel by Leo Tolstoy, the novelty of staging it as a play, using every nook and cranny of a theatre, very quickly falls flat and takes you out of the story just as Wright goes outside the theatre too many times. At times it seems like an opera, operetta or musical theatre without songs being sung. At times you find yourself counting the costume changes by Anna and Vronsky trying to see who accomplishes the most and there are a lot. In some scenes costume changes are stylistic which is intriguing at first but then, sadly, like the movie, becomes boring.\r There are many roles in the film but the more prominent are Matthew Macfadyen as Anna"

Imaginitively and boldly directed within a theatre setting, Joe Wright elicits a good performance from Keira Knightley (who always seems to walk a tightrope between good and bad in her films) and a scene stealing performance from Jude Law as her betrayed husband.  Beautiful and underrated the film rewards an audience prepared to wait for the gradual unfolding.  Knightley certainly gets better the longer she inhabits the character.

      "text": "Storyline: This is a period drama set in 19th century Russia. Anna Karenina (Keira Knightley) starts an affair with Count Vronsky (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) while Anna's husband (Jude Law) starts to see the signs and hear rumours of it. The style and way this film has been made is a really good idea as it's a sort of movie/stage-play hybrid with sets being changed on screen but the effect is great to watch.\r Acting: Keira Knightley appeared to be in her element playing Anna. Aaron Tylor-Johnson is a very versatile actor and looks as good playing a Russian count as he does a super hero. Matthew Macfadyen who is better known in the UK than the US seemed very comfortable in his role as Oblonsky. I really liked Jude Law as the long suffering husband and think he just gets better with each film. Kelly MacDonald as Dolly was also good, in fact there is a lot of well known talent in minor roles but everyone is performing as if it's the role of a lifetime.\r Direction: Joe Wright has clearly put his stamp on this with creative long takes and plenty going on like the ballroom scene which was amazing to watch. The music was used to great effect to and together made this a true Joe Wright movie.\r Production: The cinematography by Seamus McGarvey (Avengers & We Need To Talk About Kevin) was brilliant and the Oscar nomination is well deserved. The wardrobe and make-up are also particularly good as you would expect on a movie like this but they were above par I would say.\r Conclusion: I don't normally watch this type of film but Kelly MacDonald in a Joe Wright flik made this a 'must see' for me and also nominated for an Oscar. I'm so glad I did. Recommended Score: 7.5/10"

      "text": "Beautifully shot using a very theatrical style. In fact the majority of the action uses a theatre as its backdrop and I even spotted a section of stop-motion animation at one point. Sumptuous costumes, for which it won an Oscar, and some brilliantly choreographed set pieces are the backbone of this production. Of course we must not forget it is a drama and there\u2019s plenty of that with some really excellent performances to back it up. Keira Knightly went up in my estimation with this one; as did Jude Law; they both put in great performances. Also worthy of note was Aaron Taylor-Johnson; who I have watched with interest over the past few years and is rapidly growing into a very fine actor  yes, he is that guy from \u2018Kick-Ass\u2019). I was a little concerned that it may be a case of \u2018style over substance\u2019, but as it wore on I became more and more engrossed in the characters and the storyline. I guess this shows that the drama did manage to shine through (at least for me). The only thing that let it down was the fact the sub-plot involving Levin and Kitty didn\u2019t really have a lot to do with Anna and Vronsky by the time we saw the last of them; it seemed a little disjointed. Over all though, a very worthy watch and one, I\u2019m sure my sister would definitely enjoy!\r SteelMonster\u2019s verdict: RECOMMENDED\r My score: 7.7/10."

      "text": "Joe Wright, director of this version of the Tolstoy classic, has chosen to emphasize the theatrical nature of the period by setting most of the locations in a theatre: on stage, backstage and in the house. This sometimes creates a flowing, dancelike style that harkens to Luhrmann and Fellini. It also gets in the way of creating a cohesive and moving experience. Some of the scenery and all of the costumes are stunning. The performers do nicely, but the fervor that should drive the drama is uneven."

      "text": "Anna Karenina is a powerful story of marital duty and obligation versus lustful passion and the pursuit of personal, if not egomaniacal, happiness. It is a popular theme. Every time I went to the video store to rent it, every single copy was out, even though the allotted shelf space was that which is usually reserved for blockbusters. When I finally procured a copy that had just been returned one minute earlier, I told the clerk that I heard the film was produced as though it was a stage play. He replied, \u201cYes, but it has more energy than that, although it's a little loosey-goosey.\u201d I didn't have time to ask him what \u201cloosey-goosey\u201d meant, but I later looked it up and it means \u201crelaxed, not tense.\u201d I'm not sure that term is applicable. The stagey pretensions seem to actually make this version of Tolstoy's story stiffer and more formal rather than relaxed, especially in scenes where actors are frozen in place or where actors walk to the edge of the stage to hit their mark. I think maybe the clerk thought that loosey-goosey meant something more like looney-gooney or daffy-waffy, because this Anna Karenina is a little crazy. Tolstoy's Anna Karenina  was a serious, mature, and  intelligent woman, who may have been emotionally distraught about her situation, but she wasn't crazy even though she did commit suicide, but that was a surprise ending. The theater stage backdrop is done par excellence but it is often distracting, and the film works better in the scenes where the theater backdrop is not visible. Just when you think the director dropped the ruse, the footlights, rafters, ladders, ropes and pulleys are back. The actors are almost perfect--Keira Knightley is an exquisite Anna Karenina; Jude Law is a stern and forbidding Karenin; Alicia Vikander is an angelic Kitty; Domhnall Gleeson is a suffering, brooding, and faithful Levin; and Matthew Macfadyen is a hard-working and perfectly bourgeois aristocrat, civil servant, and family man. And then we have Count Vronsky, whose seductive powers are the pivot upon which this story has to rotate, but unfortunately, the director took some liberties that are a little shocking. When the producers of the Bond franchise decided to bet on a blonde Bond, they won. But a blonde Vronsky?  Tolstoy's Vronsky had dark hair--he was handsome, elegant, perhaps angry, pondering, and tormented. If he was a bon vivant, it was not that evident. His fickleness and his vices were not an obvious aspect of his demeanor. You had to get to know him to find out that he was an untrustworthy cad, a scoundrel, a louse, and a worm. On the surface, he was a gentleman.  Aaron Taylor-Johnson is a good actor who played John Lennon a while back, but his rendering of Vronsky is a boyish, fun-loving rake, perhaps even a mama's boy, whose carefree attitude causes damage of which he is blissfully unaware. This Vronsky should not have turned the head of the virtuous, lofty, and married Anna Karenina. Also, the movie fails to portray the depth of the grief and despair that Vronsky caused Kitty when he visibly lost interest in her after one dance with Anna Karenina, nor does it do justice to Levin's inner torment when Kitty rejects him because she believes that Vronsky is about to propose to her. On the other hand, the portrayal of Anna's neurotic behavior may go a little too far in making her out to be mentally ill. I don't think Anna's behavior was meant to portray mental illness as much as it was meant to portray the consequences of Vronsky's amoral behavior (symbolized by him riding his beloved horse too hard and then having to shoot it), the inevitable outcome of an affair based mostly on physical attraction, and the destructive power of social  ostracization. The stage-set theatricality is artistically pleasing, but it burdens the film, causing it to be drawn out in slow motion, making for a long and tedious decline of this noble and tragic literary heroine."

      "text": "It\u2019s the third time for Jon Wright to tender Keira Knightley a leading role in a period drama, the first two (PRIDE & PREJUDICE 2005, 8/10; ATONEMENT 2007, 9/10) have raked in handsome rewards, but woefully the third time is not a charm, a plain and simple reason is that Knightley\u2019s screen reputation is a far cry from Anna Karenina, Tolstoy\u2019s prime epitome of a Russian belle, a married woman with a modernism perspective, who is enchanted by her dauntless quest of passion and dare to break out of the shackles of a dead-water marriage, yet consequentially, entrapped by her capricious psyche and finally corroded by the society\u2019s scorn and her overestimated perseverance of standing her ground.\r However, the film is a high-caliber colossus of mise en sc\u00e8ne, deluxe costumes and outstanding art direction, particularly during the first act, its tableaux-on-stage suppleness can effortlessly dazzle the audience and preserve a spellbinding momentum while multifarious characters emerge and disappear, honing up to the climax, the resplendent ballroom sequences, introducing the lust-exuding pas de deux between Anna and Vronsky (Taylor-Johnson), concurrently, the subplot of Kitty (Vikander) and Levin (Gleeson) has been practically rolled out as well.\r Next, here comes the predestined adultery, which is fueled by the laborious emphasis on the enticement of the (not so inadvertent) eye contact, soon appears to be an over-contrived obligation to fornication other than following what your heart wants and the chemistry is purely physical, Anna and Vronsky should be soul-mate right? But here in this film, it is a Hollywood aggrandizement of a skinny beauty shagging a hot youngster who beams with pretended profundity (Taylor-Johnson was only 21, and not masculine enough to take on the role). So the magical momentum slumps, fortunately a little compensation is availed by Jude Law, whose version of Karenin is redolent of compassionate forbearance, elicits a free pardon to dissolve any blame generates from his side, occupies the moral higher ground, which skews our emotional pendulum and undermines Anna\u2019s character-building as an anachronistic woman who tragedy is mostly accredit to the time she is in instead of her own defect in making poor decisions.\r An involuntarily pouting Keira Knightley, treads the same water in THE DUCHESS (2008, 7/10), no wonder the aesthetic fatigue surges, so she can nail Jane Austen\u2019s Elizabeth Bennet, but not Anna Karenina, she is not that versatile as an actress. With Anna hogging the spotlight, the rest of the cast seldom has any chance to enrich their roles, Macfadyen (Knightley\u2019s Mr. Darcy in PRIDE & PREJUDICE) plays her luscious brother Oblonsky, adequately amps up some farcical digressions; as a mirrored romance between the rejected and the neglected (contrasts Anna and Vronsky\u2019s passion play), Gleeson and Vikander imbue the film with a modicum of subtlety but the wayward editing fail to make their story more engaging.\r So this adaption is a musically lyric venture for Joe Wright fans, it has its marked imperfections (thanks a lot, English is not my native tongue, otherwise I would find it is hard to take a Russian literature with mixed accents seriously), but the redundancy of his grandiose aesthetics, suggests Wright is a man knows what is his strongest suit, I can envisage him a successful comeback if only he can acquire some apposite fodder to prepare, maybe it will be his next project PAN, the origin story of Peter Pan, a wonderland backstory may fall right into his froufrou niche, meanwhile hire a new casting director is more contingent now."

      "text": "Per mettere in scena l\u2019ennesima versione del romanzo forse pi\u00f9 conosciuto di Tolstoj, Joe Wright e il suo sceneggiatore Tom Stoppard seguono una via che, pur non originalissima in s\u00e9, si dimostra assai efficace nell\u2019evitare il pericolo della banale rilettura. Tutto il film  idealmente ambientato in un piccolo teatro di provincia, in cui va in scena la rappresentazione di una societ\u00e0 ottocentesca basata sull\u2019apparenza e sull\u2019ipocrisia, tanto che solo a Levin (un bravo Domhnall Gleeson), l\u2019unico che rifiuta la parte gi\u00e0 scritta per lui dall\u2019ambiente in cui vive,  concesso di uscirne. Per farlo, utilizza la grande porta che si apre, con bella intuizione, sul fondale del teatro, mentre gli ingressi laterali consentono agli altri personaggi di accedere agli ambienti privati; la platea, invece,  di volta in volta stazione ferroviaria, sala da ballo oppure ippodromo (e i treni in viaggio sono dei modellini come quelli con cui gioca il figlio di Anna, Serhoza). Malgrado qualche sbandamento (e mugugno) tra il pubblico, il marchingegno funziona, in special modo nela prima parte in cui l\u2019unit\u00e0 di luogo  mantenuta con pi\u00f9 rigore: vi contribuiscono il ritmo regalato dal bel montaggio (Melanie Oliver) e ravvivato da un\u2019attenta cura del colore e delle musiche (dell\u2019italiano Dario Marianelli, candidato all\u2019Oscar ma battuto da Mychael Danna per \u2018Vita di Pi\u2019). Un\u2019operetta  come dice con chiarezza Vronskij  in cui spicca il vitalissimo ma amorale Oblonskij di Macfayden, infedele in amore e dispotico sul lavoro; quando esplode la passione tra Anna e Vronskij, la storia accentua invece il lato drammatico dirigendosi verso la fine che tutti ben conosciamo  almeno quanto l\u2019incipit che, per\u00f2, non viene citato  ma senza riuscire a sfuggire al minuetto sociale dominante. Anche qui prosegue il lavoro sul colore, che dai toni chiari dei primi, entusiasti amplessi si va sempre pi\u00f9 scurendo con l\u2019incupirsi della situazione: la crisi fra i due amanti culmina fra tappezzerie in blu elettrico e un\u2019incapacit\u00e0 di fissarsi dritti in volto che lascia spazio solo a sguardi lanciati attraverso gli specchi. Una considerazione sulla coppia protagonista, quest\u2019ultima, che ci porta alle dolenti note. Se appare inevitabile, e non particolarmente fastidioso, che molti aspetti del romanzo vengano semplificati  capita quando si cerca di infilare un librone in poco pi\u00f9 di centoventi minuti di film  ci\u00f2 che davvero funziona assai poco  la chimica fra i due personaggi principali, che proprio non riesce a scattare: un passaggio a vuoto che danneggia una tematica importante come quella della passione nonostante le regole e la cui responsabilit\u00e0  ricade su di un\u2019interpretazione che delude per pi\u00f9 di un motivo: Nella sua divisa bianca, Aaron Taylor-Johnson  un Vronskij pi\u00f9 che altro decorativo in cui non si sa se siano pi\u00f9 incongrui i capelli biondi o i baffetti posticci mentre Keira Knightley tende, come altre volte, ad andare sopra le righe in un ruolo gi\u00e0 di suo abbastanza sovraccarico quando basterebbe lavorare sulla sua bellezza irregolare (dev\u2019essere l\u2019unica attrice di primo piano senza il sorriso ortodontico standard). Per fortuna che, accanto a loro, il resto del cast funzioni senza sbavature a partire dalla brillante prova di Jude Law che, dietro a barba e stempiatura, regala una bella intensit\u00e0 all\u2019amarezza e ai dubbi di Karenin."

This time around, however, I just couldn't get on board with whatever was attempted. The whole \"theatre/stage\" motif was impressive from a purely logistical standpoint. Beyond that, though, it was confusing as all get-out.

If ever there was a case-book example of how to completely miss the boat in making a film out of novel, this would be it.  It is regrettable that so much effort in overly lavish scenery and costumes was made around such an eccentric, off-key, virtually incomprehensible version of Tolstoy's marvelous novel."

I don't know how much Joe Wright gave justice to Leo Tolstoy's epic novel .\rI enjoyed the movie up to some extent keeping in mind that it has mixed reviews irrespective of the fact that I'm haven't read the novel itself.\rThe dollhouse version of screenplay was enjoyable , Tolstoy's was very lengthy and in parts so it was tough to get the right emotions in just 2 hours .\rJude Law as Count Alexei Alexandrovich Karenin was some extraordinary character a true inspiration a true man ."

      "text": "Anna Karenina is a great story, and this is an adaptation that gets better each time you see it. At first, it can be a bit confusing, because it is like a musical piece that one has to hear more than once to get the feel of; but a good amount of feeling does go into the film. Kiera Knightly plays a very sympathetic Anna: natural, and not exactly naive, but at the same time does not really know what she is doing as she is pulled about by her \"demon\". The film looks great and the stage-play motif is brought off magnificently with vital creative spirit. The main downside of the film is that Count Vronsky does not come off as someone worth ruining oneself over (though perhaps others will think different). On the other hand, the scenes between Anna and her husband (played by Jude Law) have very good dramatic tension and draw the film through each act. All-in-all, Anna Karenina is a good film with rewatch value. This is a commercial production, but a very creative and interesting one. My rating is a touch on the high side (relative to what one should expect), but it suits some of my tastes, and I personally enjoyed this film quite a bit."

      "text": "The film\u2019s intentionally theatrical nature describes the publicly view-able nature of the Russian aristocracy, plainly illustrating the social implications of Anna\u2019s affair. And like Tolstoy\u2019s masterpiece, it gracefully shifts between the many scenes in the complex narrative. But the stylized production does not detract from the precise yet emotional performances by Keira Knightley, Jude Law, Matthew Macfadyen and others."

      "text": "Sometimes it shows quality but it didn't convince me.\"Anna Karenina\" is one of the classics of Russian literature. Written by Tolstoi, it is a truly colossal book, with long descriptions and that details the mood of the characters. It is a very rich and complex book, with intense dialogues and moments when the characters debate the state of the empire, moments where the author, apart from the story he wrote, inserted a hint of social and political criticism. Thus, it is a difficult book to transpose to the cinema. Something is always lost. It's not even worth comparing because we already know that.In this film, the forbidden and sweeping romance of Anna, a woman trapped in a routine and conventional marriage, and Vronsky, the military officer who wants to live life as if each day were the last, has been fully transposed onto a stage, as if all life and the entire Russian court society were a gigantic theater stage where everyone plays a role. The metaphor is not irrelevant. In this film, the importance of the social role of each person stands out. For people like Anna or her husband, the opinion of others counts and affects the way they play their role on the stage of Russian society. Ana, Vronsky, Minister Alexei, each of them is just as or more concerned with the social implications of what is happening than with the events themselves.Despite this, and although the film respects the essentials of the original book, it is quite weak. Joe Wright looks like a weak director, who takes a sugary romance, sweetens it even more and puts the audience to sleep by telling it ... very ... slowly ... and without any noticeable emotion. To make matters worse, he was so excited to make a stylish movie, with those theatrical artifices, visual effects and camera angles thought out of the box that he neglected everything else. The film is very slow without any reason, the story has no depth and is told almost in a gossipy tone and certain scenes are so stylized that part of their meaning is lost. For example, the ball scene at the Scherbatsky house, where we don't see Anna excited about the success she makes in her social debut in Moscow, and where Kitty's anger is justified by Vronsky's attitudes without taking into account the fact that the young woman , on her social debut, she was being virtually overshadowed by another woman, older, more experienced and already married!It remains for me to speak of the actors. If on the one hand I really liked the performance of Jude Law, who gave us a very dignified, impassive and serious Minister Alexei, and the work of Matthew Macfadyen (who played Anna's brother, Stiva) and Domhnall Gleeson, who gave life to a rude but rich and important Kostia Levin. Aaron Taylor-Johnson never convinced me how Vronsky and Keira Knightley just don't have any chemistry with him.Technically, the film is quite interesting. The special effects, visual and sound are very good, the green screen and CGI were used and abused, there are some moments of greater tension, but are accidentally attenuated by the soundtrack, which has quality but is sometimes too much loud and shrill. A word yet, for the excellent quality of the costumes and sets of this film."
