This movie is over the top in many ways, including the particulars of this underworld. The action is plentiful with lots of hard knock hand-to-hand and gun battles. Fortunately, director Navot Papushado manages to create original ways to dispense brutality, often with a comic book approach that renders it less violent and more cool.

I'm gonna watch this at least two more times ! this movie is gonna make The 355 look bad when it comes out later on in the year, not to put them in competition but this was miles better than Black Widow."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Gunpowder Milkshake premiered on Netflix this weekend with an intriguing title and a top-notch cast. The high octane, action flick directed by Navot Papushado is full of style but low on originality as it borrows from John Wick and Kill Bill schools of assassin cinema. Here\u2019s the story: Sam (Karen Gillan) was abandoned by her mother, Scarlet (Lena Headey), when she was only 12 years old. Scarlet was an assassin, who had to leave her daughter after a job went wrong. Sam was left to be raised by the crime syndicate, The Firm, who expect to to carry out their bidding with precision and ruthlessness. On a fateful job, Sam kills a man, who got caught up in a situation because he\u2019s trying to protect his 8 year old daughter, Emily (Chloe Coleman). Sam takes it upon her to protect Emily and dismantle The Firm as they turn on her with the help of the Librarian (Michelle Yeoh, Angela Bassett, and Carla Gugino). Girl power, butt kicking and lots of shooting ensue.As these action thrillers go, the viewer wants to be grabbed and never let go of until the final shots. Unfortunately, Gunpowder Milkshake does not do that. Sure, there are early action sequences that are entertaining like a funny fight between Sam and some henchmen in a bowling alley, but there is a lot of exposition and these early fights get repetitive. Unlike a lot of movies these days, I must commend Papushado, who co-wrote this film, on writing an original story as so many are based on other IP. Sequels and franchises abound. Papushado, however, seems to have culled together this story from a mish-mosh of other assassin plots and stuck an ensemble of women in the main roles. Even though it\u2019s an original story, it lacks originality in the plot and the derivative nature of the story is not so great. On the other hand, it really doesn\u2019t matter the ins-and-outs of the story because we\u2019re really just here for the fighting and action.In the plus column for Gunpowder Milkshake, the ensemble of women here is a big draw. Game of Thrones fans want to see Lena Headey as an action star. She\u2019s fierce and smart. She even gets some good one liners, here and there. As a mother-daughter story, the movie tries to put some emotional stakes to the story between Sam and Scarlet. It works somewhat. The other standouts are the trio of Angela Bassett, Carla Gugino and Michelle Yeoh. Whenever these three are on screen, you know it is going to be fire. The energy infused in the film comes from these women taking the reins and never letting go. In fact, their all-too-brief scene in the first hour probably hurts the film because you\u2019re just waiting for them to come back. Bassett, Gugino and Yeoh almost save the movie in the second hour.I\u2019ll also give a quick shout out to the costume design. There is a lot of color used throughout the film. Neon is a striking motif that the filmmakers have used. The color and costumes add to the energy and visual depth of the film. Lastly, some of the action scenes, especially in the second half, are quite cool when it goes beyond the same-old-same-old shoot outs. The characters get to be clever and athletic, which is always entertaining.I suspect there will be a sequel and, hopefully, the filmmakers will realize that the gold for the Gunpowder Milkshake franchise is in Lena Headey, Angela Bassett, Michelle Yeoh and Carla Gugino. Take note, Papushado.Ultimately, Gunpowder Milkshake is a fine action thriller with an unoriginal assassin plot but with a great supporting cast. There is a lot of style here and, if you like shoot-outs, then you will have your fill of those as well. For me, this is a good stream on a Saturday night with a bowl of popcorn, if you can get through the slow and repetitive first hour. For those looking for a John Wick and Kill Bill mash-up, grab your big box of popcorn and enjoy."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "There are some great shots here, but some serious misfires on the music during fight scenes, they don\u2019t compliment each other well.

The action sequence was a mixture of John Wick and Jackie Chan. Director Navot Papushado and Cinematographer Michael Seresin transform a generic script into a blast. There was a smart use of a camera and lightning. The music, color grading, costumes, makeup, production design, and the whole atmosphere was brilliant.I loved the library scenario and the classic literature language used for the guns.

But the movie deals more with girl power and the mean gangstars are portrayed as idiots. Secondly, coming to the climax, it happens in a coffee shop where the russians and the other women will meet. It is a holy place for Russians and other gangstars so all of them are not allowed to use their weapons inside the shop. While using this weakpoint againist the russians, the women uses the guns inside and kills all of them. It is like killing them off guard, what kind of fun it is when you shoot from back? It is like admitting you dont have guts to face the other person from face. Thats is not good, fighting equally is agreeable but not shooting when off guard.The actress did a very good job in acting and all action sequences.

Er \u00fcbernimmt die geschichtlichen Elemente von John Wick die gut sind und versaut diese. Sams Charakter \u00e4hnelt sehr stark dem von John Wick bzw versucht es. Sie wirkt total lustlos und emotionslos. Sie hat immer den gleichen Gesichtsausdruck. Die Chemie zwischen Ihrer Mutter und Emily passt null. Emily ist mir auch egal und ihre Gags sind cringe. Generell ist der Humor sehr cringe und unangenehm. Die Charakterentwicklungen gehen viel zu schnell (wenn man das Charakterentwicklungen nennen kann). Die Action ist auch langweilig der Endkampf geht viel zu schnell und ist lahm. Die einzigen Szenen die ok waren ist wo Sam kurz gel\u00e4hmt ist. Die Charaktere sind mir alle egal und austauschbar. Es wird in einigen Gags auch auf das Thema Fenimisus eingebaut und das in schlecht. Es gibt soger ein paar Aussagen die Frauen schlecht darstellen und es wird nicht darauf reagiert. Die Effekte sind auch schlecht, das Blut sind null realistisch aus eher wie Saft.Logik ist hier auch nicht vorhanden. Ein Eis das drei Stunden steht sieht einfach aus wie als, ob es frisch ist. Ein paar Tode sind auch unlogisch und zu \u00fcbertrieben dargestellt.
