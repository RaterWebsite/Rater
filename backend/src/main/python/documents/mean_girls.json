      "text": "Previously home schooled in Africa Cady Heron (Lohan) has recently moved to a small town near Chicago and immediately runs afoul of the notorious Regina George. Along with her two friends she soon devises a plan to get her own back.Being a thirty year old male I guess I am not exactly the target audience for this film but seeing as it was written by Tina Fey, creator of the excellent 30 Rock, I was hoping for a few more out and out laughs and the movie can also border on being slightly too \u2018Disney\u2019 in the way everyone learns their lesson in the end. Despite this Mean Girls makes for an enjoyable watch as it is clear that this is a subject matter that is close to the heart of Fey. Her immense writing talent is demonstrated in the way she injects heart into the script making the audience sympathize for characters that could easily come across as unlikable. The performances from the cast also help to move the film along at a good pace. Lohan is particularly good and with all her recent problems it is easy to forget what a talented actress she is."

      "text": "I haven't seen this movie when it came out because it's clearly a girls' movie and didn't seem funny to me. A few days ago I read that the movie became a cult movie, but wasn't successful in the beginning due to a lack of marketing. So I thought: I might have been wrong; Let's watch.I read that Lindsay practically carried the movie. Well, I don't know about that. She definitely was a special kind of a cutie, but otherwise her acting was not structurally better than that of others.Now on to the funny part. Well... oof. If you like run-off-the-mill jokes then you're set, but otherwise the \"funny' entirely depended on the wacky stick figures.Was there a plot? Yes. Two plots; Lindsay trying to get a boyfriend which was being sabotaged and secondly the preparation of the revenge by a ugly or alternative girl (or something) who was wronged by the three beauties. Lindsay is stuck in the middle of all of this. The plot elements jump from branch to branch like a blind monkey stung by a bee (maybe a queen bee). But we can't have anything intelligent can we? Just like the girls, the plot evolves in random directions from second to second.An odd thing sticks out: many actors looked like they were imported straight out of Jewish communities; All of the relevant roles are occupied by Ashkenazi's and Khazarians. I was tempted to check whether this was co-produced with Israel.The perpetuation of culture is blatant, something the very industry and their media buddies attack whites for. \"Smart\" Asians, \"Girls with feelings\" (fat girls), outsiders (uglies), nerds, the stereotyping never ends.The shallowness of the movie - bunch of girls acting out like 12 year old spoiled brats - should have been its appeal and I had some expectations, but the execution wasn't done well at all, other than the technicalities such as the camerawork and editing.Don't fall for the user score (unusually much higher than paid off professional reviewers). Having read a bunch of perfect 10 reviews, it's clear to me that bots and \"affiliate\" reviews are at play here. This is 100% exclusively a chick flick, and for most of them it may be a tad too dumb."

I was expecting it to be stupid, but it was actually cleverly funny and relateable to a lot of people who ever went to High School or are in High School. Females that is. Lindsay Lohan plays your typical goodie goodie and The Hot Chick's Rachel McAdams plays the popular girl at school who Lohan's character befriends only to get revenge upon. Former and current SNL members have cameos in this including Tim Meadows as the school principle, Amy Poehler as McAdams \"trying to be hip\" mom with a horrible boob job, Ana Gasteyer as Lohan's estranged mother and Tina Fey (the writer of the film) as the geeky but still kind of cool math teacher. I'd recommend Mean Girls to anybody looking for a good laugh who likes revenge films."

The writing is sharp and witty and the performances delivered by both Lohan and McAdams are so cut-throat, raw and dark that you really see who they're characters are. I was surprised by how well the story was created and the cast react to each other extremely well."

      "text": "Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan) grew up in Africa and is home-schooled, well, until now. Her parents move to America and decide that it's time for Cady to start high school. Then Cady is left to struggle with the non-written laws of the human world. The film is basically a chick-flick, with a high school theme.Cady makes friends with the Plastics, who are the royalty of their school. They're these three beautiful girls, one of them stupid, one of them the servant bee, and one of them the queen bee. Queen bee, Regina George (Rachel McAdams), is both smart and evil, and the most glamorous of them all. First, Cady makes friends with them but after she sees Regina steal her crush from her, she plots a plan against the Plastics with two outsiders, Janis and Damian.I had never watched a Lindsay Lohan movie before, and I'm surprised that she can actually act. She looked right for the role, and wow, she was looking decent before all those drugs and partying. She could've progressed into a good actress. Rachel McAdams makes a good smug, plotting, evil **** We're bored of seeing her in romantic dramas one after another, she must try different roles. Amanda Seyfried looked like she was having fun playing the stupid blonde, and that makes the viewers have fun too. And the girl who plays the outsider Janis, Lizzy Caplan, she's the chick from Cloverfield, in case \"Who was that girl?\" got stuck in your head.Well, it's not a deep, meaningful movie. You can watch it just to have fun, or to spend 1,5 hours not thinking deeply. It's a high school comedy with girls plotting against each other, but it's not that bad. The cast is good. There is even Tina Fey. And the Janitor from Scrubs. It's watchable."

Allow me to explain, Cady Heron has been home schooled her entire life, now she has moved to America and is put into an actual school. Completely out of her depth she seeks for friends where she can find them and ends up becoming a 'plastic', one of the best looking, and most highly feared women in school. However as she begins to truly become a plastic to impress a guy she soon realises how wrong she was.\rMean Girls on pen and paper sounds like every other chick flick but its much more than that, for anyone who went to school in the 21st century, its like being back in school. Every social class is portrayed wonderfully by a fantastic cast, not to mention that it is actually funny for both men and women. Mean Girls is one of the gems hidden in an overcrowded, poorly done genre and worth a try for anyone looking for a funny, feel good film."

The jokes pretty much unanimously work very well and the one liners are great. Lots of quotable lines, as has been obvious since this film's release. Rachel McAdams, Lacey Chabert, and Amanda Seyfried, are all really good, especially McAdams. Lindsay Lohan is also great and this should have been a star-making turn for her and watching this makes me sad thinking of all the lost potential for her. The film is certainly very chick flicky, but is a good one at that and is still enjoyable to me as a guy. Plus, even though is focuses on the problems facing girls in high school, a lot of the things they discuss about high school rings true all the same. Overall, this one is an easy one to watch and even easier to enjoy. Obviously not an Oscar-worthy film, but a quality flick all the same."
