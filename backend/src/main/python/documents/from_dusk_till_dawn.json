I loved it."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This movie has cult status for some and I see why. It is famous for having Quentin Tarantino as actor, George Clooney playing not a good / heroic character and the Salma Hayek scene that even Rammstein covered in one of their music videos. There is also a dividing twist in the movie that is hated by some and praised by others and sadly I cant give you an advise here because of spoilers. I can however say it is one of the movies you either love or hate. For me this twist made the movie more unique and appealing as I have not seen something like this before (Even M. Night Shyamalan cant compete here). Story: The criminal brothers Richard and Seth Gecko are on the run from the police to Mexico after they broke out of prison and robbed a bank while the media enjoys this for the audience ratings (Outlaw heroes). They run into the former priest Jacob, his daughter and adopted son in a motel. So starts the adventure unlike anyone before. The story is fully entertaining and will become something you will never expect. I truly enjoyed it but I repeat my warning that the twist is what many say ruined the movie for them. For me it makes the movie memorable and discuss-worthy. I think this does not even change if you hate the movie. As a sidenote while Robert Rodriguez is the director the script was done by Quentin Tarantino so you can count it as Tarantino film too. Lastly I want to praise the dark humor of the movie here. Actors: We got a good cast here. Lets begin with George Clooney as Seth Gecko. I think he enjoys the chance to be not typecast as the hero / good character. He delivers his role excellent. Then we have Quentin Tarantino as Richard Gecko. He is now on the other side of the camera and it answers the question if a great director is also a good actor with a no. But I must admit he is quite entertaining and so I will give him a free pass. Harvey Keitel plays Jacob Fuller and is probably the best actor in the movie in a sneaking way. Unforgettable is Selma Hayeks performance as Santanico Pandemonium (That is not a typo). Like I said there are countless homages and parodies for the scene including the Rammstein one. Lastly I want to praise Ernest Liu as Scott Fuller, Juliette Lewis as Kate Fuller and of cause Danny Trejo as Razor Charlie. In total we have a good performance and all characters work as well as intended. Presentation: It has the style you expect from a mixture from Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez. Everything looks convincing and enhances the atmosphere. The soundtrack is excellent and has tracks from The Mavericks, Tito & Tarantula and ZZ Top to name a few. I will say again it enhances the atmosphere. Overall this is a dividing movie which I already put in the love or hate category. For me it works well and is entertaining. I recommend it alone for its strength, humor and being able to discuss it with friends but warn you that it is not for everyone. You can find it silly or hate it with passion too and to be fair I see the point and its validity."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "The famous line, \"No thanks, I've already had a wife\", was improvised by George Clooney.

Every audience member has a different set of criteria they use to measure their viewing experience. Not everyone shares the same set of criteria. If we did, what a bland and uninspired world this would be.\r What I Personally Liked About \"From Dusk Till Dawn\":\rI want to preface this by saying that I have never been that big a fan of television. So this was my introduction to George Clooney and even in an off-the-wall gorefest such as this, it was easy to see he would go on to have a prosperous career in cinema. His presence dominates the screen and his sense of character never falters for one second. We are also treated to Quentin Tarantino's little b*tch boy sidekick of a brother. Tarantino almost always adds some worthwhile humor to his screen roles and this is perhaps the best of his bunch. Salma Hayek is another big highlight of the movie, even though she doesn't have nearly the same amount of screen time. Let's face it, sure she has had better roles in her career which challenged her abilities and allowed her to shine. However, any time you get to see a hot Latin beauty with a six-foot python wrapped around her half naked body it's going to leave an impression. In addition, I wish we could have had more Tom Savini. Seriously. This guy should have stepped in front of the camera more often as it's clear he thoroughly enjoys hamming it up. The music also plays an important part in this production. From the Blasters to Tito and Tarantula to ZZ Top, this is not the average music which accompanies your normal vampire film. These southern-tinged rock 'n' blues pieces go a long way in differentiating this movie from the plethora of vampire motion pictures which seem to populate each and every decade since the creation of the medium.\r What I Personally Disliked About \"From Dusk Till Dawn\":\rEasily the worst part of this movie is Ernest Liu. He is simply not a strong enough actor to bring anything to the table. He's surrounded by larger than life, recognizable actors and his bland performance stands out like a bonfire on a blackened evening. Maybe if Juliette Lewis wasn't playing the role of his sister there would have been a bit more balance to his monotone execution. As it is, he is woefully out of place and I just can't seem to get past his presence in this picture. There are also some fairly heavy pacing problems, particularly before the stylistic switch between hostage drama and horror show.\r My Overall Impression of \"From Dusk Till Dawn\":\rThis is a fun little vampire grindhouse action/horror/comedy but, at the end of the day, it's still just a vampire grindhouse action/horror/comedy. It's bloody. It's campy. It's filled with naked t*ts, flying fists and some really good make-up effects. It's not Shakespeare, but we don't go into this kind of flick expecting it to be so. While it tries its hardest to be original, it's still susceptible to a handful of genre cliches that affect the enjoyment of the presentation.

But this time I am to blame even Tarantino for it. For the structure of the script is incredibly promising and has enormous potential.The script is bafflingly smart. It starts with a crime scene that marks the territory and as it proceeds further and further, the madness multiplies and the boundaries are pushed periodically. Now, this is an engaging journey to go through. Jumping in one from one location to another, one genre to another and one tone of violence to another, but this is all shucked out of the window by the execution. What all Rodriguez had to do was acknowledge the current state, position, scenario that is explored in this wild ride.As soon as he accepts the presence of each character the film should electrify all those elements that were meant to shock the viewers. And it is not that he hasn't tried. With a hands-on camera work that gives a personal look from a character's perspective, he has made us look through their spects plenty of times. But From Dusk Till Dawn, none of the characters notify us physically or verbally of their inner emotions of the world they revolve around."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "From Dusk Till Dawn is one hell of a rollercoaster. Written by the legendary Quentin Tarantino and directed by the almost as legendary Robert Rodriguez, it is a film that shouldn\u2019t be missed if you\u2019re a fan of either of them. Great acting from George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino with special appearances by the great Tom Savini and Salma Hayek. Savini also does the effects, which really shines in this film. There are a few moments where it gets a little too ridiculous and corny, but it\u2019s fun all the same."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "From Dusk till Dawn is a cult movie of some kind. It is unique at least in that Quentin Tarantino plays one of the main roles. And of course, the contrast of the first half from the second is very different. A great cast, a second-half trash of the film and a fun ending. The viewer's film will definitely not leave indifferent"}], "recommendations": ["wrong_turn", "malignant", "vacancy", "desperado", "the_last_witch_hunter", "copshop", "the_cabin_in_the_woods", "the_conjuring_the_devil_made_me_do_it", "pride_and_prejudice_and_zombies", "the_invasion", "scream_4", "hancock", "the_babysitter", "polar", "mindhunters", "the_wolf_of_snow_hollow", "american_ultra", "i_am_legend", "scream_3", "hercules", "the_wolfman", "final_destination", "reservoir_dogs", "ready_or_not", "underworld_evolution"]}
