Although director Paul Feig proves adept at handling the parodic side of things, in the latter stages, he seems to be trying to ensure the film can exist (relatively) un-ironically within the suburban noir genre, the very genre it's attempting to lampoon. Despite this schizophrenic quality, however, it's an undeniably film.Adapted by Jessica Sharzer from Darcey Bell's 2017 novel, A Simple Favour tells the story of Stephanie Smothers (Anna Kendrick), a widowed single-mum who runs a life hacks vlog with minimal viewership. Enter Emily Nelson (Blake Lively), a public relations executive for a major fashion label. Soon after meeting, the two bond, with Stephanie in awe of Emily, who seems to have it all; a good-looking novelist/lecturer husband, Sean (Henry Golding), a gorgeous house, a successful career, a great kid, and an acerbic attitude that Stephanie would kill for. Several weeks later, with Emily held up at work, she asks Stephanie to pick up her son, and she'll collect him later. Except she doesn't collect him. As a few days go by, Stephanie and Sean report her missing. However, unsatisfied with the direction the investigation is taking, Stephanie is soon amateur sleuthing her way across the country.A Simple Favour is at its best when working as a parody of \"mommy murder mysteries\", gently (and often not so gently) exposing some of its more unrealistic tropes to ridicule. For example, the three main characters are all generic templates to the point of clich\u00e9; the ing\u00e9nue who feels honour-bound to do everything she can to find the truth; the sardonic and caustic plot catalyst, who always seems to have an ace up her sleeve; and, the brilliant but frustrated spouse who may, or may not, be in on the crime. However, their archetypal characteristics are dialled up to such a degree that they can't help but seem caricatures.Opening with a late Saul Bass-esque title sequence, scored to Jean Paul Keller's \"Ca s'est arrange\" (1967), the film signals its playful tone right from the off. The emphasis on stylisation is perhaps seen most clearly upon Emily's introduction. As Stephanie shelters from the rain, Emily emerges from a car in slow motion, with the camera starting on her feet before slowly moving up to her head as she raises an umbrella. Cutting to a mid-shot, she then begins to walk across the carpark (still in slow motion), as a broken umbrella blows past her, replacing the tumbleweed of a classic western shootout. Apart from being a memorable introduction to the character, the visual design of the scene is predicated on cine-literacy, showing that the filmmakers are more than aware of standard genre tropes, and, more importantly, how to employ them for comedic effect.Indeed, the entire film revels in its own intertextual awareness, with later references to such defining noirs as Gaslight (1944), Spellbound (1945), and Les diaboliques (1955). Large portions of the film feature narration within narration, a technique so beloved of classic noir mysteries.If there was one element of that didn't work, however, it was the mystery plot. I get that it's all a satire of the multi-twist-for-twist's-sake suburban murder mystery, with the preposterousness of such plots played for maximum farcicality. However, Feig is unable to bridge the tone of the frothier comic moments and the darker ones which become increasingly prevalent towards the end. For example, the film features a scene in which someone who has just been ploughed by a car and is trying to crawl away is nonchalantly told if they don't stop, they're going to hurt their knees. That's pretty dark, but it's also pretty funny. However, it comes only moments after a scene in which a drug-addict is held under the water and drowned. Not a huge amount to laugh at there.For all that, however, I found A Simple Favour most enjoyable. The purely-satirical early scenes earn enough goodwill so that the more plot-heavy later scenes don't completely tear the whole thing down. The film as a whole shines a not unwelcome light on the increasingly self-important suburban noir, and for the most part, the parody is very well judged. When the comedy is forced to retreat in the service of more serious material, the tonal balance is definitely knocked off, but despite this, A Simple Favour remains very entertaining. It won't change your life, but it's a rewarding couple of hours."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Fun movie! Stylishly done; amusing; gorgeous to look at with great-looking clothes, houses and humans; and with more tart twists than a barful of perfectly chilled Martinis, \"A Simple Favor\" is a very entertaining popcorn thriller. Good soundtrack, too. One tiny critique:  For me, towards the end, some of the twists came so quickly that my feeble little brain was spinning. I wished they had spent a little more time on them... Cuz I was a little like \"Wait, what?!?\"  The switcheroos were zooming by like Vroom--Vroom--Vroom! And OK, I will admit: I got home and Googled the synopsis to make sure I hadn't missed anything.  Vanity Fair had an article called \"About that ending...,\" so I don't feel too bad about feeling a little fuzzy-headed. Perhaps the book was a little more elucidating, I dunno. But I loved it!"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Tonal inconsistencies and glaring \"Gone Girl\" parallels aside, I had a good amount of fun with \"A Simple Favor,\" a comedic thriller from frequent Melissa McCarthy collaborator Paul Feig. Was this the correct project for him to direct? I'm still not so sure, as there are -- as previously mentioned -- a number of elements here that just simply don't work together for me. This is much more of a thriller than a comedy, as the comedic stylings seem almost randomly placed into certain scenes to offset a lot of the dramatic intrigue. And it just doesn't gel together. This should have been a straight-laced thriller. But, even if that were the case, you'd end up running into a bigger version of the other problem with this movie -- this is supremely similar to \"Gone Girl.\" There's even a scene in here that's borderline lifted from that film. Again, this isn't perfect, but it is fun, featuring terrific chemistry between Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively, and a real neat final act."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "This film is a politically correct quagmire of a movie. The story itself is trite and predictable and the movie had a ton of plot holes. Plus, you can tell the producers or the multicultural team wanted to blatantly throw in all kinds of people just to save face. You have the main actor as a yellow dude, who is married to a Caucasian woman, yet their kid (this annoying yellow kid) looks nothing like the Caucasian woman at all which makes no sense. Then on top of that you have the yellow dude bed both Caucasian woman which seems to me like they want to push interracial dating on the masses. The funniest part of the PC agenda in this film are the random brown people thrown in who serve no purpose to the story. There's one woman and her kid who is just sort of there, and the few lines she does say make her sound unsure of herself (but not in a funny way, more of an \"I can't act and I was only put her to represent brown people\" sort of way.) And then there's another random brown girl thrown in who works at the front desk of a company. Again, she doesn't really act, she's just sort of there.    And then of course you have a token gay guy thrown in and a bunch of black actors and the author and screenwriter are both female.   Yeah, if you're not a fan of PC stuff I would say to avoid this movie like the plague as it's not a good movie to begin with. You can't trust critics on sites like Rotten Tomatoes as they're usually liberal types who like this sort of thing or they've been given bonuses to rate certain films favorably."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Now I have to give props to Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick, who did spectacular jobs in this film. They both could easily play off of one another like yin and yang. Both actresses gave it their all in these roles and you can easily see that. Anna probably had the most captivating one of them all . You see her struggle to try and find her friend and at the same time be a good mom to her kid, and she just did a great job of portraying that struggle . Another thing that this movie did great  were  the costumes. I don\u2019t usually talk about the clothes but they had to be mentioned for this film. All of the outfits were marvelous and deserve a nomination for the costumes. They also were like characters on their own. They also helped in showing character arcs and growth,  mainly for  Anna Kendricks clothes. I also really liked the musical scores. It helped you understand the tension in some scenes. Now some thing that could be fixed is how the  film felt like two different movies to me, and not in a good way. The first half of the film just felt really slow to me, which is understandable due to it introducing the characters, but the other half was way more interesting. The second half was more intense and had me on the edge of my seat. There is a plot twist that is very obvious about what it was going to be. In the end, \u201cA Simple Favour\u201d was a surprisingly enjoyable film \u2014 one that I think a lot of people would like."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "A Simple Favor has funny punches which the acting partners deliver well. The cinematography is fine. In \"Style and Medium in the Motion Pictures\" Erwin Panofsky poses, \"\u2026that the screenplay, in contrast to the theater play, has no aesthetic existence independent of its performance, and that its characters have no aesthetic existence outside the actors,\" which I think is an interesting and valid point that I will make sure to more consciously consider with every viewing of a film.\u00a0Do I completely ignore the female body throughout the film? No, I'm not going to. There are a lot of pretty, beautiful, and gorgeous women in the world, for a variety of their reasons. Yet, attraction needs assistance. I'm a single male. The song \"Man in Me\" by The Persuasions comes to mind whenever I think of Blake Lively playing her role in the film, not because she is doing that for me, but because it'll be amazing to attribute that song to a woman that does (in accompaniment with \"Do It Again\" by The Staple Singers) affect me in such a way (not in the conniving-illegal-murderous sense).\u00a0A Simple Favor touches on very sensitive topics such as alcoholism, drug abuse, depression, debt, fraud, incest, illegitimate children, and childhood in a touch-and-go comical-drama-full whirlwind. The story is decent though seems to scatter about in a way that still makes sense (because it's like a walk through of a to be mystery with surprises as no surprises bent on surprises\u2026yeah). A Simple Favor is an awkward film that really has a way of crushing vices.I think the film uses hysteria to flirt with its audience members. The film gets messy (which makes sense in accordance with context), and I think another title may be more suitable.

The start off the movie had potential for an twisted rendezvous between two women with odd backgrounds, but ends in an obvious and dull ending.

Sure, it\u2019s got Anna Kendrick, whom many say is a role model because of her outer beauty. But you know what? Neither of those things matter, because they\u2019re relied on to hold up a film high in fructose. The sugar of A Simple Favor may taste sweet, except the rush of its evil intentions churns regret once your health turns detrimental after swallowing its poorly put together eye candy.\u200bAt least the candy does look sweet in its display case; the makeup crew demonstrate tremendous effort to bring out Anna Kendrick\u2019s beauty with or without mascara. The costume designer Renee Ehrlich Kalfus (The Cider House Rules, Hidden Figures) also complements the Pitch Perfect star well while keeping it supportive toward the narrative. Kalfus dresses Anna in a big yellow jacket to divert our attention from any covered-up intentions, just one of the many popping colors that complement the film\u2019s desired retro style. The look remains consistent right from the opening credits that flash against zesty Spanish music, carrying on these sharp colors to contrast two sides of our ideal 2018 American woman.On one end, there are Anna Kendrick\u2019s cutesy Pinterest mom DIY projects. On the other, there is Blake Lively\u2019s aesthetics of a woman paid more than a man. Now as for the costar\u2019s character, Blake first appears with high heels pounding on wet cement, a growing image of sophistication that still can\u2019t match the size of her secretive closet. Between these two, they supposedly become close friends after knowing each other for just a couple of days, as represented by a friendship bracelet Anna makes for Blake. No, it doesn\u2019t matter if Blake has a painting of her \u201cpet beaver\u201d in the living room, there\u2019s just something about these two that meshes well.There\u2019s where the problem with this film starts.The two leads\u2019 \u201cclose\u201d friendship of what looks like two days is never believable, mainly because of the awful writing void of any believable grief that gives neither actress any depth to work off. Blake Lively\u2019s character is merely overpowered, but even if this had the best writer in the world, it wouldn\u2019t help much. Blake just puts on her own show without any chemistry with anyone in the cast. Odds are, she decided to play a mother who chugs alcohol around little kids by merely acting as if drunk on a typical Saturday night.In fact, there was probably some alcohol hopping all over the sets during the production, as it appears these producers like to annihilate a child\u2019s innocence by making one little boy drop an F-bomb hard. That\u2019s fine if it serves story purpose, except it doesn\u2019t, it just comes off forced and lazy, and nobody seemed to bother giving the child actor any context of what he was screaming.There literally is no other attention to story anywhere else, as one missed opportunity for clever symbolism sticks out: after one police officer mentions following metaphorical bread crumbs to solve a case, the very next scene features Caesar salad with bread crumbs in it. It tries to connect to a Hansel & Gretel scenario where Anna feels like the two children inside Blake the witch\u2019s mega-expensive gingerbread house of a home, unfortunately that piece of symbolism has no payoff. In addition, many unnecessary flashbacks get explained again the same way immediately after thrown into the final edit. As if the storytelling isn\u2019t lazy enough, Anna claims to be a \u201cstruggling\u201d single mom\u2014yet can purchase expensive technology for her mommy vlog\u2026 and the occasional spy equipment. Can\u2019t make this stuff up, folks!In most every role Anna plays nowadays, she\u2019s either a clueless love interest (like in The Accountant) or \u201cSlutty McSlut-slut,\u201d (like in Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates) but here, Anna combines the cluelessness with the sex-object in a way that thinks it\u2019s so classy. Part of the problem is that most of the project\u2019s other creative minds have comedic backgrounds, resulting in a collaborated direction that moves too quick, and Anna, unfortunately, being the leading role, gets the last laugh. If these producers wanted to cast her purely for the marketing, they didn\u2019t even do that right! Case in point: the little black dress Anna wears in the poster is never shown in the movie itself\u2014just a longer version of it. Hey, got to show those legs to lure in those box office numbers!There truly is evil lurking everywhere in this wannabee thriller with an ultimate intent on not suspense, but advertising whatever the celebs are wearing.

The chemistry is off the hook, it is almost like a dream team waiting to be allotted in a project, Kendrick and Lively are electrifying whenever they are on screen, they are funny and equally scary. This deeply sinister genre fuels on nothing but perspective, with a twisted mind set, it not only sets all the chess pieces accordingly, but draws in the most unexpected cards under its sleeves with justification and of course slick panache that makes you nod, in its self-created web of lies, on beat. Somehow, the combination of music and references to all the recipes goes well, Kendrick has the range to act like a typical overprotecting mom and obviously to rap with a mic-drop attitude that she has been carrying since Pitch Perfect. If actually taken into consideration, she sticks by on each frame of the feature and pulls it off all on her shoulder without even flinching for a split second. She learns fast, she takes time, she argues on petty thing and she cracks lame jokes, Kendrick is in her A game and this time she has got this three dimensional character that she is drunk on. On the other hand, Lively feels shadowed in Kendrick's footsteps, no matter how much power her character must possess, she somehow never feels the one in charge. The conversations are pragmatic, even the murmurings and tiny notions creates an everlasting impression, especially in its initial stages. The narration often surfs through various periods and is almost busy in itself to wait and breathe it all in, and this is where Feig comes in, his finesse on weaving out a nail-biting confrontation or close calls amps up this somewhat scattered script. Fieg has always had the potential to walk that thin line between sinister ideology and sketchy sequences, and this time he is armed with too much content to handle. His actual job in here is to extract all the crispy material and offer it a more personal touch to connect with the viewers, and he has brimmed the entire feature with such husky bits. The songs are up beating, the sound editing is impressive if not the background score, the cinematography is decent along with the editing and has calm and soothing camera work with stunning bright visuals. The narrative is gripping, adaptive and can be inedible at times, but the correct advice would be to nod along since most of the skipped steps are later closed in by accounting it into a circle. The tightly packed screenplay that keeps enfolding newer perspective and revealing and appealing characters as it ages on screen, Kendrick at the heart of it whose range never disappoints us and, Feig's long lasting passion whose euphoric energy never wears off in any frame, are the high points of the feature.

Truly great horror-comedy feature films are one of the most hard-to-find cinematographic feats these days; however, narratively and structurally, fusing seriously funny comedy in the narrative tidiness of a whodunit is even more meritorious to praise, a surgically handled work that only an expert on the mechanisms of these genres can achieve; here's a proof.One of the strongest hooks for this domestic noir is the daring style on the divas' attire specifically. Undeniably, the sizzling fineries Lively models with panache during the first two acts and Kendrick, self-indulgent, inherits in the last act pop up on the screen as another \u00e0 la mode main character. Each of these overwhelmingly fashioned moments comes from costume designer Ren\u00e9e Ehrlich Kalfus, who freezes the viewer up persistently with her original tuxedo designs and their corresponding model. The fashion designer wonderfully personalizes not only the pair of ladies, but the film itself through creations that defy gender standards, which the film runs from several fronts. You are not ready for that navy three-piece suit and six-inch heels, bad weather and umbrella included.Based on Darcey Bell's homonymous novel, the script is penned by Jessica Sharzer\u2014 2016 summer surprise \"Nerve\" screenwriter \u2014with additional Feig touches on it. Joining up the collection of film adaptations based on mystery books featuring women in morally ambiguous situations, with homicides, supposed suicides and dark places driving the plot forward, Sharzer does what she can to remain faithful to the source story, distilling the key points from Bell's novel. But in \"Gone Girl,\" \"The Girl On The Train\" times, her writing falls short delivering solid resolutions, the pyrotechnics and suspicious events of the first hour are drowned by an out-of-control whirlwind of conclusions layering one after the other with less and less credibility. Emily Nelson is unhappy. We know it from the first moment because of her relationship with her only child, her creatively blocked husband, her job and her almost nonexistent social circle. Still, she's a confident, successful, classy, capable and ungovernable woman. But when her \"perfection\" is threatened by a forthcoming bankruptcy, her true self comes up. After the titular simple favor, she goes missing and the \"why-where-how\" kind of stuff unfolds.  Blake Lively, despite not being a high-grossing star, is one of the film's faces towards financial success.  Lively is in good hands portraying a sinister, enthralling femme fatale. Embodying Emily in an overwhelming natural way, her caustic, forceful performance achieves to blur the line between innocence and guilt, and that, in this film, means mission accomplished.Kendrick gives a career-best performance. Lively's already proved herself years ago, Kendrick, even with her Academy nomination, has been involved mostly in humor-related flicks, keeping her distance from powerful, serious character-driven plots. Heroine and villain, Stephanie's the real star here. Widow, helicopter parent, detective and vlogger at once, her evolutionary arc is, besides more plausible than Emily's, wildly enjoyable, veering from mistress to stepmother, from bosom friend to enemy with explosive sympathy. Kendrick's great, so does Lively, but together, they're a bomb of secrets, surprises and seduction; one of the most unique, brilliant female duos in a long time.\"A Simple Favor\" by Paul Feig could be mistaken for a vicious, riotous noir experiment by the director and producer behind \"Bridesmaids,\" however, those who are willing to get a ticket for this fiery cocktail won't feel ripped off up until the third act. Feig gives a half-baked impression of a chic Hitchcock through missing girl genre-worthy storytelling ideas, with fortuitous and gratuitous twists that will delight those who chortled when they shouldn't minutes ago. The cast is unbeatable, its posture is stylish by means of eye-popping outfits, an exquisite and elegant French soundtrack, a production design that is colorfully synthetic and a deficient but focused cinematography. The story falls into an overhasty, depraved spiral of revelations halfway through that, in the end, is a ploy to deliver the best Kendrick's performance to date, showcase underestimated Lively's talents and Feig's skills to surprise in every way. Final oversaturation certainly makes the story an incohesive whole, but the new side of the director, its costume design and the electric chemistry between the stellar ladies are enough incentives to treat the final-act hangover."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "\"A Simple Favor\" was a good movie, but not so much because of the confused and leisurely plot, but the performances of Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick were the ones that stood out most in the film, and also entertains."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "o filme inicia de uma maneira e a sua narrativa muda rapidamente se tornando um suspense e misterio, onde ocorre a transi\u00e7\u00e3o da personalidade da protagonista, podemos dizer uma certa evolu\u00e7\u00e3o, bela filmagem, boas atua\u00e7\u00f5es, narrativa interessante, trilha sonora boa contudo um filme bom."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Thriller that involves a mixtures of genres, in way witty.

The final act make you wonder of what genre belongs actually, or shall to watch again."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I wasn't initially going to see this. I'd been let down by similar neonoir mystery dramas before. (Felt Gone Girl was just okay and Girl on a Train was disappointing.) Then I heard the positive reviews and changed my mind. I'm glad I did.Director Paul Feig took the story from what appears to be a more serious book with very mixed reviews on Amazon.com and added humor and a bit of fun to the proceedings. The dark parts are appropriately lurid, but this isn't a dire slog. Witty dialogue and a game cast alleviate the proceedings.Although Blake Lively does a great job as the mysterious woman who goes missing (and hats off to whoever designed her clothes, they are fantastic), this is Anna Kendricks' film. As the slightly oddball, mommy vlogger Stephanie Smothers, Kendricks has the part nailed down a both physically and verbally as she quirkily deals with people.There are a couple flaws. The switch between drama and humor is a little jarring a in a few spots. The second act drags a little, and a few character decisions in the third act were rushed a bit.Overall, I'd recommend this."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "crizzyview! Campy, funny, devilish. Great fun. Loved it! I think it was under rated by critics and should do very well at the People\u2019s Choice awards."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Paul Feig makes it clear once again how limited is as a filmmaker and his biggest mistakes here is that he never seems to be sure of what he wanted to do.A Simple Favor combines drama, mystery, crime, comedy and suspense in a plot that revolves all those elements but never manages to follow a straight path to be able to direct itself towards something more cohesive and therefore much more entertaining.Very soon I notice that the plot twists are done more to keep you attentive than because they're really necessary and at all times they feel forced and frankly lacking the dramatic weight and surprising effect they think they have.The main actresses? They're maybe the biggest disappointments. Even if we consider the completely lack of chemistry between both of them. The worst is their personality.Anna Kendrick character is downright foolish and almost the whole film she plays the typical single mother who tries to be friendly and quirky but who also has a dark side and usually takes the reins of the situation when the situation involves sex as shown by the two sequences in which she sleeps with her half brother and her \"friend's\" husband but something else? No, the character is as simplistic as it is predictable.Blake Lively tries to bring more attitude to the scenes but in all the moments in which her character presses and becomes more somber it seems a huge copy of what Rosemund Pike did with Amy Elliott in Gone Girl. Pike did it much better and in a much better film.Honestly for me there was nothing special in this film. Beyond my disappointment, it seemed an incredibly boring experience that was neither funny nor dramatic nor mysterious enough to compensate for the time invested."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "This exceeded my expectations, and managed to be a thriller within a comedy.

The way the two main women characters played against each other was brilliant.  The movie was much funnier than I expected and a lot less of a thriller.  I walked out of the movie with my friend who dragged me out to see it, and we were both amazed about how we both underestimated the movie, both really enjoyed it.  I hope people give this movie a chance, and then give this movie the reviews it deserves."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Fun mystery comedy that is a little too predictable and not quite funny or charming enough to be great or a classic. Will simply go down as decent yet forgettable time worth viewing once or twice."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This movie is extremely versatile. There's tension, thrilling moments, (dark) humour and unexpected plot developments. On top of that, I enjoyed the visuals, the chemistry between the characters and the acting was great too. I only refrain from giving this movie a 10/10 because at some point there was a bit too much dark humour for my taste. Otherwise it's a movie I'd definitely recommend."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "I really didn\u2019t want to see this movie, and I had very low expectations thanks to Paul Feig\u2019s feminist ghost movie. It was better than I expected, I can say that. A few of the jokes made me chuckle, and some things that weren\u2019t jokes made me chuckle. I was really excited that this was going to be really good once the opening started with the song and the appealing and stylized visuals, and then it immediately cuts to Anna Kendrick\u2019s character making a vlog for moms. That\u2019s the thing about this movie, every time it did something I liked, something else either undercut it or just made it worse overall. It has a lot of good ideas that I would love to see done differently and, frankly, better. This movie does have a decent style to it though. I like the scenes that are completely silent flashbacks except for one or two characters telling the story of what\u2019s happening or just talking over it. The plot was really stupid and complicated for no reason. I found myself totally lost multiple times. And just to be clear, a movie can have a complicated plot if it\u2019s explained well, otherwise, it\u2019s just confusing. The dialogue is pretty cringe at times as well. It\u2019s not always awful, but it\u2019s not great overall. Also, the characters are actually not total idiots, which I did like. But the characters do change their minds pretty frequently for no reason except because the script said so. For example, Blake Lively\u2019s character\u2019s husband switches between Lively and Kendrick every ten minutes and it\u2019s really distracting. Also, he fakes being with one or the other, but the actor does a terrible job of conveying this, so you never really know what\u2019s going on with him. Not only is he not great in this movie, but I personally think Kendrick should stick with comedies. She\u2019s not bad here, but definitely not good. I thought Lively was good though. Oh, also, I thought the scene with Lively\u2019s character throwing the wrench up and hitting herself with it was done terribly and I laughed really hard. The wrench was falling way too slow to look even close to right. You should have enough time to put on a necklace as a wrench is falling from that height onto your eye. Also, I don\u2019t know how many people could throw a wrench that high. I couldn\u2019t. And here aim must be amazing to get it exactly where she wants it. And how did know it wasn\u2019t gonna land wrong and just permanently mess her face up really badly? This scene is an example of how, besides the plot and dialogue, it\u2019s just the little things that make this movie worse they it could be. If a different director made this movie, it could\u2019ve been pretty good in every sense of the word."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I can't remember movie like it where it has a relevant humor and jokes with a wonderful narrative and thriller's side. It was a interesting film with the ambiguous ending that seems as real story"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I found the movie to be very enjoyable, though it has rough patches with stilted dialog and some difficult-to-swallow moments.Otherwise, Anna Kendrick is quirky and Blake Lively is hot, and that's about all that can be said about the movie without spoiling it."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "I enjoyed this film as a mindless audience member. Each thrill and twist made me animate emotions really well. At the end of the day though, it wasn\u2019t a solid film. That is contradicting but, what I think most audiences and critics can agree on is that the first half or so is brilliant then it starts going off the rails. I can`t put my finger on it but some things just don\u2019t click together. The three main actors do click and do act their collective cute fox socks off but it\u2019s something with the writing and how everything gets ended in the third act. One of my favorite thrillers is Disturbia from 2007, it starred Shia LaBeouf. It was a perfect thriller. Sure, it was a horror thriller while a Simple Favor is I guess a comedy-thriller. Disturbia goes along perfectly on one linear path. Get evidence to convict a serial killer. There are tiny branches of plot that help the movie along or make our heroes path more complicated. In A Simple Favor, there are so many branches that extend from this movie`s main plot. A incest bastard child, child abuse, murder, arson, lesbian romance, affairs, after funeral sexy time. Everything I mentioned is a critical plot point that needs to happen so this film can have its outcome. It`s too much. This film`s ending is too much. Character actions don\u2019t make sense at times. There are a lot of implied situations that could have been useful if someone just said it out loud to help some of the audience."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "IF you don't mind the thriller>comedy bait&switch, ASF is surely entertaining and has its moments of suspense; an easy watch."}], "recommendations": ["terminal", "the_woman_in_the_window", "bad_times_at_the_el_royale", "gone_girl", "thoroughbreds", "lucky_number_slevin", "widows", "good_time", "cold_pursuit", "knives_out", "nerve", "colossal", "the_raven", "the_tourist", "last_night_in_soho", "hanna", "ready_or_not", "the_number_23", "before_i_go_to_sleep", "reminiscence", "the_accountant", "savages", "broken_city", "magic_mikes_last_dance", "the_nice_guys"]}
