It's a movie that filled me with a lot of positive feelings and a comedy that I strongly recommend.\r White Goodman (Ben Stiller) is an egotistical gym owner, he owns and runs a successful gymnasium called \"Globo Gym\" which is where business is going pretty good thanks to its high quality machinery and facilities. Over on the other side lies \"Average Joe's\" Gymnasium, owned by Peter LaFleur (Vince Vaughn), and is more of a run-down gym and only has few members. When Peter meets Katie Veach (Christine Taylor) and she tells him that all his bills are overdue, he then finds out that White of Globo Gym wants to buy Average Joe's leaving him in a difficult financial situation.\r Peter, along with his crew including; Justin (Justin Long), Gordon (Stephen Root), Steve (Alan Tudyk), Owen (Joel Moore) and Dwight (Chris Williams) must find different ways to make money in order to keep the gym. They then hear about a Dodgeball tournament in Las Vegas where there is a cash prize that they can use to keep the gym and not let White get anywhere near it.\r When it seems that they are not able to get the gym and their Dodgeball skills are not quite up to standards, Peter then bumps into Dodgeball legend Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn) and he teaches them, in a series of funny methods, how to play professional Dodgeball and win the Las Vegas tournament.\r This is a very fast-paced and wacky comedy, Ben Stiller is great at playing the annoying, egotistical and sometimes elaborate White Goodman. All of the comedy is also perfectly timed to know when it's the right time to be funny. The physical humor including seeing a number of men getting hit by Dodgeballs never gets tiring.\r To put it short, 'Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story' is worth your time."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "First of all, it's a crazy comedy film, keep that in mind, it never pretended to be anything else. Got it? Good. For what it is, it's glorious! For its class, it's one of the best. Usually crazy comedies are poorly written, don't bother with plot and are generally offensive to every one of the senses. This is one is a crafty, lovingly made film with the right amounts of quips and jokes, even the gratuitous slutty girls. Every casting choice was perfect, even the insufferable Me'shell.

There are enough laugh-out-loud bits to warrant a viewing. Hell, the cameos alone are worth a ticket purchase.

Often the comedy genre is taken lightly. Though he does not. But also that is not to say that he sticks by the rhythm that he not only develops but succeeds on. There is this questionable urge of his to end all the jokes with a pinch of drama that is to ground all the tomfoolery acts they live by. This lawyer nature of the film comes off pretentious, obviously, but also stinks of desperation. Desperation to reach the higher value than it can sum up, even in a problem simple as such and stakes lower as such. Yet, what saves him, is his first instinct itself.The tendency to turn the cartoonish characters to 11. And for the most part of the film the characterization of those characters that is branched out in the editing process smartly (in the script itself) and not taken as an uncalled detour just for the maker's pleasure. The only sequence where it fails poorly is the training montage where our amateur heroes prepare for the ultimate tournament. Now, usually those are the best elements in a comedy film.But their work is, frankly, lazy. Those series of snippets is nothing but mindless hits and punches and misthrown beats and physical errors, that never for a frame goes innovative. Which, if I may, would describe the entire track of that team. They never live up to the ferocity with which Ben Stiller challenges them. There is no way anything in the film could match his unflinching promise to the character let alone other characters hovering around minding their sub plots and petty issues. He doesn't care about the plot points, jokes, opposite cast or even Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Just another sports comedy ...This film is a slapstick-like comedy that brings us a little-known \"sport\": dodgeball, a game that, for us in Europe, is more connoted with childhood and school than with the world of professional and federated sports. Here in Portugal it is called \"Queimada\" or \"Game of the Forest\".The script is based on the boundless rivalry between Peter La Fleur, the owner of a small gym, and White Goodman, the owner of a gym corporation, who opens yet another establishment, right outside the door of La Fleur's gym. Things get worse when La Fleur is truly in danger of losing its small gym to its direct competitor. To pay what they owe, they decide to participate in the National Dodgeball Championship, where Goodman is already registered.This movie is nothing new or original. The exposed plot is similar in everything to dozens of other sports-themed films, where the good ones try to beat the bad guys within four lines, while the bad guys try to use all means, including cheating, to win. It's a markedly humorous movie, with jokes all the time ... some of which are really funny while others not so much. It is a style of humor that does not appeal to everyone, but it will appeal to those who already like this genre.Ben Stiller is an actor with a lot of experience in this type of comedy, where he fits perfectly, and he is responsible for most of the jokes, with a strongly cartoon character and with touches of social criticism. I liked the work of the actor, he really steals attention for himself and not always (almost never) had anyone to shoulder with him. Vince Vaughn was up to the character and gave him a touch of honesty and sincerity, but is too serious to make him laugh. Christine Taylor is the girl in the movie, but it doesn't do much more than be a presumed future romantic pair of Vaughn's character. The rest of the cast gives the essential support and is funny when it has to be. In addition, we have small cameos from Lance Armstrong (it was not yet known how he truly won the Tour), Chuck Norris, David Hasselhoff and other well-known names.This movie is funny ... it doesn't make us laugh until it hurts, because many of the jokes used are not particularly elegant, but entertain the weather quite well and do not disappoint us."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "This movie honestly reminds me of Year 11 dodgeball, quite fun to be honest."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Not very funny alright in some parts and a few laughs not much though    ."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "About what one can expect from a Vaughn & Stiller comedy, but the dodgeball scenes + commentary deliver a few good laughs."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Dodgeball is a sport that kind of sucks.
