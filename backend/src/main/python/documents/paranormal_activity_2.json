I did think the first was bad but clever for what it did on the budget. This is heart stopping. Every time it is night in the house you know that something is going to happen but you don't know exactly how. I believe the larger budget helped this time. It still has 'wooooh the door is moving but what is moving the door' moments and there are some plot inacuracies and confusions but apart from that I was definitly clinging to the person I was with during the final sequences. Awesome and very scary, just dont make a third one...please."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "after this franchise got ruined with Paranormal Activity 3, 4 and The Marked Ones, let's talk about its real chapters. so, i love Paranormal Activity! it was just a simple found footage horror movie that had one camera placed in the bedroom to film what happens at night when everybody's asleep. it sounds boring but it was creepy and chilling as hell! so, it was a huge smash hit and it spawned 3 sequels, a Latin spin-off and a fifth movie that comes out later this year. but i'm here talk about the sequel that stays true to the franchise and the first movie, and that's Paranormal Activity 2. it's a prequel to the first movie that shows Kristi's family being haunted by the demon ever since their little son Hunter was born. and i really liked at how true Paranormal Activity 2 stands to the first movie. it's still able to make your hair stand up and make you go pale white, with goosebumps all over you. i swear to god, there were a few scenes in the movie were it got so chilling, that i was just shaking outta control. the first movie did that and this one did it too. now, to be honest: the movie seems to start up pretty slow. like there's nothing really happening in the first act and at the beginning of the second act. but then, when stuff start happening, it's a real **** nightmare for Kristi's family and it just makes your pulse throb. like i said, Paranormal Activity 3, 4 and The Marked Ones were pretty much the same thing, but they weren't creepy. they were just filled with jump scares that irritates the **** outta you. and that's why Paranormal Activity 2 is the best sequel in the franchise so far, cause it actually stays true to the first movie."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Most of the film flips through the same static shots where nothing usually happens, except for a bump in the night or some \"paranormal activity.\"  The movie mostly takes place inside some ordinary house, which limits the creepiness and makes it pretty boring to watch.  Ooo, another still-shot of the kitchen...and nothing happens!  Again!  The characters are mundane and foolish, and the film never establishes a true connection to these people.  I really couldn't care what happened to these characters because I barely got to know them.  The plot is pencil-thin, and the ending is anti-climatic and not suspenseful at all - a HUGE wasted opportunity in what should have been the scariest part.  I am being harsh, but I honestly didn't jump out of my seat once.

I been scared the whole time just thinking about it,but I guess the sequel is more less than the original. It wasn't much as good as the first one,since the first one is really scary to watch and it's the most scariest film of all time. My biggest problem is that they spoil the movie with the teaser trailer and all I could say this is that why we're having a baby and a dog in the scene like this? People concern this teaser the whole time and it does sucked when the trailer shows the audience seeing the movie in green screen since last year. The characters are alright,but not much good as Katie and Micah does. I like the security cameras when they show the scene where the ghost is doing in six shots. It has some lame talking scenes that I didn't interested to hear,all we want is scaring,because we didn't care about the story. It does has the same setting as the the first one and it has the same dialogue too. But this one is the prequel,it tells the story where Katie meet the family and they got spooked in the house before the couple started taping the evidence. It did get scared in four moments with large sounds and it's quite silly in the movie,but I prefer the first one and this sequel is less than scary,not bad and it wasn't quite special."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This movie is an example of how a low budget film can acheive some glory.It takes a little bit to get started, but by the end I was watching every door and shadow with horror.Enjoyable for fans of The Blair Witch project"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "A rare horror sequel that's every bit as terrifying as the original.

At first I was a bit uneasy, as the first half of the movie is very slow to get into anything, but as soon as things started happening, it was incredibly frightening.

My only critique: will not do well in a household setting, just like its predecessor. You MUST see this film in theaters. Go. Right now. I don't care if you're at work/school/prison. Right now.

However, I'm sorry but there was absolutely nothing terrifying about this movie. The first version had more bone chilling moments, and a lot more scenes where one would be scared (not me because I don't get scared by movies) but after gauging the reaction from my partner, who scares easily, and the rest of the crowd, there were hardly any moments in this film that startled the entire audience, or even made my heart almost wan't to jump."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "One trick pony.  I don't think unexpected loud thumps count as scary, they are lazy and uncreative, which is the basis of why this movie sucked.  The first Paranormal Activity had suspense and the thought that this may actually be real.  Now everyone knows it's not real so instead of trying some new scares they just regurgitated the same \"scare\" moments of the first one (loud noises, slamming doors, shadows, people getting dragged).  I'm not saying that it didn't make me jump (the Kitchen scene in particular was scary $hit) but towards the end it seemed to jump the shark and become comical.  The last 20 minutes I just kept on thinking \"Are you for real?\"  I think the sequel had potential but it was just too poorly done for me to care."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "worst one out of all Paranormal Activities so far! my opinion but it is, acting is HORRIFYING, when Kristi gets dragged down the stairs it is VERY unrealistic!

So now we know, to the detriment of the original film's mythology, that among the moving things and unexplained noises in the Sloat household, there was, in retrospect, some normal activity, as well, some debunking, some collaboration with the unseen forces, in which man is shown to be capable of an evil far worse than any demon. Daniel(Brian Boland) orchestrates a transference, acting on his Latino housekeeper's instructions(not only do they clean houses, they clean souls, too), Kristi's husband sets a photo of Katie on fire, and is presumably the one who does the planting. Let the picture in the attic just be; let the Monoliths be. So now we know: both sisters married jerks. Daniel probably sleeps on the wrong side of the bed too, a coward, just like Micah, who in \"Paranormal Activity\", sleeps on the side farthest away from the doorway, so should a demon enter the bedroom, given the positioning on their bed, Katie looks like the brave one, since she's the first warm body that the poltergeist would encounter. Micah, by all appearances, uses Katie as bait, a means by which the amateur filmmaker can get the best-possible footage of their unwanted guest attacking his girlfriend. In \"Paranormal Activity 2\", it's the baby who takes the brunt of the supernatural malfeasance, with only a German Shephard, the family dog, standing sentry; a German Shephard who is no Lassie, since he fails to make his owners understand that they have a situation far worse than Timmy being stuck down some well. He doesn't bark loud and long enough. Too bad \"Paranormal Activity 2\" wasn't one of those talking animal films, if it was, the dog could tell his human owners to get the f*ck out, now. Speaking of talking dogs, what would Scooby-Doo say? Probably something along the lines of, \"Ruh-roh. The baby is sliding across the side of his crib. This is scarier than the Blair Witch twigs.\" Poor baby. Nobody thinks to check the playback on the surveillance footage that details the 'round-the-clock nursery going-ons, even though the family reviews the mystery of the gallivanting pool cleaner, and also the slamming door which locks Ali(Molly Ephraim) out. As is the case in all horror movies since time immemorial, the people are kept in harm's way due to the advice of the rational one, the singular hold-out to the new reality that defies reason, who ends up getting everybody killed, because of his(it's usually a guy) unbending stance against the mounting evidence which points to escape as being the most prudent course of action. In \"Paranormal Activity\", the couple stays because Micah wants to finish his movie. In the sequel, there is no such egocentric(Micah is willing to risk his girlfriend's life for his own selfish reasons), albeit intellectual basis for the family to remain as housemates with the devil. Daniel is just a tool. When it's too late, he turns to Martine(Vivis), the Hispanic maid he fires for being too superstitious. Ever the tool, with Kristi beset in a catatonic state(and in a biting mood), Daniel still gives his housekeeper static, as he protests in disbelief at having to use a cross for the purging. So now we know the pretext behind Katie's true identity, and just like the Star Child, our understanding of the circumstances that made them who they are, while may be interesting in a cursory way, a gimmick to drive each respective sequel, it threatens the purity of both \"2001: A Space Odyssey, and to a lesser, but proportionate degree, \"Paranormal Activity\", as well."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "\"Paranormal Activity 2 is a Halloween treat it brings the chills & thrills and is scary and more compulsive than the original , Tho the build up to the \"final nights\" are slow, its worth the shockingly and frighting conclusion that will have you screaming\" ..

The whole film was just long periods of noiseless filler between loud noises, as though this passes as some kind of entertainment or fear factor. Nearly all the plot elements were as thin as tissue paper, me and my friend were able to predict throughout; loud bang in the next 5 seconds, somethings going to move in here, etc. I say plot, but there wasn't really one to speak of, it was more or less a series of non-sequential events with slight connections towards the end. Of the 90 minutes there's probably only 10 minutes of footage where something even remotely interesting is going on. To be honest I have absolutely no idea how anyone can be giving this film a rating of more than 2/10, unless they were involved with the film, are critics who have completely lost their integrity to a pile of cash, or have the mental prowess of a toddler.

The scares, they weren't very good at all. They just sort of happened and they obviously weren't very thought out. Also; what the hell is up with this being a prequel, at the end, the possessed woman from the first movie comes to the house and kills everybody except for the kid.

I don't even remember the names of the characters, since a reason to care about them at all is never given. They're just bad actors trying to look natural, very similar to MTV's reality show stars. There is no suspense here--we get a massive amount of footage where *absolutely nothing happens at all*. The idea seems to be we're waiting for something to happen, and that's the suspense, since once in a while we get a...bump in the night, maybe. Not exactly frightening. The ending that it advertises as shocking is absolutely nothing. The original wasn't exactly a classic by any means, but this one is significantly worse. The movie is unsatisfying from beginning to end. Seriously, almost nothing happens at all. What does happen just isn't worth the effort to get there. Yeah, it ties into the first one at the end, but not in a way that really means anything at all. It's just thrown in there. There is no suspense, horror, or anything to keep you awake.

There are cameras than just the one from the last movie and there are more characters than just one couple.  But more does not make better.  In fact, it decreases the suspense.  More means there is less 'alone' time for the characters.  Also, the fear is spread amongst more people; therefore, it is felt less by each.  The film Paranormal Activity scared the crap out of me.  There were long, static shots of a room and an occasional event.  This time, the long shots are much shorter and since there are multiple cameras, no room is the main focus like the bedroom was last time.  Furthermore, there was no build up to an event last time.  A door would slam or the sheet would rustle all without warning.  Now there is a low, rumbling bass noise which signals a coming event.  This takes most of the fear of anticipation out of the scene.  The plot is actually connected to the previous film but I won't give away how.
