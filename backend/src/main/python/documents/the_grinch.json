Since yes he\u2019s a jerk but with a nice guy side throughout the film. This version is easily better than the Carrey one though. It may even get more of an emotional reaction than the original short. Still, it does nothing too spectacular with a story we all know by now."

It's nice holiday fun and is a slight improvement from the already alright \"The Lorax\" fronting with Zac Efron and Taylor Swift. Benedict Cumberbatch was a problem for me. I didn't like his voice behind the Grinch. Overall that was a pretty easy pill to swallow. The rest of the movie is fine, but it picked up in the third act. That was a tear jerker which was really uncommon for the quirky Illumination studio. Overall I enjoyed the film mildly but had some gripes that could've been fixed."

      "text": "First of all, the only really good thing about this movie was the animation. The animation in this movie was pretty good to look at. You can easily see that the animators put a lot of effort into how the movie looked. The pacing was pretty decent seeing how it\u2019s a kids movie. The pacing in the film felt around the same speed throughout the film and was easy to follow. Benedict Cumberbatch was ok as the Grinch. I\u2019m not sure if it was his fault or the dialogue in the film because the dialogue was cringy. There was so much forced humour in the film but seeing how this film is a kids film that is understandable. Now like I said before the pacing in the film is decent just not great. The book is sixty-nine pages long and they expanded it to a two hour and twenty-six-minute long movie so at some parts it seems to drag on. In my opinion, the last half of this film is better than the first and by that I mean the last twenty or so minutes. There is a subplot in this movie that really doesn\u2019t go anywhere so they could of just taken it out of the movie and probably make the movie a tiny bit better. The music in this film, which is scored by Danny Elfman, was actually pretty good but the the cover of the classic song wasn\u2019t. At least this movie has a good message for people to follow that Christmas is about family and friends and not the gifts under a tree. In the end. The Grinch is a nice movie for kids but is an unnecessary film. If you want to see a good Grinch movie watch the 1966 one."

It's obvious that the only people that cared even a little were the animation crew and Benedict Cumberbatch, and even he can't save this. I won't lie, I thought this movie had soem good ideas that were underused, like when the Grinch is, ya' know, stealing Christmas. The gadgets he uses were interesting and visually fun, but that's only about five minutes of the movie. I also did feel fairly festive during this movie thanks to the surprisingly beautiful animation. This is for sure the worst 'Grinch' adaptation. It's just like they stretched out the 20 page book into a 90 miute movie and gave Cindy Lou Who something to do to reach the expected length. The Jim Carrey 'Grinch' at least take some risks and expands upon the concept of the book. I'm not saying that movie is amazing or anythin, but I enjoying way more than this 'Grinch' just based on Carrey's performance alone. This not only the best, but my favorite movie from Illumination with 'Despicable Me' as a close second, which isn't really saying much since this is the second worst animated movie I've seen this year, with 'Early Man' taking the spot of the worst only because of the plot. I suggest you see this with your family, chug some spiked egg nog (as long as your at least 21 years of age), turn your brain off, and enjoy the pretty lights and colors. That's the best way to watch this movie."

Most of it is absolutely perfectly paced, but some parts such as [spoiler]    aren't well thought out, but still make it so good. Cindy-Lou is different in a great way, and it so well expands on these characters and adds so many new ones which just fit in really well. Overall, this is one of the most well thought out remakes ever; it's colorful, fun, and enjoyable and is impossible not to love."

In fact, the studio also seems to not learn its lesson from the mediocrity of Minions, Despicable Me 3, The Secret Life of Pets, and Sing. The Grinch unfortunately ended up having the exact same problems that The Lorax had. Instead of sexual innuendos as the time filler as you saw it in that How the Grinch Stole Christmas movie from 2000, The Grinch uses pop culture references as the time filler and whether that improves Dr. Suess's film adaptation library or not depends on how stale the jokes will become in the next couple of years. I can quickly say that with a film that barely explains its plot to the audience these jokes will not hold up for long."

      "text": "There are some Christmas traditions that are non-negotiable for a vast majority of people; gifts, excessive spending, eggnog, mistletoe and of course, watching some of your all-time favourite Christmas movies. While everyone has their own personal favourites, I can easily bet that one of those holiday tradition films, thats easily labeled as a \u2018required viewing\u2019 for the festive season is the 1966 Boris Karloff TV special How The Grinch Stole Christmas! Growing up and even today, its hard to flip through the channels without catching the original special. Yet, no matter how many times we\u2019ve seen it before, or what part the special is on once you flip onto it, you can sure bet that the special will more than likely be watched until its heart-warming ending. Too bad, I\u2019m sure the same can\u2019t be said with the 2000 live action remake starring Jim Carrey. Luckily, 2018 has brought us a new, brighter and greener Mr.Grinch. From Illumination, the studio that brought us those adorable little minions we can\u2019t get enough of, The Grinch is a vast, richly coloured, fun and most importantly, loyal addition to the Dr. Seuss canon; proving that sometimes, changing too much of a good thing, isn\u2019t always better. Instead, Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s newest interpretation of the Grinch is loyal to the Boris Karloff original, channeling his wicked sense of humour, dark and twisted hate of a joyful holiday and its gleeful spirit and most of all, some exceptionally great voice work.While almost everyone knows the basic narrative of the original story, this version pits us in a similar Whoville that we are all used to, but this time, the Mayor of Whoville, Mayor McGerkle (Angela Lansbury, yes the mayor is now a woman) declares Christmas be three times bigger; kind of ironic for a guy who\u2019s heart is three times smaller than the average heart.At an hour longer than the original film, you would think that screenwriters Michael LeSieur and Tommy Swerdlow would dabble deeper into the past of a cute and small little fella, yet, despite brief flashbacks of a baby grinch in an empty orphanage, these questions aren\u2019t really relevant in a child-friendly animation film in 2018 thats main intent is to cash in on cute and memorable commercial products for the 2018 holiday market. Even with very short and quick flashbacks of The Grinch\u2019s Christmasless past, our miserable antagonist cannot seem too shake off these awful memories, no matter how much people around him, including the most cheerful who-of-them-all, The Grinch\u2019s neighbour Mr.Bricklebaum (Kenan Thompson) tries to cheer our foul smelling greenie; nothing seems to glow his cold, cold heart.Although its been over fifty years since the original aired, and almost two decades since the live action remake, there is something special about experiencing such an iconic cinematic character being cherished by children for the first time. Luckily for myself, despite all the genuine laughs, gags and jokes that I found myself chuckling to, one fo the best parts of experiencing The Grinch was hearing the cheers, laugher and questions of the kids around me in the theatre. Asking their parents why he is so mean, why is our titular character is so green when everyone is \u2018normal\u2019, and if the movie is done with every fade out. Despite the endless kicks to the back of my seat from the youngster behind me, nothing melted my heart more than hearing their little chuckles with every thrown snowball and sight-gag involving The Grinch.Illumination, who luckily decided to really modernize the original story, and add its signature flare of whacky colours, vibrant animation and silly humour, does a fantastic job of staying true to the original, without ever compromising the fresh and radiant look of this 2018 version. Keeping many of the original characters was also a great choice, including the girl who challenges the grumpiness of favourite animated Scrooge, Cindy Lou Who (Cameron Seely), as well as, one of my loyal favourites, Max, the Grinch\u2019s trusty yet sweet and loyal sole companion. Max warms your heart with each smile, wag, bark, drool and use of his powerful puppy-eyes.Yet, while the 2018 Grinch is a faithful interpretation, there are a few additions that we cannot help but fall in love with, including a yack-like looking reindeer Fred. Fred may be a tad overweight, have a slight obsession with whipped cream and pretty well eat anything in his sight (including Grinchie\u2019s hair), Fred is a fantastic addition to the world of Dr.Suess, especially this adaptation of The Grinch. Along with Max, the two front-runners to guide the Grinch\u2019s sleight that night, give the audiences the majority of the laughs to a newly vamped up Christmas classic.While The Grinch\u2019s message of warmth and wonder is simple and never really changes between fifty years and three adaptations, it seems like each and every year, all of us need a real reminder of what the holidays are all about."

And also that one guy who wrote the article on Variety about Chris Meledandri being the most powerful man in Animation. Now onto the review.You know what\u2019s funny about The Grinch? The fact that I actually had hopes for it (being in the current status of a Universal Hater). Not the highest hopes,but some...Take it as an almost finished box of chocolate.After seeing the movie,not only did I dislike the movie,but you can go read my review of Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom and nothing changes (except the JURASSIC UNIVERSE thing). Or just stay here and read all the way to the end.It\u2019s not as dreadful as that movie,though.  There are nice things I can say about it. I love the cave where The Grinch lives. It\u2019s full of inventive contraptions and it\u2019s always a blast to see it in motion. Just like the gadgets used in the third act,where he steals Christmas. SO MANY COOL GADGETS. Like,you have a candybar that hides a net to steal some presents,a pair of boots that can send you up in the air\u2026 James Bond would be proud.Unfortunately (or not) this is where the good stuff ends,because...MAN,this was a hateful ride. Let\u2019s get this off the way: This may be the worst Danny Elfman score I\u2019ve ever heard. There\u2019s nothing redeeming or fine about it. Say what you want about James Horner (RIP)\u2019s score of the 2000\u2019s Version. That at least brought something new to the table. The movie takes the record at ruining the source material. The Grinch is mean,but he sometimes takes a step back and get either emotional or happy. 2 sizes too small my TNT,movie! And when it gets to the source material,it\u2019s just gone like that. Either nothing happens or it was ruined by Pharrell Williams narrating his next paycheck (were Videogames and Drones narrated in the book?)The animation is so hateful in this movie. Aside from the house and the cool gadgets,the character design is so baffling. I hate the Who\u2019s look so much,I\u2019d rather either rewatch the Ron Howard movie with the weird horrifying designs or just Horton Hears A Who. The city of Whoville is just bland and adds nothing new to the table.The comedy is just nothing in here. Not even Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s zany Grinch voice can save this movie from being bad.Overall,I didn\u2019t have a horrible time watching this movie (thank god),but still. There\u2019s nothing redeeming in terms of quality about this movie. Nothing works in this movie at all,and when it wants to work,it\u2019s quickly ruined by something stupid. Perhaps a reindeer who spits cream out of his nose? The Boris Karloff and Ron Howard versions of the Grinch were mean,but this one is better left off the toilet."

The Dr Seuss wild machine and creative naming is dialed back so much Whoville feels like a regular place with some eccentricities. Weirdly changes between rhyming and not - many lines are spoken as if they'll rhyme when they don't.  Pharrells' narration is awkward, and the remixed You're A Mean One is even more so.

This infamous Dr. Suess's novel has had many adaptation but none of them actually quite got its cinematic version right. Maybe it doesn't have enough content to run for an hour long period or maybe simply there isn't anything cinematic about it, either way the result has never bred the sincerity the original tale had. Still, reincarnating this old chestnut of social satire, Illumination has at least managed to make this hostile host more friendly and adaptable to the kids.Voicing the iconic and titled character of Dr. Suess's visionary world, is Benedict Cumberbatch, for whom, it seems like this grumpy version wasn't difficult to voice. Since his previous egoistic roles has offered him to be easily offended and annoyed by the social rigmarole, it seems almost as if like Cumberbatch was born for this role. And perhaps this is what Cumberbatch's big win is, he makes it look easy as it should. Other voicing actors does their job perfectly with Pharrell Williams narrating and Cameron Seely winning our hearts with her cute voice over on Cindy-Lou Who.The music being a major part of this film is surprisingly good, not the on screen musical numbers sung by the actors, but the up beating background score. One would have assumed that remaking this fairy tale- almost -would mean that the makers have something new to invest in this storytelling, unfortunately, one mourns at the end of it. Kenan Thompson as the opposite personality to Cumberbatch, steals the show with his uncalled enthusiasm and hilarious one-liners. The Grinch works- sort of- in reverse for us, if the lead character turns from being disappointed to satisfied."

Much of the original charm is gone too, with this adaptation trying much too hard to be different. And, at the end of the day, it just doesn't work.Cindy Lou has seemingly lost much of the childish innocence that made her relatable to the audience's current and younger years. The rhymes are \"modernized,\" but in doing so loose much of their original meaning.

I came out of the cinema baffled as to why anyone had to go back here again when there are so many other Christmas stories that could have graced our screens this year."

      "text": "Disappointing. So many unnecessary changes from the original. Why is Cindy Lou being raised by a single mom? The introduction of the reindeer and its family was unnecessary. Why did they feel the need to give the Grinch a \"best friend\"? The Jim Carrey movie was at least funny. This has a few cute moments, but on the whole, it's really contrived and boring."

La pel\u00edcula corre a cargo de Yarrow Cheney y se nota,en momentos de mas humor es palpable la mente creativa del autor a la que has visto varias de sus obras (que ahora por cierto est\u00e1n a cargo de super mario bros haber que sale de ah\u00ed) el car\u00e1cter de los personajes siempre es guiado por unos objetivos mas o menos cre\u00edbles y desarrollados pero es costumbre que sigan las mismas  pautas ((el humor)) odio repetirme pero es ah\u00ed de donde se extrae mas de los propios personajes y quiz\u00e1s es as\u00ed que muchos son incapaces de tom\u00e1rsela en serio y... si coincido el ver que un elenco de personajes utilicen  gags humor\u00edsticos para mostrar el como son sin extensos mon\u00f3logos donde se estudia su Sigue y si puede ser que estas mismas decisiones est\u00e9n dirigidas a un publico mas infantil pero no lo justifica todo pero podr\u00eda tirarme todo el d\u00eda repitiendo la misma tesis sin llegar a ning\u00fan lado as\u00ed que \u00bfen que me baso para decir todo esto?.bien empezamos por lo mas simple,Grinch odia la navidad simple y limpio (como kimgdom heaarts ah perd\u00f3n)  el prop\u00f3sito de nuestro protagonista es el alejarse de esos momentos de la estaci\u00f3n lo mas posible hasta que el barbas avisa del gran \u00b4\u00b4advenimiento\u00b4\u00b4 que se aproxima y pasadas unas pocas escenas de ver sufrir a nuestro protagonista,el duende verde empieza su dulce traves\u00eda por acabar con la alegr\u00eda de los ciudadanos del peque\u00f1o pueblo y es que todo repite el mismo patr\u00f3n broma,desarrollo y se ve todo muy compactado como para que de veras pueda creerme todo esto y oye ya que me estoy quejando tanto del humor de este se\u00f1or no estar\u00eda de mas indagar sobre como usa las bromas Yarrow Perrey como elemento narrativo \u00bfVerdad? si lo se es una mierda pero no me pagan por callarme as\u00ed que dejadme en paz.Emm \u00bfhab\u00e9is escuchado \u00bfo le\u00eddo? lo que dije antes? jeje olvidadlo todo por que no hay nadie dando me maletines (no co\u00f1o de verdad ya me gustar\u00eda)bueno basta de florituras y vayamos al grano \u00bfde arroz? ejem,bien despu\u00e9s de haber superado el extenso trayecto hasta la gran pantalla,comprar las entradas y coger las palomitas iniciamos finalmente el film,vemos a Grinch durmiendo tan a gusto en su cama hasta que llega la radio lo despierta y vemos el primer contacto con el protagonista con un arranque de ira destrozando la radio, de esta escena se extrae el comportamiento que tendr\u00e1 el moco verde durante gran parte del Film \u00bfEs algo simplificado? si pero es muy c\u00f3modo el re\u00edr y observar  mas sobre los personajes sin tener que molestarnos en estudiar di\u00e1logos insoportables (\u00a1Evangelion me cago en la puta!).pero \u00bfhasta que punto puedo perdonarlo todo? esa es la pregunta y no tiene mucha dificultad.No no puedo simplemente el ver personajes mal presentados por la magia de la navidad al final todo acaba en la misma pregunta \u00bfte a gustado? pues si pero no podr\u00eda decir que es lo mejor para despedir 2018 casi dir\u00eda que os fueseis a veros Dragon Ball Super Broly (aliento) mirad si os gusta Grinch esta bien algunos dir\u00e9is que est\u00e1is aqu\u00ed por el humor pero creo que a los genios o los grandes estudios hay que exigirles mas sean quienes sean total no creo que nadie vaya a verme estas navidades creo que sera otro d\u00eda viendo culebrones en Netflix,estoy tan solo"

      "text": "I'll start with saying I'm a huge Jim Carrey Grinch fan, which for me sets the bar high for any subsequent Grinch movies. But even when not comparing to it, this Grinch movie can best be summed up as, \"Meh.\" It's good for a few cheap laughs your kids will certainly like, but as I saw in my theater it won't be enough to hold their attention the full 90-minute runtime. And honestly, they took the original animated Grinch with a runtime of 30 minutes and made it an hour and a half. But the biggest miss this movie made was the decision to take the mystery and fear the Whos had of the Grinch and take it away...they made him just another \"person\" they see in the streets, and really only seem to be mildly aware of his existence most of the time. All in all, it's a middling Christmas movie that may make you smirk and even get the feels at times, but won't be the movie you think of going forward come Christmas time."

The only reason I don't think its the worse film I've seen is because it has good visuals and even then illumination had to cut corners even though they knew it was gonna make hundreds of millions of dollars."
