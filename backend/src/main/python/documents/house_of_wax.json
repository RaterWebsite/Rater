Although essentially just a very creative slasher film the movie benefits from some great ideas and a wonderful setup. Plus the performances are strong all around from sexy bad boy Chad Michael Murray, bad ass final twin Elisha Cuthbert, handsome Jated Padalecki, hunky maniac Brian Vsn Holt and surprisingly Paris Hilton. Her attack scene is the film's most intense and brutal ten minutes. Although ultimately it falls into cliched horror tropes the movie surrounding it is innovative and inspired.3.5/5"

In the beginning it is a bit slow- which was okey, because it builds-up) and there was some unnecessary sub-plots that did not add anything to the movie (e.g. Paris' Hilton's characters'pregnancy)...but overall it was good. Although I am not that fun of gore, I have to say this was smartly used, and even though the movie was quite visual and there was indeed gruesome stuff, it was there when it was needed..Some may argue that there are some parts in the movie that are unbelievabIe... well, if we give real attention to the movie we will realise that these part are not that illogical really and make sense; any case, the movie is a horror movie,and horror movies are not meant to be always 'realistic'-although we would prefer if they were. Of course this is not a 'superior' movie, but it is fun and keeps you in suspense. As for Paris Hilton's performance (everybody seems to have a said about it), I am not fond of her, but I think she did all right. The movies is not about her, so go and watch the movies seeing her just a one more actress and not as a 'socialite' performing in a movie, because if you do, then your own bias would give you a hard time and you would be unfair to her or/and to the other actors involved.  In general, the performances were decent, no more, not less.Paris' role was little, not particularly important but since there were only two girls of the movie, her role was complementary to Alysha's. Period."

      "text": "This film is a remake of a horror film from the Fifties which, despite its age and not being so visually striking, is more interesting from the point of view of the story it tells us. Despite this, this film gives us more or less what it intends to give us and there are a series of moments in which the film, if it is not capable of frightening, at least impresses and makes some pleasant tension.The film begins as an ordinary teen film, with young people traveling to watch a sport match. They camp at night in the middle of a clearing but soon realize that there are people nearby. In the morning, a problem in one of the cars leads the group to ask for help in a nearby village, where a large wax museum visually stands out, totally made of wax, floor to roof, passing through all its interior. From here, we have a slasher film quite similar to so many others, where the characters trying to escape from a murderer who goes on killing them, one after another.One thing that stands out is the number of clich\u00e9s. Starting with the characters (we have the couple who only think about sex, the good-hearted hooligan, the nice girl who saves the day, the stupid boyfriend thought to be cut to pieces by the villain etc.) to the villains, one of them being a sort of clone from Jason Vorhees. The climax is somewhat predictable, however it makes good use of the fire of the 1950s film.I think the cast did the best they could with the material they received. It is not brilliant and there are no great actors here who can provide us with inspired interpretations. On the contrary, it is a cast of strangers. Even so, I would highlight the good performance of Chad Michael Murray and Elisha Cuthbert, both very convincing and skilled in the task of giving their characters a charisma and sympathy that holds the audience's attention. Paris Hilton, famous for the worst and most uninteresting reasons, appears here as an actress, which she is not and will never be. The proof is this film, where she does nothing but sex, appear half-naked and die. In fact, most of the cast is there to be slaughtered, as usual. Brian Van Holt is the face of evil in this film and was able to truly make chills with his cynical and brutal performance.Technically, it is a regular film, where the sets stands out for its excellent quality, in particular the wax museum, as is evident, but also the church and the villain's house, rich in details. Cinematography is good, but not surprising, and the lighting was very well done and well used to amplify tension and create the necessary suspense environment to make the film work. The deaths are very graphic and this can please fans of the gore. The characterization and make-up, in particular Vincent's, was very well done and is another element taken advantage of in the film of the 1950s. Less noticeable is the soundtrack, quite bland."

Some may wonder whether it bears any resemblance to the classic Vincent Price of the same name, other than the name it doesn't at all. I'd rather call it a re-imagining(and an inferior one at that) in alternative to a remake. And actually, despite it not being perfect and also my fears House of Wax was not that bad. It has its flaws, Paris Hilton not helped by her shallow character was awful, a few of the characters are less likable and developed well as others, the screenplay is rather cheesy at times and while Chad Michael Murray is handsome and does appeal to you I am not entirely sure whether he convinced me as the bad boy of the group. However, the rest of the acting is not bad at all, Elisha Cuthbert is actually very good and Brian Van Holt is downright scary as the antagonist. The characters are in a way stereotypical but they are written in a way that makes them generally somewhat likable. House of Wax is not bad to look at either, the camera technique used I am not a fan of but actually it is used effectively and there have been far worse cases of it, but the sets and lighting are wonderfully eerie. The story is on the formulaic side, but not dull or intelligence insulting. Other than Holt, what was impressive about House of Wax was the tense atmosphere, the imaginative and very gory deaths and also the fact that I did find myself amused or frightened throughout. Considering what House of Wax could have been, that is an achievement. All in all, not that bad, not perfect by any stretch but much worse things have happened. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
