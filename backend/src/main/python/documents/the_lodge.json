The scares and the overall horror are done amazingly well, there is one scene in particular that completely shocked me of how unpredictable it was, such brilliance can't be found that often in horror movies nowadays. The acting is soberbe, everyone was great, I think that Lia McHugh deserves a big recognition for this, with such young age, brought unbelievable emotion to this movie.More movies like this, Hereditary and The Babadook, that perfectly settles the tone of the movie and astounish us with such a beautiful cinematography, where every scene is shot with passion and big attention to the use of colours and light, should get more recognition, in a way that we can improve the horror cinematic, and start watching some good movies."

The first half is extremely strong, and if the movie had kept it up I would highly recommend it. Unfortunately, around the 1 hour mark, you might find yourself losing your patience as The Lodge keeps building its atmosphere after it is already solidly \"built.\" This results in a movie that is probably 15-20 minutes longer than it should be, and that narrative fat ends up draining a lot of tension. For me, the ending was effectively horrifying but also overdue.That being said, if you've already watched all the other highly-rated \"prestige\" horror movies of the 2010s, and you're craving a movie that's at least as classy as them, if not as polished, The Lodge is worth your time."

      "text": "Potential. And that's what's frustrating about it. \"The Lodge\" has the talent. The atmosphere. The plot, when it shines, is eerie and captivating. Where it leaks...are giant craters. Why would a father practically abandon his children in a cabin with the girl he cheated on their now-deceased mother with? I could believe this concept if he left another family member with them--a grandmother, maybe? Still...We needed more scenes with the father to fully understand his perspective. Otherwise, he is dull and selfish. Like others mentioned, I feel bad for the kids but don't see why they would drag out their prank for so long. Couldn't they overpower her, distract her? Throw ashes from the fire into her eyes, grab something and hit her with it? If they had tried those things, THEN failed, I would have been more convinced. But they never put up a fight. I suppose I understand feeling shocked into silence...but they never try to give it their all? Not once?"

      "text": "More creepy and moody that truly scary, The Lodge seems to have been borne in the wake of Hereditary. In fact, it uses the same convention of the model house and miniatures.  However, the performances are uniformly solid.  The father is fairly ordinary, but the kids are incredible, and the girlfriend is excellent.  The back-story - how the father got to know his girlfriend - is pretty fantastic. It's over-the-top, but sets the tone effectively for the rest of the film. There are a couple of nice twists, and some excellent sound cues. I'd recommend this one."

      "text": "Sadly, this movie is going criminally under noticed. This stylish, provocative, terrifying, disturbing horror thriller is brimming with strong performances all around. The movie centers on a pair of siblings who go away with their father and his new girlfriend after their mother has committed suicide. It's uncomfortable to say the least. And things get worse when the father had to leave for business. You see Grace the father's new girl suffered trauma some time ago when she was the only survivor of a suicide cult. Strange occurrences begin to happen from her missing clothes, to their loss of power and creepy voices and visions. The atmosphere is thick with dread and the movie is psychologically tormenting. The movie feels surreal and it's such a strange( in a good way) cinematic experience. I knew from pretty early on what was going to happen but I didn't know to what degree and was still shocked as things began to roll out. This was the movie I wanted Hereditary to be it's a aesthetically pleasing waking nightmare of a film. I would also like to point out Alicia Silverstone does the best work of her career here. In a small role she makes an amazing impression and in my opinion deserves some awards buzz.4.25/5"

      "text": "Taking cues from classics such as The Shining and Carrie, and modern day prestige horror such as The Witch and Hereditary, The Lodge is possibly the most chilling and unnerving horror film I\u2019ve seen in theaters. Does it, however, stick the landing as a film? Somewhat. The first half of the film is a masterclass in building dread - with its mix of religious anxiety and ripped from the headlines horror - while the remaining half, though successful at keeping the audience at the edge of their seats and causing heart palpitations, makes the inevitable descent into modern, atmospheric horror cliches. The film has a premise that is original enough, but contains too many moments of \u201cwe\u2019ve seen this before\u201d to truly rise to the level of absolute excellence. Despite the flaws, however, The Lodge is a worthwhile experience for horror film lovers who seek subtlety and religious themes in their horror."

      "text": "The Lodge is another horror film that bets heavily on atmosphere instead of the cheap scare. Obviously, that will divide the audience, but this is how it works nowadays and it's good that there are enough options that aren't trying to fool people with the same scares over and over again.Although I admit that it will be more to the liking of viewers who don't expect things to be so easy.Admittedly, the balance between intrigue and suspense isn't as ambiguous as I think the directors wanted to imply, but the film never falters in a serious way.Although I acknowledge that a slightly faster pace, not an accelerated one, would've been a little more useful, because as I said, the bet of the film goes for the atmosphere and the tension, but there comes a point where you can abuse of both and this film skims over that line multiple times.The conclusion is simmering but I felt that it didn't manage to be so satisfactory because even though the film embraces the supernatural element, ultimately it doesn't go all the way with it.Without spoiling, let's just say there isn't something great waiting behind the curtain.Personally I can say it deserves the opportunity. Just keep in mind what kind of horror you will be seeing."

Things get a bit creepy before going off the rails. There's potential here and the 2 kids (Jaeden Lieberher & Lia McHugh) turn in strong performances. Even their dread can't overcome the tedious lulls between the few minor frights. There's certainly an atmosphere of apprehensive expectation that permeates the proceedings, but there's not enuff payoff in scares or conclusion to make it worth sitting thru the slow parts."

      "text": "With \"The Lodge,\" co-directors Veronika Franz and Severin Fiala deliver a film that essentially abides by the same sort of elemental setup as their previous film, \"Goodnight Mommy.\" This time around, however, you're given entirely different circumstances and thematics to weed through as a viewer. Boasting an unforgettably pervasive sense of dread and a terrific assortment of images all throughout \u2014 both disturbing and otherwise \u2014 I'm quite confident when I say that I believe these filmmakers are amongst the cutting edge of indie horror. My only issue with the film is one that unfortunately trends into spoiler territory, so I'll suffice my thoughts with as much vaguery as I can. Basically, once things wrap up, you as an audience member quickly realize there's not really any character left you wish to root for. Still, though, the bleakness of that revelation kind of bolsters the film's thematic backbone. It's not exactly a satisfying watch, but for fans of other indie horror films that have caught so much attention in the past half-decade or so (i.e. \"It Follows,\" \"The Witch,\" \"Hereditary,\" etc.) I'd say it's borderline required viewing."

If you came to get scared, do not bother buying a ticket. This is a pure psychological thriller movie that leaves your head on a swivel on multiple occasions. Although there are many instances where you are thinking a scare will come, it never happens. The plot seems redundant, with some easily recognizable outcomes to surface while the character development seems to draw blank about 30 minutes in. This movie is also ver boring even though it was suppose to show suspense most of the time. The acting and cast seemed to be one of the weaker parts to the film. With Keough taking majority of the film, I thought she did great. The rest however, not so good. The rest of the cast seem to lack development and do not provide a chemistry that is needed for a film that has this small of a cast. There is only 4 main characters throughout the entirety of the film because most of it is at the Lodge. The cinematography is good. There were some interesting shots with the snow that enhanced the thriller aspect that is not normally seen in this category, which was enjoyable. There is a balance of good and bad, but I do not see the light at the end of the tunnel for this one. Not too bright. This is a film that is beyond predictable, with mediocre screenplay, and below average acting. In the end, cinematography can't save everything. The Lodge is definitely a movie that you wanna see once and never ever ever again."
