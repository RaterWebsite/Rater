      "text": "First of all, some reviews called this film a refreshing concept. Let me say that again: A refreshing original concept.Now I ask: ''Are you **** kidding me?'' There's tons of films about time loops!!!Also there's an obvious and clear comparison looming over this movie. I'm talking about Groundhog Day.When we start, we don't really have any idea of what we're seeing. Although we soon get a certain direction, but about 20 minutes pass and suddenly we understand that we're in a time loop. And that's where all the fun and my interest in this repetitive comedy ended.And it's that what comes next is nothing more than an empty effort to try to show that this story is more than it really is and more than anything it's irritating with its annoying edgy humor that's telling you that this is story is for ''adults'' but all their adults behave like people unable to leave behind their adolescence.At least it does that well.Much of the humor falls on Samberg and unfortunately I have only found him funny in Brooklyn Nine-Nine and it's difficult for him to be funny when his character is a cliche of cynicism.Also the film uses much of what was seen in Murray's classic, only that the focus is more interested in trying to convince the audience that it's an obviously more up-to-date story, but that doesn't necessarily make it more adult or proactive for that matter.The only thing that appears as a change is that another character joins Samberg's in his loop and obviously with that plot device you know where we're going with itPalm Springs it's an absurd and the film sells it like that, but absurdities must also be funny if it's supposed to be a comedy."

Este \u00e9 certamente um Must-See para fans do g\u00eanero - ou at\u00e9 mesmo para quem quer se aventurar no mesmo.First of all, Andy Samberg e Cristin Milioti est\u00e3o excelentes e carregam o filme numa facilidade enorme. Todo elenco est\u00e1 muito bem, mas o carisma de ambos \u00e9 contagiante e sem igual. Eles se d\u00e3o bem em cenas c\u00f4micas, dram\u00e1ticas e at\u00e9 mesmo profundas, porque o filme tem dessas e a abordagem da mesma traz um gosto agridoce muito bem balanceado.Os di\u00e1logos j\u00e1 s\u00e3o \u00f3timos o suficiente pra te prender em tela. Todo o comportamento do protagonista j\u00e1 era peculiar, mas depois do plot, tudo vira de cabe\u00e7a pra baixo. Lembro de me sentir surpreso, pois eu n\u00e3o sabia se o que est\u00e1 vendo era real - n\u00e3o ler a sinopse nunca foi t\u00e3o bom. A din\u00e2mica do longa muda, o que abre portas para um ritmo gostoso e ao mesmo tempo preocupante. O espa\u00e7o dado as emo\u00e7\u00f5es de ambos foi o suficiente, inclusive, a cena de raiva da Cristin Milioti ap\u00f3s ser presa \u00e9 FENOMENAL. Eu amo v\u00ea-la atuar, e toda saudade desde HIMYM foi bem restaurada. E \u00e9 claro que n\u00e3o posso deixar de citar a LEGENDARIA referencia a serie [no momento do primeiro tremor]. \u00c9 um presente e tanto aos fans.O humor \u00e9 bem vers\u00e1til. Por vezes sutil, ou exagerado, em alguns momentos quase **** Por fim, eu amei e cai na gargalhada em v\u00e1rios momentos. Gostei muito da Meredith Hagner como uma patricinha antip\u00e1tica. Mesmo que seja um estereotipo, n\u00e3o significa que seja f\u00e1cil de lidar. N\u00e3o do modo como ela fez. J. K. Simmons \u00e9 um ator marcante, e \u00e9 sempre bom v\u00ea-lo em tela . Aqui o mesmo n\u00e3o decepciona.O trabalho referente ao enredo, quanto a parte de fic\u00e7\u00e3o cientifica, \u00e9 bem adaptada. para evitar furos, o filme exige uma suspens\u00e3o da descren\u00e7a e algumas perguntas sem respostas. Comigo deu certo, al\u00e9m do mais, o filme nunca me prometeu isso."

      "text": "A great script and a phenomenal acting chemistry makes Palms Springs work in all levels. Siara\u2019s script makes use of the concept of time loop to explore the banalities of life. Nyles lived his looped life by just passing time, indulging into pleasure just to do it again the next day. In spite of having a life with no responsibilities at all, he felt lonely and tired thinking of what to do on his life in the present loop. Then, Sarah, having a problematic life of her own, got into the looped life and used this as an escape from her complicated life. The adventures of Sarah and Nyles in the looped life is definitely a dream for everyone. We all wanted to live a life with zero responsibilities but our characters would realize this is actually not how they can live life (or how we can live life). Nyles needs an emotional companion while Sarah has an urge to correct her wrongs (as she is always reminded by this whenever she wakes up from the bed of her sister\u2019s soon-to-be-husband). While all of these are happening, we are presented to the side character of Roy. I think Roy\u2019s take on the looped life is an opportunity to appreciate the things he never did before. He went from saying marriage is a bottomless pit of sorrow into realizing his kid watering **** as beautiful. He took a step back from whatever he is going through and just accepted life as it was and started appreciating every single detail his wife and kids are doing. But when he was informed of the possibility of getting out of the loop, he was ecstatic about it and for sure he would love to get out of the looped life because he knows how tolive his life. While for our main characters, they are unsure yet on how they will live once they get out of the loop but they have found each other in the loop and for them that is enough to live (which sounds really cheesy).The chemistry of Samberg and Millioti is phenomenal. I won\u2019t get tired watching these two drinking booze, shooting guns, and dancing in the bar full of thugs. Of course, J.K. Simmons will always be brilliant in what he does (the getting high scene with Samberg is one of the memorable scenes in the film, that laugh in the tub is the best). This is definitely a great quarantine film. We are all like in a loop at this moment. We just have to spend it as fruitful as we can. Let this be a time where we appreciate our family and our blessings. Learn something new. Teach someone something they do not know. I think this is the meaning of life, being there for the people around us. It was never meant for isolation."

What follows as the answer to that question is a heartfelt, deeply funny, and cathartic movie that acts as a deep drink of cool water in the barren hell of 2020. Now you've probably looked up this film by this point and there's one thing that probably sticks out like a present wrapped groin. When you think romantic comedy. Andy Samberg is not your first thought. Tom Hanks? Sure. Hugh Grant? of course. Matthew McConaughey? Not as of late but I'll give it to you.  But here we are...And he crushes it. He owns his part as a man aching to be free of this day, but nihilisticly embracing the lack of tomorrow. Now to be fair, the reason he does so well is that Kristin Millioti is an actual force of acting power. She displays emotion in such profound ways you can't help but emphasize with her character. Needing for her own personal hell of a day to come to some resolution. The script and cast work well together. Milotti and Samberg have such real chemistry it's almost more than just fiction, it's them. There are some parts that are foreseeable twists, and sometimes the directing reminds me of a student film, but if anything this adds to the charm of it. it never pretends to be anything more than it's not. It owns itself. it relishes in its moments of absurdity and basks in its moment of warm catharsis. Throw into that some classic J.K. Simmons with a wonderful ancillary plotline and you get a story that demands a repeat viewing. Just to hope if somehow you can relive watching this movie over...and over... and over... and over."

There's not much I can say about it really...its supposed to be a comedy but it didn't make me laugh. There are people like JK Simmons in the cast but otherwise its not worth noting really - its mildly watchable I suppose but nothing else really. It could have been better but just wasn't.

      "text": "This fun and offbeat comedy stars Andy Samberg as a laid-back guy attending a Palm Springs wedding who meets and hits it off with the maid of honor (Cristin Milioti). However, it's revealed that he's somehow been stuck in a time loop for quite some time, and has inadvertently trapped her in it with him. At first, I was a bit skeptical of this one, as I feel as though the whole time loop premise has been slightly overused in film and TV at this point. However, rave reviews, along with recommendations from friends and family finally swayed me into giving it a go, and thankfully I found it to be worth my while for the most part. It's not exactly a fresh take on the premise. Anybody who's seen films such as 'Groundhog Day', 'Happy Death Day', etc. are likely familiar with the tropes associated with the time loop subgenre, and they're all on display here (attempting suicide to try and escape the loop, living recklessly since the day will just start over tomorrow anyway, etc.) However, the film does carry a lot of heart with it, and the always reliable Andy Samberg and his comedic skills and timing pair great with Milioti's equally humorous performance. Their chemistry and onscreen antics are what really carry the film when all's said and done. Overall, it may be a bit run-of-the-mill as far as the time loop genre is concerned, but the charming performances from Samberg and Milioti made it just fun enough to keep me pretty entertained, and they offer plenty of laughs and fun moments throughout."

      "text": "I have always been a sucker for \"infinite time loop\" movies such as \"Groundhog Day\" and \"Edge of Tomorrow\". So I was already thrilled to see this movie and it was getting a lot of praise from all the critics. There was just one problem I've had when thinking of watching this movie. I am not a big fan of romcoms... Let\u2019s start with some of the praises I have with this movie. Firstly, one of the important aspects of a romcom is the chemistry between the two leads. In this case, Nyles (Andy Samberg) and Sarah Wilder (Cristin Millioti) have great chemistry that is charming and effective. There are so many great moments between the two and seeing both of them perform silly antics such as a well-choreographed dance number is funny yet heartwarming. There are also strong performances from the supporting cast who play annoying over the top people to the point you can sort of see where the main leads point come from. Roy (JK Simmons) is the most relevant supporting cast as he is the third time looper and it is great to see him give a more wacky performance but I do feel he is sort of underutilised. Although, the main focus is on the main leads and in that case the lack of focus on supporting characters works in the movie's favour. Another praise is that they found a unique way to tackle the time loop genre that differentiates itself from the other time loop comedy \"Groundhog Day\". Right from the get-go, it is obvious to us the audience that Nyles (Andy Samberg) has been in a long time loop and we are not learning about the loop with him but from him. Additionally, having multiple individuals in the time loop together allows for it to go in a unique direction. The director and writers utilising the time loop to show the relationship between the main leads developing and growing as individuals is fun to watch and sincere. They also use the time loop to as a plot device for surprise twist and revelations and the film certainly has a lot of great twists.Now onto flaws of the movie and the first comes straight away in the first 10 minutes and it is how raunchy it is. The trailer for the movie made it seem like a sincere and heartwarming time loop romcom, which it is to be fair it is, but this movie is extremely R Rated with it's over the top sex scenes that made me question if I was even watching the movie that was advertised. It gives a wrong first impression of the movie and I honestly wouldn't be surprised if someone stopped watching after the first 5 minutes because of how stupid and unnecessary these scenes are. I finished the movie and I still didn't get what these added to the movie. The answer is that it didn't and I question why they thought it was a great idea.The second flaw I have got to say is that this movie is defined as a \"romantic comedy\" and there are a lot of great romantic moments but honestly no moments that made me laugh out loud. They do a fair amount of \"The Lonely Island\" raunchy sex jokes but even then I still didn't find it funny. I got a couple of chuckles in some moments but none stuck out as memorable in the comedy department.  Overall, it is a surprisingly very good movie and I thoroughly enjoyed it but not to the extent of how everyone in the media felt about the movie. The most important aspect in a romance movie is to get the audience to root for the main couple and this movie succeeds in this case.  The movie is a great time if you ignore the first 10 minutes and you will no doubt come out enjoying it."

The film has some issues in pacing and some of the effects but it\u2019s so investing and entertaining. Most time loop movies take themselves seriously sometimes with the exception of this and Groundhogs Day. Palm Springs understands how dumb these movies can be and goes out of its way to be funny and most of the time, the humor works. For a first feature, Max Barbakow knocks it out of the park with his direction. It\u2019s well written and well shot with plenty of interesting ideas about how we live our life and love. Check this out on Hulu when you get the chance."

      "text": "Palm Springs review:Max Barbakow\u2019s new Groundhog Day inspired Rom-com is a fresh new take on the pre established formula. Cristin Milioti\u2019s Sarah falls victim to an infinite time loop on the day of her sister\u2019s wedding. The unique twist to the genre is that in this case she is also trapped with Andy Samberg\u2019s Nyles, who has been stuck in there so long that he doesn\u2019t remember much of his life beforehand, and together they try to find meaning in a reality where their actions are meaningless. The movie definitely has some quality moments of comedy, but underneath all the laughs it is a poignant reflection on life and depression. Whilst a huge part of this movie is obviously derivative of Groundhog Day, like other movies of the genre (for example Edge of tomorrow), it does enough it terms of originality and sheer enjoyment to stand on its own. If I delved into all the individual aspects that made this feel unique I\u2019d have to spoil the entire movie. Both Samberg and Milioti are phenomenal, and paired with some really sharp dialogue they are a both convincing and hilarious duo. Of course there are also moments of sincerity, and both actors pull them off perfectly. In Samberg\u2019s performance especially he shows many hints of sadness and misery, whether it be subtle or at other points straight up breaking up into tears. I\u2019d say my one issue with the film is that at times the there is a bit too much exposition, and some of the supporting cast feels a little bit lifeless, but as the focus is almost exclusive to the two protagonists it doesn\u2019t really matter all that much. Ultimately Palm Springs is an enjoyable ride from start to finish with some excellent humor and a unique take on Groundhog Day\u2019s ideas, and although it borrows greatly from the 1993 classic, It does enough to separate itself from the other movies of the genre."
