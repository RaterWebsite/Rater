Very original film that doesn't have to rely on trends in the movie biz.  Cooper is the outright best actor for this thriller.  Rough around the edges but smooth, suave and articulate when need be.  There is a bone to pick with this movie... the end is unsettling and somewhat disappointing.  In fact, when I watch it, I literally sat there thinking, \"Really.  THIS is how they end this great movie?!?!\"  All but the ending was incredible.  9/10"

The story while being a little too familiar in science fiction was told in an original way and the cast gave good performances. I enjoyed the use of colour schemes in the movie and the dynamic use of the camera positioning and shots were interesting and effective. The movie did stay predictable throughout and unfortunately the ending of the film was not much of a surprise, something that is a little disappointing as there was more potential to this movie. Limitless is worth a watch. Recommended"

I saw this because the movie I wanted to see wasn't playing until 11, and I honestly didn't expect much from it. What I got was a visual masterpiece, with some of the best camera work I've ever seen, and an amazing story that was so much more than some guy and his magic pill. It's intense, shocking, and unique. Bradley Cooper really makes the movie. He FINALLY lets go of his super cool, good looking guy image, and really shows the audience that he can act! This movie was a breath of fresh air and I can't wait til it comes out on DVD so I can see it again!"

What will change when we can take a drug and learn quantum mechanics, everything about physiology, and understand corporate business, in a month?\r The negatives of the film do not out shadow the themes presented.\r While he should of just known to have a gun or weapon to defend himself at certain points...

A shame, since the cool starting concept went to waste.[SPOILERS] The glaring hole in plot/character is: if the drug is all-enabling, what differentiates the central character from the thug and any other person on drugs? The answer the movie gave is NOTHING. He didn't have any redeeming qualities, from start to end he was completely reliant on the drug. He may have killed someone, and showed zero remorse or guilt. Aside from running out of the drug, he really didn't run into any problems. I felt the movie had a chance when he was told \"you don't have experience, you have talent but you didn't earn it\". Unfortunately the director never went down that road. I give the movie 6, because it just doesn't live up to potential."

      "text": "Limitless is a film with a brilliant premise, with Bradley Cooper as Eddie Morrow, an intelligent but burnt out writer whose life is kind of running away from him. Tied to a deadline to produce the first chapters of a new book (after receiving an advance payment he's effectively wasted), dumped by his woman Lindy (Abbie Cornish), chased up for rent by his Chinese landlady and effectively getting to his wits end.\rSalvation comes in the unlikely form of his ex-brother-in-law Vernon (Johnny Whitworth), a low-life drug dealer who he bumps into whilst on a walk around his neighbourhood. Seemingly well to do with flash clothes and a nice apartment, he gives Eddie a clear looking pill explaining it's an experimental drug which enhances recall.\rEddie, unsure but also running out of options, heads home and takes the pill on the way. He suddenly finds himself able to access every memory in his mind, literally everything that he's ever seen, heard or been exposed to. But not only that, these memories are coherent and accessible with the necessary context, effectively making him super-intelligent. With this massive increase in intellect comes a massive increase in confidence, focus and ability to learn.\r He gets back to his apartment building and, using his new abilities, immediately beds the landlady's daughter after briefly spotting an obscure book in her bag that he remembered from his own days in college. He also recalls the background conversations between said book's owner and uses this knowledge (and his increased confidence) to dazzle the woman. He then immediately tidies his apartment, cleans all his clothes, and knocks out the chapters of his book in a few hours.\r However, things get complicated when the pill wears off. Eddie goes to see Vernon, but Vernon is shot by those he had stolen the pills from. Eddie locates the pills and begins to take one a day, using them to turn his life around.\rIn order to secure funds he borrows a substantial amount from an Eastern European loan shark, and invests in the stock exchange, becoming the darling of the financial world. He reconnects with Lindy who is shocked by the transformation and worried about the pills. And he eventually comes into contact with Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro), a billionaire tycoon who has motives of his own.\r Will Eddie come out on top? Watch the film and find out.\r But is the film any good?\r Well, yes and no. The first 45 minutes is brilliant, setting up the story and displaying the 'power' of the pills, their effect on Eddie, and the transformation of his life. The rest of the movie is like a different film, with the introduction of De Niro's character, and the shift from sci-fi/fantasy and action, into a more dramatic and slower paced, almost 'cat and mouse' thriller. To me it suffered massively because of that, and it's clear that the film is based on a novel. I can imagine the book having a lot more depth and exposition in regard to the set up, as well as a more cogent rationale for characters' actions leading to the ending.\rIt's no surprise that the television show bases its own narrative more around the action and sci-fi/fantasy elements of the first act of the movie.\rOverall the film is very good, but the complete tonal shift does mean the pace becomes almost a crawl (save for a couple of action set-pieces) after that initial 45 minutes.\r If it pops up on television, give it a whirl. But it's not a film I'd recommend anyone actively seek out."

To me, he's just a looser stealing drugs off a dead guy and cheating on his girlfriend.De Niro does his best to salvage the movie, but it's simply not possible.Also, the premise is very unbelievable. How would a former drug dealer gain access to a highly sophisticated drug, let alone walk around with a stash on him? To sum up, I didn't care very much for the movie.

      "text": "What do you get when you take an original, novel-inspired premise that has \"Limitless\" potential and injest it with Hollywood flair? A film engaging enough to make you think differently; atleast until you leave the theater. The popcorn thriller delivers, but not to the level it could have. \"Limitless\" is a film that falls into the unfortunate trap of overcomplexity. With this entrenching influence, comes gaping flaws. Before we examine such flaws, let's start with what we see on the surface. We are introduced to a charming, amiable protagonist in Cooper, who the viewer, can easily take an affinity towards. He is the vehicle for the film's effectiveness. In his role, Cooper is the \"face\" of the film's every expression, where we see and feel Morra's dissatisfaction with the status quo, and the urgency to make something of ourselves. This connection between character and self will \"do\" it for some, but that is just the start. Next is the visuals. Once we are embraced by the presence of NZT-48, the filmmakers' efforts to illustrate the endless capabilities of the drug is impressive to say the least. The world becomes bright, the scenery all makes sense, the sounds more resonant, and life's once grim lenses are now pure as ever. You throw in a couple notable supporters, (Abbie Cornish and Robert De Niro) and you have yourself a pretty enjoyable trip to the theaters, right? Perhaps, for some. This is my problem with \"Limitless.\" Once you make your way past the topical layers of the film, (cast, fast pace, visual effects) which are done tediously, there isn't any substance left, and to fill up time, the filmmakers are forced to add unneeded \"fluff\" that strays from the effectiveness of the film as in the protagonist's moral and internal struggle to weigh the consequences of power, and a desire to revert to \"normal life\" and make something of himself naturally. This is almost entirely neglected after the premise, where Hollywood's true colors are readily shown. Here is  where I begin to lose the direction of the film. Cooper's girlfriend has clearly left him in the beginning of the film, but comes back to him on a whim once he has taken the drug. Now it seems that a drug, said to allow use to use 100 % of your brain has the power to attract and give of pheremones? Interesting, yet silly.  What else is ludicrous is the seeminly unlimited supply of the drug. When Morra's ex-brother-in-law dies he finds one bag of pills, yet it seems another two or three bags are spawned over the course of the film. One of the most moronic of all plot flaws is the unnecessary involvement with the Russian loan-shark. Now, if you had the brilliance of Morra and had earned large sums of money in the stock market (which seems a bit unrealistically whimsical as well) where is the logical practicality in borrowing $100,000, and even so, when he had come out on top of the investment ($2.5 million), why would he fail to pay back the amount. The loan-shark's usage of NZT also has little to offer to the film's direction. Recalling instruction on \"how\" to fight as in the subway, also seems \"far-fetched\" when taking into account the pill's function: using all one's brain-not muscle memory. Other instances of absurdity take flight when Morra's girlfriend runs across an ice-rink (in shoes-across ice...) and picks up a child while having the strength and reaction (not traits of the drug) to lift a child up and manuever the blade of a skate flawlessly into the path of an intruder. The film's last 10-15 minutes is what really drove me over the edge of sanity. Where does drinking one's blood become a key to safety in suspense? Now granted it is unique, the logic seems suspect. Just when you thought \"Twilight\" Series couldn't be more of a pop-culture hit....Aside from the many other plot holes and moral ambiguity, \"Limitless\" is a fun roller-coaster, thriller of a ride that will make you think......only after the credits have rolled."

Let their eyes roll, you think, because on a good day, you literally feel like a god, as the words congest the previously white spaces of the page teeming with life; the life that you invented from the brain you would kiss on the cerebellum if the law of physics permitted it. But not everyday spent in Bohemia is a happy one. The prospective writer, just like Eddie Morra(Bradley Cooper), can sit at his desk and produce nothing for hours on end, abiding by the \"stay in the room\" principle to no avail, while people in the outside world with real jobs lead productive and fulfilling lives. An unsuccessful writer can suck the life out of your very being. Tired of being a \"cleaning lady\" and \"bank\", the writer's girlfriend, Lindy(Abby Cornish), indicates her preference for those punch the clock types when she dumps him, even though, you would think, an editor would have more patience than most women, since she is in the book biz. Before things can get any worse, Eddie has a fortuitous run-in with his ex-brother-in-law, Vernon(Johnny Whitworth), who gives him a special pill, a black market substance called NZT, which is designed to maximize the brain's potential, and in Eddie's case, cures his writer's block and allows him to finish the novel. \"Limitless\" should have stayed on this path, a writing path, instead of veering off into more sexy narrative terrain. With all that access to the brain's potential, Eddie could have started a new religion and be its charismatic spokesperson. \"Limitless\" could have been a treatise about the dangers of rhetoric, but the film is just not that ambitious, so it settles on being a dumb generic thriller about high financing on Wall Street, conspiracies, and who ultimately has control over the magic pills. The moviegoer doesn't care how NZT affects a Russian loan shark, since, in Vernon's words, \"it works better if you're already smart.\" Turning his back on Bohemia, Eddie becomes a financial wizard, in which \"Limitless\" then gets bogged down with deadly boring talk about corporate mergers, involving Van Loon(Robert DeNiro), who wants this newbie to restructure his deal. \"Limitless\" forgets that it had the makings of a pretty nifty science-fiction mindbender. Under NZT, large chunks of time go unaccounted for, and as a result, Eddie may or may not have murdered a socialite in a hotel room. A detective questions him, but he is never formally charged. It's as if he's getting away with murder. Since Eddie, at one point, drinks another man's blood laced with NZT, it's hard not to connect \"Limitless\" with the Christian Bale character in Mary Harron's ultra-violent \"American Psycho\", whose Patrick Bateman also gets away with murder. Both films touch on the superficial nature of society. Curiously, \"Limitless\" is quite limited in its scope. Anybody can make a killing on the market, or run for the senate. With a better script, Eddie would rule the world."

      "text": "This movie was entertaining but it falls into its own trap of being about taking a drug. It is nauseating for the viewer to watch a drug user go through highs and lows. It really is a nasty trip to go along for the ride of a user who is tripping. So, I enjoyed the highs of this movie... and I hated the lows, which should be expected... but it doesn't make it worth recommending."

      "text": "If I were rating strictly on the visuals, this film would get a 10.  I haven't seen his other films, but director Neil Burger has a good eye and uses visual effects well.  The story was interesting enough to keep my attention, but there were a couple of times I rolled my eyes in disbelief.  I was never bored, and that's a good sign.  The acting in the movie is very good and of course really comes alive when DeNiro is onscreen.  Overall, this movie intrigued me enough to want to see other films by this director because of his visual flair.  Impressive!"

The characters seem real enough to support the concept. Good performances by Bradley Cooper and Robert De niro, good touch from Abbie Cornish. Not much more to say really. It`s just not one of those movies that make you think about stuff. Sure, maybe a nice coffee talk after watching it but later, meh, it goes with all the other such productions and fades away."
