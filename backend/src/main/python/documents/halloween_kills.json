There\u2019s no plan, just people running around either being killed or trying not to be killed. None of the cast do a convincing job, and some are basically exactly the same as before. The only thing that makes you keep watching, is how creative Mike Myers gets at killing people. I really don\u2019t know how this film was allowed to be made.Come on.

You\u2019d think after over 11 movies and particularly the way the 2018 adaptation of Halloween ended that the whole franchise would have finally finished by now. Well here we are with another forgettable horror that you\u2019re far better off skipping altogether. Halloween Kills is yet another reminder that the Halloween franchise needs to stop.The seemingly never ending saga of Michael Myers and Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) continues in a downhill fashion adding yet another movie to a series that peaked in 1978 and never should have had any sequels. Despite the events that took place in the previous movie, Michael Myers has achieved superhuman status and emerges from the flames like a demonic phoenix, ready to brutally slash everyone and anyone to pieces again. But in a town that have been haunted by Myers for years the townsfolk have finally said enough to the notorious boogie man as they now take matters into their own hands, much to the dismay of the local police department who are failing to reassure everyone that they can handle this. But this ain\u2019t no normal serial killer apparently. Bullets, knives and fire cannot stop the inhuman mask wearing psychopath from returning to his home on Halloween.For those of you here for the gore, you won\u2019t be disappointed, it doesn\u2019t hold back. There\u2019s a whole bunch of disposable characters practically queuing up to be violently hacked to pieces. For those of you here for Jamie Lee Curtis I hate to disappoint you but she is criminally underused. The trailer paints a different picture of the movie\u2019s focus, I was expecting it to be Laurie and her daughter (Judy Greer). They are both underused, with the film shifting much of it\u2019s time to new characters with vague connections to the first Halloween movie. Halloween Kills really cannot help itself when it comes to reminiscing the original Halloween but all that accomplishes is you\u2019re constantly being reminded as to what a good horror looks like and not this absolute rubbish that is not worth your time or money.Halloween Kills is desperately clinging on to a classic horror with the result being a franchise that like the terrifying Michael Myers refuses to die. I love horror movies but Halloween Kills has nothing going for it, it\u2019s not scary and at times it\u2019s actually boring. Honestly it makes Halloween 2018 look like an absolute masterpiece. Not recommended for anyone. I know it\u2019s the Halloween season and the perfect time to watch a good horror movie but believe me when I say Halloween Kills isn\u2019t it, do yourself a favour and stick to the original 1978 version instead."

First he's outnumbered by a hoard of firefighters, but slaughters them one by one, each one waiting for their turn to die. Then he's outnumbered by a hoard of 20+ cocky townsfolk who beat, stab and shoot him to the ground, just to get up and kill them all in the same manner, because suddenly they're all weak scared dummies just taking it. Several times during the movie there's clear opportunities to kill him for sure, but each time they do something moronic instead; a light kick to the head instead of pitchfork in the head, a knife in the shoulder instead of knife in the head, and so on. Plot armor, because he can't die since there's a third movie. This amount of plot armor is just a sign of terrible writing. The acting is terrible, the dialogue is terrible and the entire movie is pointless and doesn't move the \"story\" forward."

      "text": "So far, this is the most disappointing movie release this year. It's like someone said...let's take Halloween but make it more like Michael Meyers is John Wick. The gore and effects are good and there's a ridiculously high kill count. But the rest of the movie is an exercise in frustration watching people make the absolute stupidest decisions and just barely put up a fight. People literally just stand there in one place for extended amounts of time and just wait to be killed. Crowds of like a dozen people all just stand there and wait their turn to die. People decide to split up into smaller and smaller groups. I can't. Then basically everyone dies...both \"legacy\" characters that all just get introduced out of nowhere only to be immediately killed and established characters from the last movie. There's a big dramatic scene where it's some commentary on \"who's the real monster\" when mob mentality is the centerpiece of this movie. *spoiler* they cause the death of a different escapee when everyone knows damn well Michael Meyers does not look like the Penguin. This movie just made me mad. The first movie had so much going for it and they messed it up hardcore and completely shifted the tone and direction. Also just like the first Halloween 2...Laurie Strode is in a hospital bed and out of commission basically the entire move, relegated to a barely there background character."

      "text": "Halloween is such a weird franchise with its constant reboots and different timelines, weird 3rd anthology movie and Busta Rhymes. Halloween (2018) was a surprisingly decent sequel/reboot and I was definitely interested in a sequel. So does this sequel live up to the 2018 version or is this another failed sequel?Firstly, it does live up to the title as Michael Myers kills A LOT of people. The kills are also quite enjoyable to watch and it is a blast to see him take down multiple individuals. Actually, Every scene featuring Michael Myers is a highlight including him stalking his prey is fun to watch. There is also a flashbacks sequence that occurs in this film that involves using a filter to make it seem like the original 1978 movie. They also used makeup instead of CGI to bring back Dr Loomis and it looks phenomenal. The scene also fixes a plot hole from the 2018 version so that was appreciated. Surprisingly, Halloween Kills explores some social commentary about mob mentality. It shows how the fear of Michael can turn people evil as well. However, the social commentary is dampened by how stupid every character is in this movie. So many characters in this movie make the stupidest decisions ever made. So many characters for some reason love splitting up instead of sticking together. The movie also shows that it is clear people can buy guns yet we will see a bunch of people try to fight Myers with baseball bats and hockey sticks. There is also one scene where a couple hears that someone is in their house but for some reason don't go outside and call the cops. One massive annoyance in this movie is that people for some reason, don't just gang up on Myers and instead come at him one at a time like complete morons. Furthermore, these people don't seem to ever try GOING FOR THE HEAD. It also baffles me that none of the characters realises where Myers is planning to go when it was extremely obvious.The story is also a complete let-down. In Halloween Kills there are two parallel plot lines, one with Myers and one with the mobs. While the mob social commentary is interesting, the plotline doesn't have any bearing on Myer's plot. It instead feels like it is taking a lot of screen time from what the audience wants. Additionally, Halloween Kills seems to change how Myer's operates compared to the previous canon films. In Halloween (2018) there was a motive that Myers is returning to finish Laurie but Halloween Kills decides to just toss that motive straight out of the window. Michael Myers also felt like a psychotic killer in the previous canon films but in Halloween Kills he must have supernatural powers because he is surviving way too many unbelievable injuries with ease and magically teleporting. He also seems to know martial arts now or something because he is doing some \"IP Man\" style kills when fighting multiple individuals. One of the big disappointments is how they handled the iconic Halloween character, Laurie Strode. Throughout the film, Laurie is just in a hospital talking and monologuing. Her scenes are so irrelevant that you could remove her character and the story will still be the same. So if Laurie is not the protagonist then who is? Well, the movie splits the screen time between Laurie's daughter Karen (Judy Greer), granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak), Tommy Doyle (Anthony Michael Hall) the child who survived in 1978, a straight couple and a gay couple. The problem is that there is not really a clear protagonist and they just split the screen time between a bunch of less interesting characters. None of them has enough screen time to develop their characters and none of them is even that likeable either.Overall, Halloween Kills is unfortunately a very bad sequel. It does provide the fun slashing kills that a fair amount of fans would want and enjoy. However, it is difficult to fully enjoy this film when there is a high amount of stupidity in it. This franchise was rebooted to remove itself from the ridiculous supernatural nature but seems to be making the same mistakes. Halloween Kills was a middle instalment that doesn't build up to anything for the final instalment. The inevitable conflict between Michael Myers and Laurie for Halloween Ends just feels less meaningful now. Hopefully, Halloween Ends somehow does better."

The plot is so bad that i wouldn't be surprised if it turned out that they'd just asked a class of six year olds to write it. The (over) acting is terrible, and Jamie Lee Curtis is hardly even in it. Then there's the really obviously ludicrous parts, like when a whole town of people mistake a little old man who stands about 5'4\" for the huge towering broad shouldered Michael Myers...apparently not only is he completely invincible in the most ludicrous way, he can also shrink several feet...at least as far as the morons in this town believe. As for the ending scene..the less said the better. This could have been a good opportunity to finally kill this awful franchise off at last. Instead you can look forward to yet another crappy movie to come.Though  This time you will know for sure that he is Supermyers and cannot be killed..which will make for an even more tedious and pointless film."

But that's just it, they aren't relevant. As far as logic goes, I get that there is a serial killer on the loose, but that doesn't mean that most of the town should be losing their god damn minds. There is like a marathon of people running through the hospital.I gave it one point for the way Myers creatively kills the victims even though the logic is still out the window. You got a guy in a mask with huge blindspots, walks 3mph, and only kills up close. Meanwhile, you have tons of people with guns that like to shoot at pointblank range."

I can\u2019t describe how a whole load of nothingness the film is. The plot non existent. Jamie the lead character has like 10 minutes screen time which was completely cringe. It\u2019s like she turned up for the quick easy money pay day as the reality kicks in that she won\u2019t land a role as big as this any more. The way the movie was shot baffled me, even Halloween resurrection was filmed better. The kills were so frustrating and they didn\u2019t even show them, they shown the final sequence of the film in a slow motion killing spree that left viewers and long term fans wondering what on earth they just watched. The lead characters and the return of a few characters from the original Halloween film seemed forced and quick. They also looked aging and tired, uninspired and lacking that touch that makes an actor today. Some scenes were completely pointless and lead nowhere. Such as the chasing of Lindsey or the chase of the mental patient. The lines were cringe worthy. \u2018Evil dies tonight\u2019. The vibe was dead. The film had no soul. The potential the film had was wasted. This would\u2019ve even been a bad television movie if it hadn\u2019t been released at cinemas. Michael Myers didn\u2019t even seem like Michael Myers.

This movie has kills left, right, up and down, and they are brutal. The acting if fine and the characters are ok, but some are not as developed as others. And there are some people in this movie that are straight up dumb, and that's ok every now and then but it does get annoying after a while. There are two issues I have with this movie. 1. Lorie Strode takes a back seat in this movie and was pretty disappointing. 2. Is there is this sub plot involving an escapee that should not have been in the movie it was very dumb. Other than those two issues everything else was great. The kills, like I said are the series best and there are a lot. And another big win is this movie's score it is thrilling and intense in all the right moments. Near the end of the movie is when everything went nuts and it was a blast. The town comes face to face with Michael and it is epic. Last but not least is the cliffhanger ending that may or may not disappoint some viewers. I liked it though. Overall 85/100"

Halloween Kills! What more can you ask for?! This is Michael at his most brutal, he wants his house back and he'll kill anyone who stands in his way. Halloween Ends comes next year so im sure you can guess somewhat what happens but I promise you, you ain't seen Michael Myers until you've seen Halloween Kills."

      "text": "Halloween Kills is not as good as its 2018 predecessor, but it is still a well done, and interesting, horror film that is worth seeing, but has some flaws. It should be stated that the ending of this film is pretty disappointing, and that is being kind. To some, the ending of Halloween Kills may ruin the whole experience of seeing the movie entirely, which is a real shame because there are some really cool things in Halloween Kills that are more worth remembering than the ending."

Fact is if I listened to critics then half of the movies that I like that they dont I wouldnt have seen. Halloween Kills is like the Empire Strikes Back in the trilogy in terms of the heroins Laurie and her daughter and granddaughter thinking they got rid of michael myers only for the killer to survive and go on a rampage of revenge. The mob mentality wanting to put a stop to the menacing force that thrives on brutality and murder. I enjoyed it and looking forward to Halloween Ends next year."

      "text": "The movie feels very cheaply made, the actors (even the well known ones) act like they only gotten a few bucks for their work and the plot is like a 10 year old wrote it.It is however very brutal and graphic. Sometimes massively over the top, very unlike Michael Myers. But it literally makes no sense. I thought cheap movies from the 70s were bad, but this is a disgrace for pretty much anything and anyone involved.It still boggles my mind how I sat through it. Maybe Im becoming desperate after so many bad movies in the last few years."

      "text": "HALLOWEEN KILLS is most certainly visceral and certainly brings the kills galore, but hides away it's one shiny spot - Laurie, the true final girl. It's bounds and leaps from the almost perfect film that came before it, and without a single focus to hold on, it's 3rd act stands on wobbly legs. At times the denizens who hunt Michael Myers through the streets of Haddonfield come off as stupid instead of brave and angry, and some of the dialogue sounds hokey, almost ridiculous. It's bloody and nihilistic and tragic, and really, not much else. Regardless of all this, HALLOWEEN KILLS stands as a solid part 2 in David Gordon Green's trilogy, that maybe lacks in some places but **** brings it in others. Excited to see how it all \"ends\"."

Felt a bit of satisfaction that my prediction for which main character would die came true, even though it came in a bit of a lame way. All in all, not bad, good horror movie."
