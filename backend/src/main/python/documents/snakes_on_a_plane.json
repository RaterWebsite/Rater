The way they jumped, struck, slithered, and I cried like a little girl the entire time with my legs on the seat curled up in a ball. Excellent movie by the way. It's weird, I loved it, but I would not buy it and would not watch it again because it was torture. I have never been so scared and so freaked out in my life and to go through that experience again would just plain hissss. I love the sleeper hits. WOW!"

      "text": "'Snakes On A Plane' ('SoaP') is without a doubt the most talked about film of the year. It all started last year when many bloggers from MySpace to YouTube began chattering about it. Yes, 'SoaP' was heard far and wide. I myself first found out about the movie whose title explains it all while coming across an article entitled, 'Samuel And Snakes'. I was oddly and instantly intrigued upon finishing it. (Despite finding out Samuel L. Jackson opted to do the film without even reading the script.) Months passed with more and more buzz generating. And by the looks of it, it didn't look as if it were going to stop anytime soon. 'SoaP' was given the title 'Best Worst Movie of the Year' by 'Wired' magazine in their January issue. New Line and TagWorld held a contest that gave artists a chance for their music to be heard in the film. And various spoof trailers were created by fans including ones with the titles, 'Teletubbies on a Plane' and 'Snakes on Claire Danes'. Within the past year 'SoaP' has been seen everywhere imaginable. You're probably wondering why I'm telling you all this since it has nothing to do with what I thought about the film though. Well I'll tell you why. 'SoaP' isn't like other films. It's something completely different. Almost an entity if you will. The buzz and media are both a part of it's ingeniousness. It can't be judged simply by normal standards solely on things like acting and visuals. There's so much more to it. Over the past two days I've read and heard people say how horrible and downright awful 'SoaP' is. Its not either of those things. The fact is those people just don't get it. I even tried to break it down into the usual categories you'd normally judge a film on. But it conflicted with how well I actually liked the film. Yes, there's some bad dialogue in a couple of the early scenes. Yes, the snakes didn't always look real. And yes, at times the movie is far more comedic than horrifying. None of this matters though. I had so much fun watching 'SoaP' I didn't care. The bottom line is 'SoaP' has a greatness that's essentially inexplicable. But not everyone is going to see that. I think Michael Phillips, reviewer for the Chicago Tribune, proves to be a prime example of the ignorance being exhibited when he says in his review, \"I liked 'Anaconda' better\". All I'll say to that is he needs a new job. Possibly a janitor in some dank office building wasting his life mopping floors, mumbling inaudible things to himself. Nevertheless, I'm not suggesting you see 'Snakes on a Plane'. I'm telling you to go see those mother******* snakes on that mother******* plane!"

The witness was suppose to fly to LA to testify against the murderer. To prevent the witness from going, the murderer puts hundreds of poisonous snakes in the cargo to kill everyone and bring the plane down. Although this plot isn't anything new to Hollywood, Snakes on a Plane features Samuel Jackson and Julianna Margulies, likable stars, and a lot of snakes on a plane. It's all we wanted."

They say and do the same things that most of us would do in that situation. They fully understand, that even thou it isn't a comedy, they are in a completely ridiculous film, not meant to be taken seriously by anyone. Samuel L. Jackson is fearless, hysterical, and terrific as FBI Agent Neville Flynn. The supporting cast, of mostly newcomers, is also great, playing off the example set by Jackson and Margulies. Lets also not forget that while many of the attack scenarios were computerized, there were still a few dozen de-fanged venomous snakes with them at all times! I don't know how you can possibly concentrate with cobras and rattlesnakes at your feet, even if they are non-venomous and used to humans. If you're looking for something simple and stupid that you don't have to think about, go for Snakes on a Plane!"

That movie wasnt meant to be taken all that seriously either and Sam Jackson made an appearance there as well. Snakes is worse action and funnier than Deep Blue. Its more in the ball park of Lake Placid which i thought was pretty funny as well. Its a good flick but besides the absurd title this movie is doing absolutely nothing that hasnt allready been done."

      "text": "Despite all the hype, this would-be exploitation/ action/ camp smash wasn't one for two very basic reasons: the plane doesn't fly and the snakes don't bite. The first 25 minutes, in which a mob kingpin, in a literal case of overkill, plots to eliminate a damaging witness by loading the plane he's traveling on with cobras, vipers and mambas (and we learn that joining the Mile-High Club can be hazardous to your health) are promising, and it's impossible to completely dismiss an airplane-calamity movie that includes a parody of Legally Blonde's Elle Woods on its passenger list. Ultimately, however, director David R. Ellis (a solid B-movie craftsman who's done far better work with Final Destination 2 and Cellular) can't sustain the balance between gore and satire that Roger Corman, Paul Bartel, Joe Dante and other New World Pictures writers and directors accomplished so effortlessly in such classic 1970s drive-in fare as Death Race 2000 and Piranha. Speaking of the 1970s, part of the problem is this movie's slavish adherence to the blueprints of another of that decade's most notorious genres: you don't have to be afflicted with disaster movie deja vu to know instinctively which of the plane's passengers are either too loathsome or too lovable to live, or that children will be threatened but not totally turned into snake kibble, and that at least one of the three major characters will be involved in at least one false alarm. Worse still, Snakes on a Plane ultimately becomes stagy, contrived and dull because of the behavior of the snakes themselves: due to certain plot contrivances they go on sporadic feeding frenzies and then disappear entirely from the movie for long stretches of time. (What were they doing, reading the in-flight magazine? If so, that explains it--they all fell asleep!) Even though we all know that this movie has about as much chance of actually being shown on a plane as United 93, the airlines might want to reconsider: with all the recent controversy over the latest tightening of security regulations, Snakes on a Plane DOES present the very convincing argument that in the event of on-board snake attacks, too much carry-on luggage will definitely hamper your getaway. And you certainly can't fault Samuel L. Jackson's energetic performance as an FBI agent: not since Jane Fonda in last year's Monster-in-Law has an actor so thoroughly redeemed a completely shallow, one-dimensional part by displaying so much joy in the playing of it. His delivery of the line about being tired of those m***********g snakes on the m***********g plane is already the stuff of legend; it's easy to understand why audiences, seeing through the malarkey and recognizing this mediocrity for what it is, grew equally (and very quickly) tired of seeing these m***********g snakes in their m***********g theaters, too."

The movie itself was one of absurdness, both on the story and acting front (for the most part), but it knew as much and therefore was able to pull it off with great success. And while it started off a bit slow and lame story wise, the first few snake bite attacks were so over-the-top, you had to wonder how they could possibly continue the insanity - yet somehow they managed. The movie stayed entertaining from beginning to end, though the middle section was probably the best part of the film.
