      "text": "Nightcrawler is a modern achievement.\r Jake Gyllenhaal plays a sociopath bent on success, and he won't let anything or anyone stand in his way. Gyllenhaal is really hitting his stride this year, complete with this movie, Enemy, and Prisoners. I personally think this is his best role yet. He is utterly disturbing at one point, hilarious at another, and horrifying at others. I spent the entire movie wondering if he could top the insanity of the last line he said, and he always did.\r The cinematography is beautiful and the editing is crisp and fast. Do not think this is an action movie, it is very much a thriller. However, one scene in the movie has some of the best editing and shots I've seen in an action scene in the past few years.\r Story is interesting and lets you dive into the intricacies of crime reporting in Los Angeles. There were some very minor things I would change to let the movie feel more sturdy near the end, but it felt complete.\r This is a movie you have to see. Gyllenhaal should be guaranteed an Oscar Nomination."

      "text": "Lou Bloom: \"Steady hands, steady hands\".\r The story is about a young man, desperate for work, stumbles upon the seedy underworld of L.A.'s crime journalism. The break-neck pace is all about being the first on the scene - murder, accidents, fires, mayhem - and selling the gratuitous footage to the local news stations. But the better he gets, the more likely he is going to become the next story.\r I heard so many great things about Nightcrawler. The critics said the same like, \"It's a flawless peace of entertainment\" or \"One of the best movie of the year\".- So I was looking forward to the movie by hearing all the good buzz from it, and after seeing it I can say that this movie is flawless.\r Jake Gyllenhaal gives one of his best performance he ever did in his career. He lost a lot of weight for this role and I can say it pays off so well. I love how he makes his character so creepy, but so interesting to watch on screen. I swear to god if he doesn't get a Oscar nomination for his performance in this movie, I will be angry and disappointed at the Oscars, because when I watch a movie and don't see the actor, just the character that right they is talent.\r The director of this movie (Dan Gilroy) and he was only a screenwriter for most of his career and this movie is his first time directing and my god his he brilliant. Dan Gilroy but a lot of effort in this movie and I heard that the director of the movie actually met some people who do these things that people call \"Nightcrawling\", and to me that shows that this guy should make more films in future, because he's the kind of director that movie need.\r The writing in this movie is some of the best writing I've seen since Boyhood, I mean every sentence in this movie glues me in it's story and character's. The move itself has that dark, uneasy and hash look to it, but that's life. The shots were good, the other cast member's were great as well.\r But as I said in my Interstellar and The Guest review, the movie isn't going to get the perfect rating of five out of five star's, but the movie is still brilliant."

And unlike most films/shows slamming the \"if it bleeds, it leads\" mantra, this film avoids preaching. Rene Russo is totally believable as the TV producer past the point of prettiness and fighting to stay relevant. But I really wanted a little bit of insight into the lead character's behavior ... the logistics of his previous survival, not to mention the roots of his sociopathic behavior."

      "text": "Suspension of disbelief should be an advisory caution when viewing 'Nightcrawler'. However, as long as one can over look the story's obvious absurdities it can be enjoyed as a compelling and superior thriller.\rJake Gyllenhaal is superb as the not unlikeable nutter who opportunistically decides to make a living by filming the misfortunes, injuries and death throes of others, which he then sells to TV. His total disdain for people and human life sets no bounds and this, in turn, leads him to TV news producer Renee Russo. She is fantastic as an ageing last chance producer who becomes entangled in his web. The scenes between them both literally crackle with there own kind of tension and are excellently written.\rThe movie, mainly shot at night, makes excellent use of its L. A. locations, and a couple of set pieces (a home invasion and a restaurant shoot out) are outstanding and demonstrate first rate examples of how to create sustained tension. Flying under the radar, this is a film not to be missed."

      "text": "In 2012, Aaron Sorkin piloted a television program that educated, informed and entertained by nit-picking the issues of modern day television broadcasting, information distribution and most of all, societal perception. Luckily, I was able to stumble upon a clip of the opening monologue of the show via YouTube, which was recommendation by a friend. The monologue, delivered by Will McAvoy, played by the audacious Jeff Daniels, is single handedly, one of the greatest monologues in television history, describing the issues with contemporary American politics, government, its people and most of all, the media. Approaching its third (and final) season, The Newsroom has proved to be a champion of debunking the public\u2019s predictive perspective of hyped up terror scares, exploitation news broadcasting and television, as well as ginned up controversy.\r With Nightcrawler, writer/director Dan Gilroy feature film debut, the film delivers an almost complete counter-program to one of the best shows on television today, glorifying the exact same things The Newsroom is championing against. Yet, from the first dark scenes of trespassing to the final scenes of pure brutality and unimaginable corruption, Nightcrawler crawls up your skin and into our heads as one of the creepiest and feverishly uncomfortable films of 2014.\r Nightcrawler begins like any nightmare would, at night. Basked in the sketchy noir lights of an almost unrecognizable Los Angeles, similar to Newton Thomas Sigel\u2019s Los Angles in Refn\u2019s Drive, the night city is consumed by insomniacs and blood-thrity reporters looking to make money and a name for themselves based on the misfortunes and tragedies of others.\r One of those inhabitants is Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal), a fast-talking, quick learning creepy night-dweller who takes most of his knowledge and facts from the internet and disposes of his verbal jargon to anyone who crosses his path for his own interests. We first meet the Lou as a petty thief who cuts fences and steals manholes to make his money and earn a living. Bloom is a sociopath, and although we don\u2019t immediately connect with the character, never once asking the questions of how, why and for how long he has been living this life, we never really question him either.\r After successfully trading his stolen possession to a local scrap metal owner, where he unsuccessfully bargains the terms of an employment position, Lou drives onto the barren freeway in his dilapidated car, stumbling across a car on fire. After pulling over and being mesmerized by the deadly ambers igniting on the hood on the destroyed vehicle, two news photographers crash the scenes with their nightly lit cameras and gear. Like we\u2019ve seen before, Lou is no stranger to awkwardness, since he is as much an opportunist as he is a slimy insomniac, he offers his services to the \u2018nightcrawler photographer\u2019 Joe Loder (Bill Paxton). Rejected, Lou still feels that he has finally found his calling and with that, he steals an impressive racing bike on the Venice beach boardwalk in order to pay for a dodgy camcorder and cheap police scanner in order to begin his adventures as an amateurish nightcrawler.\r The film\u2019s success can easily be accountable to its transformative star Jake Gyllenhaal, who lost over twenty pounds for the role by biking and running to set and reportedly spending up to eight hours a day at the gym. The actor, who has been nothing but superb in a recent string of stirring films from Prisoners, Enemy, End of Watch and Source Code, delivers one of his finest and easily most haunting performances to date. Complete with bulging eyes, an Adam\u2019s apple and veins coursing the entirety of his body, Gyllenhaal proves that the simplest aesthetics are the scariest. Having no regard for human beings and enticing strangers with a jabber that is almost to quick to comprehend, Gyllenhaal\u2019s dedication to the sketchy Bloom is seen both physically and emotionally, as well and felt cold-heartedly and abruptly by its audience.\r Bloom strives off hard work as he proves, despite his better concern for the law, he is a hustler. Convincing himself as well as everyone around him his potential in an industry that strives off trespassing, seduction and lies, Bloom manipulates everyone for his own regard. Reciting over the same lines, whether it be to a new employee of his company during a job interview to a desperate and homeless Rick (Riz Ahmed), or convincing low-rating news director Nina Romina (Rene Russo) of his potential of delivering graphic, unsavoury and somewhat illegal images for her morning broadcasts, Bloom believes that \u201cIf you want to win the lottery, you have to make the money to buy a ticket\u201d, by any means possible. With-holding information to the police and pulling on the weaknesses of his prey, Bloom never thinks a second, making him one of the scariest, real people we never want to have the pleasure of meeting."

      "text": "Two intoxicated old newsmen, a producer and the anchorman he just fired, in Network, nurse their last drinks at the bar, commiserating over the slipping standards of broadcast journalism. As a riposte to Howard Beale's avowal of an on-air suicide, in jest, the UBS news division head envisions The Death Hour, a weekly series whose content is wholly violent, wholly sensational. \"Suicides, assassinations, automobile smashups,\" Max jokingly brainstorms, never dreaming that his drunken ramblings outlining a telecast of blood-soaked spectacle would one day turn out to be an uncanny bit of prophetic extrapolation, a bar-lowering that allows somebody like Louis Bloom, a freelancing videographer, to be an invaluable media cog. Louis' bosses are death merchants, ratings-driven professionals who fulfill the UBS producer's longago pitch for a \"great Sunday night show for the whole family.\" Nightcrawler can be seen as the third film in an unofficial trilogy about the dumbing down of the news, the unassailable culmination of Beale's rant to the studio audience that television had supplanted books and newspapers as the primary medium of intellectual discourse. The penultimate film, Broadcast News, released a decade after Network, screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky's divination that entertainment value would eventually encroach on the erudite nature of hard news proved to be true, finds encapsulation in the scene where Jane Craig, a Washington bureau producer, sounds the alarm on broadcast news content when she presents a domino demonstration clip at a conference for local reporters. Whereas, in Network, the studio audience watching a degraded version of the news was the hoi polloi, denizens raised on Bugs Bunny, therefore rankling the old vanguard who still controlled the medium, in Broadcast News, we can see, quite pointedly, how the generation gap closed during the interim between both films. The Bugs Bunny aficionados were now the gatekeepers, industry insiders, who, to Jane's disappointment, are not \"mad as hell\" about the infiltration of fluff bombarding the airwaves, when the seminar attendees clap in approval after the final domino falls. At this juncture, the late-eighties, it would seem by the light-hearted genre(the rom-com) that is chosen to document the news program's fluid aspect in filmic amber, networks and their affiliates were, as of yet, not the whorehouses that Frank Hackett had purported UBS to be. Broadcast News ends on an optimistic note, a note suggesting that the trend could still be reversed. Tom Grunick, newly minted as the face of the news division, at his press conference, defers the programming duties to a civic-minded heavyweight. This conceit, in which a narcissist like the telegenic, yet uninformed newsman would be an advocate for hard copy that matters, now, in retrospect, seems more absurd than an anchorman being assassinated by network honchos because of low ratings. Tom is all about style over substance. Jane Craig doesn't exist anymore. Diana Christensen does. Once thought to be an implausible invention of a scribe with an overheated imagination, the bloodthirsty woman behind The Mao Tse Tung Hour, the UBS hit show documenting the terroristic maneuvers of the Ecumenical Liberation Army, lives on in Nina Romina, the news editor for a low-rated L.A. morning show, who embodies and widens Diana's vision of broadcast news as spectacle. Chayefsky, who would die in '81, never lived to see the ultra-violent direction that Hollywood would take; he never saw the big-budgeted studio films with high body counts, the count so high, audiences would become desensitized to the human collateral damage. In Bad Boys 2, neither we nor the filmmaker, in a chase scene between off-road vehicles, stop to consider the welfare of the Haitian peasants as the Hummer and Range Rover plow through their tarpaper shanties. Nightcrawler satirizes a different generation, The Terminator Generation, raised on the \"event movie\". Better than Man Bites Dog, the psuedo-doc about a film crew who follows a serial killer at work, Nightcrawler gets its message across about audience complicity towards violence because unlike the grainy B/W, cinema verite style of the Belgian import, the filmmaker uses the film language of the Hollywood blockbuster. Situated outside a glass-walled Chinese restaurant, Louis records a furious exchange of gunfire between the police and the suspects of a home invasion. The rectangular glass front, meant to represent a movie screen, provides a clue as to why people tune into the graphic imagery that apparently turns up on local mornings news shows in big cities. It's entertainment. It's The Death Hour. When Ben, in Man Bites Dog, murders an entire family in their home, we're horrified because it looks real. Here, violence, looks fun behind Louis' camera eye. Innocent bystanders die in the shootout, but we don't care. We've seen it in the movies."

There's always a movie about what it takes, and what is \"takes\", to make it big, but writer/director Dan Gilroy implies something a bit different here. That maybe what it takes is to be sociopath, have no principles, moral or empathy and that maybe it rubs off a bit, because it is seductive and it is EVERYTHING and that's how it spreads.\r Jake Gyllenhaal likened his character to a coyote and it really shows. Eye sockets dark and retreated, a lanking hunched over posture and an instinct for survival. No matter the cost. Also a great satire of TV news (spot-on, obvious, perfect). A character study, modern reflection, satire; single-minded and balanced."

I was just immersed. But really, it's all about quality over quantity so I can't really complain. I just really hope they make a sequel to this, I can't wait to see what happens next."

Jake Gyllenhaal's has one of his finest performances as the unwavering, sociopathic Leo Bloom, who is determined to climb to success, willing to do anything, regardless of the ethical, moral, or legal questions they may bring up. The script explores a whole new lens of how crime operates; not those ones who solve crimes, but those who broadcast it to us.

      "text": "\u201cNightcrawler\" is an intense and riveting thriller, with a neo-noir style and and some dark social commentary of today's news media. Death and destruction becomes headlines, \"each police siren wail equals a possible windfall, and victims\" are merely \"dollars and cents\" in the film \"Nightcrawler\".\r Lou Bloom is a hard-working man, a perfectionist, a fast-learner with a can-do attitude and an uncompromising work ethic. He's quite eloquent, articulate, and knowledgeable. He sounds like a nice guy, right? However, some people just don't know when to stop--when things have gone too far, out of hand, or crossed a line. Lou Bloom is one of those people. From tampering with crime scenes, to pressuring a co-worker for sex, to blackmailing and sabotaging others, to withholding information from authorities, to manipulating events to his advantage, Lou is an example of an opportunist who never stops pushing. He \"blurs the line between observer and participant\". Lou pursues the American Dream like countless other US citizens/residents--but he's simply willing to do anything to get his payday.\r The movie shows just how screwed up media can be. It\u2019s competitive and ugly, with people fighting over the most gruesome footage. Nina primarily represents the ugly objectives of a cutthroat industry.***MILD SPOILERS*** When Nina discovers that a home invasion massacre was a drug deal gone wrong, she decides not to release that info (as it doesn\u2019t go with the fear-instilling message she\u2019s trying to tell). Nina also tells Lou to focus primarily on getting footage from wealthy, white neighborhoods, because that\u2019s what the people want.\r Jake Gyllenhaal does an excellent performance as Lou. He's convincing as the socially awkward, demanding, and unsettling man. Jake shows effort, and he even lost weight for the role (which is evident with his gaunt cheekbones). Renne Russo is also great as Nina, a woman who also has little moral qualms with the faults of her work. Riz Ahmed's supporting character (Rick) could've had more of a backstory. I also happened to like Bill Paxton in his small role (as Joe, rival cameraman to Jake\u2019s character Lou). Dan Gilroy does a great job as director, especially considering Nightcrawler is his first movie.\r Despite this praise, because Lou is presented as such a sociopath from the beginning, the movie has slightly less suspense toward the end than it could've had (in hindsight). However, the tragedy at the end is still unexpected to me.\r I have reviewed 38 other movies on Metacritic and IMDB, including the 2014 and 2015 films: Taken 3, The Interview, Exodus: Gods and Kings, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1, Dracula Untold, The Maze Runner, The Equalizer, The Expendables 3, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Guardians of the Galaxy, The Giver, Sharknado 2, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Transformers: Age of Extinction, Edge of Tomorrow, X-Men Days of Future Past, Godzilla, Blended, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Divergent, Transcendence, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, The Lego Movie, and more.\r I review TV shows, such as: Empire (2015), The Flash, Arrow (Season 3), Gotham, The Last Ship (Season 1), Sleepy Hollow  (Season 1), Marvel's Agents of SHIELD (Season 1 and 2), The 100, I Wanna Marry Harry, Crisis, Gang Related, and more.

He likes to talk and he frequently tries to convince people that he\u2019s a successful business man, a mover and shaker, who\u2019s moving up in the world.  But, he\u2019s more than unconvincing, and when he talks people look at him as though he were Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man.  He\u2019s a mimic, without a moral compass.  He tries to parrot the words and actions of those around him, and he\u2019s a quick learner.  Rene Russo plays an aging TV news director working the night shift at the lowest rated TV station in LA.  Gyllenhall learns that she will pay cash money for video footage of car crashes and other dirty laundry, if he can get it to her first.  Bill Paxton is Gyllenhalls\u2019 competition.

He will let nothing stand in his sociopathic way to become the best of what he does. He believes he can deceive and manipulate anything as long as he's good at it, and he strives to become best to have something of his own. His humanity is certainly questionable but it delivers the fact of what loneliness can do to people. He is alone (and perhaps wants to be) but whats recognition that only he himself can see he deserves. The film plays out brilliantly and is paced greatly until somewhere in the second half that i can't state exactly where, but once the \"road accident\" and \"set up\" takes place the film picks back up for a climactic, fast paced and faultless finale!

He said in a recent interview in regards to the film \"I don't think this experience will every completely go away\" and I would be surprised if it left him that easily. Gyllenhaal builds an extremely complex character, reminiscent of Heath Ledger's portrayal of The Joker in \"The Dark Knight\" in some ways. This performance is one of the best of the year and his character should be viewed as one of those that I am lucky enough to have seen on the big screen. Like Gylllenhaal I don't think that, for me, \"this experience will every go away.\"\r What I also found of interest was how the film made an insightful comment in regards to what today's media has become. This is something that I don't think the average viewer picks up, understanding that the media is this film is twisted looking to make money without principle nor wanting to inform people, the purpose of news (or rather what it should be...) \"Lou\" is this twisted monster, a personification of today's media. What I did notice was how Kevin Rahm (playing Frank Kruse) acts as the opposite this, standing up for these traditional principals and what news should be. The film does well to make this comment, something that I think most films should try to do, and it hits a fine line in regards to it, something that I think \"The Imitation Game\" didn't do in regards to homophobia and completely missed the boat on in regards to women rights (see my review on it).\r What I can criticise, and its worth noting I only do so because there always has to be some criticism with any film, in regards to \"Nightcrawler\" is how I found Riz Ahmed's inclusion (playing Rick) a bit unnecessary, the same with the film's ending. I find this in most films and I can never put a finger on it but in some ways I sympathised with the bastards next to me whispering \"why hasn't this film ended yet?\"  Its finally worth noting that Dan Gilroy makes his directorial debut with \"Nightcrawler\" and that explains some of the films flaws, but I'm not going to criticise him. I mean it his debut, and a bloody good one at that.\r \"Nightcrawler\" is a fantastic film and for me, Jack Glyenhaal was the highlight. 100% deserved of an Oscar Nomination, perhaps a win. What \"Nightcrawler\" made me realise though was how **** up our media is."

After multiple rejections, Bloom, a keen observer, becomes involved by chance in the dark world of L.A. night crime \u201cjournalism\u201d and discovers not only that he is fascinated by this sheer cirque du freak a.k.a. media, but also that he is very good at catching glimpses of human decadence and moral decay.\r Persistent and insidious by nature, Bloom crawls under the skin of an ethically challenged TV producer, Nina, played by Rene Russo, desperate to prove herself on top of her game. Their professional relationship quickly turns from a win-win situation into a personal and intimate (although the viewer never gets a direct proof in this respect, but only a couple of visual hints) power struggle, easily won by a scheming Bloom. And this is where Gilroy shows his masterful directing eye through clean cut close-ups and narrow camera angles that manage to catch the characters\u2019 body language and facial expressions: a sneaky reptilian Bloom and an arrogant feline like Nina \u2013 both creatures of the night.\r Bloom is not at all a sociopath as he might come across at a first glance. He is just a striver, an over-achiever who lacks any kind of conscience or feelings and is willing to literary step on dead bodies and who is not so different from any climber on the corporate or social ladder. He\u2019s manipulative and a very good salesman, not bound by any moral constraints and thus, anyone who comes into contact with him becomes an instant prey. Bloom is a by-product of today\u2019s society that tries to spit him out at first, only to become his playground later, and to a certain extent he is the embodiment of the American dream.\r \u201cNightcrawler\u201d is an obvious satire, but it never preaches or moralizes. It observes through a lens and lets the viewer grasp whatever he will out of this contorted monster.\r Gilroy knows how to build up tension and keep up the suspense by alternating quiet wide shots with fast paced action scenes. His directorial debut is reminiscent of Nicolas Winding Refn\u2019s \u201cDrive\u201d and \u201cOnly God Forgives\u201d, a sort of a \u201cneon cinema\u201d product that casts a spell on the viewer through its raw lawlessness and haunting soundtrack. But unlike Ryan Gosling in \u201cDrive\u201d, Gilroy\u2019s Bloom is an anti-hero that you loathe from the first frame (maybe except for the few times when you see him carefully wetting the only sign of life in his shadowy spartan apartment \u2013 a plant). Jake Gyllenhaal is annoyingly fascinating in his creation of Bloom and the movie\u2019s brilliance is largely due to his Oscar worthy performance. With wide bulging eyes and a head that seems almost too big for his skinny and slightly gibbous frame, Gyllenhaal shows how much he immersed himself into the creepy crawling Bloom. Gyllenhaal seems poised to win his first Oscar nomination for a lead role with \u201cNightcrawler\u201d, but even if that doesn\u2019t happen he sure managed to hone one of the most despicable yet memorable cinematic anti-heroes in recent years.\r \u201cNightcrawler\u201d is a must-seen, definitely worth the ticket money and your attention, especially for the haunting intensity of Gyllenhaal\u2019s performance."

At first the Story seamed pretty boring, but it isn't what the Story is, its more about how the the character reacts in Moments that can make or break a carrier. The focus lies in Louis Bloom, there is one word to describe him \"Sociopath\". The friendliness he has showed through out the Movie is learned. Everybody can see that trough the fantastic acting from Jake Gyllenhaal. Louis Bloom Is shown to have money problems so we the audience can emphasize with him. But longer the Movie goes on the more we see that Louis Bloom isn't only the Protagonist he is also the Antagonist. The does thing what are Morally wrong just for the sake that he can get more successful. His decisions pushes the story along, this is what makes the Movie so great because your asking yourself whats gonna happen next."

It's appropriately seedy and eerie; Jake Gyllenhaal gives one of his best performances of his career; and the tone is dead-on accurate in every scene no matter what s happening. The characters are all round and realistic, and the cinematography to die for. If these things don't do it for you, it'll be the pure atmospheric tension of the movie that keeps it going along, scene by scene, building up for a climactic final third. This is one of the best films of the year."

Nightcrawler is a character study, a look into the mind of an already established psychopath as he delves deeper and deeper to the point of no return. You follow Lou Bloom, a man who goes from one payout to the next in a variety of illegal ways, until one night he discovers he has an unmatched talent for Nichtcrawling, which is the filming of crime scenes and violent acts for the seedy underworld of the late night news. Bloom becomes so obsessed with capturing the best possible crime on camera and goes to unspeakable lengths to achieve his goal.\rGyllenhaal gives the performance of his life as the creepy yet totally gripping lou Bloom, with his wide eyes that never blink and stilted conversations that sound as if he's gone onto the web and looked up 'How to talk to people'. The whole movie essentially follows his journey up the ladder of the Nightcrawling profession, in fact I don't think there's a single scene in the film which he doesn't appear in, as the other cast members really do play supporting roles for the main even that is Bloom. The action sequences are done immaculately, with the last 20 minutes of the movie proving to be the tensest I've seen in a long time.\rI can't think of a serious issue I have with this movie. The acting from Gyllenhaal is Oscar worthy, the storyline is unpredictable and tense and even the directing, whilst not perfect, really portrays LA night-life superbly. My favourite film of 2014 and a must see for everyone else."

The plot flows in a perfect rhythm through the head of a messed up guy Louis Bloom, who takes you on a high speed ride behind an exquisite red muscle to shoot stories up close.\r Jake Gyllenhaal is hands down one of the finest actors in Hollywood. The heights he scales and the lengths he drives deserve a big fat ovation. A psychopath on the loose, Jake is something more than that, a perfectionist who does things that he is good at. A deft thief whose keen eyes fall on crime journalism. He crosses all human confinements and legal barriers to get stories that are still hatching. Every crime scene is his puppet. He beats even the police to it.\r An equally good performance by co-stars Rene Russo and Riz Ahmed who end up being manipulated by the devilry of the badass diligent Nightcrawler. Sitting on the hood of the car listening to every word that the static says, learning everything about police radio codes, manifest how dedicated the protagonist is to his work. In his words: \"I am a quick learner.\"\r There are shots that Jake perfects without dropping his calm demeanor, unhindered and incessant speeches that make you want to clap for his effort. The screenplay brings magic through his lips. The time he breaks the mirror screaming with frustration shows the perfection he has achieved in his acting. A great actor, with the variegation he has scoured, makes him one of a kind. I place him amongst the greats. Bravo!"

Nightcrawler is all about the characters, everyone delivers amazing performances with dialogue that felt real. You can sort of tell where the movie is going, but it takes a slight turn, and goes into a different direction you werent expecting, and keeps you on the edge of your seat for the whole runtime of the movie. It is also visually sleek, great job by this movie's director and cinematographer. My only problem with the movie is, at least for me, the ending was a bit anti-climatic, and I was expecting something more out of the ending. That being said, Nightcrawler is a  great thriller, and one of the best movies of the year, who knows, maybe in a couple of years this movie will be considered the new American Psycho."

He's utterly convincing.  I felt a sort of weird pity for him at first, but this was all washed away once it became clear just how twisted the character really was.  Nightcrawler is a very exciting movie, full of intense action scenes.  It's also a very stylish looking film.  It uses neon and shadows in much of the way Drive did, but not quite to that movie's vibrant extant.  There are some surprising turns, the story is involving, and the satire is sharp, but I also felt that in the end it didn't have enough weight to it.  It's memorable, but something about it is fairly distant, and unattainable.  You'd never guess that it's a small budget indie film though.  It has all the polish of a major Hollywood blockbuster.  I wouldn't be shocked if it ended up with a couple Oscar nominations, even in some of the major categories."

As someone suggested at dinner afterwards, he may be a sociopath like Charles Manson or Hannibal Lecter, but at least Hannibal Lecter had a sense of humor and so some self-knowledge. Jake Gyllenhaal gives an Oscar-worthy performance and is always in character and completely convincing. The analogy to Manson may be apt since Manson supposedly (and ironically) got his start in manipulation by reading Dale Carnegie\u2019s classic  book \u201cHow to Win Friends and Influence People.\u201d Bloom has taken business courses online and learned only to be ruthless. He also reminded me of Bartleby the Scrivener in that his own desires and will came before anyone else\u2019s. Nightcrawler is a fascinating film, and I wasn\u2019t bored for a second, watching the diabolical Bloom become a \"success\" in the amoral world of sensational broadcast journalism where ratings are the only thing that count \u2013 a world worthy of Bloom\u2019s cold and clinical view of life."

      "text": "NIGHTCRAWLER \u2013 JUST WOW \u2013 WHAT A MOVIE. Jake Gyllenhaal is my pick for Best Male Actor Oscar this year and the movie deserves a nomination, as does first time director, Dan Gilroy. In the words of Lou Bloom \u201cA friend is a gift you give yourself\u201d \u2013 this movie is your friend!\r Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a loner, a dedicated and passionately driven loner. He has absolutely no friends and spends his time by himself, learning a vast amount of skills on the internet or stealing items to sell. He desperately wants love (or his idea of love) and a job with a steady income. His social skills are based on what he has learned online, as such, he has no social graces or knowledge. He speaks like a text book and is void of emotion and a path to live on. He tries asking for jobs and selling himself to various places but he has no luck, until he sees a fascinating and bloody piece of inspiration. He could become someone who works for himself and gets a reward if he does the job well, that of a nightcrawler, overnight freelance trash journalism. The stuff that trash TV news wants a piece of, the darkest of society at its worse. You all love seeing a train wreck, you know you shouldn\u2019t watch but you can\u2019t take your eyes off it. Lou films it and sells it to TV for you to watch over your morning breakfast. But as a freelancing job there are other freelancers and if you want your item sold you need to have the best footage, what would you, or in this case, Lou do to get the best sellable footage?\r Lou is a vampire, a manipulative murderous vampire, he is terrifying in his matter of fact speak, unpredictable and unstoppable, could it turn into a serial killer movie? Lou is another train wreck you can\u2019t take your eyes off, while his delivery is humorous his belief in himself and the world is beyond freakish, the worst part, people like him probably exist.\r Lou meets KLWA night news editor, ruthless, trash TV editor, Nina Romina (Rene Russo), who he sells his footage to exclusively. Romina is at the end of her career tether and knows that train wrecks will sell and get people viewing. In Nina Romina\u2019s own words describing the ideal footage \u201ca screaming woman, running down the street with her throat cut,\u201d she says, and Lou is willing to go the extra distance to get it for her. It\u2019s a match made in television hell.\r At the start Nina views Lou as a simple determined guy, the new kid on the block who may have some good footage. But their relationship grows into much more.\r Russo\u2019s husband, writer/ director Dan Gilroy has delivered a fresh and nuanced screenplay and delivered it on a golden platter with his debut movie. The unintentional wit and candour of Lou is reminiscent of Norman Bates and Frank. Gyllenhaal provides a dedicated tour de force with his performance. He was so dedicated to the role, he worked out eight hours a day and rode his cycle to set to lose weight as he wanted to be a \u201chungry coyote,\u201d he also was so involved in the \u201cmirror\u201d scene he ended up in hospital getting his hand stitched, he then came straight back to set.\r The supporting cast of Rene Russo, Riz Ahmed and Bill Paxton is the icing on the cake for this movie, they were all perfectly cast and perfectly delivered their characters. All of these characters have a small but pivotal piece on Lou\u2019s chessboard and it all comes through onscreen, there is never too much nor too little delivered. That being said I always want more Paxton onscreen, he plays such a great character in this, he could have his own movie. And Russo is still one woman I would turn for, ever since LETHAL WEAPON 3 I have crushed on her, I never thought she could do a trashy and desperate look, an aging and needy power woman, and she does, while slowly falling into Lou\u2019s world of insanity.\r Academy Award Winner Robert Elswit\u2019s cinemtography is the cherry on top of that icing on this glorious cake of a movie. It has a definite Scorcese look and feel to it. The seedy undertones and dark moodiness of Los Angeles created by Elswit have never felt so unappealing, it literally is a hunting ground for Lou. At the same time the colours are all striking, to match the increased sight by Lou's large \"all-seeing\" eyes, eyes that Gyllenhaal rarely blinks - he did the same thing in DONNIE DARKO.\r NIGHTCRAWLERS' satirical dark comedic thrilling look at paparazzi styled freelance guerrilla journalism is at times hilarious and at others terrifying. This is the closest film to Scorcese's BRINGING OUT THE DEAD I have seen. It is an amazing piece of cinema for film lovers, this is not for the family or date night. Gyllenhall for Oscar!"
