But it seems to me like he wants to take a page out of Liam Neeson's \"Taken\" scoresheet on becoming the bad ass that he is today. 3 Days to Kill is like Blown Away ripped off by Die Hard as to joining a member of the AARP special agents club. The acting is great, but the story is boring and not enough gas in the tank for McG (you know, the guy 5 years ago killed the Terminator series into oblivion in Salvation) and Besson to copy what's left of \"Taken.\" But on the good side, the action scenes were pretty good. So I'm not so sure about this film, but I'll have to wait for \"Non-Stop\" instead. Rent \"3 Days To Kill.\""

      "text": "3 Days To Kill was promoted in a very misleading way. The previews, the description, even the cover of the DVD make it sound like an exciting thriller. They even manipulated the name of the film, to make it seem like one thing, when it really meant another. The story centers around Ethan Renner, (Kevin Costner) a man who has spent his entire life killing people for the CIA. Renner has found that he only has a short time to live and wants to spend his remaining time with the family he's largely abandoned. His retirement is short lived however, as his old bosses at the CIA promise to help with his medical care if he'll do one last job, a job he doesn't want his family to know about. 3 Days To Kill was made to look like the dying agent had 3 Days To Kill his target, but that's not true at all. The title refers to him spending 3 days with the daughter he hasn't seen in 10 years. Like everyone else, I was fooled by the films promotion and decided to see it, even though Kevin Costner stars. I forgot the fact that Costner hasn't made a decent film in about fifteen years, and assumed that 3 Days To Kill would lead him away from romantic films and be a return to what made him a star, but it wasn't. The action and intensity of a CIA thriller is a back story, to a film about a dying man reconnecting with his family. It wasn't as boring or depressing as a full on drama, following a similar storyline, but it wasn't far off. Much of the hunt for his target was used as comedy to break up the monotony of watching Renner teaching his daughter to dance and ride a bicycle. To be honest, the film really is just a whole mix of things, none of which work. The cast is dreadful, the story is all over the place, and the film is just ridiculous. 3 Days To Kill was a horrible experience, and not only did I hate this film, I feel like I was tricked into watching it, by some clever marketing people, who knew the film was **** You can decide for yourself, but if you could use an extra two hours to do something you've been putting off, I'd skip this movie and get it done."

It's extremely far from perfect, but it has elements I loved that I will talk about in the review. When you first see this movie at the RedBox (which is where I got it), you probably will think it's an action movie. That would be wrong. While it does have scenes of action, at the core of the movie, it is a drama that deals with family, getting the job done, and other subjects like that. I'm glad that it was a drama because the action didn't impress me much except for the first scene. The character development in the drama is extremely good, and while the acting isn't extraordinary, I really liked Ethan's (Kevin Costner) daughter as an actress. You will care about the characters, too. There are mainly 2 plot points in the film, one for the action, and one for the drama. The action one has to do with him pretty much just trying to kill or torture these men he has to hunt down. It was generic. The drama one was refreshing for this genre, though. It has to do with him becoming a dad again and regaining the love from his daughter. Everything in this film is nothing groundbreaking or extremely ambitious. For what it was though, I really enjoyed it, and the drama in it is worth a watch indeed."

      "text": "\"3 Days to Kill\" 10 Scale Rating: 4.5 (Mediocre) ...\r The Good: No complaints on the performances in this film as Costner, Steinfeld, and Heard gave it their all and did what they could with a poor script. Some of the action sequences were very well done and a handful of the more humorous scenes garnered a chuckle. Heard looked the part of the femme fatale and seemed to have a lot of fun in the role. Costner was believable as a CIA agent trying to re-connect with his family.\r The Bad: The story is beyond preposterous and even if you suspend belief, it just doesn't work. The action side of things was at least adequate, but the dramatic family side was not well done. They also tried too hard to make it a humorous film and the overwhelming majority of these scenes missed the mark. Also, Costner's character is a sick man who is dying ... but certainly did not fight or shoot like one."

It had this terrible combination of a sunny day, but with a grey color correction that just made it look muddy. The plot is nonsensical and some moments were just hilariously bad. The actors did a fairly good job, especially Kevin Costner, who was probably the only good thing out of this film. The editing is clunky, with some scenes that just felt illogically put together. I've pretty much given up on MCG. Aside from some well made action sequences and a charming Kevin Costner as the main character, it's terrible. DON'T WATCH IT."

It's all Costner (who is quite good) and Hailee Steinfeld (who is excellent as the rebellious teenager).

Kevin Costner plays a \"cleaner\" for the CIA, who retires so he can salvage his relationship with his daughter (Hailee Steinfeld).

Luc Besson penned the story, so it\u2019s got interesting developments on the personal and action sides. Director McG has managed to balance both angles with warmth and some inventive fights.

It was more like a French thriller and should have been a French movie as well, but Hollywood borrowed it from a famous French filmmaker. This cast and crew team was great so expectation will be there like always. In this 2 hour movie everyone did not get fair screen presence except Kevin Costner. It was not long ago I saw the little girl in the movie 'True Grit', now she has all grown up here. Good to see her, hope the future will shape up well for her.\r It was the story of a top US secret agent who comes to know that his life is not going to wait for anyone any longer. He decides to spend his rest of the life with his closest ones. But the past follows him and urges his requirement in the field to eliminate the bad guys. In exchange, they offer something life changer. Now at a time he has to cope with his family as well the duty assigned to him. The rest of the story tells how he manages all the difficulties.\r They have tried too much ingredients and stirred in a one movie. That did not clinch well all together. In fact, multiple plot with each stream of the story had different genres that terribly ruined the movie's standardness. The pace was the issue here, it was not constant. When the action sequences begin it flows at a rapid speed, then it comes back to the normal that did not convince followed by the darkly humorous in parts. This is a time pass movie and expecting from it is like a foolish. You would accomplish watching it, in the end most of you won't be happy for what you had seen and probably decide to put into an average list."

      "text": "A slightly different twist on \"a veteran agent goes on a killing spree in Europe\" plot, 3 Days to Kill is incredibly predictable and not without cheesy plot in every turn. Kevin Costner is a retired terminally-ill agent recruited back as a black ops assassin, by a seductive spy lady no less, to kill elusive marks in exchange for a magical drug that might or might not save his life. Here lies the biggest problem, while it may be true he's desperate enough to resort to the extremes, note that a dying man is no way in shape or form qualified to hunt down an international fugitive, because he's dying.\r Assuming that throwing resources as leverage to motivate a retired agent is a good idea, the movie also introduces its heavily glamorized femme fatale, complete with fantasy setting from 80's pulp spy flick. This alpha female, played by Amber Heard, is always shrouded in sensual mystery, equipped with capable aptitude that ultimately begs the question whether she doesn't do the deed herself in the first place. It looks odd as she appears out of nowhere just in the right time like James Bond's fairy godmother only to quip or taunt.\r Aside from its awkward secret operative angle, the movie mostly focuses on family value. Luc Besson's style is clearly present, as in Taken. It's commendable that it tries to involve the characters in modest way, and to some degree it works decently, but it's hampering the sense of desperation its title describes, or misleads. Some of the scenes are pretty much a father, on his last remaining times, attempting to bond with his estranged daughter. It has some good moments and the acting is not bad, but it utilizes many corny scenarios that the relationship doesn't feel fully realized.\r Editing possesses some problems too. In many scenes, the transition is too fast, thus somewhat resulting in fragmented progression. This works better in some instances, especially action sequences, but it needs more finesse to weave through each act smoother. Sound effect is a silly rendition of Inception inspired music or recent movie trailers excessive hum. It plays this throb noise like in dubstep music for everything that happens. It's not just an annoying repetitive echo; it also produces more comical effect in some cases.\r Comedy is hackneyed at most, although it brings chuckle sometimes. The movie resorts to some corny situations in attempt for mild humor or heartwarming scenes, only a couple of them succeed in doing either. Technical aspect of action is presentable. While it doesn't rise to large scale explosion or fluid cinematography, it functions in its intended purpose. Some short bursts of clever camera angle or surprisingly gritty scenes prove to be effective. If only they were translated to the whole movie, it could've been much better.\r Tidbits of good parts can't elevate the entirety of the humdrum movie. It's ironic that the title is an analogy for wasting time, because that's exactly what this movie does."

      "text": "I believe this movie's a bit underrated, so I decided to write a little something in its defense. In 3 Days to Kill, basically, Kevin Costner plays Liam Neeson and the movie sits in the \"Middle-aged guy has to go and kill a bunch of people for that last time\" genre.\rJust like Costner's character, the movie tries to balance ass-kicking with family affairs. And it performs quite admirably, with a decent action scene occurring just in time to dilute the family scenes. What is a definite plus for 3DTK, is that the aforementioned family stuff isn't as irritating as it is in many similar films. Here, it is presented with a good deal of humor, which makes it watchable. Speaking of humor, it, to my surprise, is in abundance here, with some characters being so ridiculous they're even funny. The result is that some scenes and character interactions (like the \"interrogations\") are very unrealistic and akin to some comedy sketches, but entertaining nevertheless.\rObviously, flaws are also present. Firstly, speaking of family, Costner's character's daughter is quite irritating both in her look and actions. Secondly, Amber Heard's character is, while obviously hot, also pretty weird, which leads to the third problem, that is, an overall bland and inconsistent plot. I might also add that for a Taken-style movie, it could have more melee fighting scenes, and ones with better fight choreography.\rTo sum up, 3 Days to Kill is a decent action movie that gets nonsensical at times, but its good pacing, decent action scenes, unexpectedly funny situations and Kevin Costner's charisma make it work, earning it a solid 7 out of 10 by my standards."

      "text": "How did 3 Days to Kill, which doesn\u2019t have the worst imaginable premise, turn out this bad? The problem starts with the screenplay, co-credited to Adi Hasak and over-the-top action aficionado Luc Besson. Still, although the more serious aspects of the script, especially the clich\u00e9-riddled fractious father/daughter relationship, lack flair, the writing on the whole isn\u2019t terrible. Besson in particular knows how to mix genres and never takes things too seriously. It\u2019s pretty evident he intended 3 Days to Kill to be a comedy thriller. Unfortunately, single-moniker director McG (Charlie\u2019s Angels) didn\u2019t get the memo.\r Sure, there\u2019s some wacky humor to be found in the final cut. The scenes featuring Amber Heard are weird enough to convey a sense of what Besson was likely going for. However, Kevin Costner is so somber and serious that he sucks out any sense of fun. Costner has made his share of comedies but it\u2019s apparent he didn\u2019t see this as one. Worse, the action scenes - which are pedestrian at best - are shunted off to the side to make room for one of the most tedious estranged father-wins-back-daughter\u2019s-affection subplots ever to grace the silver screen. This material is awful. Costner and Hailee Steinfeld play the scenes like they were written by a great dramatist but every phrase they utter is hackneyed, there\u2019s minimal chemistry between them, and nothing they do carries any emotional weight. It\u2019s artificial, annoying, and boring. There\u2019s not a single human moment in this film and any minimal momentum McG generates comes to a dead stop when these two are interacting.\r The storyline transpires in Besson\u2019s alternate universe where cops are incompetent boobs who never do anything more than interfere on the periphery and the laws of physics are suspended when required by the plot. Costner plays Ethan Renner, a CIA lifer who is diagnosed with a form of inoperable brain cancer that causes him black out at inopportune moments (like when he\u2019s about to bring down the bad guy). The doctors give him three months to live, so he quits his job and heads back to his home in Paris to reconnect with his estranged wife, Christine (Connie Nielsen), and daughter, Zoey (Steinfeld). The teenager is resentful of him (evident by her insistence in calling him \u201cEthan\u201d instead of \u201cDad\u201d) so, when Mom conveniently has to leave the country for a few days, Ethan offers to play babysitter. This leads to tender moments at an amusement park and an adorable scene in which Ethan teaches his daughter how to ride a bike. Gag.\r The CIA isn\u2019t quite ready to let Ethan go. Top operative Vivi Delay (Amber Heard) needs his help to take out a couple of terrorist-types, The Albino (Tomas Lemarquis) and The Wolf (Richard Sammel). She offers him a deal: if he kills both of them, she\u2019ll give him access to an experimental drug that will extend his life. Unfortunately for Ethan, the period when Vivi requires his cooperation coincides with the time when he\u2019s chaperoning Zoey. Hilarity ensues. Not really.\r It\u2019s easy enough to see the film\u2019s comedic potential and just as easy to identify how badly it botches the opportunity. Just about the only thing McG gets right is the handling of Vivi. She\u2019s a bizarre, off-the-wall character - a living monument to fetishes of all flavors. The PG-13 rating, which McG constantly pushes, is at its most restrictive when she\u2019s around. One gets the sense that, given some latitude, McG might have gone full-R with this character. Heard is deliciously over-the-top and livens things up when she\u2019s on screen. Unfortunately, that\u2019s maybe 10-15 minutes. The rest of time, we\u2019re stuck with a brooding, grizzled, unshaven Costner.\r The thing about 3 Days to Kill isn\u2019t that every other line of dialogue sounds canned and every other action causes the viewer\u2019s eyes to roll. It\u2019s that the movie isn\u2019t fun. And, more than anything else, Luc Besson stands for fun. Stupid fun, perhaps. Silly, violent fun, for sure. But fun. 3 Days to Kill is a slog. A chore. A tiresome 113 minutes in a theater that makes the idea of grouting the bathroom tiles seem preferable. After a number of years in relative obscurity, Costner has decided to re-emerge. Because I like and respect him, I\u2019m glad to know he has several projects in the works. It\u2019s just a shame this is one of them."

      "text": "Luc Besson recruits McG and Kevin Costner for a fatally compromised tale of an American spy in Paris.\r The setup plays as if someone (presumably Besson, who is credited with the story and co-wrote the script with \u201cFrom Paris With Love\u201d scribe Adi Hasak) decided to graft the central father/daughter relationship from \u201cThe Descendants\u201d onto a Eurotrashy action framework. Superstar CIA field agent Ethan Renner (Costner) spends so much time on the job that he\u2019s completely missed watching his daughter, Zooey (Hailee Steinfeld), blossom into a sophisticated teenager. After he\u2019s diagnosed with a fatal illness, Ethan retires and resolves to spend more time with his family in Paris, offering to watch Zooey for a weekend while his estranged wife, Christine (Connie Nielsen), is away. But retirement isn\u2019t so easy for a man of Ethan\u2019s skills, and he\u2019s promptly recruited by the mysterious Vivi (Amber Heard), who needs his help in the hunt for a terrorist mastermind in exchange for experimental drugs that could give Ethan a second lease on life.\r The conflict between the finesse Ethan demonstrates in his professional duties and the complete incompetence with which he approaches parenting is meant to be comedic, although the film doesn\u2019t have the light touch of similar spy-family action-laffers like \u201cMr. and Mrs. Smith,\u201d \u201cTrue Lies\u201d or McG\u2019s own \u201cThis Means War.\u201d Instead, \u201c3 Days to Kill\u201d proves surprisingly po-faced about trying to build the bond between Ethan and Zooey, even in the midst of moments as goofy as Dad consoling his daughter on a bad hair day, teaching her to dance or buying her a purple bicycle just because that was her favorite color as a kid. The sentimental approach almost works, thanks to the best efforts of Costner and the naturally spunky Steinfeld, who may have made a respectable pair given better material to work with.\r As it is, the lukewarm family dynamics sit awkwardly alongside equally underwhelming action sequences. Recent supporting turns in \u201cMan of Steel\u201d and \u201cJack Ryan: Shadow Recruit\u201d aside, Costner isn\u2019t generally associated with the action genre \u2014 he\u2019s more of a \u201cWaterworld\u201d/\u201dRobin Hood: Prince of Thieves\u201d epic-adventure guy \u2014 and the rote heroics he undertakes here won\u2019t do much to change that. On multiple occasions, the audience simply witnesses the aftermath of Ethan\u2019s handiwork as repped by bodies lying motionless on the floor. The notable exceptions arrive in a brief but slickly executed one-on-one skirmish in a grocery store\u2019s deli section (complete with resourceful use of the meat grinder and panini press) and a bracingly staged car chase in the middle of a Parisian neighborhood inspired by Claude Lelouch\u2019s \u201cRendezvous\u201d and John Frankenheimer\u2019s \u201cRonin.\u201d\r That chase makes a lovely pairing with McG\u2019s other standout sequence: a montage of Ethan riding the bike he bought for Zooey through the city streets and parking near the Eiffel Tower. It\u2019s a sweet divertissement for the typically boisterous director, who overall reins in the bombastic giddiness of his \u201cCharlie\u2019s Angels\u201d pictures and abandons the soulless spectacle of \u201cTerminator: Salvation\u201d to make an action film that\u2019s downright restrained by his standards. Unfortunately, in this case the restraint reads as overly safe. \u201c3 Days to Kill\u201d is quite literally bloodless \u2014 the fight sequences in \u201cTaken\u201d packed a far more potent punch even with the same PG-13 rating \u2014 which seems like a missed opportunity. The juxtaposition of Ethan\u2019s violent work and gentler paternal side might have added some desperately needed intrigue to the banal story.\r The filmmakers certainly don\u2019t find any of the intended mystery in Ethan\u2019s fitful encounters with the femme-fatale-ish Vivi, a severely under-realized character who never makes any sense despite Heard\u2019s arduous efforts to vamp it up. Nielsen\u2019s thankless skeptical spouse role is even less significant, while Tomas Lemarquis and Richard Sammel bring nothing beyond menacing visages to their bland terrorist baddies. It\u2019s a running gag that Ethan seeks parenting advice from just about anyone he encounters, which offers decent moments for character actors Eriq Ebouaney as the African paterfamilias in a family squatting in Ethan\u2019s semi-abandoned apartment, and Marc Andreoni as a Middle Eastern limo driver linked to the villains.\r Although the film\u2019s tech package is reliably proficient, one would have hoped for more onscreen fireworks from the union of ultra-American McG and Costner with French mainstay Besson. Alas, this European vacation is a time-killer of the most mundane variety."
