      "text": "So much wasted potential here.  With a talented voice cast and great animation one would think this would be an easy win however, watching this from beginning to end was just exhausting.  Many of the \"jokes\" either just don't land or end up being overused to the point they're just not funny by the end of the movie.  While the point of the story is to be stupid fun the writing and execution are just astoundingly bad here.  Truth be told, if this had been broken and made into a mini-series I think it could have been good, but as is I would not recommend."

      "text": "While the movie itself did seem to overstay it's welcome about 10-15 minutes too long, they still kept up with fun, self-aware, and poignant jokes that you just couldn't help but laugh at. I thoroughly enjoyed just turning my brain off and being entirely entertained for an hour+. Well worth the watch - especially if you have someone else who finds stupid funny to match their sense of humor."

Humorous cartoon for adults that deliver what you expect from the trailer:Plenty of action, un-censored dark humor, Pop-culture references, blood, comedy self-deprecation, easter eggs and some clever moking of stereotypes.Hope in a sequel of some sort"

      "text": "A glorious, deranged anthem to the overthrow of King James and his Redcoats, AMERICA: THE MOTION PICTURE is a raucous, gory good time. I laughed almost from start to finish with this, and while it's most certainly not for everyone, it finds it's own charm with being so consistently over the top. Featuring a fantastic cast of voices and a joyfully bizarre plot, AMERICA: THE MOTION PICTURE is yet another hilarious animated film of 2021. A perfect 4th of July watch."

I really liked it, I mean, I get it's not for everyone but I find it really round, I was laughing my ass off all the time. People criticize it's contant absurd humor but that it's what I find so appealing about it, this movie it's nothing without it and that's fine, it really does it's job well."
