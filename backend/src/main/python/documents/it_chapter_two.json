He gives a nod to this where he pocks fun at himself through Bill's character who is unable to give a satisfactory ending to his work.   There's also a great deal of humour in the book as well, this is how the characters deal with the all the horror they face. Pennywise has absolute control of the town, controls both what children & adults see and don't see, is the cause of many major catastrophe's that occur in the town when it awakens every 27 years, leaving many unsolved murders. Had a great time watching the movie, highly recommend, can't wait to see it all put together when it's released on dvd."

The movie is shown in flash backs just like and throughout the book, its an excellent adaptation from a book that is in part very \"out there\",the ending of the movie has been changed & told in a way that is comprehensible to non-book readers. It's a shame that a large portion of Mike Hanlon's character especially was changed and left out, the racism that he and his parents suffered was very horrific. Despite the complaints of the length of the film, I felt it ended too soon, I wanted to see more character development with most of the characters.  But my main complaint is the letter from Stan, they should have left it as the book, that it was fear that drove him to take his life. I'm looking forward to the 6 hours cut that's been promised when it's released on bluray."

The movie is also very long, and it doesn't have the right pacing to mask this length.If you care more about being entertained and empathizing with characters as opposed to feeling scared, You'll probably have a great time. Also skip the soda if you don't like getting up to pee - not kidding it's a really long movie :)"

      "text": "IT: Chapter Two was one of my most anticipated films of the year. The 2017 IT is one of my favorite movies I have seen in the past decade. It's a masterpiece of horror that has so much to say about friendship and overcoming life's challenges, and it's scary! Does the second installment that takes place 27 years in the future deliver on the promise the end of the first movie made?No. Not quite.IT: Chapter Two shines when it comes to it's acting performances. Bill Skarsgard remains an iconic Pennywise. The adult Losers are really good as well. James McAvoy and Jessica Chastain are amazing, but the real standout star is Bill Hader. Bill Hader brings so much sass and vulnerability to the adult Richie Tozier, and he is hands down the best part of the movie.Where does Chapter 2 fall short?The biggest and most notable problem this sequel has is that it is way too reliant on jumpscares, to the point where they became predictable and boring by the end of the film. On that note, the script is way too long and goes in circles, and this movie's three hour runtime could easily have been cut to an hour and a half. Another glaring problem is that the CGI in this sequel just doesn't look good, and a lot of the scares are so reliant on CGI that they aren't even scary. In fact, in a general aesthetic cinematography sense, the movie itself doesn't look as good as the first one, and it was really disappointing to see.However, all that being said, I still found myself enjoying IT: Chapter Two. While the first movie is a philosophical portrait of young adulthood, this sequel is a carnival rollercoaster. IT: Chapter Two is tacky, but it's a hell of a ride."

But that can be explained away as It swaying the Losers into an opportunity for It to try to scare them one by one once again."

I  laughed a bunch of times during the movie. Other times you did not know what was going, so it was scary. The movie had a great mix of horror and comedy. Going into the movie, I thought that it would be terrifying, but after watching it, I saw that it was not a top-notch horror film like, The Shining. There was maybe a bit too many special effects used, but the effects were done and incorporated very well. I really enjoyed how throughout the movie, the characters were gaining there memories of them as kids during the first IT movie. There is an outstanding transition in the movie between the characters having flashbacks and the characters being in the present. Overall, IT Chapter 2 was done very well and if you are willing to sit for a 2 hour and 45 minute movie, are a big horror fan and do not want to see an insanely scary horror movie, or if you do, I highly recommend going to see this movie."

      "text": "While entertaining and funny at many points, It: Chapter Two is a lot messier, bloated, and less charming than the first part. Bill Hader and James Ransone really steal the movie with great comedy and pitch-perfect representations of their child counterparts. The rest of the cast is pretty solid as well, although Bill Skarsgard's Pennywise gets noticeably less screen time this around. The movie's central problem comes from its insanely bloated runtime, as the film runs nearly three hours and it sure feels like it. With better direction and a better editor, the film could've been easily around 2 hours. The ending as well feels cheesy and ironic considering a running joke in the film. In addition, much like the first part, the horror is mostly cheap jump scares with a couple of scary visuals. Overall, It: Chapter Two is a film with good comedy and casting, but poor plotting, mediocre horror, and a ridiculously bloated runtime make it a mediocre experience overall."

Not even to mention the task of putting a creature that can't even be explained in the book on screen. The cast is fantastically up to the task and the movie only dragged at around the 1-hour mark. Before that and after it flew and I was on the edge of my seat. Truthful to the text, funny, deep, smart, and scary in different ways. Ch. 1 was DEFINITELY a \"horror\" flick. This one was more of an adventure story with some scares and eerie things mixed in. They are adults, they're harder to scare. Makes sense to me. Great adaption of a great book."

I know people say the movie was too long, but as a reader of the original book , I can confidently say that it\u2019s not. It is a challenge in itself to summarize a 1200 page book in less than 5,5h of total movie time. In my opinion some important parts of the book were left out, like Henry almost killing Mike thus Mike has to go to a hospital and deal with Zombies from Pennywise . Then the rest of the Loosers Club building an engery-circle to give Mike power to defeat those Zombies. But all in all it was a great movie.8.4/10"

      "text": "While The Conjuring franchise will most likely (and rightfully) go down as James Wan's greatest contribution to the horror scene, filmgoers shouldn't overlook how influential his Insidious movies were to the genre as we know it today. They were big haunted house style attractions that are just as funny as they are scary. You can see countless imitators popping up in theaters regularly trying to capture that same rollercoaster combination of thrills and chills. Andy Muschietti's two IT movies are very much products of that.The previous film was very much an '80s coming-of-age, comedy-adventure film \u00e0 la The Goonies or Explorers that just so happened just so happened to have a homicidal clown darkening the tone a bit. Chapter 2 ends up being just as funny, but now that the characters have grown up the content has gotten a fair bit more graphic. Children are murdered in gruesome fashion and Pennywise has tricks that are even more disturbing up his sleeve this time around. Personally, this is one of the reasons I think it's a better movie.Another one is that it wasn't afraid of taking some of the book's more hard to translate material and put it onscreen. The results are a more fleshed out and faithful adaptation that just so happens to have a lengthy running time some might find exhausting. You can tell they had to leave some stuff on the cutting room floor in order to keep this a strictly two chapter affair (i.e a lack of justification for Bower's return). The only time that really bothered me though was at the very beginning of the movie. I felt they rushed getting the \"Loser's Club\" back together. We really didn't get to see who they turned into as adults and how they still were clinging to problematic aspects of their past even after all those years. Some nuance was lost as a result. Although it was made up for in the final act where they have to face their demons in a battle of wills in order to lay their collective biggest one to rest for good.I feel like they did a phenomenal job with the casting. With the exception of maybe Bill, I can actually see the kids from the previous movie growing up to be these people. That's really freaking cool.Like the book, these movies have a soft spot for the broken, downtrodden, and the outcasts. It's a group of bullied kids that face trouble at school and at home ultimately staring down the evil that infects their town after all. However, even though they represent a variety of features society deems weaknesses, they're ultimately not very diverse with only one girl and minority amongst a group of primarily straight white males. Chapter 2 tries to fix this by changing one members sexuality. It just flat out doesn't work. Aside from the issues already inherent with changing the identity of a previously established character, the decision ends up feeling like an afterthought. Especially in the face of a much more effective portrayal of the kind of violent discrimination homosexuals have experienced that occurs at the very beginning of the film and is actually based on material from the novel. To be brutally honest they did a better job of making this sequel feel more inclusive by giving the black man back his role after passing it off to one of the white characters in the previous outing (yeah, still ticked about that). Glad to see they did Mike right this time around.The return trip to Pennywise's deranged circus is certainly a long one, but it's filled with unforgettable moments both hilarious and unsettling. I had a blast with its mix of horror, humor, and heart. While there a few things I take issue with I feel like Chapter 2 did just enough to edge out the 2017 flick as the better movie and found it to be a totally satisfying conclusion to a 27 year long battle between a group of kids and a clown."
