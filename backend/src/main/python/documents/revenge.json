      "text": "Some people lack all sense of proportion by giving a movie like this a score that equals such movies as Alien(81 vs 83) or, more into the revenge scene, outscore Hard Candy(56???) or the Brave one. High scores suggest a good story, good acting, good cinematography and a good music score. Revenge does not deliver on any of these.    Perhaps, the best is the cinematography. It is at times unusual and sometimes comes above the level of decent but it is seldom put to good use and often followed by such bad camera work that you got the feeling that two people were working on this at the same time. And maybe there were. The music is not bad and sometimes even the best part, but again it is lackluster most of the time and just used in a bad way. The acting is not atrocious, but clearly these are not good actors, they feel like those Italian support actors Spaghetti western were filled with, whose only role was to be gunned down by the main actors. What can be said is that the female lead takes the cake simply because after some initial dialogue has no lines anymore. Silence is golden.The worst part is the story and how it is told. This lack of a good plot is drowned with ample buckets of blood which is so ridiculous that non of the tension from the combat convinces. Especially at the end the setup is so botched with too many blood that I just had to skip the scene to the end. It isn't gory, it is just plain silly.So the story: a girl is pushed from a cliff and gets speared on a branch in a dead tree after a drop of thirty feet. Had the movie started with this then it would have been engaging but alas we are about a third or so in. In fact, they could have started with her dragging her body through the desert, prompting us to ponder how she got there, and why. And had the pursuers just be silent men who hunted her instead of having us witness their atrocious dialogue. Again adding to the intrigue. This start would have gone nice with the interesting camera angles as she hangs in the tree and seems to die. Or while she scrambles through the desert and she slowly gets delirious.The problem is that we never get to understand how this girl, with a foot long piece of wood through her kidney area is able to go on. In fact she leaves a bloody trail behind her and kills a guy, before she finally drags herself to a cave to tend to that wound. Mind you, she only patches up the exit end, the other side, we see in some shots, is not getting treated, but has apparently healed by itself. If they had just made better used of the powerful drug she has with her, it would have been believable that it was that that made her go on, but no.. even that explanation is not used.The rest of the movie makes you not only wonder how this girl is able to go on, but makes you wonder why she doesn't run away. She is a sweet girl with, as far as we know, no combat experience or PTSD, heavily wounded, raped and smashed up. I would have ran the moment I had the chance. And she gets that chance even: she gets a car and she can now flee the scene, giving her the opportunity to exact revenge in another way(watch the movie to understand) but no this movie has to go pick the obvious but inexplainable route of having her confront the last guy.And here is possible the big failure of this story. There is no plausible explanation for why she does what she does, what makes her tick and go on instead of collapsing into a ball of pain or running away when she can.In all this doesn't make for a good movie, it doesn't show humans, it shows clich\u00e9 characters that make the unblievable in an unbelievable story and giving this more than a five is being generous.."

      "text": "Ignore the paid reviewers, and the \"it empowers wahmen\" reviewers. This is bad movie. It starts out decent, I can see potential, then it just gets stupid. Incredibly stupid. I found out the writer and director are the same person, which explains how a pump shotgun was being referred to and used as a scoped rifle, despite being loaded with shells. It also explains how any number of stupid things are done as they make no sense. I suspect the writer/director has never gone camping in her life, or ever handled a firearm. I feel dumber having watched most of the movie. In the end I just gave up because it was a gore-fest with no redeeming plot, but a lot of shots that were added purely for \"artistic\" value or to pound the foreshadowing into the viewer's head with the subtlety of repeated blows from a sledgehammer.Since the writer/director may actually read this. Here is some advice. Cut the BS political message. You can have a strong female lead, but don't make an utterly moronic plot in order to depict an otherwise stupid girl as some sort of hero. Cut the foreshadowing/artistic shots. Just get rid of them if you can't make it subtle. Films can be artistic, but sacrificing actual plot for gratuitous artistic shots is bad film making. You should be asking yourself \"how does this forward the plot?\" If the answer is \"it doesn't\", then don't include it. Don't actually make a movie until you have ironed out the improbabilities and impossibilities. I am not a idiot, and you shouldn't be making movies for idiots. It is both immersion breaking and insulting when the audience is supposed to buy into something utterly stupid. Cut the blood/gore. In fact I suggest not making movies that use it at all, since you clearly don't know how to use blood/gore. It isn't something you throw into a scene to hide the fact the scene is crap. All you are doing is making bloody/gorey crap. Blood should be used like punctuation. You don't write with 15 exclamation marks on every line, and you shouldn't use blood excessively where it doesn't need to be used. There, I have given you career advancing advice, you can thank me later in life when you realize I am write. Oh, I have friends in the film industry, and I tell them when their films are crap too."

The silliness really starts when a women is pushed off a cliff (maybe 100m high)and lands on a tiny tree which impales her. The tree is so small and the cliff so high that regardless of being impaled the tree would have been flattened by the impact but no, a small 1 inch diameter branch holds her suspended above the ground.Barely have your eyes stopped rolling and she reaches out for a cigarette lighter, even though she does not smoke, which luckily landed within arms reach after the fall. She then ignites some grass at the base of the tree to set it on fire (yes the tree she is impaled on)which miraculously causes the tree to more or less disintegrate so she is no longer impaled. Though despite this she appears not to have been burned, the whole thing is totally cartoonish. The movie never recovers from this ****The same scenes are shot in different locations, there is 1 scene where 1 of the guys tries to run her over where the shot of the approach is in a different location to the shot of the car departing from her, again amateurish.There is another scene of her cauterising her wound after pulling out a bit of the tree that impaled her (after losing many litres of blood). The problem is there is no wound at her back (there must be an entry and exit hole).Basically most scenes will have the eyes rolling it is just so bad."

      "text": "Hey,guys. So,given the fact that I had nothing to do on Sunday,I decided to watch the movie 'Revenge',the independent R-Rated movie from Writer/Director Coralie Fargeat.I was curious to see this movie right after seeing an ad on Instagram and I was interested in it,especially given the rating. And in my opinion,Revenge is a movie whose R-Rating is used in the most graphic and violent way that not even the Tarantino movies would try to do. Not a single frame from this straight-forward plot gets consumed without something splatting its way out of someone's body with the most ridiculous amount of g...Oil Splatter I've ever seen,It could probably make someone check out in the first 20-25 Minutes. This does also have the look and feel of an independent movie,but whenever an action sequence would pop-up,it feels like an American production all of a sudden,and if I said ''straight-forward'' with the plot,it's because sometimes I didn't find myself invested with the plot,already knowing what was going to happen. Although every one of those men gets enough writing to the point to where you're scared of what is this character going to do next. Speaking of the acting,I feel like this should've been Matilda Lutz's first role instead of Rings. She manages to encapsulate the total badassery that every action hero should get. Probably one that I didn't see a long time ago (like Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2). Overall,this is a pretty enjoyable R-Rated action movie,that will be able to please everyone wanting some Oil Splattering moments here and there for the entire picture.It's my favourite action movie of 2018 so far,that's for sure."

      "text": "Relentlessly brutal and radiating with style, Revenge is a movie that hauls its audience through a ride almost too extreme to handle. The story may be basic and rather predictable but it is rich with symbolism and vibrant themes. Meanwhile, the stylistic imagery and vivid flow of the movie raise the experience to a highly memorable level. Likewise, the entire cast (lead by Matilda Lutz) strikes the difficult balance of authenticity and exaggeration. Overall, the vision of Coralie Fargeat (writer/director) is clear.Whether you like exotic cinematic moments that artfully build connection or you prefer breakneck action that will have you at the edge of your seat, Revenge is a film that flawlessly switches gears and drowns its viewers in its vile situations. Some may call Revenge too flashy for its own good but those viewers are missing the point. Among other messages, Revenge is about the union between beauty & ugliness which it packs together into a powerful punch.

It also helps that the two leads are very easy on the eye. Early scenes command attention and interest is kept high as one contemplates just where events will lead. However, the hunting down of culprits goes on for far too long to the overall detriment of the film. Sound is great and body make up is very convincing, the effects of which are sometimes hard to watch. The final confrontation is satisfyingly brutal bloody and exciting."

      "text": "the story felt like its written by some high school girl who was trying to write something edgy feminist during her boring history class. it did have some nice shots that felt like they belong to some dior perfume ad. but basically its a movie about this irresponsible blond who took the risk to have some fun with some hot rich married guy out in the middle of the desert. jens was not a good moral person, nor smart, nor strong. pretty unlikable from the start. the movie just presented her to the audience as some hot nympho who manipulated men to fall for her desire in the first 10mins. there was very little to feel for her other than the fact that she was a rape victim, and that was not compelling enough for me to root for her, while she ran around the rocky desert bare feet for 2 days with a speared thru torso AND without dying from blood loss or infection. The acting was horrendous. There were an incredible amount of holes throughout the entire movie. wheres the entry wound? the hunter didnt know how to hold his weapon? Where did the bullet hole go on the headrest? did they just run around in a circle for 5mins?you might compare quentin tarantinos kill bill and that would be an insult to mr tarantino.

      "text": "I found it very disheartening to read a lot of comments on the trailer for this movie decrying it as \"feminist propaganda\" and claiming that the same story with reversed gender roles would cause riots in the streets. I decided to give it a go, and I must say that while imperfect, it is very good both as a technical piece, as well as a feminist message. As a technical piece, I think that it has a very unique and defined style that might turn some people off, but is overall quite enjoyable. It actually isn't that fast-paced, but when the action picks up it is very well executed and suspenseful. There is minimal dialogue, and so a lot of the allure comes from the acting (which is stellar - so much of the film relies on body language and facial expressions in order to communicate, not just dialogue), and from the overall aesthetic of the film. The dry, hot, seemingly endless desert is a perfect backdrop, and we really get a sense of the desperation that all the characters feel. Again, it did lag in some parts, but they were few and far between, and the action was very well executed. I would say the style is roughly similar to a movie like Drive: color palettes, cinematography, and minimal dialogue all contribute to the visual storytelling, and it could even be described as minimalist. As a feminist message, I felt this movie truly excelled. This part of the review partially works to refute some of the criticisms I've heard, many of which come from people who haven't even seen the movie, only the trailer! Basically, the three male characters are very humanized. That is to say that many of us - myself included - know men who exhibit some of the characteristics that these men exhibit. I also think the film does a good job of making each male character very different from the other two, and so they all have their own version of misogyny that is distinct, yet still very common in society. I am a man, and cannot speak to how women interact with men, but I am guessing that many women have had interactions quite similar to the interactions that the female protagonist has with the male characters. Thus, it was very realistic, but it wasn't there for the sake of it. Each character has a purpose, and role within the story, and it reflects the many kinds of sexism that women have to deal with. One criticism has been that the film is not realistic, and if you watch the trailer you would know why (and I will admit, in real life someone probably wouldn't survive such a fall). But I think that this is a really flimsy argument, and something you don't see much of with other movies. I've seen a short video describing how there are some 10 instances in Die Hard when John McClane, had he been a real person, would have died - but we don't care, because it's an action movie and it's exciting and the point of the story isn't to be a documentary, but rather to have us grip the edge of our seats throughout. This movie is the same: It isn't trying to be a documentary, and it knows that it is somewhat sensationalizing the actions on the screen. The fact of the matter is that many women are not only assaulted, but they are ignored, or are silenced, and are bullied for what they have been through. This film not only shows how truly debilitating that is, and how frustrating it is to have so many men working to drag them down, but also how it takes an immense amount of pain tolerance and willpower to overcome it, and achieve justice. It is not just the literal story of a woman seeking revenge on her attackers, but it is a visual representation of what so many survivors of assault go through in a non-literal sense. The protagonist is incredibly strong, resilient, and intelligent. She does things I could never do simply because I am too weak. And sadly, there are many women who are unable to fight back the way that she does, for a whole multitude of reasons, many of which have a lot more to do with systems of oppression, and not the qualities of said woman. I see no reason why this woman should not be praised - she is raped, left for dead, alone, and she does not give up. Anyone who does not cheer for that has something wrong with them, in my opinion. Obviously, you do not /have/ to like this movie. There are many people who I'm sure have very legitimate complaints about its style, pacing, lack of dialogue, etc. However, I thought it was a very well-made film, and I think that if you are a feminist like I am you should definitely watch it. It has some very interesting ideas for a film with so little to the story, and I think a lot of people could learn a little bit if they watched this film. Even if you are not a feminist, you might just enjoy the movie as a heart-racing rape and revenge thriller flick, and you might get a better understanding as to why so many of us view feminism as so important."

The performance is the only branch that is undergrown than its surrounding, having said that the work that went behind it is genuinely appreciative if not effective by Matilda Anna Ingrid Lutz.

      "text": "Revenge is a constant barrage of absurdity, and a beautifully crafted one at that. Writer-director Coralie Fargeat holds absolutely nothing back in this thriller as she utilizes every possible tool of graphicness to thrust viewers into a state of discomforting distress that is grotesquely fitting for a story of violence and vengeance such as this.The plot itself never moves beyond its bare-bones state: woman is assaulted and left for dead, survives, then goes on a rampage seeking retribution. That's essentially all this film is. But although it's simplistic in its story, the way it tells that story is seamless and visually spectacular. The cinematography and music shift throughout the film in such a way that every scene is tied together to articulate the harsh transition that Jen makes from sheltered socialite to hardened survivor. This is a film about survival, and the plot is advanced using very little dialogue and lots of detailed visual cues. This visual storytelling would not work without actors that are capable of such a vast array of emotion that says everything about their characters without using words. Because of the cast's talent, the plot flows seamlessly.That being said, all disbelief must be suspended during Revenge, and this is does not work out in the film's favor. The violence is so over-the-top in its blood and gore that it removes much of the sense of tension. The characters lose such crazy amounts of blood and it they don't seem to be nearly as adversely affected by it as they should; thus it takes away much of the fear for the heroine's safety. It seems that anything can happen to her and she will be completely fine. The villains also make several careless decisions that serve only to advance the plot.On the other hand, the rest of the non-gory aspects of the film display admirable realism: without spoiling anything, Jen fires a shotgun for the first time and the recoil actually knocks her off her feet, etc. It acknowledges the weaknesses of real people and it helps make up for the other absurd elements of the film. Revenge is a crazy thrill ride that is very much not for the faint of heart and it certainly does not make for pleasant, casual viewing.Story: 7.5Acting: 10Script: 5Visuals/Sound: 10Entertainment Value: 6OVERALL SCORE: 7.7/10"

Et dire que les films \"Tomb Raider\" sont aussi chiants et convenus que la pluie, aussi coinc\u00e9s du fion qu'une amiche cadenass\u00e9e \u00e0 triple tour !Mais l'action et la survie se d\u00e9ploient pendant ce temps-l\u00e0, tandis que la cocotte qui tortille du derri\u00e8re, va passer du statut de proie \u00e0 celui de chasseresse. Jane, qu'elle s'appelle, Jane Rambo je crois, \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on qu'elle a de se \"r\u00e9parer\" avec un couteau et... (c'est une surprise). Mais les gars aussi vont en chier des ronds de chapeau, car s'il est des choses dans ce nanar de qualit\u00e9 -qui s'assume jusqu'au bout- ce sont les hectolitres de sang !Ind\u00e9niablement violent donc et tr\u00e8s efficace malgr\u00e9 une mise en sc\u00e8ne parfois un peu agit\u00e9e (on ne court pas avec une cam\u00e9ra, bon sang !) mais \u00e7a reste rare, le reste s'av\u00e8re de bon aloi et m\u00eame un peu plus que \u00e7a, avec quelques efforts d'inventivit\u00e9 au niveau des plans et cadrages.Bien entendu, sa faiblesse est aussi sa force, \u00e0 savoir que les invraisemblances (nombreuses)  laissent incr\u00e9dules mais loin de s'en \u00e9carter, le film y plonge sans y regarder \u00e0 deux fois : l'exc\u00e8s est son cr\u00e9do ! et l'humour (qu'il soit vraiment involontaire ou non...) fournit de bonnes tranches de rire \u00e0 intervalles plus ou moins r\u00e9guliers. Qu'est-ce qu'on se bidonne...En fait, j'ai repens\u00e9 \u00e0 ce bon vieux Commando (avec Schwarzynator) en regardant Revenge : on y retrouve la m\u00eame violence d\u00e9complex\u00e9e et les m\u00eames exc\u00e8s. La musique est dans les deux cas, excellente, ce qui leur fait un autre point commun.Donc une belle r\u00e9ussite pour un film paradoxalement tr\u00e8s f\u00e9ministe : notre bombasse allumeuse y devient une furie d'une volont\u00e9 implacable : on l'admire et on la respecte, surtout qu'elle a bien plus de personnalit\u00e9 que cette grognasse de Lara Croft finalement."

      "text": "There are good rape-revenge movies and there are bad ones.  This one was just monumentally stupid.  I went in having read some of the bad reviews and was willing to suspend my disbelief for the sake of the film...I mean, aren't we all when it comes to action movies?  But this demanded way too much suspension of disbelief too early on, and it just got worse from there.  I don't want to get into too many details, but this piece of garbage was evidently shot using the first draft of the script without any consideration for \"Is what's happening right now at least remotely plausible?\"Rewrites and second drafts - totally worth the time you put into them."

      "text": "This film could very well be titled \"Following blood trails, the Movie\" since that is what makes up a majority of its runtime. With that out of the way, this film was a treat to watch. Cinematography, Choreography, Accompanying score, but the delivery by the non-native English speakers was really stilted and awkward. This film does require one to suspend their disbelief, as it is hardly plausible that the girl would neither die on impact nor from blood loss. Despite this, the scene where the ant is being rained on by blood, and the scene where they are following the blood trails were very well done and helped spice up the shot composition. The reincorporation that this film used caught me off guard. This is because the way that the drugs were introduced felt truly natural. It felt like an additional factor to accentuate the disparity in wealth and morals between the lead girl and the cast of men. Even with this being an engaging thriller, I felt it still had something to say. These things being, more or less; wealthy being exempt from laws and not blowing the whistle on others of wealth. Some scenes that I felt embodied this imparticular were the rape scene and the tarantula pee scene. I thought the dream sequence was really good, and the binoculars transition fit in well too. There was a definite 'man is an animal' motif, that at times was a bit too blatant, but still fitting, and powerful. The entirety of the third act was good, the false scare with the pool cleaner helped show the tangible nature of the tension at the time. I really enjoyed the use of the tv playing amidst the final chase. I enjoyed the scene where she was running in circles chasing her limping assailant, this was especially aided by the blood slowly blocking out her vision, and by proxy, the lens too. The ending was quite good with the sudden look back and the helicopter sound. I recommend this movie to fans if action films and horror films alike. Overall a pretty great movie."

      "text": "Revenge follows a girl, named Jen, who is brought out to her boyfriend's luxurious house in the middle of the desert. They hang out for a bit until two of her boyfriend's friends show up for a hunting trip. When the boyfriend goes away for a few hours one of the men rapes Jen, and then upon the boyfriend's return he offers her a job and money to forget about that happened, but she runs away and is eventually caught and pushed off of a cliff by the boyfriend and left for dead. Revenge is your typical revenge-tale film. The most original thing this film has to offer is how over-the-top the gore is, and while I'm all for that I don't think simply adding more gore to it makes it any better than any other revenge-tale flick. The cinematography is great, and it is awesome to see how Jen keeps herself alive and then goes after the men who tried to kill her, but there are also some very unbelievable moments throughout the story that made me get sucked out of it for a moment or two. And like I said, there's not really anything new here that blew me away. It's not a bad watch, though."

      "text": "Gory, but brilliantJen (a superb Matilda Lutz) and her married lover Richard (Kevin Janssens) are enjoying a romantic weekend in his isolated house in the desert. However, shortly after they arrive, Richard's friends, Stan (Vincent Colombe), Dimitri (Guillaume Bouch\u00e8de), and Roberto (Jean-Louis Tribes) show up unannounced, urging Richard to join them on a hunting trip. As tension mounts in the house, Stan rapes Jen, but when she says she is going to go to the police, and to alert Richard's wife of his affair, the men attack her and leave her for dead. However, unbeknownst to them, she survives the assault, and has set out on revenge.Very much in the vein of films such as Strawdogs (1971) and I Spit On Your Grave (1978), Revenge is an insanely gory rape-revenge thriller. In her feature debut, writer/director Coralie Fargeat displays an astonishing visual panache as she re-appropriates this exploitative sub-genre for the post #MeToo era. From the expansive Ford-esque vistas of the desert to the claustrophobic and labyrinthine finale, her visual language is as dexterous and thematically justified as one would expect from a master stylist such as Michael Mann. The film is very much about the dangers and darker implications of the male gaze, and the way Fargeat's constantly moving camera lingers on actress Matilda Lutz's half-naked body is deeply unsettling, challenging the audience to look at her in the same way the male characters do, before turning this notion on its head in the second half of the film. If you can ignore the plot contrivances, and stomach the gore, you will find a socially relevant film that is as auspicious a debut as you're likely to see all year."

      "text": "RevengeLas mujeres siempre tienen que plantar caraPocas veces se ajusta una clara caligraf\u00eda en el dominio del lenguaje cinematogr\u00e1fico en una \u00f3pera prima; Revenge es la excepci\u00f3n. Escrita y dirigida por la directora y guionista francesa Coraline Fargeat, Revenge pone de manifiesto el poder de la transformaci\u00f3n femenina en un contexto puramente masculino mediante multitud de met\u00e1foras y gui\u00f1os al cine de acci\u00f3n y sus derivados, tanto tarantinescos o carpenterianos como de la m\u00e1s pura serie B.Tres socios se re\u00fanen en una casa en pleno desierto para organizar una jornada de caza, pero en esta ocasi\u00f3n uno de ellos se ha llevado a una \u201camiguita\u201d. Este es el planteamiento de Revenge, una \u00f3pera prima que ha puesto patas arriba el g\u00e9nero de acci\u00f3n con su potente e impresionante violencia extrema ligada al humor.El viaje es el de siempre: alguien hace algo malo a una inocente, el p\u00fablico se pone de parte de la v\u00edctima, y esta vuelve muy cabreada a devolver golpes. De eso se trata. Coraline Fargeat cambia varios paradigmas de este g\u00e9nero atiborr\u00e1ndolo de un estilo visual poderoso, aporta a su protagonista una sensibilidad femenina y llena de talento su proceso de transformaci\u00f3n de manera simb\u00f3lica y expresionista, dando m\u00e1s importancia a las sensaciones que a lo que realmente est\u00e1 pasando. Aqu\u00ed yacen los verdaderos valores de la obra, en c\u00f3mo arruinar la vida de unos miserables con estilo propio y un crecimiento en el personaje de Jen (Matilda Lutz), excelentemente contado de forma progresiva y seg\u00fan las necesidades de la historia y del propio g\u00e9nero.Revenge posee la esencia del western con toques de cine gore y secuencias tan excesivamente grotescas que acaban haci\u00e9ndote re\u00edr. Una obra magn\u00edfica que, m\u00e1s que otras, merece la pena ver en la gran pantalla por su magn\u00edfico montaje, en el que tambi\u00e9n ha participado la propia directora, y la excepcional direcci\u00f3n de fotograf\u00eda de Robrecht Heyvaert.\u201cLas mujeres siempre ten\u00e9is que plantar cara\u201d, grita embadurnado de sangre uno de los antagonistas de esta pel\u00edcula mientras agarra del cuello a Jen, ese monstruo convertido en una nueva hero\u00edna moderna gracias a la directora Coraline Fargeat."

      "text": "Revenge is directed and written by Coralie Fargeat and starring Matilda Anna Ingrid Lutz, Kevin Janssens and Vincent Colombe.The whole story is about Jen (fearlessly embodied by Matilda Lutz, Rings) is enjoying a romantic getaway with her wealthy boyfriend which is suddenly disrupted when his sleazy friends arrive for an unannounced hunting trip. Tension mounts in the house until the situation abruptly--and viciously--intensifies, culminating in a shocking act that leaves Jen left for dead. Unfortunately for her assailants, Jen survives and reemerges with a relentless, wrathful intent: revenge.As an hour and 48 minutes movie, the story was fine. It wasn't that shocking or surprising one, I mean if you watched the trailer before watching the movie, you will figure out the whole story.I went to watch Revenge and I know that it's not gonna be nothing less or more than just a dump movie, but it did surprise me, with its way of vengeance, performances and the places of filming.OK, the story was really lite, nothing awesome about it, it was just okay. But -and there must be a but- the direction blow the whole thing up, with a terrible soundtrack, the presentation went ridiculous! The first act (the plot) was good, enough as presenting the story and the characters. The second act (the beginning of Jen's transformation) was good as the middle chapter. The third act (the finale) was super-predictable, but still entertaining.The performances were really good, especially Matilda Lutz, I can't wait to see her having her own action high-budget movie.The places of filming were really catching, but once again the direction blew the whole thing up.. Coralie Fargeat, please, don't direct any other movie again!And now, the most over-made thing is the blood, it's not only brutal, it was totally unscientific, and the whole movie is unscientific! Those are the issues I found in Revenge, and the good things too.I'm gonna give Revenge a B+.Okay, guys, thank you as always for reading, and please, let me know what do you think about my reviews."

Where it falls apart is when a grievous wound is miraculously fixed with some warm metal and a pump-action shotgun is used as a long range rifle. This is an obvious attempt to draw female fans by making the lead be able to survive a complete impaling, multiple gunshots, and further injuries whereas all of the others characters die rather easily and carelessly."
