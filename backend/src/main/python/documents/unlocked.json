      "text": "While the topical British thriller \u201cUnlocked\u201d is neither as entertaining nor as evenly paced as other films in the espionage genre, it makes up some ground with a story that is absorbing and twisty."

      "text": "Unlocked is your run-of-the-mill let\u2019s save the city with one second left on the clock popcorn movie. Predictable to say the least, it ticks all the boxes under terrorist/conspiracy/biological attack etc, etc. Could not be more generic even if it tried. The plot is so unimaginative you\u2019re always two steps ahead of everything that\u2019s happening. This is not helped by every single bad guy completely bursting with a shady presence and practically glaring through the camera directly at you. Noomi Rapace is better than this, Orlando Bloom is lucky to even be here and as for Michael Douglas and John Malkovich well they\u2019re just here for the paycheque. Not the worst thing you\u2019ll ever watch but it drifts in and out of a boring story you\u2019ll find the end can\u2019t come quick enough.Not recommended unless you really have nothing better to do with your time. I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m providing a public service by watching these bad movies so you don\u2019t have to. You\u2019re welcome."

      "text": "Unlocked makes use of an excellent cast in this interesting if predictable spy thriller. Rapace in particular had me engaged from the get go, but Unlocked failed to capture my imagination in the same way as other better examples of the genre. Worth a watch for sure!"

      "rating": "4",
      "text": "Dull and predictable scenario with very poor and tiring editing. Great actors in a bad criminal movie which are common lately. It is a pity that such poor film with five leading actors appeared in theaters."

      "rating": "7",
      "text": "Trailer gives away a bit too much, I watched without remembering what happened in the trailer and it was a bit more interesting to me, the first half of the movie in my opinion was quite intereesting and there were no problems with pace for me, but the second part and the conclusion was just so messy and it felt like they resolved everything the easiest and most predictable way possible. Still, in my opinion a good movie."

      "text": "Noomi Rapace en tourne des films et on est bien content pour elle, car nous l'appr\u00e9cions tout-\u00e0-fait... mais elle tourne quand m\u00eame un peu trop de merdes et j'ai comme l'impression qu'elle devient un Statham au f\u00e9minin.Pourtant, ce \"Conspiracy\" commen\u00e7ait bien, comme un film typique d'une chasse aux islamo-terros (toujours en train de comploter des saloperies) avec Noomi sur le coup ainsi que son mentor, Papy Douglas (eh oui, d\u00e9j\u00e0...) et Malkovich qui cabotine le minimum syndical (mais un vieux, faut que \u00e7a mange...). Mais Papy ne dure pas tr\u00e8s longtemps, car la conspiration s\u00e9vit \u00e0 plein r\u00e9gime... sauf qu'on n'y pige rien \u00e0 ce foutoir.Le MI5 et la CIA semblent se tirer la bourre (de fa\u00e7on carr\u00e9ment violente... lol ?) tandis qu'un m\u00e9chant terroriste blanc (et converti, soit) veut empoisonner le monde... d'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, l'Imam est un gars tout gentil, la main sur le coeur et tout et tout... On dirait bien un film de gauchistes qui nous prend pour des cons mais surtout un film qui n'a aucune id\u00e9e de ce qu'il est en train de faire : la confusion qui couche avec l'invraisemblable et se conjugue au grand n'importe quoi : Tom Clancy dans les cordes !Putain mais quelle daube, ce truc !"
