Now after watching the trailers and seeing all the people who were involved, it goes without saying that I was quite interested.But it happens that those expectations are often not met.The Devil All the Time is not what you could say a bad film, but it's a mixture that's very, very messy.The way all the narratives are connected is far from coherent and this is because the main goal, which in my opinion is to show the evil inside the characters (The reason for the movie title) never feels immersive and more than anything, because the characters aren't deeply explored even when they seem to have incredible backgrounds stories.The film never opts for that option and only comes down to presenting an interesting story yes, but unfortunately also very messy.The cast does their job and among all of them there's none that really stands out but that as I said is more because the script doesn't give them anything to explore, they just have enough to present themselves.And I say this because of all the people involved, the only one who shows that he can finally go elsewhere is Tom Holland, because from there, all the main actors are already proven actors, so thanks to them the film manages to remain stable.I firmly believe that audiences can give it a chance, but you also have to admit when this standard just doesn't make films worthy of being remembered."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Totally engrossing, character driven drama with amazing performances across the board.

Tem cenas bem elaboradas e uma boa fotografia. \"Engata\" da metade pro final e cria uma tens\u00e3o gostosa, inerente aos personagens pela imprevisibilidade mas presentes conosco.Dito isso, deixo claro que gostei do filme, mas algumas coisas me incomodaram, mais no cunho pessoal mesmo. Primeiro de tudo: os arqu\u00e9tipos dos religiosos fan\u00e1ticos. Eu entendo o argumento sobre a cr\u00edtica a religi\u00e3o e tudo mais, por\u00e9m, a obra n\u00e3o cria um equil\u00edbrio fact\u00edvel entre personagens \"bons e ruins\". Quase todo mundo no filme \u00e9 um maldito sem alma, e por conta disso, n\u00e3o parece nem um pouco veross\u00edmil. Acaba que a cr\u00edtica perde o prop\u00f3sito e sua for\u00e7a quanto a influ\u00eancia a realidade do expectador.Os di\u00e1logos expositivos tamb\u00e9m me incomodaram bastante. O voice-over quebrou minha imers\u00e3o no filme v\u00e1rias vezes. Quando havia uma cena onde poder\u00edamos nos habituar, ou tentar entender o que se passa pela cabe\u00e7a do personagem, a narra\u00e7\u00e3o interrompe EXPLICANDO TUDO. E o pior \u00e9 que em diversos momentos a situa\u00e7\u00e3o j\u00e1 ficou clara. Ao inv\u00e9s de construir um plot ou deixar em branco - sem o fator replay; falar foi mesmo a melhor op\u00e7\u00e3o? A cena da aram descarregada \u00e9 a prova que isso n\u00e3o d\u00e1 certo. Fora alguns flashbacks completamente desnecess\u00e1rios.No que se diz respeito a atua\u00e7\u00f5es, estou satisfeito. Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, Tom Holland e Robert Pattinson estavam excelentes, dando alma aos personagens e criando cenas maravilhosas. Harry Melling tamb\u00e9m estava bem, mesmo exagerando num momento ou outro.Como conclus\u00e3o, eu gostei do filme, mas tive a sensa\u00e7\u00e3o de que tudo \u00e9 t\u00e3o na cara que a profundidade se perde completamente. Logo, do in\u00edcio ao final eu tinha certeza de que o que eu estava vendo era um filme escrito por algu\u00e9m. Os personagens n\u00e3o parecem reais, muito menos suas ang\u00fastias, medos, etc. As conveni\u00eancias foram demais pra mim e a cr\u00edtica a religi\u00e3o e outros aspectos \u00e9 t\u00e3o for\u00e7ada que perde a credibilidade, principalmente pelo fato dos personagens n\u00e3o sa\u00edrem muitos dos seus respectivos arqu\u00e9tipos. Fora a narra\u00e7\u00e3o e os di\u00e1logos expositivos.

Um pai que \u00e9 preconceituoso pode acabar passando esse preconceito para o filho que vai passar para o neto e assim por diante. E \u00e9 muito interessante ver todo esse conceito em tela, mas usando a viol\u00eancia como a heran\u00e7a. Elemento que \u00e9 usado no filme de forma literal quando um dos personagens ganha uma arma que era do pai.  Mas o interessante \u00e9 que aqui n\u00e3o observamos a viol\u00eancia como s\u00f3 uma heran\u00e7a de fam\u00edlia, e sim da sua semente que aqui est\u00e1 representado com o final da segunda guerra mundial e todas as feridas deixadas nos sobreviventes. Uma semente que fez muitas pessoas se agarrarem muito mais na f\u00e9 em Deus, acabaram se tornando fan\u00e1ticas e usando dessa f\u00e9 para promover mais viol\u00eancia e consequentemente tamb\u00e9m deixando seus filhos violentos. O que torna toda essa passagem de tempo e como as influ\u00eancias do passado na nova gera\u00e7\u00e3o um dos pontos mais interessantes de assistir do longa.  Claro, com toda essa tem\u00e1tica, o filme tem cenas um tanto fortes, o que \u00e9 mostrado pelo diretor com naturalidade, afinal de contas o mal rodeia aqueles personagens, logo ela se torna algo quase trivial dentro da l\u00f3gica visual do filme. Ele nunca deixa o gore como ponto principal da cena, tornando um efeito de desconforto forte no p\u00fablico.  O longa nos apresenta diversas hist\u00f3rias e todas s\u00e3o muito bem amarradas. Gosto de como ele usa a ironia de alguns encontros, algumas que s\u00f3 n\u00f3s do p\u00fablico sabemos. Mas \u00e9 ineg\u00e1vel que o personagem do Sebastian Stan tem uma subtrama que n\u00e3o serve muito bem a hist\u00f3ria, o personagem dele podia ter menos cenas. Mas todo o elenco est\u00e1 \u00f3timo, com um destaque pra Tom Holland que aposta em um papel mais s\u00e9rio e n\u00e3o deixa a desejar e Robert Pattinson que chega a dar nojo de t\u00e3o bem que est\u00e1.  Durante o filme sentimos raiva, desconforto, nojo e temos umas sequ\u00eancias que nos deixam nervosos, principalmente as que envolvem o Tom Holland. O Longa tem seus momentos que poderiam ser encurtados, mas nada que afete demais a experi\u00eancia. Um baita filme que me fez refletir sobre o que eu vou passar adiante e se isso vai ser ben\u00e9fico ou n\u00e3o.

Tom Holland is freaking ridiculous in his performance, as is Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd. You can see the rage and pain within them throughout their time on screen. There are some weaker characters, and some slower sections, but to see how they (and the sins they represent) intertwine over the film's otherwise lengthy duration, is well worth your time. As a bonus, the music is subtle yet haunting at parts, and in an interesting dichotomy, beautiful and hopeful during some of the darkest scenes. I was really gripped throughout the score."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Holland and Pattinson do very well with their limited screen time but let's be honest people, This movie is a narrative mess with events loosely tied together in a very unappealing and unsatisfying way. The flow of the movie: Here's some vague out of sequence event, followed by a violent (or implied violent) act and followed up the events immediately following said act and then another out of sequence event.It seems like the director relied too heavily on the cast and the attempts of shock value rather than delivering a more solid narrative that closely tied these events together.

If you like good dogs, watch it."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "The Devil All the Time - 8/10 (Maybe 7.5, can't honestly decide)The Devil All the Time reminded me a lot of The Place Between the Pines but darker and more violent - and mixed a little with Lawless. It's a story that tells mirroring story arches of a father (Bill Skarsgard) and his son (Tom Holland); unlike The Place Between the Pines however, the emphasis is put on the son rather than the father which is to the film's detriment a little. Not a lot (see my rating) but I found myself enamored with Skarsgard's performance as well as his plot more than with Holland's acting and plot. Both are good, but I wish the father was more of the focus in the film. But that is only a minor complaint as I enjoyed both parts of the movie.For the most part the acting is great; Skarsgard especially steals the show but Harry Melling is also surprisingly superb. I say \"surprisingly\" only because I have not seen him since his turn as Dudley in the Harry Potter franchise and was not aware how talented of an actor he is. Jason Clarke and Sebastian Stan also put in great work and although I am not particularly a fan of Holland or Pattinson's work they were not distracting in their performances. Although, you could argue they were distracting as it was plain they were cast in this film to try to broaden the audience of a film that would likely have been merely a cult classic (and honestly, most likely still will be regardless.)This film is dark and twisted and certainly will not win any award for \"Feel Good Movie of the Year\" and is more of a character study. But in all honesty it is not much of a character study either as it remains fairly shallow in its study of the characters. So what is it then? It's a story of what happened between these interconnected characters at this point in time - the writers and director do not tell you what to make of it but instead challenge you to make of it what you will. A strategy that I am intrigued by personally, but rarely works among the masses. At least the general audience members in America.That is why I deem this movie to be more of a cult classic than a hit with the general public or even critics; from its dark subject matter to slow-burn pacing and lastly its ambiguity it will not draw in a large crowd. But those who are drawn in just might become obsessed with this movie."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Es tensa, inquietante y dram\u00e1tica, adem\u00e1s tiene una historia que logra interesar al espectador."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "MASTERPIECE !!!!!!!!!!!! 100/10 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Another film that drags on way to long.

For starters, I wish there could be more said about this film from me, cause I found myself thoroughly underwhelmed with the film as a whole. The pacing, editing, and narrative just weren't satisfactory for me, as the film jumps back and forth between past and present at somewhat random times, and despite being based off a novel, the story still felt remarkably lacking and uninspired to me. Throw in some clunky narration and you get a film that definitely feels more tailor made for Netflix rather than theaters. This isn't to say that there weren't some pros as well. Holland gives what I'd easily consider to be his best and most mature performance to date, for once finally shedding his Spider-Man image. The all-star cast does a great job here, but apart from Holland, the other big standout here is Robert Pattinson as a corrupt preacher that Holland finds himself face to face with. Overall, the film does feel like it simply borrows a lot from similar past films that deal with a western backwoods setting ('Lawless' is one such film that comes to mind for me), but what the film lacks in story and originality it more or less makes up for in its all-star cast and their performances."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Sinister characters converge around a young man devoted to protecting those he loves in a postwar backwoods town teeming with corruption and brutality.First and foremost, this movie IS NOT for the faint of heart. Its extremely violent, bleak and twisted and dark, they really pulled no punches with this movie. The Devil All The Time is a slow burning tale set in a rural post war backwoods town. I never read the book but the real draw here is obviously the extremely large cast of box office stars, all superb in their roles. I was especially impressed with Tom Holland here, who really brings it in a role I've never seen him partake in before.All in all, this a dark and disturbing film that's only real downside in my opinion happens to be its jumbled narrative. People will obviously complain about the pacing and the array of terrible characters in this that makes it an uneasy film to sit through. But thats what makes it a real gem in my opinion.

Certain plot points in the movie feel rushed as if it was a check in the box and not something the Director cared a lot about it. It was a lot worse in the first 45 minutes because everything happens so fast that it\u2019s hard to care about some of these characters. Once Tom Holland shows up though, the film gets drastically better. Tom Holland does an excellent job here and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed his performance.

Robert Pattinson is excellent as always and he did a really good southern accent here. This is definitely a Top 5 performance from him but not my personal favorite. Everyone else here did a good job but it was harder to care about their characters than Holland, Skarsg\u00e5rd, and Pattinson.

Or any surprising events after 5-10min.This is definitely a good movie, maybe great but while I really enjoyed the ride, I still can't understand how a movie so packed with events could feel so long. I definitely think it's worthwhile but it doesn't feel like one I would enjoy a second go with. The darkness is well portrayed, not very graphic but enough to get uncomfortable and the imagination fills in what's not shown, so that depending on how accustomed to real dark plots you are, it adapts smoothly. But it felt a bit afraid to actually let the viewer take in and reflect since it moves on sometimes way to quickly. While it's a more realistic and easy to understand and predict to cause many surprises, the acting and impressive way it ties together a red thread of almost thin air. It's not a mind blowing story but still worth a view. And that's the issue, I can't imagine enjoying or finding much new perspective, it's dark for sure but lacks depth. Though given that \"Joker\" was to violent dark or whatever it was for some audience not to long ago, I feel like the sadness of it all at points become over bearing but still not rly thought provoking. It's not as tragic as the packaging makes it, it's simple and while hard to forget. No questions remains once we reach the end. It doesn't deal with many Grey areas. It's a good story but more like a tale of evil then a tragedy that invites reflection. The characters are simple, unpure but it lacks that depth, it's sad but very straight forward. Evil - tragedy but most characters or their motives are explained to much to make me feel for them most of the time. Pattinson is great at being evil but it's so on the nose that it makes the characters around look clueless. Comparing it to say, Fate Zero or Code Geass it's not actually that tragic, it's not much character development so the acting might be great, but it's also straightforward in what role they have. While it might be to dark for some, I feel it's almost cartoonish in how evil is portrayed by Pattinson, looks good but but since you never really get to think about much, Skarsg\u00e5rd was the only one whose character didn't feel one dimensional. It ends decently but while it is full of just sadness brought by evil, it's not rly time, room or need to reflect, it's sad and evil However I can't tell what is missing from it, but when I think about my favorite tragedies, typically anime I feel like the time to fullt dwelve deeper"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This movie is all about Tom Holland, he showed that he is not just a superhero, he is the superhero.
