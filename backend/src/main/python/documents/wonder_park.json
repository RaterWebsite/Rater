      "text": "I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I believe it has a great message about the darkness in our lives. A fun, complex (for a kids film at least) main character in June. Lots of great voice acting by people like John Oliver. Kids will love the colorfulness while the angst ridden teens can love the story about dealing with tough dark times in life."

      "text": "It might look great with nice animation and visuals, but everything else in this movie is so bland, generic, clich\u00e9, uncreative and forgettable. June, the main character is so unlikeable that makes me stop caring about anything in the movie. The rest of the characters are bland and one-note. The movie is filled with really bad and clich\u00e9 dialogue, hit or miss jokes, like I laughed like twice the whole movie (I hated the porcupine character, he was so annoying and nothing he said made me laugh) and it feels like the movie didn't have any stakes, no tension, no danger, nothing. The emotional moments aren't emotional at all and feel forced. The pacing is really bad, like, I actually felt like the movie was too short! I mean it is far from the worst animated movie of the year (That title goes to Uglydolls or The Lion King, at least so far) but it is actually one of the most disappointing, because it had potential, in fact, the first trailer looked promising! Overall, mediocre movie, with a despicable main character, bland characters, abundance of clich\u00e9s, dull story, but at least the animation looked great."

Let\u2019s start by pointing out the generic story points in this awful movie - this \u201cmovie\u201d is about Judy, a bland Corline look-a-like trying to use her creativity to make A inmaginary Theme Park - her dream literally destroys the entire neighborhood in the process- the Mother gets sick (but doesn\u2019t die)I\u2019m gonna stop here. This movie is a pure insult to everyone involved. The movie wasted GREAT actors who I love:Matthew Broderick, Jennifer Gardener and Mila Kunis are all phenomenal actors in a pure trash movieThe movie is very mean spirited and depressing. It was hard for me to get through this movie. The only reason I rated it a 1 instead of a 0 is because the visuals DO look nice"

      "text": "It was okay. Nothing really all that original. The movie suffers in it's pacing and drastic changes in the mood. We go from a mother and daughter bonding, to the daughter being reckless and not understand the difference of fantasy and reality, to a clich\u00e9 plot about the mother being ill and the daughter unable to cope with it, to a camping movie, and finally to a movie about saving this amusement park in which the daughter finds out is real... at least it might be?Also, why is the name of the movie \"Wonder Park\" whenever the actually amusement park is called \"Wonderland\"? Is it because they forgot that Alice was a thing and they didn't want people to mistake this as just another retelling of Lewis Caroll's 1865 novel?"

      "text": "This movie... sucked!!! I can't believe I used to like this ever since I was 19 years old, but nowadays ever since March 26, 2021, I fricking hate it! It's a piece of monkey poop! Getting on to June Bailey! Oh my god, she's so annoying and she's a brat! I cannot stand her being so unlikable like this! The title of this movie is so misleading, because the movie's title is called Wonder Park, but in the whole movie itself, the amusement park that June made is called Wonderland! Mediocre character development, unfunny humor, terrible comedy, predictable story, and uninteresting plot! But the only good things about this movie is the good animation, great voice acting (despite talents being wasted), and good soundtrack by Steven Price. Overall, this movie is so boring, disappointing, a waste of time, and it's the worst animated film of 2019 next to Arctic Dogs and The Addams Family (the CGI version)! And also, this movie can get sent to the Darkness where it belongs! I give it a 1 out of 10! The end!"
