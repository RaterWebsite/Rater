This movie, sadly, is more accurate than I'd like to admit when it comes to what people these days do during the holidays.  Being with those closest to you such as friends and family is the only thing I can pull from this movie that is of any worth.  What happened to families being together, appreciating one another, and even making it a point to be in a church service on a holiday that used to be regarded as religious? Now, all that seems to be desired is to get together, party, and goof off.  It seems to me that our culture needs to get its priorities back in line and this movie is the exact opposite of what our nation needs.

Sure, some scenes are funny, and some are just hilarious, but most of the movie is only there to make a reasonable runtime."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "(In carolling tone) Twas the night before Christmas and all was in order, then three childhood friends, with some drugs and some booze, brought much disorder.\r Some of my favourite Christmas movies of all time range from scared and helpless little boys stuck in the big apple, to a grown-up elf stuck in the big city, to an under appreciative working man looking back at the good in his life and the world as a whole. Christmas is always a joyous, overfilling and highly commercialized time of year with some redeeming life lessons mixed in for good measure. So it came to be a big surprise for me that, The Night Before, one of my new favourite Christmas movies of all time, brought something new to the holiday movie genre we have never seen before; narcotics, sex and a threesome bromance we haven\u2019t seen this good since the early Apatow films.\r TNB1\r The premise is simple, the movie centers on three very different friends; Ethan, Isaac and Chris (played perfectly by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Seth Rogen and Anthony Mackie, respectively) who start a new boys night Christmas eve tradition after the tragic passing of Ethan\u2019s parents by a drunk driver. What starts off as a simple tradition of getting drunk, egg drop soup, a visit to the Rockefeller Centre Christmas Tree, and of course, like any good Rogen and company film, getting completely high and f*cked up, quickly turns into a search for the ultimate party. After a couple of years perfecting their Christmas shenanigans, the trio get wind of an epic and secretive Nutcracker Ball (think Great Gatsby-esque type shindig), that only happens by invite and to a very exclusive bunch. Unable to find the actual party for many years, the three give up and eventually mutually decide to end the tradition, seeing that Isaac is in the midst of having a baby and family, Chris and his high cost of success and fame as a football star, and all three moving on and getting too old.\r One of the best aspects of The Night Before, much like the previous Rogen/Gordon-Levitt collaboration 50/50 is the film\u2019s fantastic ability to be silly, wild and completely chaotic, yet maintain a very emotional and deep connection of friendship, love and a believable bromance between three highly unlikely and different people. New to the Rogen crew this time around is Anthony Mackie (you may know him as Falcon in the Marvel universe), a very talented and versatile actor, who gathers as many laughs as Rogen and Gordon-Levitt within all of his scenes.\r Rogen, who is hysterical as always, uses his very apparent Jewish roots and heritage for the basis of his humor and the foundation of many laughs throughout. From foreshadowing a very symbolic crucifixion, to some hilarious blasphemous religious gags within or outside of the church, hilarious bar scenarios, and ultimately to one of my favourite dinner texting scene ever in a film, Rogen always brings the laughs to a maximum.\r TNB\r Gordon-Levitt, the cute and cuddly of the bunch, brings many nostalgic moments of friendship that really hold the emotional core of the film. Having recently suffered a break-up with his ex Diana (Lizzy Caplan), Ethan is easily the most lost of the bunch; roaming through dead end jobs (like serving hors d\u2019oeuvres on Christmas eve dressed up as an elf), being an unheard musical talent and not doing much with it, to living alone while Chris grows professionally and Isaac as a father and husband, Ethan gains much of the holiday empathy we are so used to chucking around this time of year.\r While The Night Before is surely an acquired taste for many, the movie aims for a mostly young demographic overall. My parents wouldn\u2019t be the people I\u2019d recommend the film to, especially given the very strong hints of marijuana flooding the theatre, The Night Before proves to be a perfect buddy holiday cinema-going experience from beginning to end.\r Like any good Rogen and company film, the film is filled with unexpected and sometimes utterly perfect cameos and roles for some amazing actors, including Michael Shannon (Man of Steel), who plays Mr. Green, the boys\u2019 drug dealer and whimsically mysterious entity; to Jillian Bell (22 Jump Street), who plays Rogen\u2019s wife and drug supplier for the group, to Miley Cyrus who rings in a great cameo and fantastic little over-the top scene, to Mindy Kaling, Jason Jones, Jason Mantzoukas, Randall Park (The Interview) and Tracy Morgan after his very public and publicized car accident.\r TNB0\r As we grow older and stressed, Christmas is never really our thing, whether or not we believe in the holiday at all. Between the commercial onslaughts, to the joyous overkill, the holidays become more of a dreaded family melodrama more than anything. Thankfully, The Night Before is a perfect way to counteract all your holidays blues, while still staying in the Christmas spirit."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "The standard for over-the top gross out comedy is the payoff worth the defilement? For example: after seeing a mail-it-in Sandler-esque movie, one simply feels violated (especially in the pocketbook and timebank; ie: could have scheduled a colonoscopy instead.) In this uneven but hilarious romp, Seth Rogen rants & steals his way to some of the all time classic scenes, that places his performance and the movie's other shenanigans amongst the all-time Bad Santa-like class(less) holiday staples."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Not your typical Christmas movie, but what a howl.  Along the lines of \"Bad Santa\" it's irreverent.  But I need some contrast to the usual Christmas movies (Scrooge, 34th Street, etc.)  And as usual, putting the 3 amigos (Gordon-Levitt, Rogan, and Franco) together makes for a raunchy, joke filled, sexual innuendo packed movie.  And the supporting actors play it straight, like it's a real Christmas movie, which makes it even funnier.  Don't know why everyone gave it such low ratings, or maybe I'm weird."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "The Night Before was one of the films I was the most excited about for late in 2015. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Seth Rogen reunite with Jonathan Levine, the director of 50/50 which was an excellent film. Levitt stars in the second of three films to be released this year as he has been working hard and expanding his acting range with dramatic performances in The Walk and Snowden later this year.\r The writing for The Night Before was better than I thought it would be and there is some emotional parts in the movie and you never really feel like this movie solely exists to make you laugh. You can connect with the three friends in Rogen, Levitt and Mackie all of which have their own struggles in life that they have to deal with throughout the night. There is also a character Mr. Green, played by Michael Shannon, that has some significance that you would never notice at the start of the film, but his role in the film becomes more and more noticeable as the film goes on and in the end you get a very interesting reveal.\r The thing that brought The Night Before down a little was the humour. There were several scenes in the film that were really, really funny but it was not consistently funny like Neighbours was last year. I\u2019m sure that there will be people that will find this movie to be one of the funniest this year but to me some of the humour just didn\u2019t catch. There are some cool cameos to watch for that are pretty funny though and that makes the film even more enjoyable.\r All together I enjoyed the Night Before and although it may not be considered a \u201cclassic\u201d holiday comedy I can see myself watching this one over again at Christmas time in the future."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "This movie offered a lot of laughs and you can't help but cheer on to hear the next joke. The Night Before is not Seth Rogens best, but it's still a good time.

And I liked it, It offers good laughs."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "The purist goal for a comedy is to make the audience laugh, and it succeeds at doing that. It helps that each of the characters played by Gordon-Levitt, Rogen and Mackie are all likable characters, with problems that any average person could relate to. My only problem with the story is the lack of backstory for any character, even the main character. We get the jist of why he is the way he is, but there's another aspect that I feel was completely skipped over. Nonetheless, it's a funny movie with good spirit."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "\"The Night Before\" is   a   great   theater   experience   with   tons   of   laughs, heart,   and holiday cheer.

Genuinely, this movie ticked all the boxes I look for in a Christmas film and spoof as well as a dramedie. The references to Christmas traditions blend in so well with overall dismissal of tradition so you can move on with your life is perfect, I guess a couple flaws may come from the fact that there were some conflicting elements in the abruptness being good and bad from Joseph Gordon Levitt's character, and the abusal of drug jokes (Seth Rogen....so it HAS to be included....).

That's not to say it's not loaded with sex, drugs and vomit ( it has all three) but there are layers of genuine emotion that play out as an almost Dickensian holiday fable.\r If you're looking for some genuine laughs to offset the horror of your family this holiday season, this movie won't disappoint."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "It's The Hangover for the holiday season.
