Quitting is not an option, so, with the benefit of a few-too-many drinks and some dubious advice from a hustling ex-con, the three friends devise a convoluted and seemingly foolproof plan to rid themselves of their respective employers... permanently.",

I didn't feel like I was a little kid getting read a story like I have with the past few comedies I have seen.  Jason Sudekis, Charlie Day and Jason Bateman are very funny together.  You have the Player (Sudekis), the Mature One (Bateman) and the Crazy (Day) much like the Hangover.  Very watchable and very funny. 8 out of 10"

Instead of relying of gross-out gags and over-the-top outrageousness, this film features genuinely funny characters and situations. The leading trio have great comic chemistry and their non-stop banter provides most of the laughs. The bad guys are obviously having lots of fun, too. This film won't break any new ground (although it may launch Charlie Day's big screen stardom), but it's energy will certainly keep you amused."

I honor this film for the several laughs that it got out of me, but by the end, I found myself ready to move on to something with more lofty comedic goals.  Easily worth your matinee admission price, but be a bit cautious if you are considering paying full evening admission price on this movie.  This is the kind of movie that Saturday night cable premieres were made for, in my opinion."

With a reasonably interesting and silly plot, it manages to keep the audience entertained, while not being overly diluted and stupid, like many comedies nowadays are. There are never really dull moments in the film, and the action is ever-present, which provides for good entertainment. What I really enjoyed are the supporting performances, actually. I thought they were amazing - much better than the leads. That being said, Charlie Day is the cutest thing around and I could watch him for hours. But Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey and Colin Farrell all do amazing jobs. Aniston is perfect as the kinky, sexy, sex-crazed maniac boss, and should definitely experiment some more with characters like these. Farrell reminds me of Tom Cruise in \"Tropic Thunder\" - same look, same crazy, same good performance. Overall, the performances are the really fun, surprising factor here, making the film truly fun and entertaining! Definitely fun to watch!"

I guess if u were disappointed with Hangover 2 like i was you should appreciate this movie. Solid film, Great actors. Charlie Day is amazing. When you go see this movie, enjoy it for what it is, a hilarious comedy. Don't go in there expecting it to be like something else, do the comparing after u watch the movie. Just sit and enjoy."

An ensemble cast that coukdnt have been cast better with all characters taking on their roles brilliantly. But two actors that stand out against the rest of the cast is Charlie Day and Jennifer Aniston, they have excellent chemistry together, and As soon as both appear on screen together you know sparks will fly. Jennifer Aniston is outstanding in a role no one would have expected, with her dirty talk and sexual ways, she is different and excellent at it. Her role could either be a one off or the start of a brilliant new acting route for her. But above all is Charlie Day, every scene he is in is hilarious, and you would seriously believe this is what Charlies real life persona is like. Its hard to describe how execellent and hilarious he is in the film without watching it for yourself. The only bad points of this film is it is not consistently funny, nor a plot that is by the end very intruging or memorable. But overall a truly fantastic comedy film that pretty much everyone could enjoy, just dont watch with your parents or grandparents!"

It's just not substantial enough to be considered a classic that can sit along side your Old Schools, Hangovers, or Wedding Crashers.  But it's much better than Hall Pass! Charlie Day seems to be making every movie he's in better. Makes me fired up for another season of It's Always Sunny. And Jennifer Aniston? I love that she goes all the way and really commits to these roles.  I know she had a brief period in her career when some other celeb broke up with her?  Who was that, Brad Pitt?  Pffft!  The days of our needing to feel sorry for her are long over.  She's destroying it. Look forward to her next film."

He's so psycho that he scares you. Hopefully nobody will have that type of monster has a boss. But the movie had a lot of focus on this character (and stand out the most from all the horrible bosses). I would of liked to see a little bit more situations involving Dr. Julia Harris, D.D.S. (Jennifer Aniston) and Bobby Pellitt (Colin Farrell). Especially Jennifer Aniston, she was hot. In fact, I would like to had her has a boss. Anyway, the filmmakers did a great job creating theses characters. Has for our heroes, they were hilarious. It was fun to watch these normal people trying to kill there bosses, and failing at it. It's an enjoyable movie, I was waiting to see this for a long time and it didn't disappointed me."

Everyone sells their roles perfectly here, particularly Charlie Day and Jennifer Aniston. The script isn't bad either. There's a number of memorable quotes and fun situations to keep this movie going. The one big weak point is the concept itself, and that causes the laughs to diminish a bit, but just as the movie starts to sink, there's an inspired performance to bring it back up.

      "text": "From Arrested Development creator, Brett Ratner, and the star of Freaks  Geeks, John Francis Daly, comes Horrible Bosses. What made this film stand out from other raunchy comedies, was that there wasn't just one super funny guy that the other played off of. Every character had their moment and was funny in their own way. The story was fairly original too. Three miserable guys decide all their problems would end if they kill each other's boss and they go on a hilarious mission to get the job done. While I love the idea and thought the movie was genuinely funny, what it lacks is character development. Other than the abuses they face at work, you don't really know too much about these guys and where they are coming from. I feel like that weakened the film, but what more than makes up for it is a ton of hilarious cameos. I love cameos and there are some great ones from Jennifer Aniston, Jamie Foxx, Donald Sutherland, Bob Newhart, and Collin  Farrell. Horrible Bosses while lacking substance is defiantly good for a few laughs, which is pretty much all that I expect from these types of movies."

Jason Bateman and Charlie Day rule while Spacey and Aniston(surprisingly Aniston honestly)really bring it home.  The guy from SNL wasn't bad but really reminded me of Ed Helms only Day has the more frantic parts.  Both Bateman and Spacey are so brilliant with how deadpan they are... which makes Day's frantic, hilarious character that's quite similar to Charlie on It's Always Sunny but a tad smarter and not the raging drunk that that character is.
