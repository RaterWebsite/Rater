He has transformed from captain Phillips to captain Sully. Another great addition to Clint Eastwood's filmography as well, he never disappoints us. This film was based on the real event of the January 15, 2009. When a US passenger plane got hit by birds just after the take off, losing both the engines, landed on the New York's Hudson river. So the film reveals the heroic event, as well as followed by the investigation of the crash landing.As it is a Hollywood film what should I expect, another American bravery? Yep, but still a good film, very engaging plot. It's not all about the plane event, because I thought one of the film poster is a spoiler. So the film covers more story, about the drama surrounding the main event. Especially saving the lives, that inspires even for the outside Americans. The entire narration is about two-three day affair, but most of the film was about the crash landing. From the actors to the visuals, all were top class. One of the best biopic that's not based on one's whole life, but one heroic attempt which will be remembered him and this film for forever.8/10"

      "text": "I must say, I was impressed with Sully. These based on real dramas are so easy to mess up, dropping into the same cliched scenes and dialogue. Clint Eastwood is a talented director who knows when to use less, and who is better at communicating through so little dialogue like Tom Hanks? His best roles focus on seeing situations through his eyes and this is no exception. Aaron Eckhart, as always, does a fantastic job holding that second strong role. The non linear approach was also critical to keeping the story from falling flat, by giving us scattered bits and pieces of a disaster that was over in less than three minutes throughout the film. I thought there were a few too many could-have-been flashbacks that took away from the narrative, but that's my only real gripe."

It is a terrifically detailed but slow moving work by 86 year old living legend Clint Eastwood starring the Jimmy Stewart/everyman of our era, in two time - should have been three time -Oscar winner Tom Hanks as the quietly unheroic hero pilot. (You were robbed of the statuette in 2000 for \"Cast Away\", Tom. Who else could play opposite a volleyball for two hours and make it work?).I'm reminded of Eastwood's 2003 Academy Award winning \"Mystic River\" in that he deliberately takes his time in adapting the book, as he does here as well. The script is a little odd, shifting back and forth between the events of the day itself and the hearing to decide whether the pilot and co-pilot were at fault for not heading to one of the nearby airports. This leads to a little awkwardness during the first third of the film, but then works out just fine. We see the big event twice - The epic landing of the jet is more than worth seeing in and of itself.Aaron Eckhart, for once, gets to play a good guy, the co-pilot. How nice to see Delphi Harrington, a much underused actress, as the passenger in the wheelchair. She was marvelous as an intelligent, sophisticated woman in the long-gone soap opera Where the Heart Is and was also believable as a trashy Southern murderess on Guiding Light and as a trashy Southern prostitute on All My Children. Here she plays a somewhat stereotypical New York Jewish mother. As a daughter she gets Valerie Mehaffey of Desperate Housewives.Sully shows something rarely seen in movies these days, the simple heroism of ordinary people, like the ferry boat crew members who rescue the passengers from the plane.Be sure to stay for the credits, where you will see a reunion of many of the actual passengers and crew from the flight. And as Columbo would say, just one more thing - The last line of the movie is a hoot and got a big laugh! Highly recommended."

The plot is told in a way that I personally enjoyed, I liked seeing the different snippets of time.Though no-one is on the same level as Hanks in this, there are a few other good performers. Aaron Eckhart (Jeff) does well, while there are less important roles for people like Anna Gunn (Elizabeth) and Michael Rapaport (Pete). I have no issues with the casting, that's for sure.It's a crazy true story, mad that it happened way back in 2009 - feels more recent, strangely. I assume it uses the usual creative license that practically every film does, which I'm fine with. It delivers as a quality film, which is all I truly care about."

      "text": "A disappointing but predictably pedestrian telling of the plane that, due to an unforeseen bird strike on the aircraft, went down in New York's Hudson River. This is a big incident being told in a small time frame for the most part. Therefore, once the birds have done there damage and the plane crash lands there is nowhere much else for the film to go. Sure, we have endless 'what if' reconstructions and the inevitable investigation into the cause of the plane's downing, but this is all filler even if the recreations of the crash are well realised. The investigation by officials into Sully's actions are a bit on the ploddy side, only sparking any interest very occasionally. The scenes with Laura Linney are just impossible. The actress plays the part of the rather selfishly concerned wife in a dreary and tiresome manner. Her scenes add nothing to the drama, but add much to the film's descent into the average. Thankfully, the film is mercifully short."

The film stars Tom Hanks, Laura Linney and Aaron Eckhart and was directed by Clint Eastwood who, like rare wine, seems to get better with each passing year. Told via flashbacks and background events, the audience is made an integral part of the fateful events that the passengers on the New York to Charleston flight experienced that cold winter morning as their plane departed from Laguardia Airport and ended up in the icy waters of the Hudson. The film is indeed a testament to the expertise of the pilot whose split second performance is later evaluated and scrutinized by the investigating agencies using the benefit of hindsight with their self-serving 20/20 vision. It\u2019s always impressive to see a film where everyone knows the outcome yet a feeling of tension and anxiety can be so effectively created in spite of that. Kudos to Mr. Eastwood whose directorial skills show themselves in each frame and scene and make this a truly positive movie to see. A Washington Post article jokingly said that one should never travel with Mr. Hanks for as \"Captain Phillips\", the Federal Express employee in \"Cast Away\" and the commander of \"Apollo 13\", his trips almost always seem to encounter problems. That being said, I urge all to travel this time with Mr. Hanks as Captain Sullenberger on his 280 second flight from land to water, It is a quality venture that the movie traveler most certainly will enjoy.  I give the film a 9 for no matter what seat you are in, it will truly be a \"first class\"  experience."

It is named after Captain Sullenberger, or \"Sully\" for short. The movie is based on a book 'Highest Duty' that Sully co-wrote.\r I am a big fan of Clint Eastwood as a director, and my expectations were high, especially considering Tom Hanks starring in this movie, and high ratings from both critics and audience.\r Hanks's performance was as good as I was hoping for. I enjoyed cinematography for the most part, even though sometimes computer-generated graphics were too obvious.\r Directing for me was not very impressive, however. People in some episodes did not look authentic or believable. Additionally, Eastwood over-dramatized National Transportation commission's incident investigation, making them look like bad guys trying find fault in Captain Sully's actions. A quick look at Wikipedia proved that it was not the case. I understand the importance of artistic license, and that the movie is not a documentary, but the event was too recent, and Hollywood should not re-invent history to destroy real peoples' reputation.\r Overall the movie is not bad and is worth watching but it is definitely not one of Eastwood's best."

He would be on every talk show, in every newspaper, on the cover of every magazine, an all around media darling.\r Now 7 and \u00bd years later, director Clint Eastwood has made a movie simply called \u201cSully\u201d, starring America\u2019s nice guy Tom Hanks. Though the crash is the center of the movie the screenwriter, Todd Komamicki, has the movie revolve around Sully, the man before and after the crash, especially when he is being questioned as to whether he could have gotten back to LaGuardia airport, or had made it to Teterboro airport in New Jersey, by the National Transportation Safety Board as if trying to blame Sully for \u2018pilot error\u2019. (The NTSB claims that the movie is inaccurate regarding the hearings.)\r Director Eastwood handles Sully\u2019s nightmares following the landing, his life before and after the near disaster and telephone talks with his wife, Lorrie, who is at home. He shows the media surrounding Sully in New York and Lorrie at home. He and his cinematographer Tom Stern recreate the crash a couple of times and make each time harrowing even though you know the ending. From the moment the birds causing both engines to burn out the 208 seconds that Sully will always been known for will have you tensing up.\r Kudos to Eastwood for keeping the film down to a sharp, fast moving 96 minutes and picking, directing a perfect cast. Tom Hanks delivers an Oscar nominating worthy performance just as Aaron Eckhart, as his co-pilot Jeff Skiles, deserves a best supporting nomination. Laura Linney, who has most of her scenes on the phone, as Lorrie Sully's wife, gives a moving performance while Anna Gunn is a standout on the NSTB.\r For a change Eastwood has the music in the background almost unnoticeable taking nothing away from the movie though the Marriott hotels are sure noticeable in any scenes showing New York!\r \u201cSully\u201d is a good movie, certainly worth seeing not only for the story of Sullenberger but for Hanks best performance in awhile!"

I can't say for one moment that I didn't feel like watching the movie throughout, it kept me immersed (no pun intended)\r However, I have a few complaints.\r(**Slight spoilers ahead**)\rFirstly, I think opportunities for character development were cut or otherwise lost. Sully's experience with the military, his struggles at home and his 'hallucinations' could all have been expanded upon, to give us a greater insight into his character.\rWhile we do sympathize with and root for him, his character is a paddling pool when it should have been an ocean.\rAlso, I think the NTSB is unnecessarily demonized. They are only doing their job, after all, which is to check all angles of the story to properly investigate it.

      "text": "Remember when a plane flew into the Hudson Bay? Remember all 155 passengers on board who miraculously survived the impact? Remember the pilot responsible for making the quick move that prevented this delay from becoming a disaster?\u200bNow, seven and a half years after these events shook the world, the story of Captain Chesley Sullenberger is brought to the screen by director Clint Eastwood and actor Tom Hanks. Based on the autobiography, \u201cHighest Duty,\u201d Sully expresses how the passengers\u2019 fear was vanquished by their pilot\u2019s risky and controversial thinking in a fashion that will inspire dads and business professionals across the nation.It begins with a nightmare by the infamous pilot of his airplane flying uncontrollably into the city, the sounds of the plane booming real enough to rattle you the right way. He wakes up to yet another news report of his catastrophic Flight 1549 landing from January 15, 2009. This reality is simply too overwhelming for him to handle, so much so, that he can\u2019t even go jogging without facing a near-hit by a taxi cab. Neither he nor his family can escape from the reporters, talk shows, and high city court who won\u2019t shut up about the controversy. It\u2019s almost as if 911 is happening all over again, except consequentially by one of America\u2019s own heroes.He explains in flashback precisely why he allowed the landing in spite of claims that the left engine could still have been idling. It all follows a nonlinear storytelling structure similar to what Stanley Kubrick or Quentin Tarantino have popularized. Maybe this flashback structure wasn\u2019t necessary in the telling of the story, or maybe it just wasn\u2019t edited properly. But either way, it got frustratingly confusing as to where or when I was in time, especially when it returns me to a scene that if left off of a half hour earlier.If you were to go ask anyone who was there on that day of the Hudson Bay landing, they would go on to say from backed up evidence that these events are true to what happened; but this retelling doesn\u2019t feel quite true enough. Even right from the release of the first trailer, I knew that Tom Hanks wasn\u2019t going to fit the part, particularly because he does not look the part at all. Basically all the makeup artists do to make him look authentic is spray-paint his hair white and glue a moustache onto his face, which looks completely unconvincing that he is representing the real flight hero. Then if you look everywhere else around him, there is an excessive amount of branding for New York\u2019s culture. The words \u201cNew York\u201d are everywhere within the overused wide-shots of the city, something that not even the fake-looking CGI planes can distract us from.Yet I still wouldn\u2019t say that it makes this a horrible viewing experience. Far from it, in fact. Sully is backed up with plenty of satisfactory performances by the whole cast, particularly Aaron Eckhart (The Dark Knight, Thank You for Smoking), who plays Captain Sullenberger\u2019s first officer and best friend. There\u2019s also Laura Linney (Mystic River, The Truman Show) who plays the captain\u2019s stay-at-home wife. She\u2019s not the most well-developed or memorable of characters, but her love for her husband still comes out satisfactorily well.Yeah, that\u2019s a good word to sum up this movie. It\u2019s satisfactory. It\u2019s certainly better than average, but not the best thing ever like I hoped it would. It\u2019s just plain satisfactory as good, wholesome, inspirational entertainment. It\u2019s not that bad for tributing a man who was so big he had an alcoholic beverage named after him (it\u2019s made with a shot of Grey Goose Vodka and a splash of water, so feel free to make it at home!)It\u2019s also worth noting that the end credits feature some special guest appearances who will make this entire movie truly worth the trip."

This film is more about the investigation into Captain \u201cSully\u201d Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) after he saved 155 people by landing his plane on the river. The structure alternates between his struggles with the sudden attention, the inquiry itself and the fateful flight. The flight is staged several times in a very rational manner, never wildly tense but more procedural (not surprising considering director straightforward Clint Eastwood's style). However, the visual effects are stunningly real. While the behind-the-scenes story is fascinating and Hanks maintains his steely resolve, this is more an examination than an experience.

Hanks is as reliable as always, as is Aaron Eckhart by his side. The story itself also provided some interesting insight  into the event. However, it also ultimately felt a little rushed, straightforward, and a bit too short, running at only a little over an hour and a half. It also felt as though the retelling was a little disjointed and uneven at times, as it jumped back and forth between the landing incident and real time a bit too much and I felt as though a better balance could've been found.

Didn't see any outstanding supporting acting but Hanks alone was enough to portray the story.  I almost rated it a 9 but some of the dialogue in some scenes seemed to staged.  The accomplishment of Capt. Sullenberg was felt throughout the theater and was greeted with applause at the end of the film."

      "text": "Sully was the type of movie where I didn't expect much. The trailer was good but I doubted that they could make a good movie with such a tiny plot. But I was terribly wrong. First off, this film would be nowhere as good as it was if Clint Eastwood didn't direct this film. He directed this film in such passion and profession. The performances in this film were electrifying. Tom Hanks was outstanding and Aaron Eckhart was amazing as well. The flashback element was very well used in this film and the major plane scene was very suspenseful. Sully did feel a bit too long towards the end; but overall, I had a surprisingly fun time watching this film with my family. (83/100)"

It's a well made movie with good performances but there wasn't anything exceptional about it. I feel like it's a cliche at this point to say that Tom Hanks is really good in a movie but that's the case with Sully. He absolutely carries the movie from start to finish in a slightly rushed and an uninspired by the numbers biopic."

I honestly thought Sully would lose his pilot's license at the hearing until they added the 35 second thing and it showed in the simulation going back to LaGuardia would be a bridge crash and going to Tudorborough would put the plane into a tenement. That was slightly fun when the chubbyish bald guy from the NTSB was like\r\"Um.... okay then. Apparently Sully did what he should have.\"\rThat's what I got from the look on his face...."

      "text": "Tom Hanks is pilot whose plane encounters a problem after take-off. Some unnecessary jumping back and forth takes place. Hanks is first treated as a hero and then doubts creep in, though I couldn't doubt Tom Hanks for an instant, which left me asking me no questions as the movie drifted by. Still, it's a reasonable way to let an hour or so drift by."

      "text": "Leaves one wanting to understand how much leeway the movie takes from reality.  Successfully tackles the problem of getting a 96 minute movie out of a 30 second event, clearly not allowing a minute to of respite for a bathroom break. Left with too many questions, however, regarding a rather black and white approach of the FAA vs Sully dispute - with the FAA coming off as highly incompetent. The reality must have been somewhere in the middle, is it so heroic to do what you are trained for, when you see that you have no other options. Movie does a decent job at polarization for the sake of a pretty good movie, but unlikely for reality."

Hank played his role almost without emotion but because of his interpersonal skills (the real Sully) this works out perfectively.  The joy and the expiration of how something like this could take place was truly outstanding."

      "text": "Sully is an incredible and well acted film, a great way to start the OSCAR race of 2016. It is a biographical film that tells the story of Captain Chesley \"Sully\" Sullenberger who manage to deter US Flight 1549 from an impending crash and instead made an emergency landing to the Hudson River. He becomes an overnight hero saving the lives of all 155 passengers and suddenly all eyes are on him. The NTSB and few media outlets don't believe in his decision and a thorough investigation ensues leaving his career on a hanging thread. Sully must prove that his quick move to land on the Hudson was the best choice. Sully is portrayed by Tom Hanks, who is brilliant and every role he plays, he is fully committed. Like last years award winning film, Bridge of Spies, Tom Hanks played a character trying to prove ones worth. In Bridge of Spies, playing James Donovan, he proved that we can't easily judge a person by their nationality and where they came from. In Sully, he prove that humanity is the biggest factor in what makes us human. It is humanity that we can make rational judgement. What makes Hanks performance differ from the two films, is the way he portrays the characters. You believe in the role he plays and that is what makes him an incredible actor. Clint Eastwood did an amazing job directing the film by focusing on the main story and ignored the spectacles, just letting the script come to play."

Years later I saw you try to deliver some packages and get stranded on an island with a cute volleyball, I am so glad you managed to return safely and make a new volleyball friend but it was very dangerous. For your next job you insisted on going onto a train to take little kids to see Santa Claus, which i admire, but the tracks were very slippery so you and the children's safety was very much at risk. Many years went by and I thought you had finally smartened up but then you go on a boat this time and guess what, you go and get yourself kidnapped by Somali pirates. I thought this would have been the final straw for you but this year (only a short time after your Somali incident) i saw a trailer of the news that you flew a plane into the Hudson River to make an emergency landing. I am really worried about you Tom Hanks, please stop taking forms of transportation I dont want to see anymore documentaries about you that make me scared.\r Sincerely,\rA worried citizen"

I won't forget how they grilled him and his copilot during the hearings.  To have endured the criticism and judgment about his ability to fly the plane was a feat in itself!  Good for Sully to have the character and smarts to prove  them wrong.  He was indeed the champ to have braved and navigated that plane on such a bitter cold January day."

      "text": "Sully (2016)\rAn excellent bio-pic of the events of Nov. 14, 2014, \u201cSully\u201d employs the back-story of the hearings by the FAA and the NTSB with both real-life footage and re-enactments of those same events. Director Clint Eastwood weaves an interesting story where one stays focused and involved. Very fine acting by Tom Hanks (Capt. Chesely \u201cSully\u201d Sullenberger), Aaron Eckhart (as first officer Jeff Skiles), Laura Linney (Lorrie Sullenberger, the pilot\u2019s wife) and a good supporting cast helps immensely to make \u201cSully\u201d an engaging 96 minutes.\rOn a brisk Winter\u2019s day of Jan. 15, 2009 at 3:27 PM EST, a US Airways Airbus A320 took off from Newark, NJ headed for Charlotte, NC with 155 souls aboard. The plane had barely lifted off when a flight of Canada geese struck the aircraft and both engines shut down. Unable to return to Newark or land at nearby Teeterborough NJ airport due to low altitude, Capt. Sullenberger made the decision to attempt a water landing in the Hudson River. The rest is history.\rCritically acclaimed and a huge box office success, Sully is rated PG-13 for some gritty language, but is certainly appropriate for the 12 years + crowd. In fact, Eastwood places emphasis on the human spirit and courage portrayed by the crew, passengers and first responders.\rCurrently in theaters, Sully is worth seeking out now or when it is released in DVD, Blue Ray (expected to be in December, 2016) or later on-demand on cable."
