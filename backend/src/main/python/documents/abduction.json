His acting consists of a pout and his angry look and  has not grown beyond his limited acting ability in the Twilight movies. The rest of the cast does a good job of walking through their roles and excepting the paycheck but there is nothing that I would want to see or experience again.Lautner, either better take some acting lessons or give it up now because the body and prissy acting isn't going to get him anywhere."

The main character is the 'guy who knows everything but got his memory erased and is now being chased by some weirdo government officials'. Unfortunately, the film starts out with power and dies out very simply. Don't get me wrong: Taylor Lautner was better in this movie than \"Twilight\" with all that action. However, he's still too young compared to Matt Damon or other action stars. In conclusion, my advice is you to RENT IT. R) 4.6"

      "text": "If Abduction does anything, it makes the viewer laugh multiple times in a 90 minute span. Its like its building to one big punch line with little nuggets of comedy along the way. This would be a good thing if this film was a comedy. John Singleton brings an action film so terrible it crosses into spoof territory with a lead actor (Taylor Lautner) who is thoroughly repulsive (at least acting wise). Singletons desire to make a fast paced action film which calls back to older films just reminds the viewer that the older films were so much better. As his first lead role away from The Twilight Saga, Lautner flops like a fish on dry land. He fails to tell the difference between acting and annunciation. The film suffers from other things but the score pretty much says it all. Its a shambles of a movie which everyone involved should be ashamed of, especially Lautner."

I mean seriously if you do not like Taylor Lautner then dont even go see his movies because you know you are going to hate it. So this is just me spreading the word to not be a bully in other words. Just because he is a celebrety does not mean you can talk crap about them. What the hell is wrong with you? I f you were a celebrety would you like people talking crap about? Think about it that way. He can come on this cite to see how the movie did and get hurt by what people typed in. All I am saying is to be carefull with waht you say. It could affend, hurt, and make people sad including you so just be curtiouse. Now remember that these words are coming from a ten year old but does not mean  that if you are older than me you know it all. I am not saying I know it all because I do not but what I am saying is just to be nice because I have realized that to many people these days are way to mean and have no respect for others. So when you are righting these reveiws do not just think about your self think about others also. Or go to hell because that is no way to be acting. please just be nice. That is all I am asking. Ok.

They like different, not good. This movie is the exact opposite... it's good, not different. There's nothing exceptional about this film. Taylor Lautner's acting range is still very limited so I'm not sure how many more lead roles he'll get in mainstream cinema. He's still young so he could still become an impressive action star because he's got the skill set for it in terms of fighting and athletic ability but if his acting doesn't improve he'll just be another of the bunch. The rest of the cast did a solid job though and the action sequences were done well. Lautner doing his own stunts helped in that area. The story, while not necessarily unique, still developed well. Overall, this was a good but not great movie that was plenty entertaining enough for its genre."

The acting is pretty bad; Taylor Lautner is horrible, but is not just him that is bad, there are some very capable actors here that do not deliver. The fault is not on them entirely because the script is bad as well, there is some atrocious dialogue in this film. The main problem with Abduction though is the plot. There are gaping plot holes in the narrative that just leaves way too much up in the air; by the end of the movie you still won't have any clue who any of the players are, whether they were good/bad, or what their motives were. This makes for a film that has some decent action sequences that entertain, but a story that frankly makes zero logical sense."

Taylor Lautner is impressive with his physical ability and high kicks, but the absolute painstaking part of the \"Abduction\" experience is Lautner's acting...or the lack of ability to do so.  A true alien abduction, complete with probing, would have been less painful.  I see a Razzie in Lautner's future.  I would have to say it is a sure thing.  As for the plot, not really well thought out, but who am I to say...I was too focused on Lautner, wondering if his next line may just be the one he nails."

The presence of Weaver, Isaacs, and Molina affords this film the performance levity that it so desperately requires to be even halfway interesting. However, even those players can't make this better. It's not horrible, but we soon learn that the central topic of this film really doesn't apply at all.....just another \"on the run from the bad guys\" plot with actors that are nice to look at."

Thirdly, in this film, director John Singleton demonstrates extreme technical ineptitude - the framing is clumsy, the editing heavy-handed, the pace and tone of the film inconsistent. I guess the film has one selling point - that at an alarmingly frequent rate, it is unintentionally hilarious. Despite all these basic film errors, the most shocking, most insulting thing about Abduction is the number of exceptionally talented actors (Sigourney Weaver, Alfred Molina and Jason Isaacs) who are willing to sell their souls for a pay cheque."

To be honest, the only thing I've seen him in were the Twilight films and I  hated them! In Abduction, Lautner shows that he's more than just a pretty face. Not only can this kid act, but he's a martial arts expert too! The story is super strong and he is supported by some great veteran character actors, like Sigourney Weaver. The story follows a boy, who while doing a school project, finds a picture of himself on a missing person website. It leads him into an unbelievable story, full of twists and turns. It's unbelievable, yes...but still good! It's an action film, with a very solid background story and some fairly big names. Don't let the big name Teen Idol starring in it, keep you away.

The script was very well put together. The words flowed together and made the whole movie seem real. The script showed the hurt and distrust that Nathan had for everyone around him. For example, \u201cTrust needs to be earned\u201d was said throughout the entire movie. The script also helps the plot out by showing the intensity of the movie. You weren't really sure what was going to happen next, which was the main point of the movie I believe. For example, when Nathan finds out that the \u201cparents\u201d he had been living with his whole life turn out to not be his actual parents he has to find out how to deal with this. He also sets out on a mission to find out who his real parents which involved a lot of distrust of people, fighting and confusion.The acting was very well put together. The way Nathan showed his emotions helped me to respond to the movie emotionally in a way of understanding what it\u2019s like to not know who to trust and the hurt of not knowing the truth. Also, the smaller parts of the movie helped play out the movie. For example, Nathan\u2019s friend who helped him get the tickets to the baseball game and gave him everything else he needed was a huge part of the movie. Lastly, the direction of the film showed throughout the movie. Everything in the movie worked well together and it didn't look to me like anything was controlled or faked. I do believe that the film succeeded it\u2019s original purpose, to be suspenseful and keep the audience on their toes."
