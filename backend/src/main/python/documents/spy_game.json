Redford's performance was outstanding. Redford showed that how strong the nerves can be of a person who is in espionage. Awesome realistic performance from Redford and Pitt supported him well."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Excellent taut thriller with new-millennium A-list star Brad Pitt teaming with 70's A-lister Robert Redford (smartly casted in a 'Buddy picture' after Pitt took direction from Redford in his memorable yet under-appreciated \"A River Runs Through it\" from 1994) in an entertaining spy film directed by action-obsessed Tony Scott which will have you at times on the edge of your seat. Scott rewards his action hungry audience in calculated doses as the picture is laced with lots of intrigue, and second guessing including a clever use of flashback sequences for additional suspense to this international thriller. Catherine McCormack is appealing as the love interest for Pitt's character which goes beyond obligatory since the joining of the two conflicts with his mentor's guidelines for espionage survival. The chemistry of all the players along with Scott's exciting action input make this an above average Pitt/Redford 'Buddy flick'."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Wahoo score! I liked this movie a lot even though not perfect. The flashback to Nam scenes were a little hard to believe even with the attempt to make RR look somewhat younger. Some dialogue was poor.. \" Why do you think they keep dumping him\" Great story idea though and loved the cat and mouse. RR is back in this one with a role i really liked and Brad P did a nice job. Duncan was cast well as well as the director of CIA. One weak link was the opponent to RR from CIA.. can't remember his name now lol."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Although far from Tony Scott's best work, Spy Game makes for an entertaining movie. It gets too convoluted at times and also stretches it's timeline a bit too thin for any sustained emotional impact. On the plus side, seeing Robert Redford slinking his way around the CIA HQ, covertly giving his superiors the finger is a very amusing prospect indeed. Fun but inessential viewing."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Apr\u00c3\u00a8s l'excellent et palpitant Ennemi d'Etat, Tony Scott nous d\u00c3\u00a9voile une autre facette du monde de l'espionnage avec Spy Game. Utilisant sa mise en sc\u00c3\u00a8ne habituel qui se rapproche d'un clip (qui est le point faible du film), le fr\u00c3\u00a8re de Ridley nous livre, certes un film conventionnel, mais qui poss\u00c3\u00a8de tout ce qui faut pour \u00c3\u00aatre un tr\u00c3\u00a8s bon divertissement de suspense et d'espionnage, muscl\u00c3\u00a9 et intelligent, desservi par une brochette d'acteur de qualit\u00c3\u00a9.

Robert Redford is very good, Brad Pitt is solid, and the plot is interesting, but beyond that, things struggle. First off, the plot is a little overcomplicated. There is so much going on that it can be hard to follow, even if you are paying attention. In addition to being overly complicated, the plot is 100% implausible. Some elements likely ring true, but the way things turn out and the events leading to the ending are completely implausible and simply not believeable. Speaking of the plot, it is entirely formulaic. I usually do not mind formulaic films, but this one is obnoxiously so. At times, it works and at others, it simply becomes too predictable. In terms of the direction, I am not a huge fan of Tony Scott. His storytelling here is sketchy and then other elements of this one are simply not for me. As with many of his films, he is simply too formulaic of a director and does nothing extraordinarily well. The editing is also bad, which is almost a guarantee in a Tony Scott film. In one scene in particular, it just kept cutting from a two-shot to close ups obnoxiously and without need, which was very distracting. Bad editing is usually when it is distracting and in many scenes here, it is distracting. Ultimately, however, Spy Game is in fact entertaining and fun to follow. Thanks to great performances and a satisfying ending and premise, this one is just mediocre, rather than a complete and utter disaster."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I think this film is one of the best films to come out of the USA. It is clever, has a very solid script, very few monologue cliches, very well acted, perfect settings, good cinematography and combines both the darker and lighter side of humanity in a way that most other films just fail at. Have watched 4 times, I will watch it again in a few years I would think."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "The main problem with Spy Game is that the conclusion is about as implausible as the premise for Blade Runner, which is a little ironic since the directors of the two aforementioned films are, respectively, brothers Tony Scott and Ridley Scott.What's wrong with how Spy Game ends?  Well, rather than engage in spoilers let's just say the film's conclusion would likely set off World War III, or something close to it, and most of the senior administrators of CIA would find themselves out of a job, and our protagonist, ably played by Robert Redford, would almost certainly find himself in prison for life and never mind how many skeletons he could produce out of deep dark closets.Another problem with Spy Game is that it suffers from the same syndrome afflicting so many spy flicks:  there are no good guys, except maybe our protagonist.  The Russians are bad, the Chinese are bad, and the Americans are all bad and backstabbing everybody in their own agency, most especially our protagonist.  And the problem of course is that nobody's going to risk their life for an agency run by backstabbing SOBs who are just waiting for any excuse to rub out anyone who knows enough to defeat their schemes and reveal them as evil.Spy Games isn't a bad film, but it's severely limited by its ending."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "As an espionage thriller, the plot works in a different way than the one already known; the lack of the typical action sequences is well compensated even if it is not one of the best in the genre. What is certain is that it is not boring."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This underrated spy thriller by Tony Scott (Top Gun, Man on Fire) follows retiring CIA agent Nathan Muir (Robert Redford) as he recalls his training of Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt) while working against agency politics to release him from his Chinese captors. Not high on action but never lacking in tension thanks to Scott\u2019s ever-tight direction. This is a movie about mind-games and sharp dialogue with both Redford and Pitt delivering knockout performances. Worth checking out if you are a fan of more realistic spy movies that dwell on the moral ambiguities involved with espionage."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "A Bit Louder Than Anticipated.Spy GameScott's game among spies is more thrilling as a desk job than it is on field. Split into two bits, the Redford part undeniably steals the show with a large margin, whilst Pitt's sequences, no matter how hungry for blazing guns or breathtaking chase sequences or big explosions, feels like empty punches. The dull execution is to be blamed along with a cheesy script that has managed to snatch in every good trick from such genre films; and it is people-pleasing, but there is not an inch of art in this commercial cinema. With cheap camera work that notions its existence of a B grade quality with A grade cast, that are totally misused.Aforementioned, the ticking clock behind Redford and his tactics that never fails to surprise us along with his every posture on the narration, the writers have chiseled him in every step to be an impenetrable stature that is both easily absorbing and lethal, he lives up to his game. The performance of Redford is quite convincing, if not anything extraordinary, his body language and eye does up the ante along with his sarcastic arguments that has a way out of every door. Pitt, on the other hand, has all the physical work to do, in fact, he never shines on screen on his own merit, not only on performance but in character as well.He barely supports Redford, he is often manipulated, he is a hot head with no character development that comes off as a pawn staged to ooze sexiness on screen; even though Redford overcomes that limitation, a Porsche does boost him though. Spy Game has petty rules that is equally entertaining as it is incongruent, even its last aspect of getting two stars on screen with an incredible chemistry fails poorly; the sunglasses won't be enough."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "On his retirement day, Nathan Muir, a veteran CIA agent, must respond to an informal inquiry about his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Tom Bishop, who was captured on a mission on China. For the US, which is in the throes of delicate trade negotiations with that country, the situation could not have been more inconvenient. Abandoned by the agency because of political concerns, its Muir's job to try to help his colleague.This movie is not excellent but it was within what I expected. The pace is good, there is a good tension and a very nice suspense throughout the movie. There are also some action scenes, punctually. Nevertheless, the story told has flaws and problems with logic, which become increasingly evident as the film moves to its conclusion. The ending is truly unlikely.Robert Redford is the actor who best disentangled himself in this movie. He is a veteran and the character is tailored for him. Without ever losing his pose and composure, he has a very good collaboration with Brad Pitt. The dialogues are good and work well, especially between the two actors. What didn't go well was the movie's romantic subplot, which is bad considering the relevance that will be given to it. Simply, that part of the story was never credible.Good photography, good sets and costumes, a discreet soundtrack, good sound and visual effects, some good special effects, used with moderation. It's not the movie we're going to see because of its technicalities, despite meeting Hollywood's standards. Its a movie that is worth it for the interesting story it brings us and for the good work of the two main actors, very particularly Redford. But in fact there are better movies out there, and these will probably prove quite forgettable over time."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Clever story, great writing and simply brilliant performance from the two main actors.
