A fitting final tribute to the franchise. Ignore the politically correct snowflake movie press. This is what an action film should be, and it\u2019s action the whole way through, albeit very violent, so not one for the kids. One of my favourite films from 2019. I saw it in the big screen, just enjoyed it again on TV download."

Despu\u00e9s de Rambo 3 y Rambo 2008 no me esperaba que la saga mejorara tanto, incluso torn\u00e1ndose entre mis favoritas de la saga y del genero! Si bien en cierta medida se siente distinta a las anteriores, al no centrarse tanto en la guerra y mas que nada en cuestiones familiares, al final la pel\u00edcula resulta agarrar muchas cosas de la primera pel\u00edcula, cosa que me encanto. Tiene una historia emotiva, y al final la acci\u00f3n deja un buen sabor de boca, teniendo una de las escenas mas intensas de toda la saga. Y si bien en algunas partes es medio exagerado, no llega al nivel de irrealismo y de malos efectos especiales de Rambo 2008.Aunque nunca se sabe como es que los mexicanos encuentran a Rambo (a lo mejor el les dejo una direcci\u00f3n en la foto), y la historia en si tampoco es tan original. Sin embargo, agarra las mejores cosas de la saga y del genero para hacer algo muy disfrutable. No considero que sea la mejor de la saga; la primera tiene personajes tan memorables y una historia muy buena, pero no tiene nada que envidiarle. Totalmente recomendada."

While it's not \"Rambo\" in the sense of a guy running through a jungle with a gun or whatever, it's a solid movie that kept me entertained from beginning to end and it's easily Sly's best film out of his most recent ones. It also has a message to the movie that a lot of people don't seem to like but is completely acceptable. Solid watch."

The main issue is THERES NO STORY or if there was it could have been done alot better. It's still worth a watch if you're a fan of the series and action movies"

It really takes a while to get going but ends with a bang just like the last Rambo movie. I was not disappointed, maybe it could have been better, but it's Rambo and you know what to expect overall. Script could have been a bit tighter overall and it's really slow for nearly the entire first half of the movie. Worth a view for sure."

      "text": "Um filme sem alma, sem inspira\u00e7\u00e3o. O primeiro arco do filme foca muito no desenvolvimento do Rambo como um personagem humano, com medos, traumas e arrependimentos. O problema \u00e9 que isso entra em contradi\u00e7\u00e3o visto que a \"narrativa\" \u00e9 abandonada rapidamente, e o pouco tempo de constru\u00e7\u00e3o de personagem \u00e9 feita de forma superficial. O problema disso \u00e9 que todo o nosso sentimento pelo personagem se torna inexistente. Voc\u00ea n\u00e3o liga se ele morre ou vive. O mesmo vale para a adolescente, que n\u00e3o condiz com a personalidade de uma, e os vil\u00f5es super caricatos. Inclusive, o plot que se torna o motivo pelo qual ele quer matar os caras \u00e9 super previs\u00edvel.O segundo ponto s\u00e3o as cenas de a\u00e7\u00e3o. Eu n\u00e3o assisti aos filmes antecessores, mas acredito que esse tema stealth seja uma caracter\u00edstica do personagem, mas isso n\u00e3o \u00e9 uma desculpa para cenas t\u00e3o mortas cinematograficamente. Como eu disse a principio: voc\u00ea n\u00e3o liga pra quem vive ou morre. Toda afli\u00e7\u00e3o que poderia ser alcan\u00e7ada foi extremamente desperdi\u00e7ada. Sem contar que esse modelo de combate poderia ser mais explorado aqui, saindo do mais do mesmo pra uma nova forma de mostrar o que est\u00e1 acontecendo."

The film is littered with ultra-violent set pieces and manages to keep a brisk pace while the carnage spews on-screen. The story is half-baked and the script leaves much to be desired, but that's exactly why this series is not for everyone to enjoy. But for the sickos (like me), this one is a bloody and brutally fun ride from start to finish."
