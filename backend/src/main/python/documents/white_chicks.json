Maybe the people who made this movie should re-watch it and tell themselves what a complete waste of time and money it was. Also, some people should seriously reconsider their views after watching this movie."

I heard no derogatory words against white people such as 'cracker' or 'honky'. If anything I heard the word **** or 'Blacky Chan' a lot. It's a black comedy so it's not suitable for every audience, not trying to be racist, but Black comedies have that 'racist'( As the Idiots reviewing this 0) joke. They make fun of all cultures. I haven't heard a single person I have met who doesn't like White Chicks, its a favorite.It is isn't supposed to be racist, but even then the whole plot is more of an action film.The people reviewed this an gave a negative answer are obviously some old idiots who cannot tell the difference between the joke and an insult. The best way to like this film do not take it seriously! Common sense can prevail."

Just because a film may take a while to film, and with painstaking effort, does not mean we should take pity on the production team - a film I adore which was used without computers and technology but what was certainly better and certainly a hit with the critics, Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Now, White Chicks itself might be a pathetic product of a lazy day out with the Wayans brothers, so I really don't care whether they were lazing on their ass when they filmed this, or just worked hard to make people assume they were doing something.I wasn't sure where this was going at the start - the plot didn't seem to make any sense. I was then revealed what was actually going on - with severe disappointment. I'm sure many films out there have used this ongoing theme of men dressing up as women - with actual style following a decent plot. This is just cheap, lazy entertainment following two black guys dressed up as white women making disgusting, immature jokes looking nothing like what they're supposed to be - of what I heard, I never got the chance to find out after I switched the TV off after barely even halfway through. But even that was too much - even if you begin to watch this, it would put you off big time."

We can't avoid them, because when we look for a particular type of film for the occasion, they will pop-up and that is how I watched this now. I know it is a silly comedy, because in a real world this thing never happen. So knowing this is only for cinema, I prepared to enjoy whatever it offers. But I must say, even though my rating is not big, I kind of enjoyed it.\r Nobody watches this without knowing its synopsis. So you will already know the fifty per cent of the story when you do. The rest is how it is developed; including how good the jokes are that comes with our watch. So much clich\u00e9, but entertaining with some good scenes and lines. The actors were excellent. The make-ups were not flawless, but worked okay, especially for a comedy. Because if there is an error, it will going to appeals from the comedic side.\r So the overall film was better than what I presumed all these years. Glad I saw it, it's nothing like those silly comedies I've seen. I've seen many imposter themes, but this is refreshing. All the above, this is a one off film, that's the best thing about it. You know, sequels are what degrades the original film in most of the scenarios. Thanks for that, there's no follow-up for this with a B movie cast and crew. This is a very much watchable film, not comedy riot, but fairly does its job.\r 6/10"

O filme \u00e9 claramente politicamente incorreto e faz piada com tudo. O proposito do mesmo \u00e9 apelar a pieguice, e \u00e9 t\u00e3o ruim que na maioria das vezes tu se pega dando risada em situa\u00e7\u00f5es completamente idiotas e exageradas. Os irm\u00e3os Wayans s\u00e3o carism\u00e1ticos, e a v\u00ea-los agindo como negros num corpo de patricinhas \u00e9 no minimo desconcertante de c\u00f4mico. O elenco como um todo \u00e9 bem escalado, mas a maior acertada aqui foi o Terry Crews AKA julius. O carisma dele \u00e9 incompar\u00e1vel, e mesmo o personagem dele sendo muito  idiota, conseguimos gostar del gra\u00e7as ao ator.A trilha sonora do filme \u00e9 muito boa, e \u00e9 muito interessante ver que o diretor brinca com algumas situa\u00e7\u00f5es, onde claramente haveria uma mensagem a ser passada - mas n\u00e3o, era s\u00f3 uma situa\u00e7\u00e3o comum mesmo. Eu diria que a maioria das piadas s\u00e3o terr\u00edveis, mas tudo se torna engra\u00e7ado com um amigo(a) ao seu lado para rir contigo. As vezes acho que os cr\u00edticos levam comedias pestelonas a serio demais, ou no minimo v\u00e3o assistir com o pensamento errado. As branquelas \u00e9 fenomenal no seu proposito e deve ser lembrado!"
