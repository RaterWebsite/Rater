As in most movies of the genre, especially from Hollywood, you can\rpretty much expect the outcome to be no big surprise. The good guys win; if you dismiss\revery movie for that reason, you will be dismissing most movies from Hollywood. In Man\rOn The Ledge, it's the ride from the beginning to the end you should find interesting.\rAnyone who feels queasy looking down from high places will find this movie exciting; if you\rsuffer from vertigo, be prepared to be catching your breath in a few scenes. I liked the idea\rof this movie's plot, the lead character Nick Cassidy, an escaped convict, is committing a\rdaring heist to prove he was not guilty of that very crime a few years before. Cassidy is\rproviding a diversion so his team can execute the heist, and a solid diversion it is.\rThough there aren't big names in the flick, there are experienced actors who deliver performances like the professionals they are. Ed Harris and\rTitus Welliver are such experienced actors whose characters are familiar to us. They have played these roles countless times before; they play\rtheir bad guy roles just the way we expect them to in this movie. Edward Burns is also playing a relatively familiar good guy role. Sam\rWorthington, who plays lead Nick Cassidy delivers a solid performance as does Jamie Bell in his role as Nick's brother. Genesis Rodriguez is in\rfine form, one you'll not tire of seeing, really. The movie has all the key elements a good heist should have; suspense, twists and turns, all are\rpresent. If the last couple of movies you watched recently were dramas, Man On The Ledge will be a nice change of pace, so I recommend it on\rthat basis. I quite enjoyed it."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Five! Well, since the five early minutes, thiz movie has already set up the sharp action pace. It does not waste your time any longer. It takes you directly to the center of the story. How a desperate man steps out on a ledge of Manhattan Hotel to commit suicide. Why, what and who are told by flashback storytelling. Four! There are four key characters. First, Sam Worthington is the man on a ledge himself. Yes, we still hear his Australian accent, but it does not matter. He delivers a good and believable presence. We have been sweating along every time he moves around on the thin edge of the building. Elizabeth Banks is the police negotiator who interferes in thiz circumstance. Jamie TINTIN Bell is the brother who conducts a heist on next building, with his girlfriend Angie (Genesis Rodriguez). And Ed Harris is a powerful multi-billionaire who has a covert secret purpose. It reminds me of those simple movies that keep you entertain until the last minute, e.g. PHONE BOOTH (2002), CELLULAR (2004), RED EYE (2005), you named it! I always love thiz kind of movie. Three! Yeah, there are three possibilities to end thiz situation. One, finally he does not jump and the end. Two, he jump and the end, or there will be unthinkable surprise for the ending, one way or another. And yes, you know in your heart it wont end so easily, there are lots of twists and turns waiting for you. You bet! The mystery will keep you guessing until the end. The movie is presented by first-time Director Asger Leth. Two! There are two reasons to watch thiz movie. First is Sam Worthington. Two years ago, I told everyone that someday thiz man will be a great iconic Star. And hey look now. It is the future! He sells the movie only by his name! People will easily cherish him, Woo hoo, the man from AVATAR (2009). The second, if you have watched the trailer, I am sure it would tickle your curiosity about what will happen next. One! Jump! Jump to thiz movie immediately, thiz one is the movie that you want to see.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "As usual, the idiots known as \"movie critics\" missed completely.

Great directing and strong performances all round  I especially liked the behind the scenes elements on the dvd  definitely adds to the sense of realism and attention to detail.

I literally sat on the edge of my seat for most the movie. The action sequences were well shot, and, for a modern thriller, the plot is pretty logical. I don't see the plot holes the critics were talking about. Anyone who didn't enjoy this has something up their a**. Hating on movies for no reason. Overall, this movie was very entertaining, and I find it very hard to believe that it didn't receive a higher user score. I mean, critics are a bunch of gay-lords so I may understand that the lack of gay characters, and the abundance of hot women (Elizabeth Banks, and Genesis Rodriguez anyone?) may have put them off... Also, there is no vague pseudo-art for them to praise here, just an adrenaline rush from beginning to end. Also, I have to respond to some of the sad reviews in here:\rsmoman03 and scrieciu: Fair reviewing means disregarding any preconceived-notions and expectations you may have had about the movie or whatever you are reviewing. gunnyart: please point out the holes in the plot, my IQ is 160 and I have gotten an A in my directing class at UCI and I didn't see any such holes that can't be logically explained, being a smart-ass is so popular these days...\rracketracer: If you admit it is a decent movie why did you give it a 4?? Which makes me wonder about the average brain power of user-reviewers...\rtimbosabo: You managed to nap through the movie, but still pay attention to kyra sedgwicks wardrobe?? Says something about you in my opinion.\rFlorencewong: I don't know you but, just by reading the first sentence of your review, I find you irritating.\rHelenK: I know you are not married yet because you sound unattractive, otherwise, why would you dislike a decent marriage proposal scene (not the best, but decent)... Cringing? If this movie made you cringe I wonder how other things make you feel...\rsnazzyjuice: Cliche? nothing about the story is cliche.

From the start until the end Man on a Ledge does something to keep your eyes glued to the screen. Plenty of action and its a very smart film."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "I was actually surprised by this movie. When i first heard about a movie called \"Man on a ledge\" i was like, wow really? how did they possibly come up with that name? I thought it would be really dumb, but I work at my local movie theater and the majority of the people who saw this movie said it was pretty good. So i became intrigued. I finally decided to just go see it. Going into it with low expectations I was a bit surprised. It was good, but obviously not Oscar material or anywheres near that. With a pretty solid cast all around, including Sam Worthington (Avatar, Terminator Salvation) Anthony Mackie (The Adjustment Bereau, The Hurt Locker) Ed Harris (Alot of movies) and Kyra Sedgwick (The Closer). The cast made the movie look better than it actually was. Although Sam Worthington seems as though he just does any movie he can, hes still a pretty good actor, at least in the 2 movies i listed. The plot obviously is all around weak and very predictable. Everybody with a brain knows what is going to happen in the end. They were some very unrealistic factors in this film such as Sam Worthingtons character making a 25 story leap of faith jump, and just so happens to hit this 15 foot wide cushion thing right in the center, no whiplash or anything, he hops right back up and chases after Ed Harris. I mean, we don't always go to the movies expecting 100% realism, but come on, thats just a bit ridiculous. So overall, I enjoyed myself during this movie, but only because I went in with low expectations. There are very many holes in this movie that just can't be filled, even with a solid cast. If you go in expecting a perfect film you will be very disappointed, so i suggest you go into the theater open minded and you will be entertained. This movie gets an ok from me. 4.5/10"}, {"rating": "4", "text": "It's a good heist/thriller with Sam Worthington leading the way up until the last fourth of the movie where things start to spiral out of sensibility and control. I truly left the theater thinking that the director should probably work on his finishing touches to an otherwise excitement filled movie.

I find '' Man on a Ledge '' weird, because it seems like two different movies in one plot. It's like if the director took two movies, and put them together. The first half was a little slow, yet intriguing. The second half was more of an action pack. So '' Man on a Ledge '' is a normal, forgettable movie.

Unfortunately, this film couldn't have been more ridiculous. Action movies are by nature unrealistic, but most of the time, at least some of the story is believable and makes sense. Man On A Ledge is a film that is all over the place, filled with scenes of unbelievable stupidity. The combination of corruption, theft, ridiculous moves, and lines that sound like their out of a comic book make this movie close to unwatchable. The man on the ledge has an agenda and asks for a beautiful negotiator to talk him down. Even she can see that he's stalling for time, but to what end? It leads to a totally unbelievable story with a horrible ending. I watched this film because I thought it would be different and I love both Elizabeth Banks and Jamie Bell.

To be fair, some reviews of it were much harsher than it deserves, but it is a movie that doesn't deserve to be watched.

Sam Worthington can't be blamed for how bad the movie is, but he does not do much to salvage it. His back story? Same story as the one in Terminator: Salvation.

I promise you, it is not worth it."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "An infuriatingly unoriginal and bland caper film where we have seen every single plot twist before and in better movies where character pathos mattered just enough to keep us invested emotionally. About five minutes in is how long my attention was kept. The majority of the plot is milked so thin that, I bet if all ideas had been thrown on the table and executed fast enough to keep us on our toes, the movie would only have been about 40 minutes long. It's like drinking a soda that is heavily watered down - it tastes mild, with only a few traces of the original drink caught on the taste buds. There is a lot of acting talent wasted here too. Sam Worthington, Ed Harris, Elizabeth Banks, Jamie Bell, and Kyra Sedgwick are all unable to save the movie from sub-mediocrity.

Watchable."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "It's apparent not too long into 'Man on a Ledge' that the premise of it is more than it seems, as Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington) takes to a ledge on one of the highest floors of a New York hotel, but it's immediately clear  that he doesn't have much intention of jumping, that a sleight of hand is in place. Without giving too much away, it's pretty clear that Nick Cassidy isn't up there for the view, or to leap off to his death, but what follows is aiming too much above its weight to the exhausting point of this steak being overdone.  We are lead down a path of conspiracies and ulterior motives, this is when it's easy to realise that the movie acts a lot more seriously than it should, a preposterous twinning of two stories leaves the film fun and cheerful, but not as dramatic as it is trying to be.  What irritates me is the fact that we start off with Nick climbing to the ledge, where we then see a month before where he is in prison, what could have been set up here is a simple dramatic piece of a man seeing error in his decisions, but instead a thriller with many shady characters and money falling from the sky to create diversions, this turns into a heist, to mask a thievery that didn't, emm, actually happen. Elizabeth Banks plays the negotiator who attempts to talk Nick down, she has her own regretful past as she sees that Nick isn't who he says he is. As a thriller, this certainly isn't a a dull affair, with plenty of pulsating action and several twists and turns throughout, but it's also entirely ridiculous and over the top, trading what was a good thing. The lead characters each bring something to the table, but in the grand scheme of things, they get lost in all the flashy ideas that we are given and they must settle for playing second fiddle to an over-arching story. Worthington plays a calm and collective individual on the ledge, but he is much more interesting on the ground when we learn about his past, but the chemistry between himself and Banks feel real and worthwhile. Supporting cast members Anthony Mackie and Titus Welliver deliver solid albeit limited performances, they have significant roles yet small appearances throughout the film. This sums up just how big and serious the film attempts to be, but everything is too co-ordinated to the point where the heroes never seen to be in danger, it's a fun thrill, but one which is playful and entertaining, not one which is too convincing in its execution."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Going into \u00e2"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Good film  Ending was a little too happy to be true and overall some plot parts where basic and unrealistic.

We see things from the point of view of the jumper (Nick Cassidy), the police psychologist (who is rather down on her luck after a failed attempt to stop another jumper elsewhere, which the media reported heavily) and other police officers involved, plus there's the diamond heist, unbeknownst to those observing Nick on the, you guessed it, ledge. I didn't feel it was made clear why Nick was involved with the diamond heist (or maybe I hadn't paid close enough attention to the dialogue?), at least certainly not at first and I thought it was interesting to have a glimpse at the psychologists history or character but we don't really learn a great deal about her overall, which is a shame.The pace of the movie varies, in that its perhaps a little slow to start with and there are some scenes of Nick and the psychologist that are maybe a bit long winded and don't really lead to us learning a great deal, they could perhaps be cut down a little bit but there's certainly a feeling of suspense present in general. I think its that inquisitiveness, wanting to find out more about the background and history of the characters, that kept my interest and I felt that the sense of suspense certainly heightened in the second half of the movie, as the police start to realise who their dealing with and things take an unexpected turn, with one or two plot twists present, which I certainly won't go in to, to prevent unnecessary spoilers.I found it interesting to see how the police franticly scrabbled to put the pieces of the metaphorical puzzle together, to try to figure out what Nick was playing at, what he had been working on and planned, while he stayed quite level headed and uncooperative. It was perfectly watchable and I suppose its interesting how it highlighted the aspect of it being a live news item being reported on TV, showing crowds down on the street level watching and even shouting out encouraging him to jump, which is a bit disturbing, although if they all knew by then that he had criminal links then perhaps that may have something to do with it. I think the downside to this movie, as far as the plot is concerned, is the fact that it centres around someone with a criminal past and you (or I, certainly) couldn't help but wonder, in a sense, why we should be too concerned over such a persons fate. Of course, we realise there are multiple plotlines underway by the time the pace heats up and that adds suspense and intrigue but still, some of the characters are less than endearing (including another bad guy, not Nick), even the psychologist seems a bit almost selfish in a way, although I did root for her to prove her critics wrong and get a good outcome to this particular 'jumper'. I kept feeling throughout that I didn't have the full picture of (the full reasons behind) what exactly was going on, or maybe moreso precisely why but then without the curiosity to find out more then I suppose the movie would have no real appeal and the suspense would be shot.There is certainly a plot twist or two present - the ending I felt was really quite corny/cheesy and I didn't feel was especially believable but one or two others I didn't mind so much. I suppose you could argue it isn't the sort of movie you watch and expect to be entirely believeable - I think this was made to be a suspenseful thriller and its certainly does pretty well to entertain the audience for the running time of approximately an hour and forty minutes, so I suppose from that side of things its decent enough.To summarise, I do feel the plot is a bit confused but its still quite suspenseful and intriguing and is an easy enough watch. I feel this has good potential but maybe isn't quite as good as it could have been, in terms of delving even further into different characters backgrounds and providing more answers to the different questions that arise. This is certainly quite a 'Hollywood' type movie I feel but thats not necessarily a bad thing, its pretty good but not really especially great."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Horrible Script with some good action-  no empathy possible and without any suspension"}], "recommendations": ["the_loft", "a_perfect_getaway", "now_you_see_me", "the_next_three_days", "the_call", "contraband", "the_november_man", "seeking_justice", "the_accountant", "honest_thief", "next", "the_commuter", "gone_girl", "awake", "lucky_number_slevin", "a_walk_among_the_tombstones", "hancock", "wild_card", "the_little_things", "vantage_point", "limitless", "rocknrolla", "the_number_23", "i_see_you", "marauders"]}
