      "text": "A disappointment. Sure, we know how it all turns out, but plenty of other dramatic films have managed to present true stories in a compelling way. Presenting Irving as a buffoon robs the film of its central conflict. And Weisz plays an overwrought role from the start, badly diluting the emotional impact of the defense team's visit to Auschwitz. Really, the lawyers' constant turmoil is distracting. So much effort is expended to create conflict that we are left to wonder how these people ever manage to make it to court on time."

      "text": "Rachel Weisz plays a Holocaust scholar who's sued in British court by a prominent denier (Timothy Spall). While there is a somber, moving visit to Auchwitz, most of the narrative revolves around the legal wrangling. Although it's attempted, the film doesn't succeed in the emotional connection that would have created a powerful experience. Instead, we watch relatively dry legal proceedings (it is England, after all). David Hare's screenplay manages to effectively hit the case's salient points and Weisz's performance is solid, but this is probably the most detached treatment of the Holocaust ever put on film."

      "text": "\u201cDenial\u201d is the true story of an American Holocaust scholar, Deborah E. Lipstadt, who was sued for libel by a Holocust denier as recounted in her book entitled \u201cTrial: My Day in Court with a Holocaust Denier\u201d. The screenplay for the film was written by David Hare based on Ms. Lipstadt\u2019s book. Mick Jackson directed the film which stars Rachel Weisz, Tom Wilkinson and Timothy Spatt. This is basically a courtroom drama played out in the London courts and gives the audience a clear understanding of the fundamentals of the British legal system and the roles the solicitor and barrister play. Yet this is not just another Holocaust story but a rather sensitive and personal insight into those who teach about this unfortunate event in world history as well as those who lived to tell about it. Ms. Weisz\u2019 performance is extraordinary and she communicates her dedication to the role certainly in some part because of her own personal background and experience. As a lawyer I can recite a number of improbabilities and inaccuracies that take place in the courtroom scenes but one must remember that the screenplay is based on the perceptions of Ms. Lipstadt and I believe that, had there been more input from a barrister or solicitor in the making of the film, the noted inaccuracies would not have appeared. That being said, and seeing the film as a layman seeking a good entertainment experience, this film adequately attains that goal. Accordingly, I give the film an 8 with much of the credit going to Ms. Weisz who is largely responsible for its positive rating,."

      "text": "A film told impassionately and emotionally, Denial from director Mick Jackson is an important film exposing \"historian\" David Irving for the liar, anti-semite, xenophobe, and sexist, that he truly is and expresses in his writing. Though the ending may be obvious, the final verdict of the film is not without tension and power, as the film still manages to create the proper impact of the moment. Yet, Denial is held back from being better for being very much typical in regards to both Holocaust and courtroom films. Operating within the confines of its true story, Denial is relegated to filling in the gaps between its courtroom scenes with prototypical courtroom drama interactions, as well as classic moments from better Holocaust movies. My tears and emotion over the Holocaust were present for sure, but the film never really built on anything that past films have not already dissected.\r Yet, in spite of its typical nature, Denial still feels powerful. A court case about proving the Holocaust and honoring the deceased and the survivors, it is a film with inherent emotional prowess. Mick Jackson brings this element to life in the film and really showcases just how impactful this case is, regardless of which way the verdict goes. Should the judge rule in favor of Irving (Timothy Spall) or in favor of Deborah Lipstadt (Rachel Weisz), the ramifications of the case will be far reaching and could, honestly, change the past. It is through the importance and significance that the film finds its success. Riding on its impassioned telling of the story, Denial rises above its cliches and becomes a thoroughly riveting and moving experience.\r This element is most certainly bolstered by the acting. Rachel Weisz is limited in her lead role, yet still brings the good with an emotional performance. Her overt passion shines through and ignites the same passion within the viewer. Her lawyer, Richard Rampton (Tom Wilkinson), has the same passion, yet far more subtle. It is only later in the film that we realize how deeply this case has impacted him to a similar degree as Lipstadt. Wilkinson does a brilliant job bringing this element to life with a typically great performance. As Irving, Timothy Spall is tremendous. He brings Irving and everything about him to the viewer with the end result that you despise him. Spall, though in a vile role, is brilliant. From his non-verbals to the nonchalant delivery of incendiary commentary.\r While its cliches stand as its biggest faults, Denial also does feature a decent amount of filler at times, as well as oddly chosen courtroom scenes. Though powerful, there is very little actual proving of the Holocaust and far name calling of Irving. He may be wrong, but it takes a few court scenes for the film to actually showcase his falsehoods. That said, the courtroom scenes are still powerful, but a little left of center initially before focusing in on the important moments.\r Overall, Denial is passionate and filled with rage towards deniers. It is this powerful approach that elevates it above its cliches and filler to deliver a solid and thoroughly entertaining, yet poignant film with absolutely stellar performances."

      "text": "A capably made, well-acted fact-based courtroom drama that appears to get things down by the book but that also leaves viewers surprisingly emotionally unengaged, a somewhat perplexing outcome given the highly charged nature of the subject matter. Even though the courtroom debate at the heart of this story is more about forensics than emotions, that theme pervades the film so much that the picture feels more clinical than involving. Enjoy the performances (especially Timothy Spall and Tom Wilkinson), and be awed by the moving visit to Auschwitz (one of the few emotionally impactful sequences in the film), but don't be surprised if this offering lets you down in other regards."

      "text": "Most people don't expect to walk out of a movie smarter than they walked in but seeing \"Denial\" not only entertains but teaches the audiences. Most Americans don't really know about the British court system but the main difference is that in America in libel cases the defendant is innocent until proven guilty while in England the defendant is guilty until they can prove their innocence.\rDeborah Lipstadt (Rachel Weisz) has written a just published book \"Denying The Holocaust\" portraying David Irving (Timothy Spall) as the holocaust denier he is and the latter claims she has ruined his career, cost him a loss of income and defamed him so sues her.\rThe \"Denial\" is based on a true story and the courtroom scenes are word for word from the actual trial records. Richard Rampton (Tom Wilkinson) defends her in court while Anthony Julius (Andrew Scott), who was Lady Diana's solicitor in her divorce, heads a team to prepare the case. Irving defends himself hoping to bring his denying the holocaust to more of the public and increasing his following while making his argument more valid. The outcome of the trial has a lot at stake on both sides and while some may go into the movie knowing the ending they will still get caught up in the trial.\rIt has been awhile since there has been a good trial movie and this fills that absence with both parties agreeing to the judge making the decision instead of the hearing being in front of a jury. His final decision is over a 300 page report and everyone in the audience where I was holding their breath and some even vocalizing at the decision.\rFrom the opening scene, where Irving confronts Lipstadt, giving a lecture in a full hall, to the last scene in \"Denial\", the film holds your attention and the three leads Weisz, Wilkinson and Spall are standouts, especially the latter who as a despicable person may make you shake your head back and forth but will hold you interest. The supporting cast doesn't have a less than worthy player.\rA film about the holocaust doesn't immediately bring laughter to mind but with Lipstadt, as a 'fish out of water', provides quite a few smiles and, in some cases outright laughter, as the differences in the ways of Americans and Brits, especially in the courtroom, come about naturally.\rWhile I wasn't so emotionally involved as I thought I would be I was more intellectually involved than I usually am with a movie.\rAn aside: I have finally found someone who has written, and keeps, more diaries than I did/have and he makes my collection look like nothing!"

      "text": "A courtroom drama about who's right and who's wrong!There are many factors to consider, especially for a film like this. Yep, the film was based on the real courtroom event. The film is about two people to prove they're right on their book about the war crimes whether that took place or not. So all the episodes take place in a British high court with mention of Auschwitz concentration camp, particularly about its ruins than the events that happened in there. That means it's a great drama to learn about how these two fought in a lawsuit face-off, but there's nothing about the real event just like the film 'The Eichmann Show'. If you are not a Jew or a neo nazi or not even a European and North American, then this is an okayish film from the entertainment aspect, other than learning truth and history.I really expected some real events, but we have already seen in many films about Auschwitz camp. So they kept this film as a modern day court trial than mixing up with those old crime. Great acting by all. Timothy Spall nailed it in his negative role. He was just a fine supporting actor, till I started to recognise him since his genius display in a biopic, 'Mr. Turner'. This is his one of the top performances. He could play Don Trump in his biopic, beside Rob Redford who's a bit old for that. Rachel Weisz was okay. Her role was not strong enough, despite she's in the main character. Because everyone around her took the honour to rise above hers. Be it Tom Wilkinson, who was surprisingly awesome.So in my perspective the film was good, but not great. The courtroom events lacked strong hold with what a film needs and what the viewers wants with twists and turns in the argument. But I'm very happy being honest than modifying its story to make film commercial worthy. Though the film had some its own moments, in the end it was not enough. Particularly how it concludes and to think why this trial even took place makes no sense at all. Seems more a joke than anything serious, just because of someone being crazily challenging and the other one responding to it. Anyway, it's still largely a sensitive matter and my view is just as an outsider. But the film is worth a watch, if you are not expecting a bigger picture after reading its synopsis.7/10"

      "text": "Very well acted for sure but what I love about this film is the accuracy. For the dialogue during the court room scenes, They use the actual recorded testimony from the trial and I felt that made this film all the better. They were truly spoken words from a sickening court case and they were among the best scenes of the film. And the filming at Auschwitz was very haunting.My only complaint was that despite being the lead role Weisz didn't have much dialogue or screen time. And she felt really out of character compared to everyone else on the cast. I probably would have re-cast the role and found someone to better fit the film."

What could possibly be the purpose of this movie? The premise of course is the continued perpetuation of the big lie. Spielberg basically gave Lipstadt a a legal warchest in the millions while Irving in over his head represented himself. The outcome was never in doubt and the lizard men win again."

Fans of Tom Wilkinson should definitely watch it, he has the most character development and the best moments. Timothy Spall, while his usual excellent self, portrays a one-dimensional character well; Rachel Weisz, trying on a bad American accent, portrays a one-dimensional character poorly. Add in a wandering screenplay and some directing that tries hard to be bleakly stylish, and Denial is a disappointment that doesn't rise above average. 5/10"

Este filme pouco percebido, devido o alto valor \u201cestimado\u201d dos filmes puramente comerciais em nosso pa\u00eds, \u00e9 uma narrativa que necessitamos ver, sentir e falar mais. Pois seu tema \u00e9 muito s\u00e9rio, e trata n\u00e3o apenas de um fato hist\u00f3rico ver\u00eddico, mas tamb\u00e9m de toda uma carga emocional, que algumas pessoas tendem a esquecer com o tempo (o HOLOCAUSTO). Sendo assim, confira nossa cr\u00edtica do filme Nega\u00e7\u00e3o.Rachel Weisz como a historiadora Deborah E. Lipstadt durante o julgamento no filme Nega\u00e7\u00e3o.Nega\u00e7\u00e3o, como diz em seu nome, trata do gigante julgamento entre a historiadora judia e tamb\u00e9m escritora Deborah Lipstadt junto a editora de seu livro Penguin Books e o falsificador de hist\u00f3ria e (pseudo)-\u201chistoriador auto-intitulado\u201d David Irving. Os dois travaram uma impressionante batalha jur\u00eddica em Londres referente a uma suposta difama\u00e7\u00e3o de Lipstadt para com Irving, quando esta em um de seus livros criticou a obra de Irving lhe colocando como negacionista do Holocausto.O filme traz de maneira dram\u00e1tica as disputas morais referente ao caso, trazendo o ego inflado de um adulterador da hist\u00f3ria contra uma verdadeira historiadora, que fez cr\u00edticas acad\u00eamicas a este. Tudo isso, trazendo \u00e0 tona, o velho revisionismo anti-semita e pr\u00f3-neonazista, que se reergue 20 anos depois da queda de Adolf Hitler. Discursos que homens como Irving tentam fazer com suas obras.Lipstadt e seu time de advogados e defensores ap\u00f3s o julgamento. Cena do filme Nega\u00e7\u00e3oO filme consegue trazer em seu roteiro, escrito em parte pela pr\u00f3pria historiadora Lipstadt (com base no seu livro \u201cHistory on Trial: My Day in Court With a Holocaust Denier\u201d, publicado em 2015) e David Hare (roteirista do filme A Oitava P\u00e1gina de 2001 e Sombras do Passado de 1985), na busca pelas provas do holocausto e das falsifica\u00e7\u00e3o da hist\u00f3ria de Irving, para ent\u00e3o livrar a historiadora do banco dos r\u00e9us e colocar Irving em seu devido lugar (longe das discuss\u00f5es acad\u00eamicas e s\u00e9rias sobre a hist\u00f3ria do holocausto).O longa dirigido por Mick Jackson (Volcano: a F\u00faria de 1997, Acusa\u00e7\u00e3o de 1995 e O Guarda-Costas de 1992) traz um conceito de filme real, que quase se compara a um document\u00e1rio atuado, tem di\u00e1logos fortes e cenas que impactam. N\u00e3o existe tomada aleat\u00f3ria, tudo se encaixa no contexto do julgamento, tudo demonstra o quanto estava em jogo naquele momento. Isso acabou por tornar o filme cansativo para uma massa casual, que n\u00e3o busca ver e sentir algo por um momento crucial da hist\u00f3ria (e n\u00e3o falo de um momento que vende como uma batalha \u00e9pica de cinema, mas aquele momento que ocorre em um tribunal ou na mente de um indiv\u00edduo, mas que importam e afetam a hist\u00f3ria).A briga de narrativas jur\u00eddicas s\u00e3o intensas, chegando a ser at\u00e9 (acredito eu) um bom filme para futuros advogados, que queiram assistir algo diferente e entender um pouco sobre o sistema judicial brit\u00e2nico, que alias ganha um bom punhado de tempo sendo explicado no longa. Tudo que aconteceu naqueles meses de julgamento foi esmiu\u00e7ado e dissecado neste filme de quase duas horas.Timothy Spall como David Irving durante o julgamento, cena do filme Nega\u00e7\u00e3o.Com um elenco diversificado e bastante competente, como a ganhadora do \u00f3scar Rachel Weisz (como Lipstadt), do indicado duas vezes tamb\u00e9m ao \u00f3scar Tom Wilkinson (como o advogado de Lipstadt, Richard Rampton) e do eterno Rabicho de Harry Potter Timothy Spall (como Irving). Foi poss\u00edvel captar esta intensa disputa pela verdade e tamb\u00e9m pela real justi\u00e7a, que ao colocar Lipstadt no banco dos r\u00e9us, colocou tamb\u00e9m em cheque todos os historiadores s\u00e9rios e todas as v\u00edtimas e sobreviventes do holocausto junto a ela.O filme trata t\u00e3o bem nosso momento hist\u00f3rico, que ele aborda quase no seu final outro tema importante nesse momento da era da p\u00f3s-verdade, que \u00e9 at\u00e9 onde vai a linha da liberdade de express\u00e3o real e a que abusa desta liberdade para ent\u00e3o mudar a hist\u00f3ria, trazer not\u00edcias falsas, manchar reputa\u00e7\u00f5es e responsabilizar algu\u00e9m pelo que ele realmente esta falando."
