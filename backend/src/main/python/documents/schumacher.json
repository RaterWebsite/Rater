      "text": "It's pretty good, sadly they do skip couple of stuff in his career, like they just go to his last title win also they skiped his return in 2010. Not saying that they should show everything since his return was bad except for his last season which he was pretty unucky with the car so they could at least showed a bit of that. Also no mention of Roland Ratzenberger in the bit with Senna. I know that Ratzenberger didn't achive as much of Senna but that the completly ignore him was pretty disrepectful."

      "text": "I thought it was good documentary, but it did miss some aspects and was more an homage than a proper in debt documentary - I mean I wanted to see more from the races as an F1 fan but this was more about Michael as a person"

      "text": "Very good movie about one of the greatest Formula 1 Pilots. The film perfectly captures the most important moments of his career. Including that final, fateful moment skiing in Meribel. Its worthy of watching.I rate it 8/10."
