Entirely unoriginal. I thought that some of the art direction was beautiful (moon over the meadow or the scrap yard), but the character animation was total garbage, especially the two male (!) cows. I go to see the new CGI movies to see the latest and greatest the technology has to offer, but this movie took a few steps backwards. Cars characters looked amazing, almost real, it amazed me throughout (even though it was sloooow). Not the same case here. Some bits are pretty funny, but overall; boring, repetetive, been-there, done-that. We'lll have to wait for Flushed Away to see something original. Don't waste your time or money. We don't need a Barnyard 2."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Not appropriate for children. My 1st comment when watching the movie was \"hey\" why do the male cows have udders - why weren't the 2 main characters bulls?? I didn't like the movie and don't think it's for kids."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "This cartoon will entertain the young children and was generally okay. Even the male cows had utters which was weird and wrong. There are scenes both at the \"bar\" and in a driving sequence which seem to promote drinking and are rather inappropriate. Overall it did have decent, although unoriginal, messages. I would not pay for my family to see this at the theatre, maybe rent it as it won't take long for this to go to DVD."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "Not very funny, not even the children watching the moving laughed at all. The story took a long time to get going and is a very similar theme as many movies before it. They used male cows which don't exist. It woiuld have made more sense if the \"male\" cows were bulls and leave the cows as they are female. The music was okay the whole thing just was not entertaining at all."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I thought this movie was adorable. It was light hearted and fun.

Aside from the biological mistakes and crude drawings, I felt like I had to \"debrief\" the children I went with about the horrifying stereotypes and poor decision making in the film [***SPOILERS***] (the animals steal, drink, joy ride, break and enter, behave violently, and do other things that are not cool--all presented in the film as harmless fun). The presentation of all rural folks as either uneducated/stupid, crazy, or alcoholic was anything but charming. For most parts of the film that were intended to be jokes, the theater filled with kids was silent. And this is sad, but being a knitter, the presentation of knitting was so inaccurate that it was actually irritating to watch."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I expected it to be funny and witty.

I didn't know until recently that the weird TV series started as a movie, so I was curious, and while it's not as original as Flushed Away or as well animated as Shrek, essentially, it's few steps behind. This movie is neck and neck with Over the Hedge as the best animated film of 2006 in my opinion and some of the best talking animal movies I've seen. Not only does this movie put the fun back in being an independent farmer, but the main characters are very developed and memorable. The secondary characters, not as much."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Believe it or not, \"Barnyard\" isn't the worst animated movie in existence! In fact, it's actually not even that bad! Sure, it came out in a Summer that was competitive for animated films and probably suffered from the glut of films, but it was still relatively entertaining. Occasionally charming, considerably funny and featuring some pretty solid characters, \"Barnyard\" is a considerably decent film. Sure, it's nothing amazing, but if you have kids, they might like it."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Actually is one of the best movies I ever see in my life.Otis is a good dude and Biggie cheese.

But the only thing I will agree that helps a little with watching it for god sack is the soundtrack, the music itself is outstandingly good, the rock to it is done very well as John Debney knows that even if it's a bad film, he can takes his free cash knowing he did his job right when everyone else feels like they know what to do but actually no."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "So, this film is a masterpiece of the 3d animations, it has a emotional view of the society and the relation of son and dad, it made me cry 2 times and this is hard."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Biggie Cheese singing Mr. Bombastic is the best thing ever and also you can tell that this movie's aged very badly, when Otis is using a **** flip up phone."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This is one of the greatest films ever.
