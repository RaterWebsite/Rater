One or two of the action scenes may be a bit incredible, but I think that if you go in to a movie like this wanting strictly reality, you're missing the point of just sitting back and losing yourself in a bit of emotional fun for a while.

The best movie about 2020 with the most bland un-helpful title ever.If you dislike Michael Bay films, this is before he went wild and destruction-crazy with too much money to spend.  This is the more restrained, more story-driven Michael Bay. If you, like me in 2020, believe a normal year of flu was blown up into a pandemic scare and flawed then criminally prolonged shutdown of the economy.  This has every feature you would want in a fable where the sheeple wake up and do become pro-active about taking power back into their own lives.  The waking-up sheeple are aided and supported by a Black Lives Matter villain who becomes their supporter.  I saw it in 2005, loved it.  Watched it again in Oct 2020.  Ten times more more timely and relevant now than in 2005.  Top drawer acting, directing and special effects.  Alex Kurtzman, the current head of Star Trek on CBS, was one of the writers.  This is another of his excellent earlier efforts. You will see many well-known actors at their peak or early roles here, a welcome sight.  This has one of the most fun, car destruction derby  scenes ever made.  Yes, this is the one where the roll heavy rail train wheels off the back of a truck into on-coming bad-guy traffic.  Classic and rarely if ever excelled. Q:  Why did it only make its production cost back in 2005?A:  I think its was too far ahead of its time.  It's also a long movie with a slow build-up to much third act action.  I think what was learned from scripts like this was to start off with some action even if you have to go back and slow down to build up to the climax."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "\u00b0\u300b\u00b0\u300b\u00b0\u300b\u00b0\u300b\u00b0\u300b\u00b0\u300b\u00b0\u300b\u00b0\u300b\u00b0\u300b\u00b0\u300b\u00b0\u300b\u00b0\u300b\u00b0\u300b\u00b0\u300b\u00b0\u300b\u00b0\u300b\u00b0\u300b\u00b0\u300b\u00b0\u300b\u00b0\u300b\u00b0\u300b\u00b0@;@;@;@;@;@;@@;@;@;@;@;@;@;@;@:@:@:@:@:@:@:@:@:@:@:@:@@:"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\",\",\",\",\",\",\",\",\",\",\",\".\".+,+,@,+,\u00f7,#,#,#,=,,$,$,=,....."}, {"rating": "10", "text": ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%"}], "recommendations": ["edge_of_tomorrow", "top_gun_maverick", "mad_max_fury_road", "top_gun", "unstoppable", "brick_mansions", "transformers_dark_of_the_moon", "skyscraper", "the_terminator", "transformers", "angel_has_fallen", "poseidon", "san_andreas", "gemini_man", "avengers_age_of_ultron", "the_magnificent_seven", "blackhat", "armageddon", "the_bourne_ultimatum", "the_guardian", "bloodshot", "jaws", "thor_ragnarok", "into_the_storm", "infinite"]}
