I never knew Efron could do comedy like this.Thomas Lennon steals the show as his rich but nerdy best friend who pretends to be his father. Matthew Perry still shows the same attitude as his character Chandler friends and Leslie Mann is a Darling in this film showing that she is more than someone in a Judd Apatow comedy. while it's not up there with other great comedy films, it's not at the bottom of the barrel Rob Schnider type of comedy either.I'd rent it first before you consider it worthy of your movie collection though."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Every teen generation needs a good body swap/turn the clock back type of story and 17 again is one of those stories, Mike O'Donnell had it all. He was the star of his high schools basket ball team. He had Scarlet the most beautiful girl in the school as his girlfriend. Right before the game that could make him into a star, Scarlet tells Mike she's pregnant, Mike makes a drastic and life altering decision and runs out of the game to be with her giving up his chances of becoming a basket ball star, now 20 years later Mike's regretting it all and wishes he could do it all over again, and by some miraculous way he does. 17 again is a cool and stylish what if movie, brings to light the question of what if you could change your life, if you could live it all over again.What would you do different? That's the question this movie propose and tells with a grand lush style that resonates with the teen population and even with the adults too, 17 again is not just some teen movie, it's a movie that even adults between the ages of 30-50 would enjoy it, my dad sure did. But this film has it's flaws and some very minor bad dialogue from Zack Efron but nothing that would hamper this films style or production, but in my honest opinion this film was very good, this movie is not oscar worthy but it's definitely worth the price of admission."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "An awesome film about Mike O'Donnell (Zac efron) getting to be 17 again as he has wasted his teenage life, and wanted to re-do this particular part of his life.

Now you know it's gonna suck!.....THAT's what you think when you hear about this movie, but if you actually see it, it's an absoloute friggin' MASTERPIECE! :D It's actually one of the best movies I've ever seen, and this portrays Zac Efron in a new light and shows us that he can actually act! :) Plus, Judd Apatow's wife Leslie Mann is in this, so that's an extra bonus! :D!"}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Some middle-aged guy gets to be 17 again.

Also the incest-not-incest kiss or lack thereof??? Jeeeeez, can we ask for a little bravery in film? What am i saying, it's a neo-kkkon movie delivering a neo-kkkon message Palin could be proud of (if she had the brains to understand even this hamburger, junkfood type movie) so, bravery? too much too ask for. 2 points for good supporting roles, although LOTR geeks? that's sooo nineties!"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Surprisingly great, great acting, likable characters, and a good sense of humor make this movie shine, while it does have some flaws here and there with the conclusion (as you never see how he makes things right between him and his kids) as long as you don't over think it, you'll find this an extremely enjoyable comedy."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Zac Efron says he doesn't want to be stereotyped as a high school student.

It isn't perfect in its execution and script but the theme, the theme is brilliant. I think it shows how little age means in reality. I think this movie is just a foretaste of the possibilities that will come with the rapidly approaching technological tsunami. People, fasten your seat belts and lead the instruction manual in front on the seat in front of you because we're shifting into high gear. But it's not only about that. It's a movie that manages to cut through the usual cliches and kitschy depictions of reality and show some really good values and ideals. And it is really very funny most of the time. This is after all a teenage and young adult comedy hybrid. I applaud the effort and the result."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "It's surprisingly good light hearted and very funny movie for me.. espeacially the Ned character, Hilarious! hahaha!"}, {"rating": "4", "text": "It was such an obviously poor copy of the themes in Back To The Future and Its A Wonderful Life.

I know it is typical for a teenager to like it, but even my dad, mom, and little brother liked it.

Can somebody tell what the scret to his demoness is?"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "The name of the high school is Hayden. Mike O'Donnell(Zac Efron) went there, circa 1989. That was the year Hayden Panettiere was born. That was also the year Nirvana recorded its debut album \"Bleach\" for Sub Pop. The target audience reads Hayden one way, while an older demographic group, especially those who love music, may read the name of the high school as a morose Neil Young-like Canadian singer-songwriter, who records confessional songs on his own label called Hardwood. Mike was a basketball star, and hardwood just happens to be the playing surface of most indoor basketball courts. Now let's talk about Mike. In David Seltzer's \"Lucas\", Charlie Sheen plays Cappie, the jock who protects the titular bespectacled insect collector from bullies. Similar to Cappie, the point guard had befriended Ned, the waterboy, a nerd, as Lucas was(Mike also befriends his nerd son). The same goes for Hayden, in all likelihood. Incidentally, Ned's last name is Gold(Thomas Lennon). Neil Young's best-loved song just happens to be \"Heart of Gold\". Meanwhile, the closest that Hayden got to mainstream acceptance was the college radio hit \"Girl of my Dreams\"(from his major label debut \"Everything I Long For\"), and in \"17 Again\", the nerd tycoon meets the girl of his dreams to hillarious effect. \"17 Again\", it must be said, is funny: arguably, even more so than the much hipper \"Adventureland\"(the M.C. Hammer dance tops \"Rock me Amadeus\" for time capsule honors, anyday). But it's unchallenging and predictable; \"17 Again\" breaks no new ground with this shopworn premise. For instance, when Mike's daughter gets amorous with the parental fresh-faced oldster, naturally, he rebuffs her advances. Interestingly enough, though, the daughter's name is Maggie(Michelle Trachtenberg), the same as Kerri Green's character from \"Lucas\". She and Cappie were an item. Since Mike is Cappie-like, a humble big man on campus, a referential subtext of lust for his daughter is able to fly under the radar."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I thought the critics were a bit harsh on 17 Again. In my opinion, there was not one part of the movie where I wasn't entertained. And those kinds of movies are hard to come by nowadays. Two thumbs up! (Also, Zac Efron actually played his role well. I wasn't expecting that from him, after being tramatized by *gulp* High School Musical.)"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "This was the worst advertised film ever. Whenever I saw a trailer for this film all I could think was 'Oh joy, Zac Efron has a vanity project.' But I was very happily suprised. First, he can actually act! That was a massive shock. Also, he didn;t steal the spotlight as much as I expected. Granted he was the lead role but he didn;t overshadow any of the other talent in the film like Perry and Trachtenberg.

Maybe I am just at the right age for it (I was 17 when I saw this) but it is hilarious. Zac Efron is surprisingly likable, possibly aided by the fact he is meant to be a lot older.

But for literally no reason at all, the main character Mike apparently has some kind of fairy godmother who takes the form of a janitor (this is never really explained... ever). This eventually leads to him falling off of a bridge into a magical whirlpool and then turning...You guessed it... 17 again.

The soundtrack is excellent, and the script is surprisingly decent with just the right amount of quirky humour. The direction is good, while the acting is not bad at all. The characters are a little clich\u00e9d admittedly, but the actors do their best to make the most of their characters. Zac Efron gives a great performance in the lead and fits perfectly with the film's tone. Matthew Perry and Leslie Mann are both good too, but it is Efron's film all the way.Overall, not bad actually quite enjoyable. 7/10 Bethany Cox"}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Super predictable story but there was enough funny moments for it not to be a complete waste of time."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Tiene una historia divertida y entretenida, adem\u00e1s, la interpretaci\u00f3n de Zac Efron es bastante buena."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Good comedy.
