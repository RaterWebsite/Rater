I believe the film succinctly portrays the essence and spirit of the Apollo 11 mission in its nearest raw state, without the added drama and chatter found in mainstream reproductions. I also sense the director and editor have taken time to give the film a \"consistent look,\" which again is contrary to the archetypal \"cut-n-paste\" documentaries. I believe this film has provided inclusive excellence with added emphasis of the control room (the heart of the mission) and incorporates diversity in the spectators and those behind the scenes. The score of the film is contemporary, which I think those from the generation of the mission might find awkward and distracting. All-in-all, I found the film inspiring, revitalizing, and aesthetically pleasing."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This is an amazing documentary film about the moon landing. There\u2019s no narration, no interviews, nothing. Just the footage, as well as a musical score. It speaks for itself. It just tells the story of the moon landing using footage of the mission. The editing is fantastic. It actually manages to construct a compelling narrative with nothing but old footage. Speaking of the footage, it\u2019s all in colour and in HD. It\u2019s actually pretty incredible. It looks like footage that was shot recently, not over 50 years ago. I don\u2019t know if most of the footage is new (as in unreleased until now) or not, but it was fascinating to watch. If you love space travel and astronomy, this is a must-watch. Even if you aren\u2019t that into space exploration, I think this might be the definitive documentation of one of the most important cultural events of the 20th century. Go watch it. It\u2019s excellent. It\u2019s not very long either, it\u2019s a very easy watch. Just do it."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Off to an early start with an 8:30 A.M. screening of Todd Douglas Miller's (Dinosaur 13) Apollo 11, a Neon Production and CNN Film, this morning at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival's MARC Theatre. And, I wasn't disappointed. Miller and his team gained access to the National Archives and Records Administration as well as the NASA archives for their project and I was happy to see another space film after covering Rory Kennedy's Above and Beyond: NASA's Journey To Tomorrow this past summer at AFI DOCS in Washington D.C.Crafted from a newly discovered trove of 65mm footage, and more than 11,000 hours of uncatalogued audio recordings, Miller takes us straight to the heart of NASA\u2019s most celebrated mission with masterful editing and grand storytelling - the one that first put men on the moon, and forever made Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin into household names.Astronaut Buzz Aldrin shortly before going into orbit on the Apollo 11 Space Mission. (Photo courtesy of Neon)Immersed in the perspectives of the astronauts, the team in Mission Control, and the millions of spectators on the ground, Apollo 11 provided the audience with a look from inside the Apollo 11 spacecraft, the jocular banter of the astronauts as well as the adoring crowds and the tense atmospherics inside Mission Control. Miller delivers a vivid experience of those momentous days and hours in 1969 when humankind took a giant leap into the future fulfilling President Kennedy's May, 1961 mission of sending a man to the moon utilizing still black and white, and color photographs, newsreel voice-overs and the stunning cinematography treasures captured during the 1969 mission.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXuV7XbZvU]With never seen-before footage and a run time of ninety minutes, the film covers nine days in an efficient manner. Miller, a self-described space geek, weaves a warm, emotionally fulfilling narrative with a strong sound design from Eric Milano and riveting music from Matt Morton highlighted with moments from the preparation, liftoff, landing, return and recovery of the famed mission.But, he could not have managed it without the expert skills of Stephen Slater, a specialist in the NASA film archive, and nominee for the Arthur C Clarke Award for Achievement in Space Media,  who had the dubious distinction of syncing the audio for all the soundless archival footage (as none of the footage had any sound!), and Ben Feist, a software engineer at NASA, and the Apollo program historian behind the interactive website Apollo17.org, a web experience that recreates the last mission to the Moon in real-time, who created algorithms to streamline the massive audio files. Lastly, all the 16mm and 35mm archival footage was scanned and converted into a large screen format, 4K, utilizing a one-of-a-kind, prototype scanner.Director Todd Douglas Miller addresses the audience following his 2019 Sundance Film Festival Apollo 11 screening at the MARC Theatre in Park City, Utah, on January 25th. (Photo credit: Larry Gleeson/HollywoodGlee)In the Q & A following the screening, Miller  playfully referred to Apollo 11 as the 'Dunkirk in space' and provided insightful background on how these stored film reels came into being as the failed attempt of MGM and NASA to produce a film together. Miller confessed to always wanting to make a big screen film. Apollo 11 is in the U.S. Documentary Competition and seems to be one of the crowd favorites so far.This is a must-see film!"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "\u201cHouston. Tranquility Base here, the Eagle had landed.\u201dApollo 11 is a great film that shows viewers the Moon Landing of 1969 like no other movie before. It has great background information and it shows the crew pretty accurately. Apollo 11 has the original videos of 1969, and by having these makes the film historically accurate. Apollo 11 is a historical film that I would recommend to anyone."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This film is an experience, as dramatic as any fiction and ultimately far more meaningful because it is real.  I recommend it as much as possible for literally everyone.  It is a masterful blend of original footage, simple animations, and modern film technique that carries you along like a thrill ride while almost subliminally conveying how complex, dangerous, and massive a project this was.The pacing is almost perfect: the buildup to launch is like a movie in itself and leaves you amazed at what they did before it even lifts off.  Each key milestone of the voyage gets a countdown and graphic explanation, and as the movie goes on and you just start to get tired they pick up the pace so it ends with you not quite wanting it to be over yet.   In general the use of music/sound is really effective at conveying the danger and significance of events, my only real knock is that occasionally it was so loud it obscured actual speech I wanted to hear better - especially during the actual landing sequence.This is the 50th anniversary and you really owe it to yourself and your kids to see this now while it is out on Imax.  You could watch it at home on TV, but no matter how big your TV or how loud your speakers it won't be the same.  More people around the world watched Apollo 11 than any other event in history, and there's something to be said for seeing it with a crowd of other people.    An unrelated observation from the film: I found it eye opening that even though Nixon was a straight up crook, he still understood what it meant to be president and made truly presidential remarks, to say nothing of the clips of JFK.  It really puts into perspective where we are as a nation today."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Produced more audible Wow!'s and Whoa!'s from the audience than any movie I've ever seen in theaters -- and got a standing ovation.

It stands at a towering 363 feet tall\u2014longer than a football field\u2014weighs six and a half million pounds, and totals nearly ten million pounds of thrust.Sitting atop that behemoth, as is so vividly and viscerally depicted in \u2018Apollo 11,\u2019 are three astronauts, each with an unmatched combination of expertise and indomitability that has afforded them the opportunity to be blasted 238,900 miles into space to become the first humans to set foot on the moon.It\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve been in a theater where the audience applauded multiple times throughout the screening.  \u2018Apollo 11\u2019 deserves it.  The film celebrates the very best of the American spirit and serves as a visceral reminder of what humanity can achieve when we direct our time, effort, and resources towards the noble pursuits of science, technology, and engineering.From a filmmaking perspective, \u2018Apollo 11\u2019 hits all the right notes.  The graphics are poignant in their minimalism, demonstrating the various maneuvers the crew needs to fulfill in order to achieve their mission.  The sound design follows suit, allowing the film to breathe at certain times, while ramping up the tone and tension whenever appropriate.\u2018Apollo 11\u2019 must be seen during the limited time it will remain in theaters.  And while even a large screen and booming sound system can\u2019t quite fully capture the extraordinary magnitude of what space exploration entails, this documentary is certainly the closest many of us will ever come to experiencing it."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Using a surprisingly large amount of existing footage of the Apollo 11 Moon landing, including the spaceship, NASA, and even the Texas unit responsible for picking the astronauts up safely, this documentary offers what is a thorough beat-by-beat depiction of the monumental event.I thought this was going to be a look-back with modern-day interviews and narration, but nope, none of that. Only narration is some from the news footage of the launch. Any supplemental information is supplied by text and infographics of the space flight. I was pleasantly surprised by this. It really makes you feel like you're there in '69. I also learned stuff I never knew before like the multiple teams utilized by NASA for different aspects of the mission and the fact that the astronauts had to be immediately quarantined after the flight.The whole thing looks and sounds great. (Though admittedly, I saw this in IMAX, which probably helps.) The digital restoration of those bright seventy colors really makes the thing pop. The audio for the launching rockets are really loud and completely capture the experience. The dramatic music really accentuates the dramatic tone of the mission. Only downside is that they play the same music during the ending credits which consists of footage celebrating the conquering heroes. It completely doesn't match what you see. It makes you feel like you're about to see a downer twist ending like a deadly organism sneaked along with the mission or the astronauts were killed and replaced by duplicates because they knew too much. A downside is that a lot of this film is people at panels. I did lose attention a couple times.If you can't do slow-paced, this might be not for you. However, if you're interested in how the very first moon landing actually went down then this is exactly what you're looking for.

It was truly amazing!My one and only complaint is about the incompetent fool who decided that this wonderfully illustrated piece of history needed that god-awful mood music, especially during launch and engine-firing sequences, and especially that insanely stupid heartbeat thump during countdowns. Apart from drowning out the voices I so desperately strained to hear, it also severely detracted from the events themselves.I would LOVE to see this again, but only if that god-awful mood music could be stripped out."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "An unfiltered documentary that really makes you feel like you there.

One thing I miss in films like this are interviews with the astronauts. I can't believe they don't exist. You never get a sense of what these guys might be feeling \u2013 or were they chosen because they wouldn\u2019t feel (in this documentary, they kept reporting heart beat rates but not much else). The pictures were the stunners here, and the event was covered in minute detail. Although Neil Armstrong's smile is charming, I preferred \u201cFirst Man,\u201d even though I found that disappointing too."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "An expertly crafted account of the epic 1969 moon landing mission that relies exclusively on footage and sound bites from the time, with no enlargement or reinterpretation from the period that followed. The film effectively captures the look and feel not only of the event, but also of the times in which it took place. For those of us old enough to remember those historic times, it's both nostalgic and prideful, reminding viewers of a time when the country truly was great and its people had something to believe in, words to the wise for those of us living in a time that's a shadow of what it once was."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This movie was a joy to watch.

It\u2019s a tribute to those who crafted this documentary that a NASA mission - whose outcome is so well-known (spoiler alert: these guys land on the moon) - could hold an audience\u2019s attention without resorting to any sort of contrivance (like Ryan Gosling\u2019s angst-filled brooding, I\u2019m looking at you \u201cFirst Man\u201d).This is unadorned documentary film-making at its finest.  There\u2019s no voiceover by James Earl Jones.  No \u201cwe were there\u201d interviews.  No contemporary astrophysicists or scientists giving us context.  Director Todd Douglas Miller (2014 Emmy for \u201cDinosaur 13\u201d) has had the self-confidence to simply go through an abundance of restored 65mm film and over 11,000 hours of rediscovered audio recordings and stitch together a powerful, compelling narrative.Without seeing this movie, you may find it hard to imagine that this story could be either emotionally compelling or visually interesting.  If you\u2019re familiar with the TV broadcast footage from the lunar landing in its grainy black-and white, it\u2019s even harder to believe this movie could hold your interest.  But it does.  Actually, some of the color footage is breathtaking.  Composer Matt Morton\u2019s powerful underscoring contributes to the overall mood.What makes this documentary possible is the vast number of cameras that were deployed for every step of this mission.  At lift-off, we\u2019re given an amazingly close-up perspective of the power of the Saturn rockets.  When parts of the rocket are jettisoned during the flight, there is up-close footage, including an amazing perspective from inside a discarded booster rocket that shows the capsule carrying the astronauts speeding away.  On the moon, a color camera taking images one frame per second has created some shots that are simply breath-taking.  One of Miller\u2019s most effective themes is the sheer magnitude of this space mission - in size, in scope and in the scale of this undertaking.  The film opens with a close-up of the giant crawler-transporter that moves the 363-foot rocket onto the launch pad.  (This transport vehicle weighs over 6 million pounds and requires 30 technicians, crew and drivers to operate.  Some claim it\u2019s so large it has its own weather.)  It\u2019s an excellent metaphor for the size of this undertaking.  This archival footage also captures the scope of the audience - the tens of thousands of spectators assembled in the area because they wanted to see lift-off with their own eyes.  (We\u2019re also shown, without commentary, that the hair styles and clothing choices of the late 60\u2019s were a series of self-inflicted, unfortunate events.)A second powerful theme is the self-deprecating understatement of all involved.  At liftoff, telemetry reported that Buzz Aldrin\u2019s heart rate was what many people experience while sleeping.  When Michael Collins\u2019 respiratory sensors stopped functioning, Collins assured Mission Control he would inform them immediately, if he stopped breathing.  In its own way, this film is just as interesting as the latest films based on comic book heroes.  \u201cApollo 11\u201d chronicles compellingly one of the \u201cgiant leaps\u201d in human history."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Stunning.
