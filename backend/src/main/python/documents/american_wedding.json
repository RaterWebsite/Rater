      "text": "Another Fun and entertaining entry to the most amazing series!it was not as great as prequels but good movie!the music and soundtracks were phenomenal and great,the acting was amazing love the new characters Cadence,the Gay guy and the whole family,the story was usual decent.the situations right from the start was multiplied than prequels it felt little overdone but it was awesome,right from the start the propose scene,the dog's intro the start was hilarious AF,the Stifler was literally the legendary character ever the guy's laugh and the jokes were amazing as hell he was great entertainer,the whole side story of Stifler's caring about wedding and the ignorance of Jim and the efforts till last he was literally great throughout the movie the Gay bar dance,the cake scene it was disgustingly awesome,the bachelor party and the whole faking character thing with Cadence with at the end the flower's scene it was the awesome thing,the shave thing and the grandma's thing was disgustingly hilarious the ending was literally amazing with again Stifler's mom entry and Finch's move with the 2 dudes watching it was awesome as hell,Overall it was little disappointing as per the wedding of Jim's and the 1 member in group was missing and it was't even mentioned anywhere and all other characters were have to be there Nadia,Sherminator and all the other one's couple's but no mentions of them,apart from that it was weakest in franchise but it was damn hilarious and fun and entertaining movie!"

      "text": "American Wedding keeps the franchise balanced. The whole American Pie series just continues to produce consistently solid comedy films. There is really nothing out there like the American Pie films. I like that they took more time to focus on Stifler in this movie it was like he was the main character after being in the backseat in previous movies. American Wedding is full of all the crude, gross but creative humour you can stand and in the end you'll never feel as if you've wasted your time."

There are so many funny moments, especially scenes involving stiffler. The dance scene in the night club is absolutely hilarious. If you want to watch a film that has a feel good vibe and will keep you laughing I would highly recommend watching."

      "text": "With the participation of Shannon Elizabeth, \"American Wedding\" would've had a better monkey wrench than dead flowers to thwart the wedding. Herz suggests what a Nadia-fueled \"American Wedding\" would look like during a pre-wedding jitters rap session between Jim and his dad. Sean William Scott owns this movie. Giving Jim dance lessons was a nice touch. When Stifler eats dog poop, it's funnier than it has any right to be because he's a well-developed character."

      "text": "I laughed, I laughed some more, I almost threw up, and laughed some more.I gave this movie a 10 out of 10 because for a comedy it made me laugh continuously. Not a minute was wasted. Even if the situation was totally absurd, as many were, the conviction of the actors in their roles was enough to keep it going. Stiffler and Finch's rivalry reached new highs and lows in this one as they compete for the affections of Michelles virgin little sister Cadence. Fred Willards addition in this third movie was welcome, even if his role was subtle.I can't think of anything bad to say about this movie. The plots were simple but believable.. How complex can a wedding story be anyways. It made sense, it was funny, it was definately funnier than the second american pie movie.. im not going to say it was funnier than the first but I definately laughed longer and harder in this one. Well done. Plus Alyson Hannigan is somehow getting hotter as the movies progress.."
