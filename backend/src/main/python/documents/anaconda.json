Ice Cube is dire. Why was Eric Stolz in it? TAll would be forgivable if the snake was any good. But it\u2019s not. The animatronics are terrible."

      "text": "Is it perfect? No is it a cinematic masterpiece? No, but I love this film because it's self aware of it's absurdity and screenwriters Hans Bauer, Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr. and director Luis Llosa point that out very nicely. What I also love about the film is Ice Cube's over the top performance but it's stirring and SPOILER ALERT! Your gonna enjoy this film more when your about to see Cube killing a snake , Jennifer Lopez's   performance was okay, this film isn't well made yes it is mediocre but the snake effects are laughable but Llosa does a bland job but good at the same time making this film cheesy but enjoyable at the same time. Jon Voight (who looks like Christopher Walken) does a creepy but good job as the snake expert/villain. Jennifer Lopez plays Terri Flores a documentary filmmaker her and crew go deep into the Amazon Jungle to shoot this documentary about the People of The Mist-- a legendary lost Amazon tribe. Terri is directing the documentary. Ice Cube plays Danny, her cinematographer. Eric Holtz is Dr. Steven Cale a scientist.  The members include Johnathan Hyde as the British narrator, Owen Wilson plays the sound man, Vincent Castellanos as the sinister pilot, and Kari Wuhrer as the production assistant. They pick a guy called Paul Sarone (John Voight) from a sinking boat. He offers to help in Terri and her crew to search for the Amazon tribe Paul, but he's actually a snake hunter looking for the big legendary anaconda snake that's a fortune. Since \"Anaconda\" is a action-adventure film, you can find some hilarious moments at this film, but overall cheesy fun B-movie. 4.5 out of 5 stars"

It isn't especially violent and there is no nudity but Jennifer is looking mighty fine so it is all good. I quite enjoyed it as there is no thought power required. One of the best giant snake movies and with that title comes pure cheesiness."

      "text": "It's a fun film. Is it super fantastic, kick-ass, best film of all time, classic? No, not really. The best part is watching Jon Voight trying to capture the snake, then running away, then getting swalloed whole by it. Yeah, that was cool. Not many scenes that are as memorable, though, but for those that are looking for a good creature feature after crap like Python and Some gator and croc flicks, see this. Better than the sequel, which, these days, after excellent films like Batman, but its even more kick-ass sequel, begins, and Spider-Man 2, you can't really say alot."

      "text": "The special effects were terrible, well for 90% of the film. I started off OK and until half way through it was a decent watch, but the film caved in on its own complications. They went too far and over the top towards the end to the point where you were almost certain the snake/jon voight was going to somehow survive the attacks that would certainly have killed them had the film been sem-realistic. Jon Voight was regurgitated and a snake survived being blown up. I'll give this a 4 down to some good performances from Lopez and Voight and a good start.- Had it not been for the deterioration near the end this would get a 7."

The special effects don\u2019t particularly hold up, but with J-Lo and Ice Cube doing their thing and Jon Voight putting in an entertaining turn, it makes for an hour and a half of dumb fun."

      "text": "\"Anaconda\". It's big, it's scary    it's underwhelming. Yeah, I was surprised, but this movie really felt kinda empty and boring. The anaconda wasn't very threatening, the action and suspense wasn't very gripping, and the only redeeming qualities were some decent acting and a few moments of fun special effects  almost all of which they seemed to save for the last act. I was interrupted about halfway through it, and nearly didn't bother finishing it  not a good sign for a movie. Overall, it's not terrible, but it's sure not terribly memorable either. More of a snakeskin than a real snake."

      "text": "That said, Anaconda is not bad enough to be one of the worst movies ever made. The tropical scenery is splendid, the snakes are impressive and the premise while daft was at least interesting. However, if I were to coin the phrase \"absolute poppycock\" I would give it to Anaconda. The story was interesting in its concept but it is very predictable with some unbearably silly scenes. Anaconda is also quite poorly paced, sometimes it drags, sometimes it feels rushed. The script is very cheesy and clumsy, and the characters are shallow. The direction is rather murky, and the acting is pretty dire. Jennifer Lopez is very bland in her role here, while Jon Voight is annoying and just awful with a very poorly written character, complete with a horrendous accent(not quite Superbabies:Baby Geniuses 2 horrendous, but still it was dreadful). So overall, it is not good. 3/10 Bethany Cox"
