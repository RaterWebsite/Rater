This is latest entry into the fast-growing kick-ass chicks genre, like the recent Amazon release Jolt.

But the more advances, the more loses all the good stuffs."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "(Mauro Lanari)Why label an exploitation film as action, once again produced by Leitch with 10 or 20 stunt performers for each actor, gory, sanguinary and proud not to give a damn about the plot?

Who texts confirmation messages to her next hit the day before the hit? Her tactics is also very amateur, Taking a sniper shot from kneling position is way worse than a prone position when she has the opportunity to do so.The car chase scene in this movie is also dreadfully bad, totally sped up and fake AF. It is entirely CGI and a very bad rendered one at that.Woody Harrelson has a central, but not so present role. But he can not rescue this movie one bit.Overall, this movie left me with a bad taste metal in my mouth.."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "This movie is ridiculous.

Still, a relatively by the numbers revenge action flick kept me entertained."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "This movie might show Harrelson in all of the promos. But know that he is basically in the movie for 10 minutes tops.The lead does a great job, no doubt about that. But I love Harrelson, and was quite disappointed that he is basically only on there to attract attention to the movie.Now, about the movie itself. It's not bad, but it is quite boring. Halfway through I was looking at the time, and realized how much was left. That's when my mind started drifting. The movie simply couldn't keep my interest.There are some pretty well-choreographed fighting scenes in there. But the plot is a run-of-the-mill revenge story. And since non-stop action isn't all that interesting in itself, it has to rely on the between-fights interactions. And that's where it starts falling flat about halfway through. And it never seems to be able to pick itself back up."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "A shallow wannabe John Wick imitation, of course with Netflix-style obligatory dose of childish feminism and ham-fisted \"female empowerment\", painted with garish colors and inept strokes on the overused backdrop of modern Yakuza-riddled Japan.

Her action sequences, fighting style, emotions, physical look indeed everything is superb. She makes the movie engaging till the end.Visually this movie is excellent. The Cinematography, fighting sequences and direction is superb. I loved this movie."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "It seems like they're churning out these John Wick style assassin revenge films in a factory somewhere. We've seen this a hundred times already. It's bland, generic, and cliched.  The action - the gunplay is passable, but the hand to hand combat doesn't work. The reactions of the stunt people are over-exaggerated in relation to how hard the hits look. I did like a lot of the Japanese aesthetic and style; and Mary Elizabeth-Winstead is really solid in this; she's not convincing as an action start to me."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Ein sehr spannender Film.

I'd say 8 is a fair score.  It's a really enjoyable popcorn movie that is done really well.  The girl is a really natural and good actor, would be interested to see what else she can do if given a meatier role.  Very entertaining."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Not bad, it's a shame that there will be no sequels.Mary is not the best choice for an action hero as she does not have the training for much of the stunts, it is noticeable in this film but she does an alright job.Obviously this is a comparison to (Reeves & Theron) who are miles better and trained for the genre. The only thing I can find fault is Ani (Miku Martineau) just seems to instantly forgive Kate for the assassination of her father... being provided with a bombshell of an event should have more weight than it does here.Lastly, there seems to be a desire to recreate films that are the basis of inspiration. ie: La Femme Nikita, L\u00e9on the Professional, John Wick, and Atomic Blonde."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "KATE is a John Wick-lite with not a lot of meat on it's bones other than how much ass it kicks. At times the cinematography shines, at others a adrenaline fueled action set piece will drop in your lap out of nowhere, but in the end it runs maybe a tad too long. It's plot is simple but the action is great. Then last but most certainly not least, is the always amazing Mary Elizabeth Winstead. She is wicked and looked like she was having a blast. Woody Harrelson gives us the classic **** bag but, really, he is outshined but everything else going on. Outlandish but fun."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Look, based on its limited ambitions, I would say that the ceiling on this movie was an 8, so I consider the 7 a pretty high mark.  This was a competently executed action flick with some very well done cinematography and acting from Winstead.  I felt compelled to write a review because now that I've seen I find the critical response totally baffling.  If you're looking for a grim, stark, satisfying action movie, you'll find it here."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "FU critics. I've almost skipped this gem because of low score reviews. The scenes are amazing, camera men did pro job, Tokyo is beautiful, acting is superb, gore makes john wick PG 13, script for an action movie is definitely not worse than \"they killed my  dog\". 10/10 can watch again."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "An unashamed John Wick action clone, but without the world building to make the story compelling. It is also peppered with certain camera framings you can tell the director insisted on only to clumsily recreate their anime inspirations. It is also painfully clear which scenes were filmed in another country due to the unrealistic emphasis on neon signage. The bright spot was the above average acting of the Japanese cast, despite some accent issues."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "For a simple action film I thought it was brilliant, beautiful pictures, beautiful scenes, lots of neon lights, good actors and would even put it on a par with John Wick. But tastes are just different, I do not know what others expect from an action movie?"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Netflix action flicks are almost a staple on the streaming service, but Kate may have a cliched storyline, but it excels in two of its aspect: its setting in Japan and as a showcase for Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Having her hair cut short, you can see that she soo eerily resembling Sigourney Weaver, that many fans petitioned her to replace Weaver in the Aliens series or even to become her daughter.  Why not? She is a badass action star, and has been for most of her career, even starring in Die Hard as Bruce Willis' daughter! Anyhow, what else can I say about this flick and it shows Netflix dominance in these sort of films, genres that were once the pantheon for Direct to Video in your local Blockbuster."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Predictable story but John Wick level action from Mary E. I hope I see more clean action like this from her!Very impressed with all acting. Including all Japanese performers. Miku Patricia Martineau was the stand-out. Bratty and endering at the same time."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Solid and enjoyable. Appropriately badass. I don\u2019t want to assume anything, but I\u2019ve seen similar films with far worse acting, plot, and dialogue get way higher reviews -dare I say- because they have a virtually all male cast."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I typically start movies to abandon them ten minutes in if they suck, which is what I expected for this one.To my surprise, it was almost the movie I expected - but captivating from beginning to end.The photography is fabulous, the acting top notch throughout (seriously, casting should get a no holds barred party thrown for this accomplishment), it avoids all the cliches and sustains a thoughtful pace throughout.Surprise of the year. The only downside is that the story is told from beginning to end, there's not going to be a Kate 2."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "In such an over saturated genre there are few suprises here. The production quality is superb though and the fight choreography is very good. Ultimately the near comic book style failed to build up any real tension when the stakes get higher as things defend into the mindless action with the overpowered Kate b-lining her way through every obstacle. A fun watch if you're a fan of the action genre."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Another Netflix movie that exists for no other reason then to rob you of two hours of your life and keep you sitting in front of their platform so you're not doing something productive.Kate is a John Wick clone, its part Crank, part Ava, part Atomic Blond and could never have lived up to its aspirations (2 of those movies are just as bad as this). It brings nothing new to the table, you have seen all this before.Its watchable for about 30 minutes and then the story introduces one of the worst side-kicks of recent memory and its all downhill from there.The over-reliance on digital effects and gore added post-production makes it look like a video game, and a bad one at that.All this movie serves to do is add weight to the argument that streaming services are killing the \"art\" of cinema."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Barely watchable, another attempt from crapflix to actually have good movies, which actually amazes me cause they really have a couple of good movies (just a few) Please rate this down, they should actually take more effort on doing movies and not just come up with a horrible copie/merge of John Wick + Kill bill. I cannot recommend this movie at all."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "This is such an overused concept these days - and I literally watched 2 movies in a row with main actress being badass woman shooting her way throughout the movie. I mean the idea is not bad, just that there are so many movies in such style lately (and most of them have the woman's name in the title).

Seemed like a pretty, by the numbers techno thriller, but the fight scenes were excellent. Kudos to Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who seemed to have trained hard for this and it showed. Lot of kinetic energy and very colorful action made it visually appealing until that wore off, and I started paying attention to what was a pretty bland plot. I think they were going in the right direction, but about half to 3/4 into the movie, I felt myself reaching for my phone. By the end, I had no idea what was going on, and didn't really care. Wouldn't mind seeing Winstead in another action movie, though. She certainly showed her chops."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "This movie is competent for an action movie of the same category as John Wick and Atomic blonde. A tad bit more stylish than others but way to predictable in story. Mary does pull off the badass type but the plot doesn't do her favors."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "There is no doubt that how Quentin Tarantino influenced the modern film makers. There are a ton of films in the same formula as Kate. The Japanese hut combat scene reminds me of the famous action scene from Kill Bill, only this was pathetic. It should have been executed well. Even the speed of action, acting and coordination was so poor that it made the first impression wrong about the film. Villains revealing their identify keeping \"Ani\" in the room was the most stupidest plot reveal. Well, this twist is obvious from the beginning, almost all the films in this Genre had the same twist, it's kind of funny though.

Miku Patricia Martineau add charm to thwe scenes its a very dark movie but every scene she was in she stole the show.if i had to compare it's like atomic blonde meets Anna (2019) damn i wish it had a post credit scene or something i really wanted kate to survive or something i just wanted more."}], "recommendations": ["haywire", "gunpowder_milkshake", "atomic_blonde", "miami_vice", "the_mechanic", "hanna", "desperado", "wrath_of_man", "safe", "transporter_3", "gemini_man", "run_all_night", "underworld", "john_wick_chapter_3_parabellum", "mission_impossible_ii", "the_equalizer", "bloodshot", "mechanic_resurrection", "the_ice_road", "immortals", "brick_mansions", "nobody", "a_walk_among_the_tombstones", "angel_has_fallen", "the_equalizer_2"]}
