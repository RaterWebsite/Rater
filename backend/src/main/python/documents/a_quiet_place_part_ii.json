      "text": "If you liked the first one like me, you will like this movie. This sequel continues the themes, tone and character developments for the family with the addition of Cillian Murphy's character who is also exceptional in this. The movie has tension but not quite on the level of scenes from the first movie. This movie has emotional moments, also not as deep as the first movie. But these scenes of tension and emotion are included and they are done fairly well. By far, Millicent and Cillian are the stand outs in this film. They both carry the emotion of the movie and have the most tense scenes. Overall, just a solid film. And to think a sequel for a horror movie is good comes a long way in film history. Recommend fully."

      "text": "The original film was my first 5-star rating of 2018 (my review). The sequel, like is often the case, lacks the surprise of the original, while maintaining some of the suspense. It takes up after the first one with what\u2019s left of their family (Emily Blunt, Millicent Simmonds, Noah Jupe) travelling outside their safe area to survive. This leads them to new people and new adventures, while still eluding the extremely lethal, blind aliens. Most of the quick frights come early, then things settle down into more predictable encounters. There\u2019s still plenty of anxiety and the performances are effective, but the overall effect is not as riveting. Still, it\u2019s most involving on the big screen."

      "text": "Following a short epilogue taking us back to the origins of the alien species arrival on Earth, A Quiet Place Part II continues on directly from the original movie with the surviving members of the Abbott family having to leave the farm they\u2019ve called home for the last year.The first movie took an intriguing premise and delivered an effective, if slightly unevenly paced horror movie. This sequel certainly ups the pace, but in the process it tries to fit a little too much into an hour and a half with many ideas being underdeveloped leading to a rather abrupt ending. Despite these issues the formula still makes for a relatively entertaining watch with a number of very effective and tense scenes, and it seems to set things up for a third movie to end the trilogy."

      "text": "I'm not entirely sure why this movie needed to exist. It feels really tacked on and unnecessary. No decent storyline expansion (the 'prequel' is there just to bring in the C.Murphy's character?), no worthy new characters and same mechanics (we're walking slow and using ultrasound). Just a quick money grab there John?"

      "text": "This movie is every bit as fantastic as the first one.  It is fast paced and I love the way the director juxtaposed three of the main characters as they go through their own perils.  Brilliant!  Cillian Murphy is great as the friend who takes them in when the place the family has been staying in burns down.  Fast paced and some fine scary moments.  Great sequwl!"

      "text": "A Quiet Place Part II knows what it can explore, but it also has limitations that expose many of its weaknesses.From the outset, the narrative resource of the first film could not be explored in the same way again, because given that the characters finally have something with which they can defend themselves, the structure of the story changed.However the way in which Krasinski expands the story feels more like an expansion of a video game, rather than a more complete film, if you know what I mean.The tension and emotion still exist, and Krasinski manages to conduct them quite well, but he builds a climax that feels significantly forced, because he seems more interested in the comings and goings of the characters, so they can be in dangerous situations, instead of creating something more interesting or challenging.And unfortunately Krasinski ends the story suddenly again, but here feels a bit shameless because it's remarkably evident that this was made in order to prepare an inevitable third part.It seems that he got more excited about that, than about focusing on making this sequel more rewarding.I can't say I'm disappointed because I was entertained, but certainly this sequel was a watered-down experience compared to its predecessor."

      "text": "Doesn't work that well as an sequel, but It does the job. A Quiet Place Part II starts with a great 10 min flashback, then picks up where we left off. Part II doesn't overstay Its welcome, and I love when movie knows what we came for. Their are some problems with character's decision making, but It builds up the world and Monsters in tiny bits. Overall still juicy. There are people worth saving, but surviving comes first. If you liked A Quiet Place, You will enjoy Part II."

Recomendad\u00edsima."

      "text": "*shhhhhhhhh* This is a quiet place to enjoy a movie review. *Yelling* But that\u2019s not really our style here at Stream To Big Screen is it?! *Normal tone* Well, this week we were able to watch the long awaited A Quiet Place Part II. Let\u2019s just remind you of our movie review archive page and our review of Part I that occurred on Facebook. A Quiet Place: \u201c\u2026. Wait for tv/netflix\u2026 6.\u201d Simple and straight to the point. Let\u2019s see what Part II has for us.Just a reminder from A Quiet Place, this movie is about a family trying to survive in a world infested with aliens that find people through their extreme eardrums \u2013 I mean, their enhanced aural capabilities. Thus, the world has become a quiet place where any sound could get you killed. If you haven\u2019t seen the first part, I\u2019d recommend watching it before checking this flick out. Do you need to? I actually don\u2019t think so and, in fact, that\u2019s probably my biggest knock to Part II. Question\u2026 why didn\u2019t they just live by the waterfall again? Oh that makes too much sense? Nevermind and I digress.Let\u2019s fast forward to Part II where the movie starts with how it all began, which is something we didn\u2019t see in the first part. Then, we speed to where the first part left off and it\u2019s like why the heck didn\u2019t we just make the first part a little bit longer of a movie and combine to the two films. The first film lasted about 1 hour and 25 minutes. This movie ran for 1 hour and 28 minutes. WHY IN THE WORLD DID JOHN KRASINSKI NOT JUST COMBINE THESE TWO MOVIES?! Yes, the movie would\u2019ve be about 2 hours and 15 to 27 minutes with edits, but it would\u2019ve been one complete film. That just would have made more sense. Instead, it seems like these production companies went for the easy money grab and split the film into two. \u201cJim Halpert\u201d was like let me get my wife paid again for this role and I\u2019m not mad at it. After watching Part II, I couldn\u2019t help but say combining this with the first part just makes for a better and more complete movie. I feel Part II is too long for a short movie and that\u2019s no bueno. I\u2019m not even saying it\u2019s bad. It just drags on and could be wrapped up nice and tight like a formulaic \u201cLaw and Order: SVU\u201d episode. You know exactly how this movie is going to go from the trailer and that\u2019s the next disappointing part of the movie. Nothing unexpected occurs. Not a single thing. \u201cJim\u201d literally took the dystopian, zombie world, alien we-need-to-find-an-answer-to-fight-back playbook and put it in here. I knew I shouldn\u2019t have expected much from watching the first flick but finally being able to go back to theaters to watch movies has me hopeful. I shouldn\u2019t have been. Just like the first part, the movie was extremely quiet and anxiety filled. The commercial and trailer make the movie feel way more intense than it really is. As tense as this movie is, the lack of sound actually makes the film also very peaceful to watch. It\u2019s a strange combination for a \u201chorror/drama\u201d. Overall the cast as a whole does a solid job, but there really isn\u2019t much to do being quiet. I feel their pain, especially my guy Noah Jupe, as Marcus Abbott. It\u2019s just not enough.A Quiet Place Part II is just like the first one, a perfect streaming film. I\u2019m surprised this movie didn\u2019t premiere on Paramount+ because it would\u2019ve fit perfectly after streaming the first part right before \u2013 and they could get more subscribers. Part II is quiet and full of anxiety but drags on and should\u2019ve just been combined with the first film. Nothing of note really occurs in this movie to wow a viewer or make them flock to the theater. A Quiet Place Part II just like the first is a handful of popcorn, perfect for streaming. If you want to get out and support the movie theaters, like I do, or really enjoyed Part I, check this out in the matinee hours ONLY."

I found myself thinking through out the whole movie, use it, use it, use the secret weapon. The story is all wrong, they could have gone a different path liberating from town to town and explored the looters and evil survivors angle further. This could have been a great time to bring back the father too, to lead them. Also The hidden message in the radio transmission why hidden? So the aliens don't know what it is? Why don't just broadcast words? We weren't told the aliens understood the language, they seem very primitive and very basic and savage."

      "text": "This sequel picks up immediately after the events of the first film following an opening flashback sequence that reveals when the sound-sensitive aliens first arrived on Earth and wiped out most of humanity. Truth be told, I wasn't all that thrilled with the first film like most others seemed to be, mostly cause I felt as though the concept/idea was a clever one that could've been expanded upon so much better, not to mention the abrupt copout ending (although this is before we all knew a sequel would be made). So once this film was announced, I was skeptical but hopeful that they'd build upon the world and premise of the first film in an effective way, and while there's some interesting moments and truly tense scenes throughout, the ground treaded here still felt a little too pedestrian for my liking. There isn't a whole lot in the way of concept/story development, and I was hoping for a little bit more story/background behind why the aliens came to earth in the first place than what was shown in the film's opening flashback sequence. On the plus side however, the cast does an amazing job here, with John Krazinski once again taking directing and acting duties alongside real-life wife Emily Blunt, who gives another stellar performance just as she did in the first film. Their children (played by Noah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds) also once again stand out with their performances, and newcomer CIllian Murphy damn near steals the show with his excellent performance. And once again, my biggest gripe with these films is their abrupt cliffhanger endings, and that's the case here with this film unfortunately, but overall, the film is slightly more tense than the first, perfectly acted, but doesn't do much to build upon the premise/concept with the exception of a few clever moments. Fans of the first definitely won't be disappointed though"

So it seemed like this movie was going to have a mission. Like about them saving people, or trying to, but that never happened. Nothing close to it. Instead, things actually got worse. And you would think after the damage Regan and Emmett caused that they would go back to check on the \"paradise,\" but nope. It just ends after Regan \"becomes a hero.\"And sure, young kids are stupid and will explore places even when they know it might be dangerous, but the son going off on his own, leaving a baby, and walking around when there are freaking super deadly monsters around, was so damn dumb. No kid would be that stupid. And then after it was all done, \ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeffRegan never tells his mom what happened and she never asked about it.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff So damn dumb too.

What a completely immersive, beautiful, emotionally and sensationally overwhelming film. It is a perfect continuation from the first film and might even be better (it is definitely at least equal, which is an amazing accomplishment in itself). Certain characters from the first are definitely missed, but Cillian Murphy and Djimon Hounsou are wonderful additions. This is, however, completely Millicent Simmonds film and I can't tell you how amazing it is to see not only positive disability representation, but an empowered, multi-dimensional female lead. Krasinski wrote an incredible character and cast an incredible actor. He didn't cheapen her at all like most big studio scifi/horror movies do by saddling her with a love interest or making her either overly weak/helpless or irrationally suddenly a superhuman killing machine. The final scene is so moving and complete with her character development. I would welcome a Part III or other movie in this universe, but if it ended here, I would be just as happy. Bravo to Krasinski, who proves himself to be a brilliant writer/director (and much more than a paper salesman), the entire fantastic cast, picture and sound editors, and cinematographer. I hope there is some awards love at the end of the year for all of the above, especially Millie, Krasinski, and those who did the sound mixing/editing. And 1000% this is a great Cillian movie!"

I remember 15 months ago I was eagerly anticipating the release of the sequel to the highly successful horror movie A Quiet Place written and directed by John Krasinski. Initially it was difficult to see how a sequel would work without just being a repeat of what we\u2019ve seen before. I\u2019ve seen enough horror movies to know that not all franchises benefit from mindless sequels just for the sake of money. After a long 15 months of waiting, lockdowns and more lockdowns I\u2019m was finally able to sit in an actual cinema to see A Quiet Place Part II and I\u2019m delighted to say that it\u2019s a worthy sequel on par with its predecessor.A Quiet Place Part II begins with a flashback sequence and then picks up immediately after the events of the first film, the Abbott family (Emily Blunt, Millicent Simmonds & Noah Jupe) must now continue their fight for survival in a world of silence. Forced to leave their home they must now journey into the unknown with the threat of the creatures that hunt by sound. By now we know the importance of silence in this film and how it\u2019s used to build the tension. From the opening scene to the end credits you\u2019ll be holding your breath, unable to relax as the tension builds. Everything from the score and the use of sound is effective in making you jump out of your skin. The frights just keep on coming and will keep you on the edge of your seat. Make no mistake this is the type of movie that cinemas thrive on. A Quiet Place Part II develops the characters from the first movie and throws in none other than Cillian Murphy to the cast. He gives a terrific performance and was a great choice to join the rest of the cast. It\u2019s clear that A Quiet Place I & II are in the hands of someone who understands what makes a good horror movie. Great characters with a story so intense you\u2019ll barely be able to breathe. The tension builds and builds to a third act that thankfully doesn\u2019t fall apart. I did not expect the sequel to be this good and it\u2019s looking very likely that a third movie is in the works and if there\u2019s a good story and John Krasinski is directing then I\u2019m totally onboard for A Quiet Place trilogy.There\u2019s really nothing like the feeling of watching a film in a cinema. It\u2019s an experience I\u2019ve greatly missed and online streaming sites can only do so much. Certain movies are just meant to be seen on the silver screen and A Quiet Place II is definitely one of them. Home viewing just wouldn\u2019t be the same. So horror fans it\u2019s time to get back to it if you haven\u2019t already, enjoy the magic of cinema with a truly brilliant horror/thriller. Highly recommended."

      "text": "Once again, John Krasinski shows audiences the power of silence to create palpable tension. Additionally, Krasinski's way of highlighting key items and dialogue that become significant later on in the film are clear signs that story elements shall not go to waste with him as the director. Without the audience knowing it, certain objects in the environment introduce some traits of Cillian Murphy's character before the family realizes who he is. There are many times throughout A Quiet Place Part II that the immediate motive of a character is unknown, and the only way of finding out is to keep watching. The classic storytelling guideline: \"Show, don't tell\" comes to mind here a lot. However, it reasonable to argue that a few too many questions went unanswered. For example: in the process of running and hiding, why doesn't all that noise attract more attention from others? That aspect seems inconsistent with the sound sensitivity in Part I. Then, at the ending, only the immediate problems had been solved, but the credits roll before the emotional payoff. This series leaves you, again, with your own imagination of what happens next."

If you liked Part 1, then you will like Part 2. With that said, the worst part is the ending since it is basically Part 1 but on a bigger level."
