The first 15 minutes were intruging enough but then it becomes slow & boring with a sudden jump scare everyone saw coming (any horror buff worth his/her salt, knows what's coming when a character sticks their head out of a moving car window). Then again it slows down to a snails pace with the most bizarre rushed laughable cliched ending I haven't seen since the 60's.  I expected a lot more especially with the calibre of the actors in the movie and seriously we could've done without the granny/grandad nudity, won't be able to unsee that! The movie reminded me of the highly rated Rosmary's Baby plot, but that's where the similarities end.  Very, Very, Very disappointing."

      "text": "This movie was less of the slow burn suspense thriller-horror that is was advertised as and more or a meandering waste of time just waiting for a MST3K episode. About a quarter of the theater left before the movie ended and everyone else at the end just before the credits rolled. I waited through some of the credits as I was sure I had been Shyamalan'd againThe story was lackluster with no characters being likable and only two being very sympathetic. Half of the movie I found myself hoping something awful would happen to most of the main cast just to get rid of them and move the plot along to something more interesting. There are several major plot holes and multiple instances of \"horror movie logic\". Several things that feel like they will be major plot points early in the film have no real relevance and are only there to set a creepy stage for the rest of the film. A few of the cast members have acting talent shine through during rare moments of this film but with the terrible writing it could not save this one.The music and sound effects in this movie are frequently done hamfistedly. The music will go from low suspenseful rumble, to climactic Jaws is about to appear, to overbearing, to questioning if this will cause long term hearing damage; all with little regard to what is happening on screen. The special effects are all over the place with some being done well and others missing the mark completely. One of the stand outs is a point late in the film that should look like an apparition crawling quickly along the wall and instead looks like a panicked bug in a bed sheet being drug through the background on a wire. When this is part of the final climactic build up for your slow burn horror thriller and several members of the audience can't help but audibly laugh you have failed somewhere along the way.The single redeeming part of this movie is the cinematography. This film has some amazing sweeps and pans that help to guide your focus through whatever the poor writing wants you to feel is important. It has wonderful use of depth of field. There are some beautiful and technically demanding shots including the opening longshot. This is not enough to suggest this movie in its entirety and but may mean shots from this could be used to study cinematography.In the end I can not comprehend the hype on this one. I spent more than an hour after seeing this movie thinking and talking with the person that saw the movie with me. We desperately tried to find some less evident metaphor or greater meaning. Despite our best efforts this is just a poor horror movie with an amazing marketing team."

      "text": "Hereditary comes briskly walking out the doors holding promise that we might get a good look into the different ways that people deal with grieving and a possible look at the effects that paranoid schizophrenia can have on those that suffer from it... and then the writer got drunk and accidentally wrote another script in the same file. See... I would be praising this film if I got what I'd been promised from the first act, but the film quickly devolves into becoming just another dumb horror film that lacks in any form of depth from the second act on. The only reason I gave this film a 3/10 was because the first act was good and most other aspects of the film were passable. But the more I think about this film, the more I seem to dislike it. Most other bad films in the supernatural horror genre are at least fun to watch, but there were so many moments that I wanted to walk out of Hereditary. Even if I hadn't gone to see it with somebody else, I still would have refused to leave because I held on to that hope that they might just save the film by bringing it back to what the first act had promised, which is something they never did. If you want to walk out of this film at any point, do it, the film doesn't get better, it only gets worse. If you want to watch this film, I'd wait until it's on one of the major streaming services because it's not at all worth the money it would cost to go to the theater."

      "text": "There are a couple of veteran actors in this film. Their performance is not sub-par. At first glance, the story seems to be inexorably intriguing. Occasionally, a movie is created, and there is a stark absence of any redeeming qualities. \"Hereditary\" falls into this category. Some classic horror films contain some sort of message of hope or light, but not so with this one. It is a hostile, harrowing, disturbing black hole. I still feel ambivalent about even posting this review. There is trepidation that this may actually encourage someone to go out and see the film. I would urge you not to see it at all, because it is relentlessly dark. It is very emotionally draining to watch. There is no excitement. There is no hope in it. There is only blackness. In particular, if you are a believer, don't waste your time on this film. The pervasive feeling of evil crawls into your skin and refuses to leave. Hollywood has decent material that comes out of it from time to time, but \"Hereditary\" is purely and strictly obscene. If you have kids, it is not appropriate at all. Take your family to see \"Ferdinand\" instead. I am not condemning horror films in general. These observations apply specifically to \"Hereditary.\" Don't watch it."

I love Toni Collette but she had nothing to work with in this cack-handed mishmash of awfulness that reaches for the elegance of Babadook but collapses into a heap of gibberish. Collette's mom character has to fake anguish and depression (i.e. to herself) but she didn't quite manage to pull it off and just seemed fake, like she was putting in a \"for scale\" performance. The only redeeming factor was Milly Shapiro. Her performance was captivating and the film could have done with a lot more of her in it.The most disturbing thing about Hereditary is that so many people find it disturbing. I shall choose to see it as an allegory for the rise of Donald Trump, which is the only way it makes sense."

If you get a chance, miss it or rent it down the road. There were a few shocking scenes, but other than that I was watching a plane crash in slow motion. You know its going to, just not sure whos going to survive it. Thats the main reason I didn't walk out.Two positive things I can say are the acting is good and the cinematography was done well too.

      "text": "This is probably an unpopular opinion, but I honestly don't care: A24 doesn't know how to do horror! Most people seem to think 'The Witch' is absolutely terrifying and amazing whereas I not only found it to be one of THE WORST movies I've ever seen, but also zero percent scary and not even remotely creepy, and I also thought it was the worst unintentional comedy I'd ever seen since 2006s 'The Wicker Man' with Nic Cage! The year after, with 'It Comes at Night', I personally thought that had a much creepier atmosphere and more intriguing premise and was slightly better overall, but the final product left much to be desired. Well, with this latest (and waaayyy too overhyped) addition to A24's filmography, they've once again proven to me that they don't really know a good or truly scary horror movie when they see one, at least in my opinion they don't. Much like 'The Witch' and 'It Comes at Night', it was such a slow burn with little or no horror until the very end, and none of these films have any moments of horror whatsoever if you ask me. Furthermore, it certainly didn't help that not only did this remind me an awful lot of 'The Witch', but it had so many predictable moments and tropes that we've seen time and again in so many previous horror films. Silly-looking naked old people (yep 'The Witch' and 'It Follows' had that too), creepy smiling dead people (the Insidious films did this much better), possessed people climbing walls and hiding in ceiling corners (sounds like just about every possession movie out there), possessed people banging their heads on desks, walls, etc. (seen that a million times), a dog getting killed (A24's infamous for that at this point), a possessed person joining a ridiculous-looking witch-like coven or cult at the very end of the film after most or all of their family's been slaughtered (you guessed it, 'The Witch' did it too!) Overall, the only positive it had going for it was Toni Colette's fierce performance. Everyone else was pretty underwhelming to be honest. And like I said before, this movie just isn't scary and there's literally nothing new to see here that hasn't been done before, whether better or worse. And on one final note: A24, no more horror films please!!! You're just not good at it! I don't care what anyone else says!"

I honestly didn't care for any of them. This movie lived up to the hype. I can't really explain why it's so horrifying, but it just feels so... wrong. The way the film captures absolute grief and despair made my emotions churn, and there are some moments in the final 20 minutes of the film that were absolutely horrifying. Of course, this film is nothing without Toni Collette, who gives a performance worthy of an Academy Award. She walks a very fine line between portraying an emotionally traumatized, psychologically damaged woman and not hamming it up to the point where it's funny. I'm actually not kidding, I think it's one of the best performances from an actress that I have ever seen. Alex Wolff also gives an absolutely wonderful performance. The movie is a slow burn, but it's never boring. It's never pretentious either, which I felt was the case with 'The Witch' and 'It Comes at Night'. I honestly think that it is equal to the Exorcist in its horrific imagery. It's really one of the best horror films I've seen in a very long time, and I highly recommend it."

Hereditary focuses on a family who loses their estranged matriarch, which leads to the grieving family experiencing strange occurrences and haunting scenarios which can only be explained by unravelling the mysterious dark history of their lost loved one. Sound original? Not really, nothing too special here.The plot is interesting at some points, and it is interesting to see how they were able to weave it all together in the final third, but the outlying problem is that it took way too long to get there. There were way too many irrelevant scenes that contributed little to nothing to the plot as a whole, and this caused the movie to drag on through the first two acts. I found myself itching to grab my phone and browse other movies I could watch multiple times because I was absolutely bored out of my mind. I can also barely classify this as a horror film until the last 10-15 minutes of the film when things start to actually pull together and the whole purpose of the movie is finally revealed. Unfortunately, to me, it was not worth the long wait, it started to become obvious and somewhat contrived going into the final act. I never got the feeling of being genuinely terrified or worried for any of the characters because the danger was never really present, on top of this the atmosphere was not really well built, which is absolutely imperative for a horror/thriller to impress. The soundtrack was acceptable, but nothing amazing to build immersion, kind of reminded me of The Shining a bit.Toni Collette did an a pretty good job of portraying her character, she was the most convincing actor in the entire film. Gabriel Byrne, on the other hand, was incredibly disappointing, somewhat because he wasn't involved all that much and his character was bland and underdeveloped... every other character was either acceptable or just \"there\" as they did not contribute much.This film could have been about an hour and twenty minutes and might have been a lot better if they were able to delve into the grandmother's mysterious past a lot sooner because those were the only parts that were able to keep my attention. Trying to put the pieces together before the movie does is most of the fun in a mystery film, when it keeps you guessing, you become entertained, but there was way too much subplot that was getting in the way and destroying the pace of the film. It ruined the entire experience for me.+ Toni Collette's acting+ Matriarch's mystery is intriguing, at first+ Final third is decent- Absolutely abysmal pacing- Not a horror film in my opinion- Way too much subplot- Unnecessary character development- Poor writing and plot climax- \"Disturbing scenes\" are lacklustre- All other actors are subpar, at best- Massively overrated, for what reason?Overall, this movie could have had something interesting on its hands, the initial premise was great, and the story setup from the beginning was good, but the awful pacing, subpar horror/mystery/thriller elements, lack of creepy atmosphere, wasted time, and forced unoriginal ending, make this movie a failure in the eyes of the horror genre. Unfortunately, again, I must mention that critics are really getting it wrong in the entertainment industry right now, 87 is way too high, the only reason I can think of them giving off this rating is simply because they have not seen many horror movies before to notice all unoriginal elements that are present in this film. This movie is a 25 for me."

It had a ridiculously rushed laughable ending that left me scratching my head.  Not a movie I'll want to watch again anytime soon and I'm dumbfounded this movie has such a high score."

The ending is so bad I had to go throw up the popcorn I finished 5 minutes into this pile of f*ckWho ever gave this pile of sh*t over 1 should definitely go see a doctor and get their selves aborted, we don't need people like you in this planet."

It should be no surprise that many pretentious critics would put this as one of their favorite movies of the year. if you're looking to be creeped out for no good damn reason this is the film for you.

      "text": "For all the hype this movie received pre-release, it failed to deliver upon so completely that I left the theater almost angry at the fact that I had been so incredibly duped. Hereditary is a slow, plodding, and ultimately boring affair that I couldn't wait to leave behind me. My biggest issue with Hereditary is that it breaks absolutely zero new ground. This movie has been made any number of ways; add to that it hones in only on those who have a fear of spiritual/religious matters. While there are many religious folks left out there to scare with ominous music and a few \"shock\" scenes, the rest of the horror community is totally left out of the gag. Another matter is character development. While aptly acted, I simply didn't care what happened to a single one of these people. They were 2 dimensional as if specifically designed to be horror movie characters. Gabriel Byrne could have been cut from the movie and I'm pretty certain no one would've noticed. Let's hope this is not a trendsetter for the latest wave of horror or we're in for a predictable, dull ride."

I hate jump scares, but even the worst jump scare movies have something happen. Nothing happens in this movie. It was so boring that I was thinking of sleeping or walking out. In our cinema the only reaction to the movie was laughter at how terrible it was. Worst movie I've have ever seen in a cinema. Wish I could get my money and time back."
