Bad plot, a slightly funny joke every so often and easily forgotten after 5 minutes.I understand that the movie is only meant to be funny and that it's not meant to be amazing or something that anyone would recommend, but this movie fails at a comedy just like the parody movies that fail such as Meet The Spartans and Scary Movie. Both hated by anyone who knows anything about movies.Listen to the critics, they get paid for a reason."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Homage or parody? That is the question. Although the filmmaker gives out directions on how to watch \"Cop Out\", as Paul(Tracy Morgan) pays homage to other films by re-enacting them to a suspect under interrogation, the moviegoer should ignore the authorial voice emanating from Morgan's character, because \"Cop Out\" is a parody, since some of the apparently serious scenes are funnier than the intended comedic ones. On occasion, the silly banter between Morgan and Bruce Willis(even sillier when Sean William Scott joins the party) can be moderately amusing, but it's the dramatic moments, like the one in which a Mexican drug dealer begs forgiveness from God in a church after his younger brother caps a flunkey, that \"Cop Out\" becomes \"Buddy Cop Movie\", a parody made all the more canny for its straight-faced execution of a cheesy eighties cop show like \"Miami Vice\". This filmmaker, known for his impolite dialogue in such anarchic films such as \"Clerks\" and \"Dogma\", has to be kidding, right? As Jimmy, Willis keeps it \"real\"(or is it real?) while he wistfully discusses his daughter's upcoming wedding to a drug kingpin's mistress, a scene that seemingly sends-up the moment where the tough guy reveals his unbeknownst softer side, in this case, via soliloquy. (The Hispanic woman can't understand English, so it's like he's alone). At the actual wedding, however, the emotionally climaxing moment where Jimmy gives his daughter away seems too sincere and persuasive in its adherence toward Hollywood conventionality, the moviegoer fears that the filmmaker might actually mean it. If the sentimental ending is homage, and not a parody of bad television and movies, then \"Cop Out\" doesn't seem like a laughing matter anymore."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "With Bruce Willis and Tracey Morgan i thought this was a good match and it would be funny.

Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan star in this dreaded action/comedy picture. Now what I liked about Smith's earlier films was that it continued to be funny through out the whole film and it new exactly what it wanted to be. However that's certainly not the case with \"Cop Out\". For every mediocre joke in \"Cop Out\" there is about twenty minutes of brutal fighting that doesn't move the plot along at all. I recommend watching the first five minutes, it's about the only remotely comedic part in \"Cop Out\". This is a big disappointment for me and I hope Smith's up and coming films are alot better then this"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Every one...do not listen to the freaking critics. The opening freaking scene tells you it is a parody on other cop movies, in fact it pays homage too them!. (that may be too big of a word for the critics.

By the way, the only reason anybody would be a movie critic is because they couldnt get a freaking job handing carts out @...lets just say it sounds like Marmart. Oh yeah one more thing, Ebert (or whatever his/her name is) said, \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid was a terrible movie. Obviously, he has rescinded that review!

Not just chronologically, but also inspirationally.  Fletch is one of my favorite comedies.  As is Stakeout.  As is Lethal Weapon.  All elements clearly and intentionally paid homage (as Tracy Morgan humorously mispronounces at the beginning of the movie).  It was Kevin's not-so-subtle message (along with the cheap synthesizer and Fletch song at the ending fade) that he was about to show a film that had not one ounce of originality, but was meant to be an enjoyable popcorn film for fans of his, fans like him and those who just wanted to be entertained.  I had NO expectations coming into this movie as critics and viewers alike ripped it apart.  From a critical perspective, it's only slightly above average.  However, from the INTENT of the film, it was perfect.  The movie was fun, enjoyable and made me happy to see the genre revisited.  Thanks Kevin!"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "one of the funniest movies of 2010 the plot was dump but what do you expect from kevin smith. the movie made me laugh through whole time and so did the rest of the theater  i was in but i can see why many people didnt like it, its one of those movie either people like or dont."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "It provides the laughs, but there are tons of better comedies and movies out there. It's funny at times and hilarious at others, it starts off poorly but quickly had me laughing. Surprisingly though the funny moments come strictly from Bruce Willis and the supporting cast, Tracy Morgan almost never made me laugh, the only times he did was when he was on screen with Seann William Scott, when Seann isn't on screen Tracy Morgan just ends up being an annoying character who you would rather see played by someone else.

There is no chemistry between Willis & Morgan, the jokes are bland, the action is pretty standard and sidekicks like Scott can't save it.
