Given the 10s, the shills are out but nothing can cover-up how bad this is.  Hell, they had to keep Gal showing a lot of skin during the entire movie to keep any interest and distract attention from things like the lasso dissapearing from both her hands and suddenly being coiled on her him in 1/10th of a second, or being normally dressed to being in WW costume in same amount of time (after she hops out of the car mid movie).  This is a parody, not a real movie."

It's the perfect combination of \"fall asleep\" boredom, \"laugh out loud\" stupidity, and \"check your phone as a distraction\" cringe.   As for the action? I can't decide if it compares better to Superman 3 or Superman 4, but its right at those levels of hilarious cartoonish-ness.  After the first 30 minutes, you will be checking the timer over and over to see how much of the movie is left, and by the time the never-ending climax rolls around you'll be begging for someone to put you out of your misery.  I gave it 2 points for Gal Gadot's occasional smile into the camera, otherwise AVOID AT ALL COSTS."

I think maybe Warner Brothers knew this was going to be a VOD/straight to home release and cheaped out on finishing a quality edit. The first 10 minutes of the movie feel like a film of higher caliber, then it degrades to a made-for-TV movie complete with some Hallmark-channel fake snow."

Things and rules are established though we both know that magic shouldn't exist in this DC universe from the other movies, but still there are rules.  However, the movie will break its own rules for the sake of progressing the movie, and since we all know everything will be fine since we have Justice League and Batman v Superman in a later timeline, the stakes in 84 don't matter.  The movie is to long and to conveluted to make you care since the outcome is already known.  Sadly as I like all the other DC movies up to this point, this will not be a rewatch and we'll just pretend this never happened."

      "text": "I had anticipated this movie's release and looked forward to the second installment of Wonder Woman after enjoying the first film. I was sadly very disappointed to see that Warner Brothers and DC still haven't gotten the message and continue to squander beloved characters, great casts on poorly executed and poorly written scripts and storylines. Only redeeming qualities are some well choreographed fight scenes that felt reminiscent of the first film and some of the art direction for Cheetah and Wonder Woman key scenes. Gal Gadot is still the picture esque modern Wonder Woman with a heart of gold. Everything else feels poorly pieced together and leaves you confused and left wanting something better. Some moments were almost satirical and I found myself laughing at moments that were designed to create tension (children in a road). Pedro Pascal does well working with a character whose motivations and powers grow faster than character development. Warner Brothers continues their tradition of mediocre superhero movies in a post Avengers world. That said if you are a fan of the superhero genre and already have a HBO Max account watch it with lowered expectations."

Feels like the entire point was to find a way to bring Chris Pine back, which IMHO, was not necessary at all and it shows. He does nothing besides crack some \"dude outta time\" jokes, which obviously have been done before and were corny the first hundred times.. There is cringe everywhere. The mall scene feels like a glorified Pepsi commercial. Character motivations make no sense and yet at the same time everything is extremely predictable. The action is fine, and even the acting is ok, but the story is outright terrible. Maybe it's due to the lack of big movie releases in 2020 that so many critics are enjoying this film... That's understandable. As a pure get-away mindless fun time, then this movie passes the test. If you were hoping for anything grander, then you may be disappointed. This movie is not very good and will be forgotten in time. However, since this year has been crap, if you can find enjoyment in it then I envy you."

If this wish stone made other people's wishes come true, and created giant walls and made other things materialize, then why didn't they just bring Steve back in his own body? Why did he have to take over this random man's life, who basically has no say in the matter? I'll bet you if the roles were reversed, and Batman or Superman wished for a dead lover to come back, and it possessed some random woman's body, and they had a scene with them waking up together in bed, that there would have been an uproar, because isn't that considered rape? Having sex with someone who's drunk or drugged, and not in control of their body or able to give consent, isn't that considered rape? And in the remainder of the movie this man, who is possessed by the spirit of Steve Trevor, is put into various perilous situations and even shot at and I don't think that's cool. Plus, I thought you only get one wish, so why did Barbara get two wishes? Her first wish to become like Diana, then the second wish to become an apex predator/Cheetah? That completely contradicts what we were told in the beginning of the movie. And why are all the men portrayed as catcalling jerks (i.e., except for Steve Trevor)? And why is there a little boy just roaming around unattended in various offices and facilities, and in the one of the last scene's he's stranded and walking alone on a stretch of highway, and at the end comes running out of the woods by himself? Where's his mother or guardian? Also, how does a man (Steve Trevor) who only flew planes in the 1940's able to fly a military jet that has 1980's technology? I think there are too many plot holes and things that make no sense, and that are just wrong and cringeworthy, especially the fact that a superhero has sex with a non-consenting possessed man. That's just wrong on so many levels and this movie is just wrong on so many levels."
