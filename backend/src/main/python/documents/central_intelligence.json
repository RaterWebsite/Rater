The material is not inspired, but if you think this is the sort of movie you'd like, you'll probably end up having a great time with it."

Most of the movie people were giggling at serious scenes because everyone came in with the mindset that its supposed to be a comedy. Kevin Hart is overly serious all the time and Dwayne is forcefully goofy. The chemistry works at times but the plot doesn't. Its like a really bad buddy cop movie where you have no clue who is the good cop and who is the bad cop. Just wait for it come out on Netflix or downloads, not worth a theater visit."

      "text": "Another Comedy Does Not Fulfill What Promises\r Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart join forces in a predictable comedy and not as extraordinary as its grosses at the box office.\r \"Central Intelligence\" is a classic buddy cop film (CIA agents and everything else) starring two of the personalities most influential and striking of North America, Johnson and Hart -  MTV Awards 2016 was presented by them and will be together in the remake of \"Jumanji\" next year - must save the world of a corrupt cartel that threatens the global economy. It doesn't seem a very original plot, nevertheless, it is the impact of its protagonists that makes spectators buy one ticket to see it. I did it and discovered the truth.\r Directed and partly written by Rawson Marshall Thurber, the story saturates a cliche argument with predictable and ridiculous plot twists, but which undeniably is fun. Chemistry of the pair is not brilliant nor funny like Poehler and Fey, nevertheless, they successfully establish their connection and dazzle talent and joy. Well made jokes and a few unexpected cameos molded the surprises of the film, but it is not enough to hide the doubtful development. Accept it, Hart and \"The Rock\" do not have enough material to keep a comedy that abuses its duration (1 hour and 47 minutes), that only manages McCarthy, maybe, it would have been better a lenght lighter and shorter.\r 20 years ago, Calvin Joyner (Hart) -nicknamed \"The Golden Jet\" - was the star student and champion of guys, therefore, he is commemorated by the sycophant director in front of school, such attention is diverted by an atrocious action, an psychological aggression on the personality of Bob (Johnson), overweight boy is victim of school bullying and he is thrown naked in front of hundreds of teenagers; that's where Calvin gives him his jacket so that covers up himself, the guy comes out as grateful as sadden by the event, the first encounter of a disorting friendship. Currently, the boy with the future more promising, works as an accountant, has a humble house and lives with his wife Maggie (Danielle Nicolet). The guys at school have organized a meeting for all students of that period, which do not like Calvin on account of his drastic change of life and his abrupt change of thought. Social networks are a viable link to meet people, Calvin knows it and decides to accept an invitation from Facebook, having a night of drinks with his renewed friend from high school. Starting from there, it unfolds the meet of their lives, what do you do, where do you live, with whom; Stone manages to stay in the house of his friend, he realizing that it CIA would come to the following day claiming that his friend of the last night is a dangerous criminal.\r Thurber carried out an acceptable work, a comedy that we've already seen before full of unnecessary twists and a few funny jokes starring  by the real stars, \"The Rock\" a brawny with much, much talent and Hart a little guy with much, much inventiveness. It was not a disappointment, but the pieces did not fit together in the filmic puzzle."

      "text": "Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart team up to solve a confusing case of national security. Johnson's character was bullied in high school, where Hart's was a star. 20 years later, the tables have turned and Johnson is a pumped CIA agent, while Hart is an accountant. Johnson creates a sweet character, as he continues to develop his considerable comic skills. Hart does more panic reacting than launching the jokes, but his manic style is usually entertaining. There are a few quick action scenes, but most of the time is spent with the starts interacting. The movie moves with an energetic pace and the duo has enjoyable chemistry. On the other hand, much of the dialogue isn't very witty (and re-hashes the same themes) and there aren't enuff really funny bits. It's amusing, but doesn't live up to the comic potential."

Kevin Hart provides his standard motor-mouthed brand of humor even in the straight man role.\r So the results here aren't exactly going to blow you away. That being said, there are still plenty of laughs here. It's just that some land with a dud. Johnson's character can be a little too over-the-top at times. No fault of the actor, it's the material he's given. His ability to go all out with it is appreciated. There are also some really great and hilarious cameos.\r The plot is very familiar in a lot of ways. The movie tries a little too hard to keep you guessing whether or not Johnson's \"Bob\" is really a good guy or actually the villain. It does succeed at making you think twice on more than one occasion. That's partially due to how oddly the plot is handled. It's ultimately not a big deal, but a touch irritating nonetheless. On the upside it leads to some funny gags and an interesting message about bullying.\r There is also a slightly cheap feel to this. The action is a touch awkward to watch and the visuals of the world have a very studio set feel to them. You can tell the money went towards the talent.\r There are plenty of laughs to be found here. Maybe it won't keep you rolling on the floor, but it does introduce us to a great new comedy duo. I can't wait to see more of Johnson and Hart onscreen together. They are a blast. They also manage to elevate the movie above it's flaws and make more laughs come from the material than anybody else could have. I consider that a success."

Kevin Hart delivers a great performance and had us all laughing. However, The Rock could've been a bit better. He seemed to act like he did in all of his other films, pulling off a bit of a \"macho man\" which doesn't really fit this film.\r While there were funny moments, this movie was EXTREMELY cheesy, with predictable actions such as Hart's character turning Johnson's in but then coming in to save him after realizing what he shouldn't have turned him in-because friends, even if you don't know each other much, stick together, right? The implement of \"feel-good\" moments just sorta made the movie not as fun as it would've been had there been more tension and more of what the audience wanted. Plus, at the end when The Rock took his clothes off was way too corny. This movie is the personification of a stereotypical Hollywood feel-good comedy."

This was probably one of the more funny movies I have watched in a while. The chemistry between Kevin Hart, and his typical humor and Dwayne Johnson' more buddy buddy, strange, someone has dropped him as a baby humor is hilarious. There are plenty of laughs in this movie, and for the most part the humor is pretty clean overall. Yes there are cursing, but not all that much.\r Some things I didn't like about the movie was I felt the plot was a bit too far fetched, I mean come on. At the end they just go on hunky dory and let Kev and Bob go to the reunion even though Kev shot at one of them (by accident) and Bob basically almost killed everyone.\r Overall, you aren't coming into this movie to watch the plot be crystal perfect, instead you are coming for comedy. This movie does that extremely well."

The hilarious but not nonsense actions, sweet high-school buddies friendships, comedy about bullies and inspiration to transform a better oneself however are all blended well into this lack-of-originality thriller; though insufficient to generate big humors, it is still able to keep your smile till the end. The film centralises on the delightful chemistry between the two actors, both Hart and Johnson deliver a cheerful bromantic, especially the latter who takes his character and silliness seriously other than just knowing to flex muscles.

His imitation of Eddie Murphy fell flat. I recall snickering (briefly) four times during the movie, and rolling my eyes at the over-used \"death\" scenario of the former partner. Truly a movie that one can see--not recommended--and then going to see something that will take the horrible taste out of memory."

      "text": "Central Intelligence is probably the best comedy movie of the year so far that I have seen. Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson take this PG-13 action comedy way over the top and made me laughing so hard that my stomach started hurting. The action sequences were great and just the film itself is so humorous. Central Intelligence also had many surprising and hilarious cameos (no spoilers) and I thought that was very clever. Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson formed an outstanding team and this film actually reminded me of The Heat. This buddy cop comedy was like a male version of The Heat and it also has a strong message. The trailer doesn't give out what I think are the best scenes, which I am so grateful for. The length of the film was just perfect and I thought the plot was very well constructed. This is like the one movie that Kevin Hart doesn't get too over-the-top annoying, which I loved. If you need a good laugh to make your day better, definitely go check out Central Intelligence as I think this is way better than both Ride Alongs. (100/100)"

The Rock and Hart are an excellent combination. There are a lot of laughs to be had here.  A part of me wishes for an unrated version which I know would be even funnier but its pretty funny for a PG-13 movie.  Its nice to see a change of pace here. Kevin Hart is playing the \"serious\" role while the Rock is playing the funny \"wierd\" character. The movie also has a great message to it when it comes to bullying.  Its a fun movie. Go see it if you are a fan of either one or both."

      "text": "Central Intelligence visits the world of Calvin Joyner (Kevin Hart)- the most-popular-guy-in-school turned accountant who is struggling to cope with the regrets he adopted since high school, especially since his reunion is coming up. But all that changes when he reunites with Bob Stone (Dwayne Johnson), a bullied boy he helped once during high school and who still admires Calvin. By no choice of his own, Calvin is thrown into a world of espionage and danger to help Bob save the world and stop the bad guys, all while being hunted by the CIA. But is Bob really the good guy? Hilarity ensues as friendships are tested, people are put in danger, and Calvin has the most exhilarating experience of his life as the world learns what happens when you bully someone...\r Alright, raise your hand if you DON'T want to see a comedy movie starring Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson. Yeah, I didn't think so. After seeing the trailer, I couldn't wait for this movie! What a pairing! And they, of course, performed to standard with fantastic chemistry between them! Their main source of comedy was Hart's character explicitly expressing several dozen times during the movie that he does NOT want to be a part of Johnson's character's secret mission, with Johnson's character just ignoring him and getting him involved anyway. I probably don't do it justice, but they are a great comedy duo.  For some, the humour will fall below par, but that's a personal preference. That's definitely the best part of the movie. You probably see most of the highlights in the trailers if you watched them, but there is still some new humour to be found. But don't be fooled, this is also a spy/mystery movie.\r The audience, like Hart's character, is unsure of how much trust should be placed in Johnson's character. Is he CIA? Is he bad? Why is he wanted? And without any spoilers, evidence for both sides pop up which makes Bob Stone an enigma! This was an element that I really enjoyed. This movie had its downfalls in its plot conveniences and use of cliches. Sure, the actual storyline is original, but the formatting and style with which its executed has been done to death. And do you really expect us to believe that a small black man completely overwhelmed by the situation he is in can fight trained gunmen and handle firearms himself with his only experience being from limited observation? No. And Dwayne Johnson is a big target, he cannot dodge every bullet.\r The cast includes Kevin Hart, Dwayne Johnson, Amy Ryan, Danielle Nicolet, Jason Bateman, Aaron Paul, Ryan Hansen, and Tim Griffin. Some impressive comedic stars here, but make no mistake, its the Hart-Johnson duo that's front and centre here, and as I've already said, their relationship is great! The other characters are barely more than extras and they weren't at all memorable. The themes include friendship, karma, revenge, trauma, and sacrifice among others. The special effects could be mediocre at times, but I was kept engaged through the balanced blend of comedy, action, adventure, and the intriguing characters. The atmosphere fluctuated along with Johnson's character's tone- serious to weirdly excited and cavalier. I'm not sure how much I liked this, but it only widened the demographics of this movie so that more people can enjoy it.\r Director Marshall Thurber has had plenty of experience with Comedy films- through the likes of Dodgeball and We're the Millers, he delivers up to standard. You can trust this guy's credibility. To improve however, he could've strayed from the cliches and poor plot conveniences, and maybe varied the humour a little more. Did I mention this whole storyline was finished within a day?\r To conclude, this movie did well as a buddy cop movie. It definitely isn't the best movie I've ever seen, but the combination of humour and action will engage. It's another guilty pleasure movie and so the rewatchability level is HIGH.\r Rating: 6.5/10\r *Stick around during the credits for a look at the Blooper Reel*"

      "text": "Central Intelligence is intended to be a comedic action/spy film starring two of Hollywood's greatest male stars Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart and directed by the mastermind behind We're the Millers...oh wait.\rActually, this movie wasn't that great to begin with. Except for the bloopers at the end, which are actually hilarious, I wasn't laughing while watching this movie. It's enjoyable enough because like many Hollywood blockbusters, it was made to be a movie that largely relied on entertainment value. However, entertainment value does not equal a great movie, the equation Hollywood forgets when it does the math.\rThe characters are standard action heroes that try hammering in an anti-bullying message that is noble, but feels so forced in the movie's narrative that desperately tries to be significant at the last minute. This movie should have been like Kingsman (2015) in the sense that it is self aware. The plot is very clich\u00e9 and predictable as well. For me, it just doesn't warrant a second viewing and it wasn't very humorous. My disappointment with this movie will be commemorated with a seal of expendability."

Let's be honest he is best in his serious state, not when he needs to act like a child. That's what the movie feels like, childish jokes that aren't even funny to kids. I actually found the plot to be solid for a comedy movie, but it doesn't get excecuted that well.Just ok enough to watch all the way through but still a very meh movie and maby the worst movie i saw dwayne johnson in."
