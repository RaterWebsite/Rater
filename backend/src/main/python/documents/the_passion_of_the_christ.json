      "text": "The Passion of the Christ shows in an incredible realistic way the last hours of Jesus Christ, whitout a doubt one of the most important event in the history of mankind. Though there are a lot of movies about this event and about the life of Christ this is by far the most authentic, powerful and honest one. This movie has something that the others are missing. It was made with the intent to show what the Crucifixion really was, without omit anythig. Mel Gibson's work with this movie was incredible. You can see it by reading the interviews with cast and troupe members. The atmosphere in which they worked was incredible. All the resource use by Gibson to give a proper rapresentation of the events was admirable. And without a doubt Jim Caviezel give us the best interpretation of Jesus ever. How he prepared himself for this part is something else compared to a normal actor work. Because for him, for the director and for the majority of the workers on this set it was not a \"normal\" job. It was something more profound and strong. This is what you see in the movie (especially if you read the stories behind the making of it). There are so many powerful scenes: the look in Barabba's eyes when he sees Jesus, Mary that runs towards his Son when He fell with the Cross, Pilate that wash his hands, the death of Judas... It's all so rich of details and precision. The location, the costumes, the screenplay, the cinematography are all really impressive. And the use of the real historical lenguages makes the movie even more perfect. I suppose that the approach to this film by an atheist or a non-Christian it's very different compared to the one of a Catholic but I think that everybody can appreciate a work made with so much dedication and cleverness. The negative reviews, especially the ones from film critics really make me believe that they don't really see the movie or they have been affected by prejudices against Mel Gibson of course and indeed by their opinions about Chrisianity and Catholicism. The ones who accuse this movie of beeing too violent or too graphic have to undestand that this is what happened, simply as that. We see the beginnig of Saving Private Ryan: it shows extreme violence of course but it a true rapresentation of what D-Day was and so we consider it a masterpiece. Why don't use the same treatment with this movie? Why show an historic event (and really, if anybody has a doubt about the historical accuracy of the life of Jesus, please literate yourself with some Roman historians like Tacitus or Pliny the Younger) for what it was it's controvesial? The tortures, the Via Crucis, the Crucifixion was brutal, violent, difficoult to watch but this is what it's supposed to be. If they feel unconfortable to watch maybe it's because they can't or don't want to stare the truth. I honestly can't give this movie anything other than 10/10. One of the greatest movie ever made, and without a doubt the one with the most profound meaning for those who see it and for those who have done it."

      "text": "Part of what works with the movie is that it's not a sermon. It's just a graphic depiction of (arguably) the most important moment in Christian faith. Yes, there is a message going on, but it's more of a \"this is what happened\" sort of thing as opposed to \"Jesus suffered through this so you need to get saved!\"\r It's a very graphic and violent movie. Realism is the theme so no punch is really pulled. At times it even reaches \"Saw\" levels of torture porn. There's no mutilation, but we see a great deal of pain being inflicted on Jesus. Realistic wounds appear as a result and every ounce of agony is excellently captured by Jim Caviezel.\r For Christians this is going to be a tough, but powerful reminder of what Jesus went through for our salvation. It will speak to our faith and makes us feel. For non-believers it's evident that Mel Gibson is trying to reach you by hoping that the gut punch of the films brutal nature hits you hard enough to touch your heart. The results may vary.\r Outside of some embellishments and acts of what I guess you could call \"artistic flair\" this is an almost completely accurate depiction of the death of Jesus as the Bible tells it. The thing that sets it apart from other tellings of the same story is that this one does not shy away from any depiction of the violence that went on. It's brutal, violent, and bloody. Thankfully it also manages to be powerful. Not just for the Christian audience either. Those who don't believe, yet have an open mind can find this movie to be a respectable telling of the of the death of Christ almost exactly as the Bible says it happened.\r The at times downright savage nature of it could be a turn off or even downright offensive to some. Mel Gibson has embarrassed Christianity a lot over the years. However this he got right."

      "text": "As some of the critics argue, this is not a movie that is meant to be a sermon, or to teach you something. It is not focused in Jesus's life, and I don't believe it attempts to be a religious film. It focuses in the last 12 hours of Jesus life as they could have been. Of course by those times many other people were brutally tortured and killed on this way but there is no much mentioned about them because they were just common people. Jesus was different, and either if you believe in what he praised or not , he was a historical figure that changed the life of many, and the spiritual face of the Western World.  Back to the film, the acting was certainly good! The Art direction of this movie was amazing, yet the images were extremely violent, and I had difficulty watching them, but in spite of it, I did. An observation: a few comments below, the user called ANDY mentioned that Anthropologists believe that Jesus looked different and blah, blah. Well, ANDY, curiously, I happen to have a PhD in Anthropology and Sociology, and I also have some education in history and in my 20's I used to be a theatre performer,(now I am just my 30's, and not, I am not at all a nerd or a nerd looking, quite the opposite) so my answer to you Andy is: Don't talk what you don't really know! You are just repeating what the mass-media say! Research in journals and serious academic publications if you really aim to increase your knowledge on the matter. There are many different approaches about Jesus's life. It is also  impossible to know how Jesus looked or not or how did he lead his private life! Therefore,  we should stop referring to petty stuff as arguments against this film, for that is senseless criticism. If Jesus had long hair or not, if he was really the Son of God,  or not,  who cares...! This film is not a  proselyist one!  Finally, let's be fair, just because people do not like religion-and most of people here probably not- it doesn't mean the movie is bad or old fashion! I am not religious myself, but I can still see and appreciate this film for what it is. Guys, this may not be your cup of tea, but objetively, it is a magnificent work!"

The very accuracy and detail of this undeniable work of art justifies its R-rating. Unfortunately, The Passion of the Christ has been sinfully judged by the prejudiced critics who have insulted this emotionally and thematically rich masterpiece for its violence. The world is filled with selfishness and pride and hates God because God is ethically right in every way shown through his holy word known as the Bible, but mankind loves what is evil more than what is ethically good and so mankind will do all it takes to manipulate what is good and make it sound evil while making what is evil sound good in order to gain more power for themselves or to let them follow their sin that they so desperately love and not give it up for the one who died on the cross for them. When it comes to the self-centered and arrogant critics who despised The Passion of the Christ. The brutal, torturous, and horrifying suffering of Jesus makes them feel like they are being guilt tripped because it doesn\u2019t matter whether you were there at his crucifixion or not. You would have done the same thing. The condescending critics want to feel good about themselves and not stare at the truth. They will think of anything to criticize this outstanding artwork upon cinema. The amazing cinematography, soundtrack, makeup, accuracy, and depth won\u2019t stop their criticism of violence, even though all the other R-rated films out there that are more violent and inappropriate without even having a reason that is as good are critically acclaimed. I am honestly shocked that The Passion of the Christ was not even nominated for best picture, but I really should not be surprised. The oscars are possibly just like the critics when it comes to this film. I admit that I hate watching R-rated films. This is not a film I would watch again and again. Even so, I can never deny The Passion of the Christ as one of the greatest films of all time."

First of all, if you believe in this stuff than you would know that nobody is responsible for Jesus's death other than GOD. Jesus was SENT to die bottom line. Secondly, as far a historical accuracy, the bible was edited by the Catholic Church far before any of us read it so, unless someone who was actually alive 2000 years ago is still alive please explain how anyone can KNOW this is actually how it happened. Now that I have gotten that out of the way I can actually review the movie. And I know someone will be upset at me for saying this but as far as the plot goes, there isn't really one. And that is why the critics panned this movie for its violence. It doesn't serve to move the plot. It's just there. The cinematography is execellent as well as the use of subtitles instead of having them speak a language foreign to them. The problem is that people aren't reviewing this as a movie they are reviewing it as a religous experiment. When I go to see a show I want to be entertained I don't want to see someone get the crap beat out of them for two hours. Say what you want about Pulp Fiction but the violence in that movie moved the plot and it was more than just blood and gore. If it isn't Jesus than nobody would give a damn about this movie."

While the movie seemed to be focused too much on the blood and gore it was a good film none the less. The emotion and faith of the movie seemed to be drowned out by all of the blood and pain. One of the only clear moments of the movie was when Jesus (Jim Caviezel) had lost faith in his father. But he quickly regained his faith and was on his jolly way to continue being crucified. While I do believe that the actual crucifixion of Jesus must have been very gore filled, it had much more symbolism than what the film has portrayed. Perhaps Gibson used the blood and pain to keep the audience interested. Need less to say, I would have much more enjoyed a version of the movie that focused on Jesus's or his disciple's thoughts. At the end The Passion of Christ is an accurate representation of the last twelve hours of Jesus's life. But many important ideas and concepts have been silenced by all of the gore. I give this movie a 2.8/5. While it was interesting to watch, it was interesting to watch for the wrong reason. I came looking for a movie that would give me a better understanding of what the people who were at the crucifixion might have though, but instead I was greeted with gallons of blood."
