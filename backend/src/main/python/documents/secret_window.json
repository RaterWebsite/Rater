      "text": "A successful writer who accused of plagiarism.It was based on the novel, though the original title makes more sense than this film. Maybe they wanted to avert the spoiler. But I don't think it would have affected much, because the twist comes at the final segment. The tale of a writer who is in the middle of divorce and now living alone is the lake house got threatened by a stranger, because according to him he stole his story. Followed by many unpleasant events, how he gets out of the trouble told in the next half.Feels just an okay kind. Though Johnny Depp was good. The suspense was good, particularly in the first half, but later it comes falling down. The second half was average, the twist was not interesting enough. After some point, you might predict it, but the point is it was too familiar. I especially did not like the finale, it was like not in detail. Still a watchable film, because of the actor and for decently made. So I think worth a watch if you keep a low expectation.6/10"

      "text": "If you can be patient with this movie and its snail-like progress, this does turn into something quite creepy and chilling. It isn't a jumpy slasher like most of the other popular horror movies, while not outside the talents  of Stephen King, this one took a much more psychological turn. I mean again if you can just be quiet and pay attention while this movie builds, it starts to get scary. Especially if you can consider the idea of this actually happening to YOU. That being said I did think the alternate ending (found on dvd) proved more appropriate for the actual state of mind Mort was in. This did fall heavily on Johnny Depp who can definitely hold his own, but he may have been a slight bit too quirky, a minor problem. Overall it is a tough thing to make a good novella into a movie while staying relatively true to one another. I feel they did that, but it does move slow and the end, while horrifying, doesn't drop the jaw and feel worth the wait. It is one of my favorites though, nonetheless. Approach it openly and it may surprise you, but be critical out the gate and i don't figure you'll be all that impressed. Worth at least one watch."

      "text": "Secret Window: 5 out of 10: I am not going to critique Johnny Depp. He is fine in this movie. And I certainly do not want the great wrath of woman, of various ages, down upon my head. Johnny Depp is a thespian God. He can do no wrong. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory never existed... (God he was awful in that.) Depp\u2019s performance is the most entertaining thing is Secret Window. In fact with the exception of a wonderfully drawn Timothy Hutton in a supporting role, it is the only entertaining thing in the movie. The small cast is rounded out by Maria Bello (A 41 year old butterface that plays Depp\u2019s, cuckolding, **** soon to be ex-wife) and the usually dependable John Turturro who is a disaster.\r This is a Stephen King adaption about a writer going over the edge. (If you saw the Dark Half which also starred Timothy Hutton this will definitely feel like familiar ground). The plot is a familiar train wreck. Depp is a writer going through a nasty divorce and suffering from writers block. There is a knock at the door and Turturro is at the door. With a southern drawl and an Amish tailor Turturro claims that Depp stole his story and has to make it right.\r Ah plagiarism, that old plot twist standby which many a great horror novel is based on. (Or maybe not). Turtorro\u2019s character quickly becomes a nasty bit of work as he kills Depp\u2019s beloved dog with a screwdriver. (This isn\u2019t really a plot spoiler. This is a Steven King adaptation, there are no kids in it to kill and the beloved dog might as well have been dressed in a metaphorical red shirt from the first scene.) This is where the movie officially lost me. Turturro is about as threatening as a Joe Pesci romantic comedy and if his character (named Shooter) killed one of my family members the next time he entered my property he would be renamed shot.\r But the movie cannot let Depp kill Shooter... cause of a super secret plot twist so lame and so obvious that it\u2019s no wonder plagiarism was at the forefront of the writer\u2019s mind. To add insult to injury the movie actually feels it needs to drop hints at this shocking plot twist apparently under the assumption a portion of the audience sniffs glue for a living and didn\u2019t figure it out within 10 minutes of the opening credits.\r The only real surprise in the entire film is the strange Children of the Corn references (Turtorro\u2019s character seems to be clearly channeling Malachi and the last scene is torn right from that mid-eighties classic.) Perhaps the film is meant to be homage to the fine Children of the Corn series... No greater faint praise could I imagine damning with."

      "text": "Johnny Depp is effective in this adaptation of a lesser known Stephen King story, but unfortunately the whole thing comes off as nothing more than a fancy made for cable thriller. It has a big budget cast with a low budget look and attitude. The writing is at times laboured and the direction somewhat pedestrian. Not one of the better King adaptations to film, but, then they're hard to come by."

      "text": "If a movie requires the lead actor to spend a good chunk of his onscreen time talking to himself and Popeye is unavailable because of contractual disputes, it's hard to do better than Johnny Depp. His performance as the trebly beset writer Mort Rainey is the highlight of the underwhelming \"Secret Window,\" which opens nationwide today. This movie is a suspense thriller whose only suspense comes from an audience wondering if the picture will hit its promised 97-minute running time.\r \"Secret Window\" dramatizes the plight of Mort, who is suffering from writer's block. This was triggered by the tumultuous break-up of his marriage to Amy (Maria Bello) and the protracted divorce proceedings. The writer and director, David Koepp, stages the events leading to the end of Mort's marriage so well that most of what follows is a letdown.\r And what follows is Mort, who now lives in a remote cabin, sleeping his way through a depression until a thunderous knock at the door rouses him from a sofa almost as lived in as his bathrobe. He hauls his blond-tipped bedhead to the door, where he encounters John Shooter (John Turturro), which brings up Mort's Misery No. 3. Dressed ominously in a big-brimmed black hat and a work shirt buttoned to the neck \u2014 he looks like an Amish hitman \u2014 Shooter drawls menacingly, \"You stole my book.\" Groggy and astounded, Mort is confronted with the evidence: Shooter's short story reads exactly like Mort's best-selling murder mystery \"Secret Window.\" And worse, Shooter gives Mort three days to set things right, or else.\r Much of the plot turns on Mort's getting his hands on a copy of Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine to prove that he published his story before Shooter wrote his version. And on Mort's need to be home when the phone rings. In other words the film takes place in a charming little seaside town without cellphones, Internet access or a library; sadly, given the current state of affairs, only the last is not so improbable.\r \"Secret Window\" was adapted by Mr. Koepp from Stephen King's novella \"Secret Window, Secret Garden.\" Mr. King's name is noticeably absent from the advertisements for the movie; given that the ABC miniseries \"Kingdom Hospital\" comes from the mind of Mr. King \u2014 sort of \u2014 this novelist's name must be as frightening to Columbia Pictures, which is releasing the film, as the Beatles' lawyers are to Danger Mouse.\r \"Window\" has been opened up to let too much air into the room, and the sluggish pacing will allow even the drowsiest viewer to keep up with the story. A number of amusing little clues turn up, involving some snappy gestures from Mr. Depp. And the director abets the mischief by planting a copy of Tom Robbins's farcical magic-realism novel \"Villa Incognito\" in plain view.\r Timothy Hutton plays Ted, the other man/other menace. (Amusingly, his dad, Jim Hutton, played Ellery Queen in an old series and would have wrapped things up before the trailer ended.) And Charles S. Dutton gives a gentle authority to the role of Mort's bodyguard.\r Pale and disheveled, Mr. Depp rolls through the film in a wardrobe that looks as if it has been slept in, the kind of believable physical detail that never gets costume designers Oscar nominations because it's far too real. What little intrigue the movie has comes from Mort's shattered self-esteem; he asks himself if he really was capable of stealing Shooter's story, vowel for vowel.\r Unfortunately, such a concern may not mean a whole lot to viewers. Then again, neither will the rest of \"Secret Window,\" which has the vague plotting generally found in an anthology horror-show episode. It's the kind of thing that's fine for about 20 minutes, before your attention kicks in, or nods off."

      "text": "Secret Window is a run-of-the-mill psychological thriller with solid performances from a capable past, namely a neurotic and paranoid Johnny Depp and creepy Southern John Turturro. While its tricks that it has up its sleeves are hardly noteworthy, the performances are rock solid and the film is capably directed by David Koepp. While it is hardly a must-watch, it is one that can be watched and you can rest assured it will be solidly entertaining. That said, do not expect too much, as it is pretty familiar when it comes to psychological thrillers and its adherence to the cliches. Having not read the source material, it also feels oddly similar to King's novel The Dark Half, which I have read. Since The Dark Half has been adapted into a different film and this one is based on a short story published a year after that novel, I have  no idea why this film was made. Hell, I do not really know why King wrote a short story on practically the same idea he put in an entire book.After being confronted with a plagiarism accusation from John Shooter (John Turturro) regarding his short story \"Secret Window\", Morton Rainey (Johnny Depp) slowly discovers he is insane. Initially in denial about his own insanity, it quickly becomes apparent that this man should not be left alone as he is a danger to himself and society. While the twist is predictable for anybody familiar with King or movies in general, it is quite well handled and thoroughly compelling all the same. The film has a really engrossing sense of paranoia that really keeps you on edge as Morton begins to put things together and it really has no problems hooking you in from the very beginning.Now, of course, a lot of that is due to Depp. He is never anything less than engrossing, even in bad films. He is sort of like Nicolas Cage in that way. He somehow breathes life into films where the material is below standard. Secret Window fits the bill there and is hardly Oscar-material. Yet, Depp makes it worthwhile playing the anger stricken husband with a cheating wife. His paranoia, neurosis, and obsession are all well-executed and Depp really brings it to life. By the end, you feel oddly sorry for the man as his story comes to life through his own tale. As a psycho, John Turturro is nothing less than stellar. He always brings his A-game and that is very much the case here as he plays the unhinged sociopath with ease and really has great chemistry with Depp in the scenes they share, which is a must.Secret Window is a hard film to recommend. For those that like psychological thrillers, it is a bit too typical to really appeal. For those that do not, it may be appealing, but it does stick too closely to cliches to really change their opinions on the genre. While it does execute the cliches well and the ending is superb in the way it really grosses you out mentally and ties together with the short story he wrote, it is hard an excellent film. It is fun while it lasts with some unique elements, but is mostly just worth it for fans of Depp or the few people who like to check out Turturro appearances."

      "text": "This movie is about a writer unexpectedly accused of plagiarism, after his traumatic and ill-resolved divorce. What could be just an intellectual setback quickly turns into a police case as the writer feels more threatened. We're facing a light thriller with some tension and a good script. But it takes a while to get to the most interesting moments and the first half will seem monotonous, with the conflict between the two central characters slowly becoming more dense. The end, with a good twist, will make up for that. There is a surreptitious link between the importance of film's end and the discussion between the main characters about the importance of the ending in a story.Johny Depp uses an intentional \"I woke up now and I'm hung over\" look to make his character more sympathetic to us. His character have much psychological depth and he manages to put it on screen. John Turturro is his antagonist but, at the same time, he completes Depp's character, insofar as the film relies on the rivalry between them. Turturro made an excellent deep southern accent and used a grim, sinister appearance to look more threatening than dangerous. The remaining cast has more secondary roles."
