It takes half an hour for the actual premise to even start but even once it does, the only good parts with the 2 agents competing/fighting are the ones in the trailer and rest is just RomCom-y dating scenes. There is also some scenes of them hunting down some guy for their actual CIA jobs and they are just a an annoying and pointless distraction. Its not funny enough to be a comedy, and it doesn't have enough action to be an action comedy so its basically just a bad Rom Com."

They both do whatever they can to make sure that neither of them has the chance to go out with her.\r Both Pine and Hardy do share some terrific chemistry as two guys who grow jealous of each other.\r The two men stop at nothing to try and impress, but at the same time make Witherspoon feel disgusted at either of them.\r I rarely laughed here, the comedy is dry, the premise is unrealistically bad and the movie itself is just plain pointless. I guess you could give it the benefit of the doubt that most comedies have ridiculous plots, but when they make it believable, it works. Not here, though."

In this case, I liked the trailer, but hesitated when the critics dogged it.  But I caught a late show anyway, with mega-low expectations, and was pleasantly surprised - I actually laughed throughout this film.  I mean there's BAD (see Katherine Heigl's \"One for the Money\"), and then there's light humor and McG-style action with a heart. This movie delivers the latter in spades. I have a feeling that some of the pro critics shut it down before the movie even got going, because this is not a \"red\" film. I'd even recommend  it - again, for what it is!"

The sad thing is, once again the male characters are too dumb and weak for Reese Witherspoon's character. In 'How Do You Know', she chose a limp, mugging Paul Rudd, and it pushed a movie that was already in trouble over the cliff. Here, the two guys are clearly more attracted to each other than they are to any woman, so the story makes no sense. And the conversations between Witherspoon and Chelsea Handler are just sad. Two smart women who can't talk about a single thing besides men. It's loud, incoherent, humorless, predictable, dumb, and bad. Other than that, it's still not very good."

Its the perfect movie to see if there is really nothing else to see or do because at its core it provides some entertainment particularly at its mid term. Otherwise, this is a bland movie that falls under a predictable and (kind of boring) route. Theres some decent chemistry between the characters, but nothing too outstanding or good for that matter. The action sequences are laughable, and the romance falls into merely believable. What saves the movie is its actual main hook of two best friends fighting for an undecided woman using their arsenal of agency weapons and espionage which does provides some entertaining moments. The problem is when it changes its pace and tries to cover other more in-depth areas, which it doesnt do effectively. In fact, some of the scenes seem unnecessary, some just end with no reason whatsoever without accomplishing anything important- leaving the feeling that it was unnecessary. Overall, this is not bad, but it is not good either, and to be completely honest it strives more into bad than good. Watch it if there is nothing else."

      "text": "I thought this movie was okay. Though critics hated it, I thought it was watchable and I did laugh at some scenes in the movie even though they're quite contrived. I thought it would've worked better as a romantic comedy by itself instead of an action-romantic comedy as the action scenes were kind of dull and didn't really need a villain. The film stumbles whenever it tries to juggle between trying to appeal to both women (Reese Witherspoon's relationship dilemma) and men (Chris Pine's and Tom Hardy's CIA work) and it ruins the consistency of tone. I also found some of the jokes kind of flat and repeating myself, the action scenes are again, kind of dull. Chris Pine and Tom Hardy have the most screen time but they have to keep swapping between each other's scenes with Witherspoon, which is very distracting. Chris Pine plays your typical womanising, arrogant douche bag but not in a likable sense and Tom Hardy plays the nice guy who just wants a serious relationship (contradictory with all his tattoos). Reese Witherspoon was okay but her character has trouble sticking to one personality, either she is an amazing, smart and interesting woman or a dumb broad who doesn't have any luck with relationships. The thing I hated the most about this film is Reese Witherspoon character's best friend who is obnoxious, irritating and just there as a walking sex joke and shouldn't be in the movie at all. The best thing about this film is of course, Tom Hardy. His charm and cool disposition gives the film a charismatic identity though it's strange to see him play as the straight guy and it would've made more sense if he played the womanising douche. Overall, I think this film is okay. It's your typical romantic comedy with a quote-on-quote \"action\" twist but what do you expect?"

There's potential for comedy and combat, but the script is pretty pedestrian with few laughs and the action (with the exception of the final chase) is unimaginative. Both of the men are charming, but lack comic chops. Witherspoon does her best, but the paltry dialogue leaves her little to work with. While it's never dull, it's never especially special or fun."

When somebody knows his goals and limits, he definitely  will earn appreciation, that's the status of this movie, it is just for fun and pass time, no more. Two secret agents (Chris Spine) and (Tom Hardy) compete, unlawfully, for the same girl (Rise Witherspoon), they use the power they have for their own good, tracking each other trails with the girl they both want. The girl is unable of making her choice, her life has dramatically twisted, from suffering  dry times to having to make a  hard selection of a lover from the two offerings. Her councillor and adviser is a friend (Chelsea Handler) who usually gives the non correct opinion.  This short and fast running movie didn't waste time, from trying to win the girl along with some intelligence operations, the romantic final comes in favor of the American agent, the British  agent returns to his ex-wife and son. Don't expect complex scenario or acting, there is no room for either, just laughter from time to time, semi exciting car races and fighting, and some love scenes."

I thought Reese Witherspoon's career was going to be doomed again thanks to the awful 2010 flop with Owen Wilson. But I thought her performance in \"This Means War\" is pretty good, but the whole movie is decent at some point. I have a hard time with this one because the critics are right on the ball and McG should've just stick to Charlie's Angels unless you want to be famous for being a joke of a music video-turned-movie director. Sure, I love romantic comedies, but some sucked including those Heigl what's-her-name embarrassments. And I'm not so sure on the term \"action romantic-comedy\" either. I felt that something needs to change drastically in \"This Means War\" including a confusing script and the chemistry (which is good, but not great) between Reese, Pine, and that other dude.

Attempting to sabotage each other dates through equipment used on the field, they soon come to blows, predictably, over who she prefers. The idea was funny, but director McG missed the point completely, the first mission at the start of the film ends tragically for the enemy which as usual sets up a 'big boss' final battle, which was mediocre at best. Hardy seems to realise halfway through the film, \"what have I done?\" but Pine does to relish his role as the womanising FDR, Witherspoon almost settles back into the ditzy blonde of yester-year we first seen in Legally Blonde. Bane vs Captain Kirk, where did all go wrong?\rWell, there simply wasn't enough of these two beating the hell out of the bad guys or out of each other, these were easily the best parts of the film.\rThis film also fell into the trap of putting all the best parts into the trailer, there was nothing left to ponder, bland and predictable.\rThis score simply because of the talent involved"

It has little redeeming value in way of script or story but the scenes are executed flawlessly and lots of money was put into it; this accounts for the very poor critics scoring and rather satisfying audience scoring in contrast. I enjoyed it for little more reasons than the director's sense of timing and a change of subject matter (after a few heavy flicks, a light whatever this is was welcomed). There are three key characters at play here: Lauren, FDR Foster and Tuck, respectively played by Reese Witherspoon, Chris Pine and Tom Hardy. The other actors with some degree of screen time are Til Schweiger and Chelsea Handler; the former I'm familiar with, am usually satisfied with his performances and is well cast, while the latter I know little about and is also well cast based on this movie's performance. As for the three main actors, I never much cared for Witherspoon and this movie has done nothing to change my indifference; I enjoyed Pine's performance in both the 2009 Star Trek motion picture in which he played the lead, as well as the performance in this movie, and as for Tom Hardy, I'm simply a fan based on nine movies I've seen him in (Warrior, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Inception, Bronson, RocknRolla, Sucker Punch, Layer Cake and Black Hawk Down). If you watch the 2011 movie Warrior and don't count yourself as a fan, don't say you are when he gets nominated or even wins an Oscar one day.
