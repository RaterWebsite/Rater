Some people doesn\u00b4t dislike this film at all,they hate Steve Jobs,one of the most irritating person of all time who made billions of dollar due to it\u00b4s ego and inteligence.\rA biopic of him sounds like something almost nobody would like to watch.\rBut Extraordinaire Director Danny Boyle (Trainspotting,Slumdog Millionaire) controlled 3 moments of steve jobs life that were crucial. And i know,it doesnt show the beginning of Jobs and wozniak with too much detail,but i guess they didn\u00b4want to do again what Hollywood had showed in Kutcher\u00b4s Jobs.\rYes,Jobs is two hours of complaining,but at least show us who and how was steve jobs,not all what he has done...Fassbender,Daniels,Rogen (surprisingly)and Winslet shine in this project...and all thanks to Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and Director Danny Boyle."

      "text": "Boyle's film is gripping and Aaron Sorkin's screenplay is flourishing, not to mention the film's score by Daniel Pemberton has tension. The talented Michael Fassbender owns the rule of Steve Jobs also makes a beyond brilliant performance so does Kate Winzlet, Jeff Daniels and Seth Rogen. The film takes place in three acts, Jobs is back stage preparing for three launch products: the Macintosh in 1984, the Next Computer in 1988, and the iMac in 1998, and in the iMac in 1998, after Jobs had been fired from Apple and then brought back in utter vindication to the company he co founded. People who make a dent in the universe usually do serious damage to their relationships. Through the years, Jobs battles his ex-girlfriend (Katherine Waterston) denying the paternity test of their daughter Lisa, with his longtime partner Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen) his programmer (Michael Stuhlbarg), and with the professional manager he brought in to run the company, Pepsi's John Sculley (Jeff Daniels). He agonizes over the double rejection of being put into adoption and then being brought back by the first people who tried to adopt him. Sorkin's screenplay is smart and Boyle has exhilarating style. It's one of the best films of the year including one of the best performances so far. Grade A+"

Steve Jobs also deserved a worthy biopic about his life as well, which he sadly did not get with Ashton Kutcher's version. This film was film with talent in front and behind the camera and that is why it is so effective.\r I must start with the great screenplay by Aaron Sorkin, who is my favorite for best screenplay so far at this years Oscars. Sorkin crafted some of the best dialogue in a film this year. The film is written in just three different time periods rather than just play right through Steve Jobs' life.\r Now Michael Fassbender is outstanding as Steve Jobs and there is never a moment where you feel that he is acting. He was Steve Jobs in this film. I know a lot of people were commenting on Fassbender not looking very similar to Jobs but that never bothered me. Fassbender's performance says so much about this man and I'm sure that he will have to get some attention for best actor this year and as of right now he just might have my vote.\r Now for the supporting cast. Seth Rogen was great, I thought he was maybe going to struggle with this role, but there is nothing I like more than an actor breaking his typecasting and he did it here. There are several scenes here the Rogen holds his own against Fassbender and the same can be said about Jeff Daniels and Kate Winslet. Winslet will surely be nominated for an Oscar as well.\r Danny Boyle did not exactly steal the show like he sometimes does in his films. This seemed more like a showcase for Michael Fassbender and Aaron Sorkin than anyone else involved and that certainly doesn't drag it down. Props to Boyle for delivering on a great script and excellent performances. Undoubtedly one of the best films this year."

      "text": "I guess it all comes down to how you want to remember Steve Jobs -- the guru who inspired a following of devoted Apple users or a self-absorbed entrepreneur who seized the moment, leaving behind him a trail of disgruntled co-founders, workers and former lovers.  This movie takes the latter approach, but contrary to what some may think, Boyle and Sorkin make Jobs human, richly so in fact, and I think in time even those who have criticized this movie will come to regard it as the best testament of his legacy.\r Whether or not Lisa was his daughter matters little.  What matters is how Lisa becomes the muse around which Jobs built his ideas.  From the start, the Apple was designed to be a user-friendly home computer that would become the \"bicycle\" for our ideas.  A young Lisa immediately seizes its potential and in three highly-charged acts she also becomes Steve's sharpest critic.  She represents the generation that has been brought up on the PC and is now shaping it into an image of themselves through the Internet.\r Woz is Jobs' foil throughout the movie, determined to make Steve give the core Apple team its due, long after Jobs has dismissed this crew as B-players.  This will no doubt rankle the Techies who probably don't see Jobs as anything more than over-hyped promoter.  In fact, Woz accuses him of that in the movie, to which Jobs responds that he is the conductor and Woz is one of the musicians, first row of course.\r The most interesting character is Joanna, a largely fictional construction who becomes Jobs \"work wife\" over the course of the film, reminding him of his moral responsibilities.  This is probably what miffed Jobs' real wife, who is not even mentioned in this film.  But, the filmmakers chose to take a theatrical approach, narrowing the essential characters down to a handful and building Jobs' life around them.\r You can quibble with the authenticity of the film, but that's not what's at stake here.  This is more about  what made Steve Jobs tick.  What drove him to be the leading innovator in the PC industry and how he reconciled this with those around him?  I have to hand it to Boyle and Sorkin to turn this into a richly entertaining film that held this viewer spellbound throughout."

That, and the relentless walking that seems to be the action of this film - a la West Wing and pretty much everything else he writes, made for an exhausting cinema experience - and not in a good way. I found the portrait of Jobs, about whom I know little, as uninteresting as it was unilluminating. Why people kept coming back to be abused by Jobs was disturbing - was everyone in his sphere so in awe and so helpless?"

Does great progress require that one dreamer be so stubborn and such an **** that nothing will take his eyes off the prize?\r There are elements of truth, but many of the factual details are just wrong, and it's hard to say whether the character in the film is a fair portrait of the real man or not. Michael Fassbender does not particularly look or sounds like Steve Jobs, but he's certainly playing something interesting. The odd notion of using hurried discussions before product launches as a framing device is a pretty effective tool, but renders the film incomplete. After all, there were many more important things that happened than can fit into the length of the film.\r It's a Danny Boyle joint, so you know it's high energy and fun to watch. Go in with measured expectations and you're likely to be happy."

If you either didn't see Jobs or Steve Jobs: Man in the Machine or need to contribute more to overblowing this mildly intelligent, morally gray and overcredited computer engineer's popularity, just go for a Sunday matinee.\r If this thing is even nominated for an Oscar I'm going to feel like eating my own head. So unoriginal, so overwrought (as another reviewer commented), such a throwaway subject. Should Sorkin do a movie about Kim Kardashian next because she is popular? What other scenarios can we have characters unrealistically spouting cringeworthy dialogue in fast foward that sounds like an English major put it through 10 drafts before the actor delivered it? Will Danny Boyle ever stop doing that slightly tilted camera shot? Will Jeff Daniels ever stop playing a guy in a suit in a boardroom? Answering these questions should be about as thought provoking as considering Steve Jobs's life."

I thought the movie was mildly \u201cinteresting.\u201d  It depicts Jobs as both a \u201cmarketing genius\u201d who saved the company from bankruptcy and a thoughtless ass-pipe, who was unkind and uncaring toward pretty much everyone human being in his life.  I\u2019ve been told that the movie skips over large segments of Job\u2019s life, and thus some feel the movie is unbalanced or an unfair in its portrayal of him, while others have told me that the guy was, in many ways, even more bizzare than what the movie shows.  All in all, I think it\u2019s fair to say that the movie attempts to give you a sense of who he was without laboring over every detail.  I leave it to others to debate the accuracy of the material presented, but if you\u2019re an Apple aficionado, you may not care for this movie because it colors pretty much all of the company founders as timid or inept buffoons who couldn\u2019t run business selling beer to beach goers in July, much less a computer company."

There are so many flaws with the concept of the movie... First off, you basically have to have read his biography to understand what the heck is even going on which is a lot to ask from the viewer, secondly it's not even interesting it's the same 40 minute scene repeated 3 times with little variation. No character development, no story, no nothing, just people pissed at that one guy that's it. Even Fassbender's performance which received massive praise is nothing special if you've seen him in other movies, he's a very charismatic actor but it's not like he's stretching his range by any mean here it's the same thing he always does, there's no point in the movie where you think \"this is Steve Jobs\"."

There are some boring parts, and in a movie where the directors wanted it to be inspiring, it made it hard to be inspired when you just see angry business men shouting crap at each other.\rOverall, while this movie can be inspiring and powerful, and in no way bad, there are some parts that struggled to be engaging.  If you want to go see this movie, by all means, go see it; it's just disappointing, and I expected better from Boyle and Sorkin.  Ultimately, this movie is just meh.\r Steve Jobs gets a 7/10."

You see them somehow unfairly wronged (so you feel sympathy for them and bond with them).\r An opportunity presents itself and the main character pursues that... and then, about 10% into the movie, the real quest begins...\r Through the course of the movie, we watch the main character pursue their main goal and deal with the challenges that come up in the meantime -- challenges that force the main character to push past his inner and outer challenges more than he/she ever has before.\r At the 50% point in the movie, you reach a \"point of no return\", where the character can't go back to their old life / old way of being, even if they wanted to...\r The rest of the movie winds up at an ultimate test where the main character has to fully and irrevocably step into their new self and overcome their most challenging inner block.\r EVERY good movie and TV show has this.

      "text": "Full disclosure, I am an Aaron Sorkin sympathizer. His critics (who are steadfast in their grudge against Sorkin) be damned, this is another masterful bit of storytelling. On its face value, a movie about three separate tech launches in the world of Steve Jobs has potential to be somewhat of a bore. But this striking and impassioned acting and writing display is nothing short of pure adrenaline. If you have any appreciation for the written word and how it can move like music when put in the hands of the right actors and director, then there's no way you walk away from this movie unsatisfied. The arc does a great job of illustrating the cunning determination in Jobs' pursuit of perfection, and how he used his genius to, both, trample over those that stood in his way and defy those championing the safe investment of sticking to the status quo. They may have glossed over how or whether he mended relationships with those he cast aside - and were vital to his success - but the end result was a moving picture of a flawed genius. Not every movie has to make you feel like your protagonist should be worshiped, and I don't believe this story does, but it makes you feel something about standing for your principles. And there are plenty of times not compromising on your principles can destroy you or the people around you (Jobs certainly did plenty of this), but, I believe, it's fair to say there were at least a few times his uncompromising/self-absorbed persona helped change the world - and it's all right to marvel that."

You know how the book is always better than the movie except in a handful of cases such as:  \"Psycho\", \"The Godfather\", \"Jaws\", maybe \"The Shining\"\u2026  here the book (though a biography not a novel) is about a thousand times better.  The first big mistake was Sorkin writing the script.  He's not a moviemaker but a playwright and one who is in love with his own concocted witty banter and not so much interested in a good movie.  It worked well for \"The Social Network\" but dreadfully does not here.  The subject is highly verbal yes, but this film is way too much so and a director like say Polanski would have smartly thrown out half of the wall to wall dialogue.\rDanny Boyle's (a director I have always liked) stabbings at a cinematic treatment of the stagy script do not work including the use of grainy film stock in the beginning and subliminal cuts to get in back story that appear as errors.  These choices are a complete blunder.  Michael Fassbender is an excellent actor, but incredibly I might prefer the lousy Ashton Kutcher whose portrayal in the lame \"Jobs\" was at least a better and more accurate overview.  Kate Winslet plays an annoying contrivance of a character that is ridiculously unbalanced to the real story.  And what can you say about the casting of a fat slob of a talentless over-paid lucky as **** phony actor playing Steve Wozniak?  They could have cast any fat slob with a beard and that actor (or non-actor) would have done just as well or better.\rThe worst move of all was the silly Hollywood emphasis on Steve Job's illegitimate daughter who takes over the whole story!  A story that could have and should have been epic!  What about his other kids for that matter?  What about his wife who he didn't find until late in life and really might have saved him from himself in many ways?  The film's focus is narrow and dumb, and that is said knowing full well that dramatic license and drastic cuts and economies must be made in adapting such a book and life.  This movie feels very small while something like \"The Social Network\" felt big.  I read the biography in whole, and any other iteration imaginable would be superior to this film.

      "text": "It is often stated that the line between insanity and genius is measured only by success. When discussion turns to that of one\u2019s genius, we find it difficult not to equate that genius with some level of insanity. This is especially true when that discussion focuses on Steve Jobs, the man behind machines that allows us to hold the world in the palm of our hand. Steve Jobs is not simply a film, but is an experience of perception; of history; and of a household name.\r When evaluating Steve Jobs the film, one has to stop and admire the genius of writer Aaron Sorkin. The Academy Award winner extends the parameters of his brilliance through a film that not only allows us an understanding of a complex mind, but accurately illustrates the torments, criticisms and neglect that shaped the man entrusted with its ownership. Based on Walter Isaacson\u2019s non-fiction memoir, Sorkin\u2019s script rockets off the tongues of the film\u2019s talented cast and grabs your attention as you dance through every nuanced conflict of Jobs\u2019 life. Daringly mimicking theatre in its three-piece act structure, the film presents the events of three major launches, and three very different pictures of Steve Jobs (Michael Fassbender), in real time.\r The first, shot in low-resolution 16mm film, set in Cupertino, California, shows a grainy and young Jobs moments before his inaugural Macintosh in 1984, days after the infamous science fiction based Apple commercial. The second, showing the recently axed Jobs, in 1988 at the historical San Francisco Opera House before his infamously disastrous NeXT cube launch in wide-screen 35mm film displays a vengeful and highly orchestrated Jobs. Finally, in 1998, returning to Apple, this time as CEO, utilising high-definition digital film at San Francisco\u2019s Davies Symphony Hall, before his presentation of the iMac. The last act presents to the audience the most human yet morally flawed version of a man no one ever really understood. Each scene, running close to thirty five minutes each, is as enthralling, entertaining and orchestrated as the next.\r Jobs has always maintained a very muddled and misguided personal life; one that includes a young daughter Lisa with a college sweetheart Christen Brennan (Katherine Waterston), very uninspiring social skills as well as a knack for being referred to as unlovable. Sorkin\u2019s script looks to answer one of the biggest questions plaguing the late great tech genius: can a great man still be a good man? Thanks to an electric script by the great Aaron Sorkin, phenomenal performances on all fronts, masterful direction and a brilliant neo-classical score by Daniel Pemberton, Steve Jobs is easily a crowning cinematic achievement and the best film of 2015, in spite of not being the most audience alluring film released this award season.\r From the beginning, the film is a pish-posh of gossip and rumours. Not that anyone thought the film would bow down to the atrocious Ashton Kutcher vehicle Jobs in 2013, but the film did suffer a slew of \u201ctechnical difficulties\u201d going into production. Once in the hands of David Fincher, the film was always setup to be as great, if not greater than The Social Network. With Christian Bale initially cast, the film went through directors, stars and crew like a Daytona racetrack, eventually settling on director Danny Boyle, and stars Michael Fassbender and Daniel Pemberton instead of a roster that may very well have included Fincher, Bale, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. Luckily for audiences, Steve Jobs is not an unwanted and pumped out studio biopic, and focuses less on the look of Jobs and more on the essence of a man struggling with himself more than the struggles of an economically competitive technological world.\r While the film is presented in a very basic three act structure, there is nothing simple about the film. Driven by dialogue, its characters and three very crucial times in the life of Steve Jobs, the abstract delivery of these highly regarded singular events of the 20th century are presented with ease and class.\r In a world where recognition is everything, and being pointed out in humiliation and failure could forever change your reputation professionally, Steve Jobs, logically speaking, had no right becoming a pioneer of technology. He was no engineer, designer or programmer, yet, the world knew his name and the ramifications of his brilliance. In one of the many powerful scenes of the film, when confronted by his cohort and early friend, Apple Co-Founder Steve \u201cWoz\u201d Wozniak (Seth Rogen) what he does. In response, Jobs says, \u201cI play the orchestra!\u201d Often times being measured next to Leonardo Da Vinci, Julius Ceasar and God himself, Jobs was often misconceived as a diabolical man with a plan, giving out the passes to whomever came in his way."

Sorkin has written a 3 act screenplay, each act revolving around a creation by Jobs such as the Apple II, the NeXT and the iMac computers, while Doyle films the first act in 16mm film, the second in 35mm and digital for the third act.\r It is generally known and accepted that Steve Jobs was a cold, dictating boss who never gave credit to anyone keeping it all for himself, gave more love to his technological creations than to any human being, never treated anyone around him fairly, was an impossible perfectionist, always composed, cool and in charge, comparing himself to G-d, Julius Caesar and seen as a bully but even those who hated him acknowledged him as a visionary.\r The fact that he was adopted and given back after a month to be adopted again, being brought up as a Catholic, refused to acknowledge the birth of his own daughter until she was in her teens and his long time, non-sexual, working relationship with Joanna Hoffman (Winslet) who was one of the few who could and did stand up to him, are never dealt with in depth which may have helped explaining the man himself. We learn little about the man himself which is a big failure of the film.\r There is no faulting of the actors from the three, Makenzie Moss, Ripley Sobo and Perla Haney-Jardine who play the daughter at different stages, Katherine Waterston who plays the mother, Mac collaborator Andy Hertzfeld, played by Michael Stuhlbarg, to all the supporting and bit players. Daniels takes his character from \u201cThe Newsroom\u201d a step higher!\r Fassbender IS Steve Jobs even though he may not look like him to start with eventually he is the man you have seen on large stages introducing his products. He handles the pacing of Sorkin\u2019s words and Doyle\u2019s camera along with the anger he feels not knowing how to deal with feelings. The relationship between Winslet and Fassbender though her loyalty to him and why he would listen to her and not others is never explained but because of the actors you accept that it is just what it appears.\r For excellent acting, snappy, sharp dialogue and above average unobtrusive directing plus award conversations \u201cSteve Jobs\u201d is a film to see."

Michael Fassbender's a great actor and I always love his performances, but I honestly couldn't picture him taking on the role of Steve Jobs at first. However, I'm more than happy to say that he gives a performance that's without a doubt worthy of an Oscar nomination! Seth Rogen and Kate Winslet also gave memorable supporting turns and I really think they deserve Oscar nods for this as well. Sorkin's screenplay flows very smoothly with some great dialogue and back and forth exchanges between characters throughout. And Boyle's direction is as confident as ever. Overall, it's certainly not the best biopic, but I can say that it's definitely up there with some of the best films I've seen all year!"

      "text": "A biopic that rings hollow and phony from start to finish. Yes, we're well aware of the title character's shady reputation from news reports and other films, but this stagey, pretentious, poorly written and at times needlessly cryptic account of his life becomes truly laughable and tiresome. Michael Fassbender's overwrought, constantly mugging for the camera performance screams \"I dare you not to nominate me for an Oscar for this portrayal\" (sheesh). Were it not for the solid supporting performances of Kate Winslet and Jeff Daniels, there would be nothing to recommend here. It's now easy to see why the early reviews weren't so kind to this release; it doesn't deserve the praise it has received since."

      "text": "Unlike the typical biopic, screenwriter Aaron Sorkin has set this one backstage just before the launch of 3 different products (Macintosh, NeXT, iMac). While the tech gets a nod, the focus is on the man and his relationships with 3 primary people (Steve Wozniak, John Sculley, his daughter Lisa). Sorkin has brilliantly combined a lot of information into a crowded, time-limited backdrop. Director Danny Boyle has added a frantic, intimate style to keep the focus on the people (all of whom are superb, esp. Michael Fassbender in the title role and Kate Winslet as his \"work wife\"). While demonstrating Jobs' genius, this film clearly shows his gruff professional style and challenges with relationships. A fascinating, informative and compelling glimpse into his life."

      "text": "If you go into this movie expecting a film about Steve Jobs numerous achievements in the world of technology, this isn\u2019t quite that movie, this is more a movie about Steve Jobs the father. The film is anchored by terrific acting, character development, and pacing, which help make the film quite enjoyable. The story revolves not around Jobs entire life, but 3 separate events, and the minutia of the rest of his life, the structure to clarify is similar to last years Birdman, and the film is very different from 2013\u2019s Jobs.\rThe acting in Steve Jobs is superb, perhaps most impressive of all is Kate Winslet\u2019s performance, as through most of the movie she transformed into her character, as did Michael Fassbender. Michael Fassbender will surely receive an Oscar nomination for this performance, as he literally transforms before the audience\u2019s eyes. Jeff Daniels is as was expected reliable and equally as great, but may get drowned out by the other performances. The other notable performance was that of Seth Rogen, who made a turn for the dramatic, and hit a home-run, completely selling himself as Steve Wozniak.\rThe plot of the film is character driven, and in many ways the greatest strength of the film is the character development, especially that of Steve Jobs. Boyle and Fassbender perfectly capture the psychotic, frenetic, genius, bipolar attitude of Steve Jobs, while also showing a great character arch, as he evolves as a person. The film could have been a little too melodramatic, but the direction and acting save it. The acting and character development also help form the surprisingly frenetic pacing of the film. The film is paced like a day in a beehive, where every character is running in circles, never taking a moment to breath.\rOn top of all of the acting, character development, and pacing the film is also funny, at times touching, and different from the other Jobs films. The film represents an award caliber performance by screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, director Danny Boyle, and most of the cast. The only complaint may be the film\u2019s computer and business lingo is occasionally, not often but occasionally, too confusing for a non computer whiz to understand. Using great character development, acting, and pacing Steve Jobs is another great entry in Danny Boyle\u2019s ever impressive filmography."

      "text": "Steve Jobs takes us behind the scenes of the digital revolution, a portrait of the man at its epicenter. The story unfolds backstage at three iconic product launches, ending in 1998 with the unveiling of the iMac.\r Directed by Danny Boyle, from a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin, this biopic could easily have been David Fincher at the helm starring Christian Bale or Leonardo DiCaprio, but settling on Boyle to direct and Michael Fassbender as the Jobs is no slack reshuffle. I went in with low expectations despite the quality in cast and crew, due to reports of a limited release now cancelled in the US. As a tech fan i feel it's came too soon, only two years since the poor Ashton Kutcher effort and five years since the death of Jobs.\r However, despite those criticisms, Boyle and Sorkin have created a highly entertaining drama. Although Fassbender may not look like the Apple mastermind, the mannerisms, voice and overall performance are spot on. You believe him as the arrogant visionary behind the products who will bully his team so he can have his face on Time magazine. Yet we also see the reluctant father, finding it difficult to break down emotional barriers, and eventually making it right with his daughter before it's too late.\r The solid supporting cast includes Jeff Daniels as CEO John Sculley, Seth Rogan as the co-founder and betrayed friend Steve Wozniak, but i was most impressed with Kate Winslet's role as Jobs' right hand marketing woman Joanna Hoffman, chatting and arguing in a soft Polish accent mixed with American English. All of them bounce and clash with Fassbender's commanding Jobs, almost like a dance of egos.\r Most biopics take artistic license to tell a story over reality, and that nagging feeling never really leaves when watching this. However the unconventional narrative and structure presented here is what makes it stand out. The film is broken into three segments, each filmed in a different format. The Apple Macintosh launch in 1984 is filmed in 16mm, the NeXT computer reveal of 1988 is in 35mm, and the iMac event from 1998 was filmed in today's digital format. It's not obvious at first but certainly will be appreciated in repeat viewings.\r There is of course a slight repetitiveness to the events but the two hours runtime flew by. The intense tone comes and goes, with great dialogue and humour. The retro, synthesised score matches up brilliantly and plays a big part for key scenes, sometimes beating softly and other times reaching a crescendo.\r Danny Boyle's 'Steve Jobs' is a tribute to a man that was difficult to figure out, second guess. It's a window to a time in our recent history, so important to our future, shaped by someone we'll never see the likes of again within the tech industry."
