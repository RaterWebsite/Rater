It's preachy in it's themes, its jokes fall flat every time, and its animation looks so bad that it is astounding that the film made it to theaters at all.  Do not take your children to see Norm of the North, you're only making them dumber."

Generic art direction and character design. Stupid story.  Insipid morality but without any common sense. Seemingly ignorant of the ironic criticism it's actually point at itself as a movie. Maybe one or two gags that were possibly meant to be funny for parents? ...Were just offensive and immature humor that might have got a light chuckle in the 1990's at best. Production quality that pales even in comparison to the Coca Cola polar bears commercials. This movie is just terrible. Absolutely deserves the zero it's getting from everyone here. A sad place to see voice talents end up too."

Norm of the North may be entertaining to those who like watching twerking polar bears, but if you're not, do NOT watch this movie. The animation makes it look like something you'd see in the bargain bin at Wal-Mart. The humor isn't even stupidly funny, it's just plain dumb. The plot is paper thin, and the characters are non-existent! Also, can we assess the fact that the star of this movie is Rob Schneider? I'm sure he's a nice guy and all, but out of all of the potential voice actors you've could of gotten, you drag Rob Schneider into the mix. I just... I just can't. This movie is by far the worst animated film i've seen in a theater, and don't give me the argument that it's a kid's movie, and that it'll only entertain kids. When I went and saw this movie, the kids in my theater were bored out of their minds, and when I saw one family walk in, after 20-30 minutes, they left the theater and didn't come back! Seriously, when not even kids can enjoy your film, you've clearly done something wrong. Do not waste your time on this god-awful atrocity.\r Norm of the North gets a 1/10"

The animation for 2016 is disgraceful it looks like it belongs in the late 90s or early 2000s. The characters are annoying and pointless and the lemmings have used some of the worst humour I've ever seen. The voice acting is sub-par I mean Rob Schneider is the main character for crying out loud. There is barely a story in it as well it's mostly trying to send an environmental message to save the Arctic, but by the end of watching the movie you wold want to nuke the hell out of that place. This movie shouldn't be seen or approved by anyone skip this movie entirely!"

The Film had no understandable flow, and lacks even one moment of thought provoking action. The film as a whole is fairly unfunny, though has moments of comical relief that kind of surprised me. I actually really like the character of Norm, who I felt had the best arc throughout and the best voice work, and his companions, the most untelligable characters in this film, easily offer the most laughs. The plot, however, makes no sense and most of the film tries to feel like it lives in the 21st Century, but is reduced to childish jokes. And in comparison to other animated offers of the year such as Zootopia, Kubo and the Two Strings, and even the slightly overrated The Secret Life of Pets, Norm of the North lacks any depth or even principles in its animation design. In grading the film as it was meant to be presented, a children's film, it works perfect for young kids and is sure to keep them entertained. But to anyone who is over the age of about 9, this is just a bad movie. My 3/10 comes from the fact I really enjoyed the character of Norm and his companions the lemmings made he laugh."

It has been 20 years since the first 3D animated feature film came. Not all the films released in this period were great. Some were technically sounded good and some were stories. If you had seen 'Hoodwinked!', you would know how awesome that story was, despite the poor animation production. But this film failed in all the department.I recently finished watching the first season of 'Trollhunters' and 'Miraculous Ladybug'. Even the television made products were much better than this film. Small budget, small production house et cetera is not an excuse. Thankfully, this is not the only bad animated feature I've seen so far in my life, but sadly it joins the list of those titles.Maybe! The little kids could enjoy it, who does not know to differentiate between good and bad. But for the adults, this is definitely skippable film. The best thing about this film was the message it carried, though, even for an animated film and a fantasy film, not convincing enough. It was kind of very similar to 'Delhi Safari'. In some perspective, I thought it was a remake of that. There are lots of other films similar to this like 'Chole & Theo', 'Happy Feet' and so on that you can try them instead.2/10"

The sickness wasn't from any gross-out humor or something vile and vulgar the characters were doing but at the thought that this film shows what utter contempt Hollywood has for the movie-going audience and your children. I started to hate this film but by the end this film disgusted me in a way I never felt before. This is perhaps one of the worst movies I have ever seen somehow make it to the silver screen and get some budget and shows that they think we are a bunch of idiots that will lap up whatever they crank out, but boy are they wrong with me. This film is so bad it makes me respect Jack and Jill, perhaps one of the worst big budget films ever made and shows similar contempt for its audience but this film goes one step farther by targeting children. Personally it should be a challenge for all folks out there to destroy all physical copies of this movie as a civic duty to society"

I just wish they would act like REAL lemmings and walk off a cliff. Piss jokes, fart jokes and other types of raunchy, uninspired humor come from these hairy testicles. Also, the story is as weak as a half-assed Twilight remake written by Hannah Montannah Essentially, some guy wants to build houses in the north pole for cash, but some polar bear named Norm attempts to stop him and Norm is also the only bear in the north that can speak to humans... for some reason. And he can also dance... for some reaso- WHAT IS GOING ON?!This film should burn... BURN IN HELL. Do not allow your child to watch it.
