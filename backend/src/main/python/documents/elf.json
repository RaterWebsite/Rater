He was energetic and quirky with priceless facial expressions and just as witty and likeable as you'd expect from him. The movie successfully avoids dipping into schmaltzy and sentimental territory like most Christmas movies do and the whole cast seem to be having fun. Overall, this is a fun, memorable Christmas movie that deserves a spot among the classics."

The film has a lot of hidden messages that some people will realise. One being about love and how its importance at this time of the year. Another is how you shouldn't put yourself down and how you should always put your foot forward instead of a foot backwards. These little messages are hidden with character personalities and relationships, all what make this film special. You can't deny it's one of the top and most watched Christmas films of all time, and for that I respect it highly."

The script can be a little too fluffy and unfocused sometimes though, while the pace occasionally lags and some jokes such as Buddy eating the sweets felt forced. However, it does look terrific, with the locations striking and the cinematography very nice. The soundtrack is a nice addition too, it made me nostalgic and all the more ready for Christmas. The story while simple and a tad predictable is at least original and well-meaning, while the direction is credible. The cast is what gives Elf its staying power and charm. Although I am not a fan of Will Ferrell, I think he really shone here as Buddy, while Zooey Deschannel is beautiful and a huge part of the film's charm, James Caan is a suitably gruff father-like figure and Bob Newhart is wonderful. All in all, it is a sweet film if you forgive the slightly clich\u00e9 ending, by all means not for all but the cast do save the day. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

The fact that I was able to remember certain scenes of the film (especially when Elf breaks off the little ice berg and leaves the North Pole) proved to me that the movie is a memorable work of Christmas magic that viewers ages 5 & 45 can both enjoy whole-heartedly. But what does one scene prove anyway? So I watched the film again just this past Christmas and I'll admit I was expecting some vulgarity (I didn't see the PG rating). What I received instead is basically what I remembered from my childhood; a fun, comical movie produced by clever story writers and acted by a collaboration of talented actors. I especially love Will Ferrell's talent, and how couldn't you? He plays his part as the innocent elf protagonist exceptionally flawless. The irony in the film is also quite clever and you'll agree once you watch the movie. I recommend Elf to anyone of any age who wishes to sit down (preferably with some hot chocolate and gingerbread cookies) and watch a family fun Christmas movie. Heck! You can watch this movie any time of year; it's season-less. And that is how Elf goes down in history."

      "text": "A Chaotic Christmas.ElfFavreau's take on Christmas does exactly what such feature demands, a lot of magic, a lot of love and a whole lot of innocence flooding across the screen. The first act being of course dipped in irony, as a whole new magical world is projected where most of the jokes are pulled out from the fact that there is a variation in their bodies compared to our protagonist. And this is a theme that never does and would end, from visiting a new city to street, jumping in on new lifestyle, every aspect of it is being mocked at through comparisons.The rest of the structure is familiar, with antics that helps advance the storyline, the humor is never offered in extreme, there is a broad smile on your face throughout the journey; this is Favreau's big win, gullible in its own world and characters, a film has never been so satisfied with itself. As far as gags are concerned it can easily be left to Ferrell himself. His knack of eating too much sugar, his physical comedy, his way of dancing and picking up the phone by saying, \"This is Buddy Help. What is your favourite color?\"; it all bodes well.His commitment of pinning himself down to that amount of childishness is what fuels this film. Favreau has few ideas on his minds that makes him push the boundaries on an emotional level, unfortunately this is where the film gets dodgy, there is very little art for them to draw out the emotions. Favreau should have known better to keep the film light and breezy, for that is where the film shines, a happy go lucky attitude is what it thrives upon. Elf has more human in him, it lops off few taboo subjects, and give you a decent simpler miracle."

Buddy, the main character, goes on all sorts of wacky adventures throughout the story. The story of Buddy the elf is heartwarming and adventure filled. His crazy personality and goofy antics will definitely serve you a good time.    In the movie, Buddy is just a young orphan before he ends up in the North Pole. He grows up believing he is an elf, but always wondered why he is so much bigger than a normal elf. He eventually finds out the truth by mistake causing him to have a whirlwind of emotions. Buddy sets off to find his real father, after he finds out the truth, only to find out his dad is on the naughty list! When Buddy finally makes it to New York City, where his father lives, he goes on a mission to locate him. Buddy eventually finds his father but doesn't get the reaction he anticipated. He is distraught but doesn't give up. By the end of the movie, with some help from christmas magic, he lives happily ever after with his new family .    The story of Buddy the elf has a lot of different characters that affect the story in different ways. All of these characters however, help build the story to what it became. The story wouldn\u2019t be the same without anyone of these characters. The way that  Buddy reacts to these characters is very amusing to watch, sense he is new to this human world. One of Buddy\u2019s most famous quotes from the movie is \u201cYou stink! You smell like beef and cheese, you don\u2019t smell like Santa.\u201d. This is Buddy\u2019s reaction to the fake santas we often see in different stores and malls. When Buddy see\u2019s \u201csanta\u201d he gets all giddy and excited. Quickly however, he finds out the truth and ruins it for the customers and the children inside the store. As you can tell, Buddy still has to learn a few things about Christmas in the human world.    I really enjoyed this script/movie. The reason being that it fit my sense of humor. It had corny jokes and interesting choices for Buddy\u2019s actions. A good quote for this movie would be \u201cYou\u2019ll find life is still worth while, if you just smile.\u201d-Charlie Chaplin. The reason why i chose this quote is because in the movie one of Buddy\u2019s favorite thing to do is to smile. He smiles when his dad doesn't want him or his brother doesn't except him. He smiles the pain away. Eventually, they both accept him for who he is. Which is good. His personality just seems so happy-go-lucky and care free.    In conclusion, \u201cElf\u201d is a Christmas movie classic. If you ever need to just get in the Christmas spirit, you will need to watch Buddy the elf\u2019s crazy adventure. This movie is overall great from the plot development to the characters within the story. But one thing is for sure\u2026 everyone loves Buddy."

Elf is probably one of the best Christmas movies. For the majority of the movie Elf is really funny. All of the fish out of water jokes land, and I love them all. The only thing holding this movie back is near the end they made some, questionable decisions to say the least. Mainly with the getting the sleigh up and running, and of course the central park rangers. Take the rangers out it makes no difference. I mean that was terrible.
