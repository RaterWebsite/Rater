      "text": "For die-hard fans of the original 'Resident Evil' video game series, this film may come as a disappointment, as the general horror and darkness that made the games so unnerving has been ditched here, in lieu of an intense action-thriller. Nonetheless, in its own right, this film is highly entertaining.Milla Jovovich puts in a superb performance as Alice, who is lead into an underground base of a multi-national corporation to do battle with a series of ghoulies and monsters, including a horde of the undead. With terrific co-star Michelle Rodriguez, there is never a dull moment, moving at a furious pace with just the right mix of dry humour, mystery that surrounds the \"Umbrella Corporation\" and its motives, and impressive action sequences featuring an agile Jovovich in the dress she's barely wearing performing some remarkable stunts."

It has an original story, good characters, and extremely good storyline and there's so much in the movie.. action, horror.. the relations between the characters, the way they need to unite to survive.. it's such a good and interesting movie!  I find so weird that people have so many negative critics! I mean, I know it was inspired in the game, and i know Alice isn't in it.. but people need to get one thing straight: those are two different things! and to be honest, I think it's pretty cool that there is a female bad ass the major character!"

Plus, this is kind of new territory here, with the movie actually coming after the game. I still wish I could filter reviews and remove all \"0\" scores. A movie that bad should make you *literally* vomit in your mouth, unable to even watch it in its entirety and sad for the plot of humanity and anyone's soul who came within 10 feet of it. Thus, only a handful of movies would be able to get such a ridiculous score."

There was no Rotten Tomatoes and I didn't read reviews back then so I went in blind. And I utterly enjoyed the movie: the story, the action sequences, the underground \"Hive,\" Mila Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez kicking serious ass, and more. Panned by critics (36% RT) but liked by users (67% RT), Resident Evil was one of the first examples of how mainstream critics just don't \"get\" horror. Movies that try to be artsy get great reviews even as key elements fall flat for the rest of us. The recent \"Beach House\" is a perfect example of this -- it was loved by critics (81% RT) and panned by users (28%). Unfortunately, the rest of the \"Resident Evil\" sequels except for a few moments, rarely captured that first movie's originality and allure.  Instead, check out the writer/director's excellent previous outing \"Event Horizon.\""

      "text": "I've always been a fan of the RE games because of their gameplay and not so much for their story or characters so this movie really elevated the whole brand when it came out. The story here is much more contained both in scope and setting building up tension continuously before an electrifying escape from the hive. OST and cast are also great!At that time the games were more horror oriented than action packed tps so it made sense for the movie to be such a tense thriller and honestly I have always felted it lacked a bit of gore. But it does one thing right that many horror movies fail to realise: make you care for the characters and then kill them all. That's a key ingredient that eventually will be lost throughout this series also because of problems casting the same actors in the sequels.This has become such a classic as while being a modest budget movie it was capable of doing better than the original material and and becoming iconic on its own merits. There are a few boring and cheap moments like the escape through the pipes scene but it also perfectly ties to the Final Chapter which sheds new light on so many details in a clever way. Paul W.S. Anderson is objectively not a good writer but did well here and he's a great director with a unique visual style. You can see it in the beautiful sets designed for this movie and the rest of the franchise. I honestly think he quite invented a new genre with this series and this is the beginning of it all. \"My name is Alice and this is my story\" (worth over 1B$) 8/10 Read my other RE reviews, here's my ranking:Resident Evil The Final Chapter 10/10Resident Evil retribution 9/10Resident Evil 8/10Resident Evil Extinction 8/10Resident Evil Apocalypse 7/10Resident Evil Afterlife 6/10"

      "text": "One of the better videogame adaptations. I must also point out the movie uses only themes, names, concepts and ideas and is not a direct adaptation of any game in the series. Resident Evil while not inventing the genre is the poster child for survival horror games and a well know series in the industry. Over the years there were many games, spin offs, remakes and some controversies. Mainly the game focus on characters stuck in nightmarish situations caused by a virus that causes the transformation into zombies and even far worse creatures. An evil company is behind it in the earlier games. Back to the movie: In a secret underground Umbrella Cooperation laboratory called the hive a sample of a virus and the antidote is stolen. To hide all evidence the cult-print spreads the virus in the complex. The AI named Red Queen is now in full damage control and quarantine mode. Nearby the protagonist Alice awakens in a mansion without remembering anything and is shortly after recruited by a heavily armed group that stormed the house and wanted to enter the hive. So starts the story. We got some good twists, action and menacing situations that have to be solved. The actors are good and deliver mostly. Milla Jovovich is excellent as lead actress in this kind of movies. The rest of the cast is maybe a bit underused or underdeveloped. I only remember Michelle Rodriguez and Eric Mabius to have bigger moments that made them interesting with exception of Heike Makatsch ( Maybe because of a very short screen time). Additionally the script is really good for this kind of movie. There is no time to bore the watcher which means also good pacing. Remember this is an action horror movie and does not have or need a Shakespearean story as it would be not expected. The special effects however looked really good for the time and budget. Overall this is a decent or even good videogame movie. Worth watching and has memorable moments (The Laser scene is often quoted). Be warned that the sequels are not as good and especially the final movie has an awful conclusion."

The original Resident Evil film surpasses the later installments. The set pieces are well done. They feel claustrophobic and unsettling just like the earlier games on Sony's PlayStation. The environments involving underground tunnels and labs are definitely the film's strong point. Overall, it's an average movie that's easy on the eyes. For a movie adaption of a video game it could be worse. Just don't expect good acting and sadly no \"Jill sandwich\" lines."

      "text": "\"Prep for entry to the Hive.\" \"I shot her 5 times, how was she still standing?\"Based on the game franchise 'Resident Evil' by Capcom. A company that is very influential in the world, be with money or political situations, very poweful in different sectors of society. That company develop strange and dangerous stuff in their secret underground location, in one day they face a situation where one virus, the T-Virus, got exposed in the facility and all of the employees died becaused of that. A team is sent there to figure the situation and solve some problems, what they weren't expecting is that they would find a bunch of living dead persons, animals and monsters down there to confront. Directed and Written by Paul W. S. Anderson.]The main story of the film is beyond simple, but honestly, very functional, i think that it did a good job in that. We have some side stories that i'm not so sure, there are the story between Alice and the brother and sister, Matt and Lisa that also got Spencer envolved, i know that the whole point of this part in the plot was to have a reason for the the T-Virus to get exposed and have another antagonist further the zombies, but i don't think that it would be that necessary, the final motivation of what was done there doesn't seem to be worth it, but isn't horrible neither, i just think it could have been better at those moments. The overall of the story is basically get inside of an unfamiliar place for a mission, finding out that it is hostile and trying to get out, but what they face in there and how they do it, for me it is a good point, the situations and arguing with the red queen, the struggle that they went trough, not perfect, but really good.There are some moments that are really funny, but not intentionally, how the team moves, the songs that are played in some parts, some moments are goofy, some work and others doesn't.The action plus horror are funny in some moments, creepy in others and they try to have some badass moments that don't really work. The laser room, for me it is a great sequence, the song, what is happening, it was so distressing, first, not knowing what was going to happen, and then after each time things got more tense and nervous, i could see myself in that **** situation. The first time the team met the zombies were really good, they figuring what they were doing or what was going on, i enjoyed. Now, there are some moments in slow motion, or when Alice faces the Licker, where they tried to be so epic that i found bad, doing acrobatic moviments, or fighting the Licker in a way that it would only work if she was way stronger than it, so there are some moments that was poorly done.The Licker CGI is terrible, and they don't try to hide it in any way, when bad cgi's like this happens, the good to do would be try to hide it, only showing the cgi in dark places and hiding it in smokes or shadows, but in here they used it in places with high lights and together with the actors, so it got really bad in some moments.The atmosphere in this film is really nice, the whole idea of being confined in a unkown place with a bunch of zombies is so dark and feels so good to be in a place like that in this film. The scenarios are all very nice and are essential to making this film that fun. The whole labs and rooms that we go into this movie have such of a dark sense, it is like you can feel the evil, the death in those places, it is so well done. Still about the ambience in this film, how the details in scenario and mise-en-scene made so much difference in making this film good, i love so much the atmosphere, objects destroyed, tables turned and covered in blood, broken glasses on the ground, grids cutted off, cages and a lot of strange stuff with pipes, sewer, flooded places. All of that together with the the zombies plus being under the ground helped into making this that nice.The sound design is also very good, the choices that they made in here in a lot of moments making echoing sounds that the characters don't know what it is, hearing from far away, im some momentos coming from different places, it can give a paranoid position that, for me, worked really fine. Sounds of muttering, groan, incomprehensible sounds in some situations, things being dragged. Still helping into making the atmosphere to work perfectly. The soundtrack have a lot of metal songs, during action moments it worked and made some scenes being funny, probably not intentioned, but still made me laugh. The score have some nice fatures, the sounding and the less of it in other moments do a good job, helps in composing the scenes.This first Resident Evil movie is really good and very different from the others, even if there are a few moments where you can have a shot of what is going to become, but in here the atmosphere is perfect, there jumpscares and good moments, not intentionally funny moments, really fun film."

I was a huge fan of both Mortal Kombat and Event Horizon. I absolutely loved this movie and I still do. This adaptation is sort of a prequel to the first game. The movie centers around a young woman that awakes in a shower with no memory of who she was and why she was there. Soon after she discovers that the house she was in was on top of a top secret facility tat stored bio weapons. One was released and has transformed the recently dead into zombies from people to animals. The movie plays out as if you were playing the game and you are her character, learning about herself and leveling up. The movie is highly atmospheric and very entertaining. Milla Jovovich is such a bad ass and the movie is so stylish with an amazing score by Marilyn Manson. It's not flawless Michelle Rodriguez's performance is a bit extra and some of the digital FX have not aged well. That being said its still fun and surprisingly scary. This is more of a horror film than the rest and pays homage to the undead classics of yesteryear lovingly. I know alot of people don't really care for it but this is definitely my thing. Plus it has the best cliffhanger ending of any movie ever made.Budget: $32mDomestic Box Office: $40mWorldwide Box Office: $103m4.5/5"

Probably deserves no better than a 8, but it can still be a pretty compelling film. It's not about to blow your damn mind, but I really think it's worth the time of day if you are just looking for a sweet zone out film that you can still follow what's happening."

      "text": "It isn't a movie that's going to set the world on fire and it certainly isn't the best video game adaptation out there, but Resident Evil succeeded mildly at making an entertaining, if boring at times, film. It obviously isn't perfect and the horrible CG looks almost stop-motion at times (the Licker in particular could have been done far better, or dropped completely) and it foreshadows enough to give you a reason to watch the sequel."

      "text": "Resident Evil franchise is more than a gripping story. it is the aesthetics of the movies, that with certain scenes are engraved in memory for years. I adore the entire series, and cannot understand why it is not getting much higher ranking, as it is realy very well done, very artistic, not stupid, maybe prophetic, certainly enjoyable. and Alice is the best!"

Just dont expect too much."

      "text": "Resident evil has amazing suspension, though struggles to maintain direction. There is no stand out performances here however, nothing below average. The first half of the movie is very strong until the zombies are introduced. The creepy atmosphere and unanswered question will intrigue even the simplest of audiences."
