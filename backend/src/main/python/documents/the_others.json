Excellently directed by Alejandro Amenabar, who also did the soundtrack and wrote the screenplay, with some amazing cinematography and film editing, \"The Others\" manages to create such a genuinely spooky mood that one just cannot tear oneself away from watching the film through the end. The cast is impressive, to say the least. Nicole Kidman gives one of her best performances to date, as the grief-stricken, somewhat psychotic mother trying to protect her children at all costs. The children actors are excellent, also, as well as the servants in the film - especially, Fionnula Flanagan, who delivers a chilling performance as Mrs Mills.Overall, the film is definitely worth seeing and is one of the scariest and gripping films that will make you wonder about it for days and days..."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "One of the best thriller's I've ever seen.

This isn't a typical \"haunted house movie\" or \"ghost story\" either, and there is absolutely nothing corny about it. Kidman, of all cast members, delivers a fantastic performance (as usual). The film tells the haunting tale of a woman who returns to her mansion, after her husband begins to fight in World War II, with her two young children, who are highly sensitive to light stronger than that given off by a candle, and an elderly woman serving as a nanny. The terror begins when her two children begin claiming to see \"ghosts\", which at first she does not believe, but is eventually forced to, when she sees no coincidence between her children's tellings and the evidence of intruders in the house. If there's one horror movie that should have been won the awards for (at least) Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, and Best Sound Editing at the Academy Awards, THE OTHERS is that film.

Featuring a stellar score composed by Amenabar himself, The Others also has a great lead performance from Nicole Kidman and good supporting turns from Fionnula Flanagan, Alakina Mann, and James Bentley. Relying largely on the fear of the unknown, the film is a major success and really keeps you on the edge of your seat as you try to piece everything together. The great music accompanying the film is also a major player in this role as he truly keeps you on the edge of your seat. The plot as a whole is also very good and the storyline is well conceived and executed. In addition, the twists and turns this one takes really elevate it above your typical ghost story. Finally, the cinematography is gorgeous. Largely taking place at a single location, the film utilizes it to its full creepy potential and quite beautifully at the same time.

Amenabar's execution is brimmed with such panache that it uses concepts of mirage and lightings and such other tricky camera work to scare the bejesus out of the audience rather than relying upon typical hokum equations like creatures or benign art designing to enhance its intensity. The malleable mythological tale with an updated version that actually warps us back to ancient times, is the key and the theme that fuels this poised and reserved tale that is too sincere to its mannerism. The background score is brilliant along with the jaw dropping cinematography, sharp sound effects and fine editing. The narrative is way too sharp than it seems and the primary reason to that is the awareness of the writer of the chemistry and the equation and each tiny characteristic of the characters.

Each mirror on screen, each ray of candlelight, each shady room and each painting, everything that Amenabar places on screen, he is fiddling with you subconsciously while we sit nervously and our fingers half eaten off as he narrates it.

While her husband is fighting the Nazis, she lives isolated in a Channel Islands mansion, keeping the house in partial darkness along with three mysterious servants. The lead role is played by Nicole Kidman, who does a brilliant performance in a character who sometimes seems very loving, almost needy, and other times seems unusually hard. But she's just a woman trying to bear a burden that seems heavy: the burden of carrying everything back while her husband is away. The children are equally interesting: played by James Bentley and Alakina Mann, two very competent young actors, they are naive, sweet but also very mischievous, and their mischief contributes greatly to the suspense, especially the girl. She seems to know something that nobody else knows or to have a particularly sharp intelligence. The father, played by Christopher Eccleston, is almost a mere figure. He is purposely an absent character who is permanently present for the simple fact of all the others are constantly speaking of him, and this absence has great importance to the psyche of his wife. But the true life of this film is borrowed by Fionnula Flanagan and Eric Sykes who (along with Elaine Cassidy) give life to the house servants. The way they acted and how counter-acted with Kidman is brilliant, giving the film a deeply conspiratorial atmosphere. The constant darkness, the gas lights, the huge old house, the permanent haze surrounding the grounds are clich\u00e9 elements that give the film a touch of elegance and help the audience to grab to the movie until the end, which is quite unexpected and disconcerting."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I thought it was a good movie.
