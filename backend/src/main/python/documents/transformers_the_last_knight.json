Every time when Michael Bay directs a Transformers movie, he always add explosions and useless potty humor to make his movie entertaining for his sake. Jesus Christ.. where do I have to start this? Okay, first of all, the visuals and use of CGI were outstanding but at the same time, everything in this movie is ridiculous. Everything from lousy directing, choppy editing, rushed pacing, annoying characters, and the screenplay of this garbage film is cheesier than a Nickelodeon TV movie. Second, HE ADDS WAY MORE EXPLOSIONS!!!! Michael Bay always have a strange fetish using explosions everytime he adds them in every movie he makes. In almost every scene he makes that involve explosions, it does not do anything to make his movies better. Matter of fact, he's making it worser than previous Transformers movies. Lastly, WHY DID HE MAKE THIS MOVIE??!! Bay's motivations is aiming for money and that's pretty much it! The only positive that I can give to Bay is his departure from directing future Transformers movies and that's it. Hey Bay, I can assure you that you will sweep the RAZZIE awards in no time because this movie is a waste of time!"

All superhero movies have the same basic concept, but the characterization of the concept of transformers and such marvelous acting, direction, action and cinematic visually appealing excellence is something i can enjoy any day. It is one of the most appealing movies and there being so many negative reviews about this movie is unimaginable. I don't know whats wrong with the critics and movie goers. Its only that i guess their expectations from a movie are wrong and hence they are disappointed"

      "text": "Transformers: The Last Knight is hilarious. Not because it's funny, but because it's ridiculous to the point of eliciting laughter. I was honestly shocked at just how stupid this film managed to be sometimes. After Age of Extinction, I thought there was no way these movies could possibly get worse. Unfortunately, I was wrong.The same basic plot we've seen four times before makes a return, but this time, by hugely convoluted means, the film forgoes all logic and upends the franchise's continuity, clearly for the sole purpose of setting up future spinoffs. Sadly, the action isn't even good enough to make up for any of that.This movie was also shot with like seven different cameras, so the aspect ratio is always shifting. It's incredibly annoying. All of the charm this concept once had is gone, and the only hope of getting any of it back is to completely reboot the series, or to prevent Michael Bay from having any creative input moving forward."

This is a giant mess like the last three, there is so much going on that your head will spin and you just care about anything or anyone.  The dialogue is some of the worst in any Transformers movie with good old Bay throwing in useless scene after useless scene.  Mark Wahlberg is fine, Laura Haddock was an upgrade, Isabela Moner was okay but pointless, Josh Duhamel and John Turturro were there because they were in some of the other one but overall wasted, and Anthony Hopkins was out of his mind.  Overall Bay does it again, a beautiful looking movie with no substance and awful dialogue.  D-"

      "text": "While I can say that the Last Knight is a better film than Age of Extinction, with slightly improved CGI and a shorter run time, this film is still a heaping pile of garbage (to put it kindly). The film's writing, story, characters (robot and especially human), and final act/battle are absolutely awful. Even worse, scenes and characters seem ripped out from other films (a chase sequence seems ripped straight from F&F, the little squeaks character is a complete BB-8 type, etc). The action sequences that are there though are so boring and wane in comparison to some of the other films. I pray that viewers don't see this film and give paramount incentive to make more of these embarrassments to blockbuster films and film in general."

The CG was great, they finally slowed down the fight scenes and added more vehicles besides sports cars.  I don't know who the target audience was. The swearing and violence was not for little kids but the humor and dialogue seemed like it was written by a 10 year old.  It had a lot of great (voice) actors saying really bad lines. Hearing Jim Carter (Mr Carson) quoting Ludacris was a disgrace."

      "text": "Much more entertaining than I initially thought it would be. Yes, it's still a Michael Bay movie. Expect explosions, nonsensical storytelling, and takes on the Autobots and Decepticons that are so bland the characters almost completely indistinguishable from one another provided their names aren't Bumblebee and Optimus Prime. However a much needed change in tone from the last movie and the infamous director not taking things seriously in any way make for a more enjoyable movie than one might expect. Just don't come for the plot or anything other than the action and some cheap laughs.There's a surprisingly large cast of familiar faces involved in this ridiculous new take on Transformers lore. Among them is Anthony Hopkins for some reason. Michael Bay clearly enjoyed having the respect actor around to use, and Hopkins himself seemed to be having a blast despite that starring in a movie like this is him just slumming it at this point in his career. While he still ain't no Labeouf, Mark Wahlberg's character is so much more likable this time around. Something that's due to the plot not giving him any extra baggage hanging around in the form of his character's obnoxious daughter and her useless, statutory rapist boyfriend (no, it's cool. There's this one law...). They, along with the material, aren't here to choke out the actor's natural charm. The material is so much lighter than that of the previous film \"Age of Extinction.\" Bay goes for a lot of different kinds of gags and ends up filling the movie with almost wall-to-wall humor. A move that is much appreciated. The plot itself is crazy. It regularly jumps back and forth from different locations and even time periods in an effort to come off as complex. Instead it just feels convoluted. It's easy to lose track of certain characters as they get left behind for large parts of the film only to pop up later. I actually forgot about Cade Yeagers new human cohorts there for a while. Naturally, this isn't the kind of movie you watch for good writing. Michael Bay is known for making movies for teenage boys. Here he really embraces that.The Last Knight is much lighter and surprisingly more diverse than the other Transformers films. You even get some pretty cool action scenes that aren't just explosion fests that rely more on the physicality of the actors. Of course there's also some gorgeous sci-fi scenery. Those underwater scenes are astounding. Ultimately, this is still pretty brainless entertainment. As far as the writing goes, it's the most incoherent Transformers yet. However, by embracing the absurdity and silliness, and just going for jokes and spectacle, Bay crafted what might just be the best Transformers movie yet. For whatever that is worth to you."

One of the main characters is a 14-years girl awkwardly portrayed as some kind of sexy, post apocalyptic fighter (wtf is wrong with you man?!). Incoherent, frenetic and chaotic storyline that tries to blend together the following themes: giant alien transforming robot, King Arthur and the knights of the round table, dragons, demons, Merlin, a robot god/sorceress, comedy moments, a planet eating other planets, USA marine forces, secret English society....and Anthony Hopkins.Please, Michael Bay, please stop raping my childhood...I'll give you my lunch money..."

Without those how am I supposed to feel anything about whats happening in a movie? Even basic archetypes can work if well executed(like ID4 and star wars). A good, compeling plot and a good character you can care about are not necessarily oscar worthy masterpieces as long as passion and love for the project is involved. These can tie a movie together. Bay does not seem to care about these at all. Just make the next one and be done with it. Just throw in racist and sexist jokes, some pretentious attempt at diversity(im neither SJW or a feminist), and american army and thats it. All done by the numbers. The movies are not even about transformers! The girl you see in the trailer rivals the boy on the phantom menace. Its there by chance and does nothing. The movie is full of unfunny, juvenile jokes, like that one friend you have that just keeps making fun about anything and saying unfunny jokes. TF5 is just a compilation of CGI demo reels, shameless product placement, and america military pornography. And people keep paying for it!"

I brought my friends to watch it and one of them fell asleep for half the movie while the other ones are just so bored of it.Nothing makes sense for these movies and this is going to a real insane lvl and it really defies logic. It's so hard to even find something good to say about this movie; even when the action scenes seem really cool and in a big scale, I didn't feel the immersion for it like in other movies...The decepticons get nerfed so hard in this movie especially Megatron and the main villian Quintessa doesn't even pose a threat; she led to her to own demise by even holding cybertron at that very spot!The main highlight for this movie was ofc the fight between bumblebee and Optimus; I think that was the only part I was engaged and thought it was alrightIn the end Transformers the Last Knight is horrible... Like really really bad. 1/10 is for the effort they put in but in reality this is really a 0I can't even call this a movie....

      "text": "I am a big Transformers fan, the Michael Bay films have generally appealed to me to a certain degree up until now, but The Last Knight is just pure rubbish. It comes close to Suicide Squad levels of bad.Let's just agree that the first Transformers film was great. Thought Revenge of the Fallen was bad? At least it had Jetfire and the Fallen, it could have been better if it wasn't victim of a Writers Union's strike at the time. Thought Dark of the Moon was crap? At least it had Sentinel Prime, Shockwave, the giant Worm and Cybertron but didn't feature Devastator's metallic balls or the twins. Thought Age of Extinction was a joke? At least it had the cool Dinobots and Cybertronian spaceships with giant magnets. But The Last Knight is even worse. It's the worst Bay-directed Transformers film by far.It's a series of nonsensical character plot arcs which are either forgotten later or thrown in the film in an atrocious way. No spoilers ahead, it's all in the trailers already. If you mix up King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, Merlin the Magician, 3-headed Dragons, giant spaceships, a female English Historian who looks for a man, Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg's character) who just so happens to be single, a teenage girl, an English Lord and his Transformer butler, a human anti-Transformers paramilitary group named TRF, the Quintessons, and the Transformers, plus Michael Bay, you get The Last Knight.Light spoilers ahead (no, not really). For some reason the TRF decide to make a deal with Megatron who asks for the release of some of his captive Decepticon comrades with laughable names such as Nitro Zeus and Dreadbot, but (unless I missed it) humans asked for nothing in return. The film's Writers even go so far as to make Antony Hopkins' character a member of the ancient, centuries-spanning \"Witwiccan Order\" to make fun of Samuel Witwicky (aka former Transformers lead actor Shia LaBeouf, who was fired just like Megan Fox). End of light spoilers.OK we know the Bayformers film series never had any serious plot, but at least they always had spectacle which WOWed the audience. The Last Knight lacks even that. Sure there are robots bashing each other, but the fights are boring. There are scenes where everyone is firing their guns at the enemies but it seems more like they are shooting at nobody really. Then there is the torn apart Cybertron in all its giant-pile-of-rubbish glory. And there is a scene (as well as in the trailers) where 6 enemy robots place their heads in such a wonderful position for Optimus Prime to effortlessly cut them off in a single sword swing, and he's supposed to look badass but I just thought it was bad cinematography by Bay. Oh, the film even has Hot Rod in it but if you were waiting to see the Rodimus Prime storyline unfold you are wrong. The name of any robot in the Transformers films series means nothing, you could name them anything you wanted to but it's up to Bay as to what to do with them.The only (maybe) positive thing in the whole movie is the Marvel-esque mid credits scene which is a tease for the next Transformers movie.All in all, The Last Knight is a really bad film, even by the Bayformers low standards. There is going to be a 6th film for sure, but I hope Michael Bay stays true to his word and doesn't come back. I 'd rather see a complete Transformers film reboot. Start it all over, get the Transformers mythos right, and pretend the Bayformers films never existed."

From the very beginning it was going so fast it wanting to start the movie but it just got boring from then on. I might not be on the right here or where are my facts, well the fact is, the movie is boring, bad, bland and it's just a terrible. \"The last knight\" it's like five seconds of telling who it is but doesn't explain it after that. They probably do, but I wasn't listening because it was so freaking boring. The writers are terrible, who asked seven writers to tell this story. Each will have their own say and just give it to Bay like,\" Hey we just got a new scene to put in the movie can you put it in?\" He do, and then theres all these other writers wanting what they want. It just a mixture of everything that goes nowhere. Megatron is horrible, this part is hilarious though, they tried to make a suicide squad movie in it and it could've been more interesting then the movie that I was watching. Please watch something else if you can, if you like these other kinds of movie, then go ahead this is only my opinion. You might ask, \"Why go watch it if you know it's going to be bad?\" Well  I try to open my eyes and see how things can improve if it doesn't then here I am. Bad movie! Bad directing! Bad acting!

Loud, mindless action with robots clashing and debris flying everywhere, little to no story, abysmal dialogue (with this film setting a new bar for that standard), and more and more explosions from none other than Michael Bay, who does it better than anyone else! Needless to say, this is exactly more of the same, and I personally found this to be the worst installment thus far! The nonstop action and mindlessness of it all had my restless leg syndrome kicking in full gear not even halfway through the film. The dialogue and corny moments with the characters in the film hasn't felt this absurd since some of the most truly awful moments from the second film, and the talent of all involved is simply wasted, there's no other way around it. It's bad enough that Mark Wahlberg felt the need to involve himself once again with this nonsense, but Sir Anthony Hopkins!? What was he thinking!?!?!? Overall, for those who still somehow enjoy the mindlessness of this franchise, great. For those possibly looking for redemption or getting their hopes up that this is somehow better than the previous installments in any way possible, steer quite clear."

      "text": "Two species which are not at war anymore: film critics and audience.The \"Transformers\" saga has come from more to less. Starting exactly a decade ago, Paramount Pictures broke into Hasbro toys, adapting them into audiovisual products, those metallic giants found on planet earth a provisional protection. Shia LaBeouf's rebellious young role, the eye candy who Megan Fox turned out to be, Michael Bay extravagances idealizing sequences as hilarious as showy and the narrative delusions implanted in a script that is out of touch, all the above imparted the rules by which the following movies would be ruled, without the possibility of an iota of irregularity. It has become evident that complaints about this franchise don't cease, however, the film studio doesn't step down by seeing the answer, ironically, positive at the box office, causing a disagreement of opinions between audience and reviewers. Nevertheless, the movie with the power to converge these two opposite poles in an exact point of embarrassing dejection, describing the most recent installment of Autobots and Decepticons with adjectives as very long, cacophonous, intelligible and sleep-inducing.Navigating more than seven scenarios, the story follows the customary leading role Cade Yeager, accompanied by unusual characters as, nothing more or nothing less, Merlin and the Knights of the Round Table, who are starting point for development of the plot; Vivian Wembley, the only living descendant who can take up his sword; Lennox, military captain who hinders goals of our heroes, Izabella, a girl who cures Autobots introduced to possibly inherit the unlikely franchise or the amount of coming spin-offs; Sir Edmund Burton, faithful sentinel of the genesis of Transformers; and the ideological troubles of two races that are at war in the same world, some humans and other metallics.Openly, the salvable compounds in this sea of nooks are limited, unnecessarily, convoluted and lacking any vestige of attraction, generated by a quartet of writers with highly utopian ambitions, which strive in opposition to a narrative barrier in which no longer keep the same expectations. Such information that slides through Nazi, alien, Mexican, Cuban, European, North American and even medieval settings causes, either from water, air or earth, the feature film feels exaggeratedly longer than the previous outstretched films. Action intervals are inscribed into the plot with decisive rigidity and aren't sufficiently suggestive to pretext the mechanical yawns turning up from the middle of the runtime and is rapidly intensified over longer final climax. As for dialogue, written at six hands by Art Marcum, Matt Holloway and Ken Nolan; It underlines coarse update surrounding the criticized racist misogynist manias of the franchise, which are enhanced by equipping the eye candy with Oxford university titles and doctorates, intellectual glasses and a heady black dress that makes evident that, in fact, nothing has changed. It's enviable the support that Paramount Pictures offers Michael Bay to quench his idealized film dementias, some grandiloquently materialistic and other exaggeratedly pretentious. I said enviable because, personally, I feel a strong connection with this directional kind, also evidenced by Jordan Vogt-Roberts in the recent \"Kong: Skull Island\", of course, referring explicitly to the visual aspect. Propagating with a striking commercial paraphernalia, the fifth installment in the saga is the first to be filmed, entirely, on IMAX 3D cameras, state-of-the-art devices that give majestic images, boasting technical capabilities that embroider the spectacular. Without a doubt, the talent of this director lies in cinematography, the knowledge to fit precise pieces that, here, are harmed by the arrhythmic editing work, emphasizing the variations of aspect ratios that the sequences ache, an unintentional distractor. Fleeting bursts, frantic chases, metal hits, shiny frames and whimsical landscapes file throughout the film, a summer cinema show lacking a good edition work and excitement.Announced in advance, the retirement of Bay and Wahlberg from \"Transformers\" franchise gives an air of hope and faith to restructure the unlikely future installments, since, what has been achieved with \"the Last Knight\", puts the plans of the studio at risk, seeing the unfavourable reception of both critics and audience. However, it cannot be categorized as an absolute film disaster because, although it contains flaws equivalent to the budget in editing, soundtrack and script fields; what the director and his artistic crew do with the scenes deserves enough merit to overlap the yawns and naps attempts in theatres. Yes, this is the only reason to see the movie, you've been warned, experience it in IMAX cinemas, with the largest screen and the most suitable position. Sit down, buckle up and try to enjoy this resounding candy conceived by Bay."

It goes introduction, build-up, climax, build-up and then finally climax again. Another issue is the overlapping stories, at the start, it feels like there are 3 stories, a few minutes in they cross, then they split again but into 2 stories. They cross again at the end but it was so sloppily done that for a while I'd forgot I even had the criticism. This has to be one of the poorest, messiest laziest films I've ever seen."
