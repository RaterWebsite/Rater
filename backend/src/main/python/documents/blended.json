It had funny jokes but it should have been M (PG 13 in USA) then PG in Australia with jokes about jerking off. It is funny and should be seen by people who love comedy,people who are dating,people who married and kids over 11. The movie has a lot of funny jokes and the story shows two people who hate each other coming together like a family."

I was hoping to see some of the Sandler-Barrymore chemistry but that must have fizzled out because there wasn\u2019t anything real, aside from a very expensive vacation for the cast. I find it indicative of how Hollywood expects its leading ladies to look and what its leading men can get away with. Imagine if the looks were reversed- a lumpy, messy Drew Barrymore and a good-looking, in shape Sandler falling in love with her.\rVerdict: Skip"

It's got the same cast of characters that were in grandma's boy happy Gilmore etc. Drew Barrymore has great chemistry was Sandler and Terry crews added just enough of a comedic injection. After having seen the very boring Godzilla last weekend this movie was a real treat.

      "text": "Sandler's third rom-com with Drew Barrymore manages to be an entertaining and mostly funny experience. The romance feels artificial and forced, so it's the interactions with the children that will have you thinking \"aw, that's sweet.\" There are some laugh out loud moments throughout, but I'm surprised at how much of the early humor falls flat on it's face. It takes a while for things to get regularly funny.\r In a lot of way it's your standard Sandler flick. So that means if you're not a fan of his work then you shouldn't bother with this one. It's got it's funny and sweet moments, but it does noticeably have it's issues. Probably chief among them being that the Sandler/Barrymore chemistry that was on display in \"The Wedding Singer and \"50 First Dates\" is missing here.\r Still, it's an overall funny enough movie to make it worth a watch. So long as you're not one of those people who has a particular distaste for Sandler movies. It's rom-com that succeeds more with the comedy then with the romance. I did enjoy it though."

After some forced plot issues that seam a little too farfetched to actually happen Sandler and Berrymore end up going on a vacation together with there children and are forced to spend there trip together. Once you get over the unbelievable setup and the movie starts focusing on the families interacting with one another this movie becomes a real joy to watch. Many reviewers criticize this movie for having some sappy 50's stile family values attached to the plot, any I would haft to agree, but I do in a positive way. If anything i found if they were to town down the adult humor of the film they could of got a more families to see this film, though I do find that with a lot of Sandler's films. There are scenes that are overly silly and over the top at times, but this film is meant to be a comedy.\r This film was made to be a fun filled and emotional story where people and sit back and have fun. I think a lot of people with todays critical eye cant see that anymore. I say just sit back and enjoy the film for what it is. I think you'll especially get a kick out of it if your the one who misses that days of family sitcoms."

The film follows two families who are stuck together while on vacation in Africa. The result is a hit and miss due to shallow, poorly timed jokes, terrible acting and a predicable, clich\u00e9 formula. It was hard to see a potentially good comedic storyline go to waste. I was slightly entertained with some of the creative one-liners and simple jokes, but that\u2019s it. Drew Barrymore was very distracting during the film because of her subpar acting and the fake character she portrayed. All the characters in the movie felt unrealistic to the point of not being entertaining. The conflict between comedy and what should have been a serious subplot, simply didn\u2019t mesh. Emotionally, this movie would almost suck you in, then a lame comedic, very unnatural moment would ruin it. Blended is a mess that wouldn't be a tragedy to skip."

He has mostly had awful movies recently I am not going to lie. I walked into this movie with no expectation at all whatsoever. The first half of this movie was awful. There was a cute scene where adam sandler and his daughter were having a bonding moment watching cartoons in the bedroom but this scene wasn't until after we get introduced to the horrendous kid Brandon of Lauren who love ladies and lots of inappropriate stuff. the other kid was not so bad. However I wanted to punch some sense Into Brandon face. He just was not funny at all. Fast forward to the part where Jim and Lauren unexpectedly meet up in Africa and are forced to share the romantic suite. From here we meet the hilarious terry crews who shows up at the most random parts of the movie and has his choir sing and act on everything that's going on at random moments in the film. There were a couple of other cute scenes where Lauren and Jim bond with the others kids and terry crews makes one final hilarious appearance before the end. there are many other sweet moments shared between the families and to be hones this movie is miles better than pixels, grownups jack and Jill etc. Is it perfect no. Does the comedy hit the spot every time no. In fact some of the comedy is downright horrible. This is the closest I have seen sandler try to be within the kid friendly range sense bedtime stories. but the biggest problem I had with blended is that It can not decide what is wants to be. A juvenile comedy, or a family friendly comedy. Is worth buying no. Renting? yea. Check it out and see what you think. Overall blended shines in sports but tends to be overshadowed by lame juvenile humor that keeps this movie from being great."

This film is about two single parents named Jim and Lauren that go on a blind date that does not go well.When they  both get vacations from their boss and friend to the exact same resort and at the exact same time. They are both unaware that the friend and boss were in a relationship and the vacation was for there families. Which forces both of their families to vacation and share hotel rooms together. The reason why these two are single is because Jim's wife died and Lauren's husband cheated on her and is kind of a jerk. As the kids start to like each other and the parents as well the movie reveals that this resort is for families that want to blend together. Lauren has two boys and Jim has three daughters. And the movie shows the parents blending with the other kids and teaching them new things. This film ends with Jim and Lauren being in a relationship. This is one of my favorite films of all time."

There is, however, one man that goes to no bounds to try and captivate his audience, well...captivate is a strong word, in fact, I now regret using the word \u201ccaptivate\u201d.\rRegardless, the comedian i\u2019m summing up is the talented and (sometimes) funny, Adam Sandler. The latest comedy, shockinlingy doesn't come from long time directing partner, Dennis Dugan. Instead, \u201cZookeeper\u201d director Frank Coreci is taking the helm on the comedy \u201cBlended\u201d. \u201cBlended\u201d marks the third on screen appearance of the \u201cdream team\u201d and this time by \u201cdream team\u201d I mean Drew Barrymore and Sandler. Their last two films together \u201cThe Wedding Singer\u201d and \u201c50 First Dates\u201d are timeless, and to this day I still value and appreciate those films. Partially because the chemistry between Barrymore and Sandler was so real. This time around in \u201cBlended\u201d while yes the chemistry is still there, after three films I have to admit, the on screen \u201cmagic\u201d does fade away, and much like EVERY film of it\u2019s genre before it, \u201cBlended\u201d falls into a slew of dumbfounded gags, that will satisfy a toddler. Oddly enough the film does have more sentimentality then you would think, and there is a decent comedic performance put forth by our two charming leads.\r Jim Friedman (Sandler) is a widower with three daughters, and Lauren Reynolds is a divorcee with two sons. The two are set up on a blind date then goes horribly wrong. One thing leads to another and well.. look we are in Africa. The audience never needs to understand how or why the two families end up in the same place, because..well that\u2019s the story.\r At it\u2019s best \u201cBlended\u201d reminded me of the days when Sandler would make genuine and quality films. Releasing garbage like \u201cJack and Jill\u201d and \u201cThat\u2019s My Boy\u201d also in comparison, \u201cGrown Ups 2\u201d each of these films had benefits of their own doubt, but undoubtedly they all lacked that classic Sandler effect..that was..well\u2026 funny. Barrymore has not really made a film in quite some time, and I thought the on-screen romance was a bit too cliche for my taste, but believable enough to the point where I could surcomb to the flaws. The film has a somewhat family friendly rating, I don\u2019t necessarily know If I would let my children watch some of the jokes in this film, which at times are extremely offensive, and the jokes leave no one unscathed. The African characters all fall into vicious stereotypes. However, I couldn't help myself but laugh at the timing of Terry Crews, and his signing capella group that showed up at all the awkward moments in the film.\r Besides, I never believed for one second this film was actually shot in Africa, because other than a few shots of Giraffes and Zebra\u2019s thrown in. This was the worst set up of any \u201cAfrica\u201d set I had seen. In the end, if speaking honestly, \u201cBlended\u201d is harmless and heartfelt. Well it maybe a little too crude and vulgar for younger children. Some families could find \u201cBlended\u201d to be a viable option for moviegoing. I would suggest to tread lightly. It\u2019s nowhere near the levels of \u201cWedding Singer\u201d and \u201c50 First Dates\u201d. But, if we\u2019re talking comparisons it\u2019s a much better Sandler outing in the last couple years. The film of course is extremely predictable, and goes in the exact direction most people would suspect. So never I was surprised. In addition some of the gags we\u2019re just plain childish and I\u2019m not going to conjure my time and effort explaining them to you. When it comes to the movie \u201cBlended\u201d use your best judgment, and decide just how much you like Adam Sandler.\r C\r By: Nate Adams\r Directed By: Frank Coreci\rRated: PG13\rRun-Time: 111 mins\rRelease Date: May 23rd 2014\rStudio: Warner Bros Pictures\r Thanks For Stopping By."

Surprisingly one of Adam Sandler's more recent palatable movies, thanks to his humanization by Drew Barrymore, the film still lacks any originality or substance. The script is repetitive, using extremely racy comedy in what is supposedly considered a family film. The premise of two broken families merging is not a new one, but the chemistry of Sandler and Barrymore would have been enough to create an entertaining film. Unfortunately the over abundance of stereotypes and prejudices mixed with a terrible misuse of themes causes this ship to sink. A promising niche date film turns into a vulgar attempt at comedy with family aspects present but not full accounted for. Blended is a blend of bland jokes and a tacky storyline."

I love that it has family elements and themes and that the two of them play a couple that never seems like they could get along and yet find they have so very much in common that can't deny it. It was entertaining and had some hilarious dialogue lines. I found it thoroughly amusing in every sense of the word. I know that Adam and Drew have only made three films together so far, but with how wildly successful 3-for-3 has been, I'd love to see more come from the two of them.10 huge shining stars! \u2728"
