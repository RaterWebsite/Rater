Dominion is a far cry from the Jurassic Parks that many of us grew up with. Owen and Claire\u2019s relationship is awkward at best and Alan and Ellie\u2019s relationship felt like fan service gone wrong. Dominion focuses on in-your-face action more than it\u2019s predecessors which makes it feel more like a generic action movie. Unfortunately the subtle visuals and sounds used to create moments of dread in past films is missing completely. The massive dinosaur fights even felt identical to fights from the past 5 films.Also, what\u2019s up with everyone being able to hold off dinosaurs by holding up their hand? Owen was only able to do this with the raptor he raised from birth. It makes no sense that any other characters can suddenly make the dinosaurs obey them. This choice removes any sense of risk and danger as we know the protagonists can use this magic hand trick to deal with most smaller dinos. At one point we see a Velociraptor show up (one of the most terrifying creatures from past film) and I didn\u2019t even feel worried for our protagonist because they can all take dinosaurs now. The only reason I\u2019m not rating this lower is because the short scenes showing mosques adapting to our world were really interesting.It\u2019s truly disappointing to see so much wasted potential with the combination of the new and old cast."

Totally implausible get aways from situations and dino-attax just took all the suspense/realism from this. Our protags were never, ever in any danger when their threats are simply written to be cartoonishly impotent. I mean a plane crash at 200-mph into snow/ice and our protags have no broken bones, no concussions, no scrapes or scratches even! Totally written by and for 10 year olds. And the ridiculous amount of close-ups on Bryce D H, is the director in love with her or what?! Jeebus. Anyway, such a disappointingly wasted opportunity."

The film-making tools used in this film show a knowledge of the curriculum, but just using every trick in the text-book does not a great film make. Sometimes restraint is required, and that is exactly what I wish this movie would have done, to lay off for a second or two to late me catch my breath. There were some great moments with Bryce Dallas Howard swimming through a pond covered in duckweed and Chris Pratt being chased not by motorbikes but by velociraptors in Malta in Bond-esque fashion. The Dinosaurs spring up every chance they get which is exciting at first but the novelty quickly wears off. A new live-action dinosaur appears every two minutes and packed in back to back like sardines and characters stare at them stunned like they were still seeing them for the first time. I know if it was me all I would be thinking, 'it's just another animatronic dinosaur, nothing to see here'. If the dinosaurs were fewer and further between when they came on screen their presence would be impactful however what can you do when you've let them all out. At the end of the day less is more and that's no less true with Jurassic World Dominion. It might leave you motion sick and queasy but it is a rollercoaster ride nonetheless. They stretched the formula as far as it could possibly go (and sometimes further) and I for one am relieved its all over. Time for some long earned rest for the franchise."

The story is a  snoozefest that's just so overstuffed yet boring at the same time. The whole Dinosaurs living with humans concept is NEVER truly explored either, which would've made for a unique tale. Furthermore, the acting is a total mixed bag, but the bad writing is doing the actors no favors. You know when the chief complaint of your previous movie (Fallen Kingdom) was the terrible script, you're supposed to find new scriptwriters right? Well, either the producers nor Universal seemed to understand this, as Dominion  sends the Jurassic series off with a big old pile of Dino dung."

This is a movie that hedges all of its promotional material \u2014 and its opening montage, to boot \u2014 on the central question posed by the conclusion of its predecessor; can dinosaurs and humans truly coexist? In that, you're expecting what? Probably a movie involving the characters at hand trying to grapple with dinosaurs in a civilized environment, right? Welp. What we do get is yet another movie featuring a cadre of characters traipsing around a failing wildlife sanctuary, followed by an ending montage that would have you believe the movie just answered the aforementioned question at hand, even though it really, truly hasn't in any way, shape or form. In fact, the central plot of this movie is split between two groups of characters \u2014 Chris Pratt's Owen Grady, Bryce Dallas Howard's Claire Dearing and Isabella Sermon's Maisie Lockwood, and then Sam Neill's Dr. Alan Grant, Laura Dern's Dr. Ellie Sattler and Jeff Goldblum's Dr. Ian Malcolm \u2014 leading to a wholly bifurcated feeling to things. These two narratives never really coalesce in a cohesive, natural or satisfying way. More importantly, the split time ends up betraying every character in the film with an ultimate lack of development. Add on some of the most confoundingly agitating retcons I've seen in a franchise film in quite some time and you get a real disappointment at the theater, dinosaur fights and legacy character appearances be damned."

      "text": "It pains me to say it, but I was bored...I wanted it to be over and thats something I never thought I would feel watching a Jurassic Park/World movie. What happened here? I found this very sad because this is currently the only series that portrays Dinosaurs in a somewhat of a realistic manner and they have managed to screw it up.The original Jurassic Park was and still is, such a wonderful piece of entertainment because their creators understood that the hook of Dinosaurs is the fact that we know that they were real, they existed, they were animals on earth. And thus, they portrayed them as realistic as possible, like animals suddenly brought back from extinction. The fact that they looked and acted so real, made as all look at them in awe just like the characters in the movie were looking at them. That was the hook, and it was all tied up nicely with a simple story that would explain to us logically how it all came to be with characters that would complement all the questions with their own curiosity.But now, Dinosaurs are taken from granted, so much so, that they are not even the main threat of the plot. I will say this...Despite liking the first Jurassic World, the moment they started to portray the Dinosaurs as characters (Like Blue the raptor), the moment they started to screw everything up. Like I said, this were animals and the interesting thing about them is that they were huge and probably dangerous given all their teeth...but when they start to characterize them or portray them as monsters (God, I hated those laser beam focused raptors) the moment you take away the sense of awe and respect that such creatures emanate.This is a movie that is more focused on the action and the big set pieces than anything else and it looses all direction. Getting to see the old cast was fun and they do everything admirably well, but the fact that they are here and this turned out to be such a derailment from the original movie makes me feel kind of disgusted.We all know that making Jurassic sequels is not easy, and that capturing the magic of the original is nearly impossible given that, that was the first one to ever show us the creatures with such detail...but this was not the way to go.I could probably write more and more paragraphs detailing why the movie is such a miss, given how the story is incredibly contrived, some characters are awful stupid and basic (the main villain), some of the performances are not very good and the complete lack of tension within it despite being a movie where Dinosaurs try to eat people -  yet, the biggest point I wanted to make was the complete lack of understanding of what made the original so compelling. It was, because it made us think and question \"what if, what if this creatures really came back, what would that feel like?\"...this movie doesn't do that, in fact Jurassic movies have long gone from trying to do that, and this is the one movie where it finally hit me to a point where I was completely disconnected from it. A shame."

While the first Jurassic Park was amazing for visuals, revolutionary for the technical aspects of making the film, and a cult film for brining dinosaurs to the silver screen, the rest of the franchise looked more and more as soulless crash grabs. Jurassic World Dominion has one redeeming factor: It doesn't want to be anything more than entertainment with plenty of action and some plotholes. No matter how stupid the film is they managed to deliver what they wanted to delivery, what they promised to deliver. They recognized how the original novel behind the Jurassic Park franchise doesn't make sense, how the author is a technophobe, and some of his novels speak about how he fails to understand even everyday technology, well known practices and his fear comes from lack of understanding. But you can't build several stories on lack of understanding without revealing those holes in the story. When te Jurassic World franchise decidedly wanted to look less realistic, and present us a dystopic scifi world, it gave them some freedom to justify some of the silly things. Now with the last entry into the series they can't explain how dinosaurs would spread so fast, how they would adapt to everything, how noone would have time to prepare... This looks horribly bad for most of the viewers. But once you understand this piece never wanted to be more than a mildly interesting action flick because that is the best they can do with source material, and if they decide to always accept plot holes, unrealistic elements for more fun, then all of these issues are natural. For people who want to treat the whole franchise seriously, and want to think about any part of this action flick, it is horrible. For me, it is just pointless. If you can't make good films about an IP, because the IP is bad, you shouldn't make any film about it. But of course this stupid movie is still profitable..."
