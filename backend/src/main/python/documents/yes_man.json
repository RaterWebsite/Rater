After it was over, I was thoroughly pleased. The jokes fresh and funny, the plot actually decent, and the love story a bit inspiring. Perhaps not worth a blu-ray purchase, but definitely worth a rental."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Ignore the miserable idiots who are giving it a zero. Yes Man is good fun for the festive season, with some great character roles that add to the story in the same way as Groundhog Day.

While there is nothing new in this film, it does have a bit of heart and sends a good message: Get off your ass and be positive about life.

He plays the same character in every film. Enough already as it's no longer funny. Grow up."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "I was expecting laughs with tears when I thought of Jim Carrey in a comedy movie, with the last few movies I watched of his being The Mask, Ace Ventura, and Cable Guy. He was great in the number 23 thriller too. This was a let down! I agree with the message of the story though - \"yes\" does open up a world of possibilities."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "an extreme below average movie. Not Jim carey at his best.

I think it could be funnier  but still my final score for \"YES MAN\" is 7/10"}, {"rating": "5", "text": "It was alright.... From the reviews I've read the biggest problem people have with it is that \"it's just another Jim Carrey movie.\" \"Same old same old\" And before I saw the movie I found no reason to fault that. I've liked most of his movies I've seen in the past, and I'd watch them again, so how could I go wrong? The problem lies in the fact that although it is another standard Jim Carrey movie... its not a very good one. The humor is rather predictable, and there are plenty of moments in the film where you just go, \"That wouldn't happen. That's stupid.\" And something about it reminded me more of Failure to Launch than Liar Liar. Really not the most impressive comedy on his resume. It's a typical Jim Carrey comedy, without the typical Jim Carey comedy."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Very funny movie. Me and my family all loved it and couldn't stop laughing. If you have a sense of humor go watch it."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This movie is highly underrated. This treasure is another \"Ground Hog Day\". The theme is more seriousness than what is given credit for. Wayne W. Dyer, in one of his books, mentions YES as a spiritual principle ( I believe it was in \"Power of Intention\") This is a kindly funny and entertaining movie with a philosophical theme that more people should follow - including myself."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Yes Man starts out as a typical Hollywood comedy; predictable and pretty badly written. But it evolves towards the end and the message of the film is actually pretty good. Jim Carrey was also surprisingly good in this movie. Although I really like him, he has done his share of mediocre comedies most part of his career."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Good funny movie. Had me and my family in stiches."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Awesome movie, there were long segments of time where I didn't stop laughing.

I would definitely see it again."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Likable but rather empty comedy. Very typical of Jim Carrey, but very much lacks originality. It's just a rehash of numerous of his earlier films. Zooey Deschanel is charming though."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "\"Yes Man\" resembles former NYC mayor Rudy Giuliani, both movie and man like to bring up 9/11, regardless of time or place, regardless of the context. The FBI think they might be terrorists: Carl(Jim Carrey) and Allison(Zooey Deschanel) fly to Lincoln, are nabbed in Lincoln, bringing their Jack Kerouac-like adventure to a crashing halt, and in the process, crashing the film. \"Yes Man\" isn't big enough for terrorism; it's just a modest romantic comedy about living life to the max, and more importantly, caving in to your impulses. The man who invites Carl to the seminar throws a brick into the bank's plate glass window. Instead of making the allusion to terrorists being the ultimate yes men as an obstacle for the couple to overcome, the film should have eschewed the tackiness that comes along with dredging up the fallen towers, and showed how saying \"yes\" all the time, slowly becomes a hazard to Carl's life, and for those who orbit it. \"Yes Man\" should have treated Carl's single-minded tendency to say \"no\", then \"yes\", as an outgrowth of OCD, or better still, manic-depression. Saying \"yes\" as a descent into madness, but that's too ambitious for a film like \"Yes Man\", whose populist sensibility makes allowances for Carl's period of answering in the negative, a result of his lingering feelings for the ex-wife. The scene in which Carl overcaffeinates himself with Red Bull, hints at what a more ambitious \"Yes Man\" would look like."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This movie was absolutely wonderful. I was laughing all the way through, and I couldn't agree more with the message."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Funny and slightly enlightening, but its message is a little late. Had this been released in the uptight 80's or even the 90's I'm sure it would have been a epic splash. Nonetheless, the blatant sexual overtones broke the upbeat and positive tune that it had going for it. I don't care what passes for mainstream humor, the whole sex with the elderly woman just disgusts me, as it should for the idiots who let it pass as PG-13."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "DIABOLICAL FILM. Jim Carrey ruined it big time, he always does. Probably loves men and all. Winky face."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "I knew every second of this movie within the first 5 minutes. Like baking bread, this thing never strayed from it's recipe. Seemed more like a self-help message extended into 1.5 excruciating hours."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "After seeing the previews I thought the movie would really suck like some of Carreys recent effort. Totally wrong! It's a really good movie with a good message. At this point in my life, I could relate to it quite a bit so, slightly biased but still an excellent movie. Also, this movie gained a point for the killer ending credits art! Watch it, it's worth your time!"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This was the best (funnyest) carrey movie ever. It wasnt a deep movie but it got good laughs."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This is a wonderful movie. I laughed all the way through. If movies with a heart mesage interect you this is great for you. SEND THE KIDS TO THIS ONE!"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "One of the funniest movies I ever seen."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This movie seems to be the hilarious, feel-good movie of the year. The movie is put together very well with no apparent holes in the plot and it has a perfect cast with each star playing his/her role excellently. Anyone who can give this movie a 0 isn't rating this movie and just doesn't like Jim Carrey."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Pretty enjoyable, you know what to expect from carrey, and frankly it is getting a bit old, but he's a class act in my book...."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Yes Man is a very hard film for me to review because it one of those films where the part of me that fancies myself a intellectual film critic tells me I should hate it, and the part of me that is just some suburbia kid that went to see a movie on Friday night tells me I should love it. The reason I"}, {"rating": "1", "text": "I walked out of this movie and I haven't done that in a very long time. I found it tiresome, not that funny (Carey's schtick is getting worn out). Only reason to give it a one was his co-star, Zoey. She's fresh and brought a bit of life to this dog."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I want to start by saying I don't \"go crazy\" fo Jim Carrey but I did like this film. I will admit my two favorite films of his are Liar Liar and Yes Man and though they are surprisingly similar they are still great films. I think Carrey can be genius and why can we not celebrate his genius we he repeats his genius? Harrison Ford plays the same guys in two of America's most popular sagas and we love him for it. If you do something well then do it. On another note I was totally annoyed at the sex scene with the elderly neighbor. That scene was absolutely not necessary. It made everyone uncomfortable. I don't think a \"Yes Man\" audience is going to think that is funny. I also believe that is a subconscious reason why a vast majority of critics didn't give it the \"it wasn't deep but it was funny card\". Because when you think back on watching the film there was something annoying in the film and it was that scene. It reminds me of \"Over her dead body\". There were some great lines in that film but it was really hard to get past Eva Longoria watching and commenting during love scenes. I just walked away saying yeah I don't need to see that again. Anyway....Yes Man made me laugh really hard in some scenes but it was totally ruined by one lame scene."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Cute. The wife and I enjoyed this more than we thought we would. Worth watching if you liked previous films of his like Liar Liar. Nothing too shockingly original (but then, you can always rewatch Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind), but worth the 90 minutes of you're life it'll take."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I agree with Rosa - if you have a sense of humor you probably loved this film (as I did). If you go to films looking for reasons to say no to a good laugh, then maybe you should pay attention to the message in this film!"}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Don't spend you hard earned money on this sappy crap."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Hey, it's not the best movie ever, nor the funniest comedy in recent memory, but it's entertaining from beginning to end. While there are more hearty chuckles than deep belly laughs, there are very few jokes that fall flat. Also very well done is the love story. The chemistry between the two actors is great, and very believable. All in all, this is a fun movie to see with friends or with a date, which I did last night, and found myself quite enjoying."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This movie had me laughing all the way through, it is a must see!"}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Not Jim Carrey's best. There was some funny moments but it wasn't a spectacular movie. Maybe worth watching once though."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "I thought it was a well round innocent fun comedy flick. Yes man has its up and downs and might be corny for most. Certainly not Jim Carreys best but I enjoyed it, had me laughing and also had a moving/calm side to it."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Three years after his divorce Carl Allen\u2019s life is going nowhere until, on the advice of a friend, he signs up for a self help program with one simple principle: Say yes to everything.\r Despite the fresh spin the basic plot (boy meets girls, ruins things and then redeems himself) has been seen countless times before and the movie certainly runs out of steam by its final scenes but, thanks in large part to an excellent cast that includes the likes of Zoey Deschanel, Bradley Cooper and Rhys Darby, Yes Man makes for an enjoyable comedy."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Nothing overly exciting. It does bring back a bunch of memories of liar liar but I felt like it fixed some of the issues with that movie, but it also makes a few problems. Saying yes to everything should have led to some more legal problems then this, but the supporting cast in this was better then liar liar. This is a cute movie that makes some good laughs but one that you don't need to see more then once."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I think this movie is so great. The story is very interesting. After finished watching, I become vigorous. It is worth the money to see it. The acting is so-so.
