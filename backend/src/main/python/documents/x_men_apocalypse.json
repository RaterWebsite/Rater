Colors are like from the disco or a 90s porn movie and stuff like Mortal Kombat costumes in Auschwitz are some kind of a sick joke.\r But the worst thing are the scenes which take place in Poland. I'm from Poland and I can assure you we have laughed out loud of those. Actors trying to build up the mood in foreign language look just silly and I'm sure that's not the kind of atmosphere you want on the screen when drama takes place!\r Also, the main villain is a mix of funny guy and some angry kid who can't even choose his companions wisely. But hey, he can do some mumbo jumbo with his hands and give some nice toys to his mates - so awesome.\r I must admit tho', that the movie has some cool characters and decent scenes (Quicksilver rulez) but that's all. I can't recommend more in this long and rather dull performance of actors lost in their roles. Waste of money."

How on earth do critics diss the well-done Warcraft movie and tolerate this one (though not saying much, because there's really nothing to praise here)?\r It's the old \"really bad guy from ancient times (Egypt) comes back and tries to take over the wooorld\" trope, with that really being just it. Only action scenes after one another make for puke-inspiring pacing and some really horrific \"few seconds of idyllic life, family gets killed, now Magneto is evil\" crap tropes filled over all the scenes they spared some dialogue on.\r Derp-faces all over.\r Singer should be ashamed.

      "text": "Apocalypse gives us the first X-Men movie to feature a classic lineup of the characters coming together in their teenage years to fight evil under the guidance on Prof. Xavier while not being overshadowed by Wolverine. Essentially it's a close as we've gotten to the X-Men film we've all wanted for years now. However given how many steps forward the superhero movie genre has taken over the years, and Brian Singer's reliance on standard tropes, Apocalypse ends up being an odd mixture of better late than never, and too little, too late.There's a lot to like about Apocalypse. We get the return of the great cast from First Class and DoFP like Fassbender and McAvoy, Sophie Turner's Jean Grey, Evan Peters continually enjoyable Quicksilver complete with more of those amazing super-speed action sequences, and it doesn't crap all over Cyclops. It's got some of the best portrayals of these X-Men characters we've seen onscreen so far. The interpretations still aren't perfect mind you. DoFP couldn't fix everything, so things like age and timeline discrepancies keep things from being just as every comic book fan wants to see it. Nothing short of a reboot of the series will fix that. However, this is still the best we've gotten so far in that department.Given that Apocalypse seemingly does so much right by making good on the promise DoFP set the series up for, what keeps it from achieving greatness? That answer is simply that it's too familiar. With the MCU dominating theatres, the DCEU getting up and running, and the X-Men's own lengthy presence on the silver screen we've seen a lot of villains want to destroy the world. And quite frankly, they were more interesting than Apocalypse.The movie just has a very bland villain. Plus we already know how the fight turns out, so Apocalypse just ends up coming off as some dude who isn't really a threat whose sole purpose is just to break stuff. Then there's how underdeveloped he is.The action itself falls short as well. This is a bunch of special effects driven destruction. The likes of which we've seen in a lot of superhero films lately. Not even the constant display and barrage of these character's powers carries the same level of excitement as before. The action still isn't boring to watch, but it's certainly going through the established motions. Then there's the fact that a lot of these special effects look cheap and dated, particularly in the first half of the movie.What hurts Apocalypse the most is simply superhero fatigue. Brain Singer and FOX do their best to give us the X-Men movie we should've received in the first place all those years ago. For the most part they succeed. The issue it's a little late to do that. The superhero genre has taken off and reached heights one could hardly believe. Going back to basics wounds them here. They got off to their post-DoFP timeline with a shaky start.Does any of this mean Apocalypse is an outright bad movie? No, it's just behind the times. A flaw that's easier to forgive when you consider this is a close as we've come to that perfect X-Men lineup. There's a sort of classic X-Men feel to it and it's just nice to see a lot of the original characters like Cyclops, Nightcrawler, and Storm get some real screen-time and actually take part in the action without Hugh Jackman's Wolverine hogging the spotlight. So yeah, it's the most admirable attempt at giving us the perfect X-Men movie that's sadly flawed in key areas. For some this simply isn't going to be enough. For others like myself this will still be a respectable and enjoyable movie. One that still manages to entertain for (finally!) exploring other, original X-Men. The series things to make up for, but it certainly looks like they're trying. The future still has the potential to be bright for these characters.7.4/10"

It's definitely worse than the prequels but not that awful either. Apocalypse turned out to be a disappointing villain (though I feel like Oscar Isaac did the best he could with the material given), plot was fairly weak, ugly cg floating rubbish and I still think the mystique makeup on Jennifer Lawrence looks terrible. But overall I quite enjoyed the movie: Magneto had a great arc, I liked the new young versions of the x-men and quicksilver is awesome as ever (plus a cool cameo of you know who).  Want to give it a 7.5, but since metacritic doesn't allow decimals in userratings I'll round it up to 8."

Hopefully this will be Singers last chance at this franchise and it will be handed to someone with a fresh vision because it is creatively and artistically finished. It looks like audiences are getting sick of this s*** too judging by the ever diminishing returns. This is possibly the worst of the bad bunch of X-Men movies. Terrible baddie, terrible heroes. Fassbender is destroying his rep by being in garbage like this and Assassins Creed. He's such a good actor though, such shame. Movies like this are going some way to killing the genre. Please let this franchise die after Logan.Moving forward I think Lord and Miller would make a good choice to re-boot X-Men. Burn everything that's been created so far to the ground and give them absolute creative control and we might be onto something."

      "text": "This movie never failed to make me laugh at the very thought of the situation it was displaying and the dialogue it chose utilise. Problem of course being that is not a comedy movie. I am a big fan of the X Men prequels specifically, but I just have trouble understanding the motivation for a lot of the decisions made in this film. Why is Moira completely clueless? Why is she the one who accidently starts the apocalypse? Why doesn't anybody bother to name Erik's wife? Why were Erik's wife and daughter there, if only to be killed and not brought up again past act 1?Somehow those decisions are not the worst part of Apocalypse. No, that definitely belongs to the category of decisions that have motivations, just either stupid or non storyline based ones. Ex: Moira being brought back into the story, which despite never being mentioned in Days of Future Past, was just because they needed to bring back Charles's obligatory female love interest. Why does Erik have a wife and child, if they don't even get a personality? Well, similarly, they just needed that sweet sweet domestically foiled character motivation. Why is Erik Peter's father? Gotta have that DRAMA. Why does Alex seemingly die? Maybe character motivation for Scott, though it didn't really seem like he needed any more. Stil I was having fun until one very particular decision was made in this movie:How Charles Xavier lost his hair. But we\u2019ll get back to that.Moira MacTaggart was a completely unnecessary part of this film. Wanna know what she does throughout it? Goes \u201cWow\u201d and \u201cthis is so cool\u201d. In First Class, she at least had a personality, and she felt NEEDED to an extent for the story. Why is she here? Well Were just kinda supposed to believe that Charles has actually been hung up on her for, what, 15 years? Despite never mentioning her in Days of Future Past. First Class itself seemed to realise how unnecessary their relationship would be, sending Moira off with a wiped memory as a way out. We see this complete lack of necessariness in the very DRAMATIC moment where Charles gives Moira her memory back of the two of them. Memory being singular. Why? Oh, cause, y\u2019know, they kissed one time. ONCE. For contrast, when Erik reminisces on his relationship with Charles, we are shown a whole two and half memories of them together, and the filmmakers don\u2019t depict THEM of being in a relationship! MAKE IT MAKE SENSE! Moira could have never come up again and I would not have cared, I feel like most people wouldn\u2019t have, but no, Charles needed that obligatory love interest, so we get Moira MacTaggart, who now has a child we\u2019ve never seen, and is amazed by literally everything, which don\u2019t even get me started on how THAT ruins the very bare bones of a character she had in First Class. Now I don't know if you know this, but Charles Xavier is bald in the non prequel films when he is old. Now any logical person would just (rightfully) assume he lost his hair naturally due to aging. But oh no, apparently the execs at Fox decided this was a fan theorised mystery that needed answers. \"HOW DID CHARLES LOSE HIS HAIR?' you may have seen no Reddit thread titled ever, y'know, cause no one cared. Well! Answers my good people! Charles lost his hair because an ancient entity tried to take over his body! This makes no sense and ultimately solidifies this movie as a knee slapping comedy. When we see Apocalypse take over Oscar Isaac's body in the beginning, he is bald, but he is bald BEFORE apocalypse. Can apocalypse not exist in a body with hair? Why? How could Charles keep his eyebrows and stubble? Where did the hair go, it didn't fall out, it seems to turn to dust like everything else Apocalypse used his power on, why? Does apocalypse really hate hair that much? Did the filmmakers not realise how Mr. Clean like James McAvoy would look bald? Like yeah he's been bald in other movies bald that doesn't make it a good idea. WHY? DID? THEY? MAKE? HIM? BALD?   Overall I had one take away: If I were any actor in this movie, I would be pissed. The performances are AMAZING, especially from James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, but it just can\u2019t save this piece of garbage. Whether this was an introduction or a long awaited conclusion of sorts, no one deserved to be given this piece of trash to work in, except definitely Bryan Singer. I would say this film being as terrible as it is is most likely in part karma from the gods for Bryan Singer, any other explanation can not offer enough grounds for making THIS BAD of a film."

The only somewhat intriguing parts include the opening chapter, the final team line-up and introduction of the Danger Room, as well as a speedster's spectacular feats.The most tragic event, Magneto's loss of his family, is cynically viewed as but a plot device to propel the story forward. And once again the horror of Ausschwitz is misappropriated by people who lack the intellectual ability to do anything enlightening with it.A movie such as this, one featuring a multitude of newly-introduced \"mutants\" and warring ideologies, could only ever have succeeded with tight plotting, an intelligent script and confident production design. It lacks in all three accounts. Kinberg is a hack writer. Singer's propensity for casting young aspiring male actors is all the more troubling in light of the allegations of sexual misconduct that surround him.The depiction of Arabs and Slavs is stereotypical, lacking in empathy, and all the more unfortunate seeing as how X-Men movies purport to deal with minority issues and xenophobia - though this cast of almost exclusively white heroes would suggest a white-washing of social issues, anyway.Even the actors acknowledge that they're in a dud by phoning it in. Find another actor or actrice who hates their trademark franchise as much as Jennifer Lawrence hates X-Men at this point. Oscar Isaac is unrecognisable as the main villain, and gives an uninspiring performance. Rose Byrne is completely wasted, unfortunately. The only motivated actors would seem to be James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, and Magneto's tragic life makes him far too deep a character for this frequently campy film.I lol'd hard at the sight of Wolverine's raggedy... jorts.The MCU reboot can't come soon enough."

The beginning was trying to weave together too many threads and none of them were particularly strong.  The special effects are kind of suspect and the title villain is by far the weakest part of the film.  William Stryker was a more interesting villain than Apocalypse in the film and he had about 2 minutes of screen time.\r The whole production was still a lot of fun though. The film started off weak, but as soon as you see Quicksilver, the film starts to perk up.  He is once again the best part of the film and balances out extremely uneven performances from some of my otherwise favorite actors like Oscar Issac and Michael Fassbender.  Quicksilver steals every scene he\u2019s in but they still keep him in balance with the other characters.  Sophie Turner also has terrific screen presence and I look forward to seeing this actress come into her own.\r Part of the reason I enjoyed the film was that it had just so many comic characters and nods to avid comic readers.  Yet, this both hurts and helps. Seeing Caliban on screen was pretty great, but the true to the comic outfit for Psylocke (Apocalypse too) made her look extremely out of place in every scene she was in.  While I like that they went for it, all of the other Horsemen get practical armor and she is just wearing the least practical thing available and it\u2019s just all you can look at every time she\u2019s on screen.\r I would recommend this movie if you\u2019re a fan of the film series and the comics, but otherwise I would stay away from it because it is going to be not only confusing, but what works about the movie probably will not work for you."

It's horrific.\r- They don't seem to understand the powers of the characters in the movie... even after establishing them. Nightcrawler can't go through a wire cage. No, he can't go \"through\" electrical current-areas now. It's... beyond unclear and doesn't make sense. He teleports, director, he doesn't \"go through\" things. That's why he can appear in *places he knows well without having to see it, you explained his powers in the movie yourself*. It's one thing to just change the way a character's powers work... it's another to go out of your way to explain how they work and then actively work against your own explanation.\r- People were upset, in the past, how poorly the Phoenix Saga was represented. Well, the director has listened to our complaints, and straight-up ignored them. Same thing's going on with Jean, she's just crazypants.\r- Writer 1: \"Darn, we ceded too much power to our villain and he has control of Prof. X... what do we do with the story now?\"\rWriter 2: \"Just magically give him the power to fight the villain out of nowhere for what is clearly no good reason except that we don't know where to go with this\".\rThen he's easily defeated, anyway, and that part of the fight is rendered not only non-nonsensical but pointless, as well.\r- Think Beast is a cool character? Meh, he's just some scientist for most of the movie, and is only beast near the end. Oh, the **** version, not an interesting version. Enjoy.\r- Wolverine shows up, and mostly kills some people off-camera before disappearing. One okay spot in the movie. Then he's gone.\r- Prof. X knows that he's teaching a kid, Cyclops, to use his powers and that uncontrollable, powerful lasers come out of his eyes. So they set up beside a pond and have him shoot at a target by a big tree. The tree is destroyed. Prof X puts the kid on a big guilt trip about how his great grandfather planted that tree and it was his favourite spot in all the world. **** you, Xavier, the kid had a blindfold on because of his laser eyes, and you set him up to shred your favourite thing, then blamed him.\r To hell with this movie. Again, this director has zero respect for the source material. No, really, I'm not making that up. He BANNED all comic books from the sets of the X-Men movies."

Parts have you emotional, some on the edge of your seat, and overall story and premise was good. You don't need to know or see all X-Men movies to like this one."

      "text": "Acts as a direct sequel from the ending of Days of Future Past, Singer continues the main themes of family, struggling to accept oneself and the challenge of letting go of the past in expanding this ambitious mutants universe, though slightly mess up but it is still a competent film. It starts off at a fine pacing with several pieces of subplots to reintroduce the old members, decently surface the villain but due to overloading of stories to tell, there's a lot of flaws especially at the final act as well as some underdeveloped new characters. The story still focuses on the three main characters - Xavier (Professor X), Erik (Magneto) and Raven (Mystique), all deliver promisingly just as previous installments that leads to a very engaging chemistry together with powerful scores by John Ottman, visually stunning effects and a number of fun moments delivered by both Professor X and Quicksilver (although the latter seems to steal the attention much better in two major scenes). The theme of hope might not be quite resonant this time and it might not be the best entry in the trilogy but overall it's more humanly emotional engaging and certainly one of the quite successful superhero trilogy reboot."

      "text": "X-men Apocalypse is a decent follow up to the events of First Class and Days of Future Past even if it doesn't quite reach the same bar as its predecessors. The film does take some time to get rolling but I felt invested in most of the characters that were on the screen. This is because First Class and Days of Future past did such a wonderful job of setting certain characters up. McAvoy and Fassbender reprise their roles as Professor X and Magneto. Their chemistry is still strong and a great source of emotional investment. Jennifer Lawrence returns as Raven (Mystique) along with other familiar faces like Beast, Havoc, and Quicksilver. Quicksilver once again has a wonderful scene and I would go so far as to say it may even be better than the one in DoFP.\r The villain Apocalypse is imposing and feels like a proper threat. To avoid spoilers, as the movie progresses the stakes are exponentially raised. His ensemble of disciples or 'four horsemen' so to speak are just kind of there and seem like they exist because the plot demands it. The only character of these four that receives any form of proper characterization is Fassbender's Magneto. The additions of characters like Angel, Psylocke and Storm feel a bit like they were thrown together in a hurry. Apparently there is another popular X-men character in the film that I completely missed.\r Nightcrawler along with Quicksilver add some nice moments of levity. This levity balances out the destruction that happens elsewhere in the film. The score and visual effects are quite nice as well.\r Apocalypse overall is a flawed but enjoyable film."

      "text": "The superhero genre is not over yet, with 'Deadpool' (2016) delivering all the goods, then came 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' (2016) which didn't live up to expectations, but were quickly turned around when 'Captain America: Civil War' (2016) promised us everything it can deliver.\r Fourth superhero movie in, and we are only just over half way there. 'X-Men: Apocalypse' is a dark, threatening, and sometimes deliberately paced story. The movie begins somewhere in Egypt where we see En Sabah Nur who used to rule Ancient Egypt, until he is betrayed by his worshippers, and they try to stop him, but his four loyal men die trying to preserve him.\r We cut to 1983, and it seems that the mutants we know as \"X-Men\" are still going their separate ways. We see that Erik aka \"Magneto\" (Michael Fassbender) is living a happy life with his partner and daughter. Charles aka \"Professor X\" (James McAvoy) is taking charge of his school for gifted mutants with Beast (Nicholas Hoult) also looking after the school.\r Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) is still looking for new mutants and comes across a teleporting mutant who goes by the name \"Nightcrawler\" (Kodi Smit-McPhee) who she takes to Charles' school. Havok (Lucas Till) is back as well, and is concerned for his younger brother Scott (Tye Sheridan) as he cannot control this dangerous laser beam that emerge from his open eyes. Havok decides its time that he goes to Charles' school where he can learn to control these powers. This is also where Scott meets Jean Grey (Sophie Turner), who is having trouble sleeping as she can see/predict the end of the world, which will be caused by Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac).\r There is a lot of this plot to talk about, but to avoid spoiling it, I'm just going to talk about the things that worked and the things that didn't work. What worked the most was the story, I found myself invested in the somewhat scary story of Apocalypse and how he plans on bringing the end of the world, along with his allies including; Magneto, Storm (Alexandra Shipp), Angel (Ben Hardy) and Psylocke (Olivia Munn). I also liked the more darker and violent tone of the movie, probably the darkest since 'X2: X-Men United' (2003), and it is a very trippy experience, especially towards the final battle at the end of the movie.\r Oscar Isaac is great as Apocalypse, he seems menacing, he blends in fully to the role, and when he screams, his voice is convincing enough to lead you to believe that he is truly Apocalypse.\r Evan Peters returns as Quicksilver, the fast and zippy mutant we all loved from 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' (2014), he has another scene stealing moment, and it's arguably better than from the previous movie.\r James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender also commit to their roles as Xavier and Magneto, you still believe their tested friendship, and the way that they seem so drifted apart because of the different things they go through, it's almost heartbreaking when you see what happens with Magneto.\r What didn't work would be the pacing, this is a very unevenly paced movie...but it isn't as disjointed as 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' (2016), nor does it use all of its characters to their full potential like 'Captain America: Civil War' (2016). There are some mutants, mostly Angel and Psylocke, who aren't seen as much, and they're not as fully fleshed out as I would have wanted them to be.\r The stand-out performance here is 'Game of Thrones' star Sophie Turner as Jean Grey...she commits 100% to her role, and she is definitely memorable in her performance.\r All in all, 'X-Men: Apocalypse' may not be 'X2: X-Men United' (2003) or 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' (2014), but it is definitely nowhere near the poor quality of 'X-Men: The Last Stand' (2006) and 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' (2009) (a movie I don't like to mention), and certainly nothing like the abysmal 'Fantastic Four' (2015) (a big mistake from Fox). Bryan Singer does what he can with this movie, and at least 70% of the time, he's succeeded. It's better than you would expect."

I didnt think it sucked as much as Civil war because this movie has a conclusion. And the players in the war for the world learn something from the experience. All and all, apocalypse couldve used much more character development, and much more work to its villain. Maybe its time for Bryan Singer to take a little break from the series."

      "text": "X Men: Apocalypse completely nails it in what I think is the best X-Men to date. That trailer blew me away and this was actually my most anticipated movie of the year. I was really scared because of the disappointing reviews and boy could I tell you, I absolutely loved nearly every single second of it. It's not a perfect movie but it really has a great script and action sequences. There were so many characters that were fantastic and just the idea of the mutants amazes me. I thought the villain, Apocalypse, was great in this film and he was intense at times. I personally thought the best scenes were either at Xavier's school or in the Egypt area. Man is 2016 rocking it with those superhero movies. The only thing I could say slightly negative about this film was the film length as it was a bit too long, just like any Marvel movie. If you loved X-Men:Days of Future Past (I didn't particularly love that film, but it was okay), then you should like this movie. Go see it and support it as my theater had less people watching this than Captain America: Civil Warm, yet still being nearly full. I really hope this film does well and I look forward to watching it again in DVD. (98/100)"

It felt nice having a villain other than Magneto as the central protagonist but with that said, I expected more from Apocalypse. Also, a few more minutes of his backstory would not have hurt the movie time wise at all. It was also a relief not having Wolverine as the focal point and rather reduced to a cameo/action scene. The acting from the cast is surely not Oscar worthy but they get the job done. All in all, if you're looking for an enjoyable movie with a decent story then check this out. But like I said, do not expect this to be the greatest comic book movie ever."

The story was cool, new characters were pretty evenly introduced, the sights and sounds were phenomenal, and there is a lot of room for the next installment in the series! The only problems I really felt were timing and pacing issues. There were times when the movie felt like it was throwing a lot at you in a small amount of time, but as it went on I felt everything was explained pretty well. Also, it was pretty nice knowing about the X-Men before seeing this movie, but I feel people that don't know too much about X-Men can enjoy this movie just as much as I did. If you like X-Men or comic book movies in general I highly recommend X-Men Apocalypse!"

I'm not a big comic book reader or anything like that , but I know Apolcalypse isn't 5\"5 feet tall. What Tom Cruise is playing this character ? To let the older actors go and get these younger actors was a terrible decision . This is probably another worst superhero movie made again in 2016"

      "text": "I must say that this movie is definitely fun to watch for core comic book fans, and fans of the X-Men cinematic universe. However, as a casual moviegoer, there lies quite a few problems, rendering it to mixed reviews and being the second lowest rated film (on Rotten Tomatoes) in the entire series. There weren't enough fights between the X-Men and Apocalypse, who again, sounded repetitive and boring most of the time. A lot of key X-Men themes were touched on and never explored again in the film. There was an obvious focus on the future of the X-Men series, rather than the Apocalypse they're facing now. It just didn't seem like the end of the world was near, and that is where my main problem lies with this movie. The inevitable comparisons to Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Captain America: Civil War places this movie right in the middle. Apocalypse definitely accomplished more than Batman v Superman but it didn't deliver as well as Civil War did. All in all, X-Men: Apocalypse is a must see movie.
