After a few weeks of trying to get hold of him, Willis left the famous line, \"I will chop off your legs, set fire to your house, and watch you drag...\" on Perry's answer machine. They thought it was so funny that they included it on the film."

That's one explanation. Others include the use of cloth for saris, kilts, and burial shrouds. Another uses it in the sense of cubic yards of concrete, and another from the length of a machine gun belt from a British Vickers machine gun. But no use has been traced to any time before about 1850."

That\u00b4s the reason why, \"The Whole Nine Yards\" is just a movie that tries to copy all the forced cliches of the Mob genre. If that\u00b4s the intention of director Lynn (to make a farce or a parody of the genre), the result is mediocre. As a comedy, this movie sucks. Contains all the pathetic cliches of the mobsters comedy, and, worst of all, doesn\u00b4t provoke any laugh or any smile; all looks tired, forced, with the kind of Matthew Perry comedy (slapstick and a lot of stupidity) and a really annoying accent from Roxanna Arquette. \"The Whole Nine Yards\" worth just for the macabre humor (Amanda Peet steals the show), but as a whole is just a few inches."
