  "description": "When a younger girl called Emily Rose dies, everyone puts blame on the exorcism which was performed on her by Father Moore prior to her death. The priest is arrested on suspicion of murder. The trial begins with lawyer Erin Bruner representing Moore, but it is not going to be easy, as no one wants to believe what Father Moore says is true.",

I'm a huge Laura Linney fan and thought she was fabulous. I was sucked in, and much more scared and shook up than I am by stupid grotesque slasher movies. This film avoids cheap exploitations to try to convey what actually happened, and I find that to be more unsettling. Go see it. It's interesting that the users' ratings are so much higher than the critics'."

      "text": "As much as I had hoped this story would captivate me, I simply never found the film adequately engaging. Most of the plot is conveyed through flashbacks that are distressingly deviant in tone and purpose from the present day scenes set in a courtroom. If the audience is meant to question the forces of evil that may exist in the world or is asked to feel sympathy and compassion for Emily's fate, we are never given a real sense of why any of this really matters. I fully dismiss all supernatural explanations, but I am still intrigued by the notion that there are people who don't. Emily Rose ultimately fails to meaningfully connect to its audience because the screenplay is never quite sure what it wants to do. Is it fright film? Is it allegory? Is it a tale of mental illness? Is it a tale of demonic possession? Is it a courtroom battle between reason and faith? Maybe the film is all of these things. Unfortunately all of these ambiguous angles eventually steal each other's thunder. The film is too cluttered with ideas, but the performances are no less than adequate. In any case, Emily Rose is a mixed bag. Proceed with caution!"

Emily Rose passes away during the exorcism the priest responsible for the exorcism is charged with multiple charges. In terms of being a court-room drama, its an effective film exploring both sides of the narrative convincingly. Jennifer Carpenter offers up an incredible performance as the doomed Emily Rose with fantastic performances from Laura Linney and Tom Wilkinson to boot. The movie offers some thrills, the scenes involving Emily and creepy mostly due to Carpenter's incredible performance."

There is no Emily Rose. There is, however, a story about Anneliesel Michel, which this horrible movie was based on, and believe me, is a far cry away from the truth."

      "text": "Since this dog-days box office smash does double duty as a demonic possession thriller AND would-be hot-button courtroom drama, it allows cowriter/director Scott Derrickson the admittedly unique if dubious distinction of having done TWO of the worst directing jobs of 2005! His handling of the trial scenes, in which attorneys Laura Linney and Campbell Scott face off over whether or not catholic priest Tom Wilkinson was negligent in ordering the failed exorcism of (and denying medicine to) a sweet, earnest but devil-infested girl (Jennifer Carpenter) who was eventually killed by whoever or whatever took over her body, is as lazy and perfunctory as a garden-variety 1975 ABC-TV Movie of the Week at best...which still makes it preferable to his fraudulent and endless use of P. T. Barnum-like gimmicks in the allegedly scary flashback sequences. At least legendary schlockmeister/showman William Castle was ambitious enough in his day to jerry-rig entire movie theaters showing his stuff; whenever Derrickson wants to get an unearned rise out of his audience, he simply turns the sound up to 11, and running faucets, doorknobs and Fluffy the cat become objects of phony terror. (I mean, if the mere presence of loud, sudden noises is normally indicative that the minions of darkness are present, then shouldn't anyone living down the street from a bowling alley call Ghostbusters?) I've always found William Friedkin's film that started all this, The Exorcist, to be one of the most ridiculously overrated horror films of all time largely because it doesn't really immerse its audience in the situation beyond the blasphemous grossouts; whenever I've viewed it in theaters, many of the viewers only paid attention during the sensationalistic pea-soup-vomit/ use-a-crucifix-for-a-nonworshipful-purpose / kick-the-priest-in-a-place- that-ensures-he'll-never-be-a-father-should-he-change- his-mind-about-his-calling sequences; during the talky scenes, they often talk too. The Exorcism of Emily Rose has the exact opposite problem; the trial, as uninterestingly as it's filmed, at least brings up a few potentially provocative questions: how responsible is a man of God in a Christian country when his actions, sincerely believed to be God's will, go disastrously wrong? When do medicine and religion get to work hand and hand and when must they of necessity be at odds with one another? Can an agnostic believe in the possibility of good and evil supernatural forces and still be an agnostic? Does revealing the preence and methods of the Devil truly glorify God or put undue emphasis on His enemy? Sadly, every time Derrickson threatens to deal with one or more of these questions, he nervously reverts to the trite, third-rate boogedy-boogedy-boogedy once again. He also fails his wonderful actors, who are certainly capable of rich, multishaded characterizations, but you couldn't prove it here; smug, supercilious Scott, gruff-but-principled Wilkinson, and doubtful-but-compassionate Linney are all drawn with the thickest of crayons. Ultimately, it's Jennifer Carpenter in the title role who suffers the most, however; her endless possession scenes are technically skillful to be sure, but only once do we get a brief glimpse of what Emily was like before being taken over, and as a result Derrickson robs both Carpenter of the chance to prove that she's an actress of any more range than Linda Blair, and us of the opportunity to truly experience her tragedy since we don't get a real chance to know what she could've been. Actually Derrickson's approach reminded me not so much of The Exorcist as of another notorious 1970s box office hit, the el cheapo psuedodocumentary In Search of Noah's Ark, which packed movie houses (for a week, anyway) by promising to reveal where the ark was hidden, then completely copping out. The Exorcism of Emily Rose's $30 million opening weekend gross seems to indicate that Sony Pictures has the same ability to pack in the herds as Sunn Classic once did, but my question is, how did they also con so many distinguished Academy award nominees to also sign on for this exploitative drivel?"

Alas, it was more of a comedy than a horror flick. Some great talent (Linney, Wilkinson, even Carpenter) did the best they could, but instead of letting us share in the potentially terrifying uncertainty supposed to develop in the mind of defense attorney Erin Bruner (Linney) we are left to little screams of \"boo!\" at predictable places along the way. The \"real life\" story gets lost in a fictitous world where dormitories and jails are incredibly poorly lit (how convenient) and where on character scared in the dark bothers to turn on a single light. Instead of considering the plausabilities, as Bruner does in her closing arguments, the team that put this yawn together resorts to parlor tricks. What could have been a psychological thriller primarily because of its tie to a true story ends up a boring laughable cliche of a movie."

When I watched it in in a fully packed theater, I saw quite a few people just get up and leave right in the middle of it. This is because the marketing of this film was very misleading. After all of the hype, I was under the impression that this was going to be a straight up horror movie, and with the word \"exorcism\" in the title, it just automatically conjures up images of that other \"exorcist\" film which was truly scary. Yet instead what you get is a very well acted court room drama, with just a dab of demonic possession. Yet despite the lack of creepy visceral blood and guts moments, this is still a pretty good film. This is because it is more of a thinking person's film, which invites the audience to come to their own conclusions about some of life's greatest mysteries. Does God exist? Is there a hereafter? Those who left the theater early tonight were uanable to recognize these inferences, or to impatient to care. I found this movie very thought provoking, but I am also feeling mislead and cheated becuase it didn't give me of what I realy wanted, which is a film that is truly horrific. Unfortunately, the best horror images can be seen in the trailer of this film, but I found the intellectual aspect worth the price of my ticket. It wasn't as good as \"The Ring\", but it was waaaaay better than \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\"."

      "text": "This movie draws you in and doesnt let go. As far as the one reviewer who stated that \"why would the lawyer risk her career?...because she risked her career to represent the truth. At first, the lawery was trying to climb the career ladder at her firm, but by the end, she sincerely believes her client, she doesnt convert(she is an agnostic), but she does believe in the facts of the case, and that there is reasonable doubt to let her client off. She does have alot of pressure, and there is a inner conflict between her professional and personal, integrity, but that is just one of the engaging subplots that makes this movie so interesting. The path it takes to get her to make the profound decision to risk her career, as well as the story of Emily Rose, is horrifically, yet emotionally and intellectually, engaging. It goes from demonic possession to exorcism, and back and forth to the court room. If you like The Passion, Star Wars, Red Eye, Batman Begins, or the Fantastic Four, you will enjoy this movie. You know the same professional critics who give this movie low ratings have given so many good movies low ratings lately, that it amazes me that anyone sees them at all. The Passion and the Fantastic Four are classic examples of drastically low rated & reviewed movies, and yet they (and even a good amount of reviews for Batman Begins, Star wars, & War of the Worlds were unfairly very low) are some of the most viewed & enjoyable movies in the last 4 years. Since I am a member of the viewing public, and not the elitist \"professional \" reviewers club, I say check out this movie for yourself. I saw this movie late show Saturday night, and the theatre was somewhat rowdy/talkative in the first 1/2 hour, it was a fairly young crowd, but by the end of this movie you could hear a pin drop. This was a very well acted and produced movie and by the end you felt for the characters. You realized what an inner struggle they all went thru to arrive at the not so beautiful conclusion. Film did not have as much CGI as you would think. It was used where it was necessary, and not just for \"special effects.\" There were great uses of color, shadows, and lighting. Also, all the characters roles, even the minor ones, played an integral part to the story plot. No filler, all thriller...enjoy without any reservations."

At a cocktail party, you can imagine other lawyers whispering to each other, \"That's the lawyer who believes in demonic possessions.\" When Erin plays the tape recording of Emily's exorcism, we cut away from the courtroom and see the event being played out for ourselves. For some unknown reason, there are no reaction shots of the people in that courtroom. Emily's howls are a lot scarier as audio on a tape recorder than seeing Jennifer Carpenter make Runaway Bride eyes. We need to see the jury being convinced of Father Moore's innocence or guilt. \"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\" mainly doesn't work because we're so distanced from the titular character we're supposed to care about.
