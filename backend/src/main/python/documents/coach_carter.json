      "text": "\"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine as children do. It's not just in some of us; it is in everyone. And as we let our own lights shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.\" - Timo Cruz\r That's a movie, really. It's one of the most moving films I've seen. This movie really worth seeing. Samuel L Jackson plays the role very well."

      "text": "The movie was excellent. I found it so motivating that I went to his website and ordered a book. It's been almost 4 months and I have yet to see a book. I'm very dissappointed with this whole experience. It's hard to have faith in people when situations like this occure. I truly felt coach carter was genuine and had a great love for helping our children have a better understanding of the importance to do well in school. I hope this isn't business as usual."

      "text": "Coach Carter understands a lot of early-2000s cultural intricacies which other films of the genre struggle to capture, but the relatively simple characters don't always sell it correctly. Still, the movie tells a rich-enough story in a heartfelt, energetic way, which makes rooting for  Coach easy. Samuel L. Jackson plays Coach in a layered performance which sells his sometimes questionable actions well."
