      "text": "Intelligent, almost intellectual with all the literary references yet very emotional, erudite and totally accessible at the same time, bursting with life while filmed almost exclusively in stuffy enclosed locations, this film is a testament to the humanistic genius of mainstream American cinema (Better years of our lives, Night of the hunter) when cinema was still tethered to theatre. Maybe the cinematography isn't avant-garde but it doesn't count: This is acting at its finest. It's filmed theatre, and that is fantastic in itself.This movie should be watched in classrooms along the ones mentioned above."

And Marilyn Monroe shows up for a few minutes of eye candy. Yay.  A little more editing and tightening of the more draggy scenes, would've boosted my rating higher"

      "text": "Bette Davis as the acclaimed theatre star, Margo Channing, who is befriended by the film's protagonist Eve Harrington, a simple devoted fan of Channing, played by Anne Baxter.  Davis and Baxter turn in high quality performances in this tale of intrigue as we watch the layers of the two characters fall away throughout the film."

      "text": "that happens to be your practical abnormality..All About EveDespite of being termed \"All About Eve\", its barely about Eve and I mean it in as an undercooked character way that never reaches its destination until the last act and when it does it seems like makers jumped or skipped some beats. Joseph L. Mankiewicz; the screen writer and director has done some appreciative work but his sheer effort to create this character driven feature with a wafer thin script shatters the feature into bits and pieces of some good material that fails to make a definite point or even bind it all. Bette Davis is the actual winner in here that is supported amazingly by George Sanders but unfortunately one of the lead actors Anne Baxter's performance is what itches all the way through. All About Eve is your slow pill that is definitely effective in its own way but when it does, the question starts to beg whether all of it was worth or not."

      "text": "All About Eve is my idea of a perfect film,(and I am 17) beautiful and brooding at the same time. People consider this as one of the finest films ever made, and I cannot disagree. This and Shawshank Redemption are actually films that deserve to be in the top 250. The black and white cinematography is gorgeous, and the script is sharp and focused with great lines such as \"Fasten your seat belts, it's going to be a bumpy night\". The direction is excellent, and this is further advantaged by a terrific cast, a very good subject matter and sumptuous costumes. I couldn't help being captivated by Bette Davis's performance as Margo Channing, her presence in the film is actually the film's main merit. Davis was an incredible actress, and while not exactly pretty compared to Maaureen O'Hara and Rita Hayworth and not very easy to work with at times, she always brought a sense of command to all her roles, especially in this film. I still think that All About Eve is her best film, I honestly do, and she is well supported by a terrific supporting cast with the likes of the idealistic Anne Baxter and the suave George Sanders. All in all, a beautiful film, that is a must-see, if you haven't seen it already. It is quite long, but it is well worth watching for Davis's performance. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

      "text": "A story about rise-to-prominence of an ambitious young woman, who happens to be an immigrant. Great storytelling: the narrative is told by Addison and Karen and adopts a flashback. I especially admire the role that Bette Davis stars, who, always smoking, is so bold, charitable, humorous and sexy. Some notable details: the continual change of Eve's dress, which may reveal her lesbian sexuality, the indifferent scoffing expression of Margo and Karen in the beginning scene and the scene we know Eve has been lying through her stiff shadows. The surprising yet totally sense-making end elevates this picture to another level."
