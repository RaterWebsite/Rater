However, why not a 9 or a 10 then? Well, it probably doesn't help that I'm not the biggest fan of sci-fi blockbusters and to some people the chase sequence near the end is the best part but for me it goes on a little to long. Although vader is a classic image I don't think he is enough of an enigma. A shout out to Harrison Ford though,a great performance."

The musical score was absolutely amazing, John Williams is a great composer who added a lot to many great Hollywood films. The main characters were all great actors and actresses. (only the minor characters sucked \"look sir droids!\", etc. lol). The movie even accidentally spawned an amazing line of toys too! This film was epic and very few come to mind when I try to think of movies as epic that have been released since then."

      "text": "Yes, this is a good movie, but not QUITE the classic I'd always been conditioned to expect. (That honour I reserve for 'The Empire Strikes Back'.) While the action is pretty thrilling, it also takes a while to get off the ground (no pun intended), which may have something to do with how heavy it is on the exposition, especially with the opening crawl. (Even if the movie was being funded by a then-dying studio, that's no excuse to disregard that old rule 'show, don't tell'.)\r Having said that, I can see why this flick is so beloved. There's going into space, two protagonists who are more like us than we want to admit, and of course, what nearly everyone wants to do: saving the world. It looks really good, especially for 1977, though seeing as I had to watch the remastered version, the CGI sticks out pretty clearly.\r It's worth your time to watch it, just a bit less so than its first sequel and later works like 'The Matrix' and 'Serenity'."

All the characters are likeable and you care for these characters too. The action was great in the movie. Han solo and Chewbacca brings all the laughs to the movie. The chemistry between obi wan and Luke was so good. The movie explores well the universe. The score of the movie is one of the best things which made the movie great. The only issue I had with the movie was the last fight between obi wan and Darth Vader wasn't impacting.\r In the end star wars is a must see movie for all generation and your going to have a blast with it."

They are all effective at what they do and are people I\u2019ve become invested in, the story is effectively based starting out exciting then slowing down and gradually speeding up constantly keeping the plot moving while slowly revealing information about the world as we need to know it.  I feel like a lot of the love for this movie is nostalgia as again there\u2019s nothing too deep about it and the film is a tad cheesy. There is one thing that holds up about Star Wars and even now blows me away and that\u2019s the visuals. The visual spectacle is strong with this one. The costumes, score, and action all a wonder to look at as its become iconic for a reason. Star Wars is a fun movie but the particularly effective presentation combined with tons of nostalgia make it an enjoyable movie that I\u2019m always willing to back to. It\u2019s good to remember going into The Force Awakens that Star Wars was a fun movie with a lot of visual spectacle and didn\u2019t have a deep story. While nostalgia may win allow this classic to win out in the end it makes me reason that even if the new movie is good that doesn\u2019t mean that it failed because at the end of the day the original was a fun movie with presentation being an especial highlight."

More characters that help out include Han Solo (Harrison Ford), his Wookiee Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and two droids, C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker).\r What writer and director George Lucas has created is a fantasy world of his own, and it became one of the most legendary, and culturally significant pieces of motion picture ever.
