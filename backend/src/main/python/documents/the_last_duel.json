I say that because this film shows you exactly how brutal things were for women during that period(not just the 1300s, but all the way up to less than a century ago). The film is a display of how men were superior in that era and women were property; viewed lesser than men themselves. A time when silence was the only answer to most of women\u2019s issues. NOTE: This film is NOT some SJW propaganda or about dogging men. I hope my review does not come off that way.

Yesterday as today Ridley Scott does not conceal the senseless character of the duel. Nothing is more vain and foolish ...  [These] medieval squires are no less absurd\". Why write such a nonsense? In the film with which Ridley Scott made his debut in 1977, Carradine is persecuted by the obsessive belligerence of Keitel, Napoleon's alter ego. Unlike this last work, back then there were a hero and an anti-hero. Now, however, within a context of Shakespearean tragedy there is the heroine who, following the tradition of Ripley, Pris, Thelma and Louise, G.I.Jane, breaks the perspective equivalence of Kurosawa's \"Rashomon\" and, as a female figure, is the holder and depositary of The Truth (sic).

In my opinion, the film doesn't give a definitive answer to what is an undeniable truth, at least in regards to certain aspects (I'm not refering to the main question of guilt, that one is obvious). It does show that every person sees himself/herself as the hero of the story and that is what I liked about it. I thought performances were great. It was great seeing Ridley Scott do medieval stuff.

It flat out tells us, everything you just saw was false. Now for the real story. So everything you had come to understand about the characters was now deemed false. In this TRUE final 1/3rd of the movie, you discover that every man in the movie is pure evil. Matt Damon is pure evil - he rapes his wife more than Adam Driver, even raping her after she has told him she was raped. The more interesting character we had come to know - the uneducated war hero who tried to be a good husband - did not exist. Just a purely evil character. Adam Driver's character too was pure evil. It wasn't a consensual affair that turned into obsession that turned into a rape that the man convinced himself was consensual but deep-down knew was not - no, it was just a straight violent rape by a man of pure evil who enjoyed torturing the woman.Other women in the movie laugh about hoping their husbands die in war. Their husbands are all pathetic, none of them know how to have sex, good riddance if they all die. Other male characters are also straight garbage. Ben Affleck is an evil man who has orgies with sex slaves and his wife hates everything about him.The movie ends with Matt Damon dying in the Crusades and his wife lives happily without him. The movie tells us she never re-married, implying that's why she was happy.So the message appears to be: Men are inherently evil. Women are inherently good. Men and women should not be together (therefore the human race should end.) Believe women. Don't believe men.Ridley Scott said that Millennials didn't watch this because they don't want to \"learn\" anything.

The obvious reason (in the historical record, I assume) for raping another man's wife is to demean and insult him.  This is esp. so if he's your enemy.

The rapist (a man of honor to some extent) apparently believes the wife 'loves' him -- courtly love conventions notwithstanding, this makes no sense to me."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "This is an extremely disappointing outing from Ridley Scott. The set pieces, cinematography, and general aesthetic would all necessarily be great, save for Matt Damon's redneck mullet and Ben Affleck's platinum blonde, 90's boy-band haircut, both looks fitting to the awkward, silly acting portrayed by two American Hollywood stars forcing antiquated French antagonists. Adam Driver and Jodie Comer do much better, offering complexity in their performances despite restrictive and blindingly singular dialogue.The writing and plot lack all subtlety, outright prescribing fictionalized guilt in the central conflict of the story halfway through the film and tossing out any remote flirtation with moral ambiguity and nuance, two elements that thoroughly pervade the actual circumstances surrounding the real-life 14th century case of the rape of Marguerite de Carrouges, and which would have made the film a thousand times better.The effect of a multiple-perspective storytelling technique is rendered entirely moot by a text transition screen which literally denotes one perspective, Marguerite's, as \"the truth,\" ironically the single perspective which has the least basis in reality or history, being entirely fictionalized given the lack of a single spoken word or recorded account from Marguerite in the entire real-life case. Worst of all, in an overzealous attempt to decry toxic masculinity and rape culture in a way that resonates with modern #metoo audiences, the writers alter real medieval judicial systems and gender norms and invent make believe ones (i.e. every single scene invoking \"rape and pleasure\" dialogue) to unnecessarily make those already-harsh times seem far worse and far more uncomfortable in every way. Does any normal, healthy human being want to watch the same long, traumatizing, minutely detailed, over-dramatic rape scene multiple times in the course of a single film? The idea that medieval times were bad for men, worse for women, does not need to be ham-fisted into a film through factual inaccuracies and a visual-auditory simulation of PTSD.This is a film designed to evoke disgust and anger, not thoughtfulness and conversation. Every male character with any semblance of power is flawed and evil scum, abusing and oppressing every female, regardless of status (save for one internalized-misogynistic step-mother), who are perfect, flawless, and submissive victims. This singularly dystopian vision of the feminist nightmare has, fortunately for reality, never existed. In an utter and cowardly acquiescence to the socio-politico climate of modern Hollywood and an abject disdain for actual history and the culture of Medieval Europe, Damon, Affleck, Nicole Holofcener, and Ridley deliver an entirely modern tale with a distastefully masqueraded 14th-century backdrop that demonizes every man and victimizes every woman."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Visceral and timely.

'The Last Duel' may very well be his best film since 'Gladiator.'Don't let the runtime frighten you. Yes, it's long, but I don't think of another way it would've worked. Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and Nicole Holofcener's screenplay give us three distinct perspectives about a terrible incident: the raping of a woman. It's not hard to guess which version it's the truth, I mean, the film is very obvious about it, but it's the details that make this approach interesting.Each side of the story portrays different versions of the main characters, depending on whose turn is. \"The truth doesn't matter\", tells Carrouge's mother to Lady Marguerite (Jodie Comer) towards the end. And, yes, it didn't matter until very recently. With this film, everyone involved points at the patriarchal system that has held women hostage for so long. Of course, we're still a long way to go to change it, and 'The Last Duel' is not very optimistic about it, but there's light at the end of the tunnel; a moment in history when the victim's truth will be that: the truth.The weakest part of the film is Damon and Affleck's acting, which goes from funny to over-the-top and back all the time. Adam Driver is fine (not great), but it's Jodie Comer who saves the day with the vulnerability and stoicism she gives to her character. There are also some issues with the editing; a lot of scenes end pretty fast, taking you out of the action or the drama. The dialogues are bad sometimes, especially those of the male characters. And, of course, Damon and Affleck's characterization is wild, almost funny.But, despite these problems, the ending is very satisfying. The actual last duel is brutal and spectacular. Reminded me a lot of those Coliseum scenes in 'Gladiator.'Go see this film on a big screen!"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "In this medieval drama from director Ridley Scott, set in 14th century France, Matt Damon stars as knight Jean De Carrouges, who challenges his squire Jacques Le Gris (Adam Driver) to a duel to the death after De Carrouges' wife, Lady Marguerite (Jodie Comer) accuses Le Gris of raping her. The story is uniquely separated into three chapters and is told through the points of view of each of the three aforementioned characters, depicting each of their versions of how the events unfolded. Of course, Ridley Scott is no stranger to making historical epics, what with stellar films like 'Gladiator' and 'Kingdom of Heaven' under his belt. He always seems to be genuinely fascinated by history or whatever time period he's depicting in each of his films, and this film is certainly no exception. The attention to detail, the set pieces, and costumes all transport us to this gritty and dark ancient time quite effectively. Each of the three chapters are engaging and intriguing. Scott essentially borrows a page from the 'Me Too' movement and shows what it's like for powerless women to suffer at the hands of powerful men who go on to deny any wrongdoings and sets it in a far more ancient time, wielding fascinating and poignant results. On top of that, we're graced with harrowing and intense performances from all involved. Damon is fierce and committed, as is Driver who brings a similar level of sinister that we've seen in his villainous turn as Kylo Ren in 'Star Wars' but adds even more depth and layers here. It was also great seeing Ben Affleck reunite with Damon here at long last, and he too gives a rather playful and humorous performance as Count Pierre d'Alencon. However, the real MVP here is without a doubt Jodie Comer, who commands the screen with an equal amount of rawness, heartbreak, and resilience all at once. She's incredible here, and more than holds her own against the rest of the Hollywood heavyweight men of the film! At two and a half hours long, and repeating some scenes due to the three different perspectives, the film doesn't necessarily drag, does take its time with building up certain elements and aspects of the film, but manages to remain quite captivating nonetheless. Overall, it's an epic and worthy addition to Scott's mighty filmography, a bold showcase for all involved in the cast, and a welcome, unique, and thought-provoking look at sexual misconduct and misdeeds through a historical lens for a change."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Great film.

Each version has some absolutely solid truths they all agree upon, and some subtle, and not so subtle, differences based on who's telling it. I loved that in both pics and Scott pays appropriate homage to the Kurosawa's masterpiece.I thoroughly enjoyed this and everyone in it. My only minor complaint is the bit of wokeness around Jodie Comer's version, which leaned heavily into the narrative that women had little power in the 14th century...der. I think that's well-trod ground, and at the end of the day, she didn't have to fight a dude who had seen a **** ton of combat like her husband did. Sure, the actual action doesn't take place until the third act, but even with its brevity, the duel itself is a great piece of action cinema a la Scott and a well-earned payoff.

It\u2019s a compelling story and hugely tense as the movie builds to its inevitable climax. My main issue with The Last Duel is the three separate narratives and the need for them. Due to this you\u2019re seeing many of the same scenes again from a different perspective and I don\u2019t think the audience needed to see a brutal rape scene twice.

Even with all its flaws, but it's for that very reason that it will hardly appeal to audiences looking for a more basic entertainment.And it's not that I want to minimize other people's tastes but a period film, with performances that border on the operatic, with a gray and cold staging that does not really involve much action and lasts two and a half hours, will hardly be attractive for the masses.I recommend it because I didn't think it was a bad film, but I also have to admit that it added absolutely nothing to Scott's r\u00e9sum\u00e9, and it doesn't have to.

It is a game with how one's own perception can deviate very massively or even very slightly from the perception of the other person.A film that is shot very cold and somber and partly in its rather few action sequences it is full of it and can be uncomfortable. At the beginning the film needs some time to get going, but then it even turns into comedy at times. But if you internalize the narrative structure, the tide turns and the tension increases more and more and finds its climax in the story of Marguerite de Carrouges, played incredibly well by Jodie Comer. But the rest of the cast is also strong with the outstanding Adam Driver (I've become a real fan of his), Matt Damon and Ben Affleck.For me it's a great film that ends in a brilliant finale and only has some starting problems 9/10 perspectives."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "A very interesting experience. Watching the story through the eyes of each of the main characters is truly interesting. I advise fans of interesting stories. Acting is on top. Ridley Scott did a great job, he made a great movie!"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Huzzah and greetings, Streamers! A new weekend has brought the latest Ridley Scott historical epic, The Last Duel, to theaters. This unexpected offering has more than just the titular duel. The film depicts the power differential between men and women in 1300's France as well as how those issues continue to permeate modern times. Here's how it goes.Based on true events, The Last Duel tells the story of Knight Jean de Carrouges (Matt Damon), the Knight's wife, Marguerite (Jodie Comer), and his squire Jacques Le Gris (Adam Driver). Essentially, Knight Jean de Carrouges challenges his squire, Jacques Le Gris, to a duel in order to defend his wife's honor, as she has accused Le Gris of assaulting her. Damon and Ben Affleck co-star in the film and co-wrote the screenplay with writer/director, Nicole Holofcener. The story is recounted from the different perspectives of de Carrouges, Le Gris and Marguerite in order to illuminate their differences and to emphasize Marguerite's truth. In this way, the action of the film centers upon the drama of what led up to the \"last duel\" and not so much on the duel itself.Ridley Scott has directed historical epics before like Gladiator, Kingdom of Heaven and Robin Hood. But, The Last Duel has a deeper importance considering that it's based on true events and it reflects the little progress our society has made in dealing with sexual assault. Scott does a good job with the action aspects of the film. Some of the more dramatic elements can get kind of hokey. The story is told in relatively equal thirds, from different perspectives with clever alterations to each version. However, there is a repetitive nature that affects the overall pacing of the film, which can feel long in the middle. Thankfully, the film perks up when Marguerite takes center stage. As a side note: the movie looks good in terms of setting, production design and cinematography - it's believably France in 1386.Jodie Comer is great in this. Really, Marguerite is a really good role, and Comer lives up to it. Marguerite has to be demure to her husband, enticing to Le Gris, and steadfast and self-possessed in her own version. Comer does such a good job of embodying each version of Marguerite that the truth of the story is apparent when she steps into her own story. The Last Duel ends on such a high because of Comer's powerful performance. The rest of the cast is fine, but they suffer from wonky accents and unsatisfactory dialogue. At points, the dialogue is too on-the-nose; it's as if Damon and Affleck lifted a Facebook argument and plopped into a scene in France 1300's. The point is well-made, but not necessarily well-executed.Final note: when the duel does occur, it is exciting and tense. I'll give credit to Scott's great direction of the fight. Both Damon and Driver are totally invested in the brutality of it all. You can absolutely understand why other duels weren't sanctioned by the king after this. Lastly, again, Comer, in the duel scene, is remarkable and it wouldn't not be as emotional without her performance.Ultimately, The Last Duel does a good job of telling a story from France 1300's that is relevant today. While telling the story from three perspectives isn't always successful, the attempt to illuminate the differences is admirable. The powerful performance by Jodie Comer makes it all worthwhile in the end. If you're looking for a swashbuckling, heart-pounding fight to the death epic, this isn't that thing, so don't be fooled. For what it is, I'll say it's a bowl of popcorn at a Sunday matinee."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "such an amazing movie! i enjoyed it.
