JOBS, is the biography/film recreation of Steve Jobs' (Ashton Kutcher) life. Being founder of Apple, we follow him and Steve Wozniak (Josh Gad), as they create the company and watch it flourish. The film starts in 2001 (picture two) as Steve introduces the first iPod, and then it jumps back to mid 70's when the company first started. Starting the company in his parent\u2019s garage with the other Steve, we follow him through his hard work in Apple. We could tell that Steve really was a jerk after starting his company, but we also saw how he cared about his good friends and about the association.\r The movie really gave me an understanding on how his life changed the world. I learned that words did not affect Steve; he never gave up with hundreds of people hanging up on his phone pitches, and in live demos. The film JOBS really showed how great of an actor Kutcher is. Throughout the film, I was convinced that he was Steve Jobs. He had got everything right even down to the walk Steve actually carried.\r Being an Apple fan, I really enjoyed JOBS. I think that any viewer would enjoy the film, but I feel like the movie will only attract people who care about the history of Apple. It's more of a selective audience for this film, because there is no point in seeing it if you are not an Apple fanatic. I think Josh Gad also did a great job as Wozniak, and I still think he and Jonah Hill have the same voice.\r Even in the 130 minutes the film ran, JOBS did not cover the last decade of his life when Apple really took off. Sequel, maybe? I wasn't sure if Open Road Films (which I've never heard of) had to pull the plug on the ending. After thinking about the film, my only idea is that they did not need to continue the film because we can just pull out the device in our pockets. They did not need to cover the next decade, because we already know what happens. The company expands so greatly that Steve gets his wish of changing the world with over 25% of American adults, owning iPhones.\r I felt the film started to drag on, even though some scenes were rushed. For example, Steve's wife and children came into the picture at a time that didn't seem appropriate. Overall, I think Jobs really defines Steve\u2019s life, and the start, and growth of the company everyone knows about.

It is a truly unremarkable biopic of the \"master of innovation\" as you could possibly imagine. \"Jobs\" follows an overly safe, unimaginative course that clocks in at a tiresome 122 minutes. The storytelling is painfully straightforward, covering only the principal events of his professional trials and tribulations, and providing little else beyond what is already public knowledge.\r Developing his imagination for computer programming at Atari, Steve Jobs (Ashton Kutcher) brings in his friend Steve Wozniak (Josh Gad) to help with the hardware aspect, forming a partnership that would soon lead to the founding and development of Apple Computers, a force within the industry throughout the 1980s. Steve is not prepared for the financial demands and the ruthless business mentality, and is eventually forced out of the company he began, only to return in the 1990s with a fresh game plan on how to bring Apple back into the public consciousness, and to dominate the industry once again.\r \"Jobs\" is a biopic with a very narrow focus, and without any sense of risk or adventure. It is so intent on covering Jobs' entire corporate career, that it simply reduces his personal life to a footnote. Stern completely glosses over Jobs' personal life, which is essential to any self-respecting biopic.  The entire production feels rushed and slapped together simply to benefit from being the first one out of the gate.\r To his credit, Kutcher puts forth a good effort, and he undeniably looks the part of Steve Jobs. Unfortunately, Ashton always looks like he is trying too hard to play the part, and never fully becomes the character he's portraying. His limitations on the big screen prove to be a major liability. He has developed a screen persona as likeable character, which has served him well with numerous TV sitcoms. Not so much with movies.\r What emerges is a movie that has \"a made for TV\" feel, which depicts a self-absorbed creep who stabs everyone in the back to simply to get his way that goes on for two plus hours. A thoroughly unsatisfying tribute, and we are still left none the wiser as to what made \"The Father of the Digital Revolution\" beyond what we already know."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Jobs is a boring movie.

Two years later, from director Joshua Michael Stern, we have Jobs; a bio-pic that should have looked back on the extraordinary life and career of Steve Jobs, but rather focuses more on the boardroom drama of Apple Computers.\r Ashton Kutcher does a fair acting attempt with a respectful performance, even taking on Jobs\u2019 distinctive mannerisms and walking stride.  Comic relief is provided in the way of Josh Gad, who portrays Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. The rest of the cast does its fair share at responding to Kutcher\u2019s rants, looking wide eyed and fearful when needed.\r I feel the problem with Jobs comes from the script, which focuses on Jobs being a neurotic, unlikeable, vindictive, angry genius and bad father, who suffers from occasional screaming fits, usually done while speeding his sports car through the rain.\r Much of Steve Jobs\u2019 personal life is randomly mentioned in the film, one moment being the emotional impact his adoption had on him which is touched upon during an LSD trip. Omitted completely is the important work Jobs held with Pixar, his development of the iPhone, his emotional search of his biological parents, how he met and married his wife, and most important his history with Bill Gates, the latter being reduced to a heated one sided phone call with Jobs screaming at the top of his lungs.\r Maybe Steve Jobs wasn\u2019t the nicest person when he was alive, but surely he deserved more than this depressing, uninspired and disappointing film.\r D+"}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Ashton Kutcher may have the talent to play Steve Jobs, but the rest of the movie cuts out a few very important details of his life, while being monotonous in the process.

As a film that serves to show Steve Jobs (Ashton Kutcher) going from guy in garage building personal computers to guy in charge of Apple it works. I\u2019m not quite familiar with the life of Steve Jobs but the story seemed to flow alright. Making a bio-pic may not have been the best course of action for the film as its story is stretched out. Rather than focus on a specific point in Jobs life (ex. working in his garage) the film shows a broad approach. On one end, this helps to show how far Jobs has come in certain areas going from nothing to a big celebrity but at the same time it means that none of these moments can be fleshed out a lot. The film is constantly jumping around causing jobs arc from jerk to megajerk to nice guy doesn\u2019t get fleshed out properly. The film feels long and empty because it covers so much yet there is no substance or heart to allow me to connect to Jobs\u2019 struggle. The film fails to flesh out Jobs as a character and at times it just feels like a cheap rip-off of The Social Network where a smart genius is a jerk pushing away people while climbing the ladder of success.  It feels like an Oscar wannabe at times with all the key moments guy struggling and lots of shouting clips that I\u2019m guessing the filmmakers thought could be used when Ashton Kutcher got the nomination he never received. It\u2019s a shame too considering how the filmmakers got a lot of actors that look like their real-life counter-parts, J.K. Simmons, and a relaxing guitar score; that isn\u2019t enough to cut though the film needs substance and heart and this film lacks it.

It really didn't teach you much about \"Who is Steve Jobs?\" it was almost like it was in fast forward, it just showed a few events that occurred yet somehow it was dragged to over 2 hours. Ashton Kutcher was possibly the worst possible choice to play Steve Jobs, only thing he did well was Steve's walk which really isn't a big deal at all. It's not all his fault as to why this film was bad, the other reason is Joshua Michael Stern who has next to nothing under his belt director or writer wise. This movie was written horribly and Ashton Kutcher like I said before was the worst choice. Ben Affleck would've been a great choice in my opinion but I know Ben certainly wouldn't agree to be a part of this awful script. 3/10 although 2 is probably more deserving but I'll give it a charity point.

The problem of the movie is that it waste a story with so great potential, I mean the director could evaluate the reaction of the protagonist during the time without job, or when he lose all his friends, and even when he was successful. Although there are some things that are really good, for example how it manage to capture the legend that Jobs represent, also is the unbelievable acting of Ashton Kutcher, and the way it is use the camera; because at the beginning of the film we see the moment when the IPod was presented and Steve was at the summit of his career, the camera record from below, giving the character an unreachable figure.

Ashton Kutcher is the only actor who I can name off the top of my head, who was in Jobs. Besides JK Simmons who has such a memorable face that I will always recognise him. You may think that the story of the movie was already prepared, but the writers had to pick some events in Steve Job's life which were interesting. They did not do it too well. I would have preferred to have seen more about the later life of Steve Jobs, than him sitting in an office shouting at people. The writers obviously noticed how good Ashton Kutcher looked as old Steve Jobs and decided to give him as little screen time as possible. Also it was not made clear what year's things were taking place in. I'm not an expert on Steve Jobs so I have no idea what year he was born in (probably in the 50's), after watching the movie about his company. I still don't know. One of the things I did like was the soundtrack. There was some of The Beatles some of The Rolling Stones (I think) and it really gave the movie a vintage feel. I'm guessing that's when a lot of it took place because I had no idea what year it was most of the time. To be honest Jobs did not teach me much about Steve Jobs at all. I can't remember what college he went to (even though it's in the second scene). I can't remember the name of his wife. Or whether she was even his wife?\r As an autobiographical movie Jobs is not good and focuses more on which people he shouted at than what products he made.
