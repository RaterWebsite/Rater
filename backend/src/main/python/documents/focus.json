Watching Smith bed down Robbie is another Hollywood \"stick it in your face\" combination that totally pisses me off. The movie itself as entertaining as it was it was nothing out of the ordinary. With the exception of Robbie in that black swim suit. Wow! Following the story line was pretty decent..no deep thinking required here. Smith is in a slump for box office hits. This one is no exception. The producers could have saved a ton of money by offering the role to one of the up and coming young actors who would have done the part for a lot less then what I'm sure Smith got paid. As you can tell I'm not a fan. The movie itself was interesting enough and made you want to get in the profession of picking pockets. The scenes as Smith teaches Robbie the tricks of the trade were pretty clever. A movie worth seeing. Oh yes...she could pick my pockets anytime."}], "recommendations": ["the_bodyguard", "the_dilemma", "going_in_style", "parker", "the_boy_next_door", "the_hustle", "just_go_with_it", "knight_and_day", "the_assignment", "the_boss", "the_proposal", "horrible_bosses", "bad_teacher", "my_spy", "no_strings_attached", "last_vegas", "alex_cross", "killers", "red", "the_break_up", "aquamarine", "the_first_time", "reprisal", "spy", "trainwreck"]}
