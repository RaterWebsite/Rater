Makes me think whats happened to Disney :( Mufasa (James Earl Jones) is Simba's dad and has the perfect voice for a strong lion teaching his son the lessons in life. Like not to take being future king for granted, it's not about getting your own way. And that everyone is one. He also tells his son about the stars, and if he is not here in later life, then to look up at the stars as all of the great kings are up there watching over him. Samba being a small cub has to learn the hard way because of his evil uncle scar. At first he truss to trick samba and forces him to go against his fathers will. It ends up with samba leaving pride rock, but finds two true friends who bring him back to his normal self with the help of an old friend and his fathers friend who christened him at birth. Samba returns to pride Rock some years later, returning the once great land back to how it used to be. And continues with Simba and Nala having a child of there own. And continues, the circle of life. such powerful scenes that can make grown men cry (who are not dead inside) and powerful voice acting that fit each roll perfectly.

The songs were memorable and amazing, the characters were believable (and arguably acted more human than many movies with human actors), and the animation was vibrant and lush, depicting a unique style of art, and still getting the movements of the characters down pat. The story really digs deep into Simba's character, which leaves the other characters a bit stagnant, but that's not to say they aren't developed. They each have their own part to play in the story. The comic relief detracts from the heavier story just enough to keep the feature from being too depressing (it is disney, they like a lighter feel to their movies).Now, on the controversy some people have brought up about \"Disney ripping off 'Kimba: The White Lion'\", I looked into it, and in terms of story and characters, it seems the two are separate. Some art direction seems to have gone the same direction, although Disney and the guys who did Kimba did start working together on a project related to Kimba. The project was scrapped, but the people who had worked on the project probably decided to adapt some concept art to Lion King. Btw, the similarity of the names \"Simba\" and \"Kimba\" is probably coincidental, considering most of the names in \"The Lion King\" are based on Swahili words (simba means 'lion').Regardless, it is a solid movie that I recommend."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "The best animated movie of all time.

So deserved."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "One of the biggest hits created by Disney in 1994 was The Lion King. This movie entices children with its memorable songs and fantastic characters. It is one of Disney\u2019s greatest musicals, even though there are some scary moments. Despite the few violent scenes, the overall messages portrayed are hope, love, family, and responsibility. This film is a great choice for children as well as adults.\rThe film is about Simba (Jonathon Taylor Thomas) and how he \u201cjust can\u2019t wait to be king.\u201d That being said, his evil Uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons) is extremely jealous of his brother Mufasa (James Earl Jones) because Mufasa is the king of the jungle. His extreme jealously gets the best of him, and Scar has Mufasa killed by a stampede and makes Simba feel responsible. Simba, feeling overwhelming guilt and despair, then runs away and becomes friends with Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella) and Timon (Nathan Lane) who teach him that the best philosophy is \u201cHakuna Matata\u201d, which means no worries. Simba is having the best time while with Timon and Pumbaa. He feels free and great about himself because he has nothing to worry about. Simba grows up thinking he has escaped his childhood until his old friend Nala, who is living under Scar\u2019s leadership, finds him and tells him that the tribe has been having severe issues.\rThe Lion King was originally inspired by William Shakespeare\u2019s play, Hamlet. The Lion King\u2019s themes and imagery relate to cultural and political situations in the United States and Africa. Along with this, many parts of the film resemble a famous Japanese television show Kimba the White Lion. Two characters in this show are Kimba and Simba. In The Lion King, the camera angles and composition are almost identical to this television show. The voice of Simba almost believed he was working on a remake of Kimba because he was familiar with the show. The movie is mainly about lifestyle choices and collective responsibility. This is where the majority of the movie got several of its ideas.\rThe protagonist, Simba, starts off as a rebellious character whom then grows up and learns to accept his responsibilities instead of seeking revenge. The characters in the film are always filled with energy which shows how much hard work went into each character and their personality, looks, and overall appearance. Each character has there own appealing look and personality, which draws so much attention to them. Along with this, they each have a voice that is very engaging to listen to. The characters have comical senses of humor and perform each scene in a joyful way. When Mufasa emerges in a cloud for Simba and talks to him, he gives Simba hope and inspires him to go and regain his throne. This scene shows how family is always there for you, even when all hope is gone. Not only are the characters funny, but they have a meaningful and serious side as well.\rThe Lion King is a spectacular film for all ages. Although the movie is a cartoon, it is appealing to adults as well because it has a message behind it that can captivate even the oldest of audiences. Even if the children do not grasp the entirety of the overall message, they still love the film because of its entertainment. It keeps you interested the entire time and captivates everyone into feeling compelled to finish it. The directors and producers used great sounds effects and were able to get the audience to sing along with them. The colors and their brightness that was used enhances the film and makes it much more enjoyable and fun to watch. Every scene has an attracting look and amusing music, which always makes it pleasurable to watch. They used music to connect the funny scenes back to the overall message such as \u201cCircle of Life\u201d and \u201cHakuna Matata\u201d. Circle of Life is played during the ceremony when Simba is born and at the end for Simba and Nala\u2019s newborn club. Simba is baptized here and the whole kingdom comes together to see him. Hakuna Matata is played when Simba arrives at the jungle home and continues to play during a sequence in which Simba grows up. This shows that Simba puts his problems behind him and lives the life he wants. The music makes a child not want to take their eyes off the screen because of the energetic characters and catchy rhythm. The filmmakers used animated programs to show their visuals. The stampede scene was created in a 3D computer program so the characters could be multiplied. The visuals are very clever and give off a fun, loving, and spirited tone. The movie is presented with amazing animation, music, and choreography. The animators of the story studied real-life animals for reference and some even journeyed on a trip to Africa. This assisted in how the animators made the characters act during many of the scenes. This also helped them to better understand the animal environment and way of life. A wildlife expert visited the studio to help the writers with the animal behavior and to help the artists with their drawings. Brenda Chapman, one of the story heads, said that writing an original story is very challenging because there is nothing to fall back on.\rThe Lion King displays that if one is in a dark place, be strong and take the next challenge as it comes. Each character has there own way of doing this, which makes the film so much more interesting to watch. The film portrays many different ideas and responsibilities making it a movie for everyone to watch and enjoy with a lesson learned. The writers created a wonderful original story. The filmmakers did an incredible job with the characters, scenery, and animation. The Lion King is a warm, loving, fun film that everyone should have a chance to see."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I grow up with this and my children's will, too.

Obviously it is one of the disney movies to feature death, which I think in a way is good to ease children into the idea of it."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "When people talk about their favorite Disney film, 'The Lion King' is an answer that always comes up, no matter what generation of Disney you're talking about. The 1990s was a very strong decade for the Walt Disney Studios, as they came off a string of successes with 'The Little Mermaid' (1989), 'Beauty and the Beast' (1991) (this is MY favorite Disney film) and 'Aladdin' (1992).\r Even after 'The Lion King', there were other films that were not appreciated by the critics mostly, but audiences loved anyway, 'Pocahontas' (1995) and 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' (1996) spring to mind.\r 'The Lion King' is essentially Hamlet, but with lions, it opens with the best opening sequence I've seen in any film, animated or live-action. \"The Circle of Life\" is an iconic song to open with an we see the sun rising and all the different animals of different breeds gather around to witness the birth of their new future king. A lion cub is lifted before them and the animals bow together. The lion cub is Simba and we witness his adventure in the movie.\r We meet his uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons) who is jealous as he wants to be king, but the birth of Simba compromises his chances, and his brother Mufasa (James Earl Jones) tries to reason with Scar.\r Simba gets into a predicament where Scar plans to kill Mufasa and tells Simba to run away. Unlike Disney's 'Bambi' (1942), the death of Mufasa happens on-screen and can be traumatizing to the younger audience.\r As Simba has run away, he meets a meerkat and a warthog, Timon and Pumbaa who raise Simba from his teen years into his adulthood. But when Scar is king of Pride Rock, the entire group want Simba back and gain his status as the rightful king.\r Of all the Disney films released in the 1990s, 'The Lion King' is the one people speak highly of the most, and for good reason as it is less sugar-coated than 'The Little Mermaid' and 'Beauty and the Beast' and less comical than 'Aladdin'. The movie tells a serious story with the occasional comedy to lighten up the mood for when the film gets too serious. The songs are catchy too and the story is not hard to follow, even for kids.\r So why did I give this film a 9 instead of the perfect 10 everybody is rating it? Well, I do think that 'Beauty and the Beast' (1991) is actually the best film from Disney and 'The Lion King', for me, has some flaws that prevent it from being perfect. Everybody seems to over-praise this film, but here are my problems.\r The songs for me, were a little disappointing, considering they are by Tim Rice and Elton John, I only loved \"The Circle of Life\" and \"Be Prepared\"...I found \"I Just can't wait to be King\" and \"Hakuna Matata\" a little annoying, even as a kid. \"Can you feel the love tonight?\" felt a little shoe-horned in the film, but the Elton John version is brilliant.\r Certain things happen in the third act still make no sense to me, even as a child I didn't understand and still don't understand now. Let's just say that a certain character admits their faults and the film can end after that. I couldn't help but feel that the third act felt rushed just so it can get to the conclusion.\r However, the positives do outweigh the negatives, the animation is still as beautiful as ever (particularly \"The Circle of Life\" sequence), the film tells a really good story and there is pure heart and emotion put into this picture.\r I don't think 'The Lion King' is the best Disney film of all time, that title, for me, goes to 'Beauty and the Beast' (1991), but this is definitely in my top 10."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "The artistic medium of film is very subjective. Every audience member has a different set of criteria they use to measure their viewing experience. Not everyone shares the same set of criteria. If we did, what a bland and uninspired world this would be.\r What I Personally Liked About \"The Lion King\":\rEvery good film starts with a good skeletal structure: the story itself. From that story, all of the other pieces will fall into place. In this case, the story is a beautifully told one centered on familial commitment, the responsibilities you have to yourself and the obligations you have to those who count on your support. The maturation of a destined character has always been a great structural starting point and this time it delivers in abundance. There is also some very good hard-edged humor, particularly surrounding Scar, which doesn't play down to younger audiences. Instead, it treats all of its viewers as equals; something modern Disney filmmakers have a tendency to toss aside. The animation itself is peerless, filled with wonderfully bright colors, crisp lines, deep shadows, lush greenery, and sharply drawn leads. The animation is backed with some of the best voice work Disney had yet utilized in one of their movies. James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Whoopi Goldberg and Nathan Lane fill the spotlight with their charm and add a wonderful dimension to the characters they portray. There are a couple of unforgettable specifics to this animated classic to go over as well. Mufasa's death scene, for one. It is a somber, restrained affair with a perfectly accented score and a real sense of loss defining the event. Too, the epic, slow motion fight sequence between Simba and Scar backlit by the burning embers beneath Pride Rock is a visually stunning treat one rarely sees in a Disney film.\r What I Personally Disliked About \"The Lion King\":\rThere is a song in this film entitled \"Be Prepared.\" Not only is it the weakest song of the picture, but it is also the worst blot on Jeremy Irons' otherwise impeccable career. Irons gives a menacing performance throughout the rest of the film. His dark, creepy delivery of the lines sends chills up and down my spine each and every time I hear them. That merely makes this horrible song seem more out of place. It shamefully slows down the pace of the film where a macabre monologue would have better served the purpose of the story. Fortunately, there's really not much else to dislike about this presentation.\r My Overall Impression of \"The Lion King\":\rNot only would I classify this as the single best film Disney released in its decade, I would also offer the opinion that this is the best film Disney has released since 1994 (excluding Pixar's involvement). It has a wealth of memorable music, a powerful story arc, excellent animation, and fitting vocal performances. Animation simply does not get much better than this."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "The film is the latest in a series of annual media events from Disney, which with \"The Little Mermaid,\" \"Beauty and the Beast\" and \"Aladdin\" reinvented its franchise of animated feature films. The inspiration for these recent films comes from the earliest feature cartoons created by Walt Disney himself, who in movies like \"Dumbo,\" with the chaining of Mrs. Jumbo, and \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,\" with its wicked stepmother, tapped into primal fears and desires. Later Disney films drifted off into the neverland of innocuous \"children's movies,\" which were harmless but not very exciting. These most recent four animated features are once again true \"family films,\" in that they entertain adults as well as children.\r \"The Lion King\" is the first Disney animated feature not based on an existing story. In another sense, it is based on half the stories in classical mythology. It tells the tale of the birth, childhood and eventual manhood of Simba, a lion cub. The cub's birth is announced in the opening sequence of the movie, called \"The Circle of Life,\" which is an evocative collaboration of music and animation to show all of the animals of the African veld gathering to hail their future king. The cute little cub is held aloft from a dramatic spur of rock, and all his future minions below hail him, in a staging that looks like the jungle equivalent of a political rally.\r Of course this coming together of zebra and gazelle, monkey and wildebeest, fudges on the uncomfortable fact that many of these animals survive by eating one another. And all through \"The Lion King\" the filmmakers perform a balancing act between the fantasy of their story and the reality of the jungle. Early scenes show Simba as a cute, trusting little tike who believes everyone loves him. He is wrong. He has an enemy - his uncle Scar, the king's jealous brother, who wants to be king himself one day.\r Villains are often the most memorable characters in a Disney animated film, and Scar is one of the great ones, aided by a pack of yipping hyenas who act as his storm troopers. With a voice by Jeremy Irons, and facial features suggestive of Irons' gift for sardonic concealment, Scar is a mannered, manipulative schemer who succeeds in bringing about the death of the king.\r Worse, he convinces Simba that the cub is responsible, and the guilty little heir slinks off into the wastelands. (The movie makes a sly reference to a famous earlier role by Irons. When Simba tells him, \"You're so weird,\" he replies \"You have no idea,\" in exactly the tone he used in \"Reversal of Fortune.\") It is an unwritten law that animated features have comic relief, usually in the form of a duet or trio of goofy characters who become buddies with the hero. This time they are a meerkat named Timon (voice by Nathan Lane) and a warthog named Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella), who cheer up Simba during his long exile.\r The movie has a large cast of other colorful characters, including a hornbill named Zazu (Rowan Atkinson), who is confidant and advisor to King Mufasa (James Earl Jones). And there are the three hyenas (with voices by Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin and Jim Cummings), who are a tumbling, squabbling, yammering team of dirty tricks artists.\r The early Disney cartoons were, of course, painstakingly animated by hand. There has been a lot of talk recently about computerized animation, as if a computer program could somehow create a movie. Not so. Human animators are responsible for the remarkably convincing portrayals of Scar and the other major characters, who somehow combine human and animal body language. But computers did assist with several remarkable sequences, including a stampede in which a herd seems to flow past the camera.\r Despite the comic relief from the hyenas, the meerkat and the warthog, \"The Lion King\" is a little more subdued than \"Mermaid,\" \"Beauty\" and \"Aladdin.\" The central theme is a grim one: A little cub is dispossessed, and feels responsible for the death of its father.\r An uncle betrays a trust.\r And beyond the gently rolling plans of the great savanna lies a wasteland of bones and ashes. Some of the musical comedy numbers break the mood, although with the exception of \"Circle of Life\" and \"Hakuna Matata,\" the songs in \"The Lion King\" are not as memorable as those in \"Mermaid\" and \"Beauty.\" Basically what we have here is a drama, with comedy occasionally lifting the mood. The result is a surprising seriousness; this isn't the mindless romp with cute animals that the ads might lead you to expect. Although the movie may be frightening and depressing to the very young, I think it's positive that \"The Lion King\" deals with real issues. By processing life's realities in stories, children can prepare themselves for more difficult lessons later on. The saga of Simba, which in its deeply buried origins owes something to Greek tragedy and certainly to \"Hamlet,\" is a learning experience as well as an entertainment. 3.5/4."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "The greatest animated movie of all time.

I admit that I cried at the point where Mufassa had died, but only a true film artist could give such emotion into a movie. Now that I have watched it a few more times, I get the full view of the movie and understand what I did not before. This is one of the only movies that I know of that has been this extraordinary and well thought out. I give tremendous respect to the creators of the excellent animation."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "The thing that makes this movie truly a masterpiece is the fact that it deals with real life. I believe this movie was created to present the meaning of the greatest thing that human beings face.This is the circle of life. I watched this film when I was six and it really stigmatized my life(I'm 18 now).The combination of the melanholic and celebrating soundtrack together with the vivid characters make this movie so wonderful and appealing to all ages.This is definitely one of Disney's greatest successes that has been a strong example to many kids all over the world incuding me. It has beautifully taught us about the meaning and the values of life. This film will always be in our hearts."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "A beautifully drawn animation allied with a strong narrative and fantastic musical numbers made \"The Lion King\" one of the Disney greatest accomplishments."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Funny how Disney and Pixar can make films and get praised for them. I mean, I love the songs - Hakuna Matata is my favourite - it's understandable though that they can say it's merely 'a coincidence' that this is similar to another animation and obtain a huge profit. It's unfair how companies like this can prey on the smaller ones for the sake of it. They can add these certain things to films, but I'm not saying that they're bad. I love how they can inject humour into animation, which I only really saw when Timon and Pumbaa were on the screen, and actually make the characters work, but this doesn't mean it's completely original. I don't think The Lion King can actually be given a higher score, because, although it did work, it didn't feel like they had done it themselves."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "The king of Disney indeed. The Lion King marks the pinnacle of Disney's Renaissance of the 1990s, and the best film to come out of that studio ever. Taking its roots from Shakespeare and Hamlet, it is more grown-up and epic than one would expect. Definitely one to keep on your DVD shelf."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "I had high hopes for this movie, but on all my viewings, I felt very disappointed. The film does not have much to offer, unlike other Disney masterpieces. I hope to have better viewings of this film in the future."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "One day Simba, you will become the king, when the sun are rises and take responsibility for your past."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "The best Disney film ever drawn."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "best film ever!!!! camera angles are very great! detail of shading in the characters, backgrounds and the way the film has been animated couldn't have been any better. people who don't see the sense of the film are just brainless and don't have any kind of imagination and a sense of seing films in a different way! it's the best traditional animated film by far and i wish there will be more films like that in future."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This is the greatest Disney film of all time and possibly the most greatest cultural achievment of the the 20th century. I dont feel these critic reviews are accurate because they only watched this once and did not fully grasp the brilliance of this fim in its entirity."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "THis film is a definite masterpiece, nearly flawless. The story is excellently told, the soundtrack is breathtaking. The animation is a feast for the eyes. There's plenty of humor for adults and kids. This has classic written all over it."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "i love this film so much. I used to watch it when i was little but i didn't really understand the meaning of this film. before, it was just a film which entertained me. now after i watched it, not only does it entertain me but also gives me a message. This film is truly the best film ever made, it's entertaining, friendly, funny and makes me feel like a new person. i rate this movie an 11."}], "recommendations": ["the_prince_of_egypt", "anastasia", "the_princess_and_the_frog", "wolfwalkers", "aladdin", "moana", "song_of_the_sea", "treasure_planet", "the_little_prince", "spirit_stallion_of_the_cimarron", "luca", "finding_nemo", "the_book_of_life", "klaus", "pocahontas", "atlantis_the_lost_empire", "tarzan", "over_the_moon", "the_sword_in_the_stone", "tangled", "cinderella", "the_polar_express", "your_name", "the_jungle_book", "a_christmas_carol"]}
