I was very surprised at how funny and cute this movie was with no words. So different from what I'm used to, better than the other kids movies. It was worth the money, Yes I recommend it, I will be bringing my daughter to see it also."

It's loaded with the witty gags and wacky characters. To make it even more inventive, there's no dialogue: only animal noises, grunts, goofy sound effects and a bouncy soundtrack. While there aren't American style broad jokes, there are plenty of sweet, clever and delightful moments. A charming experience for anyone who enjoys engaging animation."

      "text": "Another enjoyable outing from Aardman Animations who also gave us Wallace and Gromit. Whilst perhaps not quite as good as its predecessor this still can boast an inventive story that is also a lot of fun. Being dialogue free is in no way a hindrance to the film\u2019s success as the rich detail on display is not only clever but elicits more than a few chuckles. The restaurant scene alone is worth the price of admission. Adult audiences who are true film buffs will also relish the references made to classic movies of the past such as \u2018Taxi Driver\u2019. These asides will, of course, go over the heads of tots but they won\u2019t care as there is so much else on display for them to enjoy. The last twenty minutes or so become a tad frenetic which is a common failing in toons these days. However, at a time when animated films seem to be in the doldrums it is ironic that this is also CGI free."

I don\u2019t know if I have ever seen a film of any kind that was so constantly inventive without ever being heavy-handed. The film was like skating fast on a frozen river where danger and cleverness lurked at every turn. The film was beautifully done both visually and story-wise. And watch for the Silence of the Lambs and Night of the Hunter references."

A mix up with the Farmer, a caravan, and a very steep hill lead them all to the Big City and it's up to Shaun and the flock to return everyone safely to the green grass of home.\r I know these a lot of people that may not seen the TV series of Shaun the Sheep and here's my quick opinion on the TV series. I liked the show, I thought the animation was pretty good I mean stop motion never get's old well to me it doesn't. The show had a good sense of humor to it and the character's without talking makes them even more enjoyable to watch. Now we got the movie and to my surprise this is actually a enjoyable movie and a great one as well.\r The animation once again looks well detailed and great I mean just like I said before about stop motion animation never getting old and still looks great even today. Nice work to the people who did the animation for the movie, you made a good looking movie.\r The character's in the movie are the same in the TV series and I'm saying that in a positive way because them not saying anything only sheep noises and you also got a dog that don't talk (Thank the lord for that) but anywhere they dialogue are them talking in their own animal langue and it's still interesting to see them interacting with each other like that, and that takes talent for me to be more interested with character's that are not human or don't talk human.\r The whole movie is trying to get the farmer home just because he got knocked out by a solid object and falls into caravan it falls into town and all of the sheep and the pet dog from the farm have to go out and search for him, that's whole the movie right there and it's short and to my surprise it flowed very well not like other movies that are short and the story line is too basic.\r If I have to name problems from the movie these only some like: The villain of the movie just felt like your basic, cliche, not that interesting villain with a poor character ark that every time his on I felt it would be a lot better if he wasn't there at all. And that's really it for problems.\r Overall Shaun the Sheep: The Movie is a good family movie with clever and well thought out jokes that flow extremely well even for a kids movie. Great character's, outstanding animation, funny humor and a good stand alone movie that's worth seeing if you have seen the show, if you have not please watch the show first to get to know everyone and then watch the movie."

Yeah, its pretty crazy, when you think about how long this film is. I hope that audiences in the USA will search up 'SHAUN THE SHEEP' on YouTube and watch the original shorts, AND the original short (if you're wondering, search up 'Wallace and Gromit: A Close Shave on YouTube). Anyway, if you're new to Aardman Animation then definitely check this one out. Its got the great British humour that all things Aardman have, and its a great movie for the whole family to enjoy."

While this movie is more directed at children, adults will get plenty of enjoyment from this as well. The slapstick humor offers plenty of hilarious moments, and on numerous occasions everybody in the theater will find themselves laughing hysterically. Besides that the film is beautifully animated, which is even more impressive when one considers the time it takes to make a stop animation film. I will say the biggest surprise was the emotional depth of the film, filled with characters that couldn't talk, it conveyed a story that everybody could follow that was never weak, and had moments that made me feel like a child again, from the opening to the heartbreaking scene in the barbershop. In essence Shaun the Sheep is everything you want it to be for kids and adults, it's hilarious, nice to look at, but it also has a great emotional depth, much like the best works of Pixar."

This show was watched by many adults as well, a popular one among all the ages. As the fan of this series, we have been waiting very long to get a movie version. I was excited to see it and of course enjoyed it completely. Its impossible one to get disappointed with the movie/show when the narration is led by one of the awesome characters, Shaun. The promotional posters were also created some extra curiosity that imitated the famous Hollywood films like 'Boyhood', 'Wild', 'Birdman' and many others.\r Stop-motion is a very-very hard and outdated concept of the animation format, but still loved by many. Every year only one or two get released, sometimes none. The technical sides were upgraded, including bluescreens for backgrounds and other special effects. Still the hard work remains, but qualities are improved. It made significant contributions to the live-shot movies in the old days when there was no CGI. So when we see a movie like this, the product reveals in each and every frames the real vision from the artist and writer's perspective. Every detail, every corner of the screen tells the story.\r It was so good as a television show, because of short and sweetness. The filmmaker intended to create the same magic, except the credits its just a below 80 minute movie. Had a good storyline and a couple of new characters were introduced. Because the new adventure extended its area volume and so the antagonist was needed. Shaun and his buddies set foot outside their barn to find their lost farmer. The journey begins towards the big city and the movie discloses their risky and dangerous undertaking. They go pass lots of stages to accomplish their quest and only the last quarter reveals result with a thrilling chase scene.\r Unlike the series, it was not completely a fun movie. There are some emotions involved, and I was amazed by those exhibitions. Because of some kind of childhood connection between Shaun and Co and their owner. That was unexpected, but was really very nice to see the other side of them. We know Shaun is a curious character, he always wants to learn and try new things. So when he has to make an unexpected decision, it does not go as planned and the fun begins with their mischievous adventure in an unfamiliar territory.\r As usual without the dialogues, that can be understandable by everyone without a language barrier. A true family movie, from grandparents to grandchildren together watchable flick. Almost a masterpiece, offers a lot of great moments to give ourselves to it. And for the fans its a celebration time for sure. Definitely this movie would get into the final shortlist for the upcoming (2016) Oscars, if not, that would be a shame for the entire ceremony. But for winning, we have to wait till how good 'The Good Dinosaur' going to be. In the meantime, don't miss this little cute flick.\r 8\u00bd/10"

I probably had the same problem with this film as I had with minions. It isn't bad idea but it's too much minutes for too little words.Shaun the Sheep is great idea but much more enjoyable when it's in seven minutes instead of 85. I think that story had too slow tempo for how long it was and I also felt like I already saw it because the story wasn't really original when it comes to it and also gags in this movie weren't really that funny. I think that even 5-years-old are already full of this same kind of jokes.I personally enjoyed \"emotional part\" of this movie more, than I enjoyed the \"funny part\".On the other hand I really loved animation and soundtrack of this film which was truly briliant and one of the factors why I had energy to finish this movie because without it I wouldn't do that and for me, the last 15 minutes of this movie was the best part.

Not only did Aardman throw their back out creating charming stop-motion but they told a story without dialogue. The story is conveyed through creative ways and charming characters. Sheep who are mischevious yet still likeable, a clich\u00e9 animal catcher whose still charming, and a dog who just is trying to do his job. With characters are charming as these you won\u2019t want to throw them away like the animal catcher but take them home and adopt them. This isn\u2019t a deep, tear-jerker like Inside Out; but there is something entertaining about a film that doesn\u2019t have a deep story, water itself down for children, or bombard you pop culture references constantly (ok there are two in here that are cute) but instead keeps things simple and gives you characters to connect with. Aardman continues to shine in these elements and hopefully they\u2019ll stick around and make more films like these."

The absence of spoken dialogue was something I had not seen in a feature film for a long time, at least since the last time I watched a silent movie. But I didn't get annoyed, on the contrary. I thought it has its own beauty and it's funny, even though it's not the kind of movie I see every day.We do not have a fixed plot. The story told is very light and gives space for the several jokes and humour moments that they wanted to create in the middle. In essence, the film tells how a flock of funny sheep tries to find their farmer, missing for days in the middle of the big city and suffering from amnesia. Of course, there is a villain, who is the city's animal control agent (we've seen something like that in other animal movies in town).This is a stop-motion animated film... nothing more, nothing less than the most laborious and arduous technique for making animated films. Aardman still uses it regularly, probably being the latest animation studio to do so, and is adept at this technique, so it should not be surprising if I say that the whole film is technically impeccable. Even the soundtrack worked very well. As I already mentioned, I was very surprised at the decision not to use spoken dialogue. But it even made sense, because it puts human beings at the margins of history to give space to animals.The film earned the Oscar nomination in its respective category (\"Best Animated Film\"), but never went beyond that. Despite this, and the film seems to have been quickly forgotten by the public, it did deserve it. It's not brilliant nor remarkable, it's perfectly forgettable due to the absence of an impact script... but it's a technical feat and it's funny."
