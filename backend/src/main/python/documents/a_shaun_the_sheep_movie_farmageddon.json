This newest installment in the Shaun the Sheep series doesn't disappoint. The idyllic life of the farm creatures is disrupted when an alien lands\u2026and a cute one at that. The fast-paced adventure is loaded with witty gags and wacky characters, including the funniest android/robot comedy bits ever. There are some sweet moments that actually tug at the heart. Overall, it\u2019s a delightful and charming experience for anyone who enjoys engaging animation. NOTE: Sit thru all the credits: 1 gag midway and an extended gag at the very end."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Aardman Animations' work is charming as ever.

Ma qui c'\u00e8 sempre l'impegno e lo sforzo di uno degli studi d'animazione pi\u00f9 sottovalutati che abbiamo. Se non ci fossero dei clich\u00e9 di troppo, sfortunatamente dettati dal genere fantascientifico a cui appartiene, avrei detto che mi ha fatto molto pi\u00f9 ridere rispetto al primo capitolo.

It came across as a tad dated and cliched."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Usually a movie shows and tells a story. In the world of Aardman Studios' stop-motion animation, there is no telling but showing for the first three minutes within the introduction of the protagonist(s) who use their gestures for, just like in \"Chicken Run\" and \"The Curse of the Were-Rabbit\". However in this farm-environmental flick, this no-dialogue implement is not used for the first three minutes of the film, it is used for the entire eighty-five minutes. This artistry reminds of a \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoon where the precocious mouse and the inelegant cat do not use verbal communication on screen, just like Gromit the dog and by all means, in our world of lucidity. I did not put on such a large grin on my face to an Aardman film like this since \"The Curse of the Were-Rabbit\" and I think Aardman studios are well on their way to bringing back their respected faith to the public eye."}], "recommendations": ["flushed_away", "madagascar", "shaun_the_sheep_movie", "hotel_transylvania_3_summer_vacation", "chicken_run", "penguins_of_madagascar", "the_lego_ninjago_movie", "cloudy_with_a_chance_of_meatballs_2", "the_boxtrolls", "the_lego_batman_movie", "america_the_motion_picture", "antz", "looney_tunes_back_in_action", "puss_in_boots_the_last_wish", "storks", "rango", "smurfs_the_lost_village", "who_framed_roger_rabbit", "madagascar_escape_2_africa", "shark_tale", "ratatouille", "ice_age", "monsters_university", "hotel_transylvania", "the_lego_movie"]}
