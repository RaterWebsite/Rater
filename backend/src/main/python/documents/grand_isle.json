      "text": "Nicolas Cage and his sultry wife lure a hunky young man into their home during a hurricane. All manner of suspicion and seduction ensues. The narrative unfolds via flashback interviews with a local detective (Kelsey Grammar unintentionally hilarious doing his best Tennessee Williams character). The Byzantine plot keeps trying to surprise, but the inevitable encounters are mostly predictable. Cage is acting like crazy (pun intended) and the others do fine. The direction manages to squeeze some mild tension here and there, but not nearly enough to make it worthwhile."
