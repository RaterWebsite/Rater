While Bond is still a womanizer, (something that will likely never completely change) this is toned down a notch to allow for some real story and character development. https://latetothegame.blog/2019/01/10/key-movies-of-my-life-james-bond-edition-from-russia-with-love-1963/"

      "text": "An intriguing, if mightily subdued sequel to \"Dr. No,\" \"From Russia With Love\" has a pretty fantastic second half, but with a fairly meager set-up and a middle portion that frequently teeters towards the edge of lethargy, I can't help but be a tad disappointed with it. Still, though, when the film does deliver, it does so in spades. The aforementioned latter half contains some pretty dynamite set pieces, a welcomed twist or two, and a fight scene that could easily go down as a franchise best. The problem is, of course, it takes a lot to get there. And with a rather lackluster set of stakes propelling those earlier events forward, it leaves me feeling thus; a good, yet nowhere near great Bond film, in my opinion."

      "text": "Clearly a better movie than the first one: the story is more complex and like a thriller. The action scenes are of course outdated, but there are not so many of them, because the movie focus more on the mind games between the agents. The locations are more divers from Istanbul to Italy."

      "text": "Having watched 25 Bonds from Dr.No to Spectre, I place From Russia With Love at 2/25.The second greatest Bond movie, and Sean Connery's favorite.It's a wonderful movie, full of memorable scenes, that sense of escapism of the early Bonds, the powerful feeling of traveling a world full of dangers and terrors.It's a movie that departs from the style set up by Dr.No, and that will return with the later movies, of a lone agent that lives between a vodka martini glass and some girl's arms, while shooting and bantering his way between the two. Instead, FRWL is a thriller, in the classic sense.The movie starts not with Bond, but with SPECTRE agents devising the plan to use him. Bond doesn't feel like the hunter in this movie, but the hunted. From start to almost finish, the movie shows or implies the actions of SPECTRE and Bond is increasingly alone and in danger, the noose tightening around him, scene after scene.There is such a great feeling of pressure, of danger, which is not detrimental to the escapism or the action, or the banter. It's a wonderful mix that makes this one sit atop the pile of a very, very large series.A must-see."

      "text": "The second James Bond cine film. It naturally improved as they perfected the formula. It is also the first appearance of Desmond Llewelyn as Q. He is a fan favorite and who does not want to have one of his gadgets or be smart and skilled enough to do his job? Also Specter is introduced a bit more. They slowly tease that there is more and you see glimpses of Blofeld who is also a favorite villain. It has become a trademark: Show someone petting a cat without seeing his face and you know he is a villain. This was so often used as parody by all media it became a trope. The story itself is pretty clear: James Bond has been recognized as serious threat for Specter after the events of the prequel. So they set up a trap involving a Soviet cryptographer device as bait. Former high ranked SMERSH member (A Soviet intelligence agency) Rosa Klebb recruits the innocent Tatiana Romanova for the transfer in exchange for protection and extraction. So begins the story. If you say this plan sounds like a trap then I will answer with \u201cThe best traps are those which are too good to be avoided\u201d. The bait is so good they have to react no matter what. The story is enjoyable as you know far more as viewer as the characters. It is a pleasure to see the events unfold. The actors are great. Sean Connery has become James Bond. Daniela Bianchi is fitting for the role as Tatianna Romanova. Rosa Klebb is menacing and a true schemer (She is no one I want to have as enemy). Special praise for Robert Shawn. He is a great actor and deserves more praise as he is often forgotten in the franchise. The sets and visuals look good for its time and I think it still holds up. The soundtrack is again really good. Overall this is an improvement and worth watching. It is however nowhere near the best James Bond movies. The next in line however is always mentioned as best movie."

      "text": "I loved From Russia With Love. If I had one minor problem with the film, it would be that I did find the film slow in places. But I cannot deny it is a tightly plotted and well acted James Bond thriller with superb action to boot. The film looks amazing, with wonderful cinematography and stunning locations, and the action is constantly fast paced and the stunts jaw dropping. The music score from John Barry is one of the more memorable scores in any Bond movie, with its brilliant main theme my favourite. We were also treated to the song From Russia With Love over the end credits, beautifully sung by the underrated Matt Munro. Sean Connery is in my eyes the definitive James Bond, handsome yet charismatic. As much as I did like Roger Moore and Daniel Craig(in general), Connery just has that extra something. Robert Shaw comes close to stealing the show, and Lotte Lenya as Rosa Klebb especially is unforgettable. All in all, superb is the only word I have to say about From Russia with Love. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

No matter how faithful it is to the original text and the cultural changes, the viewer falls squarely into the plot because of the typical elements. For useless trivia: Pedro Armendariz is the first Mexican to participate in the cast of a James Bond movie."

      "text": "An improved sequel to Dr. No, FRWL plays out much more like a Hitchcockian thriller with some brief moments of big-budget action (Ex. Boat chase, the helicopter chase), especially during the slow-burn scene where Bond tricks Red Grant (played wonderfully by Robert Shaw) into opening a booby-trapped brief case. I also always loved the exotic locale of Istanbul and Karen Bay is probably one of my favorite Bond supporting characters."

      "text": "They are keeping it low in this second round, making their enemies sweat and maybe, maybe they will make a mistake.From Russia With LoveYoung is back in a sensible and calm state that is more Hitchcock-ian- there is literally a sequence similar to the North By Northwest, which surprisingly is both, more and less realistic than it was- than De Palma-isc. This verbally brimmed counter play of each characters might not be particularly smart but is surely a mature way of exploring the wry business vacation. Terence Young, the director, this time, is definitely bringing new things on the table. One would assume that after getting all the ingredients correctly mixed and cooked, it would be SAFE to believe in that recipe; one is wrong and also probably under pressure.What was fast and smooth in the previous one, is slowed down and analyzed thoroughly from all the directions. And from this comes some of the finest tensed moments created on the screen, like sense of vulnerability or the tease of the upcoming guns-blazing and blood-dripping antic. These physical sequences are something that Sergio Leone used to rely upon, before breaking down into a big fist fight. Another major improvement is levity slipped in a scene, the one-liners are getting more sharp and gets a much bigger reaction from the audience.Also, the makers and the actors on set seems confident and in a comfortable zone, considering some of the most ridiculous and questionable scenes- the entire cultural dance and eerie controversial rituals- are pulled off with such ease and conviction. Sean Connery revisiting his character oozes, yes, sexiness, but also a calculative, ethically wrong or mislead person that gives him quite a range to cover; he cares but often it turns out to be too late. From Russia With Love is the perfect formal vacation they could color, it is polished and poised in its tone, even at its dirtiest moment, the characters have enough courtesy to keep their gloves on."

      "text": "Bond strikes againIn this film, the second of the Bond franchise, the British secret agent finds himself involved in a conspiracy of the criminal organization SPECTRE, which plans to assassinate him using a beautiful and naive Russian agent.This film is one of the few films of the early period of the franchise to focus on the reality of the secret services of the sixties: the Cold War. It is curious but only during the eighties and nineties, at a time when the USSR was agonizing, is that the Bond films will again focus more directly on the rivalry between the Soviet bloc and the Western powers. Directed by Terence Young and again with Sean Connery in the role, Bond will face and seduce Tatiana (Daniela Bianchi, another \"Bond-Girl\" that cinema forgotten after the passage by the franchise) and defeat Rosa Klebb (Lotte Lenya). Bernard Lee (as M) and Lois Maxwell (Miss Moneypenny as) also appear in the film, which is introduced one of the most popular and charismatic characters of the franchise: Q, Director of MI-6 Equipment Branch."

      "text": "The second mission of the world-famous agent of Her Majesty is posed as a big trap. James Bond has to steal a decoding machine from the hands of the Russians and is hunted at the same time by Spectre's hunters. The Orient Express then comes to a big showdown.Sean Connery embodies the British agent James Bond 007 for the second time. Connery is also more mature than the predecessor, which gives him more trade space. He is more confident and may also bring more humor.The Austrian actress and singer Lotte Lenya is also introduced as the first female villain of the Bond franchise. Even though she had little playing time in this film, she seemed very dominant and remarkably. Especially because of their glasses.The Mexican Pedro Armendariz has his last big role alongside Sean Connery. As a companion of Bond. He always stands by the hero. Armendariz died during the filming of cancer. He will remain unforgotten as a friend and helper of Kerim Bey.Red Grant is introduced here as a special stooge with specific killing agents. Grant is played by Robert Shaw. Shaw plays the mission killer of Spectre fairly cool and dry. But Bond can already reach the water.The Italian actress and model Daniela Bianchi plays the Bondgirl Tatiana Romanova. Although Bianchi was second in the Miss Universe elections, it is more noticeable because of her beauty. Acting is rather weak and is in the shadow behind Lotte Lenya.What I find very good is that Spectre already has a greater significance in the franchise. The mysterious man with the White Cat is also introduced here, which I find very exciting. One also notices that the predecessor Dr. No had a good result. This made it possible to spend more money on the second adventure. The storyline is varied and has more action than its well-known predecessor.Conclusion: A well-made and coherent agent thriller, at that time, the Cold War!"

      "text": "The first 20 minutes of the movie are spent without any true Bond action. Naturally, when we find him this time, he is with a completely different woman than when we last saw him. Although he does have his fair share of experiences with the other sex, this movie is a little more subdued than the last one. However, I will admit that the middle-of-the-film sequence and the opening credits' belly dance may have been a tad overdone. Compared to Dr. No, this movie is mostly a spy thriller. This movie, in my opinion, focused more on dramatic storytelling than it did on explosions. However, it also included one of the best battle scenes I've seen in pre-1970s movies. The train scene is brilliant beyond belief."
