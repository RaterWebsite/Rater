Luckily I was in my room when watching this sad yet uplifting tale. A very sincere and honest movie that brings ones inner emotions totally to the fore .. .. . .you could really feel Walkers rapport with the dogs which made this such a wonderful visually tangible experience."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "In 1982's exploitation/ vigilante classic Class of 1984, Roddy McDowall's character, an alcoholic biology teacher in a seriously crime-ridden high school who makes the fatal mistake of bringing his animals to class, lifts a glass to them because they're far superior to people. This exciting, masterfully manipulative and surprisingly quite moving Disney adventure epic, the best movie so far in an admittedly young 2006, certainly bears McDowall's argument out. Moreover, even though dividing the world into \"dog people\" and \"cat people\" is most of the time a little too arbitrary (I'm both), Eight Below will most likely turn even your neighbor across the street who shares her house with eighteen felines into a dog person for two hours. The title characters are a team of heroic sled dogs who are forced to tough it out in brutally cold Antarctica, braving the elements as well as imminent starvation when their masters are forced to desert them and various combinations of circumstances prevent a quick return. While the dogs protect, take care of, and sacrifice for one another, the humans (with one exception) more or less rationalize their way out of feeling much real responsibility for relieving the dogs' plight, even though one of the scientists is mostly at fault for the whole situation. Spielberg associate Frank Marshall (who dealt with somewhat similar material in Alive--which thankfully isn't resolved here with quite the same methods--and, thank God, avoids the smarmily jokey tone that made his Congo so disgraceful) does a splendid job not only of staging and filming the canine action so you feel you know almost precisely what the dogs are barking to each other and even thinking, but even does a first-class job of detailing the animals' very different and distinctive personalities. (He's also very shrewd in the way he dispenses with both the Obligatory Penguin Footage and the Obligatory Paul Walker Shirtless Scene in the first ten minutes.) The dog material is so extraordinary that it's easy to understand criticisms that there's not enough of it and that too much screen time is spent on the humans trying to get back to them, but I thought Marshall's cutting back and forth between the dogs and the people built and heightened the suspense beautifully. And then there's the matter of Walker, who plays the most guilt-ridden of the scientific team--in films like The Fast and the Furious and Into the Blue, he's one of those bad actors who's nevertheless fun to watch because he habitually races through his dialogue, but working with the pooches really seems to have altered his acting style: he slows down and gives his warmest, most relaxed and likable performance ever. It's a long-held truism in the acting community that actors should never work with animals because the humans will invariably be upstaged, but perhaps in Walker's case he should go the opposite route and do nothing EXCEPT animal movies from now on!"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "The dogs were fantasatic! If you are a dog lover, this film will touch your heart. If you are not a dog lover, you WILL be after this film! There is an amazing \"human-like\" quality among the team of dogs. The show respect, love, and compassion for each other that makes all of them simply wonderful."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This is a great movie! It moves quickly and has something to appeal to everyone. This movie relies on plot, talent, and a good ending rather than obsenity and nudity to attract an audience. Imagine that!

Three local dogs appear in the movie."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This was a really good movie, I enjoyed it."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "Paul Walker is, without a question, the worst actor in Hollywood."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Don't hate Paul Walker because he's beautiful. He has great chemistry with the dogs, though not so much with the humans."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "What can I say except the best actors in the movie were the pooches. I wished they showed more of their fight for surivival. I was impressed with the movies portrayal of these dogs as compassionate creatures. As for the humans, it may have been in part a weak script of dialogue but the acting was slightly below average. This movie had the potential to be so much more. I wish they stuck more to the actual history of the orginal true story of an Japanese outpost in the 1950's. This would have been more interesting to me but heaven forbid the masses can live without their Hollywood or Disney in this case. Overall it was not a total was of 2 hours."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "There were no bad guys, just a difficult situation. Paul Walker played a non-aggressive, but persistent character who knew what was the right thing to do and did not give up his quest. There was no subtext, but it was easy to think of one. How many people who work hard and give their all in our society are abandoned like dogs while those they help are given all the accolades?"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I could watch this movie over and over again.

Not only do the dogs deliver on their part, they somehow manage to lift Walker up so he gives a performance that isn't bad. Which when you think about it, might have been the most remarkable thing the dogs pulled off in this film. I also think the woman pilot showed genuine screen charisma."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This movie broke my heart."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "saw this movie on Delta Airlines coming back from Atlanta....so gripping, moving, didn't even feel the turbulence in the air at times....I was that engrossed.

Invest your viewing time there instead."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "I must be living in some parallel universe or maybe I love animals a lot more than most folks. **Spoiler Alert** I could not get past my extreme anger that all of those people left those dogs chained up and didn't come back to see about them for five months. The only right thing that Paul Walkers character should have done is to say \"I will get out of here when my dogs are by my side, and not a moment sooner."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Just a heart-warming movie that's a pleasure to watch. Paul Walker is excellent in this kind of role, and unlike many movies of this kind, they don't set up \"the bad guy\" like I thought they would have. And the dogs are incredible! I was a little puzzled, however, by the fact that the line from the preview that went something like: \"Don't ever underestimate somebody's will to survive...Especially when he's with his family\" (referring to the dogs) - didn't even make the final cut of the film! I kept waiting for it. just a really solid film. And to my great surpise, like in Final Destination 3, there is one jump out of your seats moment that will scare the crap out of you, so keep a solid grip on that popcorn."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Thank goodness we have a movie that teaches children that the future of our survival depends on learning from animals, not from destroying them. The animals and their trainers are the real stars of this movie. It is beautiful to witness their portrayal of teamwork, love, bravery, and devotion. We must hope that \"Eight Below\" and \"March of the Penguins\" mark the beginning of many more of this film genre."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This movie is so wonderful, yet heartbreaking, I saw it twice. The dogs will steal your heart and make you use your kleenex. I hope they all will get an Oscar, at least a special Oscar for their performances. Inspired by a true story, I understand the original ends with more heartache than this one does. Do yourself a favor and see this movie. It's one of the few wonderful family movies out there today. Thanks Disney for a job well done. P.S. Don't listen to critics degrading this film. I've learned, over time, that if critics give it a low rating, go see it, because it means it's good."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Needed more time with the dogs who were wonderful.

Highly recommended."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Don't harm the dogs, by all means, but how about a little doggie make-up that would convey the long ardurous months these canines fended for themselves. These huskies look too fresh, which dillutes the impact of the reunion considerably. Of more interest, especially in the year of the gay cowboy, is the ambiguous relationship between Jerry(Paul Walker) and Charlie(Jason Biggs). Charlie has a girlfriend that might not exist, and guess who Jerry grabs first in excitement when the gang is reassembled for the rescue mission."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "My verdict: give me more dogs, less people. The cut-aways to the people really made this movie drag. When it was focused on the dogs, however, it worked brilliantly.

Excellent work."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "I enjoyed the **** out of this film, its no cinematic masterpiece but I enjoyed the **** out of it.

It's also fun to watch with your entire family as well as that boosts up the adventurousness up."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This big budget American re-make of the Japanese \u201cAntarctica\u201d is quite special in its attention to detail and very obvious stylised production values. Director Frank Marshal pulls out all stops to bring this gripping tale to the screen through stunning photography and some strong casting \u2013 the best of these is the late, and at all times believable, Paul Walker (Flags of our Fathers \u201806) playing a guide for the National Science Foundation. He manages and nurtures the scientist\u2019s Dog Team - a mixture of Alaskan Malamutes and Siberian Huskies. These highly intelligent animals are nothing short of astounding \u2013 as seen in the remarkable performances of their highly trained duties (a testimony to their trainers).Based on the ill-fated 1958 Japanese Antarctica expedition - it\u2019s a semi-retelling of the original drama that allows more of the Dogs to survive than did originally (probably for family considerations) and takes us on a tour de force survival adventure, with some genuine shocks on the way!  Many inspirational situations help to overcome the coy addition of a comic type character in Jason Biggs but this has to be tolerated for the sake of \u2018entertainment\u2019/sales marketing - it might have been helpful to reduce this character\u2019s screen time to bring down the movies overlong running time but, this will vary with personal choice. Mark Isham\u2019s big music score is as vast as Don Burgess\u2019 inspiring widescreen photography. Strong family entertainment on the fact-based dramatic side that\u2019s curiously not run as often as it deserves. Fine DVD transfer."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "How the hell people like movie, where some **** left dogs in snow hell for so long?"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "One of the amazing remake movies.
