  "description": "Construction company owner John Matthews learns that his estranged son, Jason, has been arrested for drug trafficking. Facing an unjust prison sentence for a first time offender courtesy of mandatory minimum sentence laws, Jason has nothing to offer for leniency in good conscience. Desperately, John convinces the DEA and the opportunistic DA Joanne Keeghan to let him go undercover to help make arrests big enough to free his son in return. With the unwitting help of an ex-con employee, John enters the narcotics underworld where every move could be his last in an operation that will demand all his resources, wits and courage to survive.",

Dwayne Johnson tries to play a simple man in over his head. Unfortunately his pecs the size of the Brooklyn Bridge make it a little less convincing. Like I said not bad, but compared to the abysmal spring 2013 movie season this thing is a masterpiece!!!!"

      "text": "Let me start by saying that this is probably the best Dwayne Johnson performance in his career which is why its a shame that its in this monotonous crime thriller. Snitch is the story of what happens when John Matthews (Johnson) finds out his son has been arrested for distributing drugs. Matthews decides he must infiltrate a drug ring to bring someone to justice to truncate his sons prison sentence but this may ultimately ruin everything he has ever built. At the beginning of Snitch you are reminded that this is a film based on actual events and then these supposed real life people go on to do some of the most ridiculous things in the name of family and justice that you find it ever so hard to believe that this has any standing in reality. The film splits its time between two families, one being John's family, the other belongs to one of John's employees, Daniel (Jon Bernthal), an ex con looking for a second chance for him and his family. The film feels no desire to discuss or even talk about these characters lives or how they got to this place, instead it lets the viewer fill in the gaps thanks to vague hints dolled out in increments over the course of the film. This allows you to make your own story for them but it also changes very little to do with the film making it lazy storytelling at best. As stated above this is a film grounded by a strong central performance by Johnson but the films slow pace and nonsensical storytelling makes it impossible to enjoy as the characters don't do normal logical things and they have not really been given any character traits to suggest they might even consider doing this. The end therefore leaves you unsatisfied and if your anything like me, quite a bit confused"

I've been enjoying (and occasionally cringing at) his action movies since he started acting. There has of course been other athletes who've tried and failed at the crossover but Dwayne Johnson has come up through the ranks and has made me take notice. Strangely, I just saw 'Faster (2010)' a few days ago for the first time, and was taken aback at his rock steady performance (no pun intended) doing an hard action movie with very little dialogue and saying more in those few words than all his other films put together. It was good and he's done it again. I remember thinking similar things about Mr Marky Mark and I think Mr Wahlberg is a tremendous actor now. I just remembered, Marky and Rock (Y?) were in 'The Other Guys' together, lol. It's been directed by former stuntman Ric Roman Waugh who gave us the reasonable prison flick 'Felon'. This is a more stylish movie than his others and he seems to be one of those people who has to work hard at his job. You know the way P T Anderson or Tarantino just seem to know where the camera should go? Well most need to start small and work up so were seeing Ric Roman Waugh about a third of the way up the directing ladder. He is purty promising though.\r The bottom line is, this has some good performances, it's got a good and interesting (Susan Sarandon) cast, the pacing is not as smooth as it could be, particularly in the slow middle but it's been done on a budget of $15 million which it's just pulled back in it's first week. I guess that says it all really.  Highly Recommended  Score: 7.2/10  N\u2206V  navq@ymail.com"

That's what makes \"Snitch\" so great. Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson gives a fantastic performance, if not occasionally lacking enough emotion, and Jon Bernthal (Shane from The Walking Dead!) is fantastic. The plot is realistic and really pulls you in. As a matter of a fact the whole movie is realistic, and that's what separates it from other movies and helps keep it tense and enjoyable. It's just a fantastic movie, the casting couldn't have been better, and constantly keeping you worried that not every character will walk away is something I haven't seen in many movies. \"Snitch\" is amazing and I highly recommend it."

Barry Pepper, Susan Sarandon, and formerly of the Walking Dead John Bernthal provide a great supporting cast but The Rock leads the way in a movie about how far a father is willing to go to protect his son. I wasn't a huge fan of some of the camera work and other cinematic effects but there's nothing overdone about this film and that's actually a good thing. The story develops well and is enough to keep you engaged without the need of excessive explosions or anything else. This isn't actually an action movie and just about any other quality actor could've played the role of John Matthews but as I said, the fact that Dwyane Johnson did it well shows how far he's come. Between his role in Fast & Furious 6, his recent comeback on WWE, his new shot on TNT \"The Hero\", and this leading role, Dwyane Johnson seems to be everywhere right now but he's performed his roles well so that's not a bad thing."

      "text": "After hearing little about Snitch in the media, I wasn't sure if this was going to be a movie worth two hours of my life. As I was typing this review, I learned that the movie only made 42 million dollars in the box office. I was rather surprised by this considering Grown Ups pulled in a whopping roughly seven and a half times more than that. (300 Million)\r Snitch began showing John Matthews' (Dwayne Johnson) son, Jason Collins,(Rafi Gavron) who is agreeing to get shipped some illegal drugs and \"hold them\" until his friend can come pick them up. When the package comes, he opens it and then sees a tracker in the bottom of the box. When cops arrive he is already running away and then gets captured and goes into custody. By this time I already liked the movie because we learned what the movie was about and the problem that would try to be fixed, within the first ten minutes of the film. After meeting federal prosecutor, Caroline Keeghan (Susan Sarandon), John learns that he can try to bust other drug dealers to reduce his son\u2019s sentence.\r After getting beaten up, money stolen, and his truck almost hijacked all on the first try, he goes back to meet with Keeghan. John meets with a former gang member Daniel, who works for him at his company. Daniel agrees to help and they go to a bad part of town to begin. They meet Malik, (Michael Kenneth Williams) who does not know he is being recorded. If he gets Malik and the drugs, she will reduce Jason's sentence to two years, one year suspended. Daniel thinks this who thing is real and does not recognize John's agents trailing them.\r After John gets home for the night he has a stressful conversation with his wife Analisa. John says that \"Every move I make, or don't make, Jason will have to live with for the next ten years of his life.\" I thought this was the most powerful part of the movie. I thought about this quote for a while and think it was very important. John basically said that if he doesn't do anything, his son will be in prison for ten years of his life. If he does do something, though he is risking his life, he is helping his son get out faster. What John does impacts how Jason's life turns out. John makes an even bigger deal with Keeghan that will assure instant release of Jason with the arrest of \"El Topo\" and the drug money.\r Without giving away the rest of the movie, though I correctly predicted how it would end, I still thought it was a solid film and was very underrated. To me, it does not make sense that an Adam Sandler comedy made so much more than a high end action thriller with a 35 million dollar budget. I thought that Dwayne's acting was top notch in this movie and he was the perfect person to play the father. I was reluctant to see Snitch but am glad I took the time and thought the film paid off."

      "text": "There were a number of moments in this movie during which I was shaking my head due to their complete implausibility (one particular incident that comes to mind is a highway chase during which a man fires a shotgun one-handed out the window of an 18-wheeler truck while remaining in perfect control of the vehicle), but its quiet, intense handling of the subject matter and powerful performances are just enough to elevate it above typical action fare. Dwayne Johnson is always entertaining to watch on screen, but this was the first time (in a serious movie, at least) that I felt totally engrossed by one of his performances.To me, Mr. Johnson is a criminally under-appreciated actor, especially considering he has no formal training as one: you could count his WWE theatrics as \"acting experience\", I suppose, but peers of his from that world (*cough cough* John Cena *cough cough*) have also attempted the transition with far less success. This tells me that his natural charisma and talent for the trade far outweighs his lack of experience (something that, unfortunately, the films he appears in tend to coast on due to lousy screenwriting and not-always-so-amiable co-stars), something I had suspected for a while but was finally confirmed with this film. As John Matthews, he isn't a bounty hunter, or a CIA/Special Forces operative with a tortured past, or a Diplomatic Security Services agent firing a minigun in the middle of a city street (*cough cough* Fast and Furious *cough cough*)--he is an ordinary man caught up in an extraordinary situation (the movie also understands that even for someone with muscles on their muscles, four on one is a tough fight).John's estranged teenage son Jason (Rafi Gavron; also, three cheers for the overused plot point!) is somehow convinced by a friend to take possession of a huge bag of drugs for the weekend, only to promptly be arrested in a DEA sting operation. With a minimum sentence of 10 years, the overeager district attorney (Susan Sarandon) informs John that the only way to spare Jason the prison life already taking its toll in the form of frequent beatings and abuse is by helping her fry a bigger fish. Time for a convenient plot point? I think so! One of the workers at John's construction company (Jon Bernthal) is an ex-con trying on behalf of his wife and son to lead a clean life, but is eventually persuaded by John to start introducing him to and setting him up with first local drug dealers (Michael Kenneth Williams) and eventually big-time cartel players (Benjamin Bratt). Now, it's in segments like these that this film goes beyond implausibility and takes a nose-dive straight into absurdity. John's main argument for why these hardened criminals should trust a straight-laced, ordinary guy like him is that he owns a legitimate business and the trucks utilized by his construction business carry too much freight to be properly searched. In that case, couldn't the cartels just buy a bunch of trucks and load them up with cheap and useless crap that can serve as a cover for the drugs? How no one had thought of this earlier in this movie is astounding to me. Additionally, what kind of shady, underground drug dealing world is this that people just trust outsiders implicitly because of one successful run? The escape from the rival cartel was impressive, sure, but new initiates don't just make leaps and bounds within a criminal organization like that. Any gangster will tell you, that s**t takes time.As compared to other \"true stories\", however, the story is fairly solid, and elevated far above the bar set by similar films with its committed, natural performances. Sarandon and Barry Pepper are good as the district attorney and the DEA agent acting as John's handler, Bernthal makes his Daniel character sympathetic and likable enough to make a blip on the radar as what could have been a stock character, and though dipping a bit deep into \"whiny teen\" territory (Hollywood would have you believe that there's only two ways to play teenagers on the silver screen these days: as spoiled brats and wise far beyond their years. There is no in-between.) Gavron makes us genuinely care what happens to Jason. The standout, as I said before, is Johnson, whose stoic determination and somewhat angry yet urgent calm captures the essence of a father willing to do whatever it takes for his son.In short, while by no means a masterpiece it is entertaining enough to warrant the DVD purchase if you're a fan of these types of movies (if you need some more examples, \"Savages\" and \"Contraband\" are the two that come to mind). It's also worth checking out simply to see Dwayne Johnson at his dramatic best, even if he is let down by the averageness of the movie. 7/10"
