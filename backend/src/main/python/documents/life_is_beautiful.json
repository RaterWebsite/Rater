His sense of humor was entertaining and the love he had for his wife and son was unbelievable.  His personality made for an amazing movie.  Guido reminded me of Vladek from Maus in the way that he was always trying to get out of the Holocaust alive, unlike some people who let themselves die. Just like Vladek, he was so incredibly in love with his wife and son and did anything it took to keep them alive."

This is because the Main Character Guido (Bengini), plays his role very as a clown trying to protect his son from the horrors of the holocaust. This does not give the appropriate respect the for people affected by the Holocaust. Joshua plays an excellent roll as a innocent child blind from the Horrors of the Holocaust. I would recommend this to my family because it gives the respect it deserves to Holocaust survivors while at the same time Guido makes it a comedy. When Joshua is hiding in the metal box and Guido is being taken by the SS officer he does a funny march protect Joshua from what is really going on."

The story is terrible and dull whereas the characters in this film disrespected the reality regarding the treatment of the Jews. It makes no sense from the story line whatsoever and Robert Bengini made the theme cheerful and hopeful which doesn't seem to add well for a movie to be based on a WWII and Holocaust setting. Even though it's presented on a matter of fiction but reflects the reality of the event, It's a bad movie that you shouldn't watch. Steven Spielberg's \"Schindler's List\" will always be the truly emotional and superior film based on the events that happened in the Holocaust. Why? because it's a Spielberg film and he does not disappoint and the fact he comprises reality more than fiction. Unlike Roberto Bengini, he is disrespecting the theme by creating a film that is presented in a cheerful matter and thinking that it's best to add a level of inconsistency  to the story line."

Once there the main characters happy fairy tale is over, and he is separated from his princess.

      "text": "The first half of Life is Beautiful is a romantic comedy, it presents itself as somewhat of a live-action cartoon. It has a ton of slapstick humor that you would expect from the Looney Tunes. The second half, however, is simply, a father trying to protect his son from the reality of the situation. Guido (Benigni) pulls of ludicrous stunts, just so his son doesn\u2019t find out they are in a concentration camp. The idea of the film isn\u2019t to tell a real serious Holocaust story, the camps are more of a backdrop for the real story. As I said before, the treatment of the camps is treated as somewhat of a joke. Guido and his son are able to contact Dora (Braschi) over the loudspeakers and not be caught or killed. Conversely, in the novel Night, Elie Wiesel sees Idek, Wiesel\u2019s superior, with a polish girl. Wiesel receives 25 lashes on his back. If you want a realistic interpretation of the Holocaust then this film is not for you, but if you want a heartfelt story about a father willing to do anything and everything for his son, I would recommend this film to you."

      "text": "Life Is Beautiful truly shows why life is beautiful. A film about the Holocaust, the film shows how one man's energy and passion for life can shield his young son from the atrocities surrounding him. The film toes the line between tragedy, comedy, and romance, throughout, but knocks all of them out of the park. It is heart warmingly funny and Roberto Benigni has an absolutely irresistible charm that almost distracts the viewer from the horror they are watching. The romantic element is touching and brilliantly executed (it also has the best non-sex sex scene, I've seen). Finally, the tragedy is hard-hitting. This film will truly break your heart and those last 20 minutes are guaranteed to at least leave you on the brink of tears. As a whole, Life Is Beautiful is a wonderful film that differs from other Holocaust films in that it brings some a different human element to the table, other than despair. Rather, it injects an adrenaline shot of hope and optimism that is largely unmatched in film."

      "text": "In the tragic, but comic movie called \u201cLife is Beautiful\u201d directed by Roberto Benigni shows the life that people lived when the holocaust was happening. The movie takes a tragic event that happened in our history and twists it to seem comical and happy but shows what they had to go through and what they did to elderly people and children. I didn\u2019t expect some things that happened to happen. I thought that when the guard took Guido and we heard the gun shot that he had stolen the gun from the guard and shot him. The movie take twists and turns to throw viewers off and think something else is going to happen. This movie makes the holocaust seem like it is not all bad and it lightens it up a bit when thinking about the holocaust and what they put them through. It shows that even something as tragic as the holocaust can still be portrayed as a comic and happy story. It takes all the bad out of what happened and brings out the good and hopefully puts in the back of your mind that it happened but we can make sure that nothing like this will ever happen again. In the end of the movie, it shows that with all the events Joshua had to go though, from hiding from Nazi\u2019s to knowing his father was killed, he still can have a happy ending to a movie. After reading the book \u201cMaus\u201d and watching this movie, they have similarities that the characters go though. \u201cMaus\u201d shows more tragedy then the movie and it is more straight forward with what happened then the movie is. It\u2019s makes it more difficult to read because it shows a lot more tragedy then the movie does. They both are showing the same story but in different ways so we can see how different people lived during the holocaust. Overall, The movie made something so tragic into a comedy and helped people understand that even though this event was very tragic on our history we can still get something good out of it."

      "text": "(CONTAINS SPOILERS)\r Many people who have written reviews for this movie say that it is \"abhorrent\" to make a movie about something as horrifying as the Holocaust, and that it is cheesy in every way. These reviews, especially written by critics couldn't be more wrong. This movie is about kindness and showing humility in a time of evil. The main character Guido and his son Joshua are taken the concentration camps because they are Jewish along with Guido's own father, and his wife, Dora, hops on the train because she cannot bare the idea of them suffering while she gets to live in her home. Guido knows to some extent what's in store for them, yet he neglects to tell his son because he wants Joshua's innocence to remain in tact. He wants to protect Josh because the innocence of a child is the one thing that can give light in times of darkness. Guido tells Joshua that instead of being sent to the camps and being tortured, they are participating in a tough competition, now as I said, Guido tells him this to protect this little child's innocence. Joshua is a little child and he is not yet ready to understand how their world works. This movie is about finding the light in even the darkest of times and staying true to yourself no matter what life throws at you. Yes, this movie dramatizes the camps, yet we are still able to see the cruelty of the Nazis. Guido keeps his comedy going to bring life and happiness to his son to the very end. He ends up sacrificing himself for Dora and Joshua, and even makes fun of the Nazi walking him to his death in front of his hidden son. The children are our future an they need to be protected, that is what this movie says. Yes, it is dramatized, yes it is a bit romanticized but what movie isn't to a certain extent? This movies still shows how good humanity can be. This is a movie I highly recommend. It does not deserve the rating it received."

      "text": "While this film tells a touching story, its comedic effects, oversimplifying nature and dramatic processing undermine historical accuracy severely. Its portrayal of interwar Italy is mostly idyllic, showcasing stately architectures and carefree people. Paying little heed to profound political, social and economic problems in interwar Italy, Life Is Beautiful indicates antisemitism as the sole reason for the rise of fascism. In reality, fascism came to Italy 4 years after the end of Great War. In light of unstable constitutional monarchy and fragmented political parties, the chief agenda of National Fascist Party of Italy included expansion of Italian territories. The most serious problem of Life Is Beautiful, however, is its misleading representation of concentration camps. Virtually no one sheds blood in the film, the greatest horror being a blurred version of piled bodies. The film leaves the audience with such an impression that the imprisoned merely suffered from doing heavy physical labors. In reality, however, in an environment where lack of food and water was common and any negligence could cause public punishment, the imprisoned were deprived of human dignity (Levi, 1986, p. 47, p. 117). Holocaust memories apparently contradict with the movie plots that Guido and Joshua are in good spirit and that Guido often disrespects the officers. Overall, Life Is Beautiful compromises historical accuracy for a simple story and a clear moral message. Just as the opening line states, \u201clike a fable, there is sorrow; like a fable, it is full of wonder and happiness,\u201d this movie reduces history to a lighthearted fable. It may be educational or inspirational, but the misrepresentation of interwar Italy and concentration camps reveals historical ignorance and cultural insensitivity."

      "text": "The film Life is Beautiful is a well-thought-out film. The actors in the movie were great. For example, the wife (Dora) was an amazing caring wife and mother. She was not Jewish and was willing to go to the concentration camps just to be with her family. Giorgio Cantarini is just a little boy who really pulled off the role of Joshua. Yet, considering that some parts of the movie is not historically accurate and has a little too much humor, I would not suggest this movie to others if they were going to watch it to learn about the Holocaust. An example of too much humor would be when the father (Guido) was marching around being silly in front of his son, but the next thing that happened was his death. However, if people want an idea of the Holocaust without any gory scenes or anything scarring I would suggest this movie."

Sense like what did the Nazi do when they first came here and how did they get them to more to constrain camps. I feel that the movie was just was just a joke because it seems like the Guido took something as a joke but some part should help just to keep his kid safe. It felt like the Jew were only in the Holocaust for like 2 weeks."

Even though Joshua knew that they weren\u2019t going someplace that was nice, he played along, hoping that everything would be fine. Still, Guido, the father, did the right thing by not telling Joshua the truth. Joshua probably wouldn\u2019t take it well if Guido told him that they were in a concentration camp. By not telling him the truth, Guido protected him from the horrors of the camp."

Some Italians harassed the Jews that lived in Italy; they did horrible acts to their families. The Italians thought they were the superior race, and they did not compare themselves to others like the Germans. In the movie, the people of Italy were living the good life because they had an alliance with the Germans. So they gathered up all the Jews and put them in a cattle car that could only hold 50 people but the Nazis put a hundred in one cattle car. Overall, I would recommend Life is Beautiful to people who love any kind of history. This movie goes into detail of the Holocaust and shows you how it was for the victims."

Guido ends up marrying Dora, and they have a son together, Joshua. Guido is Jewish, but Dora is not. On Joshua\u2019s birthday, Guido and Joshua were forced to get on a train to a concentration camp. Guido was confused but had a simple idea of what was happening. To Joshua, it was just a game to win points, and you win a prize. Dora found out where her husband and son were going and wanted to sacrifice her life to go to the concentration camps, but again she was not Jewish. I would rate this movie a 7 or 8 and would recommend it because it is a good quality movie; it does have some laughter, but that\u2019s not a bad thing. I know this is a serious event that had happened, but it is good to get a laugh and be blessed this is no longer going on.

Crafted by Italy's top comedian and most popular filmmaker Roberto Benigni. Guido, a Jewish bookseller, who marries his dream girl and lives the fantasy life with a son Joshua,  Although the movie was about the holocaust, that was surprisingly not the point at all. In-fact Roberto does very well at softening the impact of the holocaust.The first half of the film has nary a mention of Jews or war, we wouldn\u2019t even suspect Guido as Jewish This movie was about sacrifice, hope and a loving passion.  Benigni   provides a most stunning example of precisely the sacrifice a parent is capable of making for their child in the gloomiest of hours. at the end Joshua narrates that this was his father's gift to him. in relation to a book called Maus by Art Spiegelman, tells a graphic novel story about his father and his sacrifices in the holocaust, on the flip side this is a son's gift to his father. the book parallels some of the same cinematic understanding of character relationship ratio. This is where character are placed strategically on screen. and simple dry humor.  like the book Maus this movie also has a good balance of humor to dismal ideas. Life is beautiful is an inspiring movie that makes you wonder of all the things you have and shows you not to take it for granted   the teachings and moral implications of this movie go beyond the Cliche story line and finds a way to deeply connect with viewers."

      "text": "With an award winning film with a whole different perspective on what the Holocaust looked like, Roberto Benigni brings out the best in him even in the darkest hours of human history. A fresh and different look at the Holocaust captivates the audience and I in a way that isn\u2019t determined by eye-candy or flashy action scenes. Life is Beautiful is one for the masses to definitely watch.\rTaking place in Italy, Guido, a happy-go-lucky kind of man is happily traveling across Italy, and bumps into his future wife, Dora. As time goes on they get closer and eventually have a son. Once Germany starts its warpath however, Guido and his family\u2019s life takes a dark turn as the Nazi\u2019s begin to round up Jews and enemies alike. Guido and his family struggle through hardship and strife as they try to survive the hellish world of the Holocaust. However, the movie isn\u2019t as serious and dark as one would think a Holocaust film would be. Roberto Benigni\u2019s comical character comes into play throughout the whole movie, not disappointing any audience wishing to see his funny side.\rThe comedy of the movie was splendidly executed at the right times without much overextension or too much visible effort. Guido\u2019s entertaining personality is both a treat to the audience and to the movie itself, with Guido providing perfect synergy with the rest of the cast. With the cast and characters, the development of some characters were slow as they didn\u2019t have much screen time in the movie, such as Dora, but in the end, the movie gives a good feel of all the characters\u2019 personalities.\rThe real shining star of this movie was the relationship between main characters, Guido and his son Joshua. In the worst times of their life, Guido somehow manages to persuade his infant boy that they\u2019re actually playing a game, with the reward being a military standard tank. Knowing that the Holocaust will heavily affect Joshua if he gets out of their situation, Guido entertains his son with his lighthearted humor and with the promise of the tank, while keeping his son\u2019s life and mentality intact. This unbreakable bond between father and son showcases how well Roberto used his character to work with Joshua, allowing the directing, writing and acting to really shine out.\rWhile how the movie actually plays out and presents the predicaments of each character may seem a bit far-fetched, it still is an unforgettable movie. A man that risks everything for his family in the worst of times and somehow making some comic relief is a hard piece of chemistry to get right, yet Roberto pulled it off nearly flawlessly. Life is Beautiful does indeed show that life truly can be beautiful like the film itself was."

All other critic sites award this film with high scores and pleasant words, hailing it as a masterpiece. Life is Beautiful, or La Vita E Bella, is the highest grossing Italian movie of all time, and with good reason. This film is tragic, emotional, dark, but also funny, optimistic, and filled with wonder. Many people who have problems with the film argue that it makes fun of the horrors of the Holocaust, making the event appear not as impactful or terrifying as it really was. The film appears to do this because of the father's imagination and the stories he tells his son to avoid revealing their true situation and scaring him. The focus of the film is not the Holocaust, a concentration camp doesn't even appear until halfway through the movie. Yes, Life is Beautiful has several scenes that focus on the Fascist Regime, the Nazis, and the horrific things that happened at the camps, but the story and the charm of the film come from the family. The focus is the love between the father and his wife and son and how imagination and optimism can conquer fear. The emotions in the film are too real and the characters so endearing that it is impossible to dismiss the film because of it's \"inaccuracies\". Those who wrote the reviews to give the amazing feature a measly 59 must be out of their minds to ignore the power and wonderful themes of Life is Beautiful. Life is Beautiful is a movie about how life is beautiful, through the powers of love, compassion, creativity, and family. Those who can't appreciate that about this film are really as dark and depressing as the Holocaust itself."

Most people that defend the movie have to approach it from some a juvenile direction that it becomes comical in and or its own right.If you where going for a comedy based in the time period.. It's not that you can't do it. (It would be VERY HARD) But as a example, blazing saddles straddles that line pretty well.But this goes far beyond that making it clear that oh no, the holocaust is totally going on in the background, but we want to you feel warm and fuzzy.I normally don't go this far but.If you like this movie, you should feel bad about yourself.Your stupid and you fell for emotional manipulation."

      "text": "This tragicomedy film is about the efforts of a Jewish Italian, Guido, to deal with anti-Semitism and the persecution of the Jews without his son was aware of the cruel reality in which they live. Directed and written by Roberto Benigni, who also plays the lead role, also has the participation of Nicoletta Braschi and Giorgio Cantarini.We all know the barbarism that was the Holocaust. This film addresses this issue and how the Italian Jews were involved in the process. The script is good and addresses a serious topic in an unpretentious and elegant way, using an intelligent and deeply human form of comedy to touch the audience. The characters are moving, particularly Guido and his son. Benigni shone with a performance at the highest level. The soundtrack, signed by Nicola Piovani, was excellent, maybe one of the best soundtracks of that decade. The film received three Oscars (Best Foreign Movie, Best Leading Actor and Best Soundtrack) and conquered the critics and the public in Europe and U.S. This is a touching and poignant film, which shows the human need to survive to the worsts disasters and always have at heart the living flame of hope. Undoubtedly, its one of the most beautiful and relevant films of the contemporary Italian cinema."

This movie just does everything so right and I don't know why it got a ridiculously low score on metacritic. Anyways, I highly suggest this film even to those who aren't interested in Italian movies.10/10"

But I didn't mind that, or rather this isn't my main issue which is the second act and most of the third act are way more serious, because this is when the tone of the movie changed to be dark comedy, and that, of course, made the movie inconsistent in tone. Nevertheless, the movie became way more powerful as a dark comedy, and allows Benigni's clever and deft direction, and Oscar-winning performance, to shine even more. This is when the movie tug at my heartstrings, and became very devastating till its end that is as sweet as a disney movie as it is wrenching as a usual holocaust movie. Even the dialogue became more smart and touching. And let's not forget the beautiful cinematography, and Nicola Piovani Oscar-winning score.(8.5/10)"

      "text": "The movie Life is Beautiful is moving story. I rated it an eight out of ten because Guido (Benigni) was inspirational by making light of a difficult situation for his son (Joshua). The setting of the movie was in Italy during the Holocaust. Guido, a Jewish man, married a non-Jewish woman (Dora). After they got married they had a son named Joshua who is half Jewish. The father and son were forced on a train to a concentration camp where their lives were in jeopardy. Dora was not forced to the camp, however, she willingly went to be with her family. Dora (the mom) was not able to reunite with her family because she was separated when she got there. Guido played a game with his son to help him survive the camp. Even though Guido faced traumatization, he still smiled through these difficult times. When you watch the movie Life is Beautiful viewers feel compassion for Guido as he tried to make the situation better for his son. This movie did not show the horrific scenes and killings that occurred during the Holocaust. Instead, it enlightened the viewers to see the courageous side of the Jews. Overall, the movie describes the journey on how the family tries to survive the Holocaust. I would recommend this movie to anyone who finds history interesting. Life is Beautiful is enjoyable because I admired the family relationship between Guido and Joshua. The book Night was similar to the movie since in both the father and son experienced the journey and struggles of the Holocaust together. If you have not seen the movie it is important you do because it is life changing."

      "text": "Life is Beautiful, directed by Roberto Benigni, stars himself, Giorgio Cantarini, Nicoletta Braschi, Horst Buchholz and other Italian stars.I personally would rate the movie a 8.5/10; for the reasons of, that it poked \u201cfun\u201d at the Holocaust, furthermore the story died out after a while, and the language barrier, with the technology that we have today as a human society (since its on an online video provider) it should have at least been translated/revered into English but the subtitles were ok and pushed the story-telling. I would recommend this movie to someone who has some knowledge of the Holocaust and the Pact of Steel which makes Italy a Nazi/Aizs country under Benito Mussolini (who was \u201cfriends\u201d with Hitler)."
