It makes no sense,It has no internal consistency and it answers none of the questions it asks of itself. I'm pretty confident no one in the production has any idea what the robots of today are capable of, let alone the robots of 15 years from now. And speaking of 15 years from now, 15 years from now? Really? This is destined to be one of the most forgettable movies you will, I hope, never see."

What is the benefit if a robot with a personality teaching a drone pilot about the results of their actions. Its retarded.

This man is a psychopath.Nonetheless, Harp rapidly evolves from being a remorseless psychopath into being a giant hypocrite. Leo, being a very funny and likable character, drives home some good points about the US' flaws and its mistake in creating AI. When the US kills foreigners, it's called Collateral Damage. When US soldiers or citizens are killed, it's called evil and a massacre. And by the end of the movie you'd wish that this bittersweet truth would become reality. But no, they went for the cheesy happy ending. Such a shame. Nonetheless, i was thoroughly entertained and captivated by the action, the moral dilemma's and interesting topics. I give this movie an 8/10."

The premise is reasonable, but not original, just another Frankenstein; man vs his creation and the moral dilemma therein, although in this case the focus is switched to the future of humanity, rather than that of the monster. Unfortunately the plot sets this scenario up with so much potential to do something different from the traditional, binary choices of monster overcomes man or man overcomes monster, with all that these cliched outcomes imply, and then drops the ball in the final minutes, simply repeating so many dated works that have gone before; Monster = bad. Disappointing."

And while it's true that this film never tries to make you believe that it is more than what it shows, it's also a bit disheartening how disposable these productions become in a world saturated with options.If you don't demand much and just want to entertain yourself for a bit, you may find it more useful than me. Otherwise you're ok looking for better alternatives."
