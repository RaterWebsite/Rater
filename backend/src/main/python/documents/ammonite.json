  "description": "In 1840s England, palaeontologist Mary Anning and a young woman sent by her husband to convalesce by the sea develop an intense relationship. Despite the chasm between their social spheres and personalities, Mary and Charlotte discover they can each offer what the other has been searching for: the realisation that they are not alone. It is the beginning of a passionate and all-consuming love affair that will defy all social bounds and alter the course of both lives irrevocably.",

      "text": "Tried to be Portrait of a Lady on Fire, Failed even to become Ammonite.The great chemistry makes the best seconds of this film between Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan. But those seconds are lost in a bad script that doesn't know how to make a believable relationship."

      "text": "Kate Winslet plays a sullen fossil hunter on the cloudy coast of 1840s Lyme, England. Saoirse Ronan is the young woman who comes to the sea for convalescence. After a halting start, their relationship becomes intense and somewhat explicit for an art film. Winslet maintains a dour demeanor throughout (hardened like the rocks she studies), while Ronan manages to evolve her character. Pensive shots of shells and bugs are peppered throughout the deliberately-paced drama. While there\u2019s potential for period beauty and passion, there would have been more opportunity for emotional effect if the pacing wasn\u2019t so introspective."

      "rating": "4",
      "text": "For a romance story, this was very emotionless, and the way in which it forces that same romance can't avoid to show the thinness of the narrative.Certainly both actresses try to do the best they can with the script that was provided to them and they're the primary reason why people should give this film a shot, but even the way their romance ''blooms'' feels as a consequence of their own boredom, and if they reach that point as a repercussion of their situation, as a viewer it will be very hard to be interested in their emotions. It's inevitable, but undeserved, to compare it to Portrait of a Lady on Fire, but if you want a better film about a romance between two women, or a romance in general, you better watch that one if you haven't already."

      "text": "\"Ammonite\" \u00e9 um filme que, assim como o extinto molusco que originou seu t\u00edtulo, exige tempo. \u00c9 sens\u00edvel e pede sua imers\u00e3o. As atua\u00e7\u00f5es n\u00e3o poderiam ser melhores. Kate convence qualquer um com seu jeito 'carrancudo' e, claro, destaque para Saoirse Ronan, que precisou mudar a personalidade da personagem ao decorrer e fez isso sem brutalidade.  Ah, vale destacar, tamb\u00e9m, o excelente trabalho de som. \u00c9 espetacular ver cenas das atrizes em um c\u00f4modo fechado e o som do mar suavemente ao fundo. Apesar dos pontos positivos, acredito que h\u00e1 um limite de qu\u00e3o aberto pode ser um final, e esse abusou. Al\u00e9m das ineg\u00e1veis semelhan\u00e7as no roteiro com \"God's Own Country\", filme anterior do diretor. Mas, vale cada segundo."

      "text": "In this 1800s period piece, Kate Winslet stars as a fossil merchant who strikes up an unlikely and passionate romance with a married young woman (Saoirse Ronan). It's pretty straightforward and seems to borrow heavily from other lesbian-themed films, so there's nothing really new here or much to remark on in terms of story. Most of it just felt very underwhelming to me, and the ending felt rushed and a little too sentimental. Aside from some occasional beautiful cinematography, the biggest praise I can pay this film is the onscreen chemistry between Winslet and Ronan. Them and their performances are stellar and felt very genuine and heartfelt. Otherwise, this film is overall pretty by-the-numbers in terms of period and forbidden romance films."

      "text": "This is a somewhat slow, plodding type period drama film, or a period bio film perhaps as I'm not sure it'd be fair to call it an outright drama film. I liked the landscape cinematography (at least it shows the seaside setting in all its often dark and windswept glory) and it certainly gives the viewer something of an insight into Mary's life. I'd have liked to have seen more of her on her fossil hunts and perhaps even hearing a bit more of the science behind that side of things but I realise the focus or emphasis is almost entirely on the relationship between Mary and Charlotte. To be fair, the two main actresses (or should I/we refer to them as actors nowadays?), i.e. Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan, do gives fairly solid performances, I wouldn't downplay that but I suppose there was a slightly awkward sense (or I felt so anyway) in how understated it was, with a distinct lack of dialogue in some scenes. I suppose there is a sense of atmosphere present, so that's certainly something.Its an interesting film but not an especially memorable or thought provoking film. Its worth seeing if you know the story and are interested in how it's depicted but I'm not certain I can say you wouldn't be, if partially, disappointed, as I did feel it didn't quite entirely work, hence I wouldn't expressly recommend it, no...but I'd say its worth seeing for the cinematography and acting regardless."
