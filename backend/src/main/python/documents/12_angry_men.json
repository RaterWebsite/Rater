I wish I can bring up every single actors name in this cast but I'm not since these 12 of them and it's going to take up the all page and I can't talk about every singe actor and go into detail about them one at a time, but I can say that everyone in the movie did a flawless work of acting that's pure Oscar worthy and the kind of drama acting they should show kids in drama school. Nicely done fellas.Sidney Lumet directed this movie and this has to be some of the best directing I've seen from this guy. He really added a lot to this movie when it came to story and characters and the back and forward they have with each other and it worked by his direction.The characters in the movie (The Twelve Angry Men) don't really like each that much as in every scene they at each other's throat trying to confidence the other men in the room that the man is guilty for murder while that person and the other's bring up some really solid points that this man is guilty or not guilty for murder. As a viewer myself I got really interested in the case and trying to think if he's guilty or not, so this movie does a fantastic job of giving the viewer a opinion on the case and see if you think he did it or not.For problems with the movie: I don't have any.Overall 12 Angry Men is such a classic movie with excellent performances from everyone, the writing outstanding and the directing was some of the best. You haven't seen 12 Angry Men then I say go see it, it's worth your time."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Despite the fact that \u201812 Angry Men\u2019 was produced near 60 years ago, the messages it conveys is very much relevant to today\u2019s world and society. It gives a lot of food for thought regarding issues of prejudice and is a prime example as to how a negotiation should and should not be done. My main take away from this film would be the importance of keeping an open mind when approaching people and issues. We need to be constantly be aware of our own personal bias and think critically, never taking things at face value. Through this process, we can then be more enlightened and make wiser decisions and opinions."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "A movie with a great message.

Cobb steals every scene (and that is not easy to do in a film like this). Ed Begley, Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, Jack Klugman, Joseph Sweeney, E.G.

It showed how hostile a jury can be even when evidence may seem so true, every angle must be examined. I loved how some of the jury members would actually get so angry to the point that they would end up committing a murder! Throughout the entire movie you were just on your seat for what shocking new evidence or a point of view would change the minds of each jury member.

On the surface it is about 12 jurors that are counseling about a verdict in a murder case. On the inside it is as much about the jurors themselves, justice, life philosophies, psychology, group dynamics and responsibility. The whole movie takes place in just one room. There are no distractions and each misstep would hurt this movie badly. This is the ultimate strength of this movie. There are no mistakes, out of character moments, bad dialogues, wasted scenes or other errors. The cast and the acting is so close to perfection as possible. Each juror delivers his role in such a genuine way that I cant find a single flaw in this movie. If I praise the actors I must also praise the director Sidney Lumet. He should definitely have gotten more Oscars in his career (He made many great movies).  I want also to mentioned that I first watched this movie when I was 12 or 13 years old just by zapping trough the channels. This was something that shouldn't work at this age. I stopped zapping and started to watch this movie with fascination. As I got older it got even better as I did understand many things more with my additional life experience.

It is 12 different men with different outlooks on life being isolated in a confined space having to use the English language as a mean to compromise and persuade one another during a murder investigation for 90 minutes. Yes. Yet it's one of the most riveting movies I've ever seen, few movies have had me this invested. Seeing our main character, played brilliantly by Henry Fonda, at the start of the movie being completely alone voting against the execution one by one convincing the 11 other men to vote the same as him is an experience I think everyone should experience. During the final act I lost count of how many times I said \"This **** guy\" out loud. A very solid movie choice for a first black and white experience.
