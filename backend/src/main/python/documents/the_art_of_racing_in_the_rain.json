It could have been any other actor and it would hardly have made any difference."

YOU'LL THANK ME LATER  :)"

Para mi es de las mejores del 2019 sin duda alguna."

While it definitely has it's flaws, \"The Art of Racing in the Rain\" injects meaningful life lessons into this formulaic tear-jerker. If you've ever loved a pet dearly, this movie is for you"

      "text": "I don't think the negative reviewers here ever read the book, so if they didn't you can't take much heed in their comments. The film actually follows inline with the book quite well.  I really appreciate the fact that it doesn't divert from the original story, unlike my favorite book, \"Ready Player One\".  That movie was a bit of a train wreck for me and I really love SciFi and gaming. I only reserve a 10 for exceptional movies that really leave me remembering scenes or lines like Shawshank.  The film will probably leave you emotional, but a good movie can do that."

      "text": "Framed from the point of view of man's best friend, The Art of Racing in the Rain is a pretty good movie about a man fighting for his family.  The framing device reflects similar movies, such as A Dog's Journey, and - as with that one - is only used to set an outsider's perspective for the actual story.This movie may be better suited for a direct-to-video release, but it was definitely worth the price of the ticket.  The narrative was pretty straight-forward if a bit thin, and it's that thinness that keeps it from pushing past \"pretty decent\" and into greatness.Worth the watch, but probably won't be all that memorable afterwards."

      "text": "I hadn't read the book that it is based on, so only armed with the knowledge of a short synopsis, I really didn't know what to expect. It was actually quite good.I thought listening to Kevin Costner drone on for a couple hours as a dog's inner monologue would be tedious, but the nuggets of wisdom peppered with the occasional witticism provided ample entertainment. I often felt like I was watching the \"Thoughts of Dog\" Twitter account played out in cinematic form. I absolutely loved both Milo Ventimiglia and Amanda Seyfried in this. The daughter was also played especially well by Ryan Kiera Armstrong. The relationships between themselves and also with Eve's (Seyfried) parents was perhaps a bit banal at times, but overall was still believable and endearing - although I felt like hitting the dad with my car at several points.Afterwards, I overheard several people tell the studio rep that they hadn't expected the movie to be a \"tear-jerker\", and the sobs coming from the gentleman seated next to me seemed to confirm that. However, I found the story to not be overly sorrowful or sad, but inspirational. A guide, if you will, for how to become an exemplary person shown through the filter of a dog's belief that by gaining this knowledge he'll be reincarnated as a human in his next life. (I know it sounds silly, but it was actually quite poignant.)"

Reflection must come at a later time.' - Enzo"

I'm not really sure why its categorised as comedy, as I wouldn't call it that, if anything its quite sobering - its more of a family friendly drama really. Its thoughtful and somewhat sentimental, cheesy and perhaps a bit predictable but mostly a good watch, so overly I'd (perhaps cautiously) recommend it, yes."
