      "rating": "5",
      "text": "This is a low budget made-for-TV type action movie. It is certainly watchable, as long as you can ignore lots of \"they would never do that\" plot conveniences. Tyrese Gibson is excellent as the lead, I would watch more of his movies, and John Malkovich is as good as ever. The lady actor in the red dress should stop \"acting\" immediately. I found it entertaining enough, with a bit better screenplay it could have been excellent for a low budget movie."
