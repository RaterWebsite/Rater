It's really mentally grathing and slow, and it may not be the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's pretty close. I know it's not about shock and more about gross out scares, but you can't really be grossed out too much if you're not immersed in the movie (maybe the infamouse \"eyegasm\", but nothing else), and this movie does nothing interesting to help itself. What little story there is the most cliched I've ever heard. I'd like to dig more deeply into it, but there is nothing there to dig into. All you have to know is that people get tortured while the audience wonders what's so great about it. This may not be a part of a genre I like, but a truely good movie could suck you in regardless of the genre. Not to get off track or anything, but a good example is, Pulp Fiction. It is listed under \"crime\", \"drama\", \"suspence\", and \"comedy\" all at once, but you don't think \"hey, I'm watching a crime/drama/suspence/comedy\", you just think \"hey, I'm watching a movie\". Hostel is so cliched that it seems like a genre template and nothing else. I read the user reviews of people who liked it in case I missed something, but the argument of \"saterizing the audiences lust for pain\" could be said for any movie in the genre. Bottom line: you can't have a gross-out movie without the \"movie\" part. I was grossed out when i stepped in dog poop, but that doesn't make it the apitamy of cinema."

Unbeknownst to them, the hostel is run by a group who mercenaries who kidnap tourists and sell them to rich people to torture for kicks. While the situation is a nightmare, the story really isn't that scary. It's bloody and very gory, but it's not going to keep you up at night. It was a good movie, I like blood and guts, but that's not how it was advertised! This was advertised as being one of the scariest movies ever and it just wasn't. If you're a horror fan, it's defiantly worth seeing, but be warned, it's more about shock and awe than it is scary."

The receptionist is a creepy nerd who keeps saying things like \"Americans? Cool! Party yes? Why not!\"\r The way that Eli Roth portrays a village in Eastern Europe can be seen as slightly racist, but in the end it creates a very nice modern, spooky fairy tale feeling.

I watched the movie after hearing and reading audience reviews but I think audience was wrong this time.The atmosphere of movie is frightening but the idea of being drugged, kidnapped, tortured, and killed by people who are paying to do it wasn't executed properly. In starting, movie looks like tour comedy like Hangover. Then movie turns into psychological torture movie and then into survival movie. The director wasn't able to blend all these qualities properly. The movie jumped from one thing to another so badly that you can't feel any emotions.The music was terrible. Movie like this needs a good background music that helps to create spooky environment but sound team did nothing good to contribute in the movie. The acting was bad, you can't connect with any of the character.Overall, would ask you to not watch this movie unless you think it looks cool to tell others that you have watched Hostel movie."

      "text": "There's a subgenre of horror known as \"torture porn.\" Popularized by the likes of the Saw series, these kinds of scary flicks are known for their emphasis on gore and extreme violence. The whole idea is for the audience to either be horrified or excited by graphic displays of gruesome deaths. Hostel is one of the more well-known torture porn horror films, and a result has a sort of stigmata attached to it. For the life of me though I can't quite tell why. For the majority of it's running time it's more a raunchy sex-comedy than a horror film. Despite having Eli Roth in both the director's and writer's chair, the movie is more tame than one might expect what with Roth's reputation and all.Two obnoxious college students and one weird drifter set off backpacking around foreign countries in search of sex. Their quest for orgasms leads them to a small town where the word on the street is that the women are hot, horny, and love men from other countries. The movie starts off just following these guys around as they party, screw, and act like dumb sex-obsessed men. Expect plenty of nudity and f-bombs, as well as those weird moments I've noticed a lot of in Eli Roth movies that don't really make any sense until they become surprisingly important to the plot later on. From there it's a weird, confusing slog through the middle until things finally ramp up again.What's most surprising about the movie is that it's not actually very gory. At least not in the way you would think. In fact most of the nasty and violent takes place off-screen. Roth pulls his punches in ways you really wouldn't expect. I'm not sure if it's because of a lack of budget or just that he didn't have the stomach when it finally came down to it, but there's only one really nasty moment in the film. Whether or not that's a good thing just comes to down to your tastes. The actual torture is brief and muted. The majority of the action comes down to a game of cat-and-mouse as we watch Jay Hernandez try to escape with his life. There's blood along the way, but this is a surprisingly tame torture porn flick.There are some clever moments in Hostel and one heck of a satisfying ending. It's pretty fun to watch the douchebags get punished for being douchebags, and there is some surprising violence along the way. The movie also isn't shy on throwing some gorgeous bare bodies onscreen as well. You're going to have to put up with some frat boy humor and a dull mid-section, but by far the most disappointing aspect of the film is that Eli Roth never takes us back to those 70's era exploitation film levels of gratuity that he's so well-known for. It may make things more watchable than they otherwise would have been, but despite easier on the eyes and stomach, there's no denying it's the one thing holding Hostel back from being something truly noteworthy. At least it's still entertaining."

      "text": "Hostel: 10 out of 10: Half Eurotrip style sex comedy (with a seventies level of nudity) and half the doctor scene from Bloodsucking Freaks, yeah I might as well stop my review right there it's a 10.\r Director Eli Roth (Cabin Fever) has scored a bull's eye simply by going back to what makes exploitation films great. Thus he produces a film that could have been lensed in the freewheeling year of 1975 rather than PG-13 stuffy year of 2005.\r The film starts with two American college students and an Icelandic hanger on enjoying some debauchery in Amsterdam. They hear about a nirvana for sex and drugs in Slovakia and they pursue it as if they were traversing the Himalayas to find Shangri-La.\r What they find is,,,, well I won't spoil it for you but they should have stuck with the marijuana brownies and overpriced Dutch hookers.\r The movie actually makes torture scenes enjoyable again. (I generally have hated the whole torture motif in modern film for example Rest Stop.) Roth unlike his contemporaries shows the gore without those annoying zooming camera tricks. The leads are unlikable in a fun rather than irritating way (not easy to do) and the film has both a wonderful energy and plentiful surprises.\r Oh and there is copious amounts of extremely well done gratuitous nudity and sadistic gore. One of the best films of 2005."

      "text": "I saw this movie a few years ago but it's one of those movies that you can hardly forget. I love horror movies, but I'm more afraid of what is cleverly suggested than with what I see explicitly. So this movie is not the kind of movie I prefer. The action revolves around a group of three North American travelers who are making the traditional backpacking trip to Europe that immense teenagers or pre-university students do. The recipe is the usual: drink, testosterone, little brain and huge desire for sex and light drugs. They go to Slovakia, where they are looking for a hostel, advertised as the ideal place to find all this, but they end up wrapping themselves in a criminal and dangerous web where they are the flies. From here, the film is basically a torture session capable of making the Spanish inquisitors want to take notes in a notepad.We can then understand that the most serious problem of this film is the absence of a credible and well-constructed story behind the horror scenes. The script is built on gore, graphic violence is an end in itself. Another problem, a direct consequence of this, is the poor construction of the characters, who are just stupid teenagers who deserve to die in the film because the public does not care about them. Never mind the names of the actors. There are no sounding names, they would not risk their career in such a movie. They are meat to the slaughter. Eli Roth, the director / screenwriter, must have a distorted conception of what horror movies are but, in any case, the film has a specific audience and Roth was entirely capable of meeting their expectations. Special and visual effects are a fundamental part of the most soulless scenes and were done with great attention to detail.This is a movie inappropriate for popcorn, as I say, for joke. It is sadistic and shocking, arresting public attention for explicit violence. It is not a movie that is suitable for most people. They would think it is too visual, too disgusting to bear. But fans of gore and pure and tough violence will love it."
