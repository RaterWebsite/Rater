The people that say all these things are people that really are not into movies, because that thing of insulting others has been the killing punch of all comic movies, all comic movies insult other people and other countries. Remember Charlie Chaplin making fun of Hitler? or Team America making fun of China? come on!!! and other dozen movies that come to my mind. Or how about the whole country making fun of their own elected president on national media (George W. Bush) because he was holding a book upside down! I say hypocrites. Leaving my aggravation aside, the movie it's just daring, very brave and smart. It's not perfect but it sure was one of the best comic movies of its time."

There is no other movie like it, and once you see it you feel the need to see it again and again. What really surprises me about this movie it that it shows the true America. My friend was laughing so hard after just 10 or 15 minutes, she spilled her drink all ofer herself. Borat is truly Baron Cohen at his best."

I hated it because it's low-grade humor: bodily function, bathroom humor; bigotry; shock-jock-type of appeal. It is reminiscent of Andrew Dice Clay and Howard Stern. It's cheap. We, as a society, can do much better, and we have in the past. I can appreciate the skill used in compiling the film for what it is, but the degrading status yet remains. There are higher forms of humor, more appropriate for humankind. Someone said it better than I can: \"A culture is only as great as its dreams, and its dreams are dreamed by artists. When the level of existence of the artist becomes impure, so becomes impure the art itself to the deterioration of the society.\""

Why pick on this tiny country and make all its citizens look like fools? He could have used a ficticious country but to denigrade this small country is wrong. The jokes were cute at first but then became painful to bear. For young males to hail Borat as a King is bad enough but to see the critics review this trash as if it were better than Gone With The Wind is a bit too much. This documentary-comedy is simply awful in my opinion and way too long. Very much forgotten after I left the theater."

Believe it or not, I actually saw this one with my parents. I remember that day it was at the cheap theatre just in case it sucked and we got our moneys worth $1 but I can never replace the time lost. To start off, the jokes weren't funny and repetitive a bad combination in my book. The running joke is that he is from Kazakhstan and doesn't know much about America which is totally ignorant because... the funny thing is.... people in Kazakhstan know more about America than Americans know about Kazakhstan. Sometimes, it seems that Ali G, pulls down his pants and shits on the culture which is as insensitive as the \"American\" culture Ali is trying to portray. After the movie I didn't even have to ask my parents what they thought, they straight up said,\" Maybe if you cut out all of the story you could have put it on a crappy version of SNL, Madtv perhaps, and spared everyone of the story.\" That was my dad... My mom,\"It seems like they put all the best jokes in the commercials, which could have been on MadTv as a fake commercial.\" And I said,\"Ya, the movie based itself on a joke that just sucked.\" And they both concluded, \"Ya, we kinda saw that, we knew it was going to suck, we just wanted to see the movie that was supposed to be revolutionary.\" (\"Ya that movie was pretty forgettable,\"... \"What movie?\" And we all laughed) that part didn't actually happen but it pretty much summed up how we felt. Its actually funny I wasn't going to see the movie until my parents took me because I didn't want to see the movie that spawned, \"High Five\", \"Great Success\", and \"Very Nice\" the phrases I heard everywhere too many times and I didn't think were funny at all. And it seemed like everyone was watching it because it was controversial. Why did I give it a 3? I think that the movie actually tried to make a good joke and completely failed in execution."

The fact is, Borat is an equal opportunity a**hole, and you cannot use his isolated attempts to goad racists as a backdrop for the whole movie, because it's not a focal point. This movie is repulsive and lowbrow-- in other words, typical American humor."

      "text": "This movie was hard to watch, not only because of some of the more rather tastless scenes, but the exposure of some of the dark and disturbing happenings and attitudes in our own country. The film had an oppurtunity to be smarter, but in this day and age where simple-minded humor is depicted because Scary Movie/American Pie types dominate, it fell flat. However, it was still enjoyable, but only as a rental. The film runs only on shock value, and once you know when things are going to happen, the feeling is gone. However, despite several leud scenes and gags about bodily waste, the most disturbing parts of the film were most of the unsuspecting victims. Several scenes (A high class southern dinner party on \"Secession Ave\"; an antique shop that is pro-Confederate; a rodeo in which much of the audience is depicted as racist; a Senator and Supreme Court Justice at a Pentacostal gathering; several schovanistic college students and expressing their views) show a darker side to American society, as well as show that Americans do not truly have a centralized culture; many of the locations and their populations vary differently, as seen in the film. Unfortunately, the film does not focus on this the way it should, instead, as stated earlier, choosing to stir up some controversey. However, the best thing about works like this is that it can really help to point out people who are unable to grasp the concept. I am not saying everyone who hates this is an idiot, some of you have very good arguments on why the film is stupid (Ray K, Morgan G). However, a lot of you should sit out on this one. And for the record, and I am suprised there are acutally people who do not know this, but Sacha Baron Cohen, the actor that plays Borat, is in fact, Jewish. Also, this movie seems a little far-fetched. Unless this film was shot after each time he paid his bail, it was most certainly staged in order to broadcast Cohen's personal views."

A few laughs arise from some of the absurd politically incorrect situations, but mostly it boils down to sub-frat boy humour about racism and fisting, or occasionally incest, with lots of dull interludes where people have pretty lame set-up jokes played on them apparently without their prior knowledge. Sacha Cohen can think on his feet as a comic actor (nothing great, but he improvises pretty well) and the character who played his Kazakhi sidekick was quite good as well. But overall the film is not that funny, and not that interesting to watch, if you want an assessment not imbued with hype. Middle America may not have seen this sort of humour before, but the rest of us have. Anyone interested to see how gauche comedy can be done with a good deal more wit and panache and genuine laughs should track down the videos of the Australian Norman Gunston shows of the 70's and 80's. There were more laughs in the ads for those shows than in the whole of Borat."
