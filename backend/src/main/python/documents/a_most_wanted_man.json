      "text": "\"A Most Wanted Man\" stars Philip Seymour Hoffman, Rachel McAdams, Robin Wright and Willem Dafoe in this intense spy thriller based on the novel by John LeCarre. The screenplay was written by Andrew Bovell, directed by Anton Corbijn and remains true to Mr. LeCarre\u2019s literary work. Knowing that this was Mr. Hoffman\u2019s last film makes the viewing bitter sweet for one watches this great actor perform as only he can and yet with the knowledge that we will never see him in anything new again.\rThe length of the film, over 2 hours, should not be a deterrent for every scene is valuable and necessary as good editing helps the viewer watch and understand this otherwise complicated plot. The film geta and deserves an 8.5"

Like I said above, we rarely get spy thriller movies like this anymore and this one definitely filled the big empty hole for this type of movie in my life. It was interesting, exciting, intense, and the perfect amount of thrill to make a money spy movie. But going back to it all, Philip Seymour Hoffman delivered as he usually does, almost bringing a tear to your eye as we now know that he leaves us with one his best performances ever."

A MUST SEE, if you like some food for your brain. The only bothersome point for me was how my old hometown Hamburg was portrayed... dirty, dreary and covered in so much graffiti that one, who doesn't know it any better, has to wonder what kind of \"dump\" this actually most beautiful, greenest, classiest and livable of all German cities is. Yes, graffiti is a problem here... but not to the extent presented in the movie with not an inch of a wall, house entrance and staircase visible without some scribble on it."

That alone is worth it, because no other films seem to get that right (John le Carre was in MI6 so maybe that\u2019s why).   But also, Philip Seymore Hoffman was amazing. His character was crazy real, and the worst/best thing about it is you kind of felt like it was really him. As one reviewer said \u201c And the two of them, actor and character, fit so tightly into that abused and collapsing body up on the screen...\u201d  which is dead on in my opinion.\r But I don\u2019t know why in the hell they cast Rachel McAdams, she\u2019s so terrible and it took me out of the film at times, not just her \"accent\" but acting as well, although it is mainly a casting problem I think. They should have cast Jessica Chastain instead like they were considering."

Incredible performance of leading actors, notably of late Philip Seymour Hoffman. What a great actor we lost recently!\r The only thing which I found somewhat annoying was that music was over-dramatic where it did not have to be.\r Otherwise, close to a perfect movie."

However, if you appreciate great acting and a slow burning, incredibly intense plot, this is the one for you. Philip Seymour Hoffman is stellar and it almost brings a tear to your eye realizing that this is his final role. Robin Wright, Rachel McAdams, and Willem Dafoe, are also all really good here, in addition to the supporting cast. It is a true actor's showcase here. The story is admittedly slow, but never ceases to be entirely engrossing and truly had me from the very beginning. It was a twisty and turny ride, especially the ending, which is fantastic and unexpected. \"A Most Wanted Man\" is a departure from the usual spy thrillers of today that seem to always involve excessive action sequences. Here, it is dialogue driven and on the back of a great script, direction, and acting, is a resounding success. I truly hope this one can get some more buzz so that Hoffman can get another Oscar nomination, because he deserves it for his work here."

It announces that the planning for 9/11 took place in Germany without interference, and this must never be allowed to happen again.\r So much for the stakes and the motivations.\r There follows a film with virtually no action and only as much dialogue as needed to advance the plot.  There's a little chit chat, some exposition, and then waiting.  Lots and lots of waiting.  We wait silently watching the characters wait silently watching other characters make up their minds.  There is one sequence which may have been 5 minutes long, with 4 of them silent.  There is a sense of things happening in real time.\r However, the longer we wait the more we learn, and the more we learn the more we care.\r Hoffman's character is the polar opposite of the bombastic CIA agent he played in Charlie Wilson's War.  Don't come expecting that, or the ripe bluster of The Master.  Everyone speaks quietly in Hamburg where the film is set, and Hoffman perhaps the most quietly, muttering in a strange Germanic accent, but also very invested, and more and more so as the story winds tighter and tighter.\r We could do worse than have this as the final performance of Philip Seymour Hoffman.  He goes out on a high note, but an understated one as well."

I also thought the entire cast gave fine performances.

Thus begins a tedious, low-key operation to discover the man's true threat. Based on a novel by John le Carr\u00e9, this is much more about patient procedure than action or chases. Every scene plays out slowly with no tension and lots of looking. Hoffman creates a mildly compelling character, but the ever-present cig and swig is an unoriginal way to signify a flawed character. There's some interesting intrigue, but the pacing is so slow that it tries your patience."

It certainly did not get positive reviews for the quality of the story, which is the single most lead footed, plodding, predictable spy story I have ever seen. I'm all for dialogue and I was glad to sit down for a spy story that would be free of the routine cliches of guns and disguises, poison pens, and so on. But I did not expect the story also to be devoid of complexity, devoid of depth of character (one of the things literary thrillers are supposed to have), devoid of surprise, and mostly devoid of suspense. After the first forty-five minutes or so I realized the movie wasn't going to go anywhere. I gave up on it half a hour before the end, but then watched the last half hour the next morning. Nothing much happened. It has about as much plot and character development in its two plus hours, as you'd expect in the first 20 minutes of any other movie.\r Yes the acting was very good and it was fun to hear a Tom Waits song at the end over the credits. But without a story acting's got nothing to do. And sitting through a whole movie for a two minute song at the end, isn't my idea of a good time."

The person I was with had not read the book. They got lost. And its easy to understand why. A lot of films these days spoon feed major plot points and throw in a reminder every 2 minutes anyway. Not this movie. However they could have done a better job adding context to key things. Like why the banker goes out on a limb for Issa. Or why the protagonists boss/competitors choose to burn him at the end. All it would take is a 30 second \"news clip.\" These were things I would not have been able to follow if I hadn't read the book. The cinematography also had a style that is a bit sloppy. Often I found myself looking for something of meaning in the background which the camera spent so much time dwelling on. Mostly there was none to be had.\rPhilip Seymour Hoffman gives an excellent performance. He looks awful. You can tell his real life drug issues are taking their toll. But it completely suits the character.\rWillem Dafoe gives an unusually nice and likable performance.\rAll in all its a good movie that could have been a great movie.

      "text": "Based on a John le Carr\u00e9 espionage novel of the same name, A Most Wanted Man follows a German intelligence officer in Hamburg  as he attempts to prevent terrorists from attacking his city. The plot is woven with many unexpected turns and relies on realism to distinguish itself from its counterparts.  This focus on realism is a refreshing change from the normal thriller template, but it in turn has its own set of drawbacks.\r The foremost of them being pacing. The film drags on at a brutal pace. Although it attempts to create slow burning tension the result accumulates to a very slow two acts. To further enunciate the pacing problem, A Most Wanted Man never feels like if failure does come much would be lost. Various scenes attempt to create feelings of tension but these are mitigated by lack of a consequence for failure. Simply put, very little seems to be on the line.\r A Most Wanted Man also has a slew of redeeming qualities. Take the late Philip Seymour Hoffman\u2019s performance for example. His chain smoking, German accented portrayal of the fictional G\u00fcnther Bachmann is both engaging and undeniably cold. His performance exemplifies true emotion and is one of the best in his outstanding career. The direction is also very polished and stylistic; and the score greatly complements the somber tone of the film.\r Although Its focus on realism slows down the pace; this gives it time to propel the emotions of its lead characters. A Most Wanted Man excels through its poor pacing to become a worthy entry in the thriller genre."

True, the business-as-usual tone sure helps establish the characters as being familiar with the world at hand, but without any urgency in almost any character within this film, there's simply nothing for me to latch on to as a viewer. Like some other recent le Carr\u00e9 adaptations, \"A Most Wanted Man\" plays things frustratingly close to the vest, with a slow-burning pot of a plot that never quite boils over into anything memorable. Sprinkle in a couple of spotty German accents here and there and you've all but lost me. Again, director Anton Corbijn may have achieved a noteworthy aesthetic here, but I'm more of a \"colorful narrative and characters\" kind of guy myself. Not necessarily a bad movie per se.

What you can call it is, a simple spy thriller with a beautiful screenplay. The performances are good. Hoffman as G\u00fcnther steals the show portraying a spy who is the brain behind everything.  He is intelligent, he is smart and sometimes he surprises you. His character is portrayed as a complex personality. You would find that spies are not always 007-ish as portrayed in the glamorous spy movies. Dobrygin plays the role of illegal immigrant Issa very well.\r The story is quite intriguing only for those who like such movies. The complex geopolitics after the 9/11 attacks has been portrayed very well. The line which will catch your attention is that everything is being done \u201cTo make the world a better place to live.\u201d And unfortunately this is also the irony which is being portrayed in the movie.

Things kick off when a young man is spotted on CCTV and recognised as the son of a dead Russian war criminal, who the authorities believe is a Jihadi sympathiser and therefore a direct threat.\rBachmann, however, is a more pragmatic man, believing that it's better to use blackmail etc (techniques he knows the German authorities can never legally condone) to get the people at the 'bottom' of the chain, to help catch and/or blackmail those further up. Bachmann recognises that his approach is disconcerting  the post 9/11 'world', especially if there's the possibility he's wrong, and the Russian is there simply to blow something up, or escape further into the West.\rWhat follows is a well conceived, two hour long, character driven thriller.\r As a film though, it's not brilliant. Based on the John Le Carre novel of the same name, it's strange that a complex novel seems unable to be turned into a coherent screenplay. It's too slow paced, there's no real drama, all the peripheral characters aren't fleshed out and, worst of all, the basic 'message' of the book (that of extraordinary rendition by the American government) is pretty much removed from the narrative. Bachmann only offering the possibility (and not using the term itself) when explaining what could happen to the Russian man if he doesn't co-operate.\r It's not brilliantly directed, the score is instantly forgettable, and the film ends without offering any rationale as to the actions of those responsible for the 'twist' at the very end.\r Disappointing film, but filled with some excellent acting performances."

Il est d\u00e9form\u00e9 par son prisme ang\u00e9liste permanent visant \u00e0 nous faire prendre des vessies pour des lanternes : \u00e0 se demander qui sont les m\u00e9chants l\u00e0-dedans si ce n'est la CIA ou les services allemands qui veulent mettre en taule les terroristes... quelle id\u00e9e franchement que de tenter d'attraper ces crevures en fait ?En tout cas, le m\u00e9chant, ce n'est pas non plus le gentil Tch\u00e9tch\u00e8ne, frais migrant tout juste arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 Hambourg, car lui est victime des Russes, c'est-\u00e0-dire de la mafia russe et des militaires russes corrompus, ce qui revient au m\u00eame (salauds de Russes, gentils Tch\u00e9tch\u00e8nes !). Comme le r\u00e9alisateur ne pouvait pas nier enti\u00e8rement les \u00e9vidences, ni ignorer le terrorisme islamiste enti\u00e8rement, il donne tout de m\u00eame le gars Abdallah qui finance via ses ONG des choses pas tr\u00e8s catholiques. Mais c'est juste \"histoire de\"...De toute fa\u00e7on, le r\u00e9alisme est ici grosso merdo tr\u00e8s discutable, voire pas vraiment cr\u00e9dible pour un euro. Ce service de renseignements allemand qui retourne le banquier et l'avocate ? une avocate qui ressemble \u00e0 tout sauf \u00e0 une avocate : j'aurais plut\u00f4t dit une p\u00e9tasse et blondasse qui ramasse les migrants \u00e0 la soupe populaire, rien de plus. Le-dit service se fait doubler r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement par la Police allemande et la CIA de toute fa\u00e7on : qu'est-ce qu'ils sont m\u00e9chants ceux-l\u00e0... c'est insupportable !Bref, c'est du foutage de gueule de A \u00e0 Z, par ailleurs tr\u00e8s lent et qui passe son temps \u00e0 faire son Calim\u00e9ro. La fin touche le fond avec les gros 4x4 de la CIA-NSA-FBI en plein Berlin ! bah bien s\u00fbr, c'est un complot, on vous dit : le 11 septembre, c'\u00e9tait un coup (fumant) de la CIA.C'est vraiment n'importe quoi et nul \u00e0 chier, cette merde !"

      "text": "A Most Wanted Man is a real spy film, here is not James Bond or Jason Bourne in favor of the MI6 or the CIA, this is an intelligence drama that challenges you to discover its plot, therefore it is enough to say that you need intelligence to enjoy it, otherwise it will only seem boring and you will only be waiting for the bullets, which I tell you, never come. Better discard that idea because there is nothing like that on this movie."

      "text": "inexpressibly refreshing to encounter a chess game..A Most Wanted Man3 And A Half Out Of 5A Most Wanted Man is a character driven political thriller about a few good-hearted infiltrators whose attempt to pull of an impossible yet utterly glorious task ends up with dilemmas on each step. The stakes aren't higher as one usually gets in such tales, but the inner politics is so well constructed that you cannot not communicate with its designing. The screenplay is so tight and written like a poetry on the sense that it enfolds each time a different perspective, angle, character and a piece of information that somehow sets the clock at zero. And since the feature is build upon the race against time factor, the sense of urgency never fades away even though it ticks for an entire two hours. Corbign's world is busy in all its act (even in its first act, it doesn't spend its time on laying out the plot for the audience) where the viewers has to work hard to catch up with it. It is rich on technical aspects like using its props, amazing camera work, fine editing and sharp sound effects although fails on pitching a palpable background score. Goose fleshing revelations, tricky and convoluted plot and eye-popping cinematography are the high points of the feature that keeps the audience tangled in its world. Bovell's adaptation might be gripping and layered but Corbign's execution surpasses the script and sensibly respects each frame projected on the screen. Hoffman oozes power, vulnerability and emotional aspects of his character unflinchingly with an amazing supporting cast like McAdams, Dafoe Wright, Bruhl and Krieps. A Most Wanted Man is not what we wanted but needed, in an industry where most of the mission were taken over by action and chase scenes, it is inexpressibly refreshing to encounter a chess game."

      "text": "This is your average spy action thriller film, although the story is quite good, it didn't really grip me as such. It made me think of the recent TV series 'The Looming Tower', indeed it does have quite a looming sense to it but it wasn't as engrossing as I'd have perhaps liked. Philip Seymour Hoffman gives a decent enough performance but there is some shaky camerawork and the dark lighting bothered me a bit. I suppose I should expect that, given the plot etc. but I wasn't that intrigued by it, mostly due to the plodding plot pace. This isn't an awful film but its not what I'd think of as especially great, so I'm going for a 3 star rating overall."
