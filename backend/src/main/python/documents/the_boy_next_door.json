The seduction and sex scenes are pretty hot, but it does ramp up to the crazy pretty quickly thereafter.  Won't spoil anything here, but I will say that the total lack of post-climax resolution left me and my audience a little wanting.  Certainly worth seeing if you're up for some classic stalker-type fare."

As about the scenario is is full with cliche and the ending was stupid and unsatisfying the movie was a total waste of time do not waste your money... Miss Lopez should go in retirement she is 45 years old enough with her trashy movies and her awful acting already !!"

It is above all the prejudices they have, rather than an intellectual reflection in several stages. I have to say that the films with small budgets are not the worst, they rely on the actors and the characters they have interpreted.\rJennifer Lopez has been for many (and for me) a good actress, especially playing at least naturally, and that is not afraid of \"not wrong\" to me it plays much better than some actresses \"confirmed\". It is amazing, I loved \"U Turn,\" \"The Cell,\" \"Money Train\", \"Out of Sight,\" \"Selena\" and even \"Parker\" (the big mistake is the story), even his comedies romantic as \"Maid In Manhattan\", and I find that in \"The Boy Next Door\" is even better, it's really beautiful, the story is complete, and there is many intrigues.\rI must say I do knew by Ryan Guzman and it is not bad at all, pretty good for being there for a few years. For other actors it is very convincing too, thank you Rob Cohen, very good director ! I hope this film will be successful."

The titular boy (Ryan Guzman), who's physically hot and mentally unstable, develops a possessive obsession with her. This plot is so overworked that I was sometimes calling the shots as they happened. To make matters worse, there are glaring lapses of logic. Still, director Rob Cohen manages to keep it interesting, although entirely forgettable."

A film that looks as though it was made in the 80's, it is hard to see how this made it onto cinema screens. Its outcome is a foregone conclusion after the first 10 minutes, you spend the duration of the movie hoping it is going to confound expectations - and it doesn't."

Lo's signature thriller) than seeing sexpot Lopez and that guy from \"Jem And The Holograms.\" I really love the sex scenes featured in this movie, but nothing new. I don't know why Fast & The Furious director Rob Cohan directed this turd. It seems as though Hollywood is trying to be obsessed describing as the next \"Fatal Attraction.\" It turns out that formula didn't work either. And that's why Jennifer Lopez' performance is the absolute worst. Just avoid it."

      "text": "Let's face it, you must here to see Jennifer Lopez running from some psycho in her night gown or equally revealing outfit because the poster indicated such prospect. If that's the case, there isn't much aside from flirtation and edited illusion of what may come mainly on the first act, and if you're here for scare or horror, bless you. The Boy Next Door is virtually the same type of movie since Mark Whalberg's Fear almost two decades ago, only worse and without any depth or innovation.\r Jennifer Lopez's cinematic career is far less successful than her monumental achievement in music, and unless she starts singing exclusive songs as she runs in the movie, which she obviously doesn't, it's a bit optimistic to hope she could carry a horror movie by her own. She was decent at Parker, but her overall track record isn't consistent. Here without any veteran actors or quality script, it's hard to expect excellent performance, let alone on horror genre, which she's not familiar with.\r The movie is incredibly predictable down to a fault. Entirely predictable without any build on suspense, the titular boy next door seems nice at first, but turns out to be a real maniac. He hunts her, she's scared. It's very bland and uninspiring, not to mention many other movies of similar theme has done better in setting the thrill. At time it's even unintentionally funny with excessive wailing and less than optimal cinematography.\r Production is very basic, Jennifer Lopez in a simple suburb neighborhood with a few other supporting cast. Don't expect too much stylish cinematography or atmospheric ambiance, much of its gore or dramatic sequences are done modestly. It does attempt to bring more subplots with personal aspects with the family and some scenes are rather unsettling because the inappropriate nature, but these never materialize into more than unimaginative humdrum jump scares.\r With Jennifer Lopez starring and also producing the movie, it might create a buzz at least more than your usual horror B-movies could hope for, but many people will be surely disappointed. A footage of her as herself fighting real stalker with \"based on true story\" slapped on the cover would've been much better."

If there's one problem that has Director Rob Cohen has done with his films is having bad casting, really! letting Kristin Chenoweth play as the vice principal? and Jennifer Lopez (JLO) play a English /literature teacher also having a 27 year old Ryan Guzman play an almost  twenty year old psycho? this movie is all about a literature teacher who is divorced has problems with her cheating husband and has a kind  teenager Kevin. who meets Noah next door  then they have sex cause apparently their attractive? then all of a sudden is a psycho. he starts writing graffiti also  stalking her then it gets more out of hand. Rob Cohen does have well good shot action sequences in addition good suspense. But all the movie wants is making Jennifer Lopez  look good in a action/suspense movie. Grade B-"

The first 45 minutes were so unintentionally hilarious. I saw it with a couple friends, and we haven't laughed so hard during a movie in a while. The last 50 or so minutes is where the action picked up, and it got pretty intense for that. The acting is subpar, and the writing is atrocious, but it's an alright movie to waste 95 minutes on."
