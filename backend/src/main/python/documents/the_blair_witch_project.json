Watching it on DVD in my house, I still felt as though someone might be watching me from down the hall. This is the effect of great atmosphere, and the Blair Witch Project has it. Every financially cheap aspect helps it. It's shot in a real environment, not a sterile set or against a CGI backdrop; its actors improvise their dialogue rather than read from scripts; the lighting is completely natural, and all the sounds are ambient. Instead of a soundtrack, this movie has whatever the microphones picked up in the woods - much scarier than a bunch of licensed music or orchestral tones. By shooting this movie over six straight days and camping in the woods, these college-level actors access real fatigue and real emotion that blows away Hollywood performances because even though their premise is every bit as fictional as a blockbuster, their feelings are real. Minimalism is the name of the game, hiding or only showing a little of any scene - only what was caught on the characters' cameras. Outside of those people who can't stand student film to begin with or can't appreciate something filmed with shaky cameras (something most people get used to in a matter of minutes, and something that is a huge part of modern news reporting), nothing can draw an audience in quite like this movie."

This film was made on an extremely low budget as reflected and credibility has to go towards the marketing scheme of making people believe there is some truth to it, allowing the film to skyrocket in profit. All of which can be completely reciprocated for Paranormal Activity (Although I won't insult that QUITE as much in another film's review).\rI would advise this film for people more linked with cult followings in the film market and can admire the lowest of budgeting reflected in the film itself. But no matter of my opinion, remember as film goers to always keep an open mind either way!"

The story is almost non-existent and the characters are flat.\r I'm all for \"what-you-don't-see\" type of horror. 'The Others' and 'The Haunting' from 1963 are some of my favorite films. But this film is just woefully boring, and when something is happening, it's just a shaky cam vomiting mess.\r The only reason it was successful was because people were dumb enough to think it was real.\r If you want to see a much better found-footage film, with a similar concept, but made first, and better, check out 'The Last Broadcast' from 1998. Skip this disjointed, over praised, shaky cam, boring and uninteresting trite."

You get more turned on by the bikinis because you want to know what is underneath and you can form in your mind what you think they would look like naked. That is an analogy my friends. No, I'm not saying I would rather see the Blair Witch in a bikini rather than completely naked, I'm saying the movie does not blatantly show the boogy man, you can only imagine what the witch looks like, you can only imagine how it actually attacks its victims.. and that makes it great raw, unknown fear. Those who hated this movie would rather have things spelled out for them and lack imagination."

Although I wasn't freaked out by this movie, it certainly has an atmosphere to it, and when you really examine it, it has some very well-executed moments. Especially the last 10 minutes. The dialogue was too over-the-top at some points, but was almost always convincing, even if the characterization of Josh adn Mike seemed to switch midway through.

Just when I thought it was coming to the big climax at the end in the house, nothing happens....big surprise.This movie is a complete waste of time..there is nothing scary about it unless you find filming shots of the woods, watching swearing teens, listening to a high pitched annoying girl voice (that was pretty scary), watching film from inside a tent with cheap sound effects playing outside, or watching a wobbly camera run through the woods at night (cant see anything), then you should skip this movie. If I was out in the middle of the woods, I too would decide to throw away my only way of finding my way around..my map. This movie had a weak, if any plot. This movie was one of the biggest let downs I have ever seen, and I've seen \"Batman and Robin.\"I've never seen BWP 2, but it's anything like this movie, it will be equally bad if not worse, because I would have to waste another 90 minutes of my life."

Our three characters act much like how many twenty-somethings would act, and their reactions as they are hunted/stalked by the entity in the forest is entirely believable. The film very effectively builds the tension and unease as the time progresses (or does it?) for our group. As more and more happens to them they unravel pretty quickly and become distrusting of one another, which is realistic when thinking of how being stranded and lost in the deep woods would break one down. Then adding in the supernatural elements and the whole thing has me on the edge of my seat even knowing what going to happen at the end in the house.It's also crazy how back in the day they had the actors in the film listed as deceased for a year after its release. This film is in large part responsible for making found footage horror its own genre/sub-genre. Definitely check it out if you haven't yet."

The Blair Witch project was undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  The acting was absolutely horrendous, and it was impossible to sympathize with the characters. Heather, annoying brat that she was, insisted on filming EVERYTHING. Even as the other two guys were screaming at her to turn it off, she had to film every moment of their downfall. Her annoying voice was enough to make me hate this movie from the start, not to mention the series of ridiculously moronic things that these kids did from start to finish, from  throwing their map into the river, to going into the woods without listening or paying attention to the people they interviewed about it. Pretty much nothing happened the whole movie except watching them argue with each other.  The vague things that were supposed to scare us did nothing but make the story line more paper thin than it already was. The ending was stupid, and barely made sense even when you knew what was supposed to be happening. Even as Heather is walking up the stairs expecting to find her friend dead, she is STILL filming. It was completely unrealistic. The only terrifying thing about this movie is the fact that it is so popular. I think Family Guy did a perfect summary of the movie when Brian was explaining the movie while watching it with a blind guy. He said \"They're in the woods. The camera keeps moving around. I guess they're looking for some witch, I don't know, I wasn't listening. Nothings happening................nothings happening.................something about a map..nothings happening.... Its over. A lot of people in the audience looked pissed.\""

Everyone who says there are no scary elements in this film are used to the current habit of American film to a.) make everything as gory, violent, testosterone-filled, and nonsensical as possible, and b.) rip off other countries' movies (and do so poorly - THE GRUDGE!!!). The Blair Witch Project is the embodiment of the human race's greatest fear: to be in a situation out of your control, to have your actions forced like a hamster in a maze. Also, I find the idea of not actually showing what is chasing them through the forest fascinating; your mind is left to wander upon the most terrible image you can muster, and it grows on you like a virus.

However, this is the great charm of the film, to bring a touch of reality to something that frightens people, while not real. With an unstable nature documentary footage, the two rookies directors, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, lead an unusual thriller that explores witchcraft in a peculiar way and extremely evil. What is most interesting in this production, is the fact that directors can create fear in the viewer, without the least show directly the source responsible for it. Imagine what you can not see. How can you not be afraid of it?The power of an urban legend is something that can be measured against the influence which it carries in the middle. In some cases, above the power is so vast that people around the world are interested in such stories. Based on this concept of influence, the plot of this production is a journey of three film students, to explore the long- cherished legend of the Blair Witch, however, what is shown on the screen, are just the roll of film found by police, after the mysterious disappearance of young people. Starting from a premise that the suspense has good things to come, the two directors work in the background that is extremely favorable for the development of the script.The amateur footage further contributes to the enhancement of the heavy atmosphere, which is already present in the photography involved. The naturalness of it is the factor that close ties to production reality. The sound system works like a soundtrack orchestrated by a great professional who knows very well to put it in the context of the film. Adding these two questions film, photography and soundtrack, we get a product that pleases and amazes the viewer, while every sudden movement of the camera. It is clear in this production, the film does not require cutting-edge technological improvement, to satisfy your audience.The script is working well and can, from the start, accumulating records that direct the viewer to understand the outcome. The development of the argument is a gradation of psychological conflicts of each character, which tracks the tempo until the final minute. Playing with the psyche of each character , the filmmakers create claustrophobic situations that reflect the viewer, keeping it stuck in that atmosphere without answers and with every move closer and with a look at the picture provided by amateur camera in the darkness of night, where the script comes to apex of the gloom .Combining certain techniques is a superlative effort to create something new, taking the proper proportions of gender addressed. Working from the premise peculiar form, the script can do justice to what is stipulated in your synopsis so enjoyable and interesting for the audience. The technique is not mainly attributed to technology, but on good ideas, falling in the right hands. Exercising a right direction and leading the film gradually, the two rookies prove that gender is not lost, but it takes a few bumps to get it moving again."

The acting is very naturalistic, and in a rare case, the improvised script makes the film feel again more real, as if they would react in this way. The film is clear proof that in most cases not seeing the monster is scarier, for we imagine what is going on out there, or how we would be in that situation. The final sequence will easily go down as one of the best endings in history, and easily the scariest, playing on our minds after we leave the cinema, leaving a lot to the imagination.

      "text": "This movie was one of the dumbest most boring not scary movie i've ever seen in my life. The ending was one of the worst endings that a movie could have and you do not even see the creature monster whatever it is attacking and terrorizing the group of people. I hate horror movies in general this i could and would not even come close to putting this movie in that genera I was not scared at all during this movie and for the people who gave this movie a good review you can not base a score on the movies originality. Sure it was original but still the acting was horrid, story was so incredibly stupid, and the ending was so retarded. Now I hated cloverfield I thought it was awful but it was 100 times better that the Blair Witch Project, For anyone who thought this was good well go watch a really movie without that stupid camcorder effect!"
