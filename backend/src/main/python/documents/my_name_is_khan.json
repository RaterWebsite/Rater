A movie with a (or many?) strong messages. A post 9/11 Forrest Gump. one of the best performances by shahrukh khan. Appropriate support form kajol. Superb cinematography. But the script could be better. It will make you laugh when SRK comes with a copy of \"intercourse for dumbos\" or the way he proposes. You cant hold back your tears in a number of scenes specially when their son dies or when Rijwan is hold in the cell. You can definitely call it 'over dramatized'. specially that scene when he saves a whole village from hurricane. But it's the larger than life looks thats the most special asset of this movie. at the end of the day it's the love and inspiration that you carry back home and that should be strong enough to rate it maximum. P.S. I went to watch the movie with a close friend of mine who is definitely not a fan of SRK (rather she dislikes him for one expression acting school.) She had some prejudices about Islam and Muslims like a lot of other Hindus. Previously I've tried a lot to make her understand but she appeared to be quite rigid on her views. But after the movie ends she tells me in teary eyes, \"now i know what u tried to tell me. and I don't hate any religion anymore.\" Thats the power of love it shows. And no compliment is enough for that piece of art, that inspires our real life to this level."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "One of the Best Movies of all time!

After 9/11, for the next few weeks, In particular, if you go to convenient stores, they will ask where are you, which religion ... By the way, I am NOT MUSLIM.

As a long time bollywood movie fan AND a shah rukh admirer, i have to be honest in my evaluation and tell the truth, this movie is extremely poor. There are some half decent aspects to it, namely the cinematography, but all in all the film disappoints from the even the very first few minutes, with SRK's unrealistic portrayal of Aspergers syndrome, and then to the unlikely romance between him and Kajols character. The middle improves to some extent, but is let down by the ridiculous and extremely cheesy 'forrest-gump' like exploits in the latter half, where he comes to rescue an african-american family from some floods closely followed by hordes of other half-submerged well wishers, and then finally meeting with Obama. With high expectations i went to see this film, especially after various interview of the lead people of the movie, including a light-hearted one of SRK on the Jonathan Ross show on the BBC, but all of my friends felt the same disappointment i felt as we left and reviewed what in retrospect was a rather wasted few hours. Other than a consisting of a few light hearted and funny moments, this is one film i will not be recommending to people. Unfortunately."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "This movie is absolute fake.

Thiz movie tried to answer that someone did not measure by his religion, but more about his good deeds. The story applied some Forrest Gump elements into it. It seems worked well. The film starred by India superstars, Shahrukh Khan along with Kajol and directed by their friend, Karan Johar. Despite of Johar is a known-well Director in India, but his works were very rare. There are only four movies include his first pop-phenomenal KUCH KUCH HOTA HAI (1998). All of Johar movies were appearing Khan and Kajol. The following were KABHI KUSHI KABHIE GAM in 2001 and KABHI ALVIDA NAA KEHNA in 2006 (although Kajol only appeared on small role-uncredited). On thiz movie, Khan performance tried to reach Dustin Hoffman character in RAIN MAN (1988). But like all Bollywood movies, I think some moments were over-acted. Khan who suffered Asperger syndrome, made him difficult to interact with others. However, he gifted by special abilities (In some ways, he was smart). Entire film is about his life journey, meet his love of the lifetime and what happens after 9-11 incident. The story had many layers on what happened next, the conflicts were good. But the ending was too simple and easily solved. The cinematography was awesome. If we want to be honest, thiz movie delivers some clear explicit messages. It made thiz movie a little bit side-weighed. The title and character itself which pointed to Khan is very acceptable. The movie anticipated to be neutral by put the main Cast real name into it.\r Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "one of best movies of 2010. best SRK movie .  a very heart touching subject &  splendid performances from the artists specially from SRK. rare bolly movie with a global appeal. everyone should watch MNIK ."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Simply stunning, never have I been so emotionally touched when watching a movie.
