Regardless, it's less than 10 dollars to see a movie so their job is largely meaningless in today's society other than to bully the obvious movies. They have become as predictable as the movies they watch. Even if this movie doesn't do everything right, the critics were also wrong about Rachet and Clank and Warcraft. Can't you see they just don't like when entertainment from different mediums invades the space they aren't happy with in the first place?"

I still love the characters and the world, a few of the new characters were memorable, and the movie actually got pretty serious and emotional at times. But I have to say, I was still kind of disappointed. I don't love the animation style because it seems to be a little sluggish, and they altered the character designs enough to be noticeable. There's also clearly an attempt to mainstream the movie a little more for people who haven't seen all 7 seasons, which is understandable, but the way they did it hurt the movie too. Because they did this movie so differently from the show, newcomers won't understand what made people love it in the first place and fans of the show will be disappointed. I also didn't like how certain supporting characters who are still important in the show don't even get 1 speaking line in the movie. And you'll probably ask yourself where some really powerful characters are while all this bad stuff is happening. But what's really distracting for me is that in order to create a challenge and add development to the characters, they do and say things that they already would have overcome previously in the show, so a lot of their actions now seem out of character. So while I do like a lot about this movie, and I still enjoyed it, it's not great and it will be disappointing to long time fans. The movie also doesn't have anything to do with what's happening in the show right now, so I'd just wait till it comes out on DVD so you don't have to sit awkwardly in a theater mostly full of kids. It's still a good movie and worth seeing at some point, despite its flaws."

Songs range from decent to pretty good. (Especially like the villain song.)Now the film's plot isn't the tightest or most original. In order to stop a great threat, the heroes go an adventure through several places where they meet several characters. Not a a lot of time is spent on each new character and location and it does kind of draw away from the main ponies, who there are quite a few to keep track of anyway. Still, the films saves itself with all the little moments. The characters are all fun and there so many little lines and visual gags that are pretty good sprinkled throughout."

I can see it has been dedicated to the franchise's fans too much, and not giving a lot to the rest of the audience, including me. It could just be easily compressed into some two-part finale for a season or something. On the upside, the jokes are acceptable, and the animation is pleasant and colourful. It's just that I was able to find ideas to make the film much more exciting within ten minutes.You may go and see it if you're a fan; you might enjoy it. Personally, it's mediocre and such a huge disappointment."

I still saw it anyway with an open mind (loony curiosities, I guess) and it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be.The animation, though simple, is very colorful and full of character. It's a real treat to the eyes (not counting the weird CGI). The songs are adequate, some characters are likeable, the pacing is quick, and its message is sweet and not obnoxiously preachy. As a whole, My Little Pony: The Movie is an decent enough afternoon watch for the whole family... but it's still quite lackluster.The story feels like an extended episode of the TV show with super-predictable elements thrown in. The attempts at humor are kinda weak, half of the songs feel like filler, the villains are one-note and it occasionally dips down in the cutesy-claptrap territory you'd expect in a pony movie. MLP the Movie doesn't really feel cynical or half-baked, but it won't grab a casual viewer's attention either due to how safe it plays. It's a kids movie, sure, but I still don't see how these ponies lured so many people into the Brony fanbase. It's mildly-entertaining, sweet, adventurous, and sometimes charming... but it's also forgettable and uninspired. Average, but I'd take this over The Emoji Movie any day! 5/10"

The songs was good and the issue was for young and old. The Artstyle was innovative and inventive advance or the series. Its the smaller details in the background that makes it to a good cartoon film. Just the scene time was short. Some emotional and tragic moments need more time  to act. A Problem that also the Show has. The biggest problem was a small climax and combination with a bad antagonist (the Storm King) But in a impressive way the Film worked without them to me. To my surprise the film worked for me because of some innovations which I misses in Hollywood production nowadays. Thats the reason to give the film 4 of 5 stars. I hope for a next film which erase the weaken points of the film."

This film provides what many of us would want from a film based on the franchise. Colorful with great animation, superb voice acting and excellent musical accompaniment, mostly. The film does have some pacing issues, a song that I feel was pointless and a mid-film conflict that, while actually emotional, also felt out of character. If you are a fan of this franchise like I am, you will most likely enjoy this movie, because it is good and no snarky film 'critic' can change that fact."

      "text": "To anyone going into this movie expecting Disney, don't get your hopes up. To those who outright hate My Little Pony or are unwilling to give it a chance, this isn't the movie for you. To everyone else this movie is at least worth a view. The artistic styling is amazing and brings the land of Equestria a much needed makeover for size and scale. The acting from the original voice cast from the show \"Friendship is Magic\" and from the celebrity talent is on par with some of the better animated films. The music is amazing and fitting, although a bit pop-heavy at times, but not as much as most of these low budget kids films that float around nowadays. I will admit there are flaws with the film. The pacing is all over the place from time to time and it seems like a lot resolves really fast, but I imagine there is some bit of studio involvement in that or stuff that wouldn't fit and was cut. Also to an outside viewer the relationship of the mane cast might not have the establishment to draw them into the more dramatic moments, but it does enough that maybe it'll draw them to the series to pad out the world and character building far beyond what the movie provides. Does that mean it doesn't work as a standalone film, no. But knowledge of the series really helps.Some of the reference were harmless, some were cringe worthy and had studio \"hoof prints\" all over them, but they didn't take away from the story. Some parents may be off-put by the level of violence that is in the film, but any child who has seen a few episode of Spongebob or the series itself will be fine. Overall I believe that even from an outsider's view point there are a few things that the movie has going for it that makes it worth at least a viewing, even if it's the only one. Much like \"Friendship is Magic\" itself, no sense in knocking it til you try it and who knows, you may have more fun than you think you will.P.S.: To those out there on the internet who have compared this to the Emoji movie or scored it less than the Emoji movie....did you watch that train-wreck of a \"movie\"?"

      "text": "(Spoiler-Free)[TL;DR at the very bottom of this post. You're welcome.]First off, some of you may be asking \"Why would a grown man like you watch a colourful kid's movie?\" If my [facebook] cover photo doesn't already give it away, I'm simply a Brony and I simply wanted to watch it for my absolute love for the TV show this film came from.Next, let's get to the nitty-gritty:Visuals - Very much worth the watch. This is by far the best modern 2D Animated Feature that has ever hit the big screen in years (I'm looking at you Disney and Dreamworks). Every scene was very pleasant to look at because of how marvellously-detailed the animation was thanks to the ToonBoom Animation software the animators used to make this film such a wondrous visual treat. Kudos to the animators, their hard-work was very rewarding.Sound - Even though the film has a Dolby Atmos mix, I sadly was not able to experience that in the theatre I went to simply because they do not have that setup. Other than that, the sound was very well designed, especially the catchy and adventurous soundtrack it has (thanks to Daniel Ingram for his outstanding musical abilities).Characters - We have the usual Mane 6 (plus Spike the Dragon and others of course) from the Friendship is Magic TV series as part of the main cast. Though the film definitely was more attractive with the extra supporting guest cast enhancing the movie even more so. And the roles those characters had, definitely fulfilled them really well (except for some, though I will not mention them due to the purpose of this review being spoiler-free. #sorrynotsorry).Plot - Now this is where it gets a little iffy. With the context of knowing that this is an official My Little Pony movie to ever hit theatres after the animated film of the same name back in the 1980's (and with the intended audience of not only the Brony fanbase but primarily the families with their kids), the plot was understandably mediocre and somewhat easy to predict. Don't get me wrong, however. The film is still enjoyable for all ages (no matter what the \"neigh\"-sayers will say), thanks to the appropriately-timed and clever funny moments that made us in the audience get a good laugh out of it.Moral/Lesson - I will not spoil exactly what it is, but I can tell you at a personal level, it was very relatable and I'm sure it will be relatable to everyone else, even though the mediocre plot as mentioned earlier, predictably laid it out for simplicity's sake.Final Verdict - with all of these factors in mind, I can say without a doubt, that this wonderful, modern 2D Animated Feature Film gets an 8/10. I know I might have used this score a lot in the past, but I am serious when I say that this film definitely deserved this score.TL;DR: With the factors of the Visuals, Sound, Characters, Plot and the Moral/Lesson coming together, this spectacle of a modern 2D Animated Feature Film to come on the big screen after years of absence was certainly worth the watch, even for just the stunning 2D visuals and soundtrack alone.Thank you for reading, and I hope you guys enjoy(ed) the film too. :)"

Pacing is pretty good for the most part, ending seems a bit rushed though. The voice acting for the show cast and the new characters is pretty good as well. Emily Blunt is simply amazing as Tempest Shadow. There were some times I thought characters were out of character, but thinking about it more, some of these moments make sense. It seems as characters were introduced and established, it would be off to the next scene. What happens to these particular characters, I don't know. Regardless of these slight faults, the movie is still charming like the show and is worth a watch. Whether you're a fan of the source material, or someone who like animation, you will find some joy out of it. I mean, it's no Citizen Kane, but it's pony kino. If you've seen this once, you might want to watch again (to catch more things)."

As far as the premise is concerned, it\u2019s the common story where everything is fine in this magical land until the big villain comes to take over. Then it\u2019s up to our main characters to go on a journey to get help in order to defeat the villain and save the day. The biggest surprise with this movie is that it isn\u2019t like what the title implies. This isn\u2019t necessarily a movie that only for little kids. In many respects, My Little Pony is just like a classical Disney movie. You have a big adventurous story and multiple songs. I was actually entertained by this movie and it was surprisingly a lot more emotional and violent than I thought. It\u2019s also not as frantic and loud ad many other kids movies. Adults can find enjoyment in this. As for the target audience, there\u2019s enough jokes and action to keep them happy and the message about the importance of friendship is well delivered. However, My Little Pony: The Movie has too many characters, although I somewhat forgive it since it\u2019s based off of a television series. The premise is fine but not the most original or memorable, and some of the songs are bland. Still, the story itself is strong and it's overall entertaining enough for both kids and adults. It's no Disney or Pixar movie, but still decently fun."

      "text": "My Little Pony: The Movie wants to be more than a toy commercial and succeeds with a serious adventure plot, Disney-quality songs and villains who give you chills \u2013 even as adult.PLOTMy Little Pony: The Movie starts in the capital city of Equestria, Canterlot, with a short introduction of Equestria's princesses and Princess Twilight Sparkle's best friends, as well as her loyal dragon assistant Spike, to get the audience up to speed.Princess Twilight's worries about the big Friendship Festival lead into a joyous song, but soon, the happiness gets interrupted as a menacing airship emerges from a dark, foreboding cloud in the sky.Out of it step Commander Tempest Shadow and her partner Grubber, both of them there to conquer Equestria and get ahold of the magic of Equestria's four rulers, on behalf of the Storm King.Princess Twilight can evade the fate of her fellow princesses with the help of one brave citizen, a gray pegasus mare called Derpy Hooves, but vastly outnumbered by the Storm King's invading army, she has to flee after saving one other princess from getting shattered to pieces of the statue she got turned into.After escaping, Princess Twilight and her friends go on a charmingly-classic hero's journey south to find the enigmatic \u201cQueen of the Hippos\u201d, last words said by Twilight's mentor and co-princess, Celestia.Their journey leads them through a variety of different places, including a desert town with nefarious citizens and an underwater capital. Mentions of never seen places like the \u201cBadlands\u201d or the mystic \u201cBlackskull Island\u201d give the audience the immersive feel there's more beyond the screen's confines.CHARACTERSTempest Shadow (Emily Blunt) and Grubber (Michael Pe\u00f1a): The Storm King's commander, a grim unicorn with a broken horn, and her partner.Grubber seems to have joined the Storm King's ranks more for the food than anything else and never appears truly malicious. His interactions with Tempest Shadow give a feeling of mutual understanding and imply a deeper bond between them.The Storm King (Liev Schreiber): A yeti-like, classical tyrant, intent to increase his power and influence via an old relic that can control storms, once charged with magic.Hates Equestria's pony culture and has a tendency for quite refined comments (\u201cDeliver the punchline, Tempest, because this gotta be a joke!\u201d).He fits perfectly into the formula of dark villains the animated TV show has seen across seven seasons.Capper (Taye Diggs): A sly cat, who pretends to help, but has his own interests. Becomes a valuable ally later, inspired by Rarity's generosity.Capt'n Celaeno (Zoe Saldana): Captain of a crew of swashbuckling pirates, who are slaves of the Storm King. Joins the heroes later.Queen Novo (Uzo Aduba): Sympathetic, but relentless, queen of a seapony tribe. Refuses to help to keep her own citizens safe.Princess Skystar (Kristin Chenoweth): Rebellious daughter of Queen Novo, joins the heroes later when everything seems hopeless.SONGSThe songs of My Little Pony: The Movie are memorable pieces of musical delight straight out of equestrian (and non-equestrian) mouths, delivered in a quality that puts them on the same level as Disney's best musical repertoire.The offerings range from happy party songs to Tempest Shadow's own, dark anthem; a chilling performance that reveals her reason for pursuing the path of ruthless villainy.The latter paints a black picture of the mercilessness the world can sometimes meet you with, in a welcomed, cynical and realistic tone one would not expect from \u201cMy Little Pony\u201d.Only Sia's \u201cRainbow\u201d comes across a bit generic and doesn't completely fit Equestria's world, but still provides an enjoyable tune for the movie's grand finish.DEMOGRAPHIC & WRITINGThough \u201cMy Little Pony\u201d is commonly seen as a girls show, it presents itself as a movie for all ages/genders, with sharp dialogues and intelligent, mature jokes. More humor comes from the characters simply being themselves, like Rarity showing her best drama queen performance as the journey gets hard, the big strength of the movie's comedy.The all-ages appeal also shows in the finale as a good amount of (non-bloody) violence is needed to fight the last battle, because the power-hungry Storm King does not listen to the \u201cMagic of Friendship\u201d.A significant step-up from the flowery past of the franchise, as well as the recent, brand-defying \u201cEquestria Girls\u201d spin-offs that turn the ponies into humans and focus on boring high-school drama.MESSAGEIn the end, My Little Pony: The Movie manages to offer a positive message: One of tolerance, inclusion and overcoming one's insecurities, without being cheesy, as the path to these values is a long and hard one for some.If you seek a worthwhile My Little Pony adventure on the big screen, then the journey of Princess Twilight and her friends to find a way to defeat the Storm King is the right choice for you."

The problem with me is that this movie had an extreme lack of boy characters and just made the whole thing for girls. I don't want to be stereotypical, so I'll put that one aside.However, that one mermaid scene was WAY too short for its advertising and the plot just felt... meh."

Back in 2014 I think the first fan made non official MLP movie posters was made on the booru and deviantart. I waited for the MLP movie since the spring where the first teaser was out, and the wait was worth it as now the hype is fading. Awesome songs, music and animation. The Friendship Festival is like my fics becoming alive. I would not mind if the movie was 2 hours long to flesh it out. The movie did not make it to the Oscars for best animated feature, but a possible Oscar or Globes runners up for music or songs.Lukas Graham from my country Denmark made the song Off to See the World. The villain the Storm King dies, as Tempest becomes a fan favorite on MLP forums while there are a lot of visual gags in the end credits."

So in my final rate is 7 out 10 because yes both Tempest and Capper were awesome the others not so much but other than that it ok."

      "text": "Definitely not a movie for everyone. If you are a fan of My Little Pony, you'll like it. It's nowhere near the dismal score critics give it at all.  It's a bit better than the standard family film in regards as to how it treats the audience and such. You won't find any toilet humor here. By not pandering to a low denominator the film makes an adventure most could get some enjoyment out of.The movie does suffer with cliches as they wanted to play it safe with the plot. Don't expect big revelations as a fan or something completely new as someone unfamiliar to the series. It is a typical go out an adventure kind of story with the baddie chasing them down, the heroes meet new friends, heroes break up in the third act, bad catches the protagonist, heroes reunite and eventually win. Though My Little Pony:The Movie doesn't do anything different in that regard the Tempest Shadow as the villain (not the \"mastermind\") is the best part of the movie. Regarding character, every already established character seems to either regressed, forgotten, or cast to the way side. Twilight Sparkle is the Princess of Friendship with seven seasons of character development and experience solving issues between her and her friends. Yet, she completely does a 180 at the end of the second act and blames all her friends after she makes a poor decision- that of which was also very out of character. Pinkie Pie is her usual self, before the third act break up. Rarity only helps make them friends with Capper. Rainbow Dash just got them into trouble. Lastly, Fluttershy and AJ did next to nothing.What about the villains? The \"main\" villain, who goes by \"The Storm King\" just retreaded ground already in the series. His screen time was minimal and he felt very one-dimensional. There was no motivation or backstory as any bad cliche villain. Tempest is the exact opposite however. She has enough screen time, sings her motivations and is believable and grows throughout the story. The only problem with her is she is a bit gullible when it comes to The Storm King. However she redeems herself ends the movie with a satisfying character arc. Unlike Tempest, most of the other new characters I forgot the first time I watched this movie, which isn't a good sign. The comedic relief Grubber was unnecessary at best, and annoying at worst. Cut him from the script and nothing would change. Captain Celaeno and her pirate parrots were there for the song halfway into the movie and the final fight and that's it. Capper was interesting with his ability to smooth talk his way into trouble, but I still forgot his name after the first viewing. Princess Skystar was the only one would I could actually like enough to remember besides Tempest as she finally gains her desires of having friends in the end. Overall the movie did a pretty poor job with making the new characters memorable.Let's end the negatives and start talking what's great about this movie. First off, the backgrounds are amazing, as is the animation in general. Most of the shots were pure eye candy. I personally didn't like the 3D CGI mixed with 2D animation but that's a personal preference. Every part is fluid and smooth which is surprising given the team's inexperience with the animation program. A lot character movements are awkwardly slow, but most will just ignore that fact. The magic effects are just overall pleasing and Rainbow Dash's Rainboom is a colorful sensation.The designs of this movie probably one of the best parts. The redesign of the interior of Canterlot was well done and more pleasing than the original. The Storm Guard has to be one of my favorite character designs for an enemy army in a very long time. The under water city looks like it it's from The Phantom Menace (and that's a compliment). The character designs for the movie are a bit more cutesy from their original show counterparts but it fits the aesthetic well. The Storm King's design is alright, and Tempest's is excellent.The songs are mostly fun, but forgettable with the exception of Tempest's song which is the only one I actually like to listen to. They feel like filler sometimes or in the case of Celaeno, a quick way to change a character. The show definitely had better songs.Overall it's an alright movie. If you're a fan you'll probably enjoy it but be disappointed by how safe the plot is. If you aren't a fan it's probably not going to make you a Brony, but at least it will show you it's not about dress up and it might entertain a little at some parts. The weak story isn't enough for me to stop rewatches, and despite the shortcomings, it's still a fun movie with excellent design, animation set in a good fantasy universe."
