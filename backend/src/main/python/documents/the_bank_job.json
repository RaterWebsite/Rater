  "description": "Terry is a small-time car dealer trying to leave his shady past behind and start a family. Martine is a beautiful model from Terry's old neighbourhood who knows that Terry is no angel. When Martine proposes a foolproof plan to rob a bank, Terry recognises the danger but realises this may be the opportunity of a lifetime. As the resourceful band of thieves burrows its way into a safe-deposit vault at a Lloyds Bank, they quickly realise that, besides millions in riches, the boxes also contain secrets that implicate everyone from London's most notorious underworld gangsters to powerful government figures, and even the Royal Family. Although the heist makes headlines throughout Britain for several days, a government gag order eventually brings all reporting of the case to an immediate halt.",

The problem with \"The Bank Job\" is that it's simply a hokie movie - hokie directing, hokie acting, and hokie soundtrack. The director is so dump he must have thought that really awful '70s-style direction and soundtrack would somehow invoke the '70s, but all it invokes is what was truly awful about the '70s. And now this movie adds to the list of things about the '70s and make people want to cringe."

      "text": "If part of this movie is true, it is proof that life can be better than fiction. I have no doubt some liberties were taken with the story, but the movie does become more than just another bank robbery movie. The characters do feel very unoriginal, but then again it is supposed to be about real people. There are only so many character types out there. If you are looking for big time action flick, this is not it. There is some action, but they seem to try and keep more realistic. There are a couple of moments of action that felt fake, but it was not bad. The acting is generally good, although there are a few moments where people should have been more shaken up or rough looking considering what they just did or were doing. I think the casting was fine, but again, very predictable. Bottom line, is this a great look at a unique part of British history, well I am sure some where under the layers of Hollywoodizations it is, but that is the key. Watch this movie for entertainment, not for facts. Otherwise it is a good movie well worth renting and ownership if it is on sale."

Ignoring the fact that this is set in the '70s (yes, cos that's when it actually happened), perfect combination of suspense and grit, and even the odd bit of humour, it's one of those precious few action films that isn't so predictable you actually want to find out how it ends. I was entertained and thrilled - can't believe people want more these days."

      "text": "\"The Bank Job\" differs from other bank heist pictures in one crucial way; instead of money, these thieves ransack people's safety deposit boxes. Money is so impersonal, it almost feels like a victimless crime. But a personal message scribbled on some woman's panties were not meant for random inspection. Bottles of vintage wine are uncorked like they were soft drink tabs. We all want to be filthy rich, but not like this. These aren't your suave and debonair bank robbers from \"Ocean's Eleven\". They're basically good, these English lads(and a bird), but Terry(Jason Statham) is boffing Marinte(Saffron Burrows), and one guy used to be the stud(not just the fluffer like the guy from \"Love, Actually\") in raincoat cinema(the producer looks like Martin Scorsese). To put it simply, an American audience won't identify with these crooks. Unlike, say, Joel and Ethan Coen's \"The Ladykillers\", we can better see that a crime is being committed. The objective differs in \"The Bank Job\"; the robbery isn't simply about accruing wealth. When Martine comes to Terry with her plan, getting rich is just a smokescreen to her real agenda. More complex than your average heist pic, things really start to heat up in \"The Bank Job\" after the hooligans leave bank premises. Unlike \"Ocean's Eleven\", or any number of bank heist movies, we don't live vicariously through these people because their booty is too damn hot. We want to be rich. Not die."

      "text": "It's a \"for the most part\" entertaining little caper flick with some twists and turns in the same vein as films like Snatch and Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, however, this film is a bit more serious in tone. It involves a wide spectrum of characters but this is kind of a problem in the sense that you will constantly be trying to keep up with everyone in this movie and what they are all about and what they are trying to accomplish......it becomes a borderline mish-mash of ideas. Overall its an effective flick that while a little too complicated for its own good proves to be entertaining none the less. This is easily Jason Stathams best performance as a serious actor, meaning there is no ludicrous plot, no \"brain cell killing\" action sequences, or dialog that makes George Lucas look like Scorcese. Definately worth a look, should not just be passed up."

However, The Bank Job is the complete opposite. The focus is on the main character as well as the crucial moments of the robbery itself. It's not one of those films which spends only 2 minutes on the bit that actually matters. Aside from this, there is a lot more going on at any given point, and everything that happens has a purpose and its own story behind it. If you want a break from mindless action films, you should definitely give this one a go."

      "text": "The Bank Job is a good movie based on the legendary 1971 London bank heist. While I enjoyed the fast paced action this film offers, it jumps around so much and so fast, that it's pretty hard to keep up with. I found myself quite confused at many different points in the film, especially at the end, when I had to rewind 3 or 4 times. Jason Statham is far and away the top action star out there today. What's so great about him falling under the radar is that he gets to do what he wants to do, instead of getting stuck with nothing but big budget disasters with no plot. The story behind The Bank Job and what led up to it, who was really involved in, was really interesting and made for a great plot. The constant jumping from place to place made for a confusing film, that while good, wasn't nearly what it should have been."

It interweaves all of the facets of the real life heist and the rocks it turned over very well and that made this one quite a compelling watch. However, the main positive in this one is the fact that it's based on a true story. Without it, a lot of this one would have been far less compelling to watch unfold. The whole heist and everything surrounding it was quite thrilling and, as I said, it was well directed and well acted, however, the non-heist portions and non-controversial parts, kind of fell flat. The amount of webs it weaves is entirely worth watching this one though, because it does quite well. It introduces many scenarios that could overwhelm, yet finds a way to keep its wits about it and not overwhelm its viewers. Overall, The Bank Job is an average bank heist thriller that thrives due to the fact it's based on a true story and it manages to take all of the portions of that truth and add them together nicely."

      "text": "The kind of cloyingly standard, unmistakably dubious adaptation of a real-life event that makes you wish for the more straight-laced, docudrama approach, Roger Donaldson's \"The Bank Job\" may claim to shed some sort of light on the fascinating true crime story it's based on. Though, even a cursory glance at the actual case will quickly result in doubt. Beyond that, this just wasn't the right approach for me. The look, the sound, the tone \u2014 it all felt too clean. This is like a competently painted slab of drywall for what could have been a grimier, more textured facade of a film. The heist scene itself is fun enough, but once you're out of it, there's still lots to do. None of those things, however, are anywhere near as interesting and, as the stakes are raised, you very swiftly realize that your investment in these characters is insubstantial, at best. Quite an underwhelming experience and waste of potential, overall."
