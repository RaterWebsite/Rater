He is coaxed back into service after a high-profile government official convinces him to help thwart a plot to kill the President of the United States. Ultimately double-crossed and framed for the attempt, Swagger becomes the target of a nationwide manhunt. He goes on the run to track the real killer and find out who exactly set him up, and why, eventually seeking revenge against some of the most powerful and corrupt leaders in the free world.", "releaseYear": "2007", "mpaaRating": "R", "imageUrl": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/tyRP8JedrDkPPvH3JxKYsdP2esu.jpg", "categories": {"plot": 7.423076923076923, "acting": 7.421052631578948, "ending": 4.5, "soundtrack": 5.0, "cinematography": 6.0, "familyFriendly": 3.0, "funny": 8.333333333333334, "action": 7.814814814814815}, "reviews": [{"rating": "10", "text": "Shooter works.

I enjoyed it quite a bit and I still watch it whenever it comes on TV. Well worth watching."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This is a great movie and goes to show once again that the critics really have no idea what they're talking about. They seemed to get too caught up in the politics of the film but that's really just a minor part in what is mainly just your good ole action movie. If they didn't like guns and blood, don't watch a rated R movie called shooter. Mark Wahlberg is fantastic and the supporting cast is also great. Michael Pena and Danny Glover are both really good and Kate Mara is amazing. She's definitely one of the most underrated actresses in Hollywood. The gun element is really nice to watch also. The plot develops well and the story flows nicely. Honestly, the only flaws in the film for me are the sometimes corny dialogue and a few minor errors. Overall Shooter is a great movie that action film fans will certainly enjoy."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "\"Shooter\" may be as predictable as gravity, but in the company of some truly fascinating realism, some brilliant effects work, and an magnetically bleak political philosophy, the film ultimately endures as yet another solid piece of action-thriller work from Antoine Fuqua."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Great movie. Good suspense. Loved to watch it until the very end. A solid and intelligent thriller with a credible Mark Wahlberg as Bobby Lee, well researched delivering high class action. Watch it!"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "From the Funky Bunch to action movie star, it's been a long road for Mark Wahlberg. A long road filled with a lot of bad movies, but in recent years he has finally mastered his craft and Shooter is the crown jewel. This is the perfect action movie! A GREAT story, several plot twists, and lots of explosions. Wahlberg was the perfect choice to play Swagger and really brings to life the best intended parts of his character. This is an absolute can't miss movie for action fans. I was truly in awe!"}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Overlong gun advertisement about a murderer getting caught up with some other murderers and doing some murdering.

The story is interesting and keeps you entertained from start to finish. Wahlberg does a decent job as the lead in this film. Definently worth checking out."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "The movie just simply excited me..., and Mark Walhberg fit himself in the role nicely and neatly.

If you can get passed his performance you might be able to fully enjoy the action packed thrill ride that is Shooter."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "There hasn't been an straightforward, no BS action movie of this caliber since the 80's. This is all the high quality, good-guy-kicks-butt action without the cheese and cliches, with very good performances by the entire cast, most notably Wahlberg. Critics who pan this movie forget that movies are made to entertain. One of the few movies where the entire audience claps at the end, Shooter is a real treat."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Shooter delivers, intricate, explosive action, and also tries to make a commentary about corruption.

Full of Action and horror!"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I have seen other action movies that are done decently, with good or decent acting, good plot and good story line, but something that always catches my eye in other movies is how people handle the weapons and how the weapons behave. Shooter is without a doubt the best movie for realistic weapons and physics. With the exception of the Bishop assassination (there wouldn't have been much left of him). It does have somewhat of a cliche' storyline; one good guy vs lots of bad guys with a girl involved. I haven't seen an action/conspiracy movie this good since the first Die Hard, and I have to say that this movie is as good, or possibly better than that classic."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Very good action movie.The director has stuck to the basics,the plots good..some very good acting by the characters and also the subbordinates.some new action scenes with the rifles .Offcourse a good movie experience."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "At some point in the film, Metal Gear Solid came to mind. The music, the character, the weapons, all just screamed Solid Snake. But besides that, I still found it to be an excellent action movie. The beginning blows you AWAY, but the last 5 minutes of the film were a bit too fast, the ending, ahh... too skinny."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I saw an early screening of The Shooter, and I kinda liked it. Although rife with clich\u00e9 sequences and characters, the movie had enough funny one-liners, headshots, stuffs blowed up, and memorable supporting performances to keep me entertained. It's not smart like The Fugitive--a few characters and situations in Shooter were a bit over-the-top and underdeveloped to be believable.

Car oui, Shooter est un film \"trop\" classique, qui n'a pas peur d'user jusqu'au bout des personnages et des clih\u00c3\u00a9s mille fois vues, sans pour autant r\u00c3\u00a9volutionner quoi que ce soit dans le genre \"film d'action de s\u00c3\u00a9rie B\".

Unfortunately, this is also a film that will confirm all the worst suspicions of right-wing paranoids who are already convinced that the US government is their worst enemy and Muslims are not far behind.There is of course one major flaw.  The bad guys are looking for someone to use as a fall guy in an assassination.  So who do they hire?  They want the best sniper on the planet.  So how about Bob Lee Swagger?  Good pick.  Except for the \"fact\" that the last guys who hired Swagger, and betrayed him, were all hunted down and killed by Swagger.  Is this really the guy you want to betray?  Well, if you're an arrogant maniac, why the hell not?On the plus side, the finale gets dragged out because of course our hero has to stop short of taking justice into his own hands until he's given the government a chance to do the right thing, but of course that doesn't work out so the inevitable shoot down is merely delayed.I'd give the film a 7 if not for the political aspect catering to the extremists in the audience--which seems a deliberate choice."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Shooter is a solid and intelligent thriller. There's even a little something in it for the ladies. Buy some popcorn, sit back, and ENJOY!"}, {"rating": "3", "text": "It's very amazing how one day Mark Wahberg is up for an Academy Award for The Departed, and the next, he's the star of this poorly executed, mind bogglingly bad hybrid of Kennan Wyan's' (laughably bad) Most Wanted or Sly's (underrated) First Blood. It's almost as if any Oscar winner (or nominee) has a clause in their contracts to be the star vehicle in a stupid movie to somehow dull their gold plated star status. But in Antoine Fuqua's latest movie the Shooter, any attempt to reclaim the success of his waaay better Training Day is moot. It goes without saying that he and the rest of the cast and crew have failed misarably at bringing something new to the table. Unfortunately a plot as bad as the one in the Shooter ultimately fails to redeem the potential of what may have been. The action sets (barely) contain a glimmer of a good movie much in the vein of Matt damon's Bourne series, but those films had good scripts and were believable to a point. In the Shooter however, it's safe to say that while things go kablloey and many guns are fired, that the screenwriter's made sure to forgo plot and just spoon feed the audience's thirst for loud bangs and jump start plot twists. Cliche'd to the point of self parody and way too self referential for its own good, this Shooter misses the mark completely and may just be one of the worst action movies in recent memory."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Total dude flick! Not a date movie. Better acting than Rambo with Bourne Identity like action, but you've probably heard that already. No amnesia here and the commanding officer is the bad guy... ooops, not a spoiler."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Mark Wahlberg's character simply doesn't make any sense. Bob Lee Swagger is like a composite of left- and right-wing sensibilities in an effort on the filmmaker's part to be fair and balanced. This millitary sniper is no naif; he knows our government regularly lies to it people, but still he participates in a reconnaisance mission that should smell trouble to any conspiracy paranoiac who surfs the web and owns a copy of the \"9/11 Commission Report\". Swagger should be G.I. Joe, not Oliver Stone. After \"Shooter\" is through evoking our memories of the J.F.K. assasination, this film goes formulaic on us, on fugitive-on-the-run autopilot. The torture scenes are ugly, as are the exploding body parts and liberal bombast. \"Shooter\" would've made more sense(for the sake of a character arc) had Swagger turned into Rambo after the frame job; but he's cynical from the first frame rather than having an unequivocally patriotic relationship with his country, which would've made for better drama when the shadow government attempts to patsy him."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "While it makes some attempts to appeal to any Liberals in the audience (who've probably wandered in to the wrong screen while looking for Pan's Labyrinth) by being all \"current\" and mumbling about Abu Ghraib and Donald Rumsfeld, this film is basically an 80's-style, one-man-army, things-blowing-up, murder-a-thon straight out of Arnie's back catalogue. The moral message behind it is \"justice = a bullet\". But isn't that what got us into trouble in the first place? Thinking that the ills of society (ours or Iraq's) can be solve with a bullet or a noose? Everything is on show here: gun-worship, violence against women, legitimate torture... Wahlberg disappoints as an unconvincing hillbilly called Bob Lee Swagger (for crying out loud) out to murder his way to the top of a conspiracy - and then what? The film stops. What have we learned? That yanks love guns? But we knew that already. It's not the edgy political thriller it seems to be in the trailer.

BTW, Mark Wahlberg was excellent, as was most of the supporting cast."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "This movie has an overall good story line and some pretty sweet explosions, but it seemed to me that this beat up ex sniper was too good for his role and not very believable"}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Stephen Hunter, on whose novel Point of Impact this is based, is not only a crack writer of thrillers, but in his other life is one of the sharpest, wittiest and most perceptive movie critics currently working. (His Washington Post reviews are frequently displayed on this site--see for yourself!) Hunter is a military buff, a gun enthusiast and a political conservative, but unlike certain other Republican movie reviewers we could name (are you listening, Michael Medved? Didn't think so.) Hunter doesn't feel the need to have his personal politics seep into and dominate every word he writes; he's perfectly capable of appreciating and enjoying the skill with which Barbara Koppel made the Dixie Chicks documentary Shut Up & Sing while still thinking that singer Natalie Maines is a loudmouth blowhard, even though he undoubtedly knows that Koppel and Maines are on the same ideological page. And his novels, most of which center on either ex-Marine sniper Bob Lee Swagger or his Mississippi police sergeant father Earl, are catnip even for someone like me who's bored silly by Robert Ludlum and Tom Clancy; if you buy or borrow any of them, prepare to take the next day off from work because they're truly unputdownable. That's why Shooter, in which Bob Lee (Mark Wahlberg) is duped by the US government into masterminding an assassination that's intended to go awry but instead goes in an entirely different direction that leaves him a scapegoat and a fugitive, is surprising on two different levels. First off, no big-studio movie since The Constant Gardener (which was actually released through Universal's boutique label, Focus) has been this blatant in shouting its take on America's less-than-completely-altruistic overseas activities, which no doubt will make this a discomfiting night at the movies for those who believe that the last conspiracy our government was involved in had to do with hiding Bill's Whitewater documents and Monica's dress. That's no cinematic sin, however, no matter what your political stripe, but being utterly mediocre, generic and boring is another story...and unfortunately, except for an expository scene involving an old geezer and gun expert (rocker Levon Helm, who's just wonderful here and whose delivery is very reminiscent of the late, lamented Richard Farnsworth) and a bloody climactic shootout in which Swagger manages to disarm his enemies, Shooter is sadly guilty. And Wahlberg, who fully deserved all the praise and the Oscar nomination he got as the theatrically foulmouthed cop in The Departed, is completely wrong as Bob Lee. In Hunter's books, he's a bigger than life, mythic, strong-but-silent figure, an amalgam of John Fenimore Cooper's Deerslayer, John Ford's The Ringo Kid, Sergio Leone's and Clint Eastwood's The Man With No Name and Sly Stallone's John Rambo, but as Wahlberg plays him, he's a muscled pretty boy who gets a little smudged. And Wahlberg doesn't even TRY to get the Southern accent--but don't worry, overactress Kate Mara, as a buddy's widow who offers him refuge, does enough of one for both of them. Trendily grimy cinematography (even in the outdoor scenes) and director Antoine Fuqua's sloppy storytelling (he shows Wahlberg and Mara preparing their defense with rows of cans of whipped cream but neglects to tell us what they're for, and I doubt that they're using the stuff for a kinky breather from the action) make me anxious for Hunter the film critic to avenge the crime done to Hunter the novelist by opening up an even bigger can of you-know-what on the moviemakers who trashed his work than Bob Lee Swagger does on those who betrayed HIM."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Well, it certainly wasn't the best movie i've ever seen. but its nowhere near the worst, either. that mantle goes to The Forgotten. Shooter is a fairly typical thriller/action movie that can be summed up rather simply: violence, light plot, violence, more violence, plot twist, car chase, violence, explosions, violence, more plot, violence, happy ending, roll credits. even though most of the actors names sound like they belong in cheesy comedies (Danny Glover, for example), most of them manage to fill their roll quite nicely (there are a couple odd exceptions though). most of the fight scenes rated about an 8 on the \"this could only happen in hollywood fights\" meter. a 10 would be something like Jackie Chan movies or the Bourne Identity. a 1 would be something along the lines of Barney. my favorite part of the movie had to be the rifles, however. especially the CheyTec Intervention Rifle (the one Wahlberg uses to shoot the soup can). definitely a action-lover's movie, and more so for gun fanatics. Overall, 7.5 out of 10."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "You know I'm not much of a fan of movies that are \"action\" with guns you know except for Mission:Impossible and a couple others.
