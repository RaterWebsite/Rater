However after watching both the first 2 movies of this series, I felt that this one lacked in the thrill that you should get from Narnia. I guess my expectations were demanding to the movie. However, what I also liked about the first 2 movies were that there were battles and both Peter and Susan were involved. Their characteristics made the first 2 movies a great success. Their lack of appearance in this film let down the aura of friendship of sibling rivalry. The effects were good yet  felt that the trailer was even better than the movie. All in all it was a good movie. 6/10"

As others have remarked upon, I agree, that the Narnia films tends to cater to a younger public than for example the Harry Potter series - and with my thirty one years I guess I'm not even supposed to be a great fan.. Anyways I'd say that it's an OK film for the younger audience and it won't kill parents to see it. The first film was good (largely thanks to Tilda Swinton's performance) and the second one really bad so by comparison the third is quite watchable - the style of acting is very theatrical, the sets often looks cheap and I never could get past how sleep inducing Liam Neeson is in his portrayal of Aslan but I guess that's all of the negative I have to say.. Watchable if you absolutely must but boring..."

Perhaps my expectations were too high but, my first reaction when the end credits began to roll was... \"Wouldn't it be great if someone would make a high budget film loosely based on the Dawn Treader?\"   We've read the books many times over. Therein lies the problem. I realize the need to adapt a story for the big screen but they should be ashamed of themselves. Whatever happened to the art of story telling? It struck me as a dumbed down action flick for kids."

We think it is also great that this movie decided to put in some morality since most kids movies now are pretty much just for a good laugh with nothing that actually sticks to you. This movie brings you into a reality of letting go and how to deal with things. It also states it's not always best to go with what you want and feel you need to have, because it might actually not be the best for you. There's nothing wrong with encouragement towards kids and we feel this movie had nothing but the best intentions."

Peter and Susan are gone (I didn't really like them) which makes Lucy and Edmund more important and more developed.2. There quest isn't to battle people, but it is to find 7 lost lords and their magicals swords.3. The characters are amazing. Lucy and Edmund are now older, Caspian is back, Eustace and more are introduced, and Reepicheep is more developed.4. Eustace turning into a dragon that then helped the others on their quest was amazing and his personality was positively changed. He became a better person and was a kid again.5. I love this story because it's unique and more fun in my opinion."

      "text": "David Byrne, back in his \"More Songs about Buildings and Food\" days with the Talking Heads, once remarked that \"heaven [was] a place where nothing ever happen[ed],\" hardly the sort of place for a swashbuckling rat like Reepicheep(voiced by Eddie Izzard), who seeks action and is absolutely fearless in any given situation. Assuming that he gets there. Prince Caspian(Ben Barnes) won't go; he politely declines Aslan's invitation to his kingdom, choosing instead to continue his reign over Narnia for the time being, while the wall of tidal water, fluid but frozen in time and space, beckons anybody who wishes to cross over. The rat, on the other hand, presumed to be much older than his human compatriot in arms, accepts the lion's officer, with the understanding that he just punched himself a one-way ticket. After Reepicheep bids everybody a fond farewell, the loyal Narnian subject lays down his earthly possessions on the sand, and scampers toward the shoreline, where the rat disappears into the blue, similar to the way the sixties activist/writer(played by James Earl Jones) in Phil Alden Robinson's \"Field of Dreams\" vanishes amid the green Iowa corn, with the difference being that Terrence Mann's trip was a round one. Prior to the reclusive author's departure, the 1989 film starring Kevin Costner(based on the novel \"Shoeless Joe\" by W.P. Kinsella) suggests the un-Christian notion of heaven being a place on earth, when the farmer and his father discuss dreams and geography(suggestive of baseball as being a religion to itself), just before they toss around the baseball(practicing their religion), whereas \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" books by C.S. Lewis were loaded with Christian teachings that survived the film adaptations, leading the moviegoer to interpret the rat's destination as being heaven, since the mighty lion(voiced by Liam Neeson) is a blatant Christ figure. Aslan alone can rise up from the dead, the only one who can leave Narnia and return as he pleases, because the lion is all-powerful; he's God, after all, while Caspian can't claim to be nothing more than a mere mortal, but the omnipotent one tempts the prince into willfully abdicating his throne and the remainder of his natural life. For his own sake, the royal stands his ground, explaining to Aslan that his father would have wanted him to remain among the Narnians, the denizens he was entrusted with by decree to protect. The moviegoer, however, suspects that the prince also wants to live long enough to \"catch\"(wink wink nudge nudge) the falling star from the \"Island of the Star\" on their way back home. Reepicheep, conversely, by his own admission, has seen it all and is all out of fight(and perhaps, all out of love, too, save for one last hug with Lucy), so \"dying\"(for what else could it be?) becomes easy for the rat, whose derring-do, upon closer examination, was a symptom of his death wish. As the wind and waves thrashes the Dawn Treader this way and that way during a fierce storm, en route to Dark Island, the rat can be glimpsed flitting around up high on the main yard near the top mast, where one false move could have sent the tiny soldier plummeting to the deck, or worse, the turbulent, churning waters they're navigating. Even the horseplay, a practice sword fight, that he participates in with his sparring partner Eustace(Will Poulter), after further review, seems less innocent as it first appeared. This boy, Lucy and Edmund Pevensie's cousin, was swinging his blade at the rat pretty hard. The rat could have easily been the victim of beginner's luck. When Reepicheep jumps into the ocean after the lad, by then, transformed into a dragon, it's with that same dauntless recklessness. Finally, at the beach, the rat reveals his secret desire, as he steps into liquid and, presumably, into the realm of heaven, but doesn't self-murder occasion a trip to the other place? \"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\" is more bunk about realms and food for ecclesiastical thought. The film sorely misses Susan."

The Narnia films seem geared more towards young children while Potter is more sophisticated and appealing to adults as well.  I'm not a fan of the Narnia films but I have seen all three.  This one is my favorite of the three because of the fantastic special effects.  The acting is still wooden, the dialogue unnatural, the characters bland, but I wouldn't be surprised if this film wins for special effects come Oscar time.  Although I'm not a huge fan of 3D, they did a good job with the technology.  The one bright spot with the acting was the kid that played Eustace - he was a hoot and actually had PERSONALITY.  Something sorely missing from the other characters."

Granted I enjoyed \"Prince Caspian\" way more than I enjoyed \"The Lion and the Witch\" (probably because there was a huge battle at the end), but I think Fox made a mistake when it changed directors from \"Prince Caspian\" to \"Dawn Treader\". I don't know why Fox switched directors, but I do know that I would have much rather seen Andrew Adamson's (Shrek 1 & 2) version of \"Dawn Treader\" than seeing the one I saw directed by Michael Apted (\"The World is not Enough\").

If you have read the book and have not seen the movie I BEG you to please DO NOT watch it!! If you are a true Narnian fan as much as I am, you will regret WASTING your money on such a horrible, awful, useless movie that will leave you saying OMG thats not how it happened and/or OMG why did they change the story line was perfect they should have left it the way it was!!! Even in the second one if you are true Narnian you know half the stuff was not even remotely close to how it happened in the book. so you know I am NOT LYING when I say the 3rd was awful just awful, but hey watch it for yourself and then come back and tell me I am wrong, but I know you true fans wont!!!"

Now as a father of a son, I want to see with him the contemporary versions of the books I adored in my youth, though at present I greatly prefer the craftsmanship of cinema pre-1970.\r It never bothers me in the slightest, to the ire of my more obsessive-compulsive cinephilic friends, seeing films of series with complete disregard to their order (one of my friends nearly had a heart attack, when he discovered I had watched 'Spider-Man 3' without having previously watched films 1 and 2--don't even get me started about the 'Harry Potter' series...), so, especially curious about how one of my favourite contemporary directors, Michael Apted, would do in the realm of big-budget, CGI-intensive fantasy filmmaking (I expected a fish-out-of-water, like Lord Richard Attenborough helming 'A Chorus Line'), I gave this a shot.\r I enjoyed this more than 'Harry Potter' films I have seen, though it does stretch things from the literary works, but unfortunately, that seems to be the way things are, since film became less about artistry and more about business (just see at Toys R Us how many possible toys you can purchase, and similar commercial off-shoots, and I don't even consider this series a major player in this sort of area, because of its Christian undertones, which really doesn't mesh perfectly with selling tons of toys, though of course the realms aren't mutually exclusive, not by any stretch of the imagination). I think that Apted did a decent job, especially considering that yes, he is a fine director, but this isn't really his cup of tea. I distinctly feel that if these films are your comfort food, you won't be disappointed. I look forward to checking out the series' two preceding entries, and, though they left an opportunity for more films, which I believe wouldn't be from Lewis' works at all, it was a nice summation at its conclusion.\r Finally, it was great to see (or at the very least, hear) Tilda Swinton, Liam Neeson and Simon Pegg, they seem to be thrown in everything these days. I heartily salute their agents--they must have the very best in the business."

The visual FX were very cheesy for the most part but I've heard this movie had a smaller budget than the previous two which were produced by Disney. Still, this movie looked and felt like a loosely-filmed and low-budget British TV drama more than anything. This is a family-friendly alternative to the edgy first part of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, but it pales in comparison quality-wise. If you like bland and preachy films that feel perfect for Sunday school, you will love this latest Narnia installment more so than its two Disney precedents."

This film was then picked up by fox who recruited director Micheal Apted to pick up and breathe new life into the series. Has it worked? Well sorta. He has certainly done his job. It is a nice light fantasy movie which doesn't deliver the scale of the previous two movies but still manages to engage. Sure there are better films you can go and see at the moment but this is an ok film. The CG is decent and the final battle is spectacular. The acting however of Georgie Henlet and Skander keyes an Edward and Lucy is not very good as they deliever very wooden perfomances. Ben Barnes drops the Mediterranean accent and returns as Prince Caspian with  and does a god job but the real star of this movie is the brilliant Will Poulter who plays the annoying cousin eustace who is by far the best thing about this movie. He had his start in 'Son of Rambow' and I hope to see him again  in the future. So in short a decent film apart from 'shoving religion down our throat' aspect. This isnt a spoiler but its obvious ASLAN=JESUS. Nothing special but a good family film for christmas."

Though I have read that people who have read the book are displeased with what is missing or that two of the islands were combined into one island, I must say that this movie has captured the spirit of the book quite well. The first thirty minutes or so of the movie is fairly mechanical and campy, but from the point that the characters encounter the magician Coriakin onward the story truly takes flight. Reepicheep the mouse befriends Eustance and shows him true friendship in Eustace's darkest hour. Edmund faces his fears. Lucy learns that she does not need to just like Susan to have value, and Caspian grows in wisdom as a king. The ending to the story is triumphant and nostalgic. Though no one would mistake this movie as an academy award winning contender it certainly does not disappoint. Sit back, buy yourself some popcorn, and enjoy the high seas!"

I was hoping that with a new studio picking up the franchise that there would be a move to make the films less melodramatic and more focused on the fantasy, but they failed. And thus, we will not see another sequel in this rendition of the book series. The CGI throughout the film has very cheaply and poorly composited; shadows and lighting don't quite match up, and the rendered textures don't properly match the grain of the film. The result is: everything looks too smooth. On top of this, the scenes are acted out to be more and more melodramatic. Very small aspects from the books are blown out of proportion, because! DRAMA!!! It doesn't work. And it's such a shame because I genuinely believe that the actors that play Eustace and Lucy are pretty solid actors. It's only the material that they are given to work with that stinks. I really wanted the main creative liberty the writer/director/studio took with the plot to work. I thought it was a great idea to give more of a driving force for the central plot beyond just, \"We need to find the 7 lords because I want to.\" However, it falls flat due to too many creative liberties being taken. The book is about exploration for the sake of an exciting adventure, and it noticeably conflicts with our interest in watching through the film and caring. Furthermore, the book plot reinforces a state of wonder--CS Lewis asks us the question, \"What is beyond? What is at the edge of Narnia?\" which gives us a sense of freedom and pure adventure. Whereas, this heavy plot introduced by a Wizard who is not doing anything to fix the antagonist makes no sense (why hasn't he already resolved this issue, being that he is a powerful sorcerer?). There is far too much weight put on Lucy's character to want to be \"the beautiful one,\" considered both that she is already better looking than the actress that plays her sister, and this shouldn't be such a big deal as it is depicted. In the book, it is written like a typical growing pains/adolescence conflict. In this movie it becomes the core flaw of her character. I genuinely believe the BBC mini series version is so much better. Better actors, better direction, better practical effects, and much more integral focus on the true essence of what make the Chronicles of Narnia great: fantasy and story. NOT melodrama and cheap thrills."

Well, it is a little boring, but it yet does not deserve a 5, because it is still kinda good. If you wanna see it, see it. If you don't, it's gonna be the same."

      "text": "Well...the third installment of the Narnia Saga is a decent addition, at best. It lacked in almost every area that first two films succeeded at. Do not get me wrong, I really enjoyed the film as a whole, but do not be expecting a film similar to the first two.\rThe visual effects were absolutely stunning, even better in 3D, definitely the best aspect of the film. The story was good, too. The thing that really set me off was the acting. In the first two, with there being 4 characters, each role was smaller and more dependant of the others. In this film, the eldest characters aren't in the film, leaving the 2 youngests actors to carry the entire film. It was not executed as brilliantly as the first films. The young actors simply weren't up to par; it has nothing to do with their ability. It seemed like they could not keep up with the large scale of the story. Ben Barnes gave a good performance though. He was very convincing as King Caspian. Eustace is one of the most annoying characters ever. I secretly wished he would have died.\rWith all this being said, overall, I enjoyed the film. No, it doesn't do any justice to the saga, but it certainly does not do it disservice either. If you are a big fan of the first two films, I recommend that you see this film. You will enjoy it still, as I did."
