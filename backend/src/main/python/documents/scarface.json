Viciously murdering anyone who stands in his way, Tony eventually becomes the biggest drug lord in the state, controlling nearly all the cocaine that comes through Miami. But increased pressure from the police, wars with Colombian drug cartels and his own drug-fueled paranoia serve to fuel the flames of his eventual downfall.",

Al Pacino who plays (Tony Montana) a man who becomes a cuban drug lord. this movie really shows a side of what people can become with wealth and having an obsession with wanting more. i'm not going to spoil anything, if you haven't seen this movie already defiantly see it!"

      "text": "Perhaps my favorite movie of all-time. Often compared to legendary heavyweight The Godfather, and often as inferior. That is to a large point understandable depending on your taste. However, Scarface is a very different film. I like that it manages to fit in a lot more humor and I find the very human characters the big draw. The Godfather has a much more calculating tone, whereas Scarface is much more volatile.What makes the movie so great is that it doesn't hold your hand and tell you what to think of Tony Montana or anyone else. It lets you take its wide cast of colorful characters. To me, Tony is a manifestation of very human desires - but he has a fascinating drive, passion, and intensity that is unparalleled. While it is a cautionary tale, I find plenty to admire in him. Unlike Michael Corleone in The Godfather, he is not thrown into the dark world of organized crime - he largely throws himself in. (with the help of hard drugs) But, we understand where his lust for the American Dream comes from when we consider his smothered upbringing.I feel that the movie has aged very well and isn't nearly as cheesy as a lot of movies from its era. It did what it set out to do. Sit back and enjoy the ride."

      "text": "Like most of the gangster films, Scarface is the first one from many years and some people didn't even know that it's actually a remake to the original B&W version. While I was thinking about this, it went on the whole new level with the violence for the most part because it's directed by Brian De Palma. I know he's not going to make a movie overly violent to get an NC-17. Al Pacino as Tony Montana is what everyone loves, his character is incredible with his Cuban accent and his dialogue. He has his friend, Manny and a younger sister and later takes over Frank Lopez' place and becomes addicted to cocaine. This is the first time that you'll see Steven Bauer and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio in the film. I love the soundtrack in this movie. The soundtrack is awesome and amazing. It actually came before Grand Theft Auto III which is amazing. I love all the songs in this such as \"Rush Rush\", \"Shake It Up\", \"Push It To The Limit\" my personal favourite along with \"She's on Fire\" and \"I'm Hot Tonight\". If you forgot about that Scarface starring Al Pacino is the original version, think again. This is a remake to the B&W film from the 1930's. Scarface is the original film shot in B&W in the 30's and now you're looking at the ultimate gangster and I mean, the ultimate badass! Al Pacino does a great job as Tony Montana. He's unforgettable in this. \"You wanna play rough? Okay. Say hello to my little friend!\" \"You know what I'm talking about, you f**king cockroach.\" And the script is great and it's written by the director Oliver Stone which is a surprising thought. He was Tony Montana. The world will remember him by another name ...Scarface."

What makes it even more shocking is that this is the product of people who are actually quite talented; Brian DePalma, Oliver Stone and Al Pacino, neither of whom do themselves justice. Al Pacino is shockingly bad, his accent is just ****ing annoying, as is Stone's equally annoying script (or lackthereof) and dialogue. . There is no genuine plot to this junk, just tells us what we already know. Violence was absolutely pointless (and my favorite films are Goodfellas and Taxi Driver). One of the 10 worst films I've ever seen. Gets a 1 because I started laughing when Montana finally gets killed by Terminator. Goodfellas and the Godfather Part II are infinitely better examples of the American dream. Hell, if you want to watch a three hour movie about excess, check out the Wolf of Wall Street. At least that had yet another great turn by DiCaprio"

Al Pacino is of course amazing, he's pretty much amazing in everything he does, but as far as the film goes, its centered on this masochistic **** who was never happy with what he had. Tony Montana, was never a hero or someone who was meant to be looked up to as one of the greatest characters of all time. As far as Mob films go, Scarface is so much easier to follow then most, as the timeline makes sense, and you're not introduced to new people every five minutes. While Al Pacino is terrific, the mumbled lines and enormous greed leave something to be desired. Not to mention that when you break things down, isn't the film really just business meeting, gunfight, personal life, repeat? After a while the film feels like it's going around in circles and really is kind of stale. People will always remember this film for it's epic finally, taglines, and the great Al Pacino, but as far as stories go, this one isn't something I would consider a classic or a can't miss film. Scarface has it's moments and has to be at the top of the list for action junkies, but beyond that, I found the story to be just your run of the mill mafia tale, focused on a guy, who was too greedy and too stupid to hold onto everything he worked so hard for."

While the blood and violence can certainly be excessive, it has the comic feel to it that dulls the blow, thankfully. On top of that, the acting is great, especially Al Pacino. His accent may be a little much, but it really works with every over the top element here. The direction from Brian De Palma is also very strong. I honestly think this was the perfect project for him and he did a great job with it. The writing from Oliver Stone is also great and endlessly quotable. It is not hard to see how this one has such a long-lasting life after its release considering how quotable and enjoyable it is. Luckily, it is also expertly made. Overall, Scarface will likely scare away those with weaker stomachs, but if you can make it, it is entirely worth it. While I did not love it, I can certainly see why it gets so much praise."

Not to say that this isn't a good movie. Some of the great aspects of this film are that it focuses on a unlikable type a person, a hitman I think. Al Pacino gives an overtop, extreme performances as the main lead, and is enjoyable throughout. I guess I should talk about the story. It's about this man who arrives from Cuba and wishes to fulfill the American dream of getting a ton of money. The simple viewing of watching the uprising of this man is simply fascinating and intriguing. One of the most notorious tales about this movie is that it has a record; almost, for most swear words uttered in a film; until South park. The violence in this is a bit over the top, especially the chainsaw scene, but is \"almost\" over the top, I say that because other than that one scene it's not that graphic. So I say again that the biggest treat this film gives us is the simple joy of watching the life of this person who we'd normally not want to associate with. I would say this is definitely worth a viewing, and despite what some may say of it being a copy of The Godfather, but should be viewed only by mature viewers."
