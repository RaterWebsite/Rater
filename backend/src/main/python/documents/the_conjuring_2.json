James Wan does what he knows how to do best, which is make an imaginative and chilling film with several tense moments throughout. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga also deliver strong lead performances once again. Overall, while it does explore familiar territory for the most part as well as draw from some horror and possession cliches, most of that is made up for through its fair share of clever and tense scares as well."

      "text": "I usually like to take a mediator approach in all things: a recognition that there is always two, or more, sides to everything and you only possess a part of the puzzle. In this case I change my mind.\r The Conjuring 2 isn't genius, scary, interesting, fresh, horrific or any other overblown descriptor people care to toss around so haphazardly. It is, however, a cliched look into a complete non-event that took place in 70's England regarding a poor, single-mother family and some imaginative children desperate for attention.\r Why the powers that be chose to revolve this series of films around a dubious duo, known as the Warrens and well known to sceptics, giving them a credibility they don't deserve, is obvious. Plenty of tall tales to fictionalise further based off of their \"case studies\". Terms such as \"based on\" and \"inspired by\" should be taken as Hollywood shorthand for: we take a few of the interesting parts, jazz them up and make up the rest. In this context I would have preferred they simply created a fresh, fictional set of investigators and have them attempt to resolve each of these otherworldly experiences - an updated X-Files, if you will.\r That aside, you get a pretty straight forward yarn that gives you several ghosts of the week packed into the one film. The warrens are presented as prettier versions: altruistic, god-fearing, loving people who can't understand why people criticise their work. The family are serviceable as public housing tenants suddenly thrust into creepy events.\r Beyond this, I don't have much else to say about the film. I was never scared by the overdone premise, the ghosts were all typical types you've seen before, and the resolution is as absurd as ever--we know its name therefore we win. Aren't we tired of ghosts, zombies, vampires and demons yet? I guess not.\r I appreciate this genre for its ability to get under my skin, and provide different perspectives. If done properly it can achieve anything from simmering unease to heart-racing terror, whilst forcing us to focus on issues we would rather not. Horror has long been a vehicle for social commentary, but films like The Conjuring 2 have nothing to say beyond Box Office."

      "text": "The rare actually good horror sequel, The Conjuring 2 serves as yet another example of how James Wan is able to balance good, quality, and well-earned scares with a solid story that keeps you engrossed even when the scary bits take a bit of a break. As with the original, The Conjuring 2 has a lot going for it. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga have terrific chemistry and make for a truly believable married couple who happen to fight demonic presences in homes. Plus, this new story - particularly the nun - made me produce more than a few bricks out of fear. The slow introduction of the presence and then the rising actions of its presence is great. The film is willing to build tension in a horror movie sense while then balancing it with the tension of whether or not everyone will believe the family. Most horror movies just want to skip into everything and just assumes everyone believes in ghosts. However, Wan knows he has skeptics in the crowd and must prove his case in order to scare them as well. This said, there is one major problem with The Conjuring 2 that holds it back; the ending. In order to defeat the demon, Lorraine must use its name against it. How does she know its name? Oh, it told her earlier in the movie. If the name gives humans power over the demon, why would the demon ever give up its name? I like to imagine that this demon was fired as Chief Possession Officer in England after such a rookie mistake. That said, The Conjuring 2 keeps you on edge for the entire film and effectively earns its scares, instead of relying on cheap tricks. Heck, even the jump scares are well earned, merely through the tension and atmosphere Wan creates. Though a minor stepback, The Conjuring 2 takes what made the original terrific horror and repackages it for another story."

However, this is not necessarily a bad thing! Ed and Lorraine Warren receive a lot more character development in this sequel. The introduction of the Nun as a villain also works incredibly well. However, there is also not one conjuring in this movie. There is another banishing, where the spirit is expelled from the home. No spirits are summoned at all. Just a little nomenclature fun fact!The direction is remarkably well done. The scares in the first act are especially scary. The finale is satisfying. This is a very enjoyable horror sequel.

      "text": "James Wan strikes again with another bone-chilling horror containing imagery that will haunt you for weeks. Enfield in the 70's acts as a brilliantly sombre setting for this take on the famous real-life haunting described as 'England's Amityville.'  I've watched some of the footage taken from around the time and although I'm a non-believer, some of the goings-on did phase me a little. For example, how did such a young girl manage to change the pitch of her voice so drastically without seriously damaging her throat? If is was all a hoax (which I'm almost certain it was) then it was all very convincing one and not bad for a bunch of nutty inbreds. It certainly makes for a great horror, especially in this hands of Wan, who takes it to a new level of course, throwing in the Warrens and a bad-ass demon to boot. What a film"

      "text": "\"The Conjuring 2\" Is Equivalent To Its Predecessor, Diabolically Creepy\r James Wan is the genuine Sir Alfred Hitchcock of the 21st century\r Three years ago, the world went crazy with the 5th invention of the Malay director, James Wan - my king, master and role model -. \"The Conjuring\" triumphs in critics and box office bringing a breakthrough and resurgence to horror movies in the last decade,it's considered as the master jewel of malayan and the cinematographic of horror. Wan has continuously been providing us great achievements in commercial films, since his major debut as a director with \"Saw\" in 2004 to his first action film  \"7 Furious\" last year; his shiny and original style to portray suspense and horror through each frame, has made to the director reaches to the top of podium of the films, not only in the horror genre, also the action genre, and we hope more he'll try to experiment.\r \"The Conjuring 2\" opens the same iconic way that its predecessor, now is the famous case of Amityville (112 Ocean Avenue) which reveals to Ed and Lorraine Warren, the renowned paranormal investigators duo. Amityville was the event that gave them renown and recognition to investigators, but not by their horrible experiences, but by unbelief and ignorance of the people, which didn't believe it possible that those things happen. Later, within the film, we continue to validating in a 90s TV Show lack of confidence and credibility of the people towards the Warrens. Ironically, that skepticism would be powered once more with the Enfield Poltergeist, the case more documented to paranormal level. The famous massacre (DeFeo family) has been adapted millions and millions of times a big screen, however, Wan manages to save that gloomy essence of the night of the murder and projects it of a delirious and disturbing way in Lorraine's head, from the first minutes, \"HORROR\" genre shines.\r The Enfield Case is adapted with purity and splendour of a script credited to Carey Hayes and Chad Hayes & James Wan and David Leslie Johnson. Wan dodges references of the two small programs have focused on the event  to develop to Ed and Lorraine in the story (in real life, Warrens had not the least significance in the case, they only evidenced it one night). The film takes its time - somebody says that enough, I for one, the more see James's delights more I go crazy -  to introduces the destabilized life of Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor). The events happened in a interval between 1977 and 1979, to capture each sublime moment of the epoch, it was vital the intervention of the Department of costume led by Kristin Burke, the Department of light and art led by Fiona Gavin, A. Todd Holland and Andrew Rothschild, which not exaggerated in capturing the atmosphere of the 70s and 80s. Wan is amazing to recreate complex and refined milieus and sets, every shadow, square, furniture, door, toy and even each color play a fundamental role in the creation of the style of the director, a director who is delicately precise with his details, even though was a humble house, without many luxuries or support tools, the visual tension is concurrent.\r On a night as any, Hodgson family is sleeping peacefully after a tiring day. Two of the four children, Janet (Madison Wolfe) and Margaret (Lauren Esposito) are awakened abruptly from their nap by an unknown entity, immediately, they go to tell what happened them to her mother, who refuses to believe and finds an Ouija board manually made by her daughters. Next day, harassment persist more sharply up to the point that the mother experiences with her own eyes paranormal events - James's interesting proposal to not to fall into the cliche that nobody believes them. Meanwhile, a suggestive sub-plot takes place in Warren family. Lorraine tends to keep fragments of each case and in their latest investigations, she sees to the Demon Nun (Bonnie Aarons), a superb and shocking demonic nun who torments them with a sinister intent, that purpose will intertwine of a sumptuous way with Hodgson's ending (which never happened).\r Wan knows how to distort every trick in his favor, rung by rung construction makes that final climax has really earned. Wan is distinguished by the ability to frighten or intimidate the audience with shots both day as at night, he knows play and combine the tools that possesses, knows to keep constant tone of his film, he doesn't allow his audience to sleep, and even though this time he uses to more jump-scares than its predecessor, are equally enjoyable and are not shamelessly used. All of the above is essential in the foundations, however, the actors take all the credit Ed, Lorraine, Peggy and her four children (especially Janet) are fabulous, measured and charismatic.\r \"The Conjuring 2\" is credited with the title \"Horror film of the year\" and is used for viewing the constant advancement of its director within the genre, it's hard to watch and hear, the film is not suitable for hearts or minds weak, \"The Conjuring 2\" an instant classic."

The soundtrack is great, the scares are great, and the characters are great. One huge surprise was Simon McBurney, I haven't seen him in anything but he was great. Another great thing about the movie is that it's very entertaining. My only problem is that it uses some horror cliches but its just done so well that it feels different. That's my opinion though.

I must say, the movie is a total let down. It was supposed to be a horror movie, but it doesn't seems to be portraying as one. The concept of ghosts, demons, haunting, poltergeist, are not supposed to be jump scares or some imaginary crooked man that can actually twist limbs of an animal or puncture hole through a solid door! I am not sure if the screen writer and the director has lost touch, the supernatural entities are supposed to be eerie, mysterious, send chills down the spine, and make your imagination runs wild. A good and quality horror movie I was hoping for, is to have the feeling of having to wonder that might it be possible to happen the moment I step out of the cinema and won't even dare to walk alone in the dark, going to the washroom alone, go downstairs for a cup of water in the middle of the night, or switch off the lights when I sleep at night... A ghost or demon doesn't necessary be mutant looking to be scary... One look at her, the viewers can immediately conclude that she is the bad one, one look at him, he is the good one... What is wrong with the screen writer? It is so misleading... Before the movie even ends, my personal feelings are, phew, the movie's soon gonna be over, time to go back, what an overly exaggerated movie, piece of joke, definitely won't leave an impression... I am not saying that the movie must be realistic, I know, it is a movie, it is for entertainment purpose, it is supposed to be unrealistic and exaggerated, I totally get that... But, not to the point where it feels like watching Alien vs Predator movie... Horror genre, baby alien crawlers jumping out from air ducts / chests that scares the sh*t out of you, predator trying to kill you with its concealed weapon instead of an umbrella from thin air that can do bigger damage than a shotgun... With those abilities, I'm surprised that no one died in Conjuring 2... The whole story is so badly plotted, the ending is totally bollocks, so predictable, and it is very obvious that the screen writer has very little knowledge about supernatural and under pressure from the first Conjuring movie... I am not against anyone watching this movie, I did enjoy the humorous part with the police and Ed's jokes. There are a massive amount of positive feedbacks, but I'm sorry, it's just not up to my standards..."

Slightly longer than its predecessor, the 134 minutes running time enhances smooth pacing of the plot, allows further debate over the controversy of supernatural phenomenons and scientific psychology, human tricks and role play of the religion organisations; even if parts of its horror elements may feel routine, it is still able to trigger chills and unsettling moods. Characters development and emotional engagement especially the love life of Warren have made this follow up more to like a family crisis drama interrupted by a demonic figure, thanks to the strong performance of the young casts, eerie but not over loud thematic scores as well as the confident cinematography and visual effects. Overall, the efforts of remaining the styles from the first one, the decision to twist the final act and the addition of dramatic aspects are mixing so well which eventually it just feels so real that leaves the desire to follow up with the next documented case."

      "text": "A very well made movie with minor flaws. The first scene is one of the best openings to a horror movie ever. This alone proves that director, James Wan is a genius!  There's a lot of tension and a lot of scares. It gets to be over-the-top at times, which slightly detracts from the story's realism. My only beef with the movie is how the haunting is resolved. It could have been more clever. Other than that, this movie is a must see!"

The sound design is so awful it can only be compared to a 2 year old with the lungs of an Olympic swimmer screeching into your ear. I wish I could give a lower rating. The acting was good, but everything else was rediculous and annoying. In a word, this movie is forgettable. Don't waste your money on \"The Conjuring 2\" and go see \"Warcraft\" instead."

The sub plot with the Nun was interesting and that should have been the focus instead of the junk main plot in England. Really disappointed as I was a fan of the first film."
