The screenplay writer and director, Terry George might be the weakest link in this feature for it needed a better execution. And on performance side, Don Cheadle has got it covered and doesn't even require any support for he is capable and does carry it all on his shoulder. Hotel Rwanda; if excels on explicit writing and stellar performance, the objective somehow seems a bit distracted as it fails on captivating the audience and create the anticipated drama on screen."

Hotel Rwanda is beautifully shot and the scenery is striking while still being authentic without being too clean. The story is always compelling and powerful, with plenty of gut-wrenching and poignant moments while never feeling preachy. The film is excellently directed and scripted too, while Sophie Okonedo, Joaquin Pheonix and particularly Don Cheadle give superb acting performances. Overall, a truly fantastic film. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

Imagine having to choose, as a Hutu, whether to kill your neighbors and their children, or have yourself and your children be killed. That is what many of the nay-saying critics below do not understand. In that genocide there were three types of people; the Hutu extremists, the Tuitsi victims and the moderate Hutus. The extremists killed the other to groups bcause both were a threat to their goal: To wipe out the entire Tutsi population. At the end of thd movie, when the Tutsi \"rebels\" are shooting at the Hutus who are evacuating the country, it is also important to understand two more things; One, the group of Hutus running away is made up of mostly innocent Hutus but the Tutsi \"Rebel\" Army neither knows this or have the time to figure it out. Two, most of the \"rebels\" have lost family and friends to these people and therefore are pursuing reckless revenge, hence the \"not caring\" part. Truefully, this movie did not show ENOUGH bloodshed so it came off a little weak and civilized as to what it was: A barbaric GENOCIDE."

      "text": "Hotel Rwanda benefits greatly from being based on true events - it prevents the audience from ever being able to deny what they have seen. You'll want to pretend what you've seen was never real because the movie saves up its violence. Despite being set during a genocide, it is very sparing with the horrors it shows, giving each incident a much greater emotional impact. Don Cheadle's amazing performance as the movie's highly sympathetic and interesting main character serves as the backbone of the plot. The events that bombard him are infinitely watchable and morbidly engrossing, and take your mind off the movie's few flaws. Hotel Rwanda does very little to explain the conflict between the Hutus and the Tutsis, and the genocidal antagonists are nearly all one-dimensional - plot points that are casualties to what this movie is about. It isn't about the Rwandan holocaust, but the events in that man's life as Rwanda fell apart. Its messages are bitter, of shame to the foreigners who didn't care or didn't do anything to intervene, of native cowardice, and of the terror of irrational hatred and chaotic violence. Yet it is not a hopeless movie, nor even a pessimistic movie. It's simply honest, and more emotionally balanced than you could expect it to be. And again, anything unrealistic is saved, because it really happened. By far one of the best \"based on a true story\" movies to date."

The performances of the two leads are outstanding and the film conveys the full horror of the atrocities that occured. A film I am not ashamed to say moved me to tears but also left me feeling uncomfortable with my own apathy to the horrors that took place in the mid 90's. This film ranks as one of my favourite of all time not quite as good as the similar themed Schindlers List but equally as heart breaking."

The opening song just didn't fell right to me and really messed with the tone the movie would try to set later. There were some rather intense scenes and some scenes that made you shake your head with disgust, but the emotional attachment and the tears that should follow an uplifting story just weren't there. It might have been that the movie was a bit short (I know 2 hours isn't short but with a movie that is so character driven it never hurts to be a bit longer) and you never really got attached to the victims as we did with Schindler's List. I am in no way implying that Hotel Rwanda isn't good as it is a very good movie and one that all people should watch to educate themselves about what is really happening in Africa today, but only that it could have been a home-run but felt more like a triple!"

If dealing with a real history is very shocking and, unfortunately, still present, because many countries still suffer similar rebellions, as we see in the news about what happened recently in Egypt, and Libya is booming! \"Why are people so cruel?\" I would like to know too. But there are also people willing to help! I think this campaign is that the world needs, people have to react! Do what they can! I think the actors although aren't well known (apart from Nick Nolte) surprise! I was glad to see that Americans don't get to save everybody, as in several war movies! Very true what the reporter talks about the people watching the news and say \"Oh, my God, how awful\" and continue to dine with their families! Is what we do! But I think it might be different if anything awaken within us to show that we can indeed act. A film about violence, but also about hope, which I think everyone should see!"

Without Cheadle's performance, the film would still be very good, but his performance elevates it into the stratosphere of \"great\" films. The film, at every turn, leaves you on the brink of tears with its power as it pulls the back the cover on the Rwandan genocide. At no point did Rwanda receive the level of help they needed from the Western world, which is truly tragic and is touched on repeatedly throughout the film. An absolute indictment of the West and those who let this atrocity happen, Hotel Rwanda is just the Rwandan Schindler's List. It is far more than that and, honestly, may be just as good or better than that film. Cheadle is phenomenal and he truly commands the screen in Terry George's breathtaking and important film."
