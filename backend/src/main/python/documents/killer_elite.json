Jason Statham, with Clive Owen and Robert De Niro was an exacting trio to watch. The acting from all the actors was perfect. The problems is that the characters weren't developed at all. I mean sure, it's an action movie, but it would have been better to know at least something about them. Also, there was really a lot of things going one. The movie is 105 minutes long, but you feel like it's 125 minutes long, just because of the huge amount of scenes. I don't care when some people say that Jason Statham is always playing in these types of movies. He's perfect for these type of roles. I don't remember once being bored watching one of his movies (okay, expect for '' Blitz ''). Why do you think he's constantly winning these roles ? Because he can bring something cool out of an assassin, a spy, whatever. He can pull it off. Nobody can mess with him, and oh yeah, and he's a complete bad ass.

It's a great movie that has a few issues holding it back from being amazing like a romance that just feels unnecessary, and the occasional lackluster moment, but the lackluster moments are few and far between, and it's not the most unnecessary romance ever (Captain America still wins award in my opinion) but it still just seems like it's kinda just in the movie for the sake of having it.

Sure...this is a testosterone-driven guy flick, but there is enough regret, romance and moralizing to make it potentially palatable for the more adventurous members of the softer sex.  The movie does assume you know the background of the story.To enjoy this film in the proper context, you will need to know a little something about the Special Air Service (\"SAS\"), an elite British Army corp. Think of it as the equivalent of the American Navy Seals. According to my \"sources\" *, the SAS was originally commissioned in 1941, and since that time has been disbanded and then resurrected on numerous occasions, most recently for purposes of counter-terrorism. According to Michael Smith, author of the book Killer Elite, members of the SAS told him in confidence that the SAS did operate in Oman to protect British oil interests.  It is interesting to note that because this Oman mission was secret, it would be difficult to document the veracity of these accounts, leaving the author with great latitude to embellish the details. The film Killer Elite is based on Smith's book, and it makes for a tense and riveting action movie, true or not.With that background, the story opens on professional assassins Danny (Jason Statham) and his long-time mentor and partner Hunter (Robert De Niro) as they are making a hit in Mexico. After Danny blows the guy away in his limo, he sees there is also a child in the car.  As Danny looks at the boy's stunned, blood-spattered face, he loses focus, almost botching the getaway. Immediately following, Danny vows to get out of the business and lead a quiet, respectable life with his lady love near his childhood home in Australia.  Easier said than done.  Danny is everyone's cash cow, and partner Hunter has a family to support.  However, because it is Danny who is in demand, Hunter is suckered into becoming a decoy in Oman.  In order to save him, Danny is coerced into taking an assassination job in England worth 6 million dollars.And what a job.  Danny must find the SAS operatives who killed the three sons of Sheik Amr, first obtaining a videoed confession AND making it look like an accident.  Danny is more than capable, and with the assistance of Davies (Dominic Purcell), he makes it look easy.  However, Danny does not count on the Feathermen, a secret society of former SAS who continue to carry out government objectives with a \"light touch\", except for renegade Featherman Spike played by Clive Owen, who cannot detach from the intensity of his former life in the SAS. When the \"accidental deaths\" of two comrades who served in Oman come to his attention, Spike's loyalty sets him on the path to prevent the death of the third. In the end, Danny is pitted against Spike for the final face-off.  On top of this, the agent played by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje is willing to compromise Danny for his cut of the $6 MM.The beauty of this film is not just the intrigue or the fight sequences, but how it ultimately elevates both a mercenary assassin and a renegade soldier to anti-hero status, ennobling their killing with higher purpose and redemption.  It's worth watching just to appreciate this  phenomenon alone.  Jason Statham (Crank, Revolver) is in fine form, his menacing face and hardened body serving once again as an unstoppable fighting machine.  Clive Owen (Duplicity, Children of Men), complete with damaged eye, looks and plays the part of Spike with grizzled passion. Robert De Niro (Limitless, Little Fockers) brings bumbling humor and good will to the role of Hunter, while Yvonne Strahovsky brings the sexy, girl-next-door sweetness to the woman waiting at home for Danny.  If you are unfamiliar with the background, Killer Elite will leave you behind for the first 15-20 minutes, but it is no less riveting as you begin to piece the story together.  I highly recommend this film for lovers of high octane action thrillers. * WikipediaThis review also appeared at www.filmdilettante.com"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "awesome movie, could be better and not original.

Since it's domination of the late 80s, Action movies have really suffered due to a lack of decent story lines and an infestation of stars, who landed these roles, simply due to their size, but Statham is changing all that, as evident by his latest film, Killer Elite. Based on the novel, The Feather Men by Ranulph Fiennes, Killer Elite covers the events, following a British covert op in the early 80s. The British Navy Seals (The S.A.S.) secretly forced out oil rich land owners in the Middle East, by whatever means necessary, in order to steal their land. Five years later, on his death bed, one sheik is seeking revenge for the death of 3 of his sons. To do this, the sheik has hired an elite team of underground hit men to take out the men suspected of killing his children, not an easy task when you consider that all the targets are highly trained former military operatives. Jason Statham stars as Danny Bryce, the team leader who is forced out of retirement, to take on the hardest job of his career. As has become common place, Statham is terrific and really carries the story on his back. Killer Elite is a someone complicated plot, with a first time director, but thanks to Statham's experience, you'll think these guys have been working together for year. As his reputation has continued to grow, bigger and bigger stars want to work with Statham, and any time you can add names like Robert De Niro and Clive Owen to a film, it only enhances it and boosts it's potential audience. Aside from just the amazing action sequences and covert maneuvers, the story adds real life drama to the film, by including shady government cover ups, double agents, and even police involvement in the events, making for the rarest of rare in the Action genre, a film with a deep and compelling plot. That's what really makes this film so good, it's not just about the chases, explosions, and killing, there is a real story here, that is unpredictable and very well written. Killer Elite may not top Parker as Statham's best movie, but it's pretty close. If you enjoy a fast-paced, edge of your seat movie, with a lot of interesting characters and a deep plot, than you won't want to miss this film."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "\"An all-star cast brings to life the true story of Billy Beane, a former jock turned general manager who uses unconventional methods to bring the best players to the Oakland A's, a major league baseball team struggling against financial hardship.\""}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Jason Statham delivers another outstanding performance as the top action star.

I didn't even get their names, because all the characters muttered swears and British slangs throuought. There is little action to cheer about, there is guns and blood, and sometimes it doesn't even make sense.
