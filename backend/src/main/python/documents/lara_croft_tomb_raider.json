Sell them video games with bodacious big breasted babes. The Tomb Raider games are a hit and its no mystery why. For all those same reasons, it's just as likely that a movie based on the game will rake in the cash as well. Fortunately for the franchise, the film doesn't actually need to be any good to make tons of the gorgeous green. The real problem is that Tomb Raider doesn't even TRY to become more than its video game ancestor. Had there been some sort of attempt to break the bonds of videogamedome and elevate the film to the level of cinematic spectacle, Tomb Raider might have turned into a summer movie to get excited about. However, rather than make that attempt, its director appears more interested in making a Tomb Raider homage."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Amongst other things to remind you the soundtrack quickly ages the movie....despite this tomb raider makes an excellent marriage of OG angelina jolie and OTT cool action set pieces. Pacing feels a little off at times but overall things play out much like a 90's pearce brosnan bond film if it were gender flipped sporting a vague tomb raiding twist. Not many tombs raided overall but certainly worth checking out if just for the sheer zany-ballsyness!Also daniel craig and angie swap accents for added fun!"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "It is a good video game adaptation and an enjoyable movie. Don't know what the critics expected or even criticized. The Tomb Raider video games are not Shakespearean tales or had a dialogue heavy deep story. They used the blue print of the video games and made an entertaining movie. We got Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft. She is really good and nails her role. Manfred Powell also improves this movie with his role that I cant spoil. The adversaries are as they should. Powerful and hiding in the shadows. The rest of the cast does the best they can in their respected roles. I think there is no miscast here. Bonus: There is Daniel Craig in a minor role. Unbelievable that he would be James Bond later. The story is really good video game inspired material. It is a chase around the world in sets like Hongkong, Angkor Wat and Island where the ultimate price awaits at the end. The characters stories and developments are well integrated into the story. The action sequences and fights are interesting and feel intense. The soundtrack is also really good but not high up enough to be in my top 30. Overall I must say again that I don't know the reason for many peoples criticism. The movie adapts what it can well and is enjoyable."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "The film is a guilty pleasure for someone like myself who enjoyed the games growing up. While the film is flawed it's still rather enjoyable and features beautiful scenery from Cambodia, Iceland, Venice, and England. Some of the set pieces are spectacular as well! At times some of the scenes feel ripped from Raiders of the Lost Ark, Die Hard or a 007 film, but the clich\u00e9s work because the viewers eyes will always be on Angelina Jolie and her portrayal of Lara Croft. True fans will notice some similarities between the film & the games on Sony's PlayStation."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This is one of the best video game movies that have watched so far. This gets us to know more about Lara than what we know already. I honestly have no complaints about this movie at all. 10/10"}, {"rating": "5", "text": "It is not as bad as it is usually said.I'm not exactly the type of person who likes movies based on computer games. There is always something that doesn't go very well. This film confirms that. It's not entirely bad, it has enough action to entertain us, but it's not the type of film I think is excellent.The script is based on the travels and adventures of Lara Croft, a trained and beautiful English noblewoman who travels around the world in search of the rarest historical and mystical artifacts. It is a kind of Indiana Jones with skirts, or rather, shorts. Of course, archeology has nothing to do with theft and violation of tombs or temples or whatever, but the film, like the game, doesn't care about that. In this film, she has to fight the Illuminati, which seeks a long-lost artifact but, when reconstituted, would allow it to control Time. Without knowing it, she had a part of the artifact all the time, because her late father, whose death was never clear, had taken that object. Then, the adventure comes to her.The plot is quite simple and not very credible, but those looking for these films usually don't care about that. It is all just a pretext to go to a jungle in a lost corner of the world and kick and shoot some bad guys. The fast pace of the film, associated with good action scenes where, as always, Lara Croft escapes danger by a hair, helps us to swallow and keeps us entertained. Without having to think too much (if we make the film it falls apart), the film goes on until the end, giving us a series of special effects that are not very interesting and clearly made on a computer.Angelina Jolie needed money and notoriety. After a career started from the bottom, in short films and on TV, she had looked good in \"Bone Collector\" but it was \"60 Seconds\" that allowed her to become a sex symbol if she wanted to. This film consolidated that, giving notoriety to the actress' big breasts and allowing her to rise in her career and solidify her stardom. The fact that she was the only actress with some dramatic talent in this film helped her. The support cast was practically demoted to extras with lines. In fact, although the film took advantage of Jolie's generous physical attributes, she showed that she was not just a woman with a desirable body. There was talent there and the ability to do more, if given the right role. This was a sure bet, as the future would show.The film is no wonder, but it is not as bad as it was said. If you look for a movie just to entertain without having to think hard and be watching it carefully, that kind of movie we see while talking to someone or doing something else, this will be a good bet."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Me gusto en su d\u00eda me sigue gustando la mejor lara croft que sali\u00f3 nunca."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Over the top,cheesy action packed one time watch!the music was decent,cast was iconic and acting was good specially Angelina Jolie she was great in lead and Lain was great as villain,the visuals were good but the CGI was terrible.the story was weak and screenplay was bad not engaging at all from start although from the temple scene it was little watchable,the intro was cheesy and it felt like random things happening it wasn't that engaging,the fight scenes specially the guns fight was awesome the house shootout was amazing,the whole center of plot the main investigation of pieces and the Aligning planets thing with the Eye it wasn't that surprising or exciting from what we can except from ancient Mysteries although the Father backstory was little puzzle but not that impact-full.all the time Lara was like she knows everything it wasn't that great for building up the surprise like the ending bell thing it was like Yea i know everything.the whole ending was decent the time thing was amazing but the last fight wasn't that good then the end with serving of guns in plate it was awesome.the whole movie was one time watch over the top action packed cheesy flick!"}, {"rating": "4", "text": "I think the story in this was interesting and made for a decent enough adventure, but I did almost fall asleep halfway through and that is never a good sign for an action movie..."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "I really enjoyed the fight scenes but I sort of forgot what the plot for this movie was.

You just have to get past the first 40 minutes. The film's extended opening is so dull that not even the titillating shower and side boob scenes do all that much to hold your attention. It takes too long setting up it's story and almost killed my interest. When we get to Cambodia though, everything turns around and we get the entertaining ride we were expecting. The action is of that ridiculous early 2000-era style that we just don't see anymore. The kind where the hero flies around and pulls off ridiculous stunts while simultaneously having access to some absurd technology and other gizmos. There are some pretty impressive set pieces, such as a more acrobatic sequence involving an octopus carnival ride of death. Angelina Jolie proves to be a good fit for Lara Croft, and not just looks-wise. She shows a remarkably physicality and a cocky persona that are both well-suited for an action hero role. It's mix of action and sex appeal may be more suited for the teenage crowd out there, but every now and then it offers a little something else to do other than ogle the leading lady. You'll have to turn your brain off for the story, but there are some genuinely cool and memorable moments. There are times where everything just comes together and it works. Unfortunately, so much of Tomb Raider gets saddled with it's own inane plotting.6.5/10"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Best movie game ever made. Lara is amazing, she's badass, she's rich, she's beautiful and most importantly, she's portrayed by Angelina Jolie, who fits the role perfectly.

Now that's what a good video game movie is all about. I know critics are still feeling the hatred of video game movies affecting Hollywood. Take a look at Tomb Raider: a good, successful, film franchise that's still holding on after all these years and now a reboot is in the works. Although the sequel look a little decent, but I gotta give it up to Ms. Angelina Jolie. She is a phenomenal action star in her own right, marries with Brad Pitt, and of course, she still has the look of a role model. Playing Lara Croft in the movie is just too easy for me to say, but she definitely nailed it. I played all of the Tomb Raider video games, and the original game on PS1 may sorta a lot different than the movie. I really don't trust movie critics and I don't even care what those metascores might say, but can't they get a good and positive reaction, already."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This movie trueley represent what were the old Tomb Raider games about:A sexy and very confident protagonist wondering around the world and try being funny with her partners.It is obviously very underrated by \"chritics\" who are not even able to express why they gave low score for the movie.There should be really a bad plot, acting and quality in any other aspects for example music or photography.It's not a ten in my book but i am compelled to give it a 10 because of the unfair reviews."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "a boring piece of crap"}, {"rating": "4", "text": "I recommend playing the game rather than watching the movie. It's better."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "The problem with Tomb Raider, in my opinion, is that it isn't a movie- it's one long video game that plays itself. Don't get me wrong, the action is entertaining and the dialogue has some wit. But a movie can't rely on video game aesthetics and action to carry the day. It needs characters you can connect to, a story that keeps you involved, and it has to be careful around cliches. A video game is primarily about being immersed in the experience and controlling it, and that's why the Tomb Raider games worked. You had fun controlling an ass-kicking heroine. But the movie doesn't add anything to the video-game formula, and so you're just left with a movie where you wish you were holding a controller, shaping the action yourself. The plot is pure cheese, cliches abound, and Lara gives us nothing that makes us want to root for her besides looking sexy- and that's not enough for a movie to soar."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Angelina Jolie running around in tight clothes and carrying a gun isn't enough entrainment for me, but, for some, it will be.

Iain Glen puts an erratic yet enjoyable performance as Powell, while Daniel Craig plays another Tomb Raider.\rIf you can put aside the baffling plot and flamboyant characters, and sit down to enjoy the movie for its worth, its a winner, it won't leave you gobsmacked or emotionally unstable, but it should certainly give you a few laughs for its light humour and decent lead performance."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "It was... painful to watch this.
