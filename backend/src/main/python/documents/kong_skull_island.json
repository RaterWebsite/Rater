      "text": "One of the high points of the Legendary MonsterVerse, Kong: Skull Island does everything Godzilla 2014 does not. It is a colorful, visually stunning film with a sense of humor, a likable (if not much more developed) human cast, and not the slightest shred of fear in being what it is. The monsters are all on full display here, not just shown in broad daylight and allowed to do their thing uninterrupted, but given scenes to themselves that aren't just big battle set-pieces. Kong is given the chance to simply hang out and be a character, fleshing out both his personality and the fantastical world he explores around him. He shares the screen with a whole host of weird and interesting creatures that at times push the movie into borderline horror territory; creature feature fans who left the last Godzilla feeling shorted will have heaps to gush about here. Sam Jackson and John Goodman deliver solid performances, but the real standout isn't either of them, Tom Hiddleston, or Brie Larson- it's John C. Reilly. Movie-goers who might be going into this worried by his goofy antics in the trailers are sure to be surprised: his character is actually the emotional center of the movie, easily the best human character in the MonsterVerse and genuinely funny to boot. Ultimately Kong: Skull Island doesn't try to be anything more than a simple monster-driven action adventure movie, and that's okay: it's one of the best ones ever made."

As is usual for these movies, the human factor is much lesser compared with the kaiju part. But at least in this movie the humans make much more sense than the recent Godzilla films, and there are actually fun moments. Also the kaiju fights are great. Kudos to Jordan Vogt-Roberts for directing this movie."

Seeing the cool creatures, the geography and just the environment in general were a joy to watch and discover. The action scenes themselves were also impressive. They were well directed, exciting, looked fantastic and at times surprising. There is a specific scene where Jackson's group is walking through a forest and they are around bamboo trees. There was a giant spider who's legs look like the trees and it was unbelievably amazing.The only flaw in the movies are the characters. The actors are good and they are decent blank slates, but they could have used more personality.Overall, i would say it was a great film. I would definitely recommend it to anybody who is thinking about seeing it. At worst, it should be a decent film with some great moments that everybody should enjoy."

      "text": "As a fan of the big monster films since I was a kid in the 70\u2019s, I have to say this movie is EASILY the best King Kong movie ever made. It has a real story, great characters, amazing action, thrilling suspense and the best effects I\u2019ve seen in this genre. I always loved Godzilla more than King Kong, but even after seeing the new Godzilla vs. Kong movie, I have to say Skull Island stands alone at the top still. The new Godzilla movies (including Godzilla vs Kong) spend too much time with dialogue between ultimately meaningless characters. Skull Island has characters that you care about, that you hate, that you can identify with. The story is really cool, set during the Vietnam war with iconic music, weapons and choppers. Imagine a King Kong movie with a backdrop of Black Sabbath, Hollies, and Creedance tunes. It just WORKS.I had hoped the Godzilla vs Kong movie would utilize this same type of formula, with authentic characters, weapons, fighter planes, and MUSIC from a time period. Instead the makers went with the same formula from the other Godzilla movies which is weird characters who say a whole lot but none of it really matters. If you see one movie from this Monster Series, see Skull Island."

Jackson represents our old friend the US who just wants to kill everything that doesn't like americans or kills them, while Brie Larson runs around in a white tank top and thinks she understands a gorilla the size of the empire state building. And it is all very entertaining nonetheless.It is an excellent movie, 8/10."

      "text": "Kong: Skull Island PvC Review (5/30/19)ProsPlaying the prequel to 2014\u2019s Godzilla; Kong: Skull Island takes a brighter and more stylized approach to kaiju action while also giving the human characters actual interest. The movie takes all that was wrong with the 2014 film and works to improve it, while also expanding a bit on the lore of their created Monsterverse. The pacing keeps me engaged, the beautiful visuals and shots keep me in awe, the vietnam soundtrack proves that you can never go wrong with classic rock, and the monster action is leagues beyond the last film. But what I appreciate the absolute most is the development and lore given to the monsters in the film, especially that of Kong. You actually learn to feel for the monster and his history, so that when the final fight inevitably does hit, it hits hard. The final fight in itself is genuinely amazing, one that I could watch for days due to its style and its cutting to the humans never takes away from it as they are actively involved in the smack down. There is a lot of love and passion bleeding into this film for the B-movie spectacle of some of the classics, but most importantly the director just knows to have actual fun instead of trying to maintain a gritty realism. It rewards the viewer time and time again with a CGI spectacle not worth missing. Of course I am going to dive into cons now, but just know that these cons are small and that this film doesn\u2019t suffer nearly as bad from them as its predecessor.+ CGI Spectacle+ Humans are entertaining and don\u2019t take away from the film+ Monsters are developed and have emotion behind them+ The style is pure bliss+ The soundtrack of vietnam is always amazing+ Expands upon the lore of the Monsterverse especially with it\u2019s after credits scene+ The action is fantastic with the final fight being just awesome+ Environment is beautiful+ Wonderfully shot+ RewardingConsKong: Skull Island does have some genuine problems, all of which never hold it back from being a good time or take away from being B-movie excellence. But first let us get the biggest problem of the whole film out of the way, the impact of death. While the humans in this film are entertaining, a lot of them feel like they are just there for the ride rather than contributing anything and most of these characters are what the movie chooses to be its victims. The deaths are quick and swift with no time to mourn which the film is quite self-aware about, but at the same time there is just no feeling of loss for any of the characters. There are only one or two characters that have a bit of an impact when they go, but the rest is very, \u201coh well that happened!\u201d But while the impact of the deaths were lackluster, the deaths themselves genuinely are perfectly gruesome. That\u2019s my biggest complaint overall honestly, the impact of the deaths. I do have smaller ones; such as some of the writing just not landing, wish there was even more Kong fights (just a me thing honestly) and just somethings just not making logical sense (ex. The amount of helicopters compared to the single ship). But those all are very small and again never take away from my enjoyment of the film. - Little to no impact from characters being killed off- Some characters didn\u2019t contribute- Writing can be a miss at times- Somethings don\u2019t make senseOverallKong: Skull Island is a B-movie through and through but I genuinely believe that is where these movies shine their absolute best, as it\u2019s this B-movie style that give these movies their charm. They\u2019re creature features, kaiju films, a genre that was once thought dead but thanks to Legendary Pictures and Warner Bros. we have a whole universe of them to look forward to. And this universe honestly has me feeling like a child again to when I found that old VHS in my house labeled \u201cKing Kong vs. Godzilla\u201d and I looked past all the blatant flaws to find a world that I always wished to be apart of. Kong: Skull Island does the exact same thing for me and I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way."

      "text": "Honestly I hate King Kong. I can't stand seeing an ugly gorilla killing cool dinosaurs. Initially I had skipped this movie and directly watched Godzilla: King of the Monsters, but seeing how many references of this movie that movie had in the post credits and the fact that I needed to watch this to understand Godzilla vs Kong is why I watched this movie in the first place (I still haven't watched Godzilla vs Kong though lmao). This movie, however, wasn't that bad. In fact the CGI is pretty good.But that doesn't change the fact that an ugly gorilla is killing cool looking Skullcrawlers here, although I was satisfied that he could win only with the human help. Samuel Jackson plays the role of an annoying general who gets his comeuppance (which is the reason why I have given it such a good rating). He was so irritating. When he said he will kill all the Skullcrawlers after he kills Kong I felt like going in the screen and slapping him. Like, just one scene ago your entire squad got thrashed by only one Skullcrawler child and here you're dreaming of taking down every single one of them you zoophobe!?The movie takes place on an island in the 70's. Although Kong gets very less screen time and there is too much talking and exposition, it wasn't as bad as the Godzilla movies. The human characters were actually interesting. I liked the part where one of them dies when a giant spider steps on him and everyone thinks it's a tree. The professor who explains the entire context of the tribes worshipping Kong was also an interesting story. In the end they all manage to get away from the island and tell the world about what they saw. It was a good ending. If they had done something like saying why they were going to keep it a secret I'd have legit given it a 1 star rating.The CGI has been done very well. Although it features a number of cool creatures (the Skullcrawlers especially), it does not induce the same frantasy feeling that Godzilla movies do. It only makes it feel like giant creatures fighting in an island. It doesn't feel \"legendary\", like what you feel when you watch King of the Monsters' trailer. It just looks... Meh.Kong: Skull Island may not be some very extraordinary movie, but you do have to watch it if you want to watch Godzilla vs Kong. It's a bit annoying but makes it up with the colour palette. I really hope this is the last time I'm seeing the ugly gorilla. Because I am never going to re-watch this."

I thought the story was worse, but the setting was great. It was a very nice show with good CGI. What might have been a problem for some people in 2005's King Kong was the pacing. It took quite a while before Kong the monkey himself showed up. For me, it was fitting and it got my attention and I was just waiting to see when he would show up. Here we see him just a few minutes into the film, which probably gets a lot of people's attention, but not so much for me because I had nothing to look forward to when the film introduced King Kong in the opening minutes. But the aforementioned CGI was awesome and the action scenes were also gorgeous. I enjoyed the eye candy in the form of action to the fullest and that is also in my opinion the biggest draw of this film. I would watch Kong: Skull Island not for the story but for the action and CGI. It's just a nice spectacle. That's all. For me, it's a good film that I can recommend."

Thankfully, this movie understands what it is, and doesn't try to be anything else, I just wish it tried a bit more in every aspect that wasn't Kong himself.Kong is a blast whenever he is on screen, his massive presence and sheer power are wonderful to watch unfold on screen. Watching the human characters get picked off gradually by the islands prehistoric and fantasy creatures will be sure to put a smile on your face. However, that's where my praise ends.Although succeeding in what it needs to, the human characters are insanely hollow and have no development or meaning for them to be personalized by the movies given titles such as \"Photographer\" or \"War Veteran\". The main hero characters could easily be killed off and at best I will raise an eyebrow or two, other than that, I could not care less about them.Their on screen enjoyment derives from the island's nature to kill as many of them as it can, and as for Kong, his character is portrayed through the visual storytelling it needs to, just enough to make him likeable and understandable as a Kaiju needs to be."

      "text": "Another solid outing in the MonsterVerse, Skull Island lives up to the bar set 3 years earlier by Godzilla and is another exciting and engaging kaiju film. Skull Island does a lot of stuff right that Godzilla also did: it has a story, a human-centric perspective and a good amount of build up to the conflict of the movie. This time, we get to the fighting a lot sooner than we did in Godzilla, but not so soon that the movie feels like it\u2019s entirely based on it, making this an improvement on Godzilla. The script and directing allow for the characters to be interesting and have some nice and funny dialogue, and also for the story of the movie to flow and develop nicely which helps to keep viewers invested in what\u2019s happening. The movie has some twists and turns along the way that spice things up and keep the movie interesting for both the viewers and characters, and does a nice job of tying the opening scene into the plot of the movie without it feeling too disruptive. Skull Island also does a great job of not squandering it\u2019s A-list cast, being actors such as Tom Hiddleston and John Goodman, by giving all the big characters plenty of dialogue and moments to shine a little bit. It also gives it\u2019s lesser known actors the same opportunities, something I appreciated. The big-monster fighting action is great and is just as good as it was in Godzilla, which works immensely to this film\u2019s benefit cause we get a bit more of it than we did in Godzilla. I like how Skull Island gives the humans more of an opportunity to fight and hurt the big monster antagonist of this film, since Godzilla did most of the work in the other movie, and it shows that humans aren\u2019t completely useless against these creatures and they can lend a helping hand. All that said, SI suffers from the same predictability that Godzilla did, and it\u2019s very easy to figure out, for the most part, what\u2019s going to happen. There isn\u2019t too much mystery in this movie and a lot of what goes on follows typical expectations. There\u2019s really only one curveball that the movie throws in, but other than that it all goes according to formula. The other issue I have with this movie is character stupidity. A lot of what goes wrong for the characters in this movie is because of their own actions, so most of what they go through is because of their own doing. To put it in broader terms, they create their own demons and pay the price for that severely. The fates many of the characters suffer is avoidable, unnecessary and founded in decisions based on emotion. Many of them do their best to get out of the situation that they\u2019re in, but are hampered by the actions of other characters. This is an area where this movie falters a bit from Godzilla. Despite these flaws, Skull Island is a great kaiju movie that hits the bar set by Godzilla in many ways and is another solid installment in the MonsterVerse."

Wait a minute\"This is supposed to be 1974, but apparently no one bothered to check any actual history. Even the props are more modern, with an office full of DEC-VT100 display terminals from 1978 and later. Many other items in this movie are clearly more modern than they should be. Totally lazy for such an expensive project.I guess if you cast Samuel L. Jackson into anything these days, it must pass his \"cartoon silliness test\" to be produced. Tarantino can get away with this with great dialog and action. The clowns producing this hairball should hide their faces in public.You can tell from the very beginning that this is going to be bad. Even if you, as did I, go into it expecting very little. The setup of the movie is long and face-slapping clich\u00e9. The actors, whom we know to be quite skilled, are entirely wasted by bad bad bad dialogue and bad direction. The editing is not so good either.And when we get out onto the ocean (1974 remember), we are insulted by Hollywood physics and meteorology. A huge storm doesn\u2019t even churn up the waves near the ship *facepalm*Of course, the dorks then fly their non-vintage helicopters into the hellstorm, with super-fake lightning all around, and get through to see the beautiful islands.Within a few minutes, ALL of them have been knocked down by insisting on flying close enough to Kong to get bashed *facepalm* holy crap.Things only get more clich\u00e9d from there, with the grizzly 28 year survivor (with the 20 year old son at the end), the demented Samuel Jackson staring and almost drooling as he chews the scenery.Vietnam veterans are insulted by their blind obedience to a ranting idiot.

This is worse.p.s. Quoting great movies of the past (NO SPOILERS) does not improve anything...it just makes you realise how sxxx the film is a lot faster than it would do otherwise."

Turned \"we've seen this before\" about 1/2 way into the film. Stolen themes from other movies. Samuel Jackson as Captain Ahab. Brie Larson as the love interest in Mighty Joe Young. Killer animals from Jurassic Park. A moderately entertaining film on a winter's afternoon"

      "text": "An embarrassing wet fart of a film.  Absolutely boring monster designs, seriously a bipedal lizard?  That's all you could come up with?  It ends up trying to connect itself to \"Pacific Rim\" or something with the whole \"Hollow Earth\" theory they introduce one quarter of the way into the plot.  Speaking of which, what is even happening in this movie?  Everything goes wrong because of the humans arriving, Kong is never captured, just yelled at by Samuel L. Jackson for the entire breadth of the movie.  Other acting talent is totally wasted here including Jon Goodman, who granted is a heck of a lot better than say, Jack Black, but isn't well developed.  I found Kong himself to be fairly boring, especially when compared to 2005's Peter Jackson's \"Kong\" film, he was just on the island as was John C. Reilly as I suppose comedic support in a movie that didn't need it.  I suppose I ought to chalk most of the lack-there-of  of charm was mostly due to the period, the 70's just doesn't work here, and it paints the military as these stereotypical grunts that are apparently all Vietnam vets too.  Everyone in this movie is a veteran too!  How about that?  How inclusive of Hollywood.  The only real highlight here, is some average performances, a bizarre giant spider battle, more-so with a focus on giant spider \"legs\" and a couple interesting entirely computer animated Kong fighting a lizard-thing battles.  I suppose if that's all you wanted, and don't care about any people in this movie, then you can join me in being utterly confused as to why we even spend so much time with once again, totally wooden, boring, poorly developed characters.  Its been done a billion times, we see this in every monster movie, why do they keep writing characters like this?  At least, the Peter Jackson contribution had a focus, not an amazing one, not a stupendous one, but it at least showed very human performances, especially between the big ape himself and his beautiful self-imposed damsel in distress, Naomi Watts.  You can argue that they're both not amazing films, but I could always go back and find something \"fun\" or engaging in 2005's rendition over this burning dog turd of a film.  As it stands, the very original King Kong is still a great film and I'd still watch that before going to see another terrible attempt at a re-boot or a remake or whatever Hollywood wants to call this poor excuse for a film."

      "text": "\"Kong: Skull Island\" has it's moments of fun and being epic, but can somehow feel so small. Peter Jackson's \"King Kong\" was far superior than this and felt more grand in it's scale. The whole experience was kinda hollow.Besides the characters being really one note; John C. Reilly was the best part of this movie. A real show stealer. I rather see a movie with Reilly's character being stuck on the island with Kong. I mean, nothing against the other actors, as they did the best for what's been written for them. I just couldn't care less when characters bite the dust.The influences of \"Apocalypse Now\" and Spielberg movies, mostly \"Jurassic Park\", is an interesting mix. The director, Jordan Vogt-Roberts has a vision and when you hear him talk in interviews, he knows what he's talking about. To be fair, he handle the action scenes very well. The visual queues of classic cinema are there and can be harsh when it comes to criticism of his own work. Everything else was more of a miss than a hit."

      "text": "Since Deep Blue Sea I didnt see director who would off his main lead in middle of movie in one second like its nothing.Anywho, to the film. Solid monster movie. CGIs are good, battles between Kong and humans or the lizardy thingy are pretty entertaining. Movie tried to pretend it has lore, although it doesnt, but threw all of that into trashbin very soon so cool. At the end of the day its monster movie with monsters killing humans like its nothing and monsters fighting in epic battles. Delivers that very well. So if you are one of those who cant stand any movie that is below level of Kubrick, stay away. If you want to have some fun seeing giant monsters kicking each other ass, with flavor of Vietnam war songs, flamethrowers, Heuys and so on, grab a popcorn and enjoy the ride.PS: If you saw 2014 Godzilla and liked it, you will like this too. If you didnt, you wont like this movie."

      "text": "Kong:Skull Island was a surprise to me. I had walked into the movie with my husband expecting a bad movie, or at the very least something like the most recent version of Godzilla. However, for what it was, it was a lot better. That would be a summer blockbusting creature feature.Don't get me wrong, Kong won't win any drama awards. It is a B grade monster movie filmed with a AAA budget. The budget was worth it though. The effects were believable and very enjoyable. The only issue I had with the filming was the transition from night scenes to day scenes left me blind for a few seconds.The acting was decent for what they had. The only really fleshed out character was John Reilly as a shot down American Pilot (if you have seen a preview or trailer you already know he who is, the funny older guy). John Goodman, Samuel L Jackson, and team are all good at what they do, but they just weren't fleshed out. Their characters were generic.Probably the most interesting part though was little Easter eggs laid around that indicated Mothra, Godzilla and I believe King Ghidorah. It even includes a monster hunting organization. I love the idea of a marvel level universe for the large monsters. This is a good idea, almost as good of an idea as Universal's monster universe started by the remake of the Mummy next month.The good: It hit all the right notes for a monster movie, action, adventure, no reliance on arbitrary romance. I didn't detect any racist stereotyping and I really liked that it was set in 1973.The bad: Some of the effects were filmed for 3D, I did not watch that version, but even the flat 2D screen was annoying when it tried to push those scenes into the movie. Also, I would have liked more monstrous creatures on the island."

People were hating on Jackson\u00b4s King Kong but that movie blows this **** out of the water in every aspect. Whether its acting, action, characters, soundtrack, hell even the so called bad cgi in King Kong was more enjoyable to watch than this. The only reason this movie exists is to set up the duel with godzilla, but both movies were horrid so what can we expect from it... Some good actors wasted their time and good name on this ****e and some ****e actors got opportunity to show of their suckage like the lead female, quite possibly the most useless and generic \"character\" in a while."

It's a hodgepodge of cliched dialogue and badly acted scenes with long periods of nothing happening.Kong goes missing for half an hour at a time .They rip off ideas from apocalypse now and moby dick and likely a dozen other films but in a cheesy way.It was like watching a bunch of bad low budget b-movies all strung together. Tom Hiddleston is so out of place in this film it's not even funny.He and the other actors just phone in their lines . The 3-d was practically non existent so i wish i hadn't paid extra.Sorry i even went to this junker."

So much more could have been done with the characters' stories, the photographer & scientists got short shrift. The natives were especially meh, no cool rituals or any action vis a vis Kong there.

      "text": "Kong Skull Island is a dumb film, but it\u2019s the sort of dumb film I like.  It never tries to over stretch it boundaries and gives you exactly what you expect but it is entertaining in that sense, so my predictions of it being a mediocre film feel unjustified.  I think this is a good film.  It could have used a bit more Kong and the plot doesn\u2019t flow quite as well as it could have, but what it does well it does well.  The dialogue is pretty good some of the characters are relatively entertaining, though some of them are not as well written.  The acting is fairly decent and the effects hold up alright.  Anyone who saw 2014\u2019s Godzilla should check this one out.  It\u2019s a very similar film and it almost follows the plot beat for beat.  This unfortunately means that you probably won\u2019t enjoy it as much if your problem with the Godzilla film was that they focused too much on the humans at the expense of the monsters.  You can probably tell from my brief descriptions whether you are going to like this film or not.  I would recommend seeing it at the cinema as I think you won\u2019t get the same effect on the TV screen and it comes with my recommendation.  This is a pretty good film.  If you are going to see the film, stay until the end of the credits, there\u2019s a post credit scene which sets up future movies and it\u2019s really awesome."
