Most fans of this subgenre will praise it not because it is an excellent film, but because the ones that came before it are infinitely much worse. Have you seen \"The Haunting in Connecticut\"?\r The unlucky family in this horror film is the five members of the Lambert family. Each of them is terrorized by a mysterious creature, but most unlucky is young Dalton, who is in a deep sleep and would not wake up. A doctor says that he isn't in a coma. A psychic claims that his spiritual body is trapped in another dimension she likes to call, The Further. Dalton's parents, Josh and Renai, are, to say the least, confused. Whether any of these explanations makes sense or not is not a major concern, because the story mainly serves as an opening to provide scares.\r \"Insidious\" is conscious of the genre's obvious clich\u00e9s, but it avoids some of them by conforming to an unhelpful, alternative idea that is soon to be a clich\u00e9 itself. Characters living in haunted houses are often so traumatized by the ghouls that they forget about the possible action of, you know, leaving the house. The Lambert family makes the practical decision of abandoning their home early on in the film, only to have their efforts thwarted when they are told that it's not the house that's haunted, but their son. \"Oooooooo\". So, instead of one haunted house, we get two haunted houses.\r Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/insidious-movie-review/"}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Overall, I thought this film was okay. I'm a fan of Rose Byrne, I think she's a hugely underrated actress and so I had high hopes for this film, but I was a little disappointed. Horror is my favourite and most watched genre and as such I didn't think that this film really offered up anything new. Firstly the good. Elements of this film were undoubtedly creepy. Certain aspects of the storyline were chilling and the overall concept was, I thought, quite original. In other words, it wasn't your typical 'haunted house' story where things go bump and people scream (but never seem to move house....), so for that I was grateful. Also, I think what ruins a lot of horror films is when someone does something that makes you think 'Well I wouldn't have done that' (like walking into a scary room without looking for a light, no one in the history of mankind has ever done that...) because that disconnects you from the action and makes you sit there with a slightly unimpressed look on your face at how stupid the person on screen seems to be. But this film didn't really have any of those moments, they all seemed to be fairly rational, sensible people making fairly rational, sensible decisions. That made the whole story better for me. !However! There came a point where that was no longer the case. What started off as a genuinely uncomfortable and creepy film turned into what I thought was a bit like a Michael Jackson 'Thriller' video out-take. I went from, 'well there goes any hope of me sleeping for the next ten years', to '....did that really just happen (insert appropriate unimpressed face here)' in the space of about 30 minutes. I felt like the plot got too ahead of itself and everyone went a bit CGI crazy. Elements were still scary, but I felt like the film started to rely too much on jump scares than actual, real terror moments. Anyone would jump if you made a loud noise and shoved a scary picture in their face, to me that isn't the same and just produces moments that are totally forgettable. So on the whole, I thought this film was okay. Parts were original, well thought out and outright creepy but the direction that the film went in let it down completely. A great film if you're with a friend and want to have a few scares but nothing I can see being remembered any time in the near future."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Insidious seems as if it was split into two parts, each with a completely different director.

That MAY be an exaggeration, considering all the positive things I heard about it, but that doesn't make all that much of a difference.The movie was predictable, insipid, and silly and just really shoddily done. The acting is atrocious from most of the cast, especially the father. It's as if the writers pulled together several hundred ghostly anecdotes, scary pictures that have been floating around the internet for years, horror story tropes, etc. and somehow created a movie out of it.The only aspect of the movie that I CAN respect is something that I just complained about: It is silly, and it doesn't take itself too seriously. There are some things included that aren't in every horror story such as the \"tip-toe through the tulips\" theme song (those who have seen it know what I mean) and the two paranormal detectives and their gadgets.

After hearing its praises, and as a huge horror movie fan.  I couldn't wait to see this, and the first half of the movie met and went beyond my expectations. But this was just the first half, the second half contradicts the plot of the movie and makes the whole concept ridiculous.  The first half of the movie is an excellent movie about a haunting, whereas the second half is a paranormal search into the ghost's world.  Without giving anything away, I want to give you an example of how much this plot contradicts and stretches the movie's plot.  Imagine your watching 'The Notebook' and midway through the movie, it turns into 'Mortal Kombat,' pretty drastic change in pacing and plot right?? Well that's what Insidious felt like.  The Good:  The first half of the movie delivers scares and creeps, movie has a great spooky environment, decent enough acting (nothing to brag about).

It's nothing we haven't seen before. Sprits linger around and everyone freaks out trying to save a young kid. It's really that simple.

I will give credit where credit is due, but only where credit is due. Insidious did something that must horror films of today cannot, it made me jump. That's all it did though. For the first time sense The House of the Devil back in 2009 I felt scared watching a film. It surprised me at first and I was taken into the story line. However, the last forty minutes of this film were so random, out there and completely ridiculous that I could no longer enjoy the film. I sat through the last twenty minutes begging for it to just be over. James Wan the director of Saw has swam in the glory of the franchise ever since it launched his career in 2004, but after his last failed attempt with Dead Silence back in 2007 did any of us really expect anything more from James Wan with Insidious. Sure he successfully got Oren Peli to produce the film but after the success of Paranormal Activity this guy has been throwing himself at everything horror. The simple conclusion is that the names advertised with this film are a bunch of one hit wonders.  The film was as cheesy as they come with a dumb down completely ridiculous story line. I could hardly even bare watching the last twenty minutes. However, for the first time in almost two years I was scared.

Pros: Brilliantly directed and edited; some old-fashioned haunted house elements; very scary and very chilling, yet humorous and even a bit campy; introduces us to one of the scariest images in a horror film to date. Cons: Some flawed writing and plot development; poorly acted; some choppy special effects."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Holy S**t is not two words I use often, but i found myself repeating them over and over again at this movie. It is not usual that a horror film's trailer makes me evacuate my bowels, but this one certainly did. The movie is jumpy and scary throughout but at some points, the story seemed silly. But this doesn't matter when you are trembling at the scary moment that you know is coming. The creators of this movie have out done themselves with this movie. If you think Paranormal Activity was bad, just WAIT until you see this."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "It's a fun movie - if you see it in the theater (and yes, the theater is a must IF you decide to see this) - and there are plenty of jump out of your skin moments, but it's not as creepy as the Paranormal Activity films.  And the very significant humor element provides perhaps too much relief in the scheme of things.   I'm a little surprised it's a PG-13 movie, even with the F-bomb (I thought that was all it took - \"Student Bodies\" -> \"I'd just like to take this opportunity to say, \"F*** You.\"), and the violence.  But then the MPAA is about as consistent as the NCAA on these things.  Wilson and Byrne are terrific, as is the old lady - the ghost whisperer, for lack of a better term.  I just didn't leave the theater extremely scared like I did after the PA films.  And the truly freaky \"ghost\" looked a little bit too much like Darth Maul for my liking.  Made me think of Jar Jar Binks when I shouldn't have."}], "recommendations": ["annabelle", "insidious_chapter_2", "malignant", "dead_silence", "the_possession", "dark_skies", "countdown", "the_ring", "the_grudge", "the_conjuring", "chernobyl_diaries", "the_grudge_2", "the_haunting_in_connecticut", "ouija", "devil", "paranormal_activity", "the_amityville_horror", "drag_me_to_hell", "the_boy", "the_descent", "sinister_2", "paranormal_activity_2", "the_curse_of_la_llorona", "it_follows", "hereditary"]}
