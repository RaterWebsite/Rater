      "text": "I really want to say this I'm a geek for movies that has to do with sci-fi and horror and action, as well as the genre of fantasy. When a film gets released with these very good qualities, I'm your number one man at the movies ready to see it. So when I saw Legion's preview I was very giddy, but there's a problem. What I don't appreciate is that Hollywood thinks I'm a nerd and a geek so I'm going to watch a mediocre movie no matter what. Just because it has a glossy packaging doesn't mean it's good.  What's better to attract a sixteen year old boy to the movies? Oooo I know let's put a poster with the main character and lets have him have really big guns. Wait I have a better idea let's put angel wings behind him that should do the trick. Then the trailer will have cool explosions and really exciting one-liners. Damn this movie got me hooked I'm watching this. They pay $10.50 ticket, $21.00 if they have a date then another $20.00 for food; watching a bad movie not priceless. Well I'm 23 years old and I have seen my share of movies to uncover studios bulls@#t. Legion is a movie that tries to capture fan boys because of the cool images but the serving is really distasteful. It's another stupid attempt to make a franchise.  Legion's plot is a weird one with several holes in it but I'll get to that later. God has lost faith in mankind; he's basically tired of us. So in the bible he sent a flood like much of us has learned, so he decides to send mindless zombies who are possessed by angels. Yeah I said that I didn't stutter. You heard me say mindless zombies right because they're going to end up as target practice like we didn't know that was going to happen. So back to the plot, Michael who is an angel does not agree with God's descion. So he decides to come to earth and sacrifices his angel status and becomes human. You see I put \"angel status\" the movie never explains why he does that. He goes to diner full of misfits to protect a pregnant woman who bears the child to end the war. I have a number of questions on this, where is the father of the child no explanation and nobody bothers to ask. Why does God wants zombies to end the world, is he a big studio executive who wants to see action or God's a big George Romero fan wanted to use zombies.  I'm sorry but Legion being directed by a former special effects director I wasn't really convinced with the special effects. Now I know why George Romero and Danny Boyle can really make zombie movies there zombies transforms in the most disgusting and scariest ways. In Legion they transform like this. Their head shakes really rapidly like a bobble head and black contact lens and fake shark teeth. It looks pretty ridiculous. The acting, don't get me started on the acting Paul Bettany was the only shine of light in this movie and it's a pretty dark movie. Most of all the dialogue was dull as well. I do give credit where credits do. Gabriel and Michael in angel form looks pretty cool. Their action sequence was somewhat entertaining. There is good writing here as well the speech that Michael gives to Jeep and a very cool quote that Michael says in the end. \"You gave him what he wanted but I gave him what he needed\" That was pretty cool, as well as the grandma scene was pretty good too. That's four good things out of so many wrong things can't recommend this even to the low IQs."

I didn't think this movie was to slow at all like most people do for some reason. It has a lot of action and a lot of horror all and all the only thing is I think the director could've found a better leading angel but all and all I enjoyed it as well he comes in and saves the baby while the other angel wanted it dead pretty easy to follow. It had the right amount of action and horror and I'm saying I liked it."

I love the majority of them, but would occasionally like to see a new concept born and unleashed on the world. With movies such as Legion and The Book of Eli we can now experience a few new and relatively entertaining movies for the action lovers to enjoy. I want to start the revolution starting today. Lets say enough with the old and in with the new. Not every movie I see needs an oscar worthy performance Christian Bell, calm the heck down and just put one out for the masses. I dont need Terminator 33 directed by McG, dude you suck give it up on the Terminator series and go back to Charlies Angels. Even the likes of Avatar, and original yet seldomly overdone story with amazing visuals and a compeling cast with BA fight scenes. Seriously when Hollywood remakes the Ateam into a movie you know the ideas are running thin. I enjoy brainless action as much as the next but come ON! Whos with me, the movie may not be great but lets get some fresh new movies into the mix SAY I !!!!"

The graphics I thought were decent for this kind of movie but the storyline again is where it makes a difference. Every movie that doesn't do well in the ratings is because the movie either drags or moves to fast to understand anything. This movie didn't start to move until the middle and then it was just information thrown at you. In the end it was confusing to understand what Michael (Paul Bettany) was saying but it made sense after you think hard about it."

The entire show is bogged down by ridiculously wooden and predictable dialogue with stock characters which could be ripped straight out of any other film in the vampire/zombie/apocalypse genre. You never get an explaination why the woman's baby is important and frankly, you just don't care. For a show about angels wiping humans off the face of the earth, you get very little in the way of actual angels appearing on screen. The promise of an entertaining effects fest is wasted by poor lighting and more of that Bay-ultra-closeup nonsense which ensures you have no clue as to whether you're looking at a wing or someone's poorly knit sweater. The only saving grace is a solid turn by Paul Bettany. Chaucer does a good tormented archangel. Too bad he can't save this show's soul from eternal damnation."
