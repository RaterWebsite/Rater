      "text": "Tom Hardy is an absolute powerhouse in Legend and definitely shows an Oscar worthy role. But the film is not without its flaws.\rThe film for the most part more just seems like a continuous amalgamation of instances for Hardy to show off his chops and to focus on him and him only rather than giving an insight into the actual Kray twins. The film doesn\u2019t fully go into any real depth about what they were doing around that time and how they got away with so much, it is more just little mentions here and there as to what is happening and then back to Hardy being a badass in two roles at once. The film felt more like a chronicle of Tom Hardy rather than Kray twins.\rDoes this make the film bad though? NOT AT ALL. The film is fantastic to watch and Tom Hardy alone (and again) makes the viewing captivating, showing he is one of the greatest actors around right now. The realisation that he has chemistry with himself on screen where other actors in other films struggle to have any chemistry at all is truly jaw dropping. You can almost believe you are watching two different actors.\rHardy plays Reggie with such charisma and charm that you can\u2019t help but be encapsulated by him as a person and watch him unfold on screen whereas Hardy playing Ronald is a whole other level. Volatile and explosive, with no clue of what is going on and an outrageous sense of unintentional humour you can\u2019t help but love (and fear) Ronald.\rAnd that is the other thing that makes Legend great. The dark humour is so lovingly layered throughout the film that you find yourself laughing non-stop at some scenes. This, added in with some great symbolism, great dialogue and superb direction (with some brilliant tracking shots) make for a brilliant Hardy piece.\rSo all in all, Legend shows an exceptional Tom Hardy at his best, but doesn\u2019t offer enough material on The Krays as it should. Well worth the watch.\r6.5/10"

      "text": "Proof that you can't have too much of Tom Hardy.\r It is true that glasses and change of hairdo can actually produce a different personality. This movie is mostly dedicated to Tom Hardy delivering his excellent, albeit slightly and funnily schizophrenic, acting prowess. As far as biopic goes, other films such as Black Mass delivers a more in depth-look of the mafia life style, but Legend opts for a direct personal view of the brothers and takes full advantage of the lead actor.\r Tom Hardy plays as both Ron and Reggie Kray, performed with a tweak of facial expression and mild change on make-up. Reggie is the more levelheaded one while Ron can be described as batcrap insane. They are both capable of violence and living a shared gangster life. The events are told by narration from Frances (Emily Browning), Reggie's love interest and a silent witness to the horrible dealings.\r The movie's strongest point is undoubtedly the lead, it is not often that this \"one actor two roles\" is used in cinema recently. Tom Hardy delivers everything expected from him, from the subtle or strong expression, change of speech and mannerism to intricate body language of different characters. Viewers know the twin scene is done by effect, yet they often look like two different persons interacting with each other.\r It dabbles in less criminal activities and more in private life, evident by using Frances a key point for developments even though she is mostly there as spectator, especially when mafia dealings are concerned. Emily Browning is a good addition, she handles her own well, but it's not the level of outlandish on-screen presence like the Krays.\r While there is a definite involvement of crime thriller aspect, it doesn't portray the shady indulgent in its entirety. It\u2019s not the intricate inside view like that of American Heist. There are few violent scenes, although the movie is not a noir gritty musing and some of the events could be done more thoroughly.\r Tom Hardy has done some interesting roles, but none arguably had this level of complexity. Legend further cemented his acting signature on the silver screen, it may not be an in-depth take of criminal enterprise, but he alone, or two of him, is enough to carry the movie."

      "text": "Tom Hardy is excellent as both the Kray Brothers in the mediocre film \u2018Legend\u2019.\r \u2018Legend\u2019 is mediocre because in the way the story is told. It is narrated by Frances Shea, the dead wife of Reginald \u2018Reggie\u2019 Kray. She committed suicide at the age of 24, too young to die but it\u2019s a plot device that doesn\u2019t quite work as she\u2019s telling the story from beyond the grave.\r Tom Hardy does indeed play both Kray Brothers. He\u2019s Reggie, confident, goodlooking, extreme extrovert, who always gets the girl. He\u2019s also Ronald \u2018Ronnie\u2019 Kray, the not-so-goodlooking, introvert, schizophrenic brother, who was also gay. It\u2019s Reggie who seems to hold all the cards and makes most of the most decisions for the brothers, and Hardy goes all out in playing both of these characters. When tough, he\u2019s Reggie, when a bit soft, he\u2019s Ronnie, and when he\u2019s playing either one he\u2019s excellent.\r \u2018Legend\u2019 is based on the book \u2018The Profession of Violence: The Rise and Fall of the Kray Twins\u2019 by John Pearson. The brothers sure did rise, ruling over East London during the 1960\u2019s, ordering killings during the day and then going over to mum\u2019s house for dinner the same evening. They also ran clubs and protection rackets.\r \u2018Legend\u2019 is a slick retelling of the brothers story. Written by Brian Helgeland (L.A. Confidential and Mystic River), the film primarily focuses on Reggie Kray\u2019s relationship with Shea (played a bit overdramatically by Emily Browning), yet downplays any real relationship that Ronnie was involved in. Sure, he had male hangers-on who were presumably with him for his money and power (definitely not for his looks), but it\u2019s all about Reggie and Shea. Their relationship was true love, and while Shea was very young when she started dating Reggie, at age 16, and then they got married when she was 22, and as played by Browning, not everything was right with her mind. Hardy is excellent as both brothers (Hardy has yet to give a bad performance, just this past year he was in \u2018Mad Max: Fury Road\u2019 and \u2018Child 44\u2019 and last year was his best performance to date, as the only character in the film \u2018Locke,\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s a must see). But it\u2019s also a bit distracting watching him play both roles, especially when in scenes together. I kept on looking for irregularities, yet it was a bit obvious that doubles were used, especially in the fight scenes. Anyway, the brothers were imprisoned in 1969 for their long laundry list of murders, which is when their reign of terror ended. Legend was supposed to have been released on October 2 but the film studio felt that that weekend was \u2018bulked up\u2019 with too many guy pics; 20th Century Fox\u2019s \u2018The Martian\u2019 and Sony\u2019s Imax-fueled \u2018The Walk\u2019. So \u2018Legend is now available on DVD."

I'm noticing an odd trend, where period films of the 60s and 70s (e.g., Fargo, second season) portray the period as extremely distant. I happen to remember those periods so the extreme distancing seems dishonest. Anyway, Hardy kept me watching Legend but I was conscious of time elapsing too. It's hard to pinpoint why but the film never fully engaged."

But really, this movie is quite forgetabble, I watched it 2 months ago and barely remember what happened in the middle, besides the bar fight and the ending. I think it could've been a lot better.

The movie really doesn't deviate from the established \"gangster story.\" While this is not necessarily a bad thing, the film meanders and does not build or establish characters in any interesting way. This is a real shame, as Hardy gives a great performance. There is really nothing remarkable at all about Legend, other than Tom Hardy elevating the movie to slightly above average for me. It plays everything way too safe, which is unfortunately Legend's biggest flaw."

      "text": "There are two very good reasons to see and appreciate \u2018Legend\u2019 and they are both Tom Hardy. His dual performances as the Kray twins is nothing short of sensational and he is magnetic in both roles. Aided by some seamless camera trickery he often appears as both brothers in the same frame. Unlike Director Peter Medak\u2019s \u2018The Krays\u2019, which came out in the early 90\u2019s, this film concentrates first and foremost on the brothers themselves rather than building the story around their mother Violet. Here this is well and truly Hardy\u2019s show and Violet is relegated to a very minor role in the story. Even the fine supporting cast are generally over shadowed by Hardy\u2019s tour de force performance although Emily Browning, as Ronnie Kray\u2019s mentally unstable wife Frances, impresses by effectively communicating her character\u2019s fragility via understatement. She also serves as the movie\u2019s narrator.\rThe film looks great with outstanding production design depicting the East End of London during the 60\u2019s. Many hits of the period pep up the soundtrack sharing musical duties with a surprisingly melodic original score. Only the sound seems a tad off in the early stages, but this probably has more to do with the cockney accents of its cast rather than bad mixing by the sound department. As if to confirm this, after about half an hour one\u2019s ears begin to attune to the dialect being spouted. There in after one is able to totally surrender to the film\u2019s vice like grip."

It's not perfect but I can easily say that it's one of the better films in theaters right now. The acting was amazing! Tom Hardy did an amazing job getting into both of his roles as Ron and Reggie Kray. I haven't seen an actor fulfill both his roles so well and with both characters personality's being almost completely different. It's quite an achievement on Tom Hardy's part. Ron Kray's romance side plot felt like it was used only to fill up time. It could have been done better but I can't complain about it that much because it's a true story and I would probably criticize it more if it wasn't included in the movie but It just felt so forced and unneeded. This movie is very dialogue driven and there aren't explosions going on all the time but the dialogue is so captivating that you just get lost in the movie ear/eye candy. I say ear/eye because not only is the screenplay phenomenal but the cinematography even more so. You always feel like you are in 1960's London and never in present day. In the end, legend was pretty awesome. The Writing, chemistry, directing, cinematography and acting are spot on. Some parts did drag on and it was a bit longer then it should've been but besides that. Awesome! I'm giving this one an 8.5/10"

Instead the central character is Frances and the entire story is told from her point of view. You don't get a picture of the criminal world just long love scenes between Reggie and Frances.\r To illustrate it there is a scene where Frances asks Reggie to leave the gangster world and he answers that it's not that simple. And I was sitting there asking - why? If the film had actually shown the Kray's criminal life I could have understood his reasons for saying that. But as it is Reggie and Ron remain a mystery, their stories are never really told.\r Also, and this seems to be a pet peeve of mine lately, the movie is over-narrated. It doesn't just stop at things that need to be explained for people to understand the story it is actively telling and not showing and expecting that to make up for the lacking plot.\r Around 2/3 of the way in I was getting bored with Legend as it didn't deliver in any way. Perhaps it doesn't deserve a score as low as 2/5, perhaps some people will enjoy it a bit more than I did, but what got me the most was that at the end the film actually had gall the to preach their \"morality\" at the viewer. That's what really got me the most.\r Overall the Legend is a mediocre film that's not really as good as the trailers make it out to be."

Hardy completely carries Legend, its a film that is fairly dull, repetitive and overlong without his performance. Emily Browning is pretty strong as the love interest as well and Taron Edgeron from Kingsmen is in this film but he really doesn't have much of a role which was disappointing. Legend seems almost style over substance. The film looks really great but a film that relies so much on the twins storyline the twins really don't have that many good scenes together and their relationship is underdeveloped in favor of an on again off again love story.
