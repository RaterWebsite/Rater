It\u2019s hard for meTo pin point what\u2019s really wrong with this movie because it should have worked but after some real long thought I realized I was putting more effort than the filmmakers.Cast was fine, in fact it was better then this movie deserved but the dialog was bad. Almost like it was written by someone who thinks \u201cyeah this sounds cool\u201d.   At points the one liners where so bad I half expected the music cue from csi Miami to kick in.It\u2019s just kinda bland in terms of cinematography.  The sets were serviceable, and the plot was... meh. Between the average action and bland characters and just horrible dialogue I just realized life was too short and turned it off."

      "text": "A typical Netflix movie, it starts out with a promising story, but that story is then plagued with SJW themes and elements that feel forced and come across in the film as either unauthentic or outright manipulative. The acting is generally good, and Charlize Theron carries most of the weight in this regard. The new immortal introduced early in the film is acted poorly and written horribly, and is thus generally unlikable. While much of the story is a bore fest, overall the movie is OK, and did a good job leaving itself wide open for a sequel by bringing in an intriguing character right at the end that had only been alluded to earlier in the film. 6/10"

      "text": "Welcome back Streamers! This weekend I've chosen continue my quest to guard your eyes and time from middling movie quality. This is why I had to watch The Old Guard. The movie starring Charlize Theron debuted on Netflix this Friday. If you follow our IG page, you saw the trailer, but I've included it below as well. The Old Guard is a movie about a group of \"immortal\" mercenaries that are trying to avoid detection while completing their missions. I know you're intrigued. Sci-fi, action, and Charlize! I'll go ahead and sign you up. But let's see what we got.How many times can we watch an A-Team type of movie? Now, this A-Team can't die. How many times can we watch John Wick-esque violence? Actually, it is just that exactly what you think will happen happens. The trailer says it all. Okay, sure, we can watch this A-Team movie again. We love a rag-tag team completing missions. And yes, we can watch someone kick butt like John Wick all day long. That's what America is built on, violence! You're right! This cast works well together, except the newbie to the crew, KiKi Layne as Nile, added doesn't quite fit the vibe of the others. But I'm sure she will if they decide to do a sequel. *WINK* The problem becomes we've seen this movie before. Action sequences while good are the same as Underworld, Atomic Blonde, John Wick, etc. Those titles actually are a perfect mixture to describe this movie. Don't we deserve more! Then there's the storyline that is extra basic. Has creativity really been this lost even in the sci-fi genre? This just feels like a sad money grab.Ok, I'm going to lay into this one. Allow me some rope. Charlize, what are you doing?! I understand you're picking the same type of roles to play because you're BA... I get it... BUT YOU LITERALLY PLAYED THIS ROLE BEFORE. This movie is just your character in Hancock-you mixed with Bloodshot. I was going to say Wonder Woman mixed with Bloodshot, but then I remembered \"oh wait this is exactly what Charlize did before except she wasn't a housewife.\" Shoot, this might as well be that same character after her husband and stepson died and now she's on a rampage for a couple of centuries. I'm just saying, Charlize, I love ya in a action film, but you can take a break from playing this role for a little bit. You've got more in you than just fighting, getting beat up, killing people, and crying. You were still enjoyable in your monotone BA role. Don't even get me started on you, Chiwetel Ejiofor. Get that check, my guy, but also DO BETTER!Nevertheless, The Old Guard is what you thought it would be. Entertaining action that is sprinkled in between long drawn out predictable storyline sequences. You can keep this on in the background on a Sunday afternoon but otherwise, just stream this if you're bored. A handful of popcorn will be enough to get you through."

But all the the PC stuff felt forced and pulls you out of the story. Also, the pop music they use in this film is out of place and down right ridiculous.Being a woman myself, I'm a big fan of strong female characters, like Ripley in the Alien series and Sarah Connor in T2, just to name a couple. Unfortunately, Charlize Theron was not able to pull it off with her forced tomboyish IDGAF behavior. It just wasn't believable. But kudos to her, she did the best with what she was given.Oh and I do take note what Netflix and the director of this film tried to villainize. But I'm not surprised anymore in 2020."

Walking through deserts without water or a mask in case of a sandstorm? No problem for these blank slates!The CIA is after them to extract hormones so that a cosmetics company can sell immortal juice. Then a fifth jelly fish human becomes immortal, and joins this band of uncharismatic catwalk models. For some reason the US Army has full female squads that have a serious lack of testosterone, but add just enough of that 'Let a woman do a man's job' expression, only to **** it up even worse.Characters can teleport across continents, and have a compass in their brains. Next to that, the \"bad guys\" are also telepathic as they are able to track a bunch of ghosts with no explanation. And if you are a side character, you are useless and just their to comment on how cool the main characters are. So juvenile. Conversations are hollow, with no believable weight behind them. It's like these people have major insecuritie issues, and need constant acknowledging that they are \"good.\" It reminds me so much of Gemini Man. I hate Gemini Man. Question: Why, if they are immortal, do they keep doing things that get them killed? For a bunch of deadly warriors, they aren't very good at staying alive without convenient immortality. They don't question the higher reason behind their immortality, but instead just kill. What a waste. This movie is the definition of contrived, feminist and lazily written fan fiction. It's just entertaining enough that it will keep you interested in seeing where it ends, but it will make you roll your eyes the entire time. It's a terrible movie. I give it a 3/10."

      "text": "Todo potencial do filme \u00e9 ofuscado pela clara decis\u00e3o de girar tudo em torno do resultado, e n\u00e3o trabalhar na premissa de forma geral. Muito comum por parte da Netflix, diga-se de passagem.Imortalidade \u00e9 um tema rico, carregado de ideias desde grandiosidade a melancolia depressiva. Dito isso, sabemos que a abordagem aqui poderia acontecer de diversas formas. Por\u00e9m, ao inv\u00e9s de trabalhar temas do g\u00eanero, o filme resolve entregar o que a maior parte do publico quer ver e tenta ser vago de toda forma poss\u00edvel, para que qualquer um possa entender o que est\u00e1 se passando na tela.Primeiro de tudo, os temas abordados n\u00e3o s\u00e3o ruins, mas a forma como eles s\u00e3o apresentados - de maneira vaga e com uma seriedade ilus\u00f3ria - \u00e9 o que mais me irrita. A obra aborda homossexualidade, emancipa\u00e7\u00e3o, representatividade negra, melancolia, loucura, solid\u00e3o etc; e se eu n\u00e3o conhecesse a netflix, diria que os tr\u00eas primeiros temas ditos acima s\u00f3 tem um espa\u00e7o na obra pra agradar o publico em geral. N\u00e3o h\u00e1 impacto na trama quanto ao relacionamento de Joe e Nicky; A emancipa\u00e7\u00e3o da protagonista, Andy, soa for\u00e7ada e militante, visto que seu desenvolvimento \u00e9 nulo e nunca fica claro o porque ela \u00e9 a BOSS - me desculpem, mas umas cenas de a\u00e7\u00e3o e o fato de que ela \u00e9 a mais velha n\u00e3o me convencem. Inclusive, aquela cena onde os personagens explicam o sonho da Nile, quanto ao passado da Andy, \u00e9 uma forma terr\u00edvel e conveniente de desenvolvimento. [N\u00e3o que a obra tenha alguma verossimilhan\u00e7a. A suspens\u00e3o da descren\u00e7a n\u00e3o funciona pois ora a obra se leva a serio demais, ora ela \u00e9 padr\u00e3o Netflix]. O Plot relacionado ao Sebastiam \u00e9 t\u00e3o mal feito que eu me pergunto: se n\u00e3o acontecesse, faria diferen\u00e7a? E tamb\u00e9m me leva ao questionamento: quem \u00e9 mais ingenuo, este personagem ou James Copley, que realmente acreditava numa \"mafia farmac\u00eautica\" [isso soa t\u00e3o idiota...]. J\u00e1 o vil\u00e3o \u00e9 um estereotipo podre da... industria farmac\u00eautica? da ci\u00eancia? da loucura humana? N\u00e3o sei. Parece que a obra n\u00e3o quer ofender ningu\u00e9m e se perde na caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o do mesmo.O filme tenta meramente abordar melancolia, falta de cren\u00e7a e outros temas relacionados. Mas os di\u00e1logos s\u00e3o pobres e limitados. O mesmo acontece quando tentam p\u00f4r um peso aos personagens - no que se diz respeito a idade deles. Outra coisa que me incomodou foi o \"fan service\" de citar o Brasil. Isso s\u00f3 prova mais uma vez que cinema autoral na netflix est\u00e1 longe de acontecer em diversas obras. S\u00e3o paulo est\u00e1 longe de ser relevante, mas \"vamos mencionar, assim o publico brasileiro fica contente pelos 2s de aten\u00e7\u00e3o.\"As cenas de luta s\u00e3o bem coreografadas. Por\u00e9m, senti falta de um melhor trabalho com a cenografia quanto as coreografias. A cinematografia n\u00e3o \u00e9 muito clara e n\u00e3o passa muito bem a geografia do local. A trilha sonora \u00e9 peculiar. N\u00e3o sei muito bem se essa adi\u00e7\u00e3o de musicas pop funcionam numa obra cinematogr\u00e1fica cujo tema \u00e9 meramente sombrio.Por fim, a Netflix escolhe mais uma vez seguir a formula magica do dinheiro, se distanciando cada vez mais do cinema autoral, e tirando a oportunidade de obras que realmente tenham o que dizer e saibam como o fazer."

I don't know, it very well might have just been the rudimentary dialogue  & Kiki is actually a phenomenal actor. It is honestly hard to tell. The ADR is sloppy & the music is too on the nose. It's easy to tell that the music was chosen specifically because it featured words that described what was happening in the movie, not because the songs actually fit the tone of the moment. If I could give one piece of advice to the creators of this film it would be this, \"Show, don't tell\". By this I mean that you do not need a character verbally explaining or commenting on every single action. There are plenty scenarios that can visually explain things without a character saying \"empty?\" Or repeating another character's statement as a question. Also, the whole thing at the end of a movie where \"the mentor repeating a phrase to the new kid that they said earlier to hint the kid in on the plan\" thing is not only played out, but it made no sense here either. It was a poor call back, & it strategically made no sense. It worked though, because... you know... they're the heroes. Netflix, I'm not mad... I'm just disappointed."

I love the diversity in the cast and even in the characters.I am also all for giving a chance to the directo. However, I can't believe the reviews I am reading from \"reputable\" movie critics. This movie has a lot of holes in a very conventional script. Some ideas are taking from other movies -i.e. \"The Immortals\" everyone?-. Also, some of the lines are just there to give you background stories, not because the plot requires it or the character should be saying that. Another thing that I found very, very poor is the action sequences and the editing. I just couldn't believe what my eyes were seeing considering the actors in it. A very weak, average movie that tries to set up a franchise with nothing to actually feel like it deserves it.Don't believe the great reviews that you are reading from prestigious newspapers. I honestly think they are praising this movie for different reasons not for the quality of the film."

Come on - he's supposed to be a CEO for a successful pharmaceutical company. He comes across as a complete lunatic.The first half of the movie builds up some interesting plot lines to explore. But when it ends it has barely scratched the surface of any of it. It skips merrily along without daring to go dig deeper. And ultimately that kind of ruins the movie as a whole. There's almost no pay-off. It feels like the movie itself doesn't even know the answers.But it hints strongly at a sequel, so maybe they just decided to not reveal any of it in the first one. Kind of silly if you ask me.It was entertaining enough. But the characters often strayed too much from what I could bring myself to believe they'd ever do or how they'd react to the situations they are in. And the amount of \"I can't tell you that right now, so I'll just do something stupid to avoid answering\" was off the charts.Yeah, so not a bad movie. It just doesn't do much with the potential it has for something better or more interesting."

But I enjoyed it, the way it was presented was done in a smart way, making you understand these characters were intended to have some depth. But then it all started to feel like a clich\u00e9. Super predictable. The betrayals and twists. The greedy villain with millions in the bank, a mercenary army for hire and zero depth to his character (we needed another one of these right?). The music used was dreadful (low quality EDM really?) and didn't match any scenes. The fight sequences with blades or blunt weapons felt far fetched but I have to say Charlize did look cool holding her axe. The dialogue was also very weak at certain points.As positives, some acting was good, and you do feel curious about the history and power of the characters. I really liked the relationship between Nick and Joe, and would have loved to see some flashbacks to its start back in the crusades. Felt curious about the character in the flashback, that is dying with Andy and Quynh next to him, but there was no explanation for this moment. I felt like he knew more information about the immortality powers and had been around even before Andy, nonetheless we are left wondering.Maybe it will be mentioned in the sequel?Will still give it a rating of 3 since it has some enjoyable moments and I would watch a sequel, regardless of the various moments that made me cringe."

Okay, I guess they must be up against something serious.....vampires, demons, terminator-style robots? No....basically it's them against Martin Shkreli, the PharmaBro.I have no idea how a writer and director can take a talented cast and huge budget and still turn in something so unimaginative, derivative and boring. At the beginning I thought to myself, \"How cool would it be if this was a stealth Highlander reboot\" and they'd completely hidden it from people until release. Unfortunately not. It's apparently based on a graphic novel and has none of the heart, drama or uniqueness of the earlier movie. Overpowered main characters kills waves of faceless drones in a story that seems like it would work as a pilot for a tv series (where you would hope the seasonal arc would introduce antagonists of actual weight) but as a movie It is a by-the-numbers as they come."
