Done properly, in order (origin-crisis-resolution) at a slower pace, it could have been a nice supernatural/steam-punk western with a deformed bounty hunter from hell who can talk to dead people, his horse Horse, his ugly dog, his incredible tight-waisted sidekick Whora Croft (Megan Fox) and the 19th century A-bomb. However, this jumbled mess makes even \"Wild Wild West\" look competently made. A waste of a talented cast destroyed by the horrible direction."

      "text": "While it's not as bad as some reviews might lead you to believe, it still fails because of a poor screenplay. All the more disappointing to me when I learned that Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor (the guys behind the brilliantly bonkers Crank) wrote it. It's a shame they couldn't make more of what is very good source material. Despite the poor screenplay, I made it through the full 80 or so minutes simply because it's fairly well directed (at times the film looks beautiful) and the action set-pieces do entertain, especially a brilliant but brief train robbery in the opening minutes. It's the bits inbetween the action that hold Jonah Hex down. That, and some pretty godawful CGI, which to be fair, isn't terrible throughout the film, but very noticeable when it is. There is a good film in here somewhere, and at times we can catch a glimpse of it, but in the end this really feels like a missed opportunity."

I'm pretty new to this \"graphic novel\" concept but I'd have to say the running time of 1 hour and 20 minutes captivated me from start to finish. As as veteran movie enthusiast (I'm over 60), I thought it surprising original. A good cast, supernatural elements , and \"high tech artillery\", it's not your father's western. Admittedly, the playback levels were a bit high ( controllable by the projectionist) but the sound design added much realism to this new \"genre\". I certainly liked it a lot more than most of the over-hyped big studio productions released over the last two weeks. \"Thumbs up\" for me !"

      "text": "From his 2008 novel \"Man in the Dark\", Paul Auster writes: \"In the men's room, he finally took the trouble to examine the money and was encouraged to see the face of Ulysees S. Grant engraved on the front of the bill.\" Owen Brick, the man in the dark, wakes up one day, inexplicably, staring up from a hole. In the other America, there was no 9/11, no war with Iraq. This America of August Brill's making has state after state breaking away from the union after George W. Bush was sworn into office. And while some things may remain the same(Grant on the fifty-dollar bill), there are differences that makes this \"weird world roll on.\" The weird world rolls on in \"Jonah Hex\", too. Set in the civil war, this alternative western, because of its graphic novel pedigree, doesn't play like a descendant of Ned Buntline's play about Buffalo Bill(\"The Scouts of the Prairie\"), and the \"shoot 'em up\" novels of Zane Grey and Max Brand, which lent the film genre its template. Because Jonah Hex(Josh Brolin) was originally a comic book character, not only is the cowboy an anti-hero; he's also an anti-superhero, as well. He has two daddies: John Wayne and Superman. When President Grant asks for the services of the confederate soldier-turned-bounty hunter, it's like Jimmy Carter forming a partnership with The Man of Steel, had Richard Lester's \"Superman\" employed the former peanut farmer instead of a generic commander-in-chief. In this other America, Eli Whitney left behind plans for fiery orange balls, and it's of considerable significance that Colonel Turnbull carries out Whitney's superweapon designs to fruition. The science is incongruous to its time period. American Atheist leader Maddalyn Murray O'Hair often liked to say that we'd have a man on the moon, as early as the nineteenth century, was it not for the church's influence. That's why the science in \"Jonah Hex\" fascinates. The scientifically advanced cannonball hints at the absence of god. This other America has the potential of putting a man on the moon; this other America with its alternative Eli Whitney, presumably has an alternative Leonardo DaVinci, as well."

However it's shoddily edited, underwritten and lacking character.  Malkovich sleepwalks his way through his role, Fox looks great but is given very little to work with and Brolin is wasted with barely a memorable line.  At 80mins, it's obviously been cut down, with all the violence cut out - it so nearly could have been a guilty pleasure."

It's a supernatural western (as it's supposed to be) and it's a lot of bad ass gun slingin' action. If you're looking for an Academy Award type western, then this ain't for you. If you're looking for a good western flick with a lot of cool scenes and dialogue then you need to see Jonah Hex.  Fans of The outlaw Josy Wales and The Good the Bad and the Ugly should enjoy this movie just fine. A great movie for folks who like action, Westerns, and some cool lines that you'll actually find yourself looking for a reason to use them.It's a great movie."

The movie started off okay, but then, it ended up falling flat. It was a total waste of a good cast, and, the dialogue seemed to swim around in cheese. In fact, this whole movie seemed to swim in cheese. So now, Jonah Hex is now in the lot of movies like \"The Adventures of Pluto Nash\", \"Heaven's Gate\" and \"Cutthroat Island\" as one of the biggest flops of all time."

I really don't see how the 2015 mad max is really so much better than this movie, they're really very similar and if one deserves raves reviews so should the other.\r Be very careful about movie review rating.

The action sequences and fight scenes are decent, the acting is good enough, and the character's back story is interesting. The execution of it all is poor and this is one of the few movies where it's nice that it's so short. The movie was about 70 minutes... much longer and it would've stunk. One of the only bright spots is Megan Fox. She always gets a bad rap from the critics for some reason but she's a capable actress that is never the weakest one on screen. She is stunning though and that never hurts. Overall, I don't think this is a story that translates well to the big screen. Talking to dead people, being nearly invincible, and crows helping you along your way may work in the comic books but on film it just feels silly."

      "text": "Michael Fassbender steals the show in this awful movie as an evil henchman while Josh Brolin struggles to be the reluctant antihero.  Brolin plays a former Confederate officer who rises from the dead and gets all kinds of powers in the bargain. He seeks to exact revenge on the bad guy,  Turnbull, played by John Malkovich. To up the stakes Turnbull, also a former Confederate Generall, intends to destroy the Union.I wonder where we have seen that before...This movie reminds me of Wild Wild West. It has the same kind of story, it has also good actors - not counting Will Smith - and is equally disastrous. The main difference is that Wild Wild West became what it wants to be, even if it was bad at it, but Jonah Hex became nothing, and was equally bad at that as well. On the one hand, this movie seems to go for a grim mood like Sin City. Sin City uses contrasts to underscore the personalities and the action. The comic itself is even done in black and white to highlight the contrasts. It is powerful, it is grim and it works.On the other hand, Jonah Hex goes for nonsense.  The villain plots to destroy the United States with a super cannon that fires nukes as shells and the president needs the help of Hex to stop the evil guy.  And how about the two Gatling guns strapped to a horse?  These are the trappings of a comedy.And there you have a major problem. These two opposites tend to cancel each other out. It is just hard to be grim and funny at the same time. Hell, some movies have just issues with being one or the other. Like Wild Wild West; it wants to be funny but it isn't.The greatest sin, however, is that there is no attempt to make us care. It is telling that the person I liked most was Fassbender's evil henchman and he was just in the movie for a few minutes.   The ultimate challenge for any story is that it should make you care. And this movie fails to do so."
