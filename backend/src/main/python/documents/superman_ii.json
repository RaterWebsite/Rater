However, I do think that this is a very good movie.  This movie was made back in a time when people thought superheroes were more romantic and silly than anything else (if you want another movie like that, all three of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man movies).  This movie is a perfect movie that shows what superheroes were like during that era.  I believe that the main reason a lot of people do not like this film as much as they used too is merely because this is the era of more grown up superhero movies (Christopher Nolan's Batman movies) which are much darker.  Superman II is definitely the perfect movie for romantic superhero fans.  It is very charismatic and heroic at the same time.  It has a simple plot with villains threatening to take over the world, but the hero always triumphs in the end, and also gets the girl.  While this plot is simple, so were the original Spider-Man movies which came out much later.  Probably my only real complaint about this movie is that even though the romantic hero plot was good for the time, it is a little outdated now, as more grown up superhero movies have been released.  I still think that this a great movie nonetheless."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Although the original Superman will always be the strongest in my eyes, I still really quite enjoyed this film. With a montage to start the film off, just in case you have forgotten anything from the previous film, but this film is simply just fun, and the most entertaining thing for me was watch Lois lane and Superman play off each other and see how their relationship developed.\r That and General Zod of course, who is a truly great villain played by the one and only Terence Stamp. I will be interested to see Michael Shannon's take of the character in Man of steel... Had to mention it at some point. It's a Superman review.\r And it is Superman week. Lets face it.\r The main problem I had with the film is that I felt that there were some bits that felt too placed, and could have been cut out completely. The film does seem to drag in the middle a little bit which could arguably be down to the troubled production, with a switch of director in the middle of production from Richard Donner to Richard Lester. This resulted in a problem with the tone of the film, as Donner wanted a dark film while Lester tried to add in a lot of slapstick- which to be honest were the bits that dragged the film down- what I would call the silly parts, when the film suddenly becomes a cartoon for a few minutes.\r I will be interested to see Richard Donner's cut.\r I enjoyed Superman 2, although it doesn't have the same magic of the first one it is still a great superhero film."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Although this was even more cheesy than the first Superman, it still has a great amount of cool that made this movie a decent sequel.

Clark Kent (Christopher Reeve) is back, and must now face his toughest enemy yet, General Zod (Terrence Stamp), while Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) thinks that she might be closer to the identity of Superman than she thinks. Overall, 'Superman II' is still a visually stunning sequel, with a great story wrapped in there, the execution may be clunky in a few places, but you will have fun with it."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Well, to (hopefully) clear a few things up a) Metacritic \"weighs\" some reviews to count for more than others. I don't necessarily agree with it but it's the fact of things. b) There are a lot of movies that exist here that didn't make the all time highest scores despite their 99's or similar scores (The Seven Samurai, Fanny And Alexander, Modern Times) For a long time Superman II was one of them, I'm not sure what happened. But to the movie itself, it's not bad.

I don't know how on Earth this film got a 5.8 User Score. This was also the most interesting, as Superman finally had someone who could really challenge him and he doesn't always emerge victorious.

In every way. Given that these movies are upwards of 40 years old now, we can forgive the aging of the effects, surely. Doesn\u2019t take a genius to realise that technology was limited in 1980. However, this film manages to be dazzling all the same, and does not deserve this user score. It\u2019s a 10, and I hope my 10 drags the score up a little. Far better than the first. Far far far better. Pacing is perfect, no boring parts like the first one. Just so much better than the first.

One of the biggest reasons would probably be the villains. They are a physical match for superman so they pose more of a threat than lex luthers so called intelligence. Since supermans new villains can fly there is one really good scene of them battling it out and throwing large objects at each other and fighting while flying. The dated special effects add a cheese factor but its really fun to watch. There is also a very cool scene on the moon that felt very sci-fi like, this was a great scene i thought looked very cool. These two things were in my opinion better than anything that happened in the origonal. On the negative side though there was some pretty stupid plot elements that might be hard for some people to look passed, i personally just laughed and shrugged it off. One thing i found funny was how supermans mom tells him he can turn into a human but will never be able to regain his old powers and then he easilly gets his powers back using the green crystal, that was ridiculous, also lex luthers escape from jail in a hot air balloon was silly. Overall superman 2 is a cheesy good time i found more entertaining than the first"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "INCREDIBLE SEQUEL, Truly better than the first it ups the ante by adding General Zod and having (Once Again) Lex Luthor in the mix (played Excellently by Gene Hackman) truly a Magnificent film"}, {"rating": "5", "text": "I don't really see how this achieved a 99....and I understand what others have said about viewing the rating with respect to the 'Superhero Genre\" but I still don't buy how that should give it the 2nd highest score of all time....It is a decent movie at best..."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "This is my people dont like critics, this is a terrible movie it. it makes no logical sense, the plot is terrible and the acting is terrible. wow, there must have been a lot of blow on the table when this thing was written and twice as much when it was reviewed."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "Having just watched the Richard Donner cut, I don't get it. 99?

The actual implementation has much to be desired.  The special effects are awful in context with the times.  The fight scenes are laughable.
