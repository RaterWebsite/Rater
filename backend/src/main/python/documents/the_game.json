Shortly after he sees him odd events start happening to him.\rHe doesn't know why the events are happening but apparently it's part of the game. To uncover the\robject of the game defeats it's purpose. Overall a tightly wound thriller from the director of Fight Club,\rDavid Fincher."

Whether if it's the action, the thrill, the mystery, or even the drama, The Game is guaranteed to give you a good experience. The idea behind this movie was well-thought and portrayed expertly, along with superb acting. However I still wish that this whole movie had much more meaning, it seems absent from the previous thought put into it in the end. But nonetheless, The Game, in my opinion, is a must-see. And do not let the critics tell you otherwise."

      "text": "The opening scenes of \"The Game'' show Michael Douglas as a rich man in obsessive control of his life. The movie seems to be about how he is reduced to humility and humanity--or maybe that's just a trick on him. The movie is like a control freak's worst nightmare. The Douglas character, named Nicholas Van Orton, is surrounded by employees who are almost paralyzed by his rigid demands on them. \"I have an Elizabeth on line three,'' says one secretary, and then a second later adds, \"Your wife, sir.'' \"I know,'' he says coldly. We have the feeling that if the second secretary had not spoken, he would have replied, \"Elizabeth who?'' His underlings are in no-win situations. It is, in fact, his ex-wife; at age 48, Van Orton lives alone in the vast mansion where his father committed suicide at the same age. His birthday evening consists of eating a cheeseburger served on a silver tray and watching CNN.\r Of course many of the physical details of what happens to him are implausible or even impossible, but so what? The events are believable in the sense that events can be believed in a nightmare: You can hardly worry about how a horror has been engineered when you're trapped inside it.\r \"The Game,'' written by John Brancato and Michael Ferris, is David Fincher's first film since \"Seven,\" and projects the same sense of events being controlled by invisible manipulation. This time, though, there's an additional element: Van Orton is being broken down and reassembled like the victim of some cosmic EST program. And it is unclear, to him and to us, whether the Game is on the level of a fraud, or perhaps spinning out of control.\r The movie's thriller elements are given an additional gloss by the skill of the technical credits, and the wicked wit of the dialogue. When Van Orton's brother asks, \"Don't you think of me anymore?'' he shoots back, \"Not since family week at rehab.'' And when his ex-wife asks if he had a nice birthday, he answers, \"Does Rose Kennedy have a black dress?'' The film's dark look, its preference for shadows, recalls \"Seven'' and also Fincher's \"Alien 3.\" The big screen reveals secrets and details in dark corners; on video, they may disappear into the murk. Like \"Seven,'' the plotting is ingenious and intelligent, and although we think we know the arc of the film (egotist is reduced to greater humility and understanding of himself), it doesn't progress in a docile, predictable way; for one thing, there is the real possibility that the Game is not an ego-reduction program, but a death plot.\r Douglas is the right actor for the role. He can play smart, he can play cold, and he can play angry. He is also subtle enough that he never arrives at an emotional plateau before the film does, and never overplays the process of his inner change. Indeed, one of the refreshing things about the film is that it stays true to its paranoid vision right up until what seems like the very end--and then beyond it, so that by the time the real ending arrives, it's not the payoff and release as much as a final macabre twist of the knife."

I always love when movies move me mentally or maybe even physically, this is a movie that messes with you, when you're watching this movie it makes you paranoid just like the leading man Van Orton, which is a rare feat, it's a special experience which i always love. Movies like The Truman show, The Prestige, Shutter Island, A Beautiful Mind, and Black Swan, are some of my favorite movies, what they have in common with The Game is that they all move the audience mentally and maybe even physically, they mess with you, which is a movie experience i like or even dislike when it's done incredibly well. This is one of them. It's executed so well it made me paranoid whilst watching and maybe the occasional nightmare. (I had a nightmare i was put in The Game, as well)\rPhenomenal.\r The Game is an incredibly intense psychological thriller."

      "text": "Dangerous games.This film tells how Nicholas Van Orton, a smug and cold millionaire, enters a bizarre and unique game that promises to play with his life. But when the game starts and Nicholas sees the twisted and perverse way unfolds, things start getting out of control. Directed by David Fincher (director of the film \"Seven\"), features Michael Douglas as protagonist.The truly wealthy have always had a reputation for being arrogant people, cold, impersonal, smug and only concerned about themselves and their business. Nicholas Van Orton was like that, even disregarding his own brother. And it is from him that Nicholas receives a different birthday gift: participation in a game organized by a mysterious company that everyone seems to know but about which nothing is said nowhere. Intrigued but afraid, Nicholas boards the game without real sense of where he is in, which says a lot about the personality of some rich people. The film will thicken up gradually, leaving the audience in anticipation and securing it constantly. It is an addictive movie where Douglas shows all its value and can brilliantly interpret your character. All this makes this film an excellent thriller, perhaps one of the best of the late twentieth century."

The Game is a smart, capable thriller that earns its slick, dark appearance. It's cast is at first competent and quickly grows into a universally interesting group of faces. The plot is layered in a great execution of a wonderfully novel premise: how much of this horror story is the game? The Game earns every inch that it takes, and while it is far-fetched, you can't sit down to watch a movie about an organization that uses conspiracies and mobs of actors to infiltrate and ruin your entire life without suspending disbelief. The Game deserves that suspension, thanks to superb suspense."

The massive flaw is when he washes up in what I assume to be Mexico. The movie wastes so much potential and becomes a very contrived. How do you plan for Douglas not to go crazy and just start blasting people ? The gun might be fake , but that just makes the stakes so much lower. The ending is so disappointing and it leaves a sour taste in my mouth because I really loved the first few acts. It makes the entire movie feel pointless , and I get that he becomes a \u201cbetter person \u201c because he \u201chas fun\u201d now but that is so wack compared to a story that actually had stakes, and god damn if the movie ended with him falling off the building it would have been a 10, but nope need that Hollywood happy ending.

      "text": "In a dark, dangerous San Francisco lives Nicholas Van Orten (Michael Douglas), a very rich businessman and a total loner. He doesn\u2019t come across as pathetic, but as rather as stern and cold, and blatantly unhappy despite the lap of luxury in which he lives. Sensing Nicholas\u2019 unhappiness, Nicholas\u2019 wild and \u00fcber ostentatious brother Conrad (Sean Penn) appears and presents Nicholas a birthday gift, a gift that is sure to add some excitement to Nicholas life, and lift him out of the depressive fog that he carries around everywhere.\r Along the way we learn some little bits of information about Nicholas\u2019 life, but not much, which is nice because his past doesn\u2019t really seem to matter anyway. Fincher takes the character and forces him to deal strictly with the present time. All past regrets, misdeeds, and sins fall away when you are literally fighting for your life.\r Conrad\u2019s gift is a game. A set of real life, role-playing scenarios designed and executed by a company alleged called CRS. We don\u2019t know what CRS is, and neither does Nicholas, so when bizarre happenings start to occur, such as the nightly news anchor breaking character and speaking directly to Nicholas in his living room, Nicholas cannot tell what is really happening. Is this part of the game? Or am I hallucinating?\r Soon the puppet masters at CRS crank up the intensity of the events. There are numerous attempts on Nicholas\u2019 life. At one point he wakes up in Mexico after having been buried alive in an underground tomb. The occurrences are so extreme, that as an audience, we are just as confused as Nicholas. It is real? Or is it a game? It is impossible to tell, and this is what makes this film so much fun to watch.\r The world that CRS tailors to its clients is very cool and well put together. Even though Nicholas is told distinctly that the CRS game will begin, and it is not until after he is told this that strange and dangerous things start to happen, we are still unsure if it\u2019s game or reality. Fincher is essentially blurring our understanding of the common philosophical conventions of cause and effect.\r The Game is a good thriller, and an entertaining watch. The production value of the film is excellent. It projects on screen in dark, shadowy tones, mixed with diverse textures setting one scene to next to a another composed completely different. The film is full of interesting settings from Nicholas\u2019 mansion, to a Mexican border town, to meetings in coffee shops, to cabins in the woods, but despite the actual events taking place being very entertaining to watch, the film never really establishes what truth it is trying to convey. The ending is disappointing. We are not left with any kind of substantial meaning.\r The CRS experience is meant to be a massive, over-the-top shock to the nervous system. This shock forces one, Nicholas in this case, to decide whether he wants to fight to stay alive, or let go and die. Maybe we are supposed to take the hint and choose to live now, even though we don\u2019t have CRS to break us out of our depression and lethargy, as individuals, or as a whole society. But this might be pushing the limits of interpretation. Despite the absence of the deeper themes, such as investigating the pointlessness of existence as in Fight Club, or the proving the worthlessness of humanity as in Seven, The Game is still great watch. Once the film ends, it doesn\u2019t linger for days in the front of your mind like the best thrillers, but while your watching it you\u2019ll be on the edge of your seat, never knowing what it going to happen next."

However, enjoyment is not enough for us we need to challenge ourselves further, step up the game so to speak, so we push our limits to try new games we know nothing about   and try to master them.  Each time we play, we get better and better until soon enough no one can beat us. So what do you do when you stop playing the game and the game starts playing you? David Fincher's \"The Game\" is a brilliant and ingenious mind teaser that takes peoples love for gaming to a completely new and terrifying level. So when you are playing a game ask yourself one very important. Are you playing it or is it playing you?   David Fincher is a master at toying with peoples minds at creating a complex and dark story weaved around the deep confines of the human mind, Fincher does not wimp out on you, he does not hold anything back he does not give into mainstream Hollywood. No, Fincher creates stories that are so dark an depraved that  only a fan of David Lynch, Stanley Kubrick or Tim Burton even could  stand the  full frontal brutality of Lynch's determination, hey maybe even some mainstream audiences members could handle his films I've meet a few who can.  David  Fincher's second homage to the noir genre \"The Game\" is not one of his most focused efforts or even one of his best but  what it is is one of the  biggest mind games you will ever be apart of. I liked the clammy, macabre feel of this film I liked how it bathed in bleached out colors or complete and utter darkness to bring out the full effect of the films story. It is a good film, no a great film with a fantastic story that works, and a premise that is more believable than preposterous.   \"The Game\" is a masterful film, a brilliant example of feverish essence in dark filmmaking, what undoes all the excellent work in this film is an ending so fluffy it makes you feel extremely cheated; it completely unravels all the extreme tension set up by the first two acts. It insults you that you spent 1hr.55 min and then the ending does not live up to the films story or even talent in it.  I will say this in its favor it did do an excellent job of keeping me involved and intrigued and this film was saved from its terrible ending by first-rate performances, eerie atmosphere and sharp direction from David Fincher. \"The Game\" is enjoyable and menacing ride that may run out of steam it does not let you down form the beginning until the end.   Michael Douglas is a fantastic actor he has given some of the greatest performances I have ever seen his most well know is as Gordon Gekko (His Oscar winning role.)

The book unfortunately did not seem to cross over to the film enough. that is not to say that key bits were missed or the film was not true to the text. It was just that I did not feel that the film fleshed out the book enough. Some of the key moments where people are brought into the story seemed to be better paced in the book and a bit rushed in the film.\rThe plot of the book is an intriguiging one and it is kept whole by the film. Douglas plays a rich business man, very self obsessed and not really caring for anyone around him. His kind of unstable/wacky/do anything once brother gives him a random birthday present. A Game... I won't explain too much incase I spoil the film but its an interesting tale.\rThe film just did not add any real tension for me. I can't put my finger on why. I think it was maybe a character portrayal thing or the pacing of the film. In the book I genuinely felt for the character and the way the Game affected those involved.  You may say knowing the plot may spoil it but sometimes knowing what is coming can Add tension and it just felt flat.\rI would say its worth a watch but I would not say to seek it out."

      "text": "The Game is making an attempt to confuse the audience and it invited the viewer to consider whether the main character is actually part of a crazy game (which he has payed for) or whether he is being deceived. The movie is at first challenging (which is awesome) and throughout it you will ask yourself whether he is still participating in the game or in something else. It sounds like a great movie indeed!\r However, the Game is a relatively mediocre movie for one main reason! It doesn't make any sense and it is therefore far from logical. The story is full of gaps and holes...It is true that a movie doesn't have to be logical and make perfectly sense, but the Game is trying soooo hard to be a 'smart' movie. At first it appears that it is...That is until you realise that the Game isn't even making an attempt to explain and bind together the strings of the plot. If the game had allocated 6-10 minuted in the end for this purpose, it could have been a real brainteaser and earned itself at least 7.5.\r Overall it is a decent movie but it is NOT the smart/well thought out movie it is trying to be, this is due to the above-mentioned!"

      "text": "'The Game': Absurdly Inspired.\r You have to hand it to David Fincher, whose elegant direction made a 10 out of \"Seven.\" He performs a similar transformation on \"The Game,\" a mystery thriller that is -- depending on your perspective -- creatively challenging or just plain wacko.\r With Michael Douglas in the lead, it\u2019s no surprise that the story stands squarely in the Hollywood character workshop for super-yuppies. As Nicholas Van Orton, he\u2019s a San Francisco investment banker worth millions, whose human relationships are less than liquid. He\u2019s divorced. He\u2019s only occasionally in touch with his kid brother, Conrad (Sean Penn), who has his share of behavioral problems. And thanks to repetitive flashbacks, we learn that, as a child, Nicholas witnessed his 48-year-old father leap to his death. Nicholas lives alone with his father\u2019s housekeeper (Carroll Baker) in a castle-cum-prison of a home. It\u2019s clearly time for this \u201990s Scrooge to get in touch with his inner bile and learn valuable lessons about himself and people.\r When Nicholas turns 48, his brother gives him a one-of-a-kind birthday present: a gift certificate for CRS, or Consumer Recreation Services. But when Nicholas shows up to CRS\u2019s glass tower office to claim his good time, he\u2019s submitted to a physical exam, and a barrage of questionnaires about his financial status, personal history and hobbies. He\u2019s even asked to provide responses to pictures. (\"Woops,\" says our control freak, looking at a car flying off a cliff.)\r Exasperated by the rigorous tests, Nicholas is further mortified to learn that his \"application\" to CRS has been rejected. And yet, signs come up that indicate maybe he is in the game -- whatever that may be.\r Did CNN newsman Daniel Schorr just mention his name on the airwaves? Did that waitress (Deborah Van Unger) purposely spill drinks all over him? And why -- when the waitress is fired on the spot -- does an anonymous waiter slip Nicholas a note which says \"Don\u2019t let her get away\"? Nicholas is drawn inexorably into a dangerous game where the rules are not apparent, and where he can never tell if he\u2019s being put through a gag or his life is in danger.\r \"The Game,\" written by John Brancato and Michael Ferris, is an elaborately constructed crock. But it plays enjoyable, postmodern footsie with the paranoia-infused thrillers of the 1970s, such as \"Three Days of the Condor\" and \"The Parallax View.\" It\u2019s formulaic, yet edgy. It\u2019s predictable, yet full of surprises. How far you get through this tall tale of a thriller before you give up and howl is a matter of personal taste. But there\u2019s much pleasure in Fincher\u2019s intricate color schemes, his rich sense of decor, his ability to sustain suspense over long periods of time and his sense of humor. And frankly, no one plays a jaded Master of the Universe better than Douglas. There\u2019s something compelling about watching what will happen to him, whether you\u2019re rooting for his redemption or hoping against hope that he\u2019ll hang himself with one of those silk ties."

The idea of creating a Hitchcock-style suspense plot looked good from the surface; the intention was good even though the plot is not entirely perfect. What is appreciated is that the film manages to keep the viewer's attention. For a weekend evening."

      "text": "I use the word \"bratty\" for the way it is endorsed, there is no thrill if there is no empathy.The GameFincher's bratty film is in no way near the genre it claims for. Not thrilling, nor mysterious, no drama. The only possible way it would fall under the section \"crime\" is if we arrest it for forging the documents on applying it under those above mentioned genres. That was way too harsh. So I should take some heat off and put someone worthy on the stand. And it is not the director David Fincher. He shouldn't be blamed at all. I wouldn't even call it his choice. And instead it is the writer whose desperate pointless venture of creating a mind bending experience for the viewers fails repeatedly in the film.And it grows annoying to be honest, after a while. The eye opening revelations are hair pulling disasters where the predictability is just a cherry on top. Where the only thing sad above the fact that Fincher has to keep all this mess togethers, is that someone talented as Michael Douglas has to go through the banal set of rules for The Game.Mostly, I find people around me gushing over the nail biting climax and to be honest I don't mind the old flip and turn show. I couldn't care less. No matter how much hard Christopher McQuarrie tries in Mission Impossible: Fallout, he could barely draw out a nod from me. But that is only because we know that those fireworks won't ever glorify your night. The real crux is on how clean and precise you are on spiraling out the web of lies. Especially a film like this that has to keep its audience in the dark all the time. And that is why I love the first act of the film, it is properly polished, beautifully edited and smartly directed. The obvious things never go loud and if they do, they are intended to be."

      "text": "This movie starts very weak, but ends very strong. You just have to accept that the game makes no sense and that it's totally dependant on things no one could possibly predict or control. Once you accept that, it's a lot of fun to just go along with this film.As I mentioned earlier, the first half (and maybe a bit more) isn't the best. Becuase there's apparently only so much you can do with the premise of an alternate reality game gone too far, it becomes pretty repetitive very quickly. However, once Michael Douglass wakes up in Mexico, the film picks up again and becomes better than ever.It's not one of David Fincher's best movies (in fact, I would say it's his weakest film, not counting Alien 3), but his direction is so good and the thrid act so bonkers that I have to reccomend it."

The very thought through \"The Game\" is creepy and unexpecting with thrills and near death experiences at almost every corner. The acting is impeccable; this is one of Michael Douglas's best roles. The Game takes the viewer through a world where nothing is certain, and executes it quite well. Whether if it's the action, the thrill, the mystery, or even the drama, The Game is guaranteed to give you an exceptional viewing experience. The idea behind this movie was well-thought and portrayed expertly, along with superb acting. The Game, in my opinion, is a must-see."
