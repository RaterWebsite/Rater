The animation is so beautiful and detailed, the score is wonderful and once the story really kicks in the script subtly shifts in tone from comedy/drama to melancholy. There's some obvious parallels at work here, male/female city/country but they are handled subtly and mostly tend to avoid predictability. Ultimately you'd have to have a heart of stone not to be moved by this."

It is like a cross of two film tropes, the first being body-swapping between two people, seen in films such as Freaky Friday and Like Father Like Son, while the second trope is a spoiler. ### Move to the next paragraph now to skip this spoiler. ### The second trope is seen in a Korean film called Il Mare and its American remake called Lake House.>Pros:>1. The concept of the film is rather complex as it merges Japanese culture and its beliefs with the tropes of body-swapping and one other sci-fi trope that is a spoiler. As a result, it is a film that requires a bit of attention. However, the reward at the end is well worth it. If you are into those three elements, then you\u2019ll love this film. However, see Cons #1.>2. I saw the American animated film, Sing, a day after watching this. The gulf in the complexity of the artwork is immense. For example, for a tree, you will see the outlines of the tree, the branches and the trunk in Sing, while the same tree in Your Name has individual leaves. Imagine the effort required to hand draw these. Imagine the effort required to animate them when there is wind! Everything is so beautifully drawn!>3. The use of the second trope in the middle of the film elevates this film from an average-good film to a good-excellent film.>4. Comedic elements covering childhood fantasies, high school angst and dating difficulties were used throughout the film to make this a partial comedy. They are very well done and they break the language barrier for the international audience.>Cons: >1. The complexity of this film makes it harder for younger children or older adults to understand it fully.2. The major problem close to end of the film was solved with a dues ex machina that was not properly explained. It need not be that way.>How would the different age groups rate it?Children: GoodTeenagers: ExcellentYoung adults: ExcellentMedium age adults: ExcellentOld adults: Good.My rating: 5/5 (no half scores). It's worth it to watch it in the cinemas and then buy the DVDs."

I watch anime series more than anime movies and this one was one of the anime films i have watched. This was a very beautiful film to watch and while it wasn't as good as other anime movies like Sprited Away or Grave of the Fireflies, it still kept my eyes glued to the screen til the end.  The visuals were so great to look at. In fact, these were the best part of this film. The characters were likable. The voice actors did a very good job potraying their characters.

Director Makoto Shinkai gives us an excellent movie, that you can probably nit-pick, but I felt the raw power and emotion in this film and you can tell that Shinkai has done a loving job crafting this film.  Many people have put a lot of emphasis on the body swapping element of the film, which is very well done, but I think it also has the effect of cheapening the rest of the film which is also done brilliantly,  It\u2019s a story of love, regret, and overcoming disaster and adversity and finding the solution when it seems impossible.  It\u2019s one brilliant film and if it doesn\u2019t get a nomination for Best Animated Feature at the Oscars, I will be extremely annoyed.  I\u2019m really looking forward to whatever Makoto Shinkai brings out next since this beautiful animated film is easily his best work to date. Oh and the soundtrack released by the band The Radwimps is fantastic. It\u2019s not currently available, but it will be soon.  Please, please try to see this film, even if you\u2019re not into anime, because I think it will surprise you"

      "text": "(Kimi No Na Wa) tells the story of two teenagers with vastly different backgrounds. One is a boy who lived in Tokyo and has the word \"city\" described all around him. One is a girl who lived in rural town far from technology and anything interesting. One morning, somehow, they found out that they have swapped bodies. Together, they must help each other find solution in daily life problems, and solve the mystery of the reason why this whole conundrum started.This may sound like your typical body-swap romantic comedy situation, but you may find yourself on the wrong side of the spectrum as this movie takes you into an incredible journey. With a storytelling so divine, complex, yet understandable, this movie captures the essence of what romantic comedy movies have lost nowadays, a heart and a charm to lure you in.Japanese animation movies tend to have a bit of a stereotype, but the movie successfully shown very little of that. Transitioning from one scene to the other effortlessly, Radwimps deserves an incredible applause for their talents in the movie, as every song and every score fits perfectly to the scene currently shown.Although the movie does end in a predictable way, the voyage to that predictable end is more than enough to keep you satisfied. There are some usage of stock characters and several clich\u00e9s throughout, something that maybe will drive some of the audiences away or cloud their judgment. But beside all that, the story is still original and well executed.What seems to be a silly premise evolved into something even more trifling. But with its unbearable charm, it worked astonishingly well."

      "text": "Your Name is a lively combination of romance, identity, and culture. I went into the film with a very little understanding of the plot\u2019s complexities. From the trailer, I assumed Your Name would be an anime Freaky Friday love story. The framework of the narrative certainly fits into my initial assumption. Yet, there is a multitude of undercurrents in the film which make Your Name stand out. For starters, Your Name constantly changes themes and mood. Often, I found myself laughing and, a few minutes later, would suddenly be on the verge of tears. The movie\u2019s eclectic flow makes for a constantly engaging experience. The Freaky Friday element is roughly half of the film\u2019s two-hour runtime. In fact, a plot twist in the film literally took my breath away. Your Name is the rare film which combines overwhelming variety and makes everything fit organically. Through variety, the anime earns a conventional ending between protagonists, Mitsuha and Taki. While body switching is the plot's main intrigue, the film adds complexity through its exploration of Japanese culture. Japanese gender identity is explored with such a masterful hand. In subtle strokes, the viewer understands the sheer contrast in the lives of Japanese men and women. For example, a group of men have a crush on a female co-worker; Mitsuha, in Taki\u2019s body, simply initiates conversation with the desired woman and, with ease, sets up a date. When Taki is back to normal the next day, his male coworkers all line up disgusted by his act of group betrayal. The scene effectively demonstrates the strength of the herd like quality of gender in Japan. It\u2019s no surprise then when Taki, in Mitsuha\u2019s body, finds such humorous wonder in the breasts he suddenly gains. A contrast can also be noticed in the struggle between the past and present. The present is Taki\u2019s experience of Tokyo. Likewise, the past is illustrated by Mitsuha\u2019s familial duty to her small town\u2019s local shrine. In other words, the film merges Japanese spirituality with modern sensibilities. A desire to escape and return to the country define the film\u2019s ecliptic take on Japan. Mitsusha is your typical country girl with a thirst for a life in the city. Meanwhile, Taki finds beauty in Mitsuha\u2019s country town. The viewer amusingly experiences each setting (Tokyo and Itomori) through the unique lens of the protagonists. Ultimately, a comet and local god guide the distant figures into a surprising collision course. As a result, fate is sealed by the two somewhat metaphysically dissimilar sources. The forces of science and divinity augment Your Name into making the seemingly fated connection all the more plausible. The film is a testament of the \u201copposites attract\u201d sentiment. In summary, the film has a real beating heart. I will end my review saying Your Name is the best looking animated film I have ever seen. The colors are always pleasingly vibrant. Additionally, all of the scenes are lovingly rendered and pulsating with life. I haven\u2019t walked out of a theatre with such a positive perspective on life in a long time. If you live in a city, you ought to take the time to experience this anime masterpiece."

      "text": "They're no strangers, yet they've never met.Probably the most anticipated anime since the final film of Mr. Miyazaki. Because people know what these guys are capable of. This is one per cent sci-fi and 99 per cent fantasy. The concept is not new for us. From 'Freaky Friday' to 'The Lake House', even the recent American television film 'The Swap', you will remember a handful of names once you read this film's synopsis. Yet the film was so good, because of how well the theme was utilised.We all know the technical brilliance of '5 Centimeters Per Second' and the beautiful romance from 'The Garden of Words'. This is an excellent mix of those two. If love either of them, or both, then you will love it as well. But if you ask me, my favourite is still 'The Garden of Words' from this director. I liked this film, enjoyed thoroughly, so liking it less than that means not a bad flick. Surely a film to recommend for anime fans, as well as for animation's (western audience).The story of two teenagers, one from the rural Japan mountain region and the other one from Tokyo. The plot revolves around a comet that is to pass by very close to the earth. But before that event, the girl is bored with her life, so she dreams of living in a big city and that too as a boy. One day her wish comes true when she wakes up as she swapped bodies, including most of the memories with a boy from Tokyo.For her, it is to live as she wanted and make use of the opportunity. But for him, it is like a curse, hence becomes rebellious. This thing keeps happening frequently for days and weeks. After some times, realising the phenomena is between two, they make a deal and strict order of Dos and Don'ts while away. All this until the day of comet and everything changes forever. Searching for the truth and the result of it leads to the end of the tale.\u275dTreasure the experience. Dreams fade away after you wake up.\u275eUnlike Miyazaki, Makot Shinkai's storytelling is quite for the matured audience. It targets adults more than the children. Particularly for not shying away to include naturally occurring events in such situation as the story develops, despite/even though the film revolves around the teens/kids. As for this flick, the concern is not big, but it depends on the nation and its culture you belong to. It is very much acceptable and as the story progress, the best things keep replacing another till the finale. So hooked to it is assured.The film length was good and so the pace of the narration. Well written screenplay, which was based on the book of the same name. But the director admits the inspiration from the previous flicks with similar themes. They have used the real places of the anime version with fictional names, but most of the Tokyo remains same and they all were awesome.In many scenes, the camera panning was a treat. Especially the framerate was high, so no jerks, hence very pleasurable visual experience. Like I mentioned earlier, this is a unique film, despite not a original idea. The film proved the Japan is not overshadowed by Hollywood, particularly after the decline of animes in the recent years. It's up to the quality of the product, if so, then those glory days can be brought back for animes. Anyway, now this film holds the record for highest grossed anime.Apart from technical dominance, the story is also enchanting. If you like romance theme, this will serve you well. A good film for date night. But usually people would skip animation for such occasion and one should not mix up that with anime. Because why I always put apart the anime and animation is, the animes are good at beautiful romance, while its counterpart from the west focus more on comedy and adventure. But the common thing from them is the well explored fantasy theme.Usually the ends are guessable for a film like this and the same case for this in here. Only as a result of the story, you would know what's coming, but not the frame by frame scenes of it. Yeah, I liked this conclusion, the final lines said might bring you tears in your eyes, romantically, if you are an emotional person. One of the best endings, even though it was clich\u00e9d. And the credits start to roll up, while you begin to recall everything you just saw in the last 100 minutes. A must see film, so highly recommended by my side. Now I've to wait for another couple of years for such film.8/10"

Le \"nouveau Miyazaki\" sortit de nulle part alors que les animes sont en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral peu m\u00e9diatis\u00e9s et r\u00e9serv\u00e9 \u00e0 un public de niche, devait \u00eatre probablement incroyable pour pr\u00e9tendre \u00e0 sa succession et d\u00e9bouler de la sorte en France. Your Name \u00e9tait magnifique mais pas d\u00e9nu\u00e9 d'erreurs. J'ai donc vu son deuxi\u00e8me meilleur film 5 Centimeters Per Second qui n'est m\u00eame pas r\u00e9f\u00e9renc\u00e9 sur Metacritic (pour le nouveau Miyazaki c'est quand m\u00eame un comble...). Ce film, scind\u00e9 en 3 actes, raconte l'histoire d'un gar\u00e7on, Tataki, pendant trois p\u00e9riodes de sa jeunesse. Au d\u00e9but, il lie une amiti\u00e9 tr\u00e8s forte avec une fille Akari avec qui il entretiendra une relation \u00e9pistolaire tr\u00e8s entretenue. Le d\u00e9veloppement du film raconte alors leur \u00e9loignement progressif pour toutes les raisons de la vie pour finir sur une downer-ending. Pour un anime, je me dois de parler de la forme en premier puis nous aborderons le fond. L'animation est magnifique. Celle de Your Name \u00e9tait bluffante et probablement une des meilleures mais on sent d\u00e9j\u00e0 cette patte dans 5 Centimeters Per Second pourtant sorti en 2007. C'est une animation g\u00e9n\u00e9reuse avec beaucoup de plans larges tr\u00e8s contemplatifs o\u00f9 on peut perdre nos pens\u00e9es dans les campagnes et les paysages urbains japonais. Les dessins ne sont pas particuli\u00e8rement d\u00e9taill\u00e9s ou complexes mais sont foisonnant et riches. Petit point n\u00e9gatif pour les personnages qui \u00e9taient quand m\u00eame parfois \u00e9trangement dessin\u00e9s. Globalement on sent vraiment la volont\u00e9 du r\u00e9alisateur de montrer le Japon dans tous ses \u00e9tats. Ces deux films presque \"carte postale\" montrent le territoire nippon de jour, de nuit, au cr\u00e9puscule, \u00e0 la ville, \u00e0 la campagne, \u00e0 toutes les saisons etc. D'ailleurs les personnages sont relativement peu \u00e0 l'\u00e9cran et cela nous donne la sensation que nous regardons nous m\u00eame ces paysages. Les personnages ne sont en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 pas tr\u00e8s importants dans le film. Une pens\u00e9e pour la musique tout aussi magnifique et compos\u00e9e pour le film. Les dessins et le montage se synchronisent \u00e0 la musique et cela donne au film une sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9 bienveillante qui donne envie de plonger dedans. Your Name continuera dans cette lign\u00e9e. A pr\u00e9sent parlons du fond. Je n'ai pas aim\u00e9 5 Centimeters per Second.Le premier chapitre est \u00e9tonnamment le plus r\u00e9ussi et le plus beau. Les deux suivants ne sont que des prolongements bancales et mal venus qui sont relativement ennuyeux. Je ne comprends vraiment pas comment ce film re\u00e7u de si bonnes critiques (peut-\u00eatre l'animation a bluff\u00e9 tout le monde). Un film normalement constitu\u00e9 cr\u00e9e de la tension et de l'attachement aux personnages et \u00e0 son univers pour que nous nous sentions impliqu\u00e9s dans l'histoire et les p\u00e9rip\u00e9ties. Le d\u00e9nouement sera le moment o\u00f9 le spectateur sera le plus impliqu\u00e9. Ici, paradoxalement, je fus charm\u00e9 pendant la premi\u00e8re partie, la deuxi\u00e8me m'ennuya et la derni\u00e8re \u00e9tait tout simplement mauvaise. J'ai  beaucoup aim\u00e9 l'introduction et je fus particuli\u00e8rement impressionn\u00e9 par la vitesse \u00e0 laquelle le film arrive \u00e0 nous faire comprendre les enjeux et la situation des personnages. Cette relation \u00e9pistolaire complexe se d\u00e9roule parfaitement devant nous si bien qu'au bout de 15 minutes, quand les personnages vont se rencontrer, nous sommes aspir\u00e9s et s\u00e9duis par ce petit couple que l'on \u00e0 l'impression d'avoir vu grandir. Les deux autres parties manquent d'enjeux et d'int\u00e9r\u00eat. Je n'ai toujours pas compris la v\u00e9ritable raison de leur existence. Je comprends que le r\u00e9alisateur voulait nous d\u00e9crire l'\u00e9loignement et comment la vie s\u00e9pare deux humains qui avaient cr\u00e9\u00e9 entre eux quelque chose de magnifique. Mais la mani\u00e8re dont il a essay\u00e9 de nous faire ressentir cela est juste mauvaise et fade. Je suis particuli\u00e8rement sensible aux belles histoires d'amour et d'amiti\u00e9 que ce soit dans les jeux vid\u00e9o ou au cin\u00e9ma et j'ai rarement senti qu'une oeuvre \u00e9tait \"tire-larme\". Mais ici, les deux derni\u00e8res parties (surtout la troisi\u00e8me) \u00e9taient clairement dans ce registre. Je garderai chaudement le souvenir de cette premi\u00e8re partie qui est d\u00e9finitivement une petite capsule po\u00e9tique et douce o\u00f9 le spectateur devient le t\u00e9moin invisible d'un amour impossible entre deux enfants japonais avec la vie et ses obstacles devant eux. Vous ai-je dit qu'il y avait une lune g\u00e9ante dans le film ? Elle ne sert \u00e0 rien.Ma note pour 5 Centimeters Per second : 5/10"

Not only does the film manage to out do western animation by miles, but it also manages to have an amazing story with characters who are easy to release to with both characteristics and emotions. The animation is wonderful, and looks for better than most of the generic looking CGI that Disney and Dreamworks use to death. It also doesn't force political beliefs and any forced usage of \"progressive characters of colour\" that most animated films are pushing these days. It's the simple lives of the characters in this world that are relatable unlike SJW disasters like Moana who push a perfect little princess character that nobody can relate with.Simply put it, the film is great. Quit watching western animated films and watch anime films instead."

It plays with two fantasy layers: the first one is the swap of identities and it seems so incredible the very first minutes of the film, but shortly after it seems normal.. so normal that this normality is broken by the second fantasy layer: the time shift. This movie is touching , because the feeling of love is anxiously valued and so vivid ! I recommend this little little pearl with all my heart"
