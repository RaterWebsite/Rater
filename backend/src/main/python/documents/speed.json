Then it's a rigged bus--if it slows, it will blow, bad enough any day, but a nightmare in LA traffic. And that's still not the end.",

Things go from bad, to worse, to even worse, to \"oh, dear God, why?\" at such an alarming rate and it is nothing short of an absolute blast to watch from start to finish. Jan De Bont's \"Speed\" is up there with \"Die Hard\" and \"Lethal Weapon\" -- that is to say, it's one of the finest, pure action movies ever conceived, produced, and witnessed."

      "text": "An awesome, terrific popcorn thriller and a pure adrenaline rush. Speed is definitely one hell of a ride, and the greatest ride of a lifetime. It's fast paced, mysterious and suspenseful, full of nonstop action and adventure, tense, taut and energetic, leaving you fastening your seat belt tight and hanging on to your seats (literally!) from start to finish. The movie is divided into three sections, the falling express elevator with 13 business executives, then a Santa Monica city bus with 19 passengers and finally, a subway train with only three people, the hero, villain and victim. Director Jan de Bont uses every form of transportation and has Dennis Hopper rig it with explosives, pushing its velocity to its maximum limits. First, you speed up an elevator, then you speed up a city bus over 50 MPH and you have to keep it moving across the downtown city streets and rush hour traffic. The bus literally speeds through LA, swerves, accelerates, jumps and flies! (Like the Magic School Bus) before finally ending up at LAX circling the runway. The bus scene lasts over 50 minutes and becomes the main highlight of the movie, similar to how de Bont substantially expands on Annie's character as she rises in rank from an ordinary bus passenger to Jack's sidekick and love interest. The action, thrill and excitement never stops even when the boobytrapped bus is out of the picture. When the subway train accelerates to full speed and derail on the street, because it goes much faster than a bus. Overall, this is one of the best action film I've seen since the summer of 1994, making it true summer fun. It's the pure definition of an action film."

      "text": "If you're looking for action movie heaven, try Speed, a crackling blend of suspense and fun that gives you the rush of a runaway roller coaster. It's morning-drive time in Los Angeles as a bus packed with passengers heads for the freeway. In a hide-out filled with surveillance gadgetry, mad bomber Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper going full-tilt bug **** as only he can) phones SWAT cop Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) with a perverse pop quiz: \"There's a bomb on the bus. Once the bus goes 50 miles per hour, the bomb is armed. If it drops below 50, the bus blows up. Whaddya do, Jack?\"\r What the bomber wants to do is get Jack to fork over $3.7 million. But Jack is a bit of a loose cannon himself \u2014 his partner, Harry (Jeff Daniels), describes him as \"deeply nuts.\" What Jack wants to do is hop on the bus, disarm the bomb, then find this psycho and whup his extortionist ass. Guess who gets his wish? Hollywood cynics have tagged Speed as Die Hard on a bus. Fair enough. Originality isn't the film's strong suit; execution is. Under Siege was prematurely dissed as Die Hard on a submarine until Andrew Davis showed what a gifted director could do with a formula plot.\r First-time director Jan De Bont performs similar marvels with Speed. De Bont, the acclaimed cinematographer who took his camera under the ocean in The Hunt for Red October and up Sharon Stone's skirt in Basic Instinct, also shot the original Die Hard. He's learned firsthand how to grab an audience. And though the script by newcomer Graham Yost lacks the solid character base of last summer's Fugitive and In the Line of Fire, the acting is as kinetic as the action.\r Reeves is a major surprise; he cuts a sturdy figure far removed from the malebimbo act that made him a star in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure and proved ruinous to his so-called serious performances in Dracula and Much Ado About Nothing. Reeves' hard of body/soft of head image gets tweaked in Speed when the bomber tells Jack: \"Don't attempt to grow a brain.\" But Reeves has the last laugh by delivering a vigorous, no-bull performance that suggests we'll be able to hear his name in the future without silently mouthing the word dude.\r While Reeves and Hopper play a battle of wits, Sandra Bullock nearly drives off with the picture. As Annie, a passenger whom Jack puts behind the wheel when the bus driver is shot, the smart and sassy Bullock is a knockout. She makes us believe the impossible things Annie is doing and, better, makes us care. Bullock's roles in Demolition Man, Wrestling Ernest Hemingway and The Thing Called Love would have made her a star already if the films were less dreary. Speed is a spiffier vehicle, and it's a pleasure to watch her ride this baby home. Jack picks Annie to drive because she's had her license revoked for speeding. She's more exhilarated than scared keeping the bus hurtling along even when it means flooring the gas pedal to clear a 50-foot gap in the freeway or taking a detour into city traffic that becomes a nerve-rattling demolition derby.\r The stunts, including Jack's leaping onto the bus from a moving car and his trying to dismantle the bomb while dangling near wheels that could squish him into road kill, will have you ducking in your seat. If the bus doesn't get you, there's the elevator crash that opens the film and the subway chase that closes it.\r Still, the fireworks wouldn't count for much if the hardware overwhelmed the humanity. Speed cinches its spot as the thrill ride of summer by providing characters to hiss at and root for. Jack and Annie actually manage to strike up a convincing romance even at hyperspeed and without taking their eyes off the road. It's an impressive feat enhanced by the film's knack \u2014 shared with The Fugitive \u2014 for serving up two hours of pure pow without gratuitous gore. Action flicks are usually written off as a debased genre, unless, of course, they work. And Speed works like a charm. It's a reminder of how much movie escapism can still stir us when it's dished out with this kind of dazzle. Pass the popcorn."

      "text": "Director Jan de Bont\u2019s action-movie \u201cSpeed\u201d is nothing besides an outstanding film that tells the story of characters trapped in a bus being driven by Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) while a cop called Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves), is tryng to disarm a bomb in the vehicle. One of the greatest points of the movie are it\u2019s characters, wich, even tought being both extremely charismatic and skilled, on the end of the day are just common people trying to outcome an uncommon situation. The characters decisions and attitudes are generally understandable and believable, even tought their respective arcs somehow manage to be gripping, on their own ways. Bont also delivers a truly impressive artwork with the action scenes, leaving the spectator on the edge of his seat the whole movie and provoking a lot of anxiety.The big selling point of the movie, although, isn\u2019t the villain, Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper), wich shows a giantic lack of charisma. The movie\u2019s antagonist simply can\u2019t convince anyone with his motivations either, he is an ex-officer that is revolted by the fact that, even dedicating years to the Police Department, didn\u2019t get rich.There isn\u2019t any word that can describe this incredible masterpiece better than \u201cbreathtaking\u201d. The story, the casting selection, and the feelings that the spectators will experience during the filme, are just mesmerizing."

The film was more exciting and had more surprises than I expected it would, so I'm giving it a high recommendation for anyone looking for a well oiled thrill ride.  There is one problem however that I couldn't ignore.  Keanu Reeves gives a wooden and extremely unconvincing performance.  I'd expect that from him, but he's still shockingly un-nuanced in his role here.  He was way better in the Matrix.  Other than that, Speed is a fast paced and extremely fun movie."

It has plenty of action but Speed is basically about a terrorist (Dennis Hopper) who after blowing a lift and the innocents escape due to help from the police and LAPD then makes the cops believe he is dead after he detonates a bomb strapped to him. Later on he rigs a city bus and Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) has to board the bus and keep it's speed above 50 because if the bus speed drops below 50mph it explodes thereby killing everyone on board.. Jeff Daniels and Joe Morton also star along with Sandra Bullock...I wouldn't say Speed is the best film ever made but it's up there and it's a worthy competitor and it wouldn't have worked if Keanu Reeves and Dennis Hopper didn't get involved.

      "text": "One of the best thrillers of its time. It is an intense cat and mouse game with an excellent cast that is entertaining from start to finish. Sadly the sequel killed the franchise and there is not much talking about the movie anymore. The movie is about a confrontation between SWAT officers and an extortionist bomber. The bomber is a clever schemer that seems always one or two steps ahead. This creates an intense experience that grabbed me from the beginning. There is always a Damocles sword above the heads of the protagonist. Sadly I cant go into details to avoid spoilers. Lets say the story, twists and characters are excellent. The main actors with Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock, Jeff Daniels and Dennis Hopper fully deliver their roles. They have a great chemistry and work well. I cant imagine anyone better suited for this movie. I have also to praise the team behind the camera, director and writer. Those are the other half of a really good movie (One does not work well without the other). Other than that the stunts, explosions and drive scenes are fully conniving and add to the intense atmosphere. I think I already summed up everything necessary. Overall this movie was a great success making approx 10 times its production cost and was talked a lot back then. I would recommend this movie if you like an adrenaline ride. Sadly it never became a cult movie as it is a bit forgotten but also when you mention it well remembered."
