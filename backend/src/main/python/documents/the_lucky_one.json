Weak screenplay that would have been better had they allowed Zak Efron's character to actually save the ex husband from drowning.  Zac and Taylor are pretty too watch but neither one of them come off as being mature strong actors.  They rather appear like daytime soap opera performers.  Blythe Danner is the only one in the film who is actually convincing."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "It is unbelievable just how awful this film really is. I'm happy to see Zac Efron further his career from the crap High school musical films, but in this film, he didn't fit the role AT ALL. Zac Efron and the word marine don't even sound right in the same sentence. The acting was dreadful, the story was cheesy (i know its Nicholas Sparks so i expected it) but this movie was just terrible. It was my girlfriends idea to see it (go figure) but even she was laughing through the entire film like myself. By the way Taylor Schilling has to be the worst actress i've ever scene on the big screen. She couldn't even fake cry, and when she started laughing while crying, she sounded like a retarded baby. This movie was just awful. Not enjoyable what so ever. The best acting in the film came from the little boy for christs sake. For once in a blue moon the critics actually got one right. This movie is the definition of terrible. Don't see it, its a waste of money, time, and precious brain cells. 0/10"}, {"rating": "4", "text": "I've got to admit, the setup works, but the climax is pure deus ex machina.  The Lucky One begins with circumstances falling upon Logan, and ends with circumstances exonerating him from the need to do anything about his rival, Keith.  This is weak storytelling.  At least the cinematography has everything there should be in a date movie; sunrise and sunset shots, carefully placed lens flare in moments of passionate kissing, etc.  It's a pretty movie, I'll give it that,  but the casting in The Lucky One doesn't work.  Efron is all wrong for the role, in any realistic sense.  He's got to be the scrawniest, most sensitive marine I've ever seen, and Schilling is lacking in the having \"it\" category.  For a tale of love and lust, The Lucky One comes up half short.  Full review on my blog."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "This movie is almost identical to the notebook and other movies. This movie had its moments but most of the love moments have been seen in alot of other movies. The Lucky One is just another repetitive movie"}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Good performances and generally strong emotional moments are sadly let down enough by the over the top predictable melodrama. I give this movie 56% of a good movie."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "There is one thing people need to understand. Most movies copy eachother. It's a good change to see zac efron in a more grown up film. They did alot of the war sences well and putting the photo of the girl in at the right time. The one thing i liked most about this film that it really showed how much they really tried making this film a hit. This film had it's flause the scripting and the house break in and the conversation in the kitchen needed to be workt on Seemed to rusht. But overall I give it an 8 (very good in my ratings)"}, {"rating": "4", "text": "First of all, I'm not a Nicholas Sparks fan. I like his the plots of his novels but when it comes to the movie, it is quite disappointing. I watched some of the movies which are based on the novels of Nicholas Sparks. One of these is The Lucky One. The actors were great actually but I think there is something wrong with the movie itself. It lacks of impact to the viewers. It did not make me feel I want to be in love. It is quite disappointing."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Sorry to all the people, but I think that the movie is guy (yes I'm like this type of movies), I think that is good watching Zac Efron in other movies (after HSM), but the problem is his performance, is not the better, have some moments but need be better, the rest of the cast have regular performances. Now the story, is good, romantic, and all this things, but the problem is the development, have some problems in the story of the movie. The Lucky One is for the girls that like of this genre of movies (I included), but the rest of the people can watch other thing."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Efron Show's He Is A Real Actor!

Rarely does a director improve on a book (Horse Whisperer and Robert Redford is an example) and so I think that the director failed when he didn't stick with the book.  Nicholas Sparks has great ideas, and sometimes not so great endings, but the beginning and middle of the book were better than this movie.  I am not a tween nor a 20 or 30 something, but have had to take course work for art in pursuit of a BA and MA.  I love sometimes stupid movies just for the laughs, but this movie was a total disappointment.  I gave it two stars for the effort of the performers.  The director shoulders the rest of my disgust with his freedom of interpretation."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Contrary to many critics' opinion, for me, The Lucky One depicts a carefully diligent and lovely portrayal of a modern, heartfelt fairytale romance grounded in real and relatable experiences and emotion to which the viewer can easily form intimate connections with. Combat war backgrounds and small town single parenthood, both with their own underlying complexities, may be cliche, but it doesnt make them any less meaningful or somehow ingenuine. Cliches become cliched precisely because at their origin they are valid enough to warrant vast reiteration until the idea is so beautifully simple that it can reach anyone at their core. Moreover, I found that the meaning behind the story of the miracle photo has much more depth than others give it credit for. Expectations, cheesy lines, and judgements aside, a beautifully romantic, raw and unshrinking love story unravels that is undeniably passionate and signular. The unrelenting chemistry the two share is unhindered and magnetically attractive to a fault, ultimately portraying a fundamental connection that is seductively mesmerizing in every scene. Couple that with the idyllic quaint yet breathtaking small town Louisiana country setting and you'll have the ultimate dream home and love story to forever fantasize about."}], "recommendations": ["the_vow", "the_last_song", "seven_pounds", "the_fault_in_our_stars", "the_lake_house", "a_walk_to_remember", "passengers", "forever_my_girl", "the_illusionist", "if_i_stay", "the_notebook", "alice_through_the_looking_glass", "the_twilight_saga_breaking_dawn_part_1", "stardust", "maleficent", "aquamarine", "the_blind_side", "the_best_of_me", "fantastic_beasts_the_secrets_of_dumbledore", "meet_joe_black", "ben_hur", "tomorrowland", "black_panther_wakanda_forever", "gone_girl", "hustlers"]}
