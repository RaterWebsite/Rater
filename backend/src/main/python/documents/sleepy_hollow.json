In the movie adaptation, New York detective Ichabod Crane must travel to the mysterious Sleepy Hollow in order to solve a series of murders that took place there, but realizes the town's dark history and the legend of a headless horseman might be the true culprit. Sleepy Hollow is essentially a highly stylized slasher flicks. There are lots of gory decapitations set against a fittingly gothic tone, and although it's never truly heart-poundingly intense, there is a great atmosphere and some creepy imagery. Burton does make this movie a bit darker than his previous films (at the time), but there's still a bit of humor in its heart, mostly because of Johnny Depp's role as the Ichabod. Even though it deviates significantly from its source material, Sleepy Hollow is a fun, atmospheric movie."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Sleepy Hollow. Head off the shoulders! A very beautiful movie with an interesting story and excellent acting. Of course, Johnny Depp and his Ichabod deserve special praise.

This time, Ichabod Crane is a police investigator sent to the village of Sleepy Hollow (founded by Dutch immigrants) to discover a killer who cuts and collects heads. Obviously the star of this tale could only be Johnny Depp, a bizarre movie buff and an old Burton collaborator, as well as one of the most versatile and talented actors of the day. The film also features Christina Ricci (a Wednesday from \"Addams Family\"), Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon and Casper Van Dien. Christopher Lee, who was the master of terror in the seventies thanks to his extraordinary voice and diction, also makes a brief but excellent appearance.The cast is extraordinarily good and does a great job. No fish bones, as we say in Portugal. It does not deserve a single negative note: the good quality of the actors and the precise direction of Burton was a combination with impeccable results. Depp is effective, can even be funny when he can; Ricci is seductive, engaging and mysterious. Miranda Richardson does a good job but the script requires that only in the end we be able to see the true value of this actress. The scenarios and ambiance, deeply Gothic, gloomy and hazy, is mysterious and scary, preparing the audience for eventual scares and giving the film the atmosphere of a horror movie when, in fact, we are in a suspense thriller. The CGI is used with caution and prudence, getting good visual effects and sound without boring or saturating the audience, as it is supposed.Not corresponding to the original story, it is however a very good film, appeals easily to the majority of the audience and is very well done. Certain scenes can cause big scares, but overall it's not a movie I would call scary."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Good film. A good combination of horror, humor and creepiness. Definately worth watching if you like Tim Burton's movies."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow was designated a failure upon release both critically and commercially. This isn't a bad film and upon hindsight the aesthetics and pacing are good, but it isn't scary or even disturbing, which might have been the director's intention. The gothic atmosphere seeping through the fantastic production design is something to savor however, and one of the great assets of the film is the production design. Based on Washington Irving's tale \"The legend of Sleepy Hollow\" Johnny Depp stars as the well-meaning but cowardice Ichabod Crane who comes to this town to investigate the murders which are all similar in nature- gruesomely beheaded. I cannot pinpoint why the film failed but one thing is certain- Its reputation- as with many rediscovered films is improving with each passing day. If you are in a mood for a moody, atmospheric film then Sleepy Hollow will fill that void perfectly.(Atmospheric and gothic- a nice excursion to Sleepy Hollow)."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "It's extremely campy and it knows it. It's more concerned with being a fun homage to classic Hammer horror films than an adaptation of \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\".Its silliness can be a bit off-putting at first, but after a while, it grew on me.

Johnny as always was brilliant. I don't know the book story, probably that's why the adaptation didn't sang to me. I expected more detective work and a successful one. I hoped he could have saved more lives, but that's the story. It moved slow, a bit, enough to make me lose my curiosity and interest. Nevertheless, it was good to see Johnny and Tim working again, more please!

Where some things falter, the main consistencies here would have to be the costume design, production design, and the cinematography. All add together to make this a visually striking and beautiful film. I may not have loved the film, but I really wanted to, if only for those elements being so strong. In addition, this one is very good at mood setting, as it feels dark, disturbing, and creepy throughout. However, this mood does get upset by one of the main negatives of this film; the acting. The acting from everyone is poor at best. I expected a lot better from Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci, but their performances felt entirely wooden and emotionless, even worse when they did put in emotion, it felt entirely over the top. The added in demonic elements were also entirely off-putting and came off as forced. Finally, the special effects lacked at times. A lot of the time, the special effects were extremely cool and well done (everything with the tree), but a lot of the time, they fell flat and just looked overly stylized and fake. As a whole, Sleepy Hollow rides on its visual splendor, but is nothing more than eye candy unfortunately."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "This is just garbage, it's too deviant from short story, this kind of horror works for Dracula and Frankenstein, but Sleepy Hollow, not so much."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Sleepy Hollow is often praised for its great visuals. It invokes a dark mood and gives a nod towards the way lighting was used in movies as the Third Man. Alas, the visuals take a backseat on the small screen of my laptop and brings in focus the story and characters. And the contrast is striking. The movie is filled with strong actors like John Gambon, Martin Landau and Jeffrey Jones. But there is hardly any acting by them as they are figures in landscapes, witnesses to Depp's antics and victims for the headless horseman.Depp plays a young constable of a New York police force that did not exist for another fifty years and denounces police torture methods that were never tolerated(at least not until recently). He gets send to investigate strange beheadings in a remote village populated by yokels. He is the agent of modernity who is going to bring the light of reason to the outback. Or so you think.But actually; no. Sleepy Hollow is like a slideshow: we move from one set to the other. Each scene is like a painting: well crafted with powerful lighting. Deliberate marvelous pieces. A girl dressed in all white on a white horse in a landscape of black leafless trees. A massive tree dominating the travellers, its branches clawing the dreary sky. A small town smothered by fog. An Inn full with bright colors, people, laughter and music.But how do we get from one scene to the next? We use Depp. He meanders through the story: stumbles into caves, plunges into forests and trips over bodies. There is no investigation as such. He is just led on. When he gets stuck a witch tells him where to go next or a sidekick finds something and says: you have to see this, sir. And then he leads him to the scary tree and the girl in white tells you its name. It isn't a bad movie because even on my laptop it looks interesting, but it is evident that the story and characters are just there for the visuals. Pity, considering all the acting talent available."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This movie is creepy, stunning and legendary at my household.This is my #CupOfTea."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "As I like Tim Burton, and I am fond of the timeless story, I was eager to see what this 1999 film was like. I also grew up on the Disney classic The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, the Headless Horseman creeped me out so badly when I was little I thought I would never see the day when I would see that topped. Now after seeing this I think I just have. The Headless Horseman is terrifying here, Christopher Walken does a phenomenal job playing him. I do agree that the story does drag on occasions, but plenty makes up for that minor fault. Visually, Sleepy Hollow is amazing, like Batman Returns and Edward Scissorhands, the sets and cinematography are dark and Gothic, and the special effects are wonderful. Also Tim Burton I think was the perfect choice for director, he is oddball and eccentric and that directorial style is perfect for this film allowing him to give a clever, unique and atmospheric take on the story. The music score by none other than maestro Danny Elfman is dark, suspenseful and haunting, like it should be. The story is a true timeless tale of horror, and really well structured here, as is the nuanced script. The performances are excellent once again, with Johnny Depp absolutely brilliant as the maverick yet intuitive Ichabod Crane and Christina Ricci fine in a poignant sort of way as the lovely Katerina. Solidly supporting them all the way are Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson, Michael Gough, Jeffrey Jones, Ian McDiarmid and Richard Griffiths. And of course the film is full of cruel shocks and thrills, the murder scenes are shocking and violent but not in the sense that you have to look away. Overall, very unique and beautiful take on the tale. 9/10 Bethany Cox"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Witt screenplay of Washington Irving story that excels the naive animated version of Walt Disney.

If not for Tim Burton, the feature wouldn't have made it post its first act, for each and every frame screams his manner throughout its runtime. Johnny Depp is convincing in it but isn't as good as expected or required and neither is supported well enough by the supporting cast like Christina Ricci and Miranda Richardson.
