The pros: Each character had their own cool or unique moments. I was really pleased for the most part with the amount of time each of the characters had in the spotlight! The action in this also rarely let up! Once the movie started, it really got going and didn't slow down a whole lot until the very end!  Furthermore, I felt or went through just about every emotion under the sun while watching this! Joy, excitement, sadness, anger, anxiety, you name it, I felt it! To top that all off, my heart just about wanted to shatter during certain moments! I can't even begin to express how often I found myself yelling at the screen overall! I'll also say that the personal icing on the cake for me was the post-credit scene, as it alluded to an upcoming MCU film that I've been beyond excited for! The cons: Certain character deaths were rushed and unearned in my opinion. And also, some heroes that come to mind that I felt didn't receive quite enough screentime were Hulk, Black Panther, Bucky Barnes, and sadly Steve Rogers too. Other than that, I'd say that most everyone else got their fair share of screentime. And lastly, OF COURSE it had to end on a cliffhanger for Avengers 4 next year, so that was obviously highly frustrating, especially since it left us hanging on a not-so-pretty note, but that's all I'll say! Overall, this was one wild film and quite a lot to take in all at once to be honest! However, I still loved and was actively and emotionally invested in so much of it that I can say with certainty that this was a step above the slightly weaker Age of Ultron, but the lightheartedness and sheer fun of the very first Avengers remains my favorite still, but like I said, you certainly can't go wrong with this one either!"

Well I can't say much about the film, but as far as I know, it brings all of its characters from previous Marvel Cinematic Universe films and unite them together to face their biggest threat out of all the villains from the previous films.

      "text": "Infinity War is the pinnacle of what blockbuster films should be. Directed by the Russo brothers, they manage to achieve the almost impossible feat of culminating all the characters and their stories into one epic film. The action, the characters, the story and the overall experience is spectacular to behold. Each characters has their own moment to shine, as we see new fun and somewhat emotional interactions between characters and story arcs that pay off as the film progresses . The result is a film that often feels surprisingly earnest and emotional. It pays off our emotional investment into these great characters over each of the 18 previous films through a great culmination of storytelling. The humor we have come to expect in Marvel films is lively and full of banter, particularly between Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and the quick-fire interplay between Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and the Guardians of the Galaxy. Unlike Marvel's cascade of villains who are turned secondary to their superhero counterparts, Thanos (Josh Brolin) is the central character in this epic, with a moral compass that is beyond what many might expect. Whilst he may seem to be the most demonic villain that the Avengers have come across, he is by far and away the most complex of them all, testament to the directing and writing of the film. There's a lot going on in this movie, with many scenes occurring almost simultaneously, leaving the ending on a much vague yet appropriate cliffhanger. Overall, Infinity War epitomizes the perfect blockbuster film that ends in poetic grace and is sure to leave you questioning what will happen next."

It is not a film that can stood by itself,   It is a culmination of 10 years worth of 'hard work', interconnected story lines, multiple characters that define the MCU.  It is also a film that shows us that Marvel is so way above the curve in comparison to other studios that tries to establish an inter connected universe.  It also ends in a gut wrenching third act that segue in the 4th, yet untitled Avengers film.  Believe me, things will go bad, with many comparing this to the level of Empire Strikes Back.  Acting wise: Josh Brolin is an absolute stand out as Thanos, the main villain. He is the best villain the whole MCU.  The rest of the casts are no slouch either, balancing humor and tragedy in equal measure. The action sequences are also astonishing, with a higher stake: our heroes can and will die in this installment.  An absolute classic that ranks as the best MCU flick by far."

      "text": "The principal reason that this movie worked out so well is because you literally care about every single one of them, you care about them and feel for them. The fact that we already know all the characters very well is just so awesome, like you feel that they are your friends and you are part of them and they a part of you.The story of the movie is very simple, is basically Thanos, the big titan, going after all the 6 infinity stones for him to be able to balance the universe, so our heroes unite to do their best to stop him.For a super-hero to be that good, it is extremely important for the villain to be good, for him no to be generic, and with happiness i say that he is perfect in every aspect. I'm gonna start with the most important, he is not that generic villain that want to destroy the universe just for this very reason, he does have a motivation, a rational reason that does make a lot of sense, you probably don't agree but surely buy the idea, because makes sense and it is in our day to day life. His personality is on point, the character can pass his ideas clearely, he does have charisma and among the villains some unique characteristics, he can express emotions better than a bunch of main characters in other movies. He is scary, you can see how powerful he is and how he is getting stronger during the movie, in some moments that you can just hear his steps, you squirms out of tension, in some moments you can see in his face that he is angry and is so notable how different things get whe he is like that, just at the beginning it does show how mighty he is.They gave him a background, wich helped to make us care about him to.The expressions that Josh Brolin had was so much on point. His Cgi is insanely great, it is so good that doesn't even seem that it is a cgi character, you completely forgets that it is fake. He did had a nice arc.The Black Order characters are all well designed and all had their moments, but only fauce de ebano were well developed, he did had his speech, kid of had a background and all of his moments were dope.The film splits into nuclei, all the heroes start isolated from eachother and posteriorly some end up finding others, and the 2h30min of movie help to it to happen in the most natural way as possible. The presentation of each core is done with mastery, inserting the audience into the language of the original film, whether through colors, as in the case of Asgard, or music, with the Guardians of the Galaxy and Wakanda. The movie does have a nice balance between comedy and drama, even that are some jokes that felt out of place, in the most they did worked and didn't disturb the tone of the movie, it still serious and with consequences. The movie has gigantic scales, it is not like any other movie that you did watched for sure, it is different thant any other, and this is another important factor that makes it so great. One of the best actions that i have ever seen, the movie is so happy in doing the heroes work together and use their powers together, it did make some iconic moments and very memorable scenes. And are moments that are like Lord of the Rings, a giant and stunning war, that i can't talk a lot about it to not spoil.It definely shocked me much more than i expected, there are so many surprises, it is like a napalm, there is so much happening and is so fast and so burner at the same time. Some action scenes just made my hole movie session scream like crazy. The interaction between the characters and the personality shock was done with maestry, they gave time for them to meet up and not feel weird that they are cooperating, all felt organic.If there is some bad things about the movie ? Yes, in some specific moments the cgi doesn't worked and is possibly that it took you off the movie a bit. Some things about the story doesn't make a lot of sense to me, but isn't that crucial and will not ruin the movie to anyone.You do feel the break from one nucleus to the other, i believe that could have had some better transitions, but i get that it is very complicated. There is one specific relationship that i believe that could have been more explored for us to feel kind of how Thanos was feeling in that moment.It did creates nostalgia with interactions of old characters and excitement with the new cross-overs.One thing that this movie can do to us, is let us apprehensives, considering how big of a treat that Thanos is you fear for the life of literally every single one, this kind of thing doesn't happens in almost none super hero movie. It is surely the most shocking Marvel movie.The movie is very creative whe it is about on the using of the power of the stones. It did had moments that happened things that you could never see it coming.Avengers Infinity War, does not have a great story, but is fun and show that not every super hero movie needs to be the same."

So you should watch all of those before you start watching Infinity War. Because this movie doesn't give you time to breath and catch up. Loads of characters, settings, items, references of which the movie assumes that you are familiar with them. It's a rollercoaster that doesn't let up.  After preparing for ages, Thanos is making his last moves. He is coming. Dread it, run from it, destiny still arrives. Dread. That word actually describes this movie really well. From the very first scene you already know that the stakes are enormous, the threat is immediate and all encompassing, and stopping Thanos truly feels like the greatest challenge in the universe. There are still jokes, heartfelt moments, marvelous special effects and hilarious jokes. Like you would expect from any MCU movie. And amazing special effects, scenery, tech ...There are loads of characters and none of them get a lot of screen time, yet there's still character development (naturally not for all of them, not even for all heroes).This is also a movie about decisions and choices. My only gripe with the movie is that some of those decisions and their consequences break my suspension of disbelief. The fate of the universe is at stake people, come on ... are you really going to do that?! After two days, I'm still processing the movie and may 3 2019 can't be there fast enough to conclude phase three of the MCU.It's a different kind of superhero movie and it's amazing. Go watch it."

      "text": "Ever since Iron Man made its way into theaters in 2008,that was the beginning of the ambitious Marvel Cinematic Universe,that,from there on out,went on like a New Super Mario Bros game. You complete some levels (the solo movies) all the way up to the final level (the Avengers movie) of each world (Phase).This definitely seems like the last level (almost) of World 3. After 10 Years of waiting we\u2019re finally here,and the hype is so intense that if you say something negative,it almost seems like a crime. That\u2019s why I\u2019ll talk about the negatives first instead of the goods,given that nothing is as perfect as,say,24 Carat Gold. Aside from some unbalanced CG and the score (which needs its own paragraph),I want to take a moment and despise the marketing team. The movie was marketed as \u2018\u2019The Biggest Event Of All-Time\u2019\u2019 (a thing most movies are doing nowadays),although the commercials were amping it up to an Interstellar-like seriousness. And while it\u2019s a damn good movie,I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s as good as Interstellar or Once Upon a Time In America,given that selling it like that makes the movie look like a legendary event (which,in part,is supposed to be). Let\u2019s hope the team won\u2019t do the same thing with Avengers 4 and learn from the mistakes.Also,darn it,was the score by Alan Silvestri (Ready Player One and The Avengers) disappointing! Coming out of RPO,I was amping my expectations up for this score,but all I got was another generic Marvel score whose little cues and overall theme will be remembered for sure other than the whole tracklist.Now that the problems are out of the way,there\u2019s a LOT to talk about the positives.I admire what writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (Civil War and The Winter Soldier) did with the story,resulting in a Dunkirk-like structure,where it\u2019s divided in 3 separate stories that,by the end of the movie,get connected together perfectly (like a complicated Puzzle). It DOES feel like if it\u2019s Part 1 of a much-bigger event (the arrival of Avengers 4 in about a year),especially given that we have 79 characters in the ring.Tone shifts every now and then,and it\u2019s a good thing,since each member,with its own screen-time,surprisingly,give you a moment to laugh or cry (Yes,the quips and jokes are there,but none of them detract you from the central story). For example,when we have Iron Man with Banner,Strange and Wong,it gets serious,but when we have the Guardians,it gets funny all-the-way. This is the most \u2018Shakespearean\u2019 (I guess) Marvel movie since the first Thor,so be on the look for that. The part I was mostly curious to hear about was how the crowd was going to react to the end,but I won\u2019t say what happened because spoilers.Thanos (played by Deadpool 2 star Josh Brolin) is probably the best written Marvel villain of all-time. I loved his motivation,his charisma,his design,and rife with lines like \u2018\u2019I could just snap my fingers and you\u2019d all cease to exist\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2019Perfectly balanced as all things should be\u2019\u2019,you know right away he\u2019s perfectly written. However,as much as I would go full fanboy for him,I wouldn\u2019t say he is as great of a villain as,say,Killmonger. It\u2019s certainly better than Loki,but where Killmonger came with a more realistic approach,I feel like Thanos didn\u2019t have all the cards on the table to be a great villain,for me only. Everyone will mostly rave about him nonetheless,(even if they should). Oh,and the motion capture is amazing,so\u2026Every actor/actress was amazing all the way,from Downey Jr to Evans to Pratt to Saldana to\u2026.Basically everyone.As I said,yeah,some of the effects are unbalanced,but that doesn\u2019t mean the CG is bad. All of the effects are off the chain,especially,as I said,the motion capture on Thanos.Look,if you see Infinity War as a fan,you\u2019ll definitely enjoy it,but as a marketing choice,you\u2019ll probably see it as a disaster on every level. But (there\u2019s always a but) my heart was pounding all the way through the end,I laughed and I didn\u2019t cry for those moments (bit of a serious person),so\u2026 I\u2019m surprised to say it,but I\u2019m curious to see what will happen in Avengers 4. Now the annoying part is that I\u2019m going to hear everyone scream in pain for that movie while I get comfy for Incredibles 2. Bring it on,I guess\u2026"

But, as much as the humor isn\u2019t lost, even though some will want it to be brought down a bit, lucky for them, darkness isn\u2019t abandoned. Because when Thanos shows up, consequences there are. Trust me when I say no one is prepared for what they see. \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d is indeed worth the hype. One of the best Marvel movies ever. And, Thanos is the best Marvel movie villain ever. Josh Brolin NAILED him. And, that\u2019s why this movie succeeded. Well done, Disney, Marvel Studios and Kevin Feige. You did it.I give \u201cInfinity War\u201d a 5-Star rating.\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fAlso, there is one surprise in this movie the anti-Disney trolls failed to spoil. And, that\u2019s why I say to them when they try to spoil the movie: #NotTodayZurg."

Truth is, I really feel bad for the quintet of The Russo Bros, the screenwriters (Markus & Mcfeely), and Feige. They literally have the universe on their shoulders. Infinity War is unavoidably overstuffed, but one thing is for sure: Thanos is the main character in here. They didn't mess around with their \"the movie centers on Thanos\" advertising. This is the first MCU movie to have REAL (and I mean, REAL!) stakes, and felt almost real too (Loki's threat in The Avengers obviously had the usual \"aliens come to New York to invade Earth\" feels). The Russos (And the Screenwriters and Kevin Feige) really did the impossible, juggling no less than 30 characters (For comparison, \"CA: Civil War\" had roughly 15-20 characters at max).Final word: Thanos is the OG of the universe!!"

IMO Thanos might be on par with Heath Ledger's Joker to become one of the finest villains ever put to the screen.It has at least 15 epic moments.The ENDING was WOW,probably in top 5 Endings in Superhero Films.That being said,it is flawed masterpiece,the pacing of the third act has some problems,and the weight of too many characters in one movie is very noticeable,but these are the type of flaws that are so inconsequential due to this thrilling beast.Still.this film is intense,emotionally resonant,fast paced,visually dazzling and techically a MASTERPIECE"

Would you ever read a book about random superheroes fighting from the beginning to the end with literally not storytelling? CGI and boombastic scenes does not make a movie more interesting to anyone who has ever watched a few movies before.In a story drown 6 foots under by a bajillion plot holes, it's hard to take the movie seriously. Not to mention, for anyone who has ever read/watched at least a single piece of fiction, it's obvious all the heroes who died at the end of the movie are going to come back rendering the weight of anything that happens meaningless. Why can't movies do anything better than create a stupid villain with little to no background as a plot-device for its movie. What happens when no villains are around? Is there a constant influx of supervillains wishing for world destruction coming out of a portal every single day in these dumb universes?If a game attempted a similar storyline, it would get bashed seriously and receive a trash score. However, just because the name Marvel is stamped on the product, it instantly becomes a 10/10 by any fanboy regardless of the content.Spoiler alert: Avengers 100th movie is still going to be against a villain that makes no sense just for the sake of having a plot device to insert an infinite amount of CGI crap. Here's an idea for you, make them throw universes at themselves for more explosions next time around. Please bring more cliche stories, we don't have enough of these already."

      "text": "Infinity war is a movie with some good action, but incredibly poorly written and predictable plot. The whole movie feels like a huge shock factor stunt that aims to have emotional impact that weights down on the viewer but ultimately falls flat. The only emotion I felt leaving the cinema was regret for spending my money and anger at the creators of Infinity War, because frankly, there was a time I used to enjoy the MCU and felt like this movie that wanted to represent the climax of all the previous 18 movies ended up being a huge let down.A small advice. Next time when you will again try to create a dark movie with emotional impact, Marvel, try to be a little bit less obvious with your intentions and don't spoil the movie yourself by announcing sequels for all the supposedly killed off heroes before their \"sad deaths\". Be so kind and leave at least a small benefit of the doubt for the viewers. How can we feel sorry for a character's death when we already know said character, no matter how tearful threir dying scene is, will be brought back in the next movie? Do you think so little of your own fanbase? We all know the reason to why only the newer characters (with confirmed sequels) disappeared and the original stayed. We understand all the characters who died after the snap and Gamora who was sacrificed to get the Soul Stone will be coming back. And that it will be by the original Avengers doing in the Avengers 4. We understand it is the original surviving Avengers who are in true danger of dying for real in the MCU in the coming Avengers 4.That makes the characters whose deaths were not inflicted by the Soul Stone or Infinity Gauntlet possibly the only permanent deaths of Infinity War. At least Marvel gave us the benefit of the doubt there. You would think that it's these deaths Marvel takes extra care to make them be felt hard? Well, then you are sadly mistaken. The possible permanent deaths on the list include Heimdall, Loki & Vision (Vision is AI, he can be saved in some way by Tony or Shuri), so characters who were killed off quickly without an afterthought in an opening scene!!! And in this light it brings the IW movie even lower.Always when character gets killed for a shock factor, with the only purpose to show how powerful the newest villain is (I see you Warriors Three), I cringe. As I have already stated, shock factor deaths are just a result of awful screenwriting. Hey Marvel, if you want to create a truly awesome, fear inducing villain, there are better ways to do it. Have you forgot everything about character building? The irony Marvel decided to kill off in this manner its arguably most complex & popular villainous character makes it even worse. Loki was  introduced to us as a powerful magician who could trick even Odin, shapeshifter, user of telepathy, telekinesis, with inborn elementary ice magic, high intellect, manipulative deceiving skills who used to wield not one, but two infinity stones. Loki had Space Stone in his possession, he knew Thanos is coming for years and had time to prepare himself. Yet Loki is not shown fighting or using any of his skills.If someone told me before the IW that Marvel will make Loki go against Thanos with nothing but dagger out of all his skills, I would have laughed. Sorry but to give the very character that once threatened the whole planet of Earth and was the very reason project Avengers was created such a poor last stand was an awfully scripted mistake. Especially when he is the only big character truly dying in IW. The \"no resurrection\" remark as they felt the need to assure viewers that this time the trickster god is really gone was truly pathetic. And there is more than enough eye-roll inducing moments like this in IW movie.Gamora scene. That is HOW to make characters go with honour. Strong scene, with background story and fight. But again, I think she is coming back because her death is connected to the Soul Stone. If not, then this was the highlight of the movie. I sincerely doubt it tho.The only apspect I have praise for in this movie is the amazing acting. Marvel has put together incredibly talented cast and they are doing what they can to make the movie enjoyable. But their efforts are severely limited by the weak and predictable script. This has to be one of the worst movies in MCU."

One thing is for sure as you walk away from Infinity war.... you're going to be looking up the release date for the next MCU film to see where this goes."

      "text": "The short review: The character and story development are inadequate, many fights scenes felt like nothing new, and the plot felt predictable, but there is enough comedy, anticipation and suspense to make this a good but not great film.Related media: I have seen all the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films, so this review is based on knowing what had happened before.What's it like?: Something happened before the film starts that makes Thanos and his henchmen decides it is finally time to take matters into their own hands to assemble the Infinity Stones themselves. So they move from one location to the next, fighting and killing the current holders of the stones. Will he succeed?Post-credit scene: One at the very end but it\u2019s a must-see.Negatives: 1)\tA major irritation with this film is the slow pacing, sometimes caused by too much pondering and exposition. Thanos\u2019s destruction of one character/location after another has made the mood gloomy, but when the story transitions to another location, it takes too long for the next thing to happen. 2)\tThe film suffers from what critics have been warning for a long time \u2013 too many major characters in one film. Marvel was able to avoid the failures of DC Comics with Suicide Squad and Justice League, and in fact had major successes with Avengers 1 and 2 and Captain America: Civil War, but I think Marvel has reached a tipping point with this film. With so many characters, they could not spend more time with each character and cover character developments other than moving from one fight to the next. 3)\t(Cont\u2019d) An example of this is the fight between Iron Man and a villain. It degenerates into the usual thing of Iron Man shooting lasers and missiles, while being thrown about and smacked with objects. There is nothing new! It becomes another throwaway skirmish, of which there are many in this film.4)\tA real problem with any story where the villain is trying to gather a number of powerful objects, which upon completion would render him/her invincible is, where the story goes from there onwards. This problem is made worse here as Thanos becomes more powerful as he acquires each Infinity Stone, rather than needing to collect them all before getting any power from each stone. This principle makes it ever easier for him to acquire each succeeding stone, such that it is guaranteed that he would complete his task. I am really worried as to how the story writers are going to fix this in Avengers 4.5)\tThere are some opportunities to stop Thanos somewhere in the film but they are wasted because of the stupidity and selfishness of some characters. Some character(s) even surrendered the stones. I think these situations were there just to milk out some drama but they were not well done.6)\tThe massive attack on Wakanda with Thanos\u2019s army \u2013 it\u2019s in the trailer \u2013 does not make sense, considering that prior attempts to acquire the stones had only involved a few super-villains but were executed very expertly. It smacks of a cheap attempt to insert a major battle into the film just to satisfy the fans, when it wasn\u2019t necessary at all.7)\tThe scenes where the heroes who do not know each other meet up for the first time, was not done well. It seemed like the heroes trusted the other side and become friends too easily.8)\tThor and Peter Quill had developed greater powers in recent films, but neither of them used these powers here. Disappointing.9)\tThor remains insecure about not having a hammer and goes to get a new one. The entire sub-plot on this venture felt contrived and felt like an attempt to show a MacGuffin.10)\tThe strange ending was another gloomy scene. The audiences in the same theatre as me, felt drained, depressed and confused when the lights were turned on. Hang on! This could be just what the directors intended, which would make this a positive!11)\tOverall, the story felt predictable and this points to the linear and average story-writing. Guardians of the Galaxy 2 felt the same, but Thor and Civil War were surprising.Positives: 1)\tDespite this film being rather gloomy, there were still many funny moments, something that almost all of the DC Comics films never managed. 2)\tThe film did try to cover the backstory of Thanos, which I wasn\u2019t expecting. Film critics cannot thus argue that this film did not have any character development.3)\tThe beginning of the film had some of our heroes losing continuously and badly to Thanos and his henchmen. When our heroes won decisively for the first time, it felt really great!How would the different age groups rate it?Children: Excellent;Teens: Excellent;Young adults: Good;Medium age adults: Good;Old adults: Average;Rating: 4/5 (no half scores). Pay to watch it in the cinema."

The action was fantastic, there were a few great jokes in there, and for the first time in a very long time I had to fight back tears over something that happens in the movie (seriously glad that moment only lasted for so long because I was ready to unload years of frustration and grief in one moment). It's tough to manage a lot of star power on the screen over 2 1/2 hours but Marvel manages it incredibly well. For the first time in an Avengers movie audiences don't necessarily get what they want and it's both infuriating and amazing. It'll be hard not to dish out spoilers and I won't spill any beans but the table that this movie sets is one of the most intriguing futures I can remember in movies - better than Star Wars (at least post-OG trilogy). Infinity War makes Captain Marvel and whatever the currently unnamed AV4 incredibly important. Bottom line: this is the Avengers movie to see in theaters, and see it in a big one if you can because having a big screen and Dolby Atmos was a blast for myself."
