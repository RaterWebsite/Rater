More woke **** I have a pang of guilt, having never needed to come to the defense of a 19th century fictional character before, but this is Ghostbusters all over again. Right in the description, \"her useless brothers, Sherlock and Mycroft.\" Really? Face facts, Netflix, there would, and never has been, an Enola Holmes super girl detective, without Sherlock. Why the need to denigrate one of the most celebrated fictional detectives in order to sell this? Because nobody cares about some nameless girl detective and she needed the credibility of the original. They did this in the Alienist too; beefed up a female character to be woke. It so unoriginal and childish. Especially given that there are plenty of talented women writers out there that could write an original script/character. Yet another attempted cash in of an established genre/franchise."

Sherlock Holmes is in the Movie and plays the \u201cbad farther\u201d roll. Meaning more often than not he is lectured through out the movie. The movie employs the \u201cMary Sue\u201d writing style. Enola is a young child that understands the world better than Sherlock Holmes. She is a better fighter than a trained assassin. She commands the respect of adults regardless of her age due to her superior intellect. If the viewer at any point catches on to type of movie it is easy to figure out that the villain must be a woman. In these movies any character of note is generally a woman. Finally the message of the movie is that world needs to change and become more progressive which is made clear in the first act.Weather you like this genre of film or not it has interesting parts. The movie tries to keep a balance of a strong feminist story and an interesting story for everyone. Enola is a great fighter. The movie makes sure to show her learn this skill. She has a superior intellect and her education is shown through the movie. The lead actress has proven herself many times over and is entertaining. The movie does a good job of fixing issues with this genre but at the end of the day it\u2019s more of the same. With lines like \u201cyour a man when I say you are\u201d and Sherlock Holme\u2019s character being lectured by an African American (England?) women about white privilege it just detracts from the story.

El guion es culpable de ambas, tanto por \"mal representar\" un prop\u00f3sito socialmente importante como por querer llenar la pel\u00edcula de aventuras igualmente mal desarrolladas. La trayectoria de Enola es desenfocada y se otorga responsabilidades que la desv\u00edan de su propio objetivo. Los \"nuevos\" caminos le permiten aprender del mundo y de ella misma, pero esto provoca que la autonom\u00eda de Enola est\u00e9 a la disposici\u00f3n de los menos responsables. Como diciendo \"yo soy m\u00e1s inteligente que t\u00fa, tomar\u00e9 responsabilidad de tus problemas\" (una idea algo irresponsable que promueve el abuso). En fin, esto se disfraza con un romance mudo y entre miradas de la forma m\u00e1s clich\u00e9 posible y elimina cualquier prop\u00f3sito de empoderamiento en la pel\u00edcula. Las ideolog\u00edas de los dem\u00e1s personajes son tan dr\u00e1sticas que no permite ning\u00fan debate. Todos estaremos de acuerdo con lo mismo de siempre. Tambi\u00e9n hay un esfuerzo por hacer notar que Enola no lo sabe todo y eso trata de agregar intriga y madurez al ambiente, pero realmente solo genera una auto-contradicci\u00f3n que anula cualquier lecci\u00f3n previamente aprendida. Por lo tanto, la actuaci\u00f3n de Millie Bobby Brown se reduce a un personaje con poco sentido que le gusta hablar consigo misma, y Henry Cavill, Sam Claflin, Helena Bonham, Louis Partridge y Fiona Shaw no aportan ni muestran un impulso importante. El \u00fanico esfuerzo visual, aunque no sorprende, es el vestuario. Ni la fotograf\u00eda, ni la m\u00fasica. \"Enola Holmes\" falla en llamar la atenci\u00f3n de j\u00f3venes y adultos en esta historia, pues esta pel\u00edcula es una mon\u00f3tona distracci\u00f3n que entretiene solo a las audiencias poco experimentadas.-\"Enola Holmes\" is the first movie of Harry Bradbeer, who has a long career in TV Shows, and is written by Jack Thorne, whose greatest success has been collaborating in the adaptation of the script of \"Wonder\" (2017) movie. \"Enola Holmes\" is an inoffensive story that makes too little to inspire and too much to entertain. The script is to blame for both of them: for wrongly presenting a socially relevant purpose and for wanting to fill the movie with adventures equally poorly developed. Enola's trajectory is blurry and takes responsibilities that divert her from her own mission. The \"new\" paths allow her to learn from the world and from herself, but this causes that Enola's autonomy to be in the disposition of those less responsible. Like saying \"I'm more intelligent than you, I'll take responsibility of your problems\" (an irresponsible idea that promotes abuse). Anyway, this is disguised by a speechless romance between glances made in the most cliche possible way and erases any empowerment purpose of the movie. The other character's ideologies are too drastic that they don't permit any debate. We all will be agree with the same things as always. There's also an effort to show that Enola \"doesn't know everything\" and tries to add some intrigue and maturity in the ambient, but that only creates a self-contradiction that nullifies any lection previously learned. Therefore, the acting of Millie Bobby Brown gets reduced to a character with not much sense that likes to speak to herself. Henry Cavill, San Claflin, Helena Bonham, Louise Partridge, and Fiona Shaw doesn't provide or show any relevant acting moment. The only visual effort, but not surprising, is the costume design. Not photography, nor music. \"Enola Holmes\" fails to call the attention of young and grown-ups in this story since this movie is a monotonous distraction that will entertain only the least experimented audiences."

He made it to be a light-hearted coming of age film with some name recognition, a hint of mystery, and an inspirational end. You\u2019ll remember Enola Holmes for the bright characters and delightful performances, not so much for the story. It\u2019s clear Harry Bradbeer knew what the strengths of the film were and played to them. With a better story and a focus on Enola\u2019s sleuthing skills, a sequel could easily become something exceptional."

No wonder Conan Doyle's estate are suing, the movie is filmed in a quirky late 20th century manner, and it violates the spirit of Conan Doyle's works with metaphorical anvils for the crudest of motives, personal opinion.

I am glad that this film had a feminist message, but the feminism was ham-handed. Social justice is something that needs to be achieved still, and woman-positive media is a way to help achieve that.What was most reprehensible and anti-Holmesian was the fourth wall breaking; the direct speaking to the audience that was annoying and unrealistic and unnecessary. Also, The story was not compelling. The old \"what happened to character X that disappeared suddenly without a trace\" trope as the first mystery was boring. Furthermore, the use of clues was not typical of Sherlock Holmes. The deduction that Enola used was based on her personal knowledge of her mother, rather than keen observation, the deep pool of knowledge that Sherlock Holmes gains through reading, or his network, which Sherlock uses to solve mysteries. Indeed, Enola had no network because she was cooped up and home-schooled by her mother, played by an unoriginal and overrated Helena Bonham Carter.The relationship and age of all the Holmes doesn't make sense and seemed forced, although some marriages did start at a very early age for many young \"women\" in the 1800s. There's barely 17 years between Cavill and Carter and Mycroft is supposed to be 7 years older than Sherlock, so... mother at 10? Before the average girl's first menses? Please. Despite trying to be pro-woman, this film continued Hollywood's infantilization of women and cast an unrealistically young mother Holmes. They should have went with a older, more intelligent woman.Lastly, I thought Calvill's acting was wooden and dull. He didn't seem to be processing much in his head like a real Sherlock would. Of course, some of this is due to his writing, which made him to look inferior to the upstart Enola, because this movie is both anti-man and young adult fiction. This could have been a much better film."

I really liked the film on it's first minutes.Then it happened...For real, I do not want to say: \"Ughh this is such a bad adaptation that's why it sucks\"Real problem here is that in one point you realize this is a Netflix production so you can expect some forced topics. But that's not the real problem, and by the way, are we seriously going to forget that Helena's character was trying to make a terrorist attack? I though she was being framed or something but turns it was more real than I thought. After finishing the film couldn't avoid to think that, for real, there's no even way to justify that Netflix and Millie (Who produces this by the way)Henry is perfect, though he couldn't fit the role but he does, althought of course it's kind of a different version of the Sherlock we know, some changes but it's Sherlock. Real and HUGE problem comes with Mycroft, if he would've turned into the person behind everything this movie would have a large zero, lucky for us he is just a selfish who hates feminism. Mycroft in books it's almost smart as Sherlock is, but here they turned him into an stupid and annonying brother, in the end he is just that, nothing else, but come on, Sam does what he best can and that script they gave him it's stupid, when they made him yell during the trip with Enola, it was cringy, lame, I mean, they're really trying to make him look like the bad anti-feminist guy. Awful.And finally, Enola is smart, but she didn't solve the case. She went to the house with another idea, and she found the answer there but didn't solve anything. Sherlock did it and somehow she takes the credit, ALL the credit. And again, she didn't solve anything.It's fun to watch, it has some good moments but for real and I can't stop thinking about this while I'm writing.HELENA'S CHARACTER WAS TRYING TO MAKE A TERRORIST ATTACK! And they justify it with the fact that she was fighting for women rights. Really, can't stop thinking about this, but go on, watch it, not recommend it but it's not like it's unwatchable."

Henry Cavill also does a pretty good job here too and I wish we got to see more of his take on Sherlock Holmes. The film is well shot but it doesn\u2019t do anything creative with its shots and the production design, costume design, and score are all pretty good. Everything else however was definitely below average. The plot is fast which is nice but certain elements of the story are not engaging at points. The setups and pay offs are so predictable that you could see them coming from a mile away. The editing is very dull and rapid and there are some very obvious green screen moments here and there. I took a lot of issue with the 4th wall breaks. It felt out of place and awkward at many points and really ground the film to a halt when it happened. I know they need to explain some elements but it could have been done much better than that. Go check this out on Netflix if you are a fan of Millie Bobbie Brown or Henry Cavill or if you enjoy the universe of Sherlock Holmes. If you don\u2019t like any of those elements, then you can definitely pass on this."

      "text": "An interesting concept that has almost no payoff throughout the entire movie. The storytelling style (i.e. flashbacks to scenes we had no context for previously to explain current scenes) removed almost any emotional punch from any reveals. Hardly any mystery whatsoever."

      "text": "Movie felt like targeting toward younger audience below 13. Lacks of crime solving really didn't do justice for Enola skills and talent as Holmes characters. Not much cleverness you expect from typical Sherlock Holmes film or series. The character connection and development between Enola and her Mother are probably the high point of this movie. Movie overall is simple thrill with Good cast with touch of teenage romance."

      "text": "I had never before seen anything by Millie Bobby Brown, and still her Enola wasn't believable. Bad acting, too much breaking the fourth wall, with a very bad script and two brothers that were just used for the \"men are evil\" trope and not even faithful to the original stories. Full of political agenda, completely predictable, with a romantic storyline that makes no sense, and no brilliant deductions anywhere to be found. A real insult to the Holmes franchise."
