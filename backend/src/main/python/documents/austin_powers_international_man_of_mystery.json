But can he stop megalomaniac Dr. Evil after the bald villain freezes himself and unthaws in the '90s? With the help of sexy sidekick Vanessa Kensington, he just might.",

It would be nice if the sequals would return the simple formula that works so well in this original Austin Powers: Two relics of the '60s who are hopelessly out of touch with the late '90s. We don't need Austin and Evil traveling back in time because they are much funnier to watch trying to get up to speed with the present. Right up there with Airplane and Naked Gun."

      "text": "Words cannot describe how wonderful this film was. The story is admittedly daft, but the film itself is witty, sophisticated and hysterically stupid, while being fast, furious and fun as well. The humour is hilarious to the point of sides splitting, from the mocking of the fashion and musical style of the Swinging Sixties period, to countless references to 007, Matt Helm and Our Man Flint. And Austin's catchphrases?... groovy! The film looks amazing, with bright colourful sets and great costumes, and the soundtrack is funky. Then we have Mike Myers brilliant as Austin Powers(better than he was in Cat in the Hat anyway, the less said about that travesty the better), and hysterically over-the-top as the arch-nemesis Dr Evil, and Elizabeth Hurley fabulously sexy as Vanessa Kensington. Overall, wonderful film, better than I thought it would be. Shagadelic, baby! 9/10 Bethany Cox"

Mike Myers is great, as I said above, but over all, this isn't one of his best."

      "text": "A send up of the spy movie genre with an exaggerated sense of humor. Mike Myers brings the whole thing to life. Not only did he write the movie, but he stars as both the hero and the villain of it. It's his performances and passion for the project that brings the whole thing to life and makes it very funny.\r Plenty of inside references and clever nods to the spy movies it so lovingly pokes fun at are found throughout. There are also plenty of visual cues and insights towards what life was like in the 60's. Both are infused and used throughout. It gives the film a tone and sense of humor all it's own.\r It's a rather brief affair. It sticks around just long enough to get it's jokes out and it moves on. You might be left wanting more from the plot and more content overall, but it's hard to criticize it too much when it does what it set out to do this well. It's a very funny movie and one worth watching. Myers brings his spy movie vision to life with an over-the-top sense of humor and it's joy to watch thanks to the almost constant stream of jokes in throws at you."

      "text": "Alotta **** Need I say more? The first film in the Austin Powers series, \"Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery\" sets the tone in a amusingly camp and whimsical way for the preceding sequels. Mike Myers does what Eddie Murphy largely failed to do in \"The Nutty Professor\" or \"Norbit\" - that being portraying multiple characters who both DON'T outshine the other and provide equal amount of laughs. Although there are a lot of references to 1960 spy flicks (namely the Bond pictures) anybody who enjoys a good comedy will adore this movie."

When Dr Evil returns 30 years later Powers is thawed back into action to once again foil his nemeses plan to take over the world. Spoofing almost every spy film ever made Austin Powers International Man of Mystery is one of those rare movies that is actually laugh out loud funny. Much of the humour comes from Austin\u2019s total failure to adapt to his 90\u2019s surroundings but, as with the sequel, it is really Dr Evil who steals the show with some fantastic one liners that are still quoted two decades later.A true comedy classic."

      "text": "To be fair the enjoyment fully depends if you like this kind of humor. It can cover the full range from 1/10 to 10/10 but I will say it is to carefully made to be rated lower than a 4/10 even if you dislike the humor. It is a parody of James Bond and Mike Myers humor unleashed. It delivers for me with the humor. It has all sorts from clever jokes, satire, toilet humor up to some really dirty jokes. Most of the jokes work but there are some awkward once too. Would say 80% work and 20% fail for me if I had to do the numbers. The story starts in the swinging sixties.  The world class spy (and style icon;-) Austin Powers foils an assassination attempt by his evil antagonist Dr. Evil who then escapes to space and freezes himself. Austin Powers has no other choice as to be placed also in cryostasis and wait for the return of his nemesis. 30 years later their duel continues. Like I already said it is a parody of all James Bond tropes and cliches. It archives to be respectful to the sources but also not holding back on the humor side. I repeat Mike Myers humor here is not everyone's taste but he convinced many people with this movie. The acting is great for this sort of movie. Lets start with Mike Myers (actually Michael John Myers) in his role as Austin (Danger;-) Powers and Dr. Evil. You fully feel the fun and enjoyment he had and this make the movie really good. It helps that he was also the writer and one of the producers so he can fully develop his ideas. Elizabeth Hurley as Vanessa Kensington does a remarkable job. She is such a good alternative or parody to the Bond girls. For the rest I liked Seth Green as Scott Evil, Robert Wagner as Number 2 (Has he a real name in the franchise?) and of cause Mindy Lee Stirling as Mrs Farbissina who steals the show with her performance. Special praise to Will Ferell as Mustafa for his awesome scene (You will know which I mean). Visually the movie fully delivers.  The wanted a specific style and got it right. The soundtrack is great but not my cup of tea so I will exclude it from my rating. On the negative side I already said that 20% of the jokes dont work for me and the start of the movie is a bit slow. Other than that I think there are no memorable missteps. Overall this is a great parody for James Bond movies. It is entertaining enough that I recommend it if you like this kind of humor."

The movie is full of quoteable lines (for example, \"I'm going to place them in an easily escapable situation involving an overly complicated and exotic death\" and of course, \"I shall hold the world hostage for... One MILLION dollars!\") and cleverly pokes fun at various spy movie clich\u00e9s. Austin Powers himself is a funny character and a clever joke on how out of place James Bond feels in modern day. If you like James Bond and you like spoofs, I'd recommend this, baby!"
