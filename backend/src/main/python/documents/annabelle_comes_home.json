The writing, directing and story really lack the finesse that they had in Creation and the acting doesn\u2019t really do too much to get around this. The entire movie revolves around character curiosity and stupidity which makes this movie feel really inconsequential with regards to both the franchise and the Conjuring universe at large. ACH didn\u2019t need to happen and only happened because of the actions of one character in the movie, which makes it feel like it was just made just to get some money out of fans of the previous two movies and the Conjuring universe. The film doesn\u2019t progress the storyline of the franchise or universe and only ties into the other movies at one moment that doesn\u2019t add much to the movie or the story. The worst part is that even the scares themselves aren\u2019t too good; they\u2019re really cliche and are jump scares for the most part, so the horror in this movie is pretty boring and uninteresting which makes a lot of it feel like a drag. There is a cheesy romance plot that attempts to distract from the scary stuff but more succeeds in making the film cringey and awkward at times, a not nice juxtaposition to the so-so horror that dominates the rest of the movie. The acting is ok but nothing special and doesn\u2019t add much emotion or depth to the movie and makes a lot of the dialogue and interactions fairly uninteresting. There are a few redeeming qualities, though. The end is decent and \u201csweet\u201d in a way I didn\u2019t expect, wraps the movie up nicely, and manages to contain some lessons for the viewers and characters. Those lessons are cliche and generic, but they are still important lessons about life and how to not cause really bad situations, so the movie does attempt to redeem itself from the boredom that dominates a lot of it and tries to prevent situations like ACH from happening again in the franchise. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, although they\u2019re not in a lot of the movie, are welcome faces and highlights in the parts of the movie that they\u2019re in and yet again do a great job portraying Ed and Lorraine Warren. It\u2019s nice to see them in parent and mentoring rather than paranormal investigator roles; it\u2019s a breath of fresh air and a nice part of this movie. Overall, while ACH does have a few good things in it, for the most part it\u2019s a big letdown from its predecessor and is a bit boring and unengaging."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Annabelle Comes Home has the titular possessed doll causing a ruckus in the Warren's collection of cursed objects unleasing the creatures in the house in what the creators call a scary version of Night at the Museum. What ensues, while not the scariest film in the Conjuring-verse, is a fun experience.This movie is more upbeat than the last two Annabelle movies (including a few funny lines.) Kind of surprising considering that this is written and directed by Gary Dauberman, who wrote the last two films. The ending to the last film is one of the darkest in the Conjuring franchise, so Dauberman's pivot is surprising. However, since this revolves around the house and daughter (Mckenna Grace) of the stars of the main film line, I can see why Dauberman didn't want to do anything that would really rock the boat and affect them in the long run. Also, it'd just be hard to compete with the tone of the last film, which in my opinon was the best.Understand that when I say this is more upbeat, I'm not saying this film isn't scary. It just has more of a popcorn/funhouse horror feel. Ever since the Warrens' collection of possessed and cursed objects was introduced, I think everyone has been itching to explore them more, and you definitely get your payoff. There are some pretty creepy ghosts in here, including one inventive being that isn't in the commercials and I won't spoil.I do wish the other ghosts were given more to do. Annabelle still bears the load. I just wanted to see the ghosts have some more physicality and violence. (Yes, the samurai armor from the earlier films is still in the collection. No, it doesn't unsheathe it's sword. I know, right?!) Also, there is one ghost who mostly tangles with Michael Cimino's character that is mostly done using computer animation and doesn't work as well as the other more practical-looking monsters.Considering that this is a first time director, this looks pretty nice. There are some nicely shot scares. They don't compete with the best of the series, but they work. A lot of thought must have went into the set design. This really looks like it takes place during the seventies.The three main leads are pretty likable, especially Katie Sarife's character. At first you worry that she's the stereotypical party friend to the lead who makes bad decisions. Yeah, she kind of does that latter part, but her character goes in a way that is unexpected and fleshes her out.If you were looking forward to seeing Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) and Ed Warren (Patrick WIlson), be prepared that they really aren't in this that much.I'd rank this above Annabelle 1, The Nun, and La Llorona, and below the Conjurings and Annabelle Creation. This isn't the scariest or most technically proficient film in the franchise, but this doesn't miss by that much. If you're just looking for something visually interesting that is just trying to entertain, then I recommend this."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "The franchise has been through a lot of ups and downs, and this is up there, I am exhausted and thrilled and properly conjured by the Universe.Anabelle Comes HomeDauberman has wisely left his signature business out of this house. As a result, the Conjuring Universe finds its not-only-stable but one brisky tale that comes with a caution of \"brace yourself\" after a long time. This franchise fascinates me. Let me put it that way simply. For somehow within its flaws and incompetency, this series contradicts itself perpetually. And there is something honestly raw and ambitious about it. Just like those so called spirits, a chapter every now and then pops up with a tremendous strength and manages to take all the attention for granted resulting into a mano-y-mano experience of western style filmmaking in the end.And that is why, the high points of the series, the good chapters, are the one that can be related personally by the viewers. Not by the characters, for somehow every installment always ends up maniacally breaking the most closest relations of the characters. And this one stands tall in that matter. The formula is so simple and yet so effective. The pseudo reaction to the infamous Warren couple's (Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson) work casts a muttering inexpressible and unnoticeable impact on their daughter- which is exaggerated smarty by introducing this chapter- Judy Warren played powerfully by McKenna Grace.I don't know how to express Grace, but let me try starting by the crux of the Universe that ignited all this fandom, Farmiga. And I am a part of it. Farmiga is my kryptonite. I accept it gracefully. Not because I hold Jason Reitman's Up In The Air, dearly, but in fact it came from this very role of hers. My mother says her behaviour is bizarrely similar to my grandmother, whom I never met. And the way she sees those dead beings through and through like some transparent being- irony!- no one in the franchise has managed to embody that emotionally welcoming firmness.Grace glances at those no-good doers with the same sharpness. She lacks the humility and pain in her looks but it fits in perfectly, since she is inexperienced and new to the field. This is why I would lean towards all the assumptions made in the franchise with enthusiasm and gullibility. The Universe that curses and creates and conjures, there is not a single scratch on the real life based characters that it whispers about. Their behaviour, language and characteristics speaks more about this demonic world than any of the cases ever could. Ergo, the franchise despite taking lethal blows, enters the 12th round every night.Also, I wonder why the live screen time feels more personal and easily adaptable than your average narration. I mean, every now and then it does and has to strain. And it does here, too. But I don't mind it. Not the build up nor the anticipation of the screams and gasps. I respect the teasing game especially when it doesn't reveal its trump card. And after this franchise, I can understand that even ignorance is a part of the game. Anabelle Comes Home with the best gift wrapped around her tiny wooden cold hands, it is everything you dream of, every nightmare."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Definitely the current horror is in crisis. This looks more like a comedy movie with so many \"funny\" moments. A werewolf, really?"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "7.8/10 The third film in the Annabelle series marks Gary Dauberman's directorial debut and it's a good start for the seasoned and acclaimed horror writer. This story does echo familiar with certain thematics/aspects that we've seen in this film universe, with youth being the focal point surrounded by the paranormal phenomenon. The plot does take a little bit of time to develop and maybe spends too much time trying to develop some of the characters before anything really exciting does happen. Once things do start going bump, it does get very fast paced and thoroughly foreboding at times all while staying grounded with the plot.The overall setting of the Warren house fits the particular story very well and adds nice substance with the artifacts room. The late 60s ambience is perfectly done and sets a terrific tone, and the lighting/ camera work is phenomenal as usual for the series. There are many different callbacks to other films in the universe with familiar entities as well as a few new very creepy ones making frightful sporadic appearances. It almost acts as a conjuring universe greatest hits if you will which isn't a bad thing and was actually quite fun. The finale finishes off the film in excellent fashion with with a fantastic culmination of events, and once again I was left wanting more for the series, be it another Annabelle or the upcoming conjuring 3.Some of the scares also get a little bit clich\u00e9 at times but they do enough to keep them fresh a majority of the time. Overall this gets the conjuring universe back on track after the last 2 middling to decent films released (The Nun/La LLorona). If you enjoy the series/universe, this is a must see."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "I can\u2019t really call this a bad film, but it was disappointing because there was so little of the original actors and so much of their daughter and her teenage friends and their annoying preoccupations. That said, these were better teen actors than usual although what they were up to most of the time was not what horror fans are interested in (e.g., baking a birthday cake).

There was never innovation of course but at least The Conjuring 1 and 2 are redeemable.The rest of the films that have been made in this film universe are of a very poor quality, only Annabelle Creation deserves a more positive opinion.It's clear to me that this type of horror has become a stamp and guide for much of the audience. People like it and the studio knows it very well. The focus of this franchise is spend little, give them the same a little scrambled and they will continue to consume it.Annabelle Comes Home is not what I would call a frontal failure but it shows once more the shortcomings of these films to build better stories.The plot is practically nonexistent and we only see a continuous succession of events to try to justify the whole thing and whether you want it or not, that damages the film. At least for those who are more interested in seeing something more than noise and figures in the dark background followed by predictable jump scares.I honestly think this franchise has already exhausted its ''charm'' and they're not doing anything relevant anymore.

This also leads to a super quick ending that just wraps up awkwardly. Also, I can\u2019t hate on the film too much because it is Gary Dauberman\u2019s first time directing but I think he overkilled it with the whole tension build up during some scenes. Because there was a long build up to something it just lost its scare factor in some cases. The ending felt like three completely different films just mixed into one as if this one wouldn\u2019t make enough to make the other two. This isn\u2019t that big of a deal but to the person in charge of making the house match up with the others failed. The clothes match up it\u2019s just the house set that didn\u2019t match up. But like I said this isn\u2019t that big of a deal but it still just bugs me because I already know what the house looks like. Will give the movie props for having a great atmosphere set up though because in every scene you knew what kind of scene it was going to be. But it also loses marks for not having bright enough lighting to see what was going on in certain scenes. Everybody did decent jobs in the acting department. I thought I wasn\u2019t going to like Mckenna Grace as Judy but in the end, she did an amazing job. I also loved seeing Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga back as Ed and Lorraine.

Begrudgingly so, I might add, for none of them have really offered any sort of satisfaction, entertainment value, or long-lasting impression of any sort. So where else was I supposed to set my expectations for this third film other than at \"dangerously low\" levels? Turns out I misjudged things. No, \"Annabelle Comes Home\" doesn't revamp the horror movie fabric or even represent an outstanding version of what it sets out to be. But it also doesn't suck. At all, even. It's a damn fine time, featuring surprisingly well-thought-out characters, simple, yet effective performances, and even a few scares here and there that felt fresh and new.

A part of me really admires the Conjuring movies because despite everything they\u2019ve managed to turn 7 movies into a successful franchise and I don\u2019t see them stopping any time soon.

This instalment also marks the return of famous paranormal investigators, Ed and Lorraine Warren including their daughter, Judy Warren.Taking place directly after the prologue and before the main story of The Conjuring, Ed and Lorraine Warren took custody of the Annabelle doll from the two nurses, whom the doll terrorised them. The Warrens believed that the doll was too dangerous and they locked the doll in a sacred glass to contain the evil and place it in the artifacts room within their house.After the events of The Conjuring, the Warrens are leaving town for a night to investigate a case and they left a babysitter named Mary Ellen (Iseman) to look after Judy (Grace) while they are away. Mary\u2019s friend, Daniela Rios (Sarife), unexpectedly shows up at the house to join her friend. While Mary and Judy are outside, Daniela breaks into the artifacts room.Ignoring the warning sign inside the artifacts room, she touches all of the haunted artifacts and opens the sacred glass where the Annabelle doll is locked in. As she hears Mary and Judy returning, she quickly left the room but she forgets to lock the sacred glass.

Judy Warren is the main character in this movie and it is also great to have her in the main role since she only has minor roles in the first two Conjuring movies.Mckenna Grace, Madison Iseman and Katie Sarife have done a great job with their performance similar to how the casts of Annabelle: Creation have done with their performance. The three young actresses really put in a lot of effort into their acting which is very impressive and not too bland.Gary Dauberman, who made his directorial debut and served as writer and executive producer of the previous instalments, has done a great job in making this movie real good. Being attached as director for this movie is a great choice because Dauberman has the most experience in this horror franchise. The movie would have end up worst if he is not the director.Although some jump scares are quite predictable and you can see it coming from afar, the jump scares are not being overuse just to make the movie scary like most of the today\u2019s horror movies.

It\u2019s not great but it\u2019s not bad. Here are the negatives. The film starts to become over reliant on jump scares in the second half. Every other scene you are waiting for that jump scare and then boom jump scare. This leads to the film being generally not scary and I don\u2019t mean just jump scares. They aren\u2019t a lot of concepts or ideas presented that are genuinely terrifying. That\u2019s why films like The Shining, Get Out, and The Exorcist are legitimately terrifying because of the ideas that are presented in those films. That\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t interesting concepts presented in the film but that\u2019s about it for them, concepts which leads to my next point. There are ideas presented in this film that really aren\u2019t explored a lot. The Chinese soldier armor, the TV that shows a couple seconds into the future, and the Cymbal Monkey are really interesting and cool but they aren\u2019t explored a lot. The scenes with these objects are great but they are only on screen for about a minute or two and yes I know there might be films about those objects in the future but I wish we got to learn a little more about those objects. Katie Sarife and Madison Iseman didn\u2019t do that great of a job in this film. In some scenes they were decent but in others they weren\u2019t even trying. The boyfriend subplot is just kinda dumb and he is only there to save a character in one scene and that is it. The film is tonally inconsistent. About a minute after they defeat Annabelle, the main characters make jokes about going to homecoming. Some scenes are undercut by jokes and it\u2019s obnoxious. Here are the positives. I think the first 30 minutes of the film is fantastic. It\u2019s paced really well, it\u2019s creepy, and the performances are really good. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga do a great job in every scene they are in. Mckenna Grace was also pretty good in this film. There are a couple of moments where she isn\u2019t trying but for the most part she does a good job. As I said earlier, some of the ideas and concepts presented in this film are really interesting and I hope we get to learn more about them in the future. There are a handful of good scares in the film but they come from the first half instead of the second half. The film does build up tension really well and makes the somewhat smart choice to cut out the music in these moments. Unfortunately, these moments of tension are undercut by random jumpscares. You do get to see the demon towards the end of the film and the makeup on it looks pretty good. The cinematography is fine but there are a handful of really good shots in the film. Overall, Annabelle Comes Home has a fantastic beginning but starts to rely on jump scares instead of diving into new and interesting concepts.

It is a very entertaining and fun movie though it is not as scary as Annebelle Creation. The movie creates tension and has several jumpscares, but overall it was beautifully shot and the new demons were amazing. The wedding dress demon, for example, was as creepy as the Bride in Black from Insidious"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Loved this movie! the hauntings are very scary, plus Annabelle 3 awakens to an even wider universe of creepy stories."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "A shallow film, does not delve into anything, does not scare, does not frighten.

David Sandberg put on his best James Wan impersonation and created a slow-burn frightfest that explodes into an full-on nightmare in its final act, and is backed up by a narrative and cast of characters that are almost as good as the ones you'll find in the two main Conjuring films. Gary Dauberman tried to do that exact same thing here, but his story and scares just aren't as strong.Annabelle takes her sweet time unpacking when she gets home, so don't expect her to settle back into her routine of freaking people out right away. The film drags for a while as we're introduced to its stars. Normally I would praise a horror movie for taking the time to flesh out its characters, but with the exception of the Warren's daughter they're just one-dimensional and uninteresting teenagers. Spending time with them simply isn't any fun, especially when one of them only exists to bring us the stupidest and least funny reoccurring joke ever conceived. They're also the kind of white people that will have non-white people yelling \"WHITE PEOPLE!\" at the screen in disbelief.When Dauberman does finally decide to capitalize on the film's excellent premise of having everything in the Warren's artifacts room go off at once it becomes a much more entertaining experience. It lacks an identity of its own though. The scare tactics used are the exact same ones you'll find in any of the other Conjuring Universe films and the titular antagonist ends up somewhat lost amongst all the other demons unleashed in the movie. You'll still get your jumps and jolts, but not in any ways you haven't seen before. At least the soul stealing demon behind Annabelle is just as terrifying as ever.Comes Home may be a sign that it's time to shakeup the Conjuring formula already. At the very least it's a reminder of how vital the story and characters have been to this franchise's success. Without them the most noteworthy aspects of this third outing with the evil possessed doll are that it plays off of the shared universe concept in the biggest ways so far by including the Warrens (if only briefly), appears to set up several more spin-offs, and that it is better than the first Annabelle. Other than that it's the cinematic equivalent of waiting 2+ hours in line for a haunted house that ends up being mediocre."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "The third Annabelle film isn't as good as part 2, but has some good scares. Overall it feels more like a modern day Hammer Horror, as the cheese factor is increased to be more marketable to tweens."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "While \u201cAnnabelle Comes Home\u201d is a decent way to pass time, the film is a cacophony of missed opportunities as it deals its brilliant premise with kiddy gloves."}], "recommendations": ["ouija_origin_of_evil", "the_conjuring_the_devil_made_me_do_it", "insidious_chapter_3", "insidious_the_last_key", "colossal", "the_ritual", "annabelle_creation", "scary_stories_to_tell_in_the_dark", "the_girl_with_all_the_gifts", "lights_out", "us", "dark_skies", "a_cure_for_wellness", "color_out_of_space", "happy_death_day_2u", "brightburn", "the_curse_of_la_llorona", "sinister_2", "the_invasion", "chernobyl_diaries", "insidious_chapter_2", "a_quiet_place_part_ii", "it_follows", "the_conjuring_2", "it"]}
