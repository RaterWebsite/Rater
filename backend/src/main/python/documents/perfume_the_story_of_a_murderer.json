It's unfortunate that my review will likely be edited before posting (if posted at all) since it's not PC at the moment to insult other reviewers, but sadly on the other hand, it is quite fashionable to trash anything and everyone that has anything to do with Iraq without a shred of logic to one's insane accusations. On a separate note, the movie was great with a very original storyline coupled with excellent acting and directing. Oh and to answer your question Nanifaye P., what's horrific is that you seem to believe every last bit of nonsense you hear and have the gusto to regurgitate it in something as apolitical as a movie review about perfume. Quite frankly, I'm not quite sure who's sicker, the main character of the movie, or you."

This is one of those movies that gives the viewer an impression that: A) it was made specifically for a good trailer, and B) it was made under the supposition that the viewers are stupid. Dustin Hoffman (who is otherwise brilliant) gives the worst performance of his career. The movie is set in France, but everyone has British accents, aside from the main character (who speaks some strange brew of Cockney) and Hoffman (who speaks some strange brew of Yiddish/Brooklyn). I'm wondering if they should have just cut to the chase and given us 147 minutes of extreme closeups of the main character--because there is nothing more to this film. The people in the audience were yelling out loud at the stupidity of this film, and as I exited, I overheard someone say, \"walk of shame. . .\"."

With a gripping story, takes you on a visual journey to there and gives us a rich history of this man, Grenouille. Ben Whishaw **** perfect on paper. The scene of the \"execution\" it is one of the craziest I've ever seen. Hard to take your eyes off the television."

First off, whereas Tom Tykwer had a few strong strokes of originality in Run Lola Run, he proves in this film that he is without a doubt a masterful hack. The entire adpatation is sophmoric, employing an idiotic narrator voiceover that redefines the definition of cliche. In fact there are so many problems in this movie such as hystrionic acting, horrible dialects, and a narrative structure so misguided, you sit in the audience and after an hour wonder if this is all a big joke. And whereas you typically don't isolate one person as having the responsibilty for a movie going sour - in this particualr film, there is no other individual responsible for this movie tanking than Tom Tykwer. With material that requires clever dramatic and visual structure, and a unique sense of style, all we get is cliche, bread-and-butter drab, Tom, I gotta hand it to you, your directing is so awful in this, so stuffy, self-serious, and suffering from delusional egomania, that you've made \"American Pie\" look like \"The Godfather\" in comparison. I know this sounds harsh, but at least \"American Pie\" knew its place as a movie. In keeping with your tradition of cliches, all I have to say is \"Your film stinks.\""

He survived through scent and it ironically lead to his demise. [**SPOILER**] The only out of place and seemingly ridiculous scene was the orgy that made a 10 an 8."

If the investigation sequence toward the end had been trimmed down (I think that part is ten pages in the book) and had Dustin Hoffman picked an accent and stuck with it, it might have been my favorite movie of the year. Not that there aren't other problems, but the film carries a sense of LIFE about it that no other film this year quite has. It's a fantasy that's real. I suspect that he and the other stars were cast because Tykwer liked their noses, but Whishaw is perfect as Grenouille -- he's supposed to be totally empty, a non-entity, someone who would never be noticed on the street, and he does all these things while still managing to hold the attention of the viewer. I suspect that in order to really get this film, one must have felt as though he or she was invisible at some point: Grenouille is an invisible man who manages to force himself to be noticed. And the conclusion is great; very appropriate. It may take some thinking to come to this conclusion, but at the end Grenouille, for a few shining minutes, Grenouille is a power for (almost) good."

I like most of Tykwer's work (Heaven, Run Lola Run, The Warrior and The Empress) so I thought everything would be fine. But it turned out to be an enjoyable (a bit long) evening. But nothing more. So it disappointed me. And therefore my low points. It was a big thing here in Germany, so they should at least put some more German or at least French actors in it."

As such, his quest is almost more important than the females he must snuff to reach his goal. We almost admire the final scene in which he may now die because he has driven everyone into a sense of euphoria. I suppose this is where the tale bridges from somewhat real into the stuff of urban legends. However weird the ending, his quest is both evil and purely idealistic. His victims are captured forever in his tiny bottle."

However these achievements are routinely reached with a little bit of cash. Aside from that it failed to suspend disbelief, failed to build an attachment with the audience to any one of its characters, and three quarts of the way through descended into utter ridiculousness and never looked back. The pitiful ending was to be expected; nothing could save it after it had fallen so spectacularly. There are a thousand films which manage to combine excellent cinematography, acting and production with an engaging and interesting plot, and those films should be seen before bothering with this one."

It was not offensive to my eyes or my tastes, because the murders were done in such a way that the imagery was beautiful, not horrific. There was nothing frightening or scary about his actions, because they were done for what he saw as a higher cause.

      "text": "Perfume is a visually lavish dark fairy tale about an obsessive man seeking beauty and recognition in a morally void society.  The protagonist is born with a super-human sense of smell, a will to live, and nothing more.  Born and bred in a world where life is treated as a distant and vulgar second to money, we see the development of a man who relates to beauty only as possession, one more smell to be collected and preserved.  Finding the women who possess these scents to be obstacles to his obsession, he murders them, destroying them in the process of creating the most powerfully exquisite scent the world has ever known.  It is not until the end of the film when he finally glimpses the dimension of beauty that issues from contact, from sharing--in a word, love--that he is able to feel any form of remorse.  Until then his quest to objectify and possess beauty and to force upon the world the value of his existence is mirrored by the society around him, from the brutal exploitation of the Parisian slums to the trophies and conceits of the nobility.  Perfume is a sensual marvel of a movie that explores morality and the profane in a lyrical way."

      "text": "This film portrays the life of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, a French perfumer whose genius turns into madness. Directed by Tom Tykwer, who also collaborated on the screenplay alongside Andrew Birkin and Bernd Eichinger, it has Ben Whishaw in the main role and features also interpretations of Alan Rickman and Dustin Hoffman.What's the boundary between genius and madness? It's hard to define it, and this movie makes me meditate about that. It's a positively challenging film, which is difficult to be indifferent. Or you like it, or you hate it. Based on Patrick S\u00fcskind's novel, the film knew how to be faithful to it without become predictable for those who haven't read it. The script is good but it's too warm and, despite the suspense, isn't able to create real tension moments before reaching the end, which is explosive and shocking to most impressionable audiences. Perhaps it's because of this that so many professional film critics have been so hard on this film. Okay, it has several flaws, the soundtrack doesn't stand out particularly, the costumes are ordinary despite fulfilling it's role, most of the cast was reasonable but didn't shine... but on the other hand these flaws are compensated by good photograph, the visually attractive scenarios, the correct narrator's diction and, above all, the superb interpretation of Ben Whishaw, who managed to give his character an extraordinary dichotomy of personalities and feelings, which reminded me \"Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\".For all this, and despite being far from perfection, this film is quite acceptable and has some quality moments. After seeing it, I conclude that I will not remember it as one of the best I've seen, but I didn't feel cheated in my expectations."
