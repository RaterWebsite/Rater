It seems to me that this was clearly a rushed project from the casting of sub-par actors to the bland repetitive writing. The most bothersome attribute would probably be the protagonists arch. Not specifically because of Mandy Moore, but because of the way her character never overcame her fear. The one scene that showed some minor redemption to this problem turned out to be a finger to the face in the worst kind of way. That was incredibly disappointing.Another problem that I have been noticing more and more throughout a variety of films is the carelessness of death scenes. This film is no exception! Not to say that death isn't quick in real life, but there is no meaning behind the death, there is no sacrifice for the greater good. Its just there, and its just plain awful. This could be traced back to weak characters, but I would like to think that I can even feel bad for poorly written characters if their deaths are handled properly. The last major problem for me was the unrealistic, or greatly exaggerated physics and science of the movie. These story flaws really took away from any emotion that could have been pulled out of the scenes.(Spoiler Warning)One positive thing about the movie was that the sister did in fact die. They didn't try to bring her back in some stupid half baked way, they actually let a character die. So props for that.Also, the sister bond between the two leads seems real enough.To sum up the tsunami sized mess:If you get your hopes high for this movie, be prepared for them to drop down deep."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Meh.

It does what it sets out to do extremely well:  place its two protagonists (both sympathetic and convincing) in underwater peril and generate considerable suspense via which-way-is-up disorientation, almost-out-of-time maneuvers in tight spaces, and the circling specter of sharks.  It drew me in in a crisp, straightforward, edge-of-your-seat way, even earning a surprising degree of emotional investment by the end, and the underwater photography is frequently gorgeous.

You probably already know that two sisters vacationing in Mexico are convinced to go down in a shark cage.  One sister, Kate (Claire Holt) goes willingly, but older sister Lisa (Mandy Moore) has to be taken kicking and screaming.  Things go terribly wrong when their shark cage cable breaks and they end up on the ocean floor.  It then becomes a terrible case of Murphy's Law - whatever can go wrong, does!  So many things go wrong!  I really \"enjoyed\" this movie, if that is what you call it when you are screaming and hyperventilating.  However, the movie pulls a fast one on the audience (I won't tell you what it is) and I found myself - and probably others - shouting, \"Are you kidding me!!??\"  Anyway, apart from that, I give it good marks.

Unlike a lot of shark films, the majority of the action takes place under the water. The protagonists aren't on a boat (Jaws), floating stranded at surface level (Open Water), or stuck on some rock (The Shallows). They're down deep and with limited visibility. Both concepts are used well, particularly the latter. Kudos to the film for coming up with a reason why these girls can't just book it back to the surface as well. The thing that's going to be the hardest for most people to deal with is the how the characters are handled. The acting from our leads is fine, but the movie falls prey to the old horror trope of barely fleshing them out before hand. It does more than most, but it's still only gives them a little bit of life and backstory before throwing them into the water. We learn that one of them has some boyfriend issues and that's all there is. It's not enough to make viewers truly care about the people at risk. To genuinely give a crap whether or not they make it out alive. Still, it's kind of easy to look past that stuff. Shark movies are about the thrills after all. That's their big appeal. 47 Meters Down has them in spades. The characters race against an ever-dwindling air supply, surprise shark attacks that they literally cannot see coming, and being forced to leave the relative safety of their cage to grab supplies and contact help. It manages to do all of that without ever feeling stupid. Now, I'm sure some suspension of disbelief is going to be required, but unlike so many other films of this nature the people in the most danger actually seem competent given how it is all new territory for them. They're two unprepared people doing the best they can in an entirely unfamiliar scenario. As a result it kept me thoroughly engaged and on the edge of my seat.8.5/10"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "6.8/10  A solid shark thriller with some genuinely well executed suspenseful sequences and a somewhat ambitious ending.

But it's good to see Mandy Moore after a some time. I don't know how much realistic it is, though a decent thriller. Yeah, there are better films on this similar theme, but still this is enjoyable, especially if you are not a regular film goer. There are some fine edgy moments, but it did not maintain that till the last. The end twist was not bad. I truly did not expect that. That does not mean it was awesome. It was okay, works decently for such random films. Well made with production quality. Short runtime as well. So I think it is slightly better than what it has been rated.

The sisters, who are vacationing in Mexico, are confronted with the terrifying reality of being surrounded by large, flesh-eating sharks while their oxygen levels rapidly decline. The movie uses close-ups and the darkness of the ocean to create a sense of claustrophobia and tension. The visuals and music are effectively used to create a sense of dread. The performances by Moore and Holt are solid, but the script is not particularly strong. The relationship between the sisters is cliche and the story has been done before. The movie relies heavily on its visuals, but if the script had been stronger, it would have been more successful. Overall, 47 Meters Down is a thrilling B-movie that effectively uses visuals to create a sense of suspense and danger in the deep sea.____________________47 Meters Down es un thriller de suspenso sobre dos hermanas, Lisa y Kate, que est\u00e1n atrapadas en una jaula de tiburones que ha ca\u00eddo en picado a las profundidades del oc\u00e9ano.
