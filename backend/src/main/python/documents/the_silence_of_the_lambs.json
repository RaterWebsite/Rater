But if something is scary to you, I don't see how you could like it. And yet, this film had scared me like never before and yet I can never let go of the feeling of how amazing it was. The Silence of the Lambs is a crime-suspense thriller, starring Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins. It's about a FBI trainee Clarice Starling, who is assigned to help capture a serial killer by the name of Buffalo Bill.  She simply has to question a former murderer, Hannibal Lector, better known as \"Hannibal the Cannibal\". The FBI believes there might be some sort of connections between the two killers, and asks Clarice to figure out what. And what begins as a small questioning process begins to evolve into one of the greatest crime story ever told. The Silence of the Lambs won 5 Academy Awards, including Best Lead Actor, Best Lead Actress, and Best Picture. It truly deserved all these wins, especially the acting. Jodie Foster's acting as Clarice Starling was great, but what really made this film worthwhile was Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lector. Never have I seen a villain so kind, yet so sinister and evil. Every word and breath he takes is haunting. You know that even when he talks so kindly to Clarice, he has some evil thoughts or something processing in his mind that the viewer can't just understand. That's what makes Anthony Hopkins the best thing about the whole film. Then I believe the second best thing is the cinematography. This film's cinematography is excellent, and done like no other movie before. You see that whenever there's a new character introduced, it's shown in the perspective of the main character\u00e2"

I found myself getting confused about where we were, and then it would all click a few seconds later. It was very clever at making sure you were aware of which character was who.\r The direction is very interesting in this film, with the contrast of the dark and gritty world of the FBI, and what happens when a character is put in prison, but when this then goes against the killer's room, I loved the designs, with all the colours etc.\r But lets face it. We all know why this film works so well.\r Anthony Hopkins. I bow down to you.\r I heard he was only in the film for about 15 minutes. That was a lie. He was just brilliant. The perfect mix of charm and menace to create a truly unforgettable villain. Hannibal Lecter really is the standout of the film, and will have you on the edge of your seat, whenever he is on the screen.\r I think the thing that kept me interested the most here was that it was simply a great story.

      "text": "Absolute cracker of a film. 30 years later and people still talk about this movie. It has never left popular culture still heavily influencing films today and is instantly recognizable from its many references to famous movie quotes. Apart from the really impressive performances by the entire cast (who literally all bring their A-Game), The Silence of the Lambs greatest strength is that it doesn't wallow in depravity, given the nature of the book and the screenplay, wisely choosing to keep a lot of the grisly violence off the screen which makes it even more terrifying. The film is a character study into the minds of two psychopaths and the young rookie cadet trying to match wits with them.The dialog is snappy and sharp and the first part of the film is very procedural and slow moving (although no less absorbing) but once the second half kicks in, with a fantastic bait and switch twist it becomes a rollercoaster ride of pure unnerving tension as the young cadet finds herself alone in a mad man's dungeon trying to save his next victim.I saw the film in theaters and vividly remember people hiding underneath their chairs the films tension was so unbearable in its climax. Of course we have been desensitized in the intervening years since this film released so some may look upon the film today and not understand why it frightened so many people upon release but you have to remember no film from this genre had played cat and mouse with its audience the way this film did back upon release, so it caught everybody off guard.Absolutely brilliant stuff, highly deserving to be in a class of only three films to ever win all five major Academy Awards and easily in my top 5 films of all time."

For me I preferred the scenes with Hannibal in to \"Buffalo Bill\" but Jodie Foster played a good Clarice Starling with excellent chemistry with Lecter. Overall I would give the movie 7/10 but as it was realised in 1991 I can understand why it"

Anthony Hopkins is the main reason this movie is so popular, he has just under 30 minutes screen time and won Best Actor at the 1991 Oscars. Jodie Foster is kind of overshadowed by him, but is also amazing. It is a performance movie, but has a brilliant plot and does not just rely on it's cast to carry the whole thing. Incredibly tense and impeccably performed The Silence of The Lambs is one of my favorite movies ever."

Of course, Hopkins as Hannibal Lector is simply amazing.  He's still the gold standard for the movie villain (even though he's kind of the hero), and I doubt he'll ever be surpassed.  There are so many fascinating, creepy, and even disturbing aspects about the relationship between Starling and Lector, but I'll let you find this out for yourself.  The characters here are as nuanced as I've ever seen.  Foster's performance is also excellent.  I must warn you, it's a graphic, disturbing, and at times even disgusting film, and on a different note some of the technical aspects of the movie haven't aged so well, but all in all, it's so memorable and haunting that I have to call it an absolute horror/crime classic.  I'll admit, I've had nightmares where I was in a building with Hannibal on the loose.  Those were some scary dreams."

      "text": "I think what I love most about Silence of the Lambs is it's filming craft. This movie truly heightens your sense to the maximum degree, you are completely and utterly aware of intentions and brooding desires from both Buffalo Bill and Hannibal, but does it completely succeed in feeding these desires? Not entirely, but in many respects it does. The film clearly has a certain essence of expression to it for it's first pointed to be generic yet surprisingly deep hill-billy antagonist. We can see an almost angering cycle of predator transforming into scavenger and a brief victory of innocence immediately terminated by the film's excellent conclusion which indicates a slightly ambiguous, although intentionally intriguing, return to norm. However, I believe Silence of the Lambs may be a little too intrigued with it's fascinating characters to give them any lore or necessary origin, something I was craving to see from Hannibal but oh my mouth was completely watering to see it from Buffalo Bill. This confused moth man, I was likewise confused whether to feel sympathy or not due to the fantastic Goodbye Horses sequence. Nonetheless, Silence of the lambs is a structural master-class and daringly explores decay in it's natural form although it's complete cocooning whittles away at some earth shattering, pivotal messages the film was aiming for."

Anthony Hopkins is so creepy that just the look of him and his speech make me shiver. I can't believe what goes on in that film, no wonder that I blocked out most of it.\r Anthony Hopkins has such a presence in this film that he stays with you even when he\u2019s not in the scene. He\u2019s in your head the whole time but when you think of it he\u2019s barely in the movie, he just has a few scenes that\u2019s how powerful his performance is.\r The film is so smartly shot, they chose a petite actress, that can easily look frail, and they used some wide shots from above to show how small she is around the Men, and shows how small and inexperience she must feel around them. Jodie Foster played her character with sensitivity and a quiet strength that also elevated the film.\r The Silence of the Lambs is over 20 years old but it holds up, you\u2019re drawn to this suspenseful thriller from the beginning to the end, and then it stays with you. @wornoutspines"

Granted, 1991 was a slow year for movies, and many pundits have remarked that the Oscar field was among the weakest ever (the other contenders were Disney's Beauty and the Beast, Bugsy, JFK, and the overrated The Prince of Tides), but the strong showing of The Silence of the Lambs was a surprise to almost everyone. In the first place, it was released in February 1991, a date thought to be beyond the short memories of the Academy members. Secondly, it is a dark psychological thriller - the kind of movie that occasionally receives a Best Picture nomination, but almost never takes home the statuette.\r Although The Silence of the Lambs is brilliantly constructed and powerfully acted, and became one of the most recognizable thrillers of the '90s, it was neither the best movie of the year (a citation I would award to Beauty and the Beast) nor even the best thriller (overall, Dead Again impressed me more). The Silence of the Lambs contains a number of inarguably great scenes, but the screenplay, adapted from Thomas Harris' novel, suffers from a split personality. The scenes featuring Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) are the stuff of legends. However, the rest of the movie, which concentrates on the pursuit of serial killer Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), has a familiar, derivative feel. In truth, the climax couldn't be more mundane.\r There is little doubt that the most memorable aspect of The Silence of the Lambs is Anthony Hopkins' incomparable performance as Lecter. Taking over for Brian Cox, who was effective, but not especially memorable, as the good doctor in 1986's Manhunter, Hopkins instantly makes the role his own, capturing and conveying the charismatic essence of pure evil. To his dying day, no matter how many roles he plays in the interim, Hopkins will forever be known for this part. (It is a credit to Hopkins' ability as an actor that this part did not result in stereotyping. His post-Silence career has been greatly varied, with roles as widely diverse as a stodgy butler in Merchant-Ivory's The Remains of the Day and an action hero in The Edge.) I can throw out any number of superlatives, but none of them do justice to this chilling performance, which I labeled as the best acting work of the '90s. Want to feel the icy fingers of terror stroke your heart? Watch this mixture of brilliant eloquence and inhuman cruelty. As portrayed by Hopkins, Hannibal is both a suave, cultured gentleman and an unspeakable fiend. He is gracious and monstrous at the same time. (Hopkins also provided one of the most quotable lines in recent film history with \"I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti\", which was followed by an inimitable slithering slurp.)\r It's impossible to mention Clarice without noting that she is one of the rarest commodities in thrillers: a female hero. In interviews, Foster has indicated that, of all the roles she has played in a career that began in childhood, Clarice is her favorite (which makes it odd that she didn't try harder to re-arrange her schedule so she could reprise the part in The Silence of the Lambs' sequel, Hannibal). In addition to having to face Lecter's mind-games and the dangers associated with Buffalo Bill, she must deal with the sexual politics of being a woman in a man's world. The most telling scene occurs early in the movie, when Crawford takes her on a \"field trip\" to view the latest victim. There, in a hick town, she finds herself stripped of authority as a result of a casual comment by Crawford, and surrounded by a group of macho, male cops. After momentarily escaping by taking flight into a memory of her father's funeral, she regroups and takes charge of the situation, ordering the men to clear the room where the body is housed. Thus does Clarice become a woman championing victimized women - a real heroine, not a woman imitating a testosterone-driven stereotype.\r The Silence of the Lambs may not have been the best thriller of the year, but it was the most chilling and creepy, and there's no denying that the most celebrated aspect of the film - the Clarice/Hannibal connection - could not have been accomplished with greater skill."

The Silence of the Lambs is an amazing one, while not my personal favourite of the year of 1991 it was a well deserved Best Picture win in my opinion.Jonathan Demme's direction is superb, the film is shot in a ceaselessly atmospheric manner and Demme never lets the suspense drop. The story from start to finish is enthralling, and the script is tense and thought-provoking.The Silence of the Lambs is wonderfully acted as well. Jodie Foster is the one who holds the film together and her performance here is one of her most excellent, and I mustn't forget Ted Levine who is very chillingly effective as Buffolo Bill. Anthony Hopkins however steals the film, it is his perhaps most iconic character and he proves that although he is in only a portion of the film his performance lives long in the memory.All in all, amazing. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

This unique thriller will keep you hooked from beginning to end. While the film's storyline is near flawless, it's best aspect was the two leads. Jodie Foster shines as the determined trainee. Despite the relatively minimal screen time that he receives, Anthony Hopkins leaves a lasting impression with his performance as the brilliant but maniacal Lecter. Nobody could've nailed those roles better than Foster and Hopkins did; the dynamic between their characters is ultimately what makes this movie as great as it is.

      "text": "With The Silence of the Lambs, Jonathan Demme laid the foundation of all psychological thrillers to come after it and also accomplished a contestant for one of the best book adaptions in film history, as he transformed Thomas Harris\u2019s entertaining and thrilling novel of the same name into a visionary, absorbing, and stereotype-defying motion picture that deservedly ranks among the prestigious trio of films to have won the Big Five categories at the Academy Awards. It\u2019s one of the very few thrillers (not horror films, as asinine Hollywood likes to classify it) that improves with time, similarly to the Chianti Hannibal Lecter mentions in the essential The Silence of the Lambs quote, as it\u2019s neither a whodunit nor a howcatchem, but rather a study of psychopaths\u2019 and serial killers\u2019 twisted states of mind."

Well, me and him watched this together and I could not be more pleased with what this movie had to offer.. Believe me, alot of thriller movies have done a good job emulating this film without trying to exactly copy it. I love the acting, the plot, and the literal thrill of suspense. Im a music guy so I do pay attention to the musical score and lets just say the Munich Symphony Orchestra made me check the curtains and grab an extra layer of sheets.\r Jonathan Demme deserves credit for directing this and so does Ted Tally for writing the screenplay.\rIt's weird but I get the sense that this movie could really happen in real life. I got annoyed at some of the acting but it won best actor and actress so don't take my word for it. Last thing I want to mention is that this movie tackled on some really tough issues like homophobia and sexual orientation. That is BIG considering the 80s was a really rough period for the LGBT community.\r Treat yo self and watch this movie. If the US Library of Congress approves and you don't, you're not appreciating American work. Just kidding but I love a smart, bad-ass villain"

      "text": "In this film, the young and inexperienced FBI Agent Starling will need the help of Hannibal Lecter, a dangerous and manipulative cannibal, to capture a serial killer. Directed by Jonathan Demme, it has screenplay by Ted Tally, and has the participation of Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins. Won five Oscars (Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay; was also nominated for Best Sound and Best Editing).This film needs no introduction and has already become a classic. The Hanibal character is a horror icon and consecrated Hopkins as one of the greatest masters of representation of the late twentieth century. Decidedly, watching this film, we have the notion that all factors combined, in the ideal measure, to make a piece of art that, even so, due to the topic and some more shocking scenes, is not suitable for sensitive people.The script is excellent and works in a masterly manner, without errors or holes. The work of director was essential for the success of the film, along with the performance of the actors themselves. In fact, even the supporting actors in the film were very good in their roles, although the spotlight have been under the heads of Hopkins and Foster. The two actors were brilliant, the way they interact is a drama lesson. The penetrating gaze of Hopkins, and his viperous cynicism, are one of the registered marks of the film. The rest (sets, costumes, photography and soundtrack) is impeccable. It's a great movie, recommended to those who like a suspense story."

The casts, the story, the screenplay were perfect and for a single moment I couldn't even think of something better or something would have been some other way. This is just f**cking mind blowing piece of art directed by Jonathan Demme"

      "text": "All creative hands are at the top of their form in \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs,\u201d a mesmerizing thriller that will grip audiences from first scene to last and generate solid B.O.\r Skillful adaptation of Thomas Harris\u2019 bestseller intelligently wallows in the fascination for aberrant psychology and perverse evil, delivering the goods in a way that should electrify critics and mainstream audiences.\r The specifics of the murder case in question here a serial killer who partially skins his female vlctims  are certainly gruesome, but are handled to generate maximum suspense without descending into the exploitative.\r Thoughtful and not debasing, pic takes a compelling, upfront look at sociopathic behavior and government attempts, with varying success, to keep it in check.\r Faithfully following the essentials of Harris\u2019 book, playwright Ted Tally\u2019s sharp script charts tenacious efforts of young FBI recruit Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) to cope with the appalling challenges of her first case.\r Confounded by a series of grotesque murders committed by someone known only as \u201cBuffalo Bill,\u201d bureau special agent Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) asks his female protege to seek the help of the American prison system\u2019s No.1 resident monster in fashioning a psychological profile of the killer.\r Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) is commonly known as \u201cHannibal the Cannibal\u201d for the antisocial dining habits he took up upon abandoning his career as a brilliant psychiatrist to pursue his calling as a homicidal maniac.\r Astonishingly insightful and brutally frank, Lecter has been kept in a dungeon-like cell for eight years, and while officious doctors and investigators can get nothing out of him, he is willing to play ball with his attractive new inquisitor.\r On a quid pro quo basis, Lecter gives Starling clues as to the killer\u2019s identity in exchange for details about her past. Even though Lecter is known as an ingenious manipulator and Starling has been warned against getting personal with him, she must proceed, especially after the daughter of a U.S. senator becomes Buffalo Bill\u2019s latest captive.\r Just as it seems the noose is tightening around the killer, Lecter, in an remarkably fine suspense Sequence, manages an unthinkable escape. The FBI and, on her own, Starling must use all the info and guts they have to finally corner Buffalo Bill. But then, there is Lecter.\r Harris\u2019 plot is as tight as a coiled rattler, and it has motivated Jonathan Demme to turn out his leanest, meanest work. Abandoning the colorful frills and offbeat mixed moods of \u201cSomething Wild\u201d and \u201cMarried to the Mob,\u201d this always interesting director has devoted himself to relentless storytelling.\r There is not a false note nor an extraneous moment as he establishes a vise-like hold almost immediately and doesn\u2019t let up even through the chilling final shot. In the second half of \u201cSomething Wild,\u201d Demme demonstrated a marked talent for rough suspense, something he sustains for two hours here.\r At the outset, Demme and his longtime ace lenser, Tak Fujimoto, plunge the viewer directly into the p.o.v. of the novice investigator Stariing, as she goes face to face with the diabolical Lecter and, as suggested by the title, is forced to confront her own childhood demons relating to the slaughter of animals. Film is omniscient, however, showing the activities of Buffalo Bill as well as those of Lecter later on.\r In a strong performance, Foster fully registers the inner strength her character must summon up to meet the chaUenges and occasional humiliations her tough assignment entails.\r Cast against type as a reserved man in glasses and a suit, Scott Glenn is a very agreeable surprise as the FBI agent who takes a chance by putting his young charge on the case.\r The juiciest part is Hopkins,\u2019 and he makes the most of it. Helped by some highly dramatic lighting, actor makes the role the personification of brilliant, hypnotic evil, and the screen jolts with electricity whenever he is on. This is, without doubt, his most effective film appearance to date.\r From the huge hall in which Lecter is eerily caged at one point to the dingy rooms of Buffalo Bill\u2019s house, Kristi Zea\u2019s production design is critical to the picture\u2019s mood. Editor Craig McKay keeps doesn\u2019t let a frame stay on too long, and Howard Shore\u2019s rather traditional score outstandingly amplifies the tension and psychological mystery."
