I actually guess that the movie will be nice for those who didn't read the book because it is an avarage movie with action and suspense.... but, man... this is nothing compared to the books. Dashner is a real genius for what he wrote and for the way he wrote it but the movie just ruined the mystery of the book. Through the pages, you learnt together with the Gladers to know the place around you and you came to understand it and eventually you figured out all the secrets of the Maze. This way, the movie lost the magic and transformed everything in a medium quality thing. The characters are wrong (almost all of them but Newt and partly Thomas), the values are wrong, the philosophy that rules the Glade and the Maze is wrong.. not to talk about the riddle to escape...  I will stop here... The movie really sucks if compared to the book."

It makes extensive use of a new device among bad movies/shows: pretending to be interesting by leading you on with mystery, and when it gets to the end you can tell the explanation was haphazardly slapped together after the mysterious elements and not before. It pretends to be smart, but is unaware of how stupid it is. I'm going to go ahead and call this \"Fake Science Fiction\"."

It almost felt like the entire first season of the CW's \"100\" in 2 hours. However, much like many other of YA novel-to-movie flicks, it ends with a massive \"to be continued\" scenario, so you never really get to the guts of what's going on.  Sure, I'll probably see the second one, but this trend in not creating first-installment sci-fi films that can stand on their own  (like the initial Star Wars) is becoming troublesome."

To make matters worse, the ending was nothing more then prepping the audience for a sequel! It was so in your face it was insulting. You mean the audience won't have a clue as to why all those innocent people died unless you come back and waste another 12 dollars! Wow! I will be avoiding any future sequel like the plague!\r The Maze Runner also reflects the sterile and chaste expectations of the American movie going audience. For starters, you have young men living together as a colony for up to as long as three years and they all have perfect haircuts! Give me a break! I couldn't believe how well groomed they all were. Did they have a hair stylist pop in from in from another dimension on a regular basis? And how could they all be so clean shaven? Did they bring razors and shaving cream with them? None of these men have delayed puberty problems that I could tell. LOL! Some of them must have developed facial hair after years of being stranded. But what bothered me most was what great shape their clothes were in. These are young men in there late teens and early 20's. Did they bring a seamstress and a washing machine with them, too!? They are supposed to be living like Robinson Crusoe, not like George Jetson!\r In this entire awful film there was only one single moment of humor. Even worse it has zero sexuality. Here's all these incredibly good looking and physically fit young men and we don't see a single one of them with their shirt off for a second! Why is non-stop violence, intense screaming and even murder is OK, but not showing off the male body? Why have we become such a warped and sterile society where death and violence doesn't offend in the slightest, but God forbid you show a single male nipple or hairy armpit?"

A lot of the time I found myself thinking I was watching a cinematic video game. It was beautiful visually and the story felt like an adventure all the way to the end.\rSome of the characters seemed to be placed there just to drop some one-liners, others had more of a depth. I found myself liking most of them.\rThe story was built up successfully, it wasn't as predictable as other typical \"teenage-movies\" tend to be, and it didn't reveal major plot details immediately but rather left its audience unaware but not confused.\rThat said, it had some oddities and plot holes that I'm sure are explained in the book. From what I heard from my friends who have read it, it was a disappointment story-wise.\rIn conclusion, it is a movie you definitely can enjoy, but if you've read the books - be warned!\rIt is but loosely based on the book. Just be prepared for that and you'll most likely have a good time."

Why they so dramatically changed characters I do not know, but when combined with the mediocre acting, it makes the watcher feel less invested in the characters and almost an indifference to whether or not they make it.\r I am rating this movie higher than my review may sound because as much as I am disappointed in the relation to the book, the movie itself kept me entertained and in suspense and I am looking forward to the next installment."

For me, it had moments of tension, moments of obviously overwrought conflict and moments of action/sci fi potential greatness.  There were far too few of the latter, but enough to keep you in the game.  After Elysium and The Giver (among others), do we really need another evil, manipulative, corporate, blond sleazebag at the center of the controversy?  Could the bad guy be any more simplified and obvious?  As I understand it, the screenwriters actually toned the bad guy down too, which makes one wonder how ridiculous he was in the book.  Do we really need an ending that is 100% about the franchise?  It was so clearly tailored to be the launch of a movie franchise that I actually heard a notable gasp in the theater, which is not a good sign.  The only meaningful female character had no story and no point, other than as a plot device (which could have been accomplished other ways).  They don't even deal with the clear sexual tension of dropping a single young female into a world of adolescent males, which is cowardice.  But, I actually liked the movie. It was, more or less, well paced.  The conflict seemed honest.  The young male actors were pretty good, though it was hard to see the bad guy being portrayed by the kid from \"We're the Millers.\"  The monsters were an interesting combination of organic and technology, but were otherwise unexplained.  At the end, one is left with the notion that this could end up being a good story, but that this is only a limp preamble.  I hope this is the case, as I would like to see what happens next."

The maze itself felt claustrophobic, which added a lot of tension.\rThe only problems I had with this film were the explanations of major plot points and some weird plot twists.

      "text": "It\u2019s the mysterious maze, the acting performances and of course the instinct for survival that makes The Maze Runner epic and one of the best movies of 2014.\r The movie starts with a unique, mysterious and interesting opening scene and we are just as confused as the main actor. There\u2019s not even a single moment where I would define myself as bored while watching The Maze Runner, the whole movie is highly mysterious and you really want to know why things are as they are. Therefor is this movie unique on it\u2019s own way. It\u2019s on the same time scary and highly entertaining, and combined with the soundtrack does it make The Maze Runner truly epic. The action sequences are great, and the characters lives are often in grave danger and that made me on several occasions really nervous. I was therefor totally in the movie, and you really want to know more and you feel like you are in the film.\r The Maze Runner is about survival, curiosity and hope. The story is extremely exciting and the characters are all stunning. The main character \u201cThomas\u201d is wonderful, smart and of course curious. He\u2019s so awesome. There\u2019s also clear chemistry between many of the characters, and I really felt close to them all. The Maze Runner is a very well made film when it comes to CGI, details and depth. The film is greater than what my expectations were, and it repeatedly kept surprise me. The ending is exactly as every movie should be like: mysterious, exciting and spectacular. It makes the audience interested for a continuation. Still, the ending could have been even greater if they hadn\u2019t revealed several aspects of the film. But it\u2019s still a great ending, and yes I know many people might hate it, but I disagree.\r This is an almost flawless film that truly is of the best of the year.\r The Maze Runner gets an 8.2/10."
