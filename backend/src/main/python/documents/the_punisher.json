Other than Daredevil, this would probably the most underrated comic-to-film adaptation I've ever seen. Thomas Jane leads a solid cast and the plot is interesting and complex without losing the audience. Overall, a very enjoyable experience."

It\u2019s a marvel movie that finally allows the main protagonist to take off their PC gloves and give the villains the payback they deserve. It came across as being far more realistic than other movies of this genera. I highly recommend it, and have done to many of my friends, who have also given me good feedback on it."

      "text": "Before the MCU came into being and saved the day, a lot of Marvel characters were having a rough time finding success on the big-screen during the 2000s. Spider-Man and the X-Men were doing fine, and even Blade did well enough to get himself a trilogy. The rest of the Marvel heroes though? Not so much. They were met with poor reviews and disappointed fans. Even The Punisher was met with critical backlash, although for the life of me I can't see why.It's an awesome origin story that plays out as a superhero revenge story. It's dark, brutal, and Thomas Jane absolutely nails it as Frank Castle. There are even some nice bits of dark humor, scenes pulled straight from the comics, and is just as violent as one would expect a Punisher movie to be. Unlike Daredevil it actually manages to nail the mature, gritty tone. Something a lot of superhero movies have struggled with over the years and even still do.It's interesting to see how many familiar faces were pulled from Punisher comics to fill out the supporting cast. The movie offers quite a bit of fan-service for those who are clued in. The mob family Castle sees himself fighting against feels a little generic, and Travolta is surprisingly flat as the main villain, but none of that gets in the way of how satisfying the violence is. It's also got an old-school feel. Revenge has never been quite so satisfying.Yes, the early 2000s weren't the kindest to a lot of Marvel's characters. The critics took shots at The Punisher that honestly feel undeserved. During a time when Daredevil, The Fantastic Four, and even Hulk were failing to do those classic characters justice (they really tried though, I'll give them that), The Punisher stood tall and delivered. It's one heck of a satisfying revenge flick, a bleak vigilante tale, a throwback to the gritty action movies of the 70's and 80's, and something truly different from every other superhero movie out there. It's a treat for fans of the comics and a great action movie for everyone else."

Behind the violence, justified by the actions the mob took against Castle, there is a story. This movie was based on a comic and stays loyal to it. If you're not a fan of the comic or action films, instead of trying to figure out reasons to hate it try and commend what the director and actors have brought forward. This film stays a lot more loyal to the comic than the 1989 film. The atmosphere of the comic is well recreated and and isn't just typical Hollywood bullsh*t."

Frank's motivations for taking revenge are on point but you never feel that it was a big loss for him, they try to compensate that with: \"Look how much he drinks\" and \"Look how dead inside he looks\". He lost his entire family very recently and it looks like all of that happened many years ago or he never cared about them.The motivations for people to help him are very thin, there's all that stuff about family with the people he shares building but there's barely any development between them and Frank.The pacing is bad, it goes to fast, not enough time to develop characters and situations.The writing and dialog are also really low quality.It's sad, because I think Thomas Jane looks great as The Punisher."

      "text": "Firstly I want to say this is another case of the respected critics seeming to not live in the same world as the rest of us. Not everyone will like this movie but rating it so low just tells me that the respect these critics have is not deserved.I really enjoyed this movie. Classic revenge story (sorry, Punishment story), with a bit of unexpected almost goofy humour along with some seemingly intentional tongue in cheek scenes that I very much enjoyed. Plus penty of old west style quick-draws to add to the fun. Captured the essence of a comic book better than most comic book movies. Interestingly John Travolta doesn't stand out as some over the top villian like he usually does in other villian roles. Instead he, and everything else, somehow has a believable realistic feel to it. It makes it more disturbing that he feels like a real person that surely exists in the real world in some form. An interesting balance was achieved in this film between reality and comic book fantasy, as well as seriousness and humour. It all feels more believable than something like Batman Begins, which itself aimed more for realism than past comic movies. The superhero is never really super (though that is true of the comic it is based off of). And there is plenty of luck involved in his success as well as some clever preparation and equipment.I have no real issues with the film. Only really wanting more from it. Wish they'd fleshed out the bad guys wife a bit more since she was a key player. I rate it an 8 but I am up to rewatch it more often than many other movies I'd rate at 9. It does what it does really well.The movie that comes to mind that is most alike to this is \"Payback\" with Mel Gibson \"Payback\" is cooler and grittier but \"Punisher is more fun and with several humourous scenes that always maintain the overall seriousness of the subject matter without ever getting too dark. If you like that film you should enjoy this one and vice-versa."

John Travolta also plays a fine villian in Howard Saint but it doesnt help the character is thinly written to be something more than a cardboard cutout mob boss.As I said, even in 2019 and with Netflix's adaptation being (somewhat) successful this is still a very good movie. It has obvious flaws, especially in the second half but \"The Punisher\" is still a fine film about revenge, punishment, justice and letting go."

The beginning of the film is really intense and it seems like it's going to be one of those, 'it could happen in real life' comic book adaptations. After the first half hour though, that's gone and replaced with the typical unrealistic bull  This film also couldn't decide whether or not it wanted to be PG-13 or R. Ultimately it got the R rating and has the violence that goes with it, but clearly the producers were hoping for the PG-13, and have some really childish parts to it. I hate when that happens, make up your mind! If you're going to be violent and crazy, then go all out, and if not, tone it down and get the PG-13. When they mix both styles, they don't appeal to a larger audience, they appeal to a smaller one. The cast did an adequate job, the story was alright, and the action was pretty cool, but there really isn't much here."

      "text": "PunisherSo this review will be a no-holds-barred spoilerfest because discerning film buffs may have something better to do with their time.1) The first half hour is devoted to Frank Castle the Cop and Frank Castle the Family Man.  I was expecting to see The Punisher.  Maybe I was expecting Blade.  I liked Blade because it started \u201cin media res\u201d with no time wasted and evolved from there.  Everything in the first half hour of Punisher could have been handled in flashbacks lasting a sum total of 5 minutes.  Yeah, it would\u2019ve cut the \u201cemotional content\u201d available to the audience, but, seriously, who watches a film like this for the emotional content?  Fifteen year old girls who think Punisher dude is dishy?2) Frank Castle the Family Man ends with a platoon of bad guys traveling to Puerto Rico to slaughter Frank\u2019s entire extended family.  They approach under full daylight and don\u2019t even bother wearing masks.  There are apparently no people in Puerto Rico except Frank\u2019s kin and the assassins and the assassins shoot up everybody.  Kids and grandmas tumble like toy dolls.  Things explode into roaring fireballs.  Frank is shot at point blank range by one of these \u201cprofessional killers\u201d and is then blown into the Caribbean by an explosion and of course he survives.  I guess the salt water sterilizes the wounds.  Some guy in a rowboat picks him up later.  Maybe some guy from the comic\u2019s origin story.  I didn\u2019t bother looking it up.In the middle of the slaughter Frank looks out a window and sees his mom being gunned down.  His reaction is, \u201cMom?\u201d  Like he either can\u2019t believe his eyes or I don\u2019t know what.  And it\u2019s not like this is Frank\u2019s first rodeo.  The movie starts with a fair bit of shooting.  You\u2019d think the \u201cveteran cop\u201d would instantly risk life and limb to save Mom, or at least spout off with a few raging WTFs!!!!!3) Frank goes on to wreak havoc and exact vengeance.  This part is fairly interesting if you like to see bad guys get what they deserve and you\u2019re not too particular about due process under US law.  Apparently the actual police are all on vacation as they never put in an appearance.4) John Pinette, the late standup comedian, does a nice job in a minor supporting role.  There are several people in minor supporting roles.  For the most part, these roles only distract from the whole point of the film (vengeance) and pad out the runtime.5) The world\u2019s greatest \u201chitman\u201d is called in to kill Frank.  He starts off by carrying a guitar into a diner and singing Frank a song.  I guess this is supposed to imply that the guy is such a great hitman that he can break all the rules and still take down his target.  Naturally, the hitman ends up dead.  Frank takes his car.6) \u201cThe Russian\u201d is called in to kill Frank.  I guess he's #2 in the world.  You know the type.  He\u2019s like seven feet tall and you can smash him in the head with a crowbar and he doesn\u2019t even bleed.  But only in comics and movies.  It turns out he\u2019s vulnerable to burning hot grease in the face.  He dies too.7) There\u2019s a girl in the film.  She\u2019s a bad judge of men. Frank saves her from getting murdered.  That takes about one minute of screen time.  Frank eats the girl\u2019s cooking but keeps his emotional content to himself.8) Overall, Punisher isn\u2019t such a bad film.  It\u2019s just not any better than the typical action-adventure flick being churned out by the hundreds every year.  There\u2019s nothing really clever about the story.  It ends pretty much where you\u2019d expect.If you're a real fan of the comic, you'll probably like it.  If not, maybe you won't.  There are plenty of options that would be far worse."

      "text": "The last real icon created by Marvel Comics, The Punisher began life as a bad-guy variation on Charles Bronson's Death Wish vigilante in the '70s, turned into a grotesque version of a law-and-order hero in the Reagan '80s (even spawning a direct-to-video Dolph Lundgren vehicle), and withered away in the Clinton years. More recently, he experienced a black-comedy revival in the hands of writer Garth Ennis, but the latest film version doesn't have much to do with that. A return to the character's righteous, murdering '80s ways, 2004's The Punisher seems all too of-the-moment now that \"an eye for an eye\" has become national policy.\r Shortly after The Punisher opens, thugs hired by overacting Tampa gang lord John Travolta turn a family reunion into the bloodiest social gathering since Guns N' Roses' \"November Rain\" video. Robbing recently retired undercover FBI officer Frank Castle (Thomas Jane) of his wife, child, father (an apparently eager-to-work Roy Scheider), and a handful of aunts, uncles, and cousins, Travolta's otherwise-thorough henchmen only stop short of making sure that the man himself has died. When he resurfaces, Jane returns to Tampa to exact revenge.\r And that's the movie, a revenge scenario so simple it could have been created on a playground. In the right hands, it might have worked: John Woo could have turned it into a bullet-drenched melodrama, some kind of crazy variation on In The Bedroom. With Kill Bill, Quentin Tarantino turns a similar scenario into a meditation on honor, justice, and a century of different styles of cinematic violence. Sadly, The Punisher is about little more than bullets hitting bone, and how good it might feel to be on the right end of a gun.\r Armageddon screenwriter turned first-time director Jonathan Hensleigh displays a lot of enthusiasm for stormy lighting, as well as a fashion photographer's skill at putting his actors in memorable poses, but the whole show is watching Jane mow down the bad guys, taking the occasional breather to hang out with new friends Rebecca Romijn-Stamos and her misfit hangers-on, and to drown his sorrows in a bottle of Wild Turkey. (The brand is featured so prominently that it must be product placement, but is \"the drink of choice for bloodthirsty gunmen\" a desirable tagline?) There's not even a hint of suspense over the outcome; Jane is portrayed as such an unstoppable machine that only professional wrestler Kevin Nash is made to look like a formidable adversary.\r The Punisher has one inspired sequence. Wearing a teardrop tattoo, a Memphis hit man serenades Jane before attempting to kill him. The scene lasts about a minute. The movie goes on much longer."

There was a lot of good action scenes as well. However the dialouge between characters was incredibly poor at times and rather disapointing. Still, I have watched it numerous times and I still enjoy it."
