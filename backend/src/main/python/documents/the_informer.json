      "text": "Joel Kinnaman plays the titular character, who\u2019s undercover to help the FBI bring down a Polish drug operation. As expected, things go wrong almost immediately and he spends the rest of the movie fighting for his life and innocence.  Rosamund Pike and Clive Owen are also in the cast, but it\u2019s really Kennaman\u2019s show. He makes a solid tough guy with an edge of brains. The film itself unfolds with predictable developments, so it\u2019s more about the character extricating himself out of this predicament, than any strong action beats. Solid drama, but not special, although it does bode well for Kennaman\u2019s future action hero status."

      "rating": "5",
      "text": "A disappointment, despite a promising beginning and an intense, spot-on performance by Kinnamon. The rest of an excellent cast is wasted, especially Pike and Owen (whose one nite nastiness veers to the ridiculous.) But the film\u2019s main problem is its increasing implausibility as it moves along, and its incoherence. Characters and plot lines are introduced, and then abandoned never to be seen again. An interesting character of a female NY defective is introduced early, goes off to a date, and disappears. That\u2019s just one example. A mess, which is too bad given the promising start and Kinnamon\u2019s performance."

      "text": "Maybe not perfect but when I just read someone\u2019s opinion with bad score, that the plot was predictable I laughed hard and had to write a short review.  Many surprising plot twists in this movie. Keeps you entertained from beginning to the end."
