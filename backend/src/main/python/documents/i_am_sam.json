It is true what Chicago Sun-times wrote that every device of the movie is designed is to convince us Lucy must stay with Sam even though common sense makes it impossible to go the distance with the premise, but this doesn't make it a bad movie. I would recommend it to anybody who looks for a touching movie, which also makes you laugh sometimes."

      "text": "I don't understand why this movie received such terrible reviews from the critics, because it is one of the best film I have seen ever. Period. A film involving a true ethical dilemma. It hard not to get emotionally involved with the film. Sean Penn is amazing in the lead role, which if it had have been released a different it likely would have won him an Oscar (Penn lost the 2002 to Denzel Washington for his role in Training Day, which is hard to object). Michelle Pfeiffer was also great in her role as she develops more and more throughout the film. Sam is a character that is as lovable as any character could ever be. His meetings with his friends are great scenes to watch, they are very cute."

      "text": "claiming the title of being an actor..I Am SamI Am Sam is a plot driven family drama about a mentally handicapped father whose daughter is considered to be taken into a foster home. Armed with such potential and considerably explored by the filmmakers in many ways, it offers expectations with such huge cast. As much as honest and pathos its ideology is, the methods that it adapts to draw in the emotions out from the viewers is pure manipulation. The plot track wanders in without any whatsoever connection or logic and visits pointless places for more than two hours. As it ages on screen, there is neither sincerity, mannerism and maturity in script to breed any aspects of the feature appropriately. The screenplay is so naive and inedible that viewers cringe on seat as the makers attempt to attain a closure of their self-created destructive bubble. The primary reason why it doesn't work is its futile constant knack for drawing out a chuckle and its shallow script that it surfs through the entire feature. Penn's riveting performance is genuinely moving, to a point where it carries off the entire tale on merit and makes it worth surviving for the viewers. As much as brilliant Penn is, Pfeiffer couldn't be more distracted whilst Fanning shows some promising skills. The background score is pointless with immature camera work and daft and questionable cinematography. The screenwriter and director Nelson not only possess sloppy writing skills with incoherent forcibly imputed sequences but also lacks execution skills which is demoted by its confused camera work. Penn is the only high point of the feature as it elevates the momentum as much as he can. I Am Sam is Penn claiming the title of being an actor, and it aches to encounter such a talent go waste by on something so fatuous."

      "text": "This is a sad, poignant and thought provoking watch. Seann Penn gives a great performance as the titular character. I imagine a film such as this will have brought a lot of controversy at the time it came out, due to the actor not having a related mental/emotional disability as portrayed in the film but I did feel the sensitive subject areas covered were treated with respect. I thought this was quite a memorable film, although it is a bit hard to watch at times, again due to the films themes. It also features a nice soundtrack, with most of the songs performed having been written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney and are sung by Sarah McLachlan, Sheryl Crow etc. This film is well worth a watch for the depiction of how vulnerable people are treated in modern American society and highlights compassion at times (which isn't to say everything goes perfectly, certainly not), if nothing else, so I would definitely recommend it, even though having some tissues to hand may be an idea if your prone to crying when watching emotional films!."
