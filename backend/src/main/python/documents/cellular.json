Cellular resembles that superior 1993 thriller right down to the same locations. (If I see one more shootout on that damn pier.) Cellular however is strangely mixed with a collection of those only in Los Angeles crackpots similar to those found in everything from Volcano to Out in Fifty.\r The resulting mismatch of tones is one part thriller (Kim Basinger trapped in an attic) one part Speed (Chris Evans driving around L.A.) and one part Randy Newman video.\r Credibility (usually important to a thriller) is thrown out early with great force. Kim Basinger shows her kid of to a private Los Angeles Academy (she is a science teacher but surprisingly not at work herself) walks back to her Brentwood home (I'm guessing 2.5 million) greets her live in maid and is quickly kidnapped. The kidnappers drive off with her in her own Porsche minivan. So when the first thing she says to our hero Chris Evans is \"I don't know why they kidnapped me. We aren't rich. I'm just a school teacher?\"\r Well needless to say Sigourney Weaver's upper west side apartment in Ghostbusters had more credibility. The \"it\" the kidnappers are after is even sillier. Without giving too much away one wonders why the husband didn't turn \"it\" into the nearest TV station.\r The villains themselves are right out of a rejected script for The Shield. The movie has enough action that works to be entertaining for stretches and Kim Basinger does a commendable job with a strangely written role. (Besides her I'm not rich howler she is also saddled with a monologue, right out of the talking killer handbook, where instead of running away after stabbing a man she explains at some length how as a science teacher she knew exactly which artery to cut.)\r Lackluster villains, a constantly changing tone, and contrived credibility sink the film at the end however. Sadly if my High School teacher looked like Kim Basinger and the curriculum consisted of how to steal phone service and stab people (not to mention live like a millionaire on a teachers salary) I probably would have ended up at MIT rather than some party school named after a drugstore."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "there is  novelty in the story. there is less originality as it seemed nothing new. execution is good. it was enthralling and captivating. direction screenplay and technical values are good. casting and production values are also good. overall the movie has missed somewhere in the middle to become a trade mark movie. but it is engaging and worthy to have a watch."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "De la part de David R.

Its the whole stereotype of the helpless blonde weepy woman depending on a young man to be her hero and to save her, ugh, that did seem pretty cheesy and sexist in a way. I kept thinking surely she could find a way out of there or do something more to get out, although, story wise, I thought it was quite good with the whole idea about it all depending on him keeping the phone call going, the call being the only means of contact, that I thought was an interesting idea, that hasn't been done all that much in movies, that im aware of anyway.This is a film im sure guys will enjoy, possibly to the annoyance of their girlfriends if such kind of stereotypes or somewhat formulaic movies irk them.It isn't a particularly long movie, at just over an hour and a half, which is good in a way as it doesn't drag too much, especially once the first hour is over and it becomes quite action packed, it doesn't drag on for too long, like some such movies can.Knowing that Jason Statham is in this movie should be clue enough, I suppose, as to what its like and that its quite a male oriented action film.I wasn't sure whether to give this a 3 or 4 star rating at first, but I think as such a movie, it is quite good, its pretty thrilling at times and has some good car chase scenes and it is quite entertaining, so in that respect it is a good movie, hence my rating.Yes I would recommend this. Its been shown on Film 4 (I taped it from that channel) and hopefully they'll repeat it again, so you may be able to see it for free and for free, its certainly worth watching. It may be a little cheesy or sexist in a way but as an action film, it is quite exciting and so I think it is worth seeing. I don't know that I'd say its worth paying a great deal for on DVD but if you can rent it or catch it on TV for free, then I would recommend it, for the car chase scenes and the fact that it does hot up towards the end. Oh and there is a little bit of comedy/humour with the cop played by William H. Macy and what happens with him visiting a health spa and then spotting on TV what has happened, that was quite amusing."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "+\u00f7+\u00f7+\u00f7+\u00f7+\u00f7+\u00f7+\u00f7+\u00f7+\u00f7+\u00f7\u00f7++\u00f7+\u00f7+\u00f7+\u00f7+\u00f7+\u00f7+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*\u2606\u00a1\u2606\u00a1\u2606\u00a1\u2606\u00a1\u2606\u00a1\u2606\u00a1\u2606\u00a1\u2606\u00a1\u2606\u00a1\u2606\u00a1\u2299\u00a1\u2299\u00a1\u2299\u00a1\u2299\u00a1\u2299\u00a1\u2299\u00a1\u2299\u00a1\u2299\u00a1\u2299\u00a1\u2299\u00a1\u2299\u00a1\u2299"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "\u25cf\u2299\u25cf\u2299\u25cf\u2299\u25cf\u2299\u25cf\u2299\u25cf\u2299\u25cf\u2299\u25cf\u2299\u25cf\u2299\u25cf\u2299\u25a0\u2299\u25a0\u2299\u25a0\u2299+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+\u2606\u00a1\u2606\u00a1\u2606\u00a1\u2606\u00a1\u2606\u00a1\u2606\u00a1\u2606\u00a1\u2606\u00a1\u2606\u00a1\u2606\u00a1\u2606"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "An exhilarating thrill ride!Awesome flick!

The parts that weren't so believable were very satisfying and the parts that were believable were incredibly suspenseful. The point is, the whole thing made for a terrific package.
