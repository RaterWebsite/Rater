And then everything descends into cliched tropes, deviating from any kind of reality, culminating in a final act which is as predictable as it is irritating. Winslet and Elba give solid performances that are sadly hampered by a mediocre script, and ultimately they aren't enough to redeem this sanitised, lacklustre film. 5.31/10"

Having read a few, I can only say the issues others seem to have had upon seeing \"The Mountain Between Us\" were, for the most part high points for me. I thought the entire story, the acting, the plot - and especially the pace and arc of the story/characters - were, in a word, perfect. Not a perfect movie, but neither was this a case of \"good for what it is\" movie either (like some of the guilty pleasure movies I've enjoyed for purely escapist value). I found that depth, substance and authenticity pushed \"The Mountain Between Us\" so far beyond the vast majority of pictures with similar descriptions/trailers that it at once satisfies, defies and elevates the so-called survival thriller genre."

If I say it was predictable I wouldn't mean it as a bad thing. Not at all. I don't care if it was predictable, because it was also captivating and I was watching it carefully. And it was interesting to me. The both characters were played brilliantly and that's why the film felt so veritable. Cinematographically, visually 'The moutain between us' is magnificent. And the great thing is that the end was stunning. We all know how hard is to make the end being good and to match the movie. Here we see amazing end, which leaves you without words, with a big smile on the face. The whole love story was authentic for which good directing and good acting play contributed. I really don't get why people expect only drama, bad things happening and sad ending .The things I would recommend is the duration, may be I would have put a little bit more sounds and music, but not much, because that would destroy the authentic sense . I love this movie. It is well done and it did it's job to effect."

The first half features some gripping moments of danger and bleak desperation, but that tension dissipates when their relationship starts to dominate the plot. With lesser actors in the roles, it might have been a sappy disaster, but these 2 have the chops to bring courage and conflict. Even with some predictable twists, this starts promisingly as a riveting survival story. However, the second half can't sustain the tension and loses some of the emotional impact."

      "text": "Two strangers must work together in order to survive after a plane crash leaves them in the middle of a remote, snow-covered mountain. I wasn't expecting greatness by any means, it's a generic story but so badly executed it's painful to watch. Hard to believe this is Kate Winslet and Idris Elba. I'm still in shock at just how bad they are in The Mountain Between Us. In fact it's hard to believe anything that goes on in this apparent \"survival\" movie.From the opening plane crash onwards you don't believe anything these characters are doing. Nothing they ever say seems natural. Laughable on more than one occasion. But perhaps the most unexpected thing about The Mountain Between Us isn't the dreadful acting and the cringe worthy script. No it's the fact that it features one of the funniest movie plane crash sequences I have ever seen, coming in at a close second after The Mummy. A plane crash shouldn't be funny but somehow The Mountain Between Us achieved that. So bland and unimaginative, no scene has a smooth transition into the next, it quickly cuts again and again to the point where it seems it only takes Idris Elba a couple of minutes to hike up to the top of a mountain and back down again like it was nothing. I'm sorry did I miss something? Maybe I dozed off at some point? But don't worry if you do because Kate Winslet will help you with some plotsplaining. Thanks Kate, you're so considerate to take the time to inform us the audience it's been three days since you've been lost or it's been three weeks etc. Well it's amazing that for three weeks lost in the wilderness Kate and Idris look pretty much the exact same the entire time. Well maintained beard, perfect hair and not a shred of weight loss for people who are supposedly starving. A survival movie? You wouldn't know it. There are people who come home after a weekend at Oxygen looking more haggard than these two. They're never in any real danger so when they're out in these \"dangerous\" situations you're not on the edge of your seat. You're not sitting in suspense, you're bored. And wow did the boredom continue. I did consider walking out, not something I usually do but I definitely considered it. Yet I've watched this much already I have to finish it, so was it worth it? No. I should have left.The Mountain Between Us tried so hard to make me care about these characters. Adding unsurprising details of back story in a desperate attempt to make me understand and care about poor Kate and Idris lost in the wilderness but it failed spectacularly. It's not often you're rooting for the main characters to die in a survival movie but this achieved that no problem. Not recommended, do not waste your time on this absolute rubbish. Better yet watch an episode of Bear Grylls instead."

      "text": "The story of a sweet, widowed British brain surgeon who ends up having to tolerate a pushy, neurotic American woman photo-journalist through a wilderness survival ordeal that begins as a plane crash. The radical oxytocin bonding that evolves between them, as the outcome of their intense, traumatic 3-week struggle, is then mistaken by both of them to be some form of irresistible 'love', when no man in his un-oxytocin-altered mind could even like such a neurotic b*tch. Whoever wrote, produced and/or directed this utter waste of time should be arrested, forced to pay back the 35 million dollars it cost to make the film and then later invited to study plumbing or some other form of manual labor. Kate Winslet is at her absolute worst. There is ZERO chemistry between these two. Ironically, SHE'S trying to teach HIM the value of following your instincts over logic, when every instinct she has, and that he follows through with and has to rescue her from, ends up being a total disaster, especially for him."

The hero and heroine meet \u2018cute\u2019 while Kate Winslet and Idris Elba have the chemistry that couple needs. The photography by Mandy Walker of the British Columbia mountains is a standout while Dog, played by two dogs, almost steals the picture from the co-stars.I am a sucker for a love story but when it fails to move you the blame squarely is in the hands of the screenwriters and in this case they are Chris Weitz and J. Mills Goodloe and the director Hany Abu-Assad. While these three throw in a load of calculated missteps and things just seem to happen at the opportune time they are saved by the stars---and the dog.Kate Winslet and Idris Elba make the characters rise above the clich\u00e9s and, almost, make the movie worth seeing even if they, and they alone, make the lovers believable with both having charm to spare.\u201cThe Mountain Between Us\u201d is a basic love story with a twist but even at 105 minutes seems a bit too long and with another cast would have been a complete waste."

And at the showing I attended (which had many more people than I expected \u2013 all silent and attentive), someone applauded at the end \u2013 too bad I didn\u2019t have the guts to join him/her. No, the film was not perfect, but it was absorbing, partly because Elba and Winslet were completely believable. I didn\u2019t doubt for a minute that they were on the mountain, although I must admit I figured they would get off eventually \u2013 and they did keep getting saved from freezing by one thing or another. I would recommend this film, although maybe not to the fan boys at Blade Runner 2049, which I saw the previous day. I must admit I liked The Mountain Between Us a lot better. It certainly was far more believable than Blade Runner 2049 \u2013 and I found the original Blade Runner completely believable."

But when the credits appeared, I realized that I was wrong, this movie was based on a book, after that, my opinion of the movie was another. Kate Winslet and Idris Elba, they\u00b4re both very likeable actors, and that\u00b4s the only reason of why we\u00b4re interested in what they do on screen, but, if the actors were other people, we would be extremely bored. There are some things that do not make sense, some long scenes and unnecessary scenes. I believe the romance between the two leads though, but again, it was because of the actors. The photography and looks of the movie are great, I felt cold during the movie. In the end, The mountain between us it\u00b4s not a remarkable movie, not worthy of your money if you are looking for a good movie, but if you have nothing to do, you can check it out; because overall, it\u00b4s not boring."

      "text": "The dog was awesome, otherwise...Massively disappointing movie, the director really messed this up: two great stars, what should have been built in drama (mountains! plane crash! blizzard!) and turned it into essentially a parody of an outdoor adventure/romance. (I couldn't help but snicker around about the 49th time Kate grimaced and dragged her leg across the tundra.) I'm a huge fan of Idris & Kate -- but even their talents couldn't transcend the clunky directing. Long stretches of nothing happening, camera dwelling on a static scene as if it's supposed to mean something. Virtually no thrills in what should have been a gripping tale. Most of the time it seemed as if the director had no clue what to do with the story & gave up, fade to black, everything just hanging there. Because this is my favorite genre (outdoor survival) & two of my favorite actors, I guess I'll give this a five. OTOH, I should give it a 1 because it was such a let down & pretty much a travesty by the time you get to the final cliche."

      "text": "The advertising would suggest that this is a survival thriller. Two strangers having to work together in order to survive after a plane crash and they face epic challenges along the way. At least the trailer would make you think that was what the movie was about. Instead, the movie is actually a badly directed romance disguised as a survival thriller. Both of the main characters fall in love during the journey and it\u2019s all just awkward. The dialogue is pretty bad, there\u2019s odd pauses when Elba and Winslet talk, the pacing is really slow, and the last 20 minutes are completely unnecessary. Not to mention that the story becomes really predictable. It\u2019s all a shame because Idris Elba and Kate Winslet are talented actors. They try their best, but it can\u2019t save this movie. Some action sequences (like the plane crash) and camerawork are well-done, but the predictable story and terrible directing bring it all down. Essentially, this is a big budget Hallmark Channel movie disguised as a survival thriller. If you like those kind of movies, you\u2019ll enjoy this. But as for me, this was a bad movie."

The big problem is that the writing makes Kate Winslet completely dependent on Idris Elba to live! The film stumbles because one character isn't played to the height of their intelligence, which isn't interesting to watch. There were many one-liners where I rolled my eyes and groaned. If these re forgivable for you or even entertaining, Mountain Between Us is the movie for you. Not for me: I like it when all the characters are smart."

The I think the Idris Elba's and Kate's performance is one of the three thing it's done properly. They delivered the emotions of their characters over to the audience  and it really felt more powerful. The script writing and character writing was as basic as it get's on an adventure movie. The second thing that was really done great where the visuals. Respect for really shooting in practical effects and not blue screen. The pacing issues are aching for attention as the movie unfolds and after the first 15 minutes it becomes painfully repetitive and a chore to watch. The plot was lacking ....everything, or rather anything. It felt so shallow that even at the end it felt that this idea was by far not enough to make a movie on. I have better ideas for movies, which gives you to think about it. The way it was delivered, this simple and shallow plot was delivered in an already seen fashion. Also it was super cheesy and on average the general audience will not be able to take the ending seriously. It's so cliche that it hurts even the actor's performance. The cinematography was the third properly done thing, but sadly the last one. Any other aspect of this movie is just utterly bad.Overall the movie has no message and it can't even be considered action, because there was none. It's movie that was no supposed to be made to a movie, because it was lacking so much plot, and these 3 thing are the elements that save the movie from being a very bad one, and just barely making it pass as a below average one."
