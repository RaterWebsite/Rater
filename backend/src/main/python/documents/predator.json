But with Arnold Swachenegger in it was more action than horror. Doesn't matter, it all tied up when Arnold was being hunted by the PREDATOR. The universes best hunter ever, until it met Arnold. They both gave each other hell. Arnold gave the predator hell because he was sent in the middle of the jungle to help a team distress call. But instead he and his team find nothing but skinned soldiers and of course the predator. The PREDATOR gave him hell because its his right of passage to become a \"man\". All together the movie was awesome. Not the best graphics you ever saw but still what a movie. Thumbs up."

After all these years its obvious - this is and will always be remembered as brilliant cult classic! 10 out of 10."

Arnold ends up defeating it but by surprise he didn't kill it in the end, the predator kills itself when it saw no other way to win. this movie is so awesome that it makes me wish they left it alone and didn't make many sequels, having said that I am looking forward to The Predator this year which i will review after i see it."

      "text": "Predator is a thrilling, science-fiction action film, that stars the incomparable action star Arnold Schwarzenegger. Released in 1987, Predator has gone one to be one of the most widely-recognised sci-fi's of all-time. A team of highly-professional soldiers get dropped off by helicopters in which seems to be an easy mission dealing with guerillas. They're there to take them out but little do the realise the'll be getting picked out, one by-one by an Alien Warrior that's ship had crash-landed in the central-american jungle. Alan \"Dutch\" Schaefer played by Arnold Schwarzenegger leads the team of soldiers.\r This film's unmatchable in every way and still remains the greatest of all three solo Predator films and is far better than both Alien vs Predator films too. Schwarzenegger is the greatest and also, for the add, BIGGEST action star of all-time, so he really makes this film what it is. I love it in every way. The incredible shoot-locations, pretty awesome dialogue, Science-Fiction, violence, plot and more. It's all great. I rate Predator a 10/10 as it's my all-time favourite film. I love so many films, but Predator is definitely my favourite (alongside a few other, non-related films).\r A+, 10/10."

      "text": "More than just another dumb '80s Schwarzenegger actioner, Predator has gradually become a sci-fi and action classic. It's not difficult to see why. John McTiernan's direction is claustrophobic, fluid and assured, staging the action with aplomb but concentrating just as much on tension and atmosphere.\r It's cheesy as hell, of course, but enormously entertaining and deeply cool, with a ton of quotable lines - 'I ain\u00edt got time to bleed' - while The Predator itself is an utterly unforgettable villain. But most bad guys are only as good as their heroes and, long before he became a shambling self-parody, Arnie delivers - and not just in the walking and talking without falling over sense. He's an awesomely indestructible figure here, at the height of his physical powers. He's the archetypal immovable force meeting an irresistible object. Only Arnie at his most iconic could convincingly defeat the Predator (as those who've seen Danny Glover in 'Predator 2' know).\r There's also something ironic in the climax, where immigrant Arnie - now fully embraced by the U.S. - kicks the tar out of a real illegal alien. We could go into the sexual subtext, but maybe we're just reading too much into it.\r A thumping piece of powerhouse cinema."
