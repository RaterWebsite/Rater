This time the group are just so stupid, wasting countless lives without even fighting any enemies. Then there's the Character switches. Jack Black playing an African American is just a bit lame and he has like no decent lines in this film. They should have kept the roles the same. Saying that, Kevin Hart really carries this film with his performance as Denzil Washington. His lines are all amazing. Ok, so why are the group like superheroes now?

The sequel from 2017 is not good but the 2019 sequel is slightly better than it. This film has basically the same plot as the original although it does differentiate in a few places but its repetitiveness leads the film to be predictable. I was able to predict what was going to happen before each \u201clevel\u201d. Since I felt it was predictable, I did get bored during some sequences. The film has a noticeable lack of tension due to its repetitiveness and predictability. I knew the characters would be fine and make it out of each situation okay. The script is nothing too good either. It isn\u2019t terrible but I felt it lacked a little bit of charm and caused some of the jokes to feel a little forced although a handful of jokes got a smile or chuckle out of me. The video game characters played by Dwayne Johnson, Karen Gillan, Jack Black, and Kevin Hart did a pretty good job. In the first film, they had to impersonate only one character but in this film they had to impersonate two or three and I felt they did a great job at that. In the first film, I felt Jack Black was the only funny character but in this one Jack Black and Kevin Hart were the funniest ones. Gillan and Johnson were able to get a laugh out of me though in a couple of areas. Unfortunately, the acting from the real life characters, besides Danny DeVito and Danny Glover, was not so great. They do not have any chemistry together and just felt awkward around each other. The action set pieces are new and unique in some areas but similar and repetitive in others. They were entertaining yet a little boring at the same time. Some of the technical aspects are just okay. The music is bland and boring but the cinematography is serviceable. The visual effects were mostly below average in the first one but they were better here although very shotty in a few areas.

Pick your avatar! Hold on\u2026 I accidentally got sucked into the game for a second. Hey everyone, welcome back to Stream To Big Screen. This weekend we were able to review Jumanji: The Next Level. This is the sequel to Jumanji: Welcome To the Jungle from 2017. This movie again stars Jack Black, Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart. This time they welcome a few new old timers to the series Danny DeVito, Danny Glover, and Rory McCann (the Hound).On Level 1, we must discover the plot. If you saw the first one, then you pretty much will get this movie. Basically, the film brings together a ragtag group of individuals who think they know who they are but this game will ultimately help them find out more about themselves. It happened in the first one, and it happens again here. That\u2019s not why you come to this movie.*loses a life*On Level 2, you come to this movie to be entertained, pure and simple. The Rock and Kevin Hart work together quite well. Unfortunately, here they don\u2019t get to play off of each other as much as I\u2019d like, but they still give some gems. Do not get me wrong, my viewing neighbor and I were cracking up throughout the movie, but at times the jokes got old. Honestly, just thinking about Kevin Hart doing an impression of Danny Glover and Dwayne doing his impression of Danny DeVito\u2019s character was quite hilarious; however, by the end of the movie the old people jokes have worn out their welcome.The movie just felt too long \u2013 partly because they overused the same jokes.*loses a life* There were a few lulls throughout the movie, but in the times of action or comedy the movie does a good job of keeping you entertained. And, the direction of the action is good enough to make the audience feel as if they are really in a video game, which makes up for some of the lulls in the movie.Final level of this review, Jumanji: The Next Level is a fun family friendly movie. There are laughs for the old folks and the young. If you liked the Jumanji from 2017 you will like this one.

Especially one that looked like it wasn't going to be much more than a cash-grabbing retread of the original. While it is certainly familiar, The Next Level is actually a minor improvement on its predecessor with everybody's shtick being a bit funnier this time around. Watching Hart and Johnson play old men never gets old, Jack Black proves once again to be one the best character actors out there right now, and Awkwafina almost gives him a run for his money with her dual performance. Even Karen Gillan who is largely stuck in the same role as last time gets a brief moment to embody a different persona, which she does impressively.The action set-pieces are also more exciting and memorable. While I'll only ever remember Welcome to the Jungle for its jokes, sequences here like the one where the cast dodge mandrills while jumping across moving rope bridges will stick in my mind just as strongly as any of the laughs. The themes of friendship and self-acceptance play out noticeably sweeter as well.The flaws are the same as before. Namely, not every gag or one-liner landing and it being kind of hard to pinpoint the target audience as far as age range goes. The comedy still varies wildly in terms of maturity. There are some moments clearly aimed at young children and others where the humor is so raunchy it seems only acceptable for older teenagers and adults. Because of this it kind of falls into a weird area where it's not going to be the most appropriate or comfortable choice for everyone's family movie night.Yet, I can't deny that it's a lot of fun. It never tries to go bigger than the 2017's Jumanji. Instead it introduces a few amusing new twists and some subtle refinements while saving the big changes for what looks to be a pretty interesting third (technically fourth) chapter. It's a better sequel because of that.7.9/10"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "I came to this movie with somewhat low expectations. I watched the previous entry, and while entertaining, and clever, it didn't leave me with a lasting impression. I expected an average experience.However, Jumanji: The Next Level really took the ideas and characters of the previous film to the next level. Rather than taking the easy route, and introducing new characters, the four original protagonists return, and their relationships had evolved prior to the plot. This requires to both portray new complications, and new dynamics between them. Kudos to the writers for that.Danny DeVito and Danny Glover proved to be an excellent addition. The interactions they provide - both in real life, and in the world of Jumanji - are rich, and humorous. I liked the display of the generation gap, when it comes to video games, and how the two adapted to concepts that were previously very foreign to them.All the actors perform well in this film, and seem comfortable in their roles. Their fun translates to an overall fun experience for the viewer as well.For me, one scene stood out above the others. It includes a perilous situation involving rope bridges and numerous angry primates. It reminded me of a similar scene in The Hobbit, where the heroes were in no real risk, and the horde of enemies provided no actual threat; no decisions based on character personality were made, and the whole thing was reduced to a perfectly timed CGI dance. Jumanji chose to provide much more than eye candy that fits a video game cut-scene, and again kudos to the writers.This review turned out longer than I intended, so here's the short version: go watch it!"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I actually liked The Next Level better than the previous installment in this franchise.

With that in mind, Jumanji the Next Level is not trying to be an Oscar worthy exploration of the median of film making, nor should it be. It is self aware in its goofiness and frequently leans into it. When the previous Jumanji movie came out I was pleasantly surprised by how entertaining it was. I wouldn\u2019t say this film feels quite as fresh as its predecessor, since it relies on a number of similar jokes, however for the most part, the film was entertaining, and got some genuine laughs out of me. All the actors are clearly having fun with the roles, and that fun is infectious. Likewise there is solid on screen chemistry. I do worry that the continuation of this franchise could see it tire out very quickly and since the film does hint at a sequel (combined with Hollywood\u2019s obsessions with flogging franchises of every penny possible) it wouldn\u2019t surprise me to see another. We will have to see then whether my fears were justified.However for now, this is a bit of fun that is well made for the most part and worth the price of admission even if it is just an exercise in switching your brain off for a couple of hours. There is nothing wrong with that either, life and the world are too dark to not have room for some silly entertainment sometimes.7/10 Silly, Goofy Fun - primarily aimed at a younger audience."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "better than I expected, the higher rating professional reviews get it right"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "The sequel is again a masterwork for playing with stereotypes, cliches and tropes of video games and movies. They added Danny deVito and Danny Clover to the mix. Both are very good actors and are a fine addition of the already great cast. Then there is Awkwafina. While she had not as much screen time as the other delivered an awesome performance. Like in the prequel all characters are inside other characters as avatars. But now the roles are switched which is hilarious funny. Imagine the old man Danny deVito inside Dwanye Johnson body or in Awkwafinas. I will praise again the whole team and actors for this movie. You can see the fun they had during filming and are delivering the other characters personalities close to perfection. There is no out of character moment or misstep in this category. All jokes are working very well. We were entertained and did not stop laughing for a while. My only complaint are the first 20 minutes. They need a bit of time for the set up to get the story started. Maybe this is not a valid critic because we want more Jumanji and not a set up. However the later parts are more than enough to balance this out. Overall the title \u201cThe Next Level\u201d is a fitting description for this movie. More of the same with added content and improvements. They keep the strengths and added new actors, abilities and lore."}], "recommendations": ["jumanji_welcome_to_the_jungle", "deadpool_2", "shazam_fury_of_the_gods", "pitch_perfect_2", "logan_lucky", "tag", "zombieland_double_tap", "ghostbusters_ii", "thor_ragnarok", "the_a_team", "deadpool", "the_losers", "night_at_the_museum_battle_of_the_smithsonian", "kingsman_the_golden_circle", "rocknrolla", "the_green_hornet", "minions", "baywatch", "thor_love_and_thunder", "spenser_confidential", "horrible_bosses_2", "guardians_of_the_galaxy", "hancock", "night_at_the_museum_secret_of_the_tomb", "pitch_perfect_3"]}
