Four stranded yet carefree teens are taken in by a backwoods family, clueless of their host family's grisly habits. The terrified youths, including sweet Jenny, try to escape from Leatherface and his crazed clan, including the bionic Vilmer.",

      "text": "Besides Jenny and Darla, the other characters are awful and/or underdeveloped.The kills are very boring, the Illuminati stuff is ridiculous, and the story is so similar to the original."

      "text": "Finally the worst one in the franchise, and not only in the franchise but Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation just became my new pick for the worst movie i've ever seen, the movie is terribly written, terribly produced, horribly performed, and there is literally zero thing on this movie that i like, the look of Leatherface in this one is just the worst thing ever and his/her scream is even worst, all the actor and the actresses performance in this movie is one of, if not the worst performances i've ever seen, they're so annoying and they're stupid, Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation is just so frustrating to watch and if it's not because of the franchise i already stop in the first 10 minutes of the film, it's a horrible horrible experience."

      "text": "The setup may be different but the middle is so similar to the original its a little jarring. Getting the \"alright, alright, alright\" from McConaughey was a big eye roll moment. Final act was incomprehensible, the plane for example??? Also I don't think a single person actually got Chain Sawed."
