Reily, and John Hawkes, the script and execution of The Perfect Storm is completely underwhelming. The direction is completely lackluster. The movie doesn't know how to start or end. The meat of the story is pretty nice, but the ending makes the whole movie seem pointless. This is a perfect example of a bad movie that is elevated by good performances. If you are a fan of any of these actors, you can find some enjoyment from The Perfect Storm."

It's doesn't seem to go anywhere and the movie made no effort of making me want to care about the crew. The only up side to this movie is that it is not a bad as Miami Vice (Movie)."

Some fo the stunts are impressive though, particularly Cloony cutting an anchor loose int eh midst of the storm. In the end, though, it achieves a slight ting of resonance, and the first rate musical score is pleasant."

The crew goes through trials of will and character when many things go wrong on the boat throughout the trip.  The movie is based off a true story that actually happened about a boat that was lost to a freak accident of nature creating what meteorologists call the perfects storm.  Overall the perfect storm was a great movie in my eyes had great acting, good visuals, awesome story and fantastic realism all mixed in one.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys movies based on true events.\r\tThe perfect storm was overall a great movie for it being based off real events.    The story was great, I would give it a 9 out of 10.  The acting was fantastic I had no problem believing that George Clooney Mark Walberg and the rest of the crew were fisherman.

      "text": "The thing that really irks me about THE PERFECT STORM is that I had read that it was a disaster film (and it's made pretty much clear in the title), but the actual disaster didn't get started for a whole forty minutes, which almost brought me to the point of thinking that \"Perfect Storm\" was some kind of metaphor. The basic layout is as follows: 1-30 minutes - characters are introduced with enough relationship statuses, innuendos, overly charismatic drama to create an entire soap opera; 31-40 minutes - the characters leave their spouses/fianc\u00c3\u00a9es, board the ship, but continue with the non sequiturs and double entendres that make you groan, \"Enough already!\"; 41-120 minutes - over an hour of TITANIC-esque intensity and dazzling (but terrifying, considering this is based on a true story) disaster scenes--which is exciting, but it makes you think, \"We go from soap opera...to disaster?\", because the beginning does NOT make sense to the rest of the film; 121-128 minutes - the film is coming to an end, with slightly less intensity, but thankfully no \"return of the soap opera\"; 129 minutes - the film's over, folks, you can go home now. That's the gist of this mediocre movie. It's just what you expect of a shipwreck film."

      "text": "The Perfect Storm is a great tribute to the men and women who risk their lives every day on the open sea for barely enough money to live on, and it is also based on a true story. I really enjoyed this film and watching the bonus features to see just how difficult it was to make, made me appreciate it that much more. It isn't without its flaws thou. The whole background story of love, looking for love, and flirting was very cheesy. The relationship between Diane Lane  Mark Wahlberg was necessary, the rest was not, such as hearing his thoughts before he's about to drown in the ocean... come on! I also didn't like the supposition as to what happened on the ship during their finally voyage. Did Sully and Murph really fight? The rogue wave? The shark? We don't know and neither does the author, it was just Hollywood getting in the way again, but overall I did like the movie and really appreciate how hard it was to actually make."

      "text": "The Perfect Storm is exactly what I expected and was actually better than anticipated. Telling the story of the convergence of two storm systems: a nor'easter and Hurricane Grace, The Perfect Storm is a harrowing real life disaster film. Focusing in on the Andrea Gail, a fishing vessel, and the problems she encounters as her crew battles valiantly against the storm with their loved ones awaiting them on land, it does not take a genius to figure out that things will not work out for them. With excellent special effects and thrilling sequence after thrilling sequence on the boat and in the air, The Perfect Storm is exactly what a disaster movie should be: entertaining. As it is based on a true story, the film tries to add weight to it and sort of works, but mostly just feels hamfisted and too manipulative, especially at the end.That ending is really what drags this one down, which is a shame. Introducing us to Captain Billy Tyne (George Clooney), Bobby Shatford (Mark Wahlberg), Murph (John C. Reilly), Bugsy (John Hawkes), Sully (William Fichtner), and Andre Pierre (Allen Payne), who are the six men aboard the Andrea Gail, The Perfect Storm really tries to develop its characters. It shows their loves and their lives before they set sail one last time to their grave at the sea, while constantly cutting away from the scene at sea to show how their loved ones are handling it all. In particular, there is a special emphasis on Bobby's girlfriend Christina (Diane Lane), who eagerly awaits his return with his mother. Yet, the film's cloying and manipulative punches at the end border on offensive and always absurd. As their ship goes down and the men realize their fate is a bleak one, two things occur. One, Murph remarks how hard his son will take his death. Two, Bobby tells Chris he loves her even without being able to say goodbye. In the aftermath of the sinking, Chris reveals that she had a dream with Bobby where he relayed the exact message he said to her while at sea. Considering that these are real people, to be playing this angle up is honestly very sad to see. The final words from Bobby being the most head-smackingly stupid moment of this film.That said, man those waves are cool, eh? This is a disaster movie, so it is tough to not just look past the issues with the characters. The scene at the bar and the gathering of the crew wet my pallet just enough to make me care about these people, as well as the fact that it is real. At all points, I was rooting that they could get back to shore with their load of 60,000 pounds of fish. After the crew had gone through so much together and struggled mightily to find fish, this gold mine of fish felt hard earned. I wanted to see them be reunited with their families and be able to leave the business having made a very good score. However, there is no such moment. Where the characters may be paper thin, this is a film that wears its heart on its sleeve, which bleeds openly when these men continue to fight against the massive odds before them.Yet, the star here is the special effects. Coupled with an excellent score from James Horner, The Perfect Storm has a great cinematic quality with excellent scope and ferocious thrills. No matter how many times it shows the boat hitting massive waves or showing the Air Force rescuing various people, the film is always laced with tension. Director Wolfgang Petersen shows that he still has it throughout this film as, in lesser hands, one can only imagine how awful this film would have turned out. As it stands, it is a film that leaves you riding the edge of your seat for the entire second half of the film and, as a result, really meets my requirements for a film of this type. It is a thrilling piece of cinema with great special effects that does an excellent job showing both the danger and the camaraderie of the moment with these six men putting their differences behind them to unite and confront mother nature. Though a battle they will not win, this does not mean the small victories and battles along the way are any less thrilling to watch unfold.Celebrating the brave men that sacrifice their lives to save others or to provide for their families, The Perfect Storm is one of those disaster movies that do not really get made too often nowadays, which is a shame. Wolfgang Petersen delivers a film that tries develop some characters and manipulates our emotions too heavy-handedly, but it is also a film with a great cinematic feeling to it that allows it to rise above its inadequacies. Thrilling, old school style filmmaking that is blessed with modern effects, The Perfect Storm is not well rounded, but its thrills, spills, and real life chills allow it to remain a solid and thoroughly entertaining disaster film."

It takes forever to get going, and each scene is dragged out until the viewer reaches wits end. Even after all of that, the movie never rewards us for our troubles, instead giving us clich\u00e9 after clich\u00e9 in the script and very static characters. It may have great special effects, but they're wasted in this movie."

Pacted full of cliches, overly dramatic music, I couldn't come to have any sympathy for the characters and there's about 40 minutes of over the top quick cut shaky cam action footage where you really have no idea what in the hell is going on. Terrible, terrible movie."

      "text": "barely a high tide..The Perfect StormThe Perfect Storm is a plot driven adventurous drama about a group of guys visiting unknown territories in the sea world with an immovable agenda. Despite of stunning visual effects, sharp sound effects and background score, the so called cinematic experience that it promises, is left untouched. Either the characters are undercooked or are brimmed with chalky substance, since it isn't convincing for a single frame; no thrills in here are thrilling. It is undeniably finely detailed but as much as deep it goes, either the discovered hollowness shucks away its credibility or the surfing through character's perspective grows non-feasible. The feature somehow seems in a hurry, it skips steps over husky bits and directs all his guns on delivering the crisp which unfortunately is wafer thin in here. It might be gullible on terms of commercial aspects, but its self-created hallucination of forcibly imputing artsy factors, is just plainly disappointing. There are few sequences where they get it right and won't even make you blink twice with its ruggedness and earthy theme that is palpable to its tone. Clooney is definitely not in his A game, he seems confused and isn't clearly expressive with Wahlberg's scattering portrayal of any whatsoever persona and addition to that even Riley, Lane and Hawkes; stars like such, fails to create the anticipated impact on screen. Armed with an incongruent adaptation by Wittliff, Peterson's somewhat decent execution skills too couldn't save this sinking ship as it falls flatly on character development or even logistics at times. The bravura of work by sound department that leaves your seat shaken up and few cheap yet thoroughly entertaining thrills are the only high points of this tomfoolery projected under the adventurous genre. The Perfect Storm is barely a high tide let alone be \"the storm\" and as far as perfection is concerned, it certainly is mythical."

      "text": "A tribute to the fishermen and the power of nature.This film, based on true events, tells the story of a swordfish fishing vessel who's caught in the middle of a colossal storm. It's a cinematic approach to the dangers of Grand Banks fishermen's face in real life. Directed by Wolfgang Petersen, has screenplay by William D. Wittliff, based on the book by Sebastian Junger. The cast is headed by George Clooney (in the role of Billy Tyne, master of the fishing vessel) and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (in the role of Linda Greenlaw, captain of another ship), but also has other very talented actors like Bob Gunton, William Fichtner, John C. Reilly, Mark Wahlberg and Diane Lane.Since the beginning of time that the sailors and fishermen were subject to the dangers of sea and storms. This film talks about it, and a particular case that led to the loss of several lives when a storm of rare proportions explodes on the waters off of Gloucester, US. The script is well written and the story is touching. The sets and photography are blameless and the visual and sound effects are excellent, especially portraying the storm (indeed deserved the Oscar nomination precisely for Best Sound and Best Visual Effects). George Clooney was wonderfully in his role, giving him a huge personality, an old sailor soul who loves the sea, even with all the dangers of it. The cast, however, was all at a great level and manages to capture the sympathy of the audience, who suffers with them and go with them to the sea, eager to return to earth and get away from that cruel and rough waters.Although this movie has passed quietly and still be a film that is not much remembered, its an excellent disaster film (much better than others, showing disasters that never happen) that deals with facts that cost the lives of hundreds of fishermen and sailors every year. So, apart from a great movie, it's a beautiful tribute to these men and their families."
