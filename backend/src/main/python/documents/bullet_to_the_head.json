      "text": "What kills this movie for me, more than anything else, is the co-star Sung Kang.  He's terrific in the Fast  Furious movies, but he's criminally underdeveloped, under-directed, and just terrible in this film.  He needs to have at least SOME backbone to serve as Sly's foil.  Shahi could have been directed better as well.  What's more, the ending is terrible.  Don't bother considering this one  see Joe Morgenstern's review for further guidance."

If you like Cobra, Get Carter, The Specialist, or any of his other movies along this line, you will like this one.  And isn't entertainment what we go to the movies for?"

Sylvester kicks ass throughout the film, sung Kang is good as a cop and Jason momoa is the ultimate gangster. The  killer vs killer  style is very well done by director Walter hill. I enjoyed bullet to the head, a must watch. But not as good as movies like pulp fiction, but just good time pass kick ass action. So, 7/10 is my review."

If you go in with zero expectations, then you deserve to be disappointed.  This ain't Shakespeare, folks.  It's a rough and ready popcorn movie that just happens to be done very well."

We got one good Expendables film and now we get Arnie, Willis, and of course Stallone shoveled into their own me too action fiestas. If you are a fan of action films and old people jokes then this is the year for you! Oh, this is a movie review not a rant column. Sorry, the movie is a great Stallone movie. As it should be being directed by the master of this genre."

Seeing a 70 yr Stallone all steroid-ed up with his face still botched up, was unnerving. Seeing him battle the young, hunky\rJason M... was a just an embarrassment. Skip this one folks! Save your hard-earned dollars and see something else."

Outside of the slow start my only real complaint withthe movie is that it puts too much emphasis on the plot, which is overly familiar and the team up theme of the movie ends up going nowhere. Still, if you're a Stallone fan or are just looking for an action movie with an old-school feel, then this will provide for a good watch. It's not great, but it's still enjoyable."

I suppose the credit mostly due to the direction of Walter Hill and the supporting role played by Sung Kang and Jason Momoa. If you are a dude (or a chick that likes bravado) this movie is a decent middle of the road watch.\r Some nit picking. Why is Jimmy Bobo such a \"bad\" hitman? He leaves witnesses all over the place. Sentimental Hitmen don't live long.\r p.s. how come I never get invited to topless masquerade balls?"

The script is often stupid (both in terms of dialog and plot) and a number of the main actors are just terrible (Jason Mamoa is abysmal and Stallone is typically stiff)   But it is a decent action movie that is actually entertaining in that context for a majority of the movie.  Anyone who has zero expectations should not be watching this movie.  You need to go in with an action movie expectation and its fine, not great, but fine.  But why would anyone trust the reviews of anyone who always gives a 0, a la Marco?"

Stallone plays a hit man who teams up with a cop (Sung Kang) to avenge their partners and shut down a group of gangsters. Stallone acts more wooden than ever and the character's weak attempt to channel Eastwood's racist curmudgeon in \"Grand Turino\" is embarrassing. The action and writing are uninspired. Just skip it."

      "text": "Can a film built on cliches and hammy acting be any good? No, it can't but it can pass the time better than you might expect. When hit man Jimmy Bobo (Sylvester Stallone) loses his partner Louis (Jon Seda) in a double cross he joins forces with Taylor Kwon (Sung Kang), a DC police officer whose partner was killed by the same group. The problem with Bullet to the Head isn't that it feels like been there done that, its that it believes its actually being original, that it isn't the hundredth odd couple action film to exist, at least when the Last Boy Scout came out, it didn't pretend it was something it wasn't, original. Almost the entirety of Bullet to the Head is cliches and while they irritate the film does have some thrills to it. The action is good, not great but its got a certain charm, the film uses profanity properly, it actually feels like it belongs and these two characters meld well meaning the cheesy dialogue does provide a few laughs although the script is filled with unnatural dialogue delivered by actors who can clearly tell its dreadful. The supporting cast is awful with Christian Slater continuing his slow journey to obscurity and Jason Momoa playing a unintentionally hilarious sadist. All in all the film is filled with problems but its oddly still fun watching Sly murder countless numbers of people even if at times it doesn't make a lick of sense."

      "text": "Bullet to the Heat is a decent action film with some high quality fight scenes and good acting. Sylvester Stallone plays his typical BA role and Sung Kang continues to emerge as a potential star on the rise. I also loved the addition, though small, of Sarah Shahi. I really hope she starts to get some bigger roles because she is a fantastic actress and has such a unique and exotic look. The flaws in the movie were pretty major though. The plot development was frantic and sort of a mess and the element of Kang's character being ignorant to the police's involvement seemed kind of silly considering how obvious is was to the audience and even the rest of the characters in the film. The gun play was also horrendous. How many movies are going to use the silencer in this unrealistic fashion? It's really getting old. I also thought Sly's character was a little over the top. It's tough to \"root for\" a protagonist that you can't stand and his character was a bit too much of a jerk to get in his corner. On a slightly off-topic note, I find it ironic that Stallone has opined against guns and the 2nd amendment but then makes movies like this where there are criminals and crooked cops left and right. Talk about hypocrisy. Back to the point though, this was a decent movie that had some entertainment value but nothing more really."

There were some cliche lines that seemed intentionally overdone. The detective (Kang) was poorly acted and annoying at times. Regardless this was definitely the best of the most recent 2 action movies out (Parker and Die Hard). So if you like mind-numbing action movies this is a pretty well done one."

I'm pretty sure that other things happened in the movie, but nothing could break my trance. Sly is Rocky. Nothing else matters. If you want to see an action flick with an aging star I'd save my money and go see the new Die Hard movie when it comes out."

It was just an average action movie, and had the low budget feeling. Honestly I can`t blame it on any of the actors. I just didn`t care for the movie overall.

It's not that it's terrible because it's not terrible, but it's storyline is uninteresting and unoriginal. If this movie had came out in the 80s, it probably could have been a big hit. But since it's 2013, i don't think we're into those typical action movies anymore. Overall, just a boring, unoriginal story of vengeance."

      "text": "A disastrously pointless excuse for a movie. Why does Sylvester Stallone star in a movie in his sixties with a shirt off! Seriously he's old and there's nothing to show! Stallone plays Jimmy Bobo, a fearless assassin who kills his targets and in this movie we are totally unaware if he's working on his own demands or if he's a contracted killer with a boss. He poses another action flick with not much excitement to promise. The only decent actor is Sung Kang, who plays a detective called Taylor Kwon: a cop who associates with Bobo as they attempt to track down and take out the killer, played by Jason Momoa. Their relationship in this particular case is hard to bear and they might as well have killed each other to save the bother of working together. Bobo also has a daughter who appears in bits of the movie and she's a tattooist who mostly tattoos herself and makes her look ridiculous.\r Director Walter Hill's 1987 action flick, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, which was Red Heat was quite boring as well as is Bullet to the Head, but Red Heat had Arnie in it and he's more entertaining and fabulous to watch! Bullet to the Head is just a major let down and hopefully there's no sequel on the way any time soon."
