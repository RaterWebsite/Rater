      "text": "\u201cBlack and Blue\u201d is a police procedural that offers a few pleasures along the way.  The plot, however, is a plodding process of pedantic predictability.  It\u2019s not just that you can predict the storyline from a mile away - if you were circling the globe in a space capsule, the plot would still be painfully self-evident.Alicia West (Naomie Harris) is a vet who has served two tours in Afghanistan and decided to return home to the Ninth Ward in New Orleans, become a cop and continue her service to country.  Most of her colleagues and adversaries are simply cardboard cut-outs.  Apparently, all white cops are bad:  uninterested in the plight of blacks in poorer areas of the city, obnoxiously aggressive jerks at best, murderers at worst.  With only minor exceptions, blacks are gang members living the code of the streets.What makes this film worthwhile is Naomie Harris.  You may have seen her in 2016\u2019s \u201cMoonlight.\u201d  Some will recognize her as the first black Miss Moneypenny in \u201cSkyfall\u201d and \u201cSpectre,\u201d the two most recent installments in the James Bond franchise.  Her performance here is a study in controlled intensity.  Her self-control it admirable; it\u2019s probably all she can do to keep from shooting the director and the screenwriter.  In an outtake shown when the closing credits begin to roll, she displays a smile so luminous that you could see it from that space capsule.  It\u2019s the only time you see her smile in the film, presumably because she read the script beforehand.Mike Colter makes his obligatory turn as the drug kingpin, Darius, a bit less two-dimensional than it might have been.  His role here as an intimidating thug offers an interesting departure from his much more appealing roles in \u201cLuke Cage\u201d and this year\u2019s TV show \u201cEvil.\u201d  As Mouse, Tyrese Gibson (best known as a pillar of the \u201cFast and Furious\u201d franchise) takes full advantage of being the only other character in the film with any depth or nuance.If you\u2019re an action-adventure junkie, \u201cBlack and Blue\u201d won\u2019t disappoint.  There\u2019s plenty of action, lots of fights and an abundance of chase scenes.  Unfortunately, a lot of those chases end up at dead ends."

      "text": "Naomie Harris plays rookie police officer who stumbles upon some dirty cops and happens to record their illegal actions on her body cam. The rest of the movie scrambles her all over her former gang-ridden neighborhood trying to stay alive (with the help of an old friend played by Tyrese Gibson). Although there's not much subtle about the script's messages and there are some flaws in the logic, director Deon Taylor has created a tense drama with more suspense coming from the chase and interactions than from violence (although there is some of that). Harris and the rest of the cast do a good job of helping make what could have been a trite corrupt cop flick into a dark and compelling drama."

      "text": "This nifty little thriller has Naomi Harris (28 Days later) as a young rookie cop who finds herself on the run in the ghetto after she witnesses a murder done by some bad shields which include sexy stud Frank Grillo (Purge Anarchy). The movie is edge of your seat exciting with a solid fierce lead performance from Harris. With everything going on in the world now it's more relevant and important than ever. Political statements aside the movie is fast, energetic and wonderfully entertaining.Budget: $12mBox Office: $22.7m8/10"
