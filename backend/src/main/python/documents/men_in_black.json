It's a great film that you can rewatch again and again.

A perfect action-comedy."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "In terms of storyline, the film is pretty much disposable. But in terms of performances and over-the-top action, it's a slam dunk: Men In Black is a blast."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "A science fiction comedy that was a surprise hit and created a successful franchise. It strengths are the awesome humor, hilarious ideas and concepts, special effects and of cause the actors. The Men in Black are based on a real life UFO conspiracy theory (I hesitate to use the word real life in connection with conspiracy theories). These are men in black suits looking like or claiming to be government agents who are speaking with people who have seen UFOs or other related strange things. They want that the people remain quite about the incidents and often they are threatening or bullying those people. The movie uses this idea to full potential as the Men in Black are a super secret agency that are policing aliens on earth and protecting mankind while keeping everything secret from public and government knowledge (No human except themselves on earth knows that they exist including even former members). It helps a lot that the movie takes itself not that serious and uses a lot of opportunities to make fun of (alien) conspiracy theories. It has of cause slapstick, situational humor, quirky characters and gadgets that would be excellent in superhero comic books. Some might even be to crazy or unbelievable for comic book science ;-). After the awesome set up introduction scene we follow officer James Darrell Edwards pursuing a suspect who has some strange characteristics. This is taken some interest in him and ends with a job offer wilder than what he can imagine. I like the story, set up and world building. It is a perfect mixture of seriousness and humor. If done in a bad way it would be just hilarious or even unbelievable. Here I never doubted anything and the movie was enjoyable from beginning to end. I just remembered an advice for movie makers \u201cIf you make the movie enjoyable, interesting and immersive you can get away with a lot of stuff\u201d. I want to praise the script and ideas. This movie is so full of ideas that set up a remarkable world and lore. I will also praise the actors. Lets start with Will Smith as James Darrell Edwards. He is the new guy who enters wonderland. He is funny, entertaining and it is one of his best performances (in comedy!). Tommy Lee Jones as Kevin Brown is the stereotype of the awesome no nonsense agent. He is the yin to the yang and together they are quite enjoyable. Vincent D\u2019Onofrio is a great antagonist. I cant spoil why but he made an impact and positive impression. For the side characters we have the excellent Frank the pug, Linda Fiorentino as (Dr.) Laurel Weaver, Rip Torn as Zed and of cause the worm guys;-). I truly enjoyed the cast. Visually the special effects were amazing for its time and aged impressively well. ILM (Industrial Light & Magic) are legends in the business for many good reasons. The soundtrack is good too. I almost had forgotten that Will Smith was also a rapper. Overall this was a pleasant surprise for my friends and me. It was one of the best movies of that year. It is carefully made as missteps would make a laughingstock out of it. I recommend it as it is refreshing, entertaining and has great humor atop of funny ideas."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Men in Black is great fun from start to finish. If you care to look past the rather ridiculous plot (only occasionally), this is hugely enjoyable. The cinematography is skillful likewise with the direction, and the special effects are wonderful. The script is irreverent, and there are some truly great performances. Will Smith proves here he CAN act, and Tommy Lee Jones as usual is marvellous. Both make a unique and hilarious double act. Then there is fine support from underrated actor Rip Torn and from Linda Fiorentino, who is a talented actress that hasn't earned herself a high acting profile yet. The finale is a little overblown, but you cannot deny this is a fun film. 9/10 Bethany Cox"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "it is a good alien movie, Will smith is a good distraction, and the future teach(especially the guns) are flat out awesome.

The jokes seemed to keep the story going.2- The story was second rate due to the jokes, too many jokes and not enough story for my taste. Make me laugh, but make a creative story line to keep me encapsulated and interested.Because the storyline was run by the jokes, and the jokes weighed down what little there was of the story, the movie came off to me as more of a comedy series on youtube than a quality movie.At the same time, I love fun comedy and thought the movie made for fun, though pointless TV.

I don't get it. He is simply not nearly bad ass enough to have that much ego.  Further, MIB movie contains the all too familiar cranky, veteran partner in Tommy Lee Jones who strikes me as just a crotchety old man throughout the whole thing.  Great for kids, maybe, but MIB will likely not date well, so the longevity it will have with even the 13 and under demographic remains to be seen."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Have you ever seen a tabloid headline like this: \"Woman gives birth to son of six-headed alien\"? Men in Black, the new science fiction comedy from cinematographer-turned-director Barry Sonnenfeld (Get Shorty), postulates that such stories are not the result of fertile imaginations, but accurate representations of the truth. You see, ever since the 1960s, Earth has become an intergalactic hideout for aliens in need of a place to lie low for a while. Currently, there are over 1500 visitors, most in New York City (based on personal experience, that number may be low), and their ranks include such high-profile names as Sylvester Stallone (he obviously had trouble mastering the language), Newt Gengrich (guess what he looks like in his natural form), and Dennis Rodman (who knew?).\r In many ways, Men in Black is the movie that Mars Attacks! wanted to be, but wasn't. This is a snappy, clever, often-funny motion picture that provides the perfect blend of science fiction-style action with comic dialogue. The screenplay, credited to Ed Solomon (and based on the Marvel comic book by Lowell Cunningham) has a sly, sophisticated edge that many blockbuster scripts lack. Sonnenfeld's direction is crisp and the editing is tight, resulting in a film that clocks in at a mere ninety-five minutes, which proves to be a nearly-perfect length.\r That's not to say that the movie is of masterpiece status, or even light on flaws. There are plenty of minor problems along the way, and the ending is somewhat rushed and anticlimactic. On the whole, however, viewers are less likely to remember the glitches than the clever one-liners, subtle parodies, and effective use of visual effects to integrate aliens into everyday existence. Men in Black's deliciously unconventional spirit lends a refreshing twist to a premise that has fueled numerous conspiracy theory movies and one currently-popular television series.\r The chief pleasure of Men in Black isn't being dazzled by the special effects, but enjoying the deadpan performances of Tommy Lee Jones (whose offhand attitude towards the most bizarre events would make Jack Webb proud) and Will Smith. This is a rare case when the multi-million dollar, computer-generated creatures don't upstage their real-life co-stars. Smith and Jones are a fine pair, and the film's focus on them never wavers. However, while the two leads can't complain about screen-time, the supporting players have all been short-changed. Linda Fiorentino, who gets third billing, is vastly underused, appearing only peripherally throughout. Vincent D'Onofrio (as the bad alien's human host) and Rip Torn (as Zed, the leader of the Men in Black) don't fare much better.\r A word of caution for those who expect to see Independence Day 2: despite the attempts of certain marketing campaigns to link the two, they're vastly different in scope and intent. Men in Black is an outright comedy (in fact, some of its satire is directed at movies like last year's box office champ), not a pastiche of worn sci-fi/adventure elements, and there's no big space battle to be found. In fact, from the opening credits to the closing ones, our heroes stay firmly rooted on terra firma. Those accepting Men in Black for what it is will likely agree that this is one of 1997's more satisfying big-budget offerings."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I present to you... possibly one of the best movies featuring both Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith.
