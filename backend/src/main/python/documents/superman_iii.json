Don't get me wrong, he's an amazing comedian, but he should have never been considered for a role this toned down and tame."

      "text": "'Superman III' is the kind of movie that is a miscalculation of all things in the genre, and even the character like Superman himself. Everything you knew and loved about the character gets misused so much, it's a wonder why the studio was even making these movies anymore. Christopher Reeve is back as the title character, and he must confront his inner demons, which leads to a rather ridiculous fight that, while somewhat technically impressive for 1983, its overall execution is rather clunky and misguided. Richard Pryor is the latest comic relief here, and he does what he can in a premise that should not require any comedic effect, but for some reason, the filmmakers behind this movie felt that comedy was needed for a story like this. I could go on about why this movie was a colossal disappointment, but I think just a simple \"Don't watch it!\" should be more than enough to give you an idea as to why this movie should never be seen."

      "text": "This was the third of the original Superman series, and definitely a step down from the of greatness its predecessors. It's certainly not a bad film, but relies too much on camp and comic relief (even some slap stick) and gives Richard Pryor too big a role although he is entertaining. In this one Richard Pryor works as a computer engineer for a corrupt company, and is caught stealing from the company in a sneaky way. Instead of firing him, his boss, the sleazy executive uses him to achieve his goals, which are often illegal or unethical. Lois is seen briefly at the beginning of the movie but says she is going on vacation to Bermuda. Clark visits Smallville and reunites with Lana Lang. At some point Superman is exposed to some sort of synthesized, bizarro Kryptonite which affects his personality in a negative way. Superman becomes selfish and mean-spirited, committing vandalism, getting drunk, banging floozies, and does the bidding of the evil businessman by doing damage to a trade ship so that he can bang the evil executive's ditsy yet sexy mistress. Eventually Superman overcomes whatever is possessing him in a climactic battle between Clark and Bad Superman. Superman ends up battling a supercomputer android that is sort of similar to Brainiac. It turns out that Brainiac was originally supposed to be the main villain in the movie. I kinda wish they had gone there and actually introduced Brainiac. What we ended up getting in this movie in terms of adversaries were close to Bizarro and Brainiac, but they weren't officially in the movie. The special effects were good for the time, though a downgrade from the previous flicks."

The film is decently paced and there are one or neat touches such as when Superman turns nasty.CONS: The storytelling is very clunky for me, while the script is awful. Margot Kidder apparently wanted little to do with this film and if true I'm afraid it does show, while Robert Vaughan is a pretty poor replacement for Gene Hackman and the less said about Pamela Stephenson the better. Also the direction is rather heartless and using Richard Pryor as the source of the laughs just didn't work.Overall, it is disappointing and lacklustre but it is watchable unlike the fourth. Anyway that is another story. 5/10 Bethany Cox"

      "text": "Part of the first wave of high-concept, big-budget, special-effects-heavy films that emerged in the wake of Star Wars, 1978's Superman: The Movie, like a handful of its contemporaries, threatened to give blockbuster event movies a good name. Fresh off the success of The Omen, director Richard Donner took on the story of the Man Of Steel with the seriousness due an American myth, using newfangled effects to make the fantastic seem plausible. The film's \"You'll believe a man can fly\" tagline might have provided a brilliant marketing hook, but it also served as something of a mission statement, particularly in Superman's early segments. From Superman's Kryptonian origins to his coming of age in Smallville, Donner lends his story a sense of awe usually reserved for those filming westerns, baseball movies, or The Bible. The film becomes comic-booky only when its hero, having disappeared into his Fortress Of Solitude for much of Vietnam and Watergate, hits jaded Metropolis. By his own admission on this new DVD version's commentary track, Donner saw Superman as three films in one, with the gag-and-fight-heavy Metropolis segment evincing a different tone than what came before. Even if it feels removed from, and in some respects not on par with, the rest of the film, it succeeds on its own terms (one horrifying bit of spoken verse by Margot Kidder's Lois Lane aside). Effective both as Superman and as the bumbling Clark Kent, Christopher Reeve still seems ideal for the part, if for no other reason than his ability to summon up a convincing sense of intensity when charged with saving the world. He would need to rely on this skill more and more as the Superman sequels\u2014now released on no-frills DVDs alongside the features-packed original\u2014piled up. With one exception, they illustrate the diminishing returns that plagued most blockbuster franchises in the sequel-mad '80s. Originally entering production at the same time as the first Superman, 1981's Superman II was also to have been directed by Donner. When the budget mounted, temperamental producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind first ditched the two-at-once plan, then ditched Donner, bringing in their Three Musketeers director Richard Lester (A Hard Day's Night, Petulia) to finish the project after the original Superman turned a substantial profit. The seams show, but Lester's visual wit and trademark energy steer Reeve's struggle with Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman, returning from the original), Kryptonian outlaw General Zod (Terence Stamp), and his cohorts in all the right directions. One Metropolis fight scene alone would make it a worthy successor, but the film also allows Reeve and Kidder ample time to develop the humanity (or Kryptonity) of their characters. Not so 1983's Lester-directed Superman III, which displayed the series' first struggle with what could be called the Planet Of The Apes Paradox: How do you keep topping previous entries with conspicuously smaller budgets? Superman III's answer is to play for laughs, but outside of an opening-credits slapstick ballet that could have come from one of Lester's '60s comedies, they come few and far between. The ideas might sound good, particularly the synthetic Kryptonite that turns Superman into a boozing jerk, but they never get developed, while high-profile guest star Richard Pryor appears somewhat puzzled at his own presence in the film. But the bottom of the barrel remained unscraped. Appearing in 1987, when most assumed that the series had been put to rest, Superman IV: The Quest For Peace, with a story dreamed up in part by Reeve, plays like the unholy union of a PSA and the WWF. Stirred by a schoolboy's letter, Reeve decides to rid the world of nuclear weapons by tossing them in a giant net and throwing them at the sun. Meanwhile, Hackman's Luthor, aided by slang-talking surfer nephew Jon Cryer, creates a new super-rival: Nuclear Man, who locks horns with Reeve against a variety of rear-projection backdrops. By this point, the production values had dipped so low that director Sidney J. Furie might as well have imported footage from the old George Reeves series. Unsurprisingly, the series ended there, its first two entries illustrating what grand-scale entertainment could do, the remainder illustrating the perils of doing it to death."

      "text": "Lester has broken so many rules by now, that he doesn't have any ground to stand on, flying doesn't help in this world.Superman 3Lester is a victim of the textbook trilogy syndrome. And when I say syndrome, we've had plenty of acclaimed makers fall down this road unwillingly and brutally in this final lap of the race. The director Richard Lester arguably should not be blamed. I mean, I would rather put the Newmans, the writers on the stand. For most of the time, the off-putting characteristic of the film is not the execution of the flim-flam hokum but the very incoherent punches that is told to emerge every now and then as an excuse of a crime world. But none of these crimes are actually sinister, probably because none of them communicates with us, the audience.Also what's at stake here is either a formal day to day white collar lawbreaking activity or a misunderstood opportunity seized by someone trying to make it big, none of it actually is a threat that can challenge who arguably is the all mighty powerful in contrast to the very super society of his. Addition to that, the unconventional and irrelevant humor is what tips over this already hanging-by-the-thread film.I mean it starts with a childish humor where a choreographed physical accidents is supposed to be funny along with anecdotes in the film like old marriage jokes, slapstick humor between irritated colleagues and cheap laughs coming from a lazy worker. Other major thing that film lacks is \"logic\". To be honest, the entire series has never seen the face of the base of the physics law, but at least the previous adventures were fun, in big bold capital letters FUN. And this always, always overpowered the limitations of the early installments, but here not only that liberty is taken for granted but is also just not juicy enough for you to eradicate a big priority as such, not for anyone, not even for Superman."

      "text": "After seeing \"Superman II\", I thought the franchise couldn't get any worse... I was wrong. Despite retaining some small merits, this film is far worse and really shouldn't have been missed by those involved, especially Christopher Reeve. In fact, the actor even considered not acting in the film, and his participation was only guaranteed at the last minute, as I found out after some reading, which I did after seeing the film.For me, this movie has the worst script conception I've seen, within the Superman movies. In practice, it is a duel between the hero and a wealthy villain, called Webster. Initially, he wants to ward off competition from Colombian coffee by influencing the region's climate through a satellite, commanded by him thanks to a hacker he discovered in his own companies. When the superhero ruins his plans, he starts chasing him to kill him and get out of his way. Amidst this, the hero still has time to go to an alumni meeting of his old high school, where he meets an old flame, the former prom queen, Lana.The franchise lost its footing after the departure of Richard Donner, and there is nothing that can save the film from being considered terribly bad. The plot is surreal because it is so bad, unrealistic and false. The hero, until now seen as a well of integrity, and in theory in love with Lois Lane (who in this film virtually disappears), is almost put in the bed of two other women, in what we might consider a huge moral flaw. I could give lots of examples of other situations and moments without logic or meaning, but it would be redundant.Reeve does what he can in the role of Superman, but the actor made little effort, he wasn't really in the project with body and soul and his performance reflects that lack of will to be there. It sticks to the basics and doesn't shine. Annette O'Toole also manages to honor the basics, but she can't give us much more. Richard Pryor is moderately funny, but barely succeeds at making us laugh. Jackie Cooper and Robert Vaughan also don't bring any spark or charisma to the film. Pamela Stephenson is irritating, and Margot Kidder was almost relegated to the trailer, as she only appears for about five minutes.Technically, the film has some (few) redeeming virtues, such as the rather well-conceived cinematography, the satisfactorily conducted editing, and the light, relatively fast pace of the film, which avoids tiring the audience with an excessively long duration. Also, the soundtrack did reasonably well, even though the most famous pieces of music I've heard are pretty much the same as in every Superman movie. There are also one or two scenes worthy of anthology for their impact and notoriety, such as the fight between Superman's ego and alter-ego. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't go much further: the sets aren't very well done, there are a lot of cheap and unbelievable visuals and specials, and the movie generally looks cheaper and more fake than its predecessors."
