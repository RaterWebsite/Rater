Like I prefer Jake Lloyd in Phantom Menace over his performance in this film. Everything is fine till, until that end. The ending has got to be one of the stupidest and most, what in the world, moments in film. I still don't understand what happened in that ending. Also Arnold Schwarzenegger punches a dear. So that was.... something? This movie gets a 3/10 and an F."
