For sure this is not an academy award quality screenplay and some elements are quite cheesy but still enjoyable. This definitely well worth the watch and particularly if you're into 80s action movies. But for God's sake stay far away from the awful sequel Escape Plan Hades, even if the third part Escape Plan Extraction is a fine sequel."

      "text": "A film can't be recommended only on the merits of its big, action-packed finale, and Escape Plan isn't the movie on which to make an exception to that rule. The first 3/4 of the film are plodding, so much exposition and senseless set-up that has you crawling for some classic, '80s-level action. An explosion, at least. But as meandering as most of the film is, it's never boring, and the promise of one, extended, awesome action scene is just enough to keep you invested in the proceedings. Stallone and Schwarzenegger  and we, the action fans of the world  finally have their big, team-up movie, and like the action powerhouses themselves, Escape Plan is a bulky mess. It still knows how to fire a mean weapon, though."

      "text": "Upon looking at the cast of Escape Plan, it seemed like another type of Expendables 2 or Red 2 type movie restating that \"old guys are cool.\" We all have seen one these types of movies with no such plot or storyline, just 80ish minutes of action. Just seeing that the movie was 115 minutes and that Arnold Shwarzenegger was in it didn't seem right so I had to go see it.\r Escape Plan is the story of Ray Breslin (Sylvester Stallone) whose job is to test the security of prisons around the world. When asked to test a prison that makes criminals certain people \"disappear\" he accepts the offer and is taken to the prison. After soon learning that the whole thing was a setup, he meets Emil Rottmayer (Arnold Shwarzenegger), and together they attempt a breakout.\r To me it seemed like another scheme just to get the two men back on screen together but it turned out to be much more. I enjoyed watching the chemistry on screen between characters and it seemed effortless (probably because they've been doing these roles for 35+ years).\r The prison (picture one and two) was very unrealistic compared to the regular prison the movie started off with. The mix of CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) and soundstage filming turned out nice, but the overall concept of the cells was a little too imaginary. The guards (picture two) were all dressed in these black suits and cheap party masks. Though it seemed unnecessary at first, I realized that this was done so that the prisoners couldn\u2019t tell who the guards were, make friends with them, know their patterns or know when the guards were actually looking at them.\r The movie felt like someone said \"here's an idea, now make it a movie and release it next month.\" Don't get me wrong, the clever things Stallone did on screen must've taken some top writers to think up and wowed me. It was clear that they rushed the filming in some scenes though. For example, when a supposedly large helicopter was flying over the ocean, it actually looked like a toy helicopter on a wire over a lake.\r Overall, it was easy to tell that Shwarzenegger and Stallone didn't make the movie for the money, but more to show that they're still making movies. I did enjoy Escape Plan for the 115 minutes it ran, but I probably won't remember it a few weeks from now."

      "text": "Sylvester Stallone spends his days in jail, not because he\u2019s a criminal. He\u2019s a security specialist who cleverly breaks out of prisons to help them become less vunerable. When he\u2019s put into a super-security, supercool facility, he teams up with fellow inmate Arnold Schwarzenegger to make his break. The brain-teaser plot pushes credibility, but it still unravels without ever getting dumb or dull. The action is mostly average with a few moments of flash. You don\u2019t go to a movie with these two expecting great drama or deep meaning, just some macho fun and a few laffs. It's enjoyable popcorn escapism, literally."

      "text": "Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger alone could advertise this movie, and it's admittedly good to have them both on-screen, but Escape Plan tries to ravel in more cerebral plot which doesn't really work well nor does it have much depth in narrative. Script is sloppy, pacing is a bit clumsy and they soon revert back to the way of machine gun, which arguably might be the inherited charm they bring with them. This is a shame because these two of such fame deserve better material than the movie could provide.\r To its credit, it starts off pretty well as Ray Breslin (Stallone) is introduced as prison break specialist. He would voluntarily enter a prison to test its design and escape by taking advantage of its flaws. With his illustrious career, he is hired to test a highly secretive shadily illegal prison. Everything isn't what it seems in this semi futuristic prison where he meets Emil Rottmayer (Schwarzenegger) a fellow inmate who claims to know secret location of most wanted man. Cue in some conspiracy later; it transpires into menial action thriller.\r The events switch into slower pace later on, an ironic turn while the movie tries to churn clever ways to escape. It doesn't appeal much and frankly is inferior to many other similar movies with such premise. The tricks are dull, almost borderline implausible. The movie undoubtedly relies heavily on audience\u2019s willingness to accept the nifty gimmicks and reception towards the duo combo. Plot twists are expectable, with barely any fresh idea in the mix. The pace is also rather uneven, it stutters when it should gain momentum and eventually just fades gradually more anticlimactic as it goes.\r Script is downright terrible, as if the two action stars are still using dialogues from two decades ago. This may be due to familiarity to said style, but they would merit from smarter writing. Hammy one-liners are uttered every few minutes to weakly sell the bravado. Screenplay feels sporadic; sometimes it seems to cut too fast or just doesn't explain much. At the very least, it does provide some chuckles, although they may be somewhat intentional yet serendipitously are the more memorable moments of the movie. Stallone and Schwarzenegger still possess big screen charisma to attract audience; they do need more witty scenes and less exaggerated machismo though.\r Escape Plan benefits from the stars duo and barely legitimate prison break premise, but its lack of thrill and slapstick script don't make for a compelling watch."

So this movie had one\rlike that in both the portions.\r If you are a Schwarzenegger fan, you would disappoint a bit because the\rStallone rules whole show. I can say it was fairly balanced screenspace\ronly due to the capacity wise. Capacity comes under strength factor, so\rStallone had the upper hand and does justice. Schwarzenegger looked\rbetter than his last movie, especially with less wrinkles in his face.\r Good cast and good idea but lack of good stunt sequences and\rintelligent scenes. In a couple of scenes they show Stallone like\rvision Sherlock Holme had about the 3 dimensional structure of the\rsurrounds. It has been just imitated not the original. The Islamic\rcharacter in the movie as well included due to one reason and that is\rto find the position of their location. Otherwise the alliance would\rhave been only between Stallone and Schwarzenegger. That is why I was\rnot surprised by the elimination of that character.\r As the movie had great actors it was a little let down. Entertainment\ris guaranteed but visually not spectacular. Expected a better execution\rfrom the Swedish director. I believe he did not get a better crew\rexcept two iconic stars. It had a good commercial success, but won't\rremain in people's mind for a very long. If you are a fan of one of\rthese actors you would have a good time, but for others it is one time\rwatch and forgettable.\r 7.5/10"

Sylvester Stallone plays a guy who breaks out of prisons for a living. One day he's given a job to break out of a prison that is said to be impossible to break out of, but there's a twist. He's set up and treated like an actual prisoner and the only way out is to break out of the prison for real.\r The way the prison is ran is interesting and the way he breaks out is thrilling to watch. I would recommend this movie to anyone that loves action movies. My only complaint is that sometimes the dialog was a little cheesy and it took away from the tension of the movie. 88/100 B+"
