Additionally, I am not a religious person, so I was also a bit concerned that this movie would be a bit too \"preachy\" for my taste.  However, I decided to take a chance on this one (we did have others to choose from) and am, for the most part, glad I did.  My expectations were definitely surpassed.\r I think Greg Kinnear is a decent actor and did a solid job in this, but it is unfortunate that whenever I see him in a \"serious\" movie, I can't help but think of a certain silly cable TV show he hosted back in the day.  I was completely unimpressed with Kelly Reilly, the actress who played the wife.  The story is set in Nebraska, and it is blatantly obvious that Ms. Reilly is not an American actress.  She really did try to have an American accent, but failed miserably.  Lo & behold, she is British.  I wouldn't have a problem with this if she actually succeeded with her American accent!  For me, she was the weak link in the movie.  However, the main story really revolved around the father & son, so she had more of a supporting role, thank goodness!  The other supporting players were fine, but their roles (church-goers/church leaders) weren't entirely pivotal to the movie, in my opinion.  I must say, I think the best acting actually came from the child actor who played the son.  For a small child, he was actually fantastic!\r I personally did not find this movie to be heavy on the religion, which was quite a relief.  In fact, I felt the story was very touching.  The root of this movie is really about the love between a father & his son; the son has a phenomenal experience, the father struggles to believe him and subsequently questions his own beliefs because of it.  It's an enjoyable film, but one I probably could have waited for on DVD, as I normally do with all the rest!"}, {"rating": "0", "text": "The whole movie seems based  on a 5 minute video interview to the kid and parents. The rest of the movie were fillers. When the movie is over, I started wondering if the kid's story was even real, as he used language that was part of his life, being in a very religious family. I had high hopes, but was utterly disappointed. Greg Kinnear was great in it, though."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "Keep it to the religious, who believe in this god thing. And keep it away from those who aren't. My family is religion, so I was forced to watch this hunk of garbage."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "If I had not read the book I might have found myself with a different opinion of the film. Expectations for the movie weren't very high, as they aren't high for any book to movie transition. The acting was verging on B rated besides Greg Kinnear's performance witch was very well played. I came away from Heaven is for real disappointed and wishing more had come out of such a great live to tell story. The movie felt weak in structure and spotty with well thought out dialogue. I might add that I loved the book, but felt the movie fell short. Heaven Is for Real is an attempt at influencing people towards Christianity, that was rained on by distracting characters and a poor written script."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Heaven is for Real doesn't try and apologize for what it is. It's a story that says: \"Whether you believe this or not, here it is\". As far as the structure of the movie itself went, it started off quite fast paced and seemed to rush quickly through a lot of the parts that were more drawn-out in the book. An example is when Colton goes to hospital - in the book, this was told in much more detail, and showed the gradual increase in Colton's sickness, right up to the point where Colton goes to hospital. In the movie however, the hospital scene seems to come out of no where and is rushed through extremely quickly, creating much less of an impact compared to if there was more of an emphasis here.\r I can say though, where the film lacked here, it made up for in the scenes with Colton's descriptions about Heaven. These scenes were some of the highlights of the film, and they just seemed to flow better in the way that they occurred compared to the book which felt more like a ton of questions and answers (To be fair though, they were very interesting questions and answers). One thing that I also liked more about the movie than the book, was that it really showed the families struggles going through hard times with the Church. Colton's sudden descriptions of Heaven really fitted well with this idea as well.\r Overall, the Christian themes and values in the movie were something that everyone, Christian or not, should be able to relate to, and the story is one that I hope people will feel encouraged by, Christian or not, and for that reason, I recommend this movie to everyone."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "I saw the movie opening night before a theater which was about 80% full.  The slowly developing story pulls on your heartstrings as a the cutest 4 YO little boy survives a near death experience in the operating room.  He then slowly starts to tell his father he was in heaven, had an out of body experience, and describes what he saw.  What is lacking is a detailed account of that experience as there was so much more that could have been presented.  It's certainly a feel good story that we all want to believe.  The true life hero is now a teenager and was recently interviewed by Bill O'Reilly.  Once again he spoke in a narrative summary without giving specific details as he was totally unconvincing.  Still a nice movie."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Dumb. Boring. Pointless. Illogical. The only evidence we have to believe is what a little kid says.

I have met members of the Burpo family - great family and truth is truth.  Movies are made to please mass audiences.  Read the book - it is truly life-changing.  It is an awesome reinforcement for Christians all over the world.  Praying for the non-believers."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Having read and loving Todd Burpo\u2019s best-selling true story HEAVEN IS FOR REAL, about his four-year-old son, Colton, and his near-death experience in which he was seemingly given a vivid glimpse of heaven, and then finding out later that the book was being adapted into a major motion picture, I had high hopes that perhaps Hollywood might get this one right. However, I couldn\u2019t help but fear the worst that like almost all other well-intentioned, but under-financed faith-based films produced on low budgets, HEAVEN IS FOR REAL would ultimately end up being just another cinematic sham.  Imagine then my heightened optimism when A-list, Oscar-nominated actor Greg Kinnear (AS GOOD AS IT GETS) was snagged to play Burpo and that the film was being directed (and its story adapted to the big-screen) by Oscar-nominated screenwriter Barry Wallace (BRAVEHEART).\r Those that loved the best-selling book (over 8 million in paperbacks and eBooks sold) will be pleasantly surprised and greatly relieved to know that screenwriter Wallace has done a masterful job of bringing this touching and inspiring true story to the big screen. That is not to say that the 100-minute film has much (if any) chance of swaying skeptics into accepting the existence of heaven and Jesus Christ as the keeper of the keys. However, Wallace has confidently and faithfully truncated the source material into a movie that more than captures the spirit of the book. With a brilliant marketing move of an Easter weekend release, the film is already a huge hit with Christian filmgoers, and may even become a cross-over success with other film audience demographic categories as well. Despite mixed reviews from film critics (48/100 on Metacritic.com) Sony Pictures is reportedly thrilled with the surprise opening success of the film, with it already earning nearly $30 million, more than doubling its $12 million budget in just five days. Couple those figures with the strong word-of-mouth buzz from the opening weekend movie-goers, and it appears that HEAVEN IS FOR REAL may have much stronger legs than anyone had ever expected.\rKinnear\u2019s performance in HEAVEN IS FOR REAL may very well be his very best to date, as Todd Burpo, a hard-working, vastly underpaid pastor having to find multiple jobs to support his family and serve his community as a volunteer fireman as well. Kinnear brings such sincerity, nobility, and gentle humor to his role that one can\u2019t help but root for him to pull his family through the turmoil that these unsolicited revelations have caused.  It will be interesting to see if Hollywood will acknowledge Kinnear\u2019s work here come award season. Although I feel that he is deserving (so far) for a Best Actor nomination, its still early in the year, and the competition will undoubtedly get tough as the fall releases begin to come out. It may also be too much for Hollywood to be able to give such obvious recognition to a low-budget, faith-based film, though it would not be breaking a precedent to do so. Anyone remember Sidney Poitier\u2019s Oscar win for LILIES OF THE FIELD (1963) or Robert Duvall\u2019s for TENDER MERCIES (1983)?\rKinnear\u2019s excellent performance is also enhanced when sharing the screen with six-year-old newcomer, Connor Corum, as Colton. Wallace (putting on his director\u2019s hat) picked young Corum out from a nationwide casting call and was specifically looking for a boy who could speak with \u201can absolutely honest and open heart.\u201d Kinnear and Corum\u2019s scenes together are so very natural and believable that I was taken back to the Oscar-nominated performances of Dustin Hoffman and (then) six-year-old Justin Henry in KRAMER VS. KRAMER (1979). Though Kelly Reilly as Connor\u2019s mom and Todd\u2019s wife is clearly the weak casting link in the film (her scenes, whether with Kinnear and/or Corum, or not, never really ring true) the film is blessed with strong supporting roles by Oscar-nominee Thomas Haden Church (SIDEWAYS) as Todd\u2019s best friend, and Margo Martindale (AUGUST: OSAGE COUNTY) as a skeptical and concerned church board member. Both of these well-recognized actors add great credibility to the otherwise unknown and less experienced cast. The film\u2019s cinematography, helmed by Oscar-winner, Dean Semler (DANCES WITH WOLVES) is gorgeous, and tasteful throughout, especially when depicting heavenly angels floating in bright sunlit, puffy clouded skies, and during the Rockwell-like farmland landscapes of Nebraska (actually shot in Ontario). However, besides Reilly\u2019s unconvincing portrayal as Sonja, another weak point in the film is its original music score which is rather bland and formulaic, and is out-classed by the handful of contemporary worship songs sprinkled throughout the movie that are far more supportive.

Really feel for the guy, as a person who does not have that experience (but sure would like it I bet). He's preaching this stuff, believing in it in some way, but his son lived and saw it with no intent of preaching it or validating.\rIn summary, worth a rent on a rainy day.

Throughout the plot, the existence of life after death is taken as a certainty, with scientific explanations being (purposely) unreliable, which makes it hardly suitable for those who don't believe in it. Despite the unfortunate evangelical propaganda, the film presents an interesting problem, valid to any religion or belief system: it confront adults with their own beliefs using a child, reinforcing the idea of \u200b\u200binnocence, as if a child were unable to lie. Adults say they believe in some things but are always doubting and are unable to deal with any evidence, even if it support their beliefs. That denounces some hypocrisy underlying most religions, including the one who sponsored the film. This is interesting to see and take away some of the propagandistic load that permeates the film, full of feelings but avoiding being corny. I don't know anyone from the cast, but they did a decent job. However, this movie is not a dramatic show. Its worth for it's story and the problem it brings, even if it's spoiled by partiality and religious propaganda."}], "recommendations": ["overcomer", "i_can_only_imagine", "courageous", "pay_it_forward", "risen", "the_giver", "slumdog_millionaire", "soul_surfer", "miracles_from_heaven", "war_room", "the_butterfly_effect", "babel", "hereafter", "i_still_believe", "revolutionary_road", "collateral_beauty", "son_of_god", "the_book_thief", "hotel_rwanda", "bridge_to_terabithia", "facing_the_giants", "woodlawn", "the_adjustment_bureau", "the_pursuit_of_happyness", "machine_gun_preacher"]}
