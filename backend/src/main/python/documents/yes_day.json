      "text": "The plot is just preposterous, but if you find yourself passing through that threshold, you may be more understanding of what this movie is trying to do, which is just family entertainment of the forgettable kind.Although the most ironic thing of all, is that in this story, the adults are forced to accept whatever crazy stuff their children come up with, and basically the story teaches you - despite being permissive with them - Why, from time to time, you have to say no.Although perhaps that's the lesson, and I only imagined the irony.Another Netflix filler."

Como deixar uma menina de 14 anos pensar em ir a um festival de m\u00fasica? O filme \u00e9 um conjunto de cenas rid\u00edculas com, com piadas for\u00e7adas e sem gra\u00e7a, seria um filme rid\u00edculo at\u00e9 mesmo para o Adam Sandler, uma perda de tempo!"

      "text": "Rather unoriginal, though the cast make it more likeable than it would otherwise be.'Yes Day' is exactly what it says on the tin, you will not be shocked to find out what the plot is. It plays out in the most predictable way possible, even the hearty moments are a little too sickly at times. With that said, there are some minor decent bits.Jennifer Garner (Allison) and \u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez (Carlos) work well enough together, though Garner definitely stands out more. Jenna Ortega (Katie) does alright in her role, one that isn't too dissimilar to Isabela Merced's in 'Instant Family' - as is the whole film, in actual fact. 'Yes Man', ft. Jim Carrey, also holds slight similarities as you might expect. Both those films are far better, fwiw.Not one I'll be revisiting, but I could see families in particular having a fine time with this. Each to their own, of course."
