On the upside, the cast was the strongest aspect, with the three main leads Seth Rogen, Rose Byrne, and Zac Efron all very funny and enjoyable once again. However, I can't say the same for the addition of Chloe Grace Moretz, whose talent felt sadly wasted in such an idiotic role.

Don't fix it!), but this time it's a sorority who've moved into the vacant property. Lead by the gorgeous Chloe Moretz, these girls want to party as hard as the boys, but without having to 'put out' in order to get into the frat-house parties.\rWith their own home in 'escrow' for 30 days, Rogan and Byrne (along with their two friends) must try to keep the new buyers from finding out they will be living next to a party house!\rZac Efron returns, initially working with the girls to get their house in order (so they can pay the rent... Although nothing is mentioned about other financial outgoings, and none of the girls seem to do any studying!!), but eventually switches sides due to the girls kicking him out when he's outlived his usefulness....\r Cue some familiar gags recycled from the first movie, as well as some decent enough new ones.\r It's a decent enough sequel to a better than average original, but it lacks that 'punch' the first film had. This is mainly down to avoiding the sexuality of the girls. In the original film, the overt masculinity of the frat-boys was really pushed into your face, but in the sequel the director/writers have gone to great lengths to not make the girls into physical objects.\rSo copious drug taking, cool... Using spent tampons as a (rather disgusting) weapon against their neighbours, yes they do that.....

They were so desperate for laughs it wasnt funny(pun intended). The awkward silence in the audience exemplified that! One last thing the disgusting scenes. spoiler alert*** Periods thrown at the window, puking in the face while having sex and the toddler playing with **** was **** forced, gross and stupid.

In fact, I've never reviewed anything on metacritic before and had to create this account (and go through an email verification). This is the most painful movie I've ever seen. The movie is the most unfunny comedy I've ever had the displeasure of paying money for; it's more political than The Interview, less intelligent than than a Larry the Cable Guy feature film, and more awkward than the juvenile  imbeciles featured in the movie (and I don't just mean the 18-year-old girl antagonists). While the movie occasionally tries to mix up some stereotypes for a genuinely funny moment, it is consistently and swiftly ruined by bad acting and writing. If you mind the hospital bill from the self inflicted gouges in your eyes and the  long waits between any genuinely funny moment (and the fact that you'd have to live with spending ~$10 on this piece of propaganda for the rest of your life), then this movie is probably not for you. If, for some reason, you are a masochistic and want to mix up the usual physical pain for psychological instead, then is movie is for you. Usually my friends and I can make any movie funny by providing some color commentary among our group, but this movie is so blatantly awful that even 7 close friends could not make the best of it.

It is the sequel to the surprisingly good and successful Neighbors that came out in 2014. This one has old and new faces on the casting side, with returning names like Seth Rogen, Zac Efron and Rose Byrne, plus new cast members such as the amazingly talented Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz on the sorority side, with her new \"sisters\" that are played by Kiersey Clemons and Beanie Feldstein.\rOverall I quiet enjoyed this movie, and in my opinion it is even funnier and better than the first one. The overall casting choices are perfect, and while the old cast is still incredibly funny and likable, Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz totally steals the show in my opinion. She's so darn likable and definitely delivers the perfect one-liners that are super funny. Her character is also likable and interesting at the same time. Zac Efron is also a casting choice that really impressed me on the first Neighbors, and while he was funny on that movie, in this one he just takes it to a whole new level. I pretty much have liked this guy in every movie he's been in so far in his career. He certainly has comedic talent and I hope he keeps on doing what he's doing.\rSure some of the jokes and story-lines of this movie feel like a deja-vu from the first movie, but I think that this is just a trend for comedy sequels now. Repeating the same things from the first movie is something that many other comedy sequels have done recently, like Ted 2 and 22 Jump Street. But it worked for both of them and it works for this one too.\rI really liked this movie, and while it is not comedic gold or a classic, it isn't trying to be either. It is a fun and enjoyable summer movie with some great messages about friendship and family thrown in there to make the perfect balance, and in my opinion, a good comedy movie."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Neighbors 2 delivers on what you paid for: to be a laugh-out loud movie, and it delivers.

Better than the first in almost every way. Takes advantage of being a sequel in almost every way. Are some of the really good jokes in the trailer? Yes. Is it still worth seeing? Oh yes. Yes yes yes."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Rogen, Stoller, Byrne, and Efron return with a follow up to the 2014 comedy hit. Like most seemingly unnecessary comedy sequels, It's still possible to appreciate Sorority Rising, but in it's attempts to be bigger and all around better than it's predecessor, it falls short because it tries too hard. There are still plenty of laughs to be had here and this is more than just the same old, same old with a gender swap.There's actually a pretty good idea at the core of this. Not only do we get to enjoy more of Neighbors' humor, but there is a solid message of feminism running throughout (the kind we actually need!). Obviously that's going to offend the simple minded and maybe those who have been misled into believing that the crap these Youtube and other internet personalities is selling is actual feminism, and therefore are turned off by the simple mention of it.While the message is significant to the times, I do find fault with it's presentation. Simply put, this movie is about as subtle as a sledgehammer. The message is fine, but it does sort of have a way of preaching at you every now and then. Some tact would have gone a long way and made things easier to swallow for the more close-minded out there.Anyways, enough about the movie's agenda. The main question one should be asking themselves is if whether or not it is funny. The answer is yes, just not as funny as the first Neighbors. Like I said, it tries too hard. As a result some gags are just too over the top and cartoonish. The results are usually still amusing, but nowhere near the gut-busting level of hilarity the original's had. Sorority Rising has some heart backing things up as well. Themes of parenthood, sisterhood, and brotherhood are all important themes of the movie that remind us that at the end of the day it sucks being alone and so we need to cherish those around us.Surprisingly the best part of the movie isn't the back and forth antics/power struggle Rogen and Byrne have with their neighbors. It's watching Efron's \"Teddy\" find himself and come to terms with growing up. I've said it once and I'll say it again, Efron is an underappreciated comedic talent. He brings a lot of the movie's biggest laughs and sweetest moments. I'd be up for watching a spin-off with just him.Overall Sorority Rising is about what you would expect from a comedy sequel. The characters return and we get to relive the original's humor with new antics. However, it's not as fresh or funny this time around. A solid message and some new jokes do still make it watchable though. So if you were a fan of the original you should still like this one, because at the end of the day it's just funny to watch the young and stupid battle the old and stupid."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Doesn't quite come away with the same amount of laughs or originality that came from the first one but at face value, Neighbors 2 does exactly what it sets out to do. The charm of the first movie is still ever present in Seth Rogan, Rose Byrne and Zac Efron but the movie ultimately fumbles on itself trying to do too much by heavily relying on outdated gags and nods that made the original what it was. What also hurt the movie in my opinion was that it felt like some sort of vehicle for Chloe Grace Moretz to further her career as an adult, but her acting instead comes off as forced, annoying and needless as a antagonist when compared to Teddy from the first one."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "There are a couple of laugh-out-loud funny moments (two to be exact), but its not enough to rescue this movie.

Its nauseously politically correct, and for a comedy that doesn't work at all. Its overly preachy and not very funny, not a good formula for a comedy.

Although the returning cast members provide some amusement, the female additions aren't especially quirky or fun, which means they don't add any laffs.

I thought only people are reacting negatively, it could be much better than the previous one, but this is really a crap. I'm as a film fanatic hate myself to criticise a film like a film critic does, but there is no other option. I don't know who are the target audience, because it was too sexy for teens and definitely adults won't enjoy unless they are similar to what in the film depicted.\r I don't know why, but I disliked all film with Zac Efron in it. Beside, I'm disappointed in Chloe Grace joining this team. A bad decision, she will regret doing it in the future, maybe she's already. Regarding Seth and Byrne, I don't blame them doing this, at least theirs part were much better than the others. Yet there is no laughs, the film ran with totally dry. Maybe the youngsters would enjoy it than anybody else, because I'm sure the grown-up have already seen better ones in the similar style in the 80s and 90s.\r I hope this is it, no more sequels. Particularly not to end up like 'American Pie', but nobody can stop that if B filmmakers take over from here on. At least first film was much better compared between these two. If you are an adult, sure you should skip it. Zac and Chloe won the Teen Choice awards, so now you know who should watch it.

They are planning to sell their house and move elsewhere, as they plan to move within the upcoming 30 days, they discover that they have another set of new neighbors moving in. We meet three college girls; Shelby (Chloe Grace-Moretz), Beth (Kiersey Clemons) and Nora (Beanie Feldstein) who plan to host a sorority club in that house which involves loud parties and a large group of girls getting together and causing chaos.\r Mac and Kelly obviously try to reason with these girls that they can wait 30 days until they move and then host these loud parties. However, the girls get help from Mac and Kelly's former enemy, Teddy (Zac Efron).\r Just like with the previous film, there were moments that made me laugh, however, all of the characters in these movies are so exaggerated to the point of absurdity, I don't believe them as actual human beings. In fact, despite that Rogen and Byrne have chemistry together, I often wonder why they stay together in the first place. Byrne's character comes off as the kind of woman who would separate herself from Mac because of these situations that they land themselves in.\r The movie also tries too hard to be an R-Rated comedy with some crude jokes that feel organic and are timed perfectly, but then there are other crude jokes that just appear early and often, and they feel forced just to get that R-Rating in there.\r It may not be the most expected sequel, but for me, it's more or less the same as the first."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Well, it's no better or worse than the original Neighbors.
