But the kills weren't as inventive as previous films and there are only so many times you can light a trail of gasoline. The final death was really really uninventive but there were so great moments, especially the escalator and the car wash. This gets a 7 with 3D, but it gets a 5 without it."

Don't bother with the 3D as it was seemingly added as an afterthought and was almost entirely unnoticeable. Though my forehead was raw from slapping it every time a ceiling fan (or entire structure for that matter) was just one loose screw from starting an impossibly ridiculous Rube Goldberg device of death, the over the top gory deaths were mildly humorous in execution (pun intended). It goes from bad to worse in the closing scene when the writers apparently ran out of time or had to make another beer run, and decided to wrap this up in the most uninspired way possible. If you ever do see this movie, I'd recommend putting it on in the background while shooting the breeze with a few buddies and muting the bored sounding frat boys and girls to a indistinguishable buzz. Oh and definitely don't pay eight bucks for it."

Aside from a somewhat entertaining opening bloodbath, this movie falls flat quick regardless of it being in 3D. The acting is a wreck from everyone involved. Some instances were so ludicrous it would leave you baffled. The main characters are shown absolutely unphased that one of their close friends had just died in the previous scene and hardly ever refer to the incident afterward. Really? Any heart or sentiment that was attempted to be injected into the movie on behalf of the security guard's character seemed forced and fake. What is enjoyable about this movie however is how much you'll be laughing if you just accept the movie's absurdity. I honestly haven't laughed as hard this year during any other movie, but seeing as \"comedy\" isn't an applicable genre, the unintentional sdiesplitting situations will leave a sour taste in your mouth when the whole dreadful ride is over. Skip it."

      "text": "Artistry redeems any subject matter, some say(in particular, Roger Ebert), so even a junky horror movie like this franchise's immediate predecessor can achieve a moderate level of greatness, which is no small feat, since the filmmaker has to abide by a constrictive narrative that's both rote and pedestrian. People died in \"Final Destination 3\", but they died with undeniable pizazz, especially during the opening sequence at the amusement park involving a derailed rollercoaster. The build-up was terrific, truly suspenseful; a nifty piece of filmmaking that set the tone for more infectious, degenerate fun. To die under the helm of a skillful filmmaker, arguably, is not to die in vain, as Ebert says, artistry redeems any subject matter, so by definition, not all hyper-violent movies, horror, in particular(his quote was attributed to John Carpenter's \"Halloween\"), are categorically not without redemption. But \"Final Destination 3\" was a rare exception. Conversely, the opening sequence of this franchise's follow-up is nothing but cheap thrills, en route to more cheap thrills without artistry. In \"The Final Destination\", there's nothing to finesse the formulaic story, in which each new plot point will be, more or less, the same as the last one: some crueler and bloodier than others, and all with the same tedious chain reaction set-up. Despite all the stupid teenagers and stupider montages, the film does contain one transcendent moment. Whereas Quentin Tarantino(\"Inglourious Basterds\") is charged with not being serious about the Holocaust in some quarters, the same could be said about the movie's evocation of civil rights movement narratives, in which an avenging redneck(the film stereotypes NASCAR's fanbase), whose racist act towards the black security guard is thwarted by fate, plays like a goof on Alan Parker's \"Mississippi Burning\", and other movies of its ilk."

There was hardly any redeaming characteristics to any of the characters who were in death's way to care what happened to them except for George (poor Williams) and perhaps Nick's girlfriend, Lori (who does get the most inventive death, and to me, personally most scariest of the deaths, but even that is revealed as being in a premonition). Agreed with other 'expert' reviews that the 3-D added nothing. The direction was poor, at best, and the writing was horrendous and very tepid (a 3rd grader could have written it). The acting was equally horrendous, with the lead Bobby Campo the worst (his character of Nick had the worst to non-existent reaction to the original premonition I've seen of the four movies in this franchise). What a waste of my money, too bad I didn't have a premonition about that."

It's definitely better then David R Ellis first crack at the FD franchise with FD2 but lacks some of the flair that David Wong has in FD1+3. In saying that this film is more lively and gorey but less on the horror/thriller side of things. 3D works well in some places and in other places it falls flat on its face and is used a cop out for a decent scene. I really enjoyed this movie but as a real major fan of FD I did feel some of the deaths were dissapointing and that mini visions instead of subtle hints in shadows etc were abit of a cop out. Hopefully we get another FD soon with David Wong back on board directing and the original writers."
