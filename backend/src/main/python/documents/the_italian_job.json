Along with a drop-dead gorgeous safecracker, Croker and his team take off to re-steal the loot and end up in a pulse-pounding, pedal-to-the-metal chase that careens up, down, above and below the streets of Los Angeles.",

      "text": "The first half hour of this remake is great fun. I especially enjoyed seeing Donald Sutherland. I lost interest after that. Things immediately flagged in the second act, which shifted focus almost exclusively to Mark Wahlberg, a despicable human being who I have a hard time watching in anything. A violent and repeat criminal who blinded a man in one eye in a vicious attack. Why is this guy not in prison? He also just doesn't have charisma the way movie stars should. Do women find him sexy? If so, I don't know why. Charlize Theron played an uninteresting character cliche, and for a woman who looks incredibly sexy in still photos, she was somehow utterly unsexy in motion here. It was as if she didn't care, but was just reading lines. I know she can act, but here she just had no intensity and no passion, no charisma. I just couldn't maintain my interest and stopped watching about 40 minutes in. Listen, maybe the movie got great the second after I turned it off, but one has to make decisions based on the information one has. The information I had told me I was wasting my time. Someone needs to make a movie starring Donald Sutherland again, rather than just using him as a minor supporting player. That guy knows what he's doing."

In the UK its call 'The Italian Job: LA Heist' and from this I wish it was just called 'LA Heist'. The story is not all that bad. Its fairly generic but engaging. Most of the parts in the film are played well and I did think the cast was good. The only real reason that this is The Italian Job is through the choice of cars (New BMW MINIS). The plot moves at a decent pace and has plenty of set pieces, action moments along with some emotions (these feel a little obvious and fairly predictable) but its not a bad way to spend an hour and a half.\rThe ending is a little cheap for me but its not the worst you will ever see.\rRent rather than buy."

There is a lack of life in the characters (?) and  relationships that makes it just a factory made cliche. The part with Sutherland is slightly better."

It intrigues the viewer, it gets you to root for the good guys and against the bad guy, and you are left amazed at how crafty these guys really are as they get what they want. The cast was really good; Wahlberg, Theron, and Norton, all turned in good performances as expected. Overall, it's certainly a movie I'd recommend to people as there's not much wrong with it."

I can't pick out any particular reason for the disappointment.  The heist is interesting, and it is always a pleasure to see non-CGI action scenes, but the movie just wasn't fun.  Maybe it is just less enjoyable after learning all of the twists in the story.  I give it a C - If you\u2019ve already seen all of the A\u2019s and B\u2019s, but you insist on seeing a movie, try this one out"

      "text": "Really has nothing to do with the original film except, you know, the main characters are all criminals.The original was a straight caper flick.  Every scene was either leading up to or leading away from the Great Crime of the Century and when it's all over our moral standards are rescued from enjoying a film in which the bad guys actually get away with the crime.In the remake, we start off with a crime, then a betrayal, and from that a tale of revenge, which consumes 85-90% of the runtime.  We do some boating in Venice, but that's about it for Italy.  We visit something that could be Switzerland, but then it's on to LA for most of the film.  And, yes, we do get a trio of Mini Coopers, and a computer whiz who does amazing things with traffic control, but that's about all the remake has in common with the original.And, basically, this film is just as silly as the original.  Just as silly as James Bond and a thousand other action fantasies.  I mean, the main characters could walk in, blow away their betrayer, and take back the gold, but how much more satisfying it would be to plan a whole big Mission Impossible style heist to steal the gold, which the betrayer naturally discovers, and then concoct a big bang-up finale in which some evil third party takes the betrayer prisoner and promises to torture him to death.  And that way we're saved from being forced to recognize that the bad guys, the criminals, have won, and we're swimming through a movie with a moral compass that only Donald Trump could love.It's possible I missed it, I guess, but I don't remember ever finding out who got ripped off for the gold in the first fifteen minutes of the film.And the romance scenes were just bleh."

Unlike the Ocean's crew, these guys not only do things in the most un-slick, non subtle way possible, but they leave gaping holes in the plan and just make bad choices. Like having the gang leader's daughter spy on the antagonist as a cable repairwoman. Really? You don't think he might have seen her before, working with him all those years?If you can set aside all the logic problems, it's a fun movie with a great pulse. Edward Norton is always awesome, even as a sniveling bad guy. But intelligent this movie is not."

      "text": "The Italian Job turned out to be better than I expected. Looking through the cast I was worried that the director was relying on the ensemble of heavyweight actors to carry the film, but dialogue and story-wise, The Italian Job wasn't bad at all. There's a lot of unnecessary filler scenes in the middle third, and the director/editor could have easily cut out a good ten-fifteen minutes. As pointed out by a few users, Edward Norton is fairly disappointing as the film's villain among villains, and I would've preferred to see him cast as the lead man. That being said, Mark Wahlberg does a surprisingly good job, not overplaying the role. The supporting cast, particularly Mos Def and Jason Statham, lend some comic relief and and give an all-round solid performance. There's a heap of implausible moments in The Italian Job, so much so that I was scoffing at times at the ludicrousness of it all, but it's to be expected from a high-adrenaline action film."

I don't think it's a great film though. It's too gimmicky and lacking focus or the wow factor, but it's a good action film that won't dissapoint."

Gary Gray's \"The Italian Job\" gets things done and then some, offering up well-designed set pieces, admirable plotting and thrilling camerawork in lieu of an exact, shot-for-shot approach in addressing the 1969 caper. The iconography is there (i.e. the Mini Coopers, the Venetian canals, etc.) but this time around, you're also treated to early 2000's humor, early 2000's technology and early 2000's Marky Mark. It's kitschy as all hell, but charming in a weird, admittedly nostalgic way. Kind of a wonder (and a bummer) that I haven't seen this one earlier."

I just love a good heist movie, doesn't everyone? Its smart, funny, interesting, engrossing, and bad ass. The movie was very well acted, but one guy stole the show as the funniest character in the movie and that's Seth Greens character, he was funny, he had witty dialogue, an awesome back story that added realism to his character. But everyone else is awesome too. If you like realistic heist movies, you will like this movie. And if you don't like heist movies in general, you may like it but you won't love it."

It's an entertaining film, it certainly is, but that's really al it is. The script is predictable and filled with plot-holes as you expect with films like this, the acting isnt good, nor is it bad, no one in particular stands out, Edward Norton maybe, he plays a cool villain, but in the opening scene of the film (and knowing the general synopsis of the film beforehand) you instantly know he was going to be the one to betray them, with his scary face and the moustache.\rThe film has cool ideas, despite having seen them all done before a hundred times, it has impressive set pieces, car/boat chases, good locations and a stellar cast. The way it was executed reminded me in a good way of Fast Five/Furious Six/ and Furious Seven. The same style of a rag-tag team planning a big heist, with car chases, lots of money, and just a great time watching\r All in all ''The Italian Job'' is certainly an entertaining flick, but extremely conventional, predictable, same with the characters."
