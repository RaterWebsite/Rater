      "text": "Either I have been going to the movies far too long (80 years) or I have become jaded--maybe a combination of both!I've seen at least a dozen different films in this genre with one of my favorites being \"Murder On The Orient Express\" with Ingrid Bergman and Lauren Bacall . It was an Agatha Christie movie made with a group of stars revolving around who committed a murder. In this case the screenplay and direction is by Rian Johnson which brings in some current hot topics like immigrants with references to Lin-Manuel Miranda  and a snippet of a song by Steven Sondheim among other things.The story is basically about patriarch Harlan Thrombey, played by  Christopher Plummer, has become a multimillionaire by writing novels. We meet him at his 85th birthday on the night before he  accidentally killed himself or was accidentally killed by  his Latina immigrant nurse Marta, whose mother is here illegally. She is played by Ana de Armas who, as Marta, is filled with kindness and always throws up when she tells a lie.In the cast are Daniel Craig who appears as  private detective Blanc, hired secretly, and uses a horrible southern accent without reason, Jamie Lee Curtis as Harlan's daughter Linda, married to Don Johnson and they are the parents of 'Ransom' played by Chris Evans. Curtis gives the best performance in the movie,Michael Shannon as Walt is Harlan's youngest son, is married to Riki Lindhome, playing Donna, and they have a child, Jacob, played by Jaeden Martell, who is sort of an 'odd' bird. Toni Collette is Harlan's daughter-in-law who was married to his deceased son and Harlan's granddaughter  Megan, played by Katherine Langford. The latter's character was completely unnecessary to the movie and whose major scene could have been cut without an effect one way or the other except cutting the film down to a 2 hour running time.Lakeith Stanfield and Noah Segan are detectives involved in the mystery who seem to allow Craig's detective take charge though it really doesn't make sense that they do.Three other characters are played by Edi Patterson as Fran, Harlan's housekeeper and K Callan as Wanetta, Harlan's mother---remember Harlan is 85!---and Frank Oz as Harlan's lawyer.The only interesting aspect to me was the Gothic house which has layers of hidden doors, windows and rooms and when you see all the things in the house you will feel sorry for the poor housekeeper!\"Knives Out\" was a disappointment to me but in the film's defense most critics seemed to love it!"

      "text": "What\u2019s been part of the fun of following Rian Johnson\u2019s career over the last 15 years is seeing just which genre Johnson will choose to tackle next. Ever since his debut, Rian Johnson has proven himself as a scholar of genre filmmaking; showing not only a keen knowledge of the rules each genre but how to update them. Sometimes this was trading the seedy nightclubs and political offices of 40\u2019s noir for the lunchroom tables of different social cliques as in \u2018Brick\u2019 or updating the social politics of a galaxy far far away in \u2018Star Wars: The Last Jedi\u2019. Rian Johnson has always found a way to tell new stories in the medium of something old-fashioned. Knives Out, his latest, repeats this trick to perhaps its greatest effect yet.Knives Out is in a lot of ways a classic whodunnit, it follows an eccentric detective, Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig, reprising his Southern drawl from \u2018Logan Lucky\u2019) as he investigates the death of a wealthy crime fiction novelist, Harlan Thrombley (Christopher Plummer), and questions the family of suspects who could have murdered him. Rian Johnson\u2019s film pays homage to the work of Agatha Christie with every staple that Christie purists could hope for, - the larger-than-life cast of suspects, the old ornate Victorian home, the big reveal scene where our brilliant detective puts everything together - and yet Knives Out feels completely fresh.What Knives Out does is update the whodunnit genre to make is distinctly American and show what our society looks like in a post-Trump world. Rian Johnson\u2019s film in a lot of ways is not too different from Jordan Peele\u2019s \u2018Get Out\u2019, as a genre film that\u2019s a trojan horse, in this case to talk about class and privilege in America. Similar to Peele\u2019s film, Knives Out also shows a boldness in calling out the hypocrisies and ignorance of those on both sides of the political aisle. As we meet character after character in the Thrombley family, each is eager to proudly claim full credit for their own personal success while comically defensive of how they obtained it. Meanwhile the film juxtaposes this with the character of Marta, (Ana de Armas) Harlan\u2019s caretaker, a young hard-working Latina woman who perhaps was the only one who truly cared about Harlan. Throughout the film, the Thrombleys continue to tell Blanc how Marta is just like family to them while we see her constantly condescended and ignored. A very sharp reoccurring joke even features each Thrombley with a completely different answer (Ecuador, Uruguay, Brazil) for where they think Marta\u2019s family immigrated from. The way these distinctions Rian Johnson creates in class and privilege only deepen as the central mystery reveals itself creates a keenly observed snapshot of our contemporary culture. In some ways, this may actually be Johnson\u2019s greatest homage to Agatha Christie, as she too, was an author who used her work to also critique the society of her era.Knives Out has a distinct sense of tone unique for the genre. While the whodunnit has seen several serious adaptation like \u2018Murder on the Orient Express\u2019 and \u2018Death on the Nile\u2019, and camp parodies like \u2018Clue, and \u2018Murder by Death\u2019 - Johnson\u2019s film falls somewhere right between. Knives Out is a film that takes its mystery and air of suspense seriously, but has fun undercutting it by finding the comedy in it\u2019s heightened characters and ridiculous circumstances. In a lot of ways it\u2019s a similar approach to genre that his contemporary Edgar Wright (who even gets a small shout out) has taken in the past with films like \u2018Shaun of the Dead\u2019 and \u2018Hot Fuzz. These are films with a deep regard toward their genre and influences looking to create something in their tradition while finding a new comedic take on it.It feels somewhat perfect that Knives Out would be released on Thanksgiving, the film echoes the very conversations many Americans are having with their families around dinner tables this week but manages to illustrate them in the most entertaining way possible. It\u2019s no hyperbole to say that this film is one of the most fun experiences I\u2019ve had at the cinema in recent years. Rian Johnson\u2019s latest is a genre exercise that is thrilling, hilarious, and has more than a few things to say. Knives Out is not just the perfect entertainment for your holiday weekend, it\u2019s one of the best films of the year."

It has excellent acting from everyone, but the two biggest standouts, to me, were Ana de Armes and Chris Evans. Armes' performance was so real and fresh that there is an argument to be made that wasn't acting, and that was actually her as a person; and, you can tell Chris Evans had a lot of fun playing Ransom, and steering away from being Captain America (who he was phenomenal as) and getting to play a sarcastic douchebag. And, unlike a lot of recent whodunits, this movie actually had some very well-executed surprises (no spoilers). And, above all, this movie was hilarious, especially towards the end. Rian Johnson did a fantastic job on this movie. Don't let your hate for The Last Jedi get in the way of checking this movie out."

      "text": "As a murder-mystery, it doesn't come anywhere close to an Agatha Christie, or any of the other interesting whodunnits, there is one scene where one of the characters is watching Angela Lansbury in Murder, She Wrote on a TV and it just made me really cringe, there are other self-serving references where the writer/director shoves in political statements and other trite references, Rian Johnson is quite obviously his own biggest fan.There isn't much suspense at all, the movie plays out pretty much exactly as you think it will, it becomes obvious from early on who-dunnit and the characters are all caricatures, none give a nuanced and interesting performance. Daniel Craig fails at an American drawl accent and this is a distraction throughout the whole movie. They should have cast an American or a decent voice actor, or had him have an English accent. Ana de Armas has a large amount of screen time and does well playing the part, as the central figure she carries the film and its straightforward plot. Her central plot contrivance, that she is sick every time she lies, isn't used in an interesting way, it merely provides a convenience for the \"detectives\" who do almost zero actual detective work after the initial interviews at the very start of the film that establish characters and motives. All of this is wasted as the cast never become plausible suspects, there are only ever two suspects and one becomes obvious in the second act. There is none of the subtlety or misdirection of the classic murder mysteries.There are so many illogical plot holes and unnatural events that the film falls apart as a crime thriller, characters walk over, throw away, and destroy evidence in full view of the police, who say or do absolutely nothing about it. There are other inconsistencies, the hugest of which is the central overdose plot and a cover-up that wouldn't work as a cover-up after a post-mortem. Its watchable and entertaining enough to pass a couple of hours, but I wouldn't ever watch it a second time or rate it as a good murder mystery, as there is precious little mystery."

      "text": "Knives Out is a well directed movie that falls short of being a masterpiece because it thinks it is more clever than it is. This modern take on the class whodunit genre is refreshing and risky. By playing with a well established format, Johnson is able to create a film that kept me interested and entertained throughout. That is not to say that this a film for everyone. Members of the party I saw this film with found it to be inferior to past works in the genre.Where the film falls short for me is, as mentioned above, this movie thinks that it is very clever when in reality, it is not nearly as clever as it thinks it is. The twists are a bit predictable and that made for an underwhelming third act. Johnson's directing is for the most part great, but at times it feels like the film is giving the audience too many clues as to what is going on exactly.The biggest strength of this movie is its acting. Its ensemble cast makes for several great performances. Craig's and de Armas' in particular stand out to me. Johnson's script is serious when it needs to be while at the same time having comical elements that do not feel out of place. Having been disappointed by the way humor was implemented into Johnson's last film, The Last Jedi, I was very pleased to see a far more effective use of it in this film.Overall, I found Knives Out to be a very entertaining mystery film that was not afraid to play with the format of the class whodunit. The twists are a bit too obvious and the movie is not nearly as clever as it seems to think it is, but both of those factors did little to true damper by enjoyment of this film. While certain moviegoers may have problems with the writing or directing of this film, I would recommend it on the strength of the acting alone."

The problem is that it doesn't doing any one part of it particularly well.  It really isn't very funny and it really isn't that great a murder mystery.  There are several red herrings designed to mislead the audience but we have seen so much of that in the past that it isn't very effective.  You would not need to be an amazing detective to figure out the culprit by the midpoint of the movie.  Jamie Lee Curtis can be hilariously funny when given the right material and here she and others are criminally under used.  Much time is wasted on Ana De Armas who plays the nurse Marta.  The camera lingers on her face for far too long and far to often.  Combine that with Daniel Craig's painfully slow southern drawl, (which he does NOT nail) and I was often wishing the camera would follow what the more interesting characters were doing.And of course, being Hollywood, they can't help themselves from bashing Trump, Trump voters, and conservatives in general.  The couple in front of us walked out of the theater when things got particularly political about immigration and putting children in cages.To sum up, very few laugh out loud moments, very little real suspense, some annoying accents and politics, a lot of wasted potential and the result is a movie that will only be remembered for being forgettable.  Wait for it to show up on Netflix or something.  Not worth theater dollars."

What's more, a number of characters are seriously underused, and the script for what should be a timeless sort of tale is tarnished by discussions of contemporary topics that ground it in the present, diluting what should be one of the picture's chief defining characteristics. But the biggest issue is a big, gaping, vacuous question that's left unresolved at film's end, one that's sure to leave astute viewers scratching their heads.

It makes no sense to burn the laboratory, the corpse is not far. It makes no sense to dissuade Martha from returning the money. It makes no sense to blackmail Ransom, because there is no murder. It makes no sense to put different drugs in the same containers. It makes no sense to take fingerprints, because immediately everything will become clear. It makes no sense..."

      "text": "Let the mystery begin! When you sit down you kinda know what to expect if you watched the trailer, but at the same time you have no idea what's going to happen next. Whenever a question is answered in the story, another one right away arise.The story gives you the classic \"this is my main suspect\" phenomena to pick your guilty party when you conduct your own \"investigation\" during the dialogues, but obviously you can't be sure if you're right or wrong. Cleverly giving out clues during the story progression makes you realize that you may be wrong all along.I can't remember a period during the movie when I didn't have to pay attention. Everything the characters say and do on screen, adds up to the greater picture.Great cast and performance from all the actors involved. Excellent entertainment for 2 hours. Well written, great directing along with great music. If you want something different, I highly recommend to check this one out."

      "text": "Ignore any noise being spouted from jaded \u2018Star Wars\u2019 fanboys.  Rian Johnson is among the finest filmmakers currently working in Hollywood.Consider his resume: he wrote and directed \u2018Brick;\u2019 he wrote and directed \u2018The Brothers Bloom;\u2019 he wrote and directed \u2018Looper;\u2019 he directed the Breaking Bad episodes \u2018Fly,\u2019 \u2018Fifty-One,\u2019 and \u2018Ozymandias;\u2019 and most recently he wrote and directed easily the best murder-mystery of the year, \u2018Knives Out.\u2019The plot is dense and brilliantly serpentine\u2014just as one should expect from a quintessential film of the genre\u2014taking on the characteristics of an ouroboros.Each of the characters in the film are familiar, flawed, and driven by their own delightfully selfish motivations.But it\u2019s the writing\u2014oh the wonderful writing!\u2014that makes this picture as powerful and poetic as it is.  From the plot to the dialogue to the very last gasps of the denouement, Johnson keeps the audience completely rapt and on the edge of their seats wishing the saga could somehow continue ad infinitum."

      "text": "We've seen this before, many times. It was once called Clue, then it was done again quite brilliantly for it's time by Lumet. It was called Murder on the Orient Express that time around. This time, Rian Johnson gives you what he normally has to offer. Something pro looking for the people that just can't do the new-wave of cinema. This is a great film for people that don't like when movies just end (and need something bluntly climactic), getting annoyed at the open endings of 'No Country For Old Men', 'There Will Be Blood', any Spring Breakers, etc etc...  It might be stylized to the tune of a 2019 film, but just as in 'Brick', Johnson cannot for the life of him decide what kind of reality this takes place in. Is it ours? One might get the feeling that it's meant to be a hyper-realistic play on our reality with a little Hollywood action spice. Not a bad recipe if you do it right.  Johnson does not do it right.  This film, just like 'Brick' creates a reality that is surely having an identity crisis. Good angular editing with some imagery that is more so eye grabbing than it is specifically profound. Michael Shannon I feel is held back by the script. And Daniel Craig really could have pulled off something great if it wasn't so flat as a whole. I feel bad at the great work put in by some of these amazing actors, all falling flat on such a script. -  Another relic re-birthed for a new generation.  You might see it up for some hokey awards like the Oscars or Globes, ones that are televised and who's purpose is to rake in ratings (money). Alas it is too two dimensional to be winning things at Cannes or big time fests. This will be one of those films that will be on weekend non-cable channels all the time, in about 10 years. This is the type of movie I say might not be a waste of money, but it certainly won't cut the test of time. Go to Lumet for than.  Rian Johnson; another swing and a miss!"
