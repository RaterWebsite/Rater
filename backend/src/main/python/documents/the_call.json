Not only is this a nail-biting rescue, it becomes a police procedural as we watch the resources used to find the caller. Most of the time, the film makes smart choices that keep you involved and sometimes even wanting to scream at the screen. The filmmaking is sharp with some flashy editing touches and solid sound design. Even though the conclusion is a bit much, up til then, it's a well-crafted, gripping ride."

No cell signal where there was one in a previous scene, no cops at the location which they knew and was the only lead they had. They were there, but then left just before ms. 911 shows up and solves everything in 5 minutes flat. Oh and the last scene makes NO sense at all. Hal Berry is great, but the ending leaves you staring at the credits while you shake your head and wonder why the writers decided that was the best way to go out. Still giving it a 5 for everything up until the end. Don't watch this one people, you'll be disappointed..."

      "text": "Once you get past the unattractive Harpo Marx hairdo sported by Halle Berry in \u201cThe Call\u201d the first 80 minutes of this 98 film presents an interesting thriller before it becomes a cliche of previous thrillers. At that point it falls apart leaving more questions than answers but you really don\u2019t want to waste time trying to figure out what just happened.\r The screenplay by Richard D\u2019Ovidio sets up the story of 911 star operator Jordan (Halle Berry)  who makes a mistake and feels she is responsible for the death of a young kidnapped victim. Instead of continuing as an operator she now trains newcomers to the 911 center, known as \u2018The Hive\u2019 due to all the buzzing continuously going on of dispatchers answering phones with \u201c911, what is your emergency?\u201d and then following through to help solve them all from attempted suicides to a bat flying around in someone\u2019s house.  Jordan has a handsome police officer boyfriend, Paul Phillips, (Morris Chestnut) and with the help of some pills seems to have recovered from her previous experience only to once again be put in the same position. One of things she keeps telling the trainees is to never make promises to people on the other end of the line.\r Casey Wilson (Abigail Breslin) has been kidnapped in a mall garage by Michael Foster (Michael Eklund) who carries on in the Norman Bates, Hannibal Lecter and/or \u201cBuffalo Bill\u201d disturbed mode of killer. He puts her in the trunk of his car and using a cell phone, (What did thrillers use before cell phones?), she calls 911 and when the operator seems to be fumbling Jordan takes over. In most thrillers logic has to be parked at the door before the movie starts and this is no different but the various ways in which Jordan advises Casey and the sadistic actions of Michael as he travels Los Angeles highways and byways makes for gripping times in the film before it takes a wrong turn and makes the women action heroines.\r Berry does her usual efficient job while Breslin takes a huge step into being ready for adult roles  Eklund goes from a serious, sadistic killer to, at times, the script making him an object of ridicule. Michael Imperioli as an innocent victim brings an element of surprise as does Jose Zuniga.  The direction by Brad Anderson is more or less pedestrian while the music by John Debney plays with the emotions.\r \u201cThe Call\u201d is rated R with gratuitous violence, sex and language but being a good thriller the first 80 minutes before going off the tracks and falling into the mundane."

Once you know the antagonist's motive it becomes ludicrous that it become an episode of Criminal Minds.\r Brad Anderson is a good director, who did The Machinist and Transsiberian which were good thrillers; it's a shame he had to work with a script that doesn't know how to have a proper finale.\r Halle Berry doesn't even call the cops and instead goes vigilante on us. Once you think she manages to rescue the girl, the captive sugget to have the guy tied to a chair and lock him inside the hidden cellar. Sudden it has turned into a Hostel wannabe. This final act and ending ruined what could of been a tense thriller instead it becomes a 90-minute disappointed that doesn't give you a feeling of satisfaction."

Halle Berry makes this movie exceptionally convincing and delivers an emotional punch. I will warn you if you are suffering from anxiety you need not watch \"The Call.\" So many times I shifted forward in my seat in suspense, while biting my nails. Now with all of the positives this film does shove a few pins through my heart. 3/4 of the movie excels as a thriller, but in a blink of an eye were running upstairs when we should be running out the front door. The thriller quickly turns into a horror film and this is where the film loses me. We are given a \"Saw\" ending?! As the director, Brad Anderson had everything going for him, but gives up on the ending and it is extremely disheartening. In a nut shell \"The Call\" is a fun, outlandish, and suspenseful treat that is worthy of a matinee ticket."

      "text": "Labeling The Call as \"relentlessly dumb\" would be an overestimation of its intelligence. This is as brain-dead as a movie can be and it assumes the audience will have the I.Q. of a rutabaga. I suspected I might be in trouble when the opening credits proudly proclaim that The Call is a \"WWE Production.\" Uh-oh. Granted, I wasn't expecting a high-caliber art film (although, once upon a time, Brad Anderson was an indie director - The Machinist, anyone?) but the WWE isn't exactly known for gripping storylines and well-developed characters. The pedigree runs true.\r Things don't start out too badly. In fact, they begin with a whiff of verisimilitude. I don't know what a 911 call center looks like but I can believe it's something similar to what's shown in The Call. We're introduced to operator Jordan Turner (Halle Berry), who appears to be one of the best at what she does. Things take a turn for the worse for Jordan, however, when a caller is kidnapped as a result of a mistake Jordan makes. After the initial call is disconnected while the victim is hiding from her stalker, Jordan foolishly hits the \"dial back\" button and the ringing of the phone alerts the intruder to the girl's location. After this incident, Jordan takes herself off the active roster and becomes a 911 instructor - until she's pressed back into emergency duty.\r The Call goes off the rails as it approaches the climax. Once the call with Casey is terminated at a critical juncture, Jordan decides to take matters into her own hands. So, distrusting the police department's ability to get the job done, she goes on a one-woman hunt for the missing girl and, incredibly, finds her! Yes, she's a regular Ms. Sherlock Holmes. Then, upon discovering the psycho's lair, does she call for backup? No - she don't need no stinkin' backup! (The screenplay's lame attempt to provide logic for this decision is a laughably absurd.) Horror movie scream queens everywhere would welcome Jordan into their ranks. She commits all the classic idiot-blunders of those characters including the biggest one of all: turning her back on a supposed \"downed\" killer. Now, we all know that these guys always get up. Doesn't she watch Jason Michael Krueger movies?\r I am willing to credit The Call for one thing. In the sea of mediocre movies represented by the first quarter of the year, this successfully calls attention to itself by being just plain bad."

It's tense, brutal, features a original idea, and, up until the very end, has believable moments and characters who act and make decisions like real people would. I have to give special praise to Halle Berry who gives a fantastic performance rather than just relying on her looks. This is also do to the fantastic writing. The only real complaint I have is that near the films conclusion it takes the predictable turn of the main character going in to save the girl by herself. It's predictable and cliche, but doesn't hinder the overall movie. All in all I was highly impressed with \"The Call\" and recommend a watch."

      "text": "Despite a haircut that makes it look like some kind of small animal died on her head, Halle Berry is excellent in The Call, a tense thriller that was a genuine surprise, a smartly written and performed film. When Jordan (Berry) is responsible for the death of a young girl, she quits work as an emergency call operator but when another girl, Casey (Abigail Breslin) is taken she finds herself back in the chair trying to save her from her captor. The Call is a pulse pounding film as it playfully subverts horror conventions to create a thriller so tense that you may well feel your heart beating in your chest. Grounded by an excellent performance by Berry as the good natured but self conscious Jordan, everything in the film feels real adding a new level to the action as Breslin's Casey gets closer to her destination and her expected demise. The usual diversions are to be expected and an odd and slightly pointless cameo by Michael Imperioli slows the film down but all in all its a film with an interesting premise, two great central performances and an ability to play with the viewers head. The only real downside is the film's villain, he lacks the charisma of other horror villains and while the tension and terror is real, the ending is written on the walls from the beginning and it takes the adventure out of an otherwise great film. It's not a bad film, it's fun, clever and creepy but it doesn't really push boundaries in its conclusion so much as nudge them, hoping they will fall over on their own."

      "text": "The Call is a perfect example of a movie that not only has a ton of potential but also is executed so very well until the very end. The plot is very interesting and well developed and the acting is absolutely incredible. Abigail Breslin deserves an Oscar nomination for how believable she is in this film. The back and forth between her and Halle Berry's characters immerse you completely into the movie and have you on the edge of your seat. The supporting cast of Morris Chestnut, Michael Eklund, and even cameo appearances by Michael Imperioli and others don't disappoint either but this is hands down the Berry and Breslin show. But as I said, the flaw was in the last ten minutes because up until that point, we were looking at a solid 9/10 caliber film. Those last ten minutes caused the film to go from a nail-biting thriller surrounding unfortunately realistic circumstances to yet another cliched film where drama and suspense is built upon stupidity and unrealistic actions and reactions. Some people might not care much but to me, that killed the immersion and the movie-watching experience and definitely took the movie down a few notches. The fact that there was essentially no closure just added to the last several minutes being weak. Nonetheless, this was actually a pretty good movie but it had \"great\" potential."

      "text": "When it was announced that WWE was staring a film company, like most, I thought it was a joke. After some success with films like the Marine and 12 Rounds, the company earned some legitimacy and with it comes bigger talent and better Directors. The Call is the first WWE film that doesn't star a wrestler, and it was every bit as good as any Hollywood thriller that was released last year. Halle Berry stars as a 911 operator, whose worse nightmare is realized, when a kidnapping victim calls in from the trunk of a serial killers car. From there, the Call becomes 90 minutes of pure, non-stop intensity. It's hard to imagine a film that features a girl in a trunk and a woman in a call center, being as entertaining as it was, but that's where the experienced Hollywood talent comes into play. Halle Berry is not someone I consider to be a terrific actress, but she surprised me, by playing a character who had to overcome emotion and think on her feet. It quickly becomes evident that going by the book will lead to this girls death, and the operator comes up with some pretty novel ideas about how to deal with the situation. The supporting cast, which does feature an active WWE superstar, is also very good in assisting with the statewide manhunt. This film was really on pace to be one of my favorite films of the year until the ending. It was very strange, but the film gets to a certain point and then just ends. There may not have been much more of the story to tell, but the way it ended made me feel like I left the theater a few minutes early to answer an important phone call or something. It maybe a small thing to some, but to me, it really took a lot away from an otherwise terrific film. The Call is not that original, outside of the particular situation, it's a type of film you've seen many times over. It is however intense, fast paced, very entertaining, and most definitely worth the price of admission."

Once Berry leaves the call center, the film takes a nose dive. After coasting along for an hour, the last thirty minutes are pretty standard fare ... and not overly good standard fare at that. The movie's villain, once fully revealed and explained, wasn't all that interesting."

      "text": "At a first glance, \"The Call\" might seem like a minor work, destined to arouse interest only after its DVD release, and to be watched absent-mindedly during an autumn afternoon. Not that it tries to be subtle, or pretends to be meaningful: \u201cThe Call\u201d is action, jump scares, petty suspense; it\u2019s built to entertain the viewer for its 92 minutes of running time, and sell a lot of popcorn. Don\u2019t underestimate it though, it will surprise you.\rThe film tells the story of Jordan (Halle Berry), a 911 operator at the Los Angeles Police Department. She works in the \u201cHive\u201d, a police nest where the buzz of emergency calls never stops, 24/7. One day, realising that she has lost her control and objectivity during a call ended in tragedy, Jordan decides to give up the headset and pick up the training of new recruits. But six months later, while leading a tour of the Hive with a group of wannabe operators, she ends up handling a call from Casey (Abigail Breslin), a teenager kidnapped by a ruthless and psychotic killer (Michael Eklund), and locked in the trunk of his car racing towards certain death. Unfortunately the film doesn\u2019t show what happens with the job applicants, but I like to interpret it as a metaphor for how best to weigh the pros and cons of a new job, and then eventually withdraw your application.\rAfter niche films like \u201cThe Machinist\u201d and \u201cTranssiberian\u201d and a lot of TV work, director Brad Anderson returns to cinema to give personality to a script that, on its own, would hardly make an interesting film. Contrarily to his previous work, which shows Anderson\u2019s passion for Hitchcockian situations and atmospheres, \u201cThe Call\u201d is marked by a more commercial and easy-going style. Predictably, the characters adhere to the genre\u2019s standard, at the expense of the film\u2019s credibility: their personalities are light years away from the complexity of Christian Bale\u2019s Trevor Reznik in \u201cThe Machinist\u201d. \u201cThe Call\u201d prefers to focus on keeping tension high throughout the film, using gimmicks that are all-but-new but still effective, easily keeping the audience on the edge of their seats. And although the interpretations are just good enough to fit the level of action and thrills set by the mediocre script, it\u2019s impossible not to notice the director\u2019s skills. His talent shines through every shot, particularly in the grueling and never-ending second act, where a terrified Casey, locked in the car\u2019s trunk, is on the phone with Jordan. That\u2019s when drama escalates.\rThe film then takes the unexpected turn nobody asked for: a \u201cSilence Of The Lambs\u201d-like twist of plot that appears shockingly unintelligent and involuntarily hilarious. I won\u2019t spoil the ending, but the astonishment it provokes is worth experiencing on your own skin. This finale, so illogical and grotesque, jeopardises the reputation of what could have been a discrete film, but at the same time turns it into an unmissable guilty pleasure. And that\u2019s how a mostly forgettable feature, made with good intentions but without great ideas, instantly becomes a cult. One of the final shots, with the bad guy lying at the bottom of a pit, the good guys towering above him, and the American flag towering over them, is a truly remarkable page in the history of trash moments in cinema."

La belette qui se fait enlever, que dis-je, l'\u00e9pouvantable b\u00e9casse tape prodigieusement sur les nerfs par contre. J'attendais en fait avec impatience que l'affreux la d\u00e9coupe pour mettre fin \u00e0 cette agitation hyst\u00e9rique permanente.C'est assez dommage, car une bonne moiti\u00e9 du film exploite tr\u00e8s habilement cet enl\u00e8vement t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique et la recherche qui en d\u00e9coule ; la derni\u00e8re partie devient cependant trop classique et sans surprise, se bornant \u00e0 rester dans les clous du thriller hollywoodien syndical.La mise en sc\u00e8ne malgr\u00e9 quelques errements (cam\u00e9ra agit\u00e9e, montage t\u00e9l\u00e9scop\u00e9) s'av\u00e8re assez efficace et le rythme demeure assez soutenu. Un film assez bon, tout compte fait, mais auquel il manque pas mal de choses pour devenir vraiment bon."
