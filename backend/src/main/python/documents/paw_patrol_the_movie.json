Imo, Much better than Raya or Space Jam. Saw both with my son and I was ready for them to be over long before the credits rolled. Paw Patrol held my attention and the animation was better than the TV show. Good, if you have kids and they like Paw Patrol."

      "text": "It's OK.  It is an hour and 15 minute episode of the regular show with crazy detailed animation and blink and you miss them \"celebrity\" voices. There are no fart jokes so it has that going for it. Chase is dealing with PTSD for some reason and gets over it for some other reason.  There is a new dog that serves no purpose.  No singing.  It is over quickly and it is not too annoying for an adult."

In itself, I really liked the realism of the characters and a new plot. Besides that here in Mexico, the voice actors of the series returned and give voice to the characters in the film. It is enjoyable and very entertaining. I hope a sequel to this one where they put the other characters in the series and be more interesting."

But since I can\u2019t and I now have to live with this, I will say the kids loved it, so that\u2019s good I guess. I\u2019d say just stick with the show though. It\u2019s so much better, the voice actors are way better in the show than in the movie. I have it a seven bc it\u2019s a kids movie and the kids liked it so that\u2019s all that matters."
