There was plenty of humor, some great wit and \"mob\" dialogue, and the acting was fantastic. Honestly, De Niro was the least impressive role in the film. I loved how they featured the children a bit more and showed how their lives have been affected by the whole ordeal. That being said, the plot wasn't overly original or exciting so the ceiling for a film like this is relatively low. The only thing I felt the movie did wrong was how the family's location was discovered. To me, the entire conflict of the movie hinging on such a ridiculously coincidental happenstance was lazy writing and, while you get over it during the conclusion, it was still rather unfortunate that the went in that direction. Overall though, it's a solid film that never bores."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Luc Besson has no sense of genre or tone.

It reminded me a bit of Kick-ass. There is only one problem in that film. The story has some gaps such as why did they move in Normandie? That is not explained in the film.

Seems more like it should have been two movies or at least a continuation of some made for tv series. @ramblingmango"}, {"rating": "1", "text": "This movie doesn't even deserve a score, I couldn't even get passed the first hour without losing my temper at how stupid this movie is. Firstly, having lived in France as a British student for the last 3 years, I have to say that the portrayal of France and French people is abysmal, I don't expect realism, but I at least expect respect toward the things that make France such a wonderful place. Firstly, you'll meet maybe 1-in-10 people who even speak a TINY BIT of English, this movie blows it out of proportion, I appreciate them speaking English as the film is aimed at English speaking audiences, but it also sadly pointed out how dumb the dialogue was. Also, French food is absolutely wonderful and for the most part, isn't much different from the food available in the US and Britain, in fact, almost ALL stores sell British foods, Not at one point have I not been able to get something I've been looking for in some way or another. This movie goes out of it's way to insult French foods, I find it disgusting how they even have the audacity to do that. Next is the portrayal of French people themselves, this films portrays them as being rude, intruding and selfish, NONE of which is factual, the French, especially in the rural areas are the kindest people you will ever meet and they love having guests in their country, obviously, you will meet the odd bigot who dislikes you for being foreign, but this film knocks it out of the ball park in that regard. Now that I've covered that. Lets look at the movie itself, the acting for the most part is okay, But the kids can't act, not at one point did I find their roles believable.\r At the end of the day, all I see in this movie, is a family full of  moving to a town full of bigots and watch the main character randomly kill people he dislikes and watch everyone else do insanely stupid things for absolutely no reason. Not at one point did I even smile through the small amount of this movie that I watched.\r The problem lies in the direction, this film tried to be comedy, but there is NOTHING funny about the situation, Why are films like The Iceman and Goodfellas so great? Because they are dark, brutal and serious. If this film took the correct direction, it could have been a dark and brutal gangster film, but it decided to go with the quirky comic approach to a situation only madman would find funny.\r It's a shame because De Niro's acting is superb as always, shame everything else about the movie lacks any sense or logic. Maybe one day Il give the film the benefit of the doubt and watch it with a few friends, but I honestly couldn't see the film getting any better."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Everyone in this movie is unnecessarily violent.

It further lost its comedic identity when it swung abruptly in the other direction to wrap up as a \"too serious\" dramatic action flick.

The only part of the movie I didn't like (spoiler incoming immediately) is when the daughter tried to kill herself over the math teacher. 1st of all she talked and acted like a female who has already experienced sex, a lot of sex.

This movie was billed as a dark comedy, there is a lot of darkness via the extreme violence and not a chuckle in the whole movie.

It was so predictable that it held no surprises whatsoever. Don't waste your money. After 10 minutes I wanted to ask for a refund, but my friend had fallen asleep and I did not want to wake him up and tell him we were leaving. So I sat through the whole stinking thing. Basically this movie was not funny at all. Unless you were a ten-year old. And the movie is way too violent for a 10 year old. The theater was fairly crowded but the people were not laughing.

When they're crossed, all four of them are prone to violence, which provides much of the film's dark humor. Director Luc Besson (\"Taken\" 1& 2 and \"Transporter\" 1, 2, 3) knows how to stage action, which pops in regularly.

Many of the supporting players as police or FBI agents and gangsters all look, and act, their roles believably.\r I think the enjoyment of this films comes from the director Luc Besson, who also had a hand in the screenplay with Michael Caleo, and executive producer Martin Scorsese who have been in this territory before and don\u2019t take themselves seriously.\r \u201cThe Family\u201d is much better than expected which is always a good surprise when going to the movies."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "This flavor will mostly appeal to older audiences leaving younger people bored and wondering.

There are moments of humor or violence thrown to give this movie a pulse every now and then, but ultimately this is a very dull and lifeless film. The film is at's best when it is focusing on humor. The violence just comes off as sadistic and cruel. John D'leo steals the show. He, Dianna Agron, and the plots surrounding them end up being the best parts of the movie, making the parents (Pfieffer and De Niro) uninteresting. They do not save the movie from ultimately being boring however, and Agron's story ends up turning into just another broken heart story.\r Overall I found this movie to be a boring waste of time. There's not enough humor and much it's violence ends up coming off as unnecessary. There are some interesting bits here and there, but overall the film is lifeless and uninteresting. My recommendation is that you just pass this film by. It falls short in just about every area leaving the film to be stuck in some sort of limbo of mediocrity.

Great acting from the family, Roberto De Niro, Michelle Pfeiffer, Dianna Agron, and John D'Leo, also from FBI Tommy Lee Johns.

With huge star power and a well known Director, this film had all the makings of a classic, unfortunately it has some major plot holes and lacks direction. One moment it seems like you're watching a comedy, that is about to break out, but then in the blink of an eye it's a drama, addressing difficult issues. The big tagline is that the Manzoni family is in hiding, and can't seem to behave themselves, but it's a lot more than that. The FBI has decided to place this Italian, Brooklyn mob family in the south of France. Even if their behavior wasn't outlandish, how is a Brooklyn family supposed to fit into a small village in France? They would naturally stand out like a sore thumb. Besides the obvious plot holes, other things are left out of the equation, the most glaring being the back story behind the families joining the program. While the story is all over the place, the film does feature a truly all-star cast and trust me, they help. If this wasn't De Niro, Jones, and Pheiffer, the film would have completely fallen apart and failed to hold my interest. The fact is that these are some the best actors in the world and they all do a tremendous job of keeping the audiences attention. There isn't much of a story here and it's nowhere near as funny as it was advertised to be, but big names and great performances fill seats in the theaters and that should have been this films hook.

In addition, the ending is horrible and leaves you scratching your head, wondering why they thought it would work well.

That makes us to think a sequel is in a due to clarify the remaining doubts.\r This is not what we expected from the writer, director of hit movies like 'Leon: The Professional' and 'The Fifth Element'. He made many good movies as well average ones and this movie comes under okay type comedy-thriller. It had a good pair of actors, De Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer.

But in contrast to some of his earlier movies, this is actually good.

Regrettably I don't know either of the actors names off the top of my head because both of them are reasonably unknown, but they both deserve to be in more stuff (especially John D'Leo as the boy). Every now and again Tommy Lee Jones pops up too. The plot makes sense and holds up, even in the overblown final act. And the action, again even if the overblown final act, is exciting and will keep viewers only watching for explosions entertained.\rMuch like most of the other comedies I have watched in my entire life, the main problem is that I didn't laugh much. It's either that this is an unsuccessful black comedy or that I'm an unhappy pedantic  who rarely ever smiles, but I did laugh a below average amount of times. Sure I was almost in hysterics at the very clever joke about De Niro being able to express any emotion just by saying  and the two agents who are constantly listening in to the families every word have some hilarious conversations. But most of the other jokes only got a smirk or a weak smile out of me.\rHowever, that does not stop The Family from being a hugely enjoyable black comedy, which delivers excitement and thrills (but fails to satisfy the audience by way of jokes) without forgetting emotion and story arcs.

DeNiro's character is just so sadistic and unforgivingly violent with no regard for human life whatsoever. If you give him back the wrong change at the grocery store, he'll practically smash your head on the counter, and his character is anything but likable. The kids are smart and resourceful, but their talents get wasted on gunfights and unnecessary bloodshed. Michelle Pfeifer is really the only person in the movie with any shred of morals. Tommy Lee Jones just smirks and scowls as usual, not really adding anything more to his character. Though, I can say that I enjoyed the little Goodfellas in-joke for DeNiro.

This leads to some quickly escalated violent scenes, which are decently entertaining, for those who can appreciate the dark humor. In between it all, there is also plenty of cultural clashes, namely American and French, which are often dealt with in the same spirit.
