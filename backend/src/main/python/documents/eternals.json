      "text": "This movie is breaking the typical Marvel mold and that\u2019s okay. It is breathtaking in every since. With ten main heroes and the building of a whole new world within the current MCU, it was so well done. It goes back to one undercurrent of Marvel is that humans are good and deserve to exist, no matter their flaws and errors. The semi-lead character is played Gemma Cham & she is the soul of the movie. Every leader of the Eternals is a woman of color and they command respect. It also flips the script, similar to Captain Marvel, where the semi-lead man who turns against the other characters goal. How they frame where they are in various parts of human history is magnificent, it breathes life into our stories of the past, good and bad. It is funny but not as much as other established MCU storylines but the first round of character-establishing movies weren\u2019t all comedy. I loved it and I can\u2019t wait to see more from these heroes. Also HARRY **** STYLES MY WORD BLESS. CHERRY ON TOP, no pun intended."

      "text": "In the grand scheme of MCU... where do Eternals exist? I can't connect the dot... don't see how it move the current MCU timeline... felt very disconnected and separated. Eternals as the almighty demi gods are not that powerful actually... Thor can beat all of them easily.It took them thousands of years to eliminate the Deviants. Thor and Hulk can do same things in 5 years easily. Eternals should not exist in the MCU... but seeing it as a standalone movie without thinking how it relates to MCU... I really like the movie.It's a high concept movie similar to Dune where it centers around theologies... kinda biblical approach in telling the story of how the universe and human beings were created and evolve. I also believe the writers are afraid to delve deeper in the theologies aspect because they need to put this movie within the MCU and this made the movie feel uneven and all over the place.Overall I enjoy the movie... the fight scenes are amazing and THIS IS ANGELINA JOLIE movie... I don't care about other characters.. if Marvel decide to write off the movie from MCU because of the worst MCU reviewed movie status... I don't care BUT Thena should live on in the MCU... she have the best power set among the Eternals. If you approach this movie thru MCU thoughts, I don't think you gonna like the movie but it still a recommendation from me 7/10.Black Knight is a great Marvel character... can't wait to see Jon Snow become The Black Knight. In the comics he's also a member of The Avengers."

It sets the right pace to develop the characters and show all of their singular and interesting way of being part of this world and it\u2019s history, with all of the human contradictions and personal drama on the right notch to set a good plot twist.Out of the \u201cMarvel formula\u201d, with the right pitch of humor, drama and action, i felt happy and satisfied again, after more than 2 years without going to Theaters."

      "text": "My main concern regarding the Eternals had to do with the huge baggage they carried, and even for Chlo\u00e9 Zhao that turned out to be a barrier that she couldn't overcome.There are too many explanations in Eternals and that slows the pace quite a bit, coupled with its long duration and lack of action, the film feels too irregular and its progress is stunted.Yet I also have to mention the things that does right, and that is that, although it's still a Marvel superhero film, Chlo\u00e9 Zhao finally manages to shake up a bit the exhausted introductory formula for new characters that are coming to this cinematic universe.Although it must be admitted that this is due to the complexity and scale of the story that is being told.Marvel has opened a door as large as the multiverse by finally directly introducing cosmic entities that are simply larger than anything else the MCU has shown so far.The possibilities are endless, you just need the ambition and the talent to exploit them.The most solid point of this film is of course its cast. Even though the most important leading role falls to Gemma Chan, everyone involved is given the opportunity to show off.Some to a lesser extent than others, but the cast is sufficiently balanced, although the shared humor came to feel too gratuitous after a while.The visual is simply remarkable. I can't recall another MCU movie that can boast such excellent use of cinematography and lighting as this one.There are a lot of visual effects, but only at some points the CGI and green screen are truly noticeable and not really problematic. Ben Davis' work is simply outstanding.For the rest, I can only say that even with its problems, Eternals is yet another solid addition to the ever-growing MCU.It knows how to balance its strengths and keeps the machinery greased and working.It's still the same formula, but at least it has a little shake to it, and it doesn't feel so ordinary.Predictable? Yes. Still entertaining though.Now it is only necessary to see what plans Marvel will have for these characters considering the ending and the two post-credits scenes.Time will tell."

Things were a little bit squashed, meaning the characters didn\u2019t all get the amount of deeper characterization that I had hoped for, but for as much content that was put into this film, I\u2019d say Zhao did a good job with what she was working with. Plus, the diversity in this film is so important to so many people. As a woman it\u2019s amazing to see women in the lead, and as a gay person I can\u2019t tell you how excited I was when Phastos and his husband, Haaz, kissed (the first in the MCU) I got such a warm feeling in my heart! I look forward to more representation in the future!"

There was a lot of story/world building which might be why there aren\u2019t as many positive reviews since it\u2019s more of a broad story rather than character specific. The acting was amazing and the CGI was beautifully done and on par with their other films. Overall a great movie with great character relationships, however I think if the score was better throughout the movie it would\u2019ve helped to portray the heartbreaking scenes better."
