Just a reminder that these pop culture jokes are all done by islanders who otherwise wouldn\u2019t be familiar with any of these things. Alongside forced fads are apparently mandatory scenes that copy what other kids\u2019 movie do, particularly the \u201cThis whole thing is my fault\u201d line. Listen: copying others never works out! It\u2019s important to stand out from the crowd to leave an impression, and not jump on a bandwagon to be just more white noise.The lack of originality doesn\u2019t exploit the new love interest for Red, that being Chuck\u2019s sister, Silver. Yes, apparently all blockbusters require a love interest to be better. Silver does love mathematics, except this low amount of personality isn\u2019t enough to make something of the romance, especially since most of their interactions have them lying on top of each other, to give the wrong idea for onlookers. It\u2019s much like when Fiona tries to pull an arrow out from Shrek\u2019s butt, until Donkey sees her on his back, then says slyly, \u201cLook, if you wanted to be alone, all you had to do was ask, okay?\u201dOn the light side, Red is a better developed character now with a transparent fear of being left out; the feelings get stronger once he is seen respected as hero of Bird Island, only to be a nobody again once a truce between the pigs and birds is established. Now, Red falls into depression, left eating popcorn while on the floor, then his chance of purpose finally comes when he unites with the pig king Leonard to form a team set on stopping their lands from destruction by Eagle Island.This Eagle Island of course is inhabited by eagles, but their home suffers from sub-zero conditions that freezes their entire livelihood. A montage shows the mundane activities on Eagle Island that are impossible to happen due to ice, including showering, swimming, or eating fish, but it doesn\u2019t work because the cartoon vs. photorealism animation style isn\u2019t consistent enough, attempting to merge the exact shapes of little kid doodles with what can be felt by touch. The animation is so inconsistent in fact, that in one scene, Red wears a snow cap that gets blown away by the wind, then it\u2019s back again minutes later. The poor use of computer technology is not the only complaint to address about Eagle Island, in fact, there are countless more about its backstory\u2026 how did their home reach sub-zero conditions? Morgan Freeman, please offer your narration to help provide answers! A voiceover would really be nice here, because the characters all talk too fast to understand their explanations of the plot.Instead of making sense, this sequel focuses on one new addition to the world that helps the most in improving the series: three baby hatchlings. These little fluff-balls seem to be inspired by Looney Toons in the adventures they go on to return some eggs that they lost at sea. The main plot switches back-and-forth between these little guys, leaving on appropriate cliff hangers, and picks up again from where left off before. These scenes take up a significant amount of screen time, representing both the biggest strength and greatest flaw of the feature. It\u2019s great because these scenes are actually funny in their gags with relatively little dialogue, but poor because these fun antics prove little focus on the story; besides one tiny contribution the hatchling trio make in the climax, they could be written out super easily without hurting anything. While they can get a good chuckle, for each good comedic line, there\u2019s three more that don\u2019t work (that bothersome mime from the first movie is still here unfortunately).There\u2019s something worse at stake with the prioritization of jokes over story, it proves that The Angry Birds Movie 2 encourages individualism through the selfish, foolish actions of Red\u2019s team. Instead of encouraging friendship, it popularizes the term \u201cfrenemies,\u201d and since this movie and the last can\u2019t remain consistent in forming common sense in their worlds, it numbs a child\u2019s brains more as they take in whatever messages the TV tells them. Really\u2014they notice pig rumps more than story. Heck, a line in here shouts, \u201cNone of us wear pants!\u201d Imagine kids repeating that around the house!"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Better Than 1The Angry Birds Movie 2 isn\u2019t flawless, But it is definitely a step up from it's mediocre predecessor."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I love this movie, this is just like a compilation of my favorite song in a single movie"}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Angry Birds 2 feels more or less the cinematic equivalent of a Creeper hanging onto a rope or something.He's at the end of an Action Scene. No arms,no legs,just his head,hanging (and \"chewing\") on a rope as the tension-y end that feels like it'll end on a pretty good note,but that,through little flaws that outweigh the good stuff,feels like an uncertain possibility. Yeah,there are surprises here and there,but,overall,is just a weird product that doesn't end well.But hey,at least there was a story in the middle of it.First off,I love that this is,first and foremost,a character movie (unlike the first one,where it didn't know where to go with the lead),as it tackles a certain element that I don't see often in Superhero Movies post-Origin: Will the Hero be loved by many for ages? Is he always going to be the standout for many and not be taken instantly as a menace?Also please,keep doing these movies. If anything,they'll be the only good musical work by Heitor Pereira. Only this time,he tackles the John Powell,where he repeats certain themes in different ways,and it's always enjoyable to listen to.The humor is either great humor or a masterclass in horrible writing. Sometimes you have the kind of poop joke I'd love to see more (or an Invisible Spray lasting forever),while other times it's a painfully unfunny Baby Shark joke that pissed me off more than the dab joke they did at the beginning. That was where the movie lost me. Or it was the Snapchat joke,I don't know\u2026Now hear me out on this one,but am I the Only one who noticed a kinda big downgrade in the Animation Department? Not that everything looked bad,but now Sony Pictures Animation takes the helm instead of Rovio,and apparently everything felt so...rocky. Especially compared to the laser-focused animation of the first movie,where it was random movements,or whatever they showed us with Spider-Man Into The Spider-Verse,where they can still animate characters in perfect ways. And the pacing was just as fast as something like The LEGO Batman Movie,where you had to make heads or tails about what was going on in case you didn't follow. Although it definitely made for a quick seat. A good example of that would be the beginning,where they hammer in hardcore several plot points because...idk,the director was afraid you'd not instantly care for Red?Overall it was the sunrise movie of 2019 alright,but at the same time I still think IT was a better surprise,especially considering that this had the familiar tropes of a kids flick. One that I have to ask. You a good Animated Movie? Or a miserable Kids Movie? Make or break,Sony,c'mon."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "I was hoping for this to suck but I'm so shocked it actually didn't.I mean, there's nothing memorable in it but it could've been much worse.It's better than the first one without a doubt.

Angry Birds 2 is most definitely the latter. In fact, it's so light on plot that they had to splice in cutaways to what is essentially an animated short in order to reach feature length.The majority of the returning side-characters are given so little to do that the only reason I can think of as to why they were brought back is because they had significant roles in the first one, and the new additions, villainous or otherwise, fail to make much of an impression. As a result, Red and his love interest Silver are the only ones who feel important in any way, shape, or form. They're at least given something of an arc to grow and learn from while the rest just act goofy or stupid the entire time.None of this matters too much though as children's films like this tend to live or die by how funny they are, rather than things like the actual quality of the writing. I doubt there's a kid alive that wouldn't find this absolutely hilarious. So it has its target audience in the bag. Adults on the other hand will likely struggle with just how irreverent it all is. For example, during a speed dating event one of the main trio boldly declares to a potential partner that he \"eats dirt.\" He then proceeds to open his mouth and sure enough it's full of dirt. That's a little too dumb for my blood. Plus, for the life of me I'll never understand how men in thongs and just butts in general have become the height of prepubescent comedy. That kind of stuff didn't make me laugh back in the day and it doesn't get to me now.As hit or miss as it may be the older you get, it's still guaranteed to tickle your funny bone at some point or another. That's because Angry Birds 2 covers a wide array of humor in an effort to fill every single second with a joke of some kind. The entire stretch with the eagle disguise is nothing short of pure gold and had me guffawing to the point where I could barely breathe. I also caught myself cracking up every now and then at the occasional clever one-liner or bit of slapstick.A truly great animated film would leave you gawking at the beauty of its animation, rolling on the floor at it's comedy, and pondering over the complexities of its narrative. However, Angry Birds 2 shows that two out of three ain't bad. Particularly as far as the youngsters are concerned. This isn't Pixar so I can't recommend that anyone with a driver's license watch it on their own, but if you get pulled into it for a family movie night or something it is sporadically amusing. There's just not enough here to truly engage you."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "I just hope the movie industry will realize that movies surrounding video games are not a good idea."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "You would expect to watch The Angry Birds Movie 2? I Don't think so. More importantly The Angry Birds Movie 2 was nothing but cringy, lack of Original Angry Birds 2 design and Story, and memes like Baby Shark. It all started by war between Birds and pig, that was original Angry Birds. Until pig giving a Birds a peace. That's why Angry Birds is dead. which matters a fact, Silver is... what the heck is Sony did this to her? It Support to be original, not changing design it like original 2019 version trailer of Sonic The Hedgehog Movie. Another opinion is about Matilda and Terence. My idea for The Angry Birds Movie 2 was Red and Stella want to keep Luca as adopted parents, but Sony stoled my idea and replaced with Terence, Matilda, and Zoe?!? What a lack, you made Bombtilda fans breaking heart into pieces, you know what grind my gears, you Sony, your support to make Offical Redella scene, not Redilver scene, and more immortal you gonna tearing Redella fans' heart into pieces just like Bombtilda fans. And who else think that's worst nightmare? You guess it, Dub, fortnite dance, selfies, and Baby Shark, also the dirty joke was pig wearing underwears. One more thing. Hatching story doing same this as Scrat story from Ice Age Films, and replaced The Blues and Stella as Background Characters? I'm sorry you guys, but you all just being enjoy of Crappy Angry Birds Movie 2. I just want to make a better reboot of Angry Birds Movie for Disney, but they never listen to me or Disney, they didn't want to make it happened, I'm not moving forward for some 2016 trashy-era of Angry Birds.
