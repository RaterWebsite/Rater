James Cameron not only the writer but also the director of the movie \u201cAvatar\u201d (2009) has brought everyone\u2019s dreams into reality by utilising the modern art of visual cinematography and 3-D imaging to blur the lines of virtual reality, making it more realistic. Cameron has also utilised certain star actors such as Sigourney Weaver and Sam Worthington who have won multiple awards in the past to play crucial roles in his film.The movie being in the category of fantasy/science fiction, it begins in the future or more precise, year 2154 and one the many themes of the movie is protecting the environment.Involving the military, they set off on a mission to collect, colonise and learn from the new planet, Pandora. Their main task for this operation is to collect a rich mineral that Earth desperately needs more of and they recently found that there was an abundant amount under their village.Unobtanium, the mineral, they need to save their energy crisis or to put it bluntly, to survive and is what keeps the project running. Those who went had to be in cyrosleep as Pandora, the new planet is 4.4 light-years away from Earth. The movie is both a show and tell with its incredible graphics of a new world, its nature and of course the natives, the Na\u2019vi, blue people who stand at 10 feet tall and its story plot of the mission to collect the resources and a turn of events after the main protagonist learns about what was going to happen if the mission proceeds.I like how the actors played their parts well, and not just with their words but with actions as well. Some actors in movies struggle and get nervous and would cause themselves to not sound or seem natural. Zoe Saldana who played Neytiri, the Na\u2019vi princess, was perfect for playing the role in this film as she could not only play the part but was actually able to get into character for this film. For example, she manages to accept a different accent to mimic being a native Na\u2019vi.The computer-generated imagery also known as CGI, can only capture the movement and facial expressions in animated forms, but it is the actors job to give life to their characters. The director, not only did he capture the motion, but also the intent of the actors to make his characters even more realistic.There are of course strengths and faults in this movie just like any other. One of the biggest faults in this movie is that the transitions from one angle to another is a little off but hard to notice. For example, a different hand positioning from a camera angle to another and mild nudity of the natives as another fault. The strength of this film is that it follows its theme and executes it as the film goes towards the end, they of course follow up and was able to save the environment from the destruction.Overall, I think the movie \u201dAvatar\u201d is a great film. It being rated as PG-13 is at minimal as the faults of those who are younger would have to watch the violence and mild nudity. I personally enjoyed the film and it left me in amazed and if you haven\u2019t seen it yet, then I suggest you go see it now. It would not only leave you at the edge of your seats but also keep your blood pumping . 7\u00bd out of 10"

What do you want more than that?! Every part in the movie is perfect starting from plot to visual effects until the performance.If I want to talk about visual effects I couldn't stop, the designers of ''moon Pandora'' they couldn't design better than this, it seems so realistic and breathtaking, beside Pandora's animals, plants, trees and people, everything perfect.I like the plot also, it's showing how the humans are savages, unlike others aliens movies that show the aliens are the enemy and the humans are innocents, the story is really reflecting our lives, we already ruined our earth by wars, killing animals and cutting trees, and it will be same if we control another planet.''Avatar'' is one of the greatest movie in the history of cinema, and I would like to thank the genius director and writer ''James Cameron'' and the whole cast for this masterpiece, and I hope \"Avatar 2, 3 & 4'' will be as same as this."

      "text": "There's a certain something to be said about the power of a visually strong movie like Avatar. It's kinda like a sleazy, but charismatic sales person. You like the person while your in his office, cause he just reeks of charm (or cigarettes) and you buy in to his pitch, cause he's good at what he does, but when you leave the store, you find that you really didn't like the product that much after all. That's kinda how I feel about Avatar. The movie's visuals are amazing and I would say that nothing will be defeating it anytime soon as far as that goes. But when you brush away all that, what you're left with isn't necessarily a bad movie, but an average to ok one. I say this because most of the time I spent watching it was marveling at the amazing visuals that Cameron's team presented us. That part I can't heap enough praise on, but other than that, the story of the movie pretty much comes across as a straight up black and white morality play. I can understand the \"it's just a movie\" that people may say to that kind of suggestion, but where it doesn't hold up is when you try to pass the movie off as a political/social statement about our society. Nothing in reality is ever black and white, and to do so discredits a lot of what makes us a very complicated, arrogant, and interesting species. Aside from it's horrid attempts to justify why our material world is wrong, the story presents the humans as evil, greedy, and violent; but the Na'vi are peaceful, harmonious, and coexist with nature. Of course the main character ends up going native, finds he likes the tribe more, and then sides with them in the upcoming inevitable bloodbath, and the usual sequence of most big budget movies plays out with no originality whatsoever. Still the movie does entertain, even though it provides a mixed message, and there are some very interesting moments. The real credit to Avatar is the level of thought put into the actual world itself, and here the production/design team did a remarkable job in making Pandora a reality. To me it's a shame that they went for a more simplified story of good and evil as opposed to something more complex and real, but I guess that was never their intention in the first place. It probably wouldn't have been as successful in the theatres if it was. A simple message doesn't mean a bad one, but in this case it was more of a typical one."

A tech demo of what budget can do in this day and age, but that is it.\r Lame recycled story, copied scenes, it's like someone cut some scenes from other movies and re-animated them on a PC with blue people.\r The only redeeming quality of the story, frankly, is the fact that the humans are somewhat accurately portrayed. Villains, but not idiotic unexplained villainy, but a nice blend of excusable and inexcusable.\r This is a movie that is seen, not understood. Eye candy, and not a very good one at that. The people are blends of 2 Earth animals, the animals are blends of 2 Earth animals, basically, it's just a jungle people story with cream on top.\r Under no circumstances is this movie a high scorer. Tech demo, 10. Movie, 5 because of the experience. Seriously, if seeing a movie on a small 2D screen makes it sucky, then it was sucky to begin with."

      "text": "Wow, what a movie.  Maybe it is just all of the subpar Netflix movies I have been watching recently, but  \u201cAvatar\u201d has aged exceptionally well in the 11 years since its release.  The battle sequence actually has emotional resonance.  I have seen so much war in Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and Marvel movies, but I never cared about any of them.  Cameron got me invested in a way none of the others could.  If you can enjoy a roller coaster movie, you should love this one, especially if you have a solid theater system.  If you can find a way to watch this as it was intended, in 3D, by all means do it, but even in old fashioned 2D, it was amazing.I don't know what percentage of the Neytiri character is Zoe Saldana vs. the animators, but somebody deserves an award for that role. There is a deep passion expressed by her that is very rarely captured on film.  I give it an A, make a point to go see this movie."

Story is good, I really have not much bad to say. It is  a weird movie but looking back it was ahead of it's time and now can be understood easier. When it came out, it was overrated. But... people still talk about it today, so there must be a reason, reasons!It was the best looking CGI movie when it came out.Sure, movie has tons of problems that I would say are \"cringy\", but have you seen the documentary about it? The impact of this movie still can be seen today. I actually don't remember any movie like this, this is completely original movie, without \"MCU-like\" setups or part of already set \"universe\" like James Bond for example. This was the most expensive movie ever made and most successful movie of all time (until Endgame).And it did not even have that expensive cast like, Endgame.It has enough interesting things inside than any blockbuster movie.This is cyberpunk, fantasy, Jurrasic-park-ish and space movie at the same time. Dialogue is good, not boring, pacing is great, not boring.The characters are really well made. This is one of the few movies that deserve the word: EPIC"

      "text": "I confess that this film never really caught my eye until I read about it. I still remember when it was in theaters more than ten years ago. More recently, I decided to see it. The film was a success, as we all know, and I find it surprising that I didn't have the right to any sequels.The script takes place in a distant future, when humans have ruined the Earth but are colonizing and exploring other planets like Pandora, where Jake Sully, a veteran of the Marines, is going after being recruited by a scientific program. Pandora has a rare and valuable ore that humans want, but it also allows the planet to have an exuberant and unusual biological life. It happens to be inhabited by natives called Naavi (who look like huge blue humans with a long tail), and they are determined to protect their world from the greed of the Terran's. Sully joins the Avatar Program, which allows him to remotely control the body of a Naavi. If the program allows humans to live and learn from them (as its director, scientist Dr. Grace, wants), it also turns them into Trojan horses (as Colonel Miles, commander of the military forces in Pandora, wishes). This will put Sully in a conflict of loyalties while allowing him to see how the natives are connected to their world and are inseparable from it.The plot raises a number of pertinent questions. We can, for example, reflect on the way we have lived and managed our planet, on the superiority with which we see who is different from us, on how we despise the environment or deliberately harm it by greed, on our passion for war instead of peaceful conflict resolution or even about how technological and medical advances do not reach everyone and are put at the service of some wealthy people instead of being available to all. It is a script that makes you think and could be seen in many ways. Unfortunately, the story built on these premises is not so good. There is good material and the way Sully is divided in his loyalty as he lives with the natives is the backbone of the whole thing, but everything else is quite predictable and one-dimensional, and sometimes it sounds bad: humans are treated in a simplistic way and turned into despicable creatures, while the Naavi are idealized to the fullest. The old story of \"good guys and bad guys\".Sam Worthington shows all his talent in a demanding and likeable character. He plays well with Zoe Salda\u00f1a, his alien romantic couple. The actress is excellent and was having a good time in her career then. I also liked the work of Sigourney Weaver, in the role of a strong, bossy and grumpy scientist, who is guided by her ideals even if it means facing the military. But the best of the cast ends here. The rest are reduced to one-dimensional and stupid characters, as is the case with Stephen Lang (the \"brute like the stones\" colonel who only thinks about his mission), Michelle Rodr\u00edguez (the military hot girl who decides to collaborate with the \"goodies\" instead of helping the \"baddies\"), Giovanni Ribisi (one of the\" baddies\"), Joel David Moore (one of the\" goodies\"), Laz Alonso, CCH Pounder, Wes Studi (the \"perfect ones\") etc. This was somewhat disappointing in a film with so many qualities and such a high budget.It is in the technical aspects that this film excels. Directed by James Cameron, an avid fan of the green screen and a \"rival\" of Spielberg, it's a film that was built on top of an entire digital world. Thanks to this feature, Cameron can become a god for a minute and create a new universe with plants and animals that we have never seen and that exude beauty. The film has a spectacular cinematography and it does not pass five minutes without, in some way, making us hold our breath before such a show of color and light. Sound effects are very well-used also. Together with an epic and magnificent soundtrack by James Horner, we have the recipe for a blockbuster film that collected three Oscars in technical categories (Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects and Best Art Direction), with all the fairness and merit. I really feel sorry that I didn't see it on the big screen and that Cameron is so careless when it comes to the script and the story he tells us."

      "text": "Avatar - Breathtakingly BeautifulWhen movies are created, they are done so with intent. Different genres of film target specific audiences, a formula which has sustained Hollywood and it's industries since the beginning of the blockbuster movies. When a movie is created in a manner that sets in motion any given goal, said films success is pendant on whether or not that goal is reached. If a comedy creates laughter, or if a romance produces tears, then they are successes in their own right. So when a massively ambitious, seemingly impossible to create film aiming to usher in a new era manages to grab hold of it's audience and take them on an unprecedented cinematic roller coaster ride that delivers the goods every turn of the way, it can be considered successful. Avatar is that success.A work in progress that spanned a decade and a half, Avatar is more than just a film - it's an experience, an event. When James Cameron set out to make this movie back in the mid 90's, he realized that his ambitions were simply too far ahead of their time. His ideas could not be reached in a feasible manner, and due to this, he had to wait. Or create. Once informed that the image he held for this film was one that was out of grasp, he began working on the technology that would bring his masterpiece within reach. Fifteen years and nearly half a billion dollars later, James Cameron has brought that vision to the screen, and has done so in an extravagant and showstopping way.Avatar tells the tale of a war between species, each fighting for the ultimate survival of their race. Desperate to find the fuel for their dying planet, human soldiers and scientists set out from earth and set course for Pandora. A planet connected by all living things, Pandora is home to an indigenous species known as the Na'vi, as well as the precious element Unobtanium needed to save earth. Using transference technology, paralyzed marine Jake Sully is volunteered for the \"Avatar Program\", which enables the thoughts and mind of a human to be placed within the shell of a tube-born Na'vi body. Using this as technique to their advantage, Jake is sent into the harsh Jungles of Pandora in order to bond with the natives, thus gaining knowledge and insight on their ways. Having originally planned to use this knowledge as a means of negotiating the natives relocation, so that the humans can access the deposit of Unobtainium - which just happens to sit below their most worshiped and valued pseudo-deity of their planet.While the plot on paper may read as a standard shoot'em-up action sci-fi flick, it is a near inconceivable task to truly explain how incorrect this appearance truly is. This takes a stroke from every movie, and a dab from every genre, and manages to create a portrait of beauty, in which all pre-existing notion of what cinema can and cannot do is destroyed. Within the lengthy hundred and sixty some odd minutes of film, moviegoers will find that there is always something to keep them enthralled, a merciful gift when considering how tedious many of the longer film of recent memory can become.No matter what can be said about the overtly cheesy script,a criticism that, while holding true, manages to fit charmingly into the over-the-top nature of the film, Avatar does as it set out to do, bringing moviegoers a cinematic experience rather than a film. Relying on the technology that he created, Cameron pours his heart into this movie, and it shows in every scene. Ranging from the absurdly detailed creatures to all-too-realistic planet, this flick manages to tell a fulfilling story while all the while throwing jaw-dropping scenery at the audience, giving them only enough time to recover before bombarding them with yet another breathtaking shot.Be it the fantastical and charming love story told between the native and the outsider, or the too-real-to-be-true action scenes between gunships and foreign ferals, Avatar is what Star Wars was too the 70's, the Wizard Of Oz of the 40's - a masterpiece that will go down in movie history as a game changer of it's time."

      "text": "Avatar captures all realms of the human indulgence. It is the perfect form of hero story as well as having a positive message about saving the environment. The movie is extremely creative and imagined. We are presented with a new language called the Na'vi, a new goddess named Eywa who is presumed one with nature, and new fundamental lifeforms that engulf your imagination. The idea of the human controlled Avatars is something unprecedented. It makes the movie fun and at the same time plausible because the world of Pandora is so substantial and inhumane, that mankind is forced to create organic bodies that can not only survive but explore the land efficiently. The Avatars are controlled by people with similar DNA from a tranced state that allows them to connect into the body. The plot of the movie is also one that is imaginable yet realistic. In the year 2154, U.S. armed forces embark on a journey to an earth-like planet called Pandora. On Pandora there is an element called Unobtainium that is extremely valuable. When humans discover that there is a substantial amount of Unobtainium under a large tree called \"Home Tree\", where the natives live action needs to be taken. Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) gets lost on a botanist mission and ends up at Home Tree, and the only reason he wasn't killed is because Eywa showed the natives a \"sign\" not to kill him. Since Jake is able to join and train as a native, the humans want him to convince the natives to leave their tree, in able to attain the unobtainium. Jake learns in conclusion that there is nothing the natives want and refuse to move from their home, therefore humans take force and destroy their home. The Na'vi are not advanced people, they live among nature and are smart with which creatures they interact with. Because Jake learns the importance of being a Na'vi he begins to choose sides and understands what is morally right. Dilemmas arise due to the natives not trusting Jake for his betrayal-like actions, and humans don't because he refuses to help the humans fight the natives. What will turn out for Jake and where will the Na'vi people go? This movie is an action packed thriller with imaginative fun and fight distributed throughout the film. We are introduced to many creatures including the Ikran (a huge flying bird-like creature), and the pa'li (a large horse-like creature). These animals play a significant role in the movie's structure by adding awe inspiring moments and serenity. The film never feels long and concludes with the ultimate warfare that has a special element that comes as a true surprise"

      "text": "When you take away all the special effects and the multi million dollar budget, all you are left with is a mediocre script that feels like something that would have been better as a made for TV animated special. With that being said, the technical aspects are impressive and you can tell that a lot of effort went in to making this movie look great. However, you can only look at a piece of art so long before you start to get bored."

The story, though unoriginal, is still effective for this film. The dialogue, is bad sometimes, and decent in others. Definitely not a strong point. But if this film needs people to root for, its easy to tell who. If you want 3 hours of great visuals and nothing else, this is your movie."

It\u00b4s a really good created alter/reality that will hold your attention with ease during the entire ride. Visuals and atmosphere give this this movie an absolute a-status. The created world is absorbing your brain so bad that the average story won't bother you even 1 second. This one shines in utter  greatness!"

The CGI effects are marvelous and the realization of the world of Pandora is very detailed and persuasive. Having read cynical accounts of the plot as \"Dances with Smurfs\" I was also surprised by the story which was not exactly the strength of the movie but also didn't detract too much from the movie going experience. I feel a little sorry for people who become deeply attached to this movie and wrapped up in its reality...but on the other hand, I might even consider going to the movie again in the IMAX version."

      "text": "I had heard a lot about \"Avatar\" before seeing it, and the general complaint from most was the movie's lack of originality. Having seen the movie, I would agree that the premise is nowhere near unique, but to me originality shouldn't be the basis for judging the quality of a film. More than anything a truly great movie should be striking, and Avatar is precisely that. James Cameron used his budget ($237m) to create one of the most engrossing environments to ever grace the screen, and pushed the 3D technology (which I don't even like) to the limit. The result is pure spectacle; behind me in the movie theater there was a family with three children and throughout the 2 1/2 hours there were constant exclamations of \"Wow!\" and \"Oohh!\" I would have been slightly annoyed had I not realized I wanted to say the same things, and for a movie to revert a hardened critic like me to a world of pure escapist wonder, I have to give the film credit."

      "text": "AVATAR (or, as some seem to enjoy calling it, \"The Blue People Movie\", which really should be THE SMURFS, not this) is an adventurous, intense movie, and the best movie you can think of to be the highest-grossing film, both worldwide and in America.  Very few parts of this actually truly ticked me off, but there were a few to name: such as near the ending, when it began to get boring (a habit many creative sci-fi films such as even INCEPTION get into); and when Grace (Sigourney Weaver) died."

With very highly realistic environments, seeing it in 3D on the big screen is something magical. Assessing the film afterwards reveals a highly weak and wooden story that is just holding the film together with the visuals. Though the storyline is utter guff, the 'wow' moments might just make this a great film. Just."
