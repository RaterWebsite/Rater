The reason I will never forget this is because I still do. From the beginning, all the way until the end, I found this to be an absolute laugh riot. I enjoyed the entire cast. But, the performances that stood out in my mind were those of Billy Crystal and Carol Kane as Miracle Max and his wife, whose name I have totally forgotten. The way this film mixes rousing action with sidesplitting comedy is nothing short of amazing. Watch for a pre- Forrest Gump Robin Wright as Princess Buttercup. Now, THIS is how fantasy adventure-comedies should be made."

Even though the \"stars\" are Cary Elwes and Robin Wright, it is the supporting cast that makes this movie so enjoyable.  Andre the Giant is super in his \"goon squad\" role as Fezzig.  Wallace Shawn as Vizzini is \"inconceivably\" funny.  His mental duel with The Dread Pirate Roberts is classic.  Mandy Patikin and his quest for the Man with the Six Fingers blends in throughout;  his duel with Westley is one of the best sword fights I have seen in movie history.  Then there are the quick cameos of Billy Crystal and Carol Kane as the Miracle Man and his wife - another great scene.  Intermixing all of this is that the story is really being \"read\" by Peter Falk to his sick grandson, played by Fred Savage right before he started his Wonder Years period."

      "text": "I was completely unaware of this film until recently, when I heard it mentioned a couple of times as being a really great fantasy adventure -- so I gave it a watch. Unfortunately I felt pretty disappointed by it; given the hype, I was surprised by how weak it was in several key areas. The fantasy setting lacks a feeling of substance, and is just generally nondescript. This is not helped by the visual execution; the sets, visual effects and cinematography are bland and amateurish. The story itself is very by the numbers, and lacks momentum and emotional resonance. There's a framing device with a grandfather reading the story to his son, and while it was one of the better executed aspects of the film, I couldn't really see what it added. The characters are also generally rather clich\u00e9d -- the villains especially, and also the romantic duo, who lack any spark. Most of the acting is also uninspired or poor, the main exceptions being the main hero, who is played with an eccentric unflappability, and a vengeful swordsman, who has a sort of portentous magnetism. The interplay between these two near the start of the film was a high point, with good choreography and memorable dialogue. There are a good number of similarly memorable and witty lines throughout the film. This is the film's saving grace, and the main reason that I'm not giving it a bad score. But equally, that one aspect on its own can't make up for the film's many deficits. In conclusion, I can see how the film's quotability could make it entertaining for repeat viewings of a devoted fanbase, and how the cheesiness and clich\u00e9s could be endearing. But personally I found that the cheesiness felt more like poor workmanship, and the clich\u00e9s weren't self-aware or entertaining, but the result of blandness."

Stardust is very similar, I think that movie was copying this. I didn't like Stardust either, it is just as cheesy and boring as this, and I think stardust picked the wrong movie to copy. This to me was almost the same as Stardust, but it was so cheesy. Its so stupid how they don't even kill Humperdink, its a weak, weak movie. And they run out of ideas once they leave the fire swamp. After that they use the worste techniques, with an annoying Billy Crystal, and obsessesed characters. To me, the last half hour ruined everything."

There are a few good scenes; the swordfight and the game of riddles, for example, but a lot of the time it's quite dull.

      "text": "An incredibly fun and still impressively fresh and unique take on the romantic comedy and fairy tale genres, The Princess Bride is a true crowd pleaser. Funny, adventurous, and romantic, there are not many demographics that are missed here. Incredibly well-written and quite well-directed by Rob Reiner. The film's pacing is quite assured and could be well-advised to cool off a bit, especially in the beginning, but it is never truly a glaring problem. Cary Elwes, Robin Wright, Mandy Patinkin, Andre the Giant, and especially Billy Crystal are all great and turn in hilariously over-the-top performances. The sequence with Crystal stands out as the best in the film due to its comedic elements. On that note, the film is not quite as funny as I anticipated, but is very, very funny all the same. It expertly blends this comedy with a captivating adventure tale and a very touching and well-crafted romance fitting for its fairy tale approach. Overall, The Princess Bride is a classic for a reason and it is not hard to find out why: charm."

      "text": "The Princess Bride was originally a book written by William Goldman in 1973 and he turned it into a screenplay 10 years later. The movie, like the book is a classical story of true love, overcoming all the odds to find happiness, and it also happens to be one of the rare cases where the movie is as good as the book.\r One of the things that makes this movie so great is the unique way that the story is told. All too often when a book is created into a movie it is just a retelling of the book without its own twist on the story or way to make it more than a retelling, and more often than not if a movie adds its own twist it completely ruins the story. The Princess Bride is an exception to that rule, the whole premise for the movie is a sick young boy, played by Fred Savage, and his grandfather, played by Peter Falk, gives him The Princess Bride for a present and starts to read it to him. This inventive way to tell the story allowed the writers to go from scenes from the book back to the grandson\u2019s bedroom, adding humor and creating suspense. This combined with the fact that because the writer of the screenplay and the book was the same person, which helped keep the movie\u2019s storyline very close to the book\u2019s storyline, makes this movie better than any other movie I\u2019ve seen that was based on a book.\r Another thing that makes it such a good movie is it\u2019s diversity in it\u2019s themes. It\u2019s largest theme that encompasses the whole is that true love conquers all. Now that is a theme that, although may not always be true in real life, we all love because it makes us feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Another theme that it has is that the evil people in the world get what they deserve. This is another very watchable theme, who doesn\u2019t like seeing the good guys win? The two very inspiring and heart-warming themes can make the audience get emotionally involved with the character in the movie. I found myself rooting for character and hoping that others died.\r The final thing that makes this movie so incredible is the way they build the characters. The characters in the movie are not just cookie cutter characters. They all have a good and a bad side that is built up throughout the movie by their interaction with other characters. Even the hero of the story has a bad side, he cheats to win a battle of wits. The dynamics of the characters really add to the story.\r Overall, The Princess Bride is an incredibly well done movie with great actors to play dynamic characters, touching themes, and a very unique way to tell the story. It is a must see for all of those who haven\u2019t seen it and a movie you will want to watch again. If you don\u2019t believe me or if you think it will be boring I leave you this quote from the movie. \u201cAre you kidding? Its got fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love, miracles.\u201d"

Rob Reiner is a very good director indeed, directing films like Stand By Me and all that. The film itself is beautiful, with lovely sets and costumes, matched with a funny and touching script, not to mention quotable. The story was simple, but very well-developed, with a few surprises here and there. As for the acting, it is superb. Cary Elwes is a very charismatic lead as Westley, and Robin Wright gives a very spirited performance as Princess Buttercup. Chris Sarandon is a little annoying, but he has some delicious throw-away lines, so you warm to him, especially when Westley insults him at the end. Wallace Shawn, Andre the Giant and Christopher Guest(who bares a mere resemblance to Tim Curry's Cardinal Richelieu) were very good too, as is an unrecognisable Billy Crystal. And Mandy Patinkin is deliciously hammy as the man who wishes to avenge his father's death by killing his six-fingered murderer. But what impressed me most were the funny interruptions with the grandfather(played wonderfully by Colombo's Peter Falk)and his sick grandson(Fred Savage). All in all, an original and funny movie that is a must see. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox."
