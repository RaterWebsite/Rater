Which is respectively hard to follow for an incredibly tired and not so-sober individual. It wasn't until a year or so later, I saw the film was on tv and decided to watch it again. Given I hardly remembered what even happened in it. Let's just say after paying attention to the detail in this film, I was blown-back by it's style and atmosphere. Scott did very well in creating a realistic and believable gritty future; while also being able to capture how such a world alienates and disillusions it's residents. It's a beautiful social commentary and deals with many philosophical ideas, while never telling you any definite answers to them. It's definitely one of the best narrative uses of a sci-fi setting, and deserves all of its recognition and praise."

There's a lot of the story which is implausible, and, dare I say it, quite dull. Great performances make this worth watching (particularly the world weary cop Harrison Ford doing his best Philip Marlow impression) and of course Rutger Hauer. For me the real treat of this film is the uncompromising dystopian future depicted by Ridley Scott, with great special effects by Douglas Trumbull and of course a brilliant score by Vangelis. Bears little resemblance to the book by Philip K Dick; the film is essentially a 1940's film noir detective story set in the future."

The pacing allows plenty of time for reflection (and to soak up the haunting soundtrack) without dragging. All in all, a transcendent viewing experience."

      "text": "It's the big ideas behind its iconic visuals that really makes Blade Runner such a great science-fiction film. Covering wide-ranging themes including what it means to be human, free will, future off-world colonisation, the meaning of dreams and the nature of reality, it's certainly a cerebral viewing experience. Ridley Scott is a master of genre-crossing - Alien was a hybrid of science-fiction and several sub-genres of horror, and Blade Runner is a science-fiction-noir. You've got the iconography and narrative structure of dark detective fiction encased in a radical, industrialised future city that appears as a strangely organic fusion of Eastern and Western culture. Though he reportedly had a bad time shooting the film, Harrison Ford gives one of the standout performances of his career as Rick Deckard, a weary hard-boiled detective who looks as though he's stepped straight out of a pulp detective novel. Daryl Hannah's impish and sinister take on a female fugitive android impresses as well, as does Edward James Olmos's mysterious mostly-silent detective Gaff - he doesn't say much, but his actions speak louder than words ever could. However, it's Rutger Hauer who really steals the show as Roy, the unhinged leader of the renegade \"replicants\" who Deckard is hunting, his performance a pitch-perfect deliverance of creepy-cool, and he gives one of the best farewell monologues on film (Haur responsible for choosing the most affecting parts of a speech written by David Webb Peoples) where Roy professes his humanity in moving, poetic verse as rain cascades down his grieving face. Vangellis' eerie, layered electronic score also helps no end to add further richness and emotion to the film. I'm not quite sure why there's still a debate about the implications of the film's final scene - it's pretty obvious what Scott intended. Blade Runner is undeniably one of the most influential of science-fiction films, and is an interesting modern take on a film noir to boot. I can't really say that I think Blade Runner is better that Scott's previous foray into sci-fi - yes there's another shadowy, amoral super-corporation pulling strings behind the scenes, but beyond that, Alien is just too different to compare. I sincerely hope Scott stops plundering his back-catalogue of successes at some point and moves onto something new, what with Prometheus being such a mixed bag of a film. There's a Prometheus sequel and another film in the Blade Runner universe in the works, which is more than a little worrying, and makes me wonder whether we should forcibly remove Ridley Scott's science-fiction crown before he really embarrasses himself."

This movie is brilliant and one of the best sci-fi films out there. But it also embodies the film noir genre really well too. The music is very good and with every scene it fits perfectly. The visuals in this movie works so well and Douglas Trumball's special effects are brilliant, the city looks beautiful. I also like the look of this future and it fits within the story perfectly. Each and every one of the characters is complex and it's interesting to watch. Rutger Hauer gives such an amazing performance, his speech in the climax is just as beautiful as some of the imagery from the film, and is also one of my favourite movie scenes.  This movie marks a great moment in cinema, one of the best out there."

      "text": "Beautifully shot neon noir journey inside a dystopic alternate 2019 Los Angeles wherein interplanetary colonisation is a reality made possible by the work of an army of synthetic humans aka 'replicants'. Harrison Ford stars as the titular Blade runner tasked with 'retiring' a group of rogue androids determined to extend their limited 3 year lifespans. The 2007 final cut edit is superbly paced and pieced together sans the awful voice over narration that haunted the theatrical release. The screenplay is rich and weird, with many enigmatic characters played by the extremely talented cast. 1982's Blade runner holds up well today and has been well complimented with a tasteful sequel. I remember I first watched the directors cut on channel 4 back in the nineties and it blew my mind again and again requiring multiple watches for my young mind to appreciate the nuances this film encapsulates. Stands alongside Alien as Ridley Scott's best work and is seminal to the cyberpunk genre."

      "text": "In the nearly 25 years since its original release, Blade Runner has become one of the most discussed, debated, and influential science fiction movies. These days, it's almost impossible to find a gritty science fiction motion picture that doesn't owe at least a small debt to Blade Runner's visual style. The movie is also one of the first major motion pictures to have been given a red carpet \"Director's Edition.\" In cooperation with Warner Brothers, Ridley Scott re-tooled the movie, making minor changes and eliminating the much-maligned voiceover. In late 1992, the new version was released in a limited number of theaters and was universally acclaimed as the \"definitive version\" by fans worldwide.\r Considering how respected Blade Runner is in the 2000s, it's difficult to remember that it was widely viewed as a failure during its initial release. Reviews, for the most part, were negative. (This isn't surprising. Cutting-edge science fiction is often viewed negatively at first then re-evaluated later. 2001 is a classic example.) The box office was tepid, and the film failed to make back its production costs. Viewers, expecting something more popcorn-oriented from a Harrison Ford science fiction movie, were disappointed by the dark, serious nature of the project. The cast and crew, who had nearly rebelled against the director during production, were in some cases unenthusiastic in their support of the finished product.\r The central ethical question posed by Blade Runner has been popular in science fiction since it\u2019s the inception of the genre: what is life? It's the same issue pondered by Mary Shelly in Frankenstein, translated into the far future. Man is no longer building misshapen creatures out of disused body parts. Now the creatures are nearly perfect replicas of human beings. They live, eat, drink, make love, think, feel, and perish. But do they have souls? Is Deckard merely consigning scrap to the slag heap or is he killing? That question has worn on him. According to Bryant, he's the best there ever was, but that was in the past. Now, he's burned out.\r Blade Runner is as much of a morality play as it is an action/adventure story. The question of whether or not the replicants are \"alive\" echoes themes from countless novels, movies, and television series. It lies at the heart of Issac Asimov's I, Robot (both the book and the movie). It's central to the premise of the current TV series Battlestar Galactica (which borrows Blade Runner's \"skinjob\" slang to describe human-looking androids). Blade Runner didn't invent the issue but it arguably did more to popularize it than any other post-Asimov source.\r Those expecting to see Harrison Ford in full Han Solo/Indiana Jones action hero mode are primed for disappointment. Deckard is still capable of getting the job done, but he's not gung-ho about it. He's a reluctant cop, and his reluctance becomes more apparent as the movie unfolds. He's also not the blade runner he used to be. He does the job, but gets the hell kicked out of him on several occasions and, without Rachael's timely intervention when he confronts Leon, he wouldn't be around to chase Pris and Roy.\r The final confrontation between Deckard and Roy is atypical of an action movie. The formula requires that these two engage in a long, hard one-on-one struggle before Deckard vanquishes Roy. That's not what happens. The fight occurs, but Deckard is the loser. Roy saves him, even though he has every reason to let Deckard die. The two end up spending Roy's last hours together, waiting for his four-year life to end. Why does Roy save Deckard? Perhaps, recognizing that the end is at hand, Roy doesn't want to die alone. His companions are no more; Deckard is the only one who will stay with him. This action, more than any other, argues for the \"humanity\" of the replicants. What could be more human than to not want to die alone?\r Blade Runner is not flawless. There is an irritating continuity error pertaining to the number of replicants who made it to Earth. (The original number is six, with one killed. However, Deckard is given only four profiles to track down.) The love story with Rachael doesn't work, in large part because both Ford and Sean Young underplay their roles to such extremes that its impossible to believe either could feel anything for the other. The romance is necessary to the story and it emphasizes the blurred line between men and replicants but it fails on an emotional level.\r Blade Runner is a rare science fiction movie so full of material that pages can be written about it without scratching the surface. A review like this can provide little more than an overview. A detailed exploration of the movie, its style, and its mysteries requires dedication that only someone immersed in Blade Runner lore can provide."

Even though I am watching it today, I can still see how revolutionary it was back when it first released. While its depiction of the year 2019 is a bit too ambitious, it still displays an amazing world and aesthetic for the sci-fi genre. Harrison Ford as Deckard is great. But its also the direction, the writing, the other performances, the production design, and the unique music that set Blade Runner apart from any other movie. It truly is a one of a kind film, one that will be hard to do justice in its upcoming sequel."

The ambiance of Vangelis' score and production design are just out of this world. Phenomenal work in every way. Directing by Ridley Scott is at his finest to date, the rainy atmosphere just feet perfectly to this story driven by agent Deckard wonderfully portrayed with a top notch Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer is coldest as possible as we even imagine this is really a replicant for some moments. All the visual effects are spectacular and still very effective as the today standard. The story is loosely based on the Philip K Dick novel but have is own approach that perfectly feet to Ridley Scott own vision of the story. Every sequences are unforgettable and the final is just perfect! Near to reach the prefect 10 rating. The Final Cut of the film have some sequences and color treatments altered so this deacrese the rate from 9 to 8 in my opinion. And then the theatrical version, the international version and the now official workprint version are all far from what the final versions are.

      "text": "This is probably one of my favorite movies of all time and I think it will continue to be for as long as I'm around.  The world that Scott created in this film reeks of depth, style, and an ambiance that many films can only struggle to grasp, which to me is very impressive considering that this was done before the special effects revolution of the 90's and 2000's.  The story revolves around a retired blade-runner; a cop that specializes in hunting rogue replicants (synthetic humans), named Deckard (Harrison Ford), who is brought out of retirement to hunt down a group of replicants who have arrived on Earth.  The movie does an excellent job of casting the characters of the movie in many shades of grey, with no one character being truly good or evil, and also poses some interesting questions as to the nature of humanity and what defines us.  The films visuals are inspired; the term \"film noir\" is very fitting for it, but may seem slower paced to those used to more modern \"action\" films with their rapid fire cuts.  Where many films seem to have action just for the sake of it (cough, Michael cough Bay, cough), Scott's action scenes have more of a purpose to further the narrative.  It takes some getting used to, but the slower pace fits the concept better, and only adds more to the feeling of loss, stagnation, and oppression of living in that future society.  The music is very ambient, with a synth sound to it, and although I don't usually like that kind of thing, it does compliment the film well and adds to the overall mood.  Ford, Olmos (who only has a small role, but somehow makes the most of it), Hauer, Young, and Hannah all give strong performances, and although most of them play their roles somewhat subdued (which fits the future world they live in well), it's ironic (and most likely on purpose) that the most passionate and human-like of all the characters are the replicants themselves.  It's an interesting notion that the humans are portrayed as much more cynical and full of despondency, while the shorter life-spanned replicants seem to embody a passion for life that they seem to have lost.  This movie is deep, but not for everyone.  People who have short attention spans or no interest in entertaining ideas about humanity and our future should probably stay away.  Those who love a story about a man struggling to find his humanity in the desolate landscape of the future, cool visuals, or just sci-fi in general owe it to themselves to see the movie that influenced countless movies, TV series, books, music, and video games, and will continue to do so for a long time."

Watch this film and then watch it again a week or two later......let it \"digest\". Like a fine wine, it ages gracefully!"

I'd recommend watching the former before the latter to fully appreciate the difference. Practically every sci-fi film since has tried to copy Blade runner. So you might get some deja vu watching Blade runner, but remember, it came first."

      "text": "In the nearly 25 years since its original release, Blade Runner has become one of the most discussed, debated, and influential science fiction movies. These days, it's almost impossible to find a gritty science fiction motion picture that doesn't owe at least a small debt to Blade Runner's visual style. The movie is also one of the first major motion pictures to have been given a red carpet \"Director's Edition.\" In cooperation with Warner Brothers, Ridley Scott re-tooled the movie, making minor changes and eliminating the much-maligned voiceover. In late 1992, the new version was released in a limited number of theaters and was universally acclaimed as the \"definitive version\" by fans worldwide.\r Considering how respected Blade Runner is in the 2000s, it's difficult to remember that it was widely viewed as a failure during its initial release. Reviews, for the most part, were negative. (This isn't surprising. Cutting-edge science fiction is often viewed negatively at first then re-evaluated later. 2001 is a classic example.) The box office was tepid, and the film failed to make back its production costs. Viewers, expecting something more popcorn-oriented from a Harrison Ford science fiction movie, were disappointed by the dark, serious nature of the project. The cast and crew, who had nearly rebelled against the director during production, were in some cases unenthusiastic in their support of the finished product.\r Blade Runner is as much of a morality play as it is an action/adventure story. The question of whether or not the replicants are \"alive\" echoes themes from countless novels, movies, and television series. It lies at the heart of Issac Asimov's I, Robot (both the book and the movie). It's central to the premise of the current TV series Battlestar Galactica (which borrows Blade Runner's \"skinjob\" slang to describe human-looking androids). Blade Runner didn't invent the issue but it arguably did more to popularize it than any other post-Asimov source.\r Those expecting to see Harrison Ford in full Han Solo/Indiana Jones action hero mode are primed for disappointment. Deckard is still capable of getting the job done, but he's not gung-ho about it. He's a reluctant cop, and his reluctance becomes more apparent as the movie unfolds. He's also not the blade runner he used to be. He does the job, but gets the hell kicked out of him on several occasions and, without Rachael's timely intervention when he confronts Leon, he wouldn't be around to chase Pris and Roy.\r Blade Runner is not known for action set pieces. There are four, each associated with the death of a replicant. The most exaggerated are the conflicts between Deckard and Pris and Deckard and Roy, but there's nothing in either to match the elaborate workings of Ford's previous movie, Raiders of the Lost Ark. Blade Runner delivers its share of tension and suspense, but Ridley Scott's intention with this film was to make something worth thinking about not just a mindless jolt of adrenaline.\r The movie is loosely based on Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep by Philip K. Dick, and it represents the first time any of the prolific science fiction author's works was adapted for a motion picture. Reportedly, Dick was pleased with the result even though Blade Runner diverged considerably from his story. What most impressed Dick was the look of the film and that has become Blade Runner's legacy. The mixture of high technology (air cars) and poverty (fires in trash cans) results in indelible images. Blade Runner takes place in darkness and rain. The film noir influences are evident, but so are the science fictions ones. Scott's ability to fuse these two has created a blueprint that dozens of other \"serious\" science fiction films have followed. The Blade Runner look is in direct contrast to the antiseptic appearance of Star Wars and Star Trek, the reigning science fiction poster franchises of the day. (Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan was released three weeks prior to Blade Runner in 1982.)\r Blade Runner is a rare science fiction movie so full of material that pages can be written about it without scratching the surface. A review like this can provide little more than an overview. A detailed exploration of the movie, its style, and its mysteries requires dedication that only someone immersed in Blade Runner lore can provide. Currently, the film is available in the United States only in the director's cut. Warner Brothers, however, has promised an exhaustive box set next year with multiple versions. It will be interesting to see whether those editions offer new insights or expand upon the film's already rich tapestry."

This is possibly my favorite movie of all time; definitely my favorite sci-fi movie of all time.\r The plot can be hard to follow, but after viewing it multiple times, I found it to be very fascinating and rich with themes like religion, death and man's reliance on technology. It's the sort of plot that will leave you thinking even after the end credits have rolled.\r The main characters of Deckard (Harrison Ford) & Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) are equally compelling, much of which is due to the outstanding performances of both actors. Roy Batty's poetic \"Tears in the Rain\" speech is in my mind one of the most memorable monologues in movie history.\r If you can't appreciate the film's story, you can at least appreciate it as a visual spectacle. This is one of the most beautifully shot movies that I have ever seen. The shots of the neon-filled city are breathtaking, & the imagery plays off of the movie's themes to the letter.\r The futuristic dystopian city of LA is absolutely jaw-dropping, and makes you want to see more of this world. Greek composer Vangelis helps bring this world to life with his unique score, a beautiful symphony of futuristic synthesizers."

      "text": "Always been a fan of a good scifi movie... I was like 6 when this came out and didn't watch it back then and for some reason never got around to watching it until recently. I've been told numerous times this was a classic, one of the best of the genre. Well wait, I did watch it like 10 years ago after a friend told me it was his favorite movie of all times and I honestly don't remember any of it, other than I felt it was pretty boring. So a couple months ago I watched it and fell asleep on it... and now I finally got around to watching it fully, well rested and with no expectations.I just feel the jell-o doesn't take hold... It seems like the whole plot is very shallow and uneventful. Throughout the movie, you don't quite get what the runaway replicants want exactly and by the time you do, they pretty much learn they can't do anything about it... Then it just becomes a succession of extremely cheesy action scenes (the whole JF Sebastian apartment ending, geez man, give me a break).Overall, it was a pretty excruciating experience to watch. Granted, it was ahead of it's time and there was a lot of originality, but story-wise, it was in my opinion terrible. I hope Denis Villeneuve's upcoming follow up mops the floor with this, won't be hard IMHO."

Same thing with the sequel, but ryn gosling was the one that put me to sleep in that one. Same dead expression on his face. If you imagine a better actor in the role with charisma and range in the role it is still really boring. I'll never get it, sorry, i tried nerds ;)"

      "text": "There are many problems with Blade Runner, but let us start with the positives. First, the setting is great. The futuristic city they built is beautiful and amazingly huge in scope. In addition, the general feel of the film is cool and the lighting is perfect. The acting is also solid. However, beyond this, the film is a trainwreck. The story is terrible. It is overly complex and nearly impossible to follow, even if you pay attention. The action is stupid and poorly done. The script is lacking as well. The film is not slow, but it never really hooks you in. I was never made to care about anything that happened. In addition, the ending is terrible, largely because it creepy and borderline sadistic, which completely turned me off and made me entirely repulsed. For a film that is now considered a classic, I find myself agreeing with the initial negative reception."

I have to say that the latter is the stronger film thanks in large part to its more ambiguous ending.  The absence of Ford's narration isn't a major problem although it does help to clarify a couple of plot points.  As for the film itself, it's visually stunning and has aged extremely well but the story is clunky and there's no human element to connect with."

      "text": "It goes far, but it doesn't go far enough. The world of the machine is not explored as deeply as I would have liked, in order to truly cement this as a classic film. Nevertheless, it stands on its own as a defining sci-fi noir film that really everyone should see who has an interest in the genre. Harrison Ford plays essentially Harrison Ford, but as a detective, and he does a very decent job satisfying the old, disgruntled lawman that he's supposed to play. Brion James plays a delightfully crazy android, aided by a brief but memorable performance by Daryl Hannah. The story weaves together expertly in this crime drama, but the characters really drive the plot along. This is important, because at about two hours in length, this film can seem slow to anyone who is more used to fast-paced modern science fiction. However, tension builds and the climax is worth it for those who are willing to give it a shot. All in all, its accolades are well-deserved, even if it doesn't make my personal favorite science fiction films list. This may be Ridley Scott's defining masterpiece in his ouevre.Verdict: Movie Win"
