      "text": "Better than I thought it was going to be, it's funny and manages to be a great parody of spy movies, granted you can see some bigger Johnny English's screw ups coming they still turn out funny do to good acting, not sure I would show this to younger audiences, but maybe kids about 13 and up, still if you like goofy spy parody movies then this is for you."

      "text": "I only need to say this simply... Johnny English is a hilarious and fun-filled movie that is full to the brim with silly gags and crazy action. It's the most funny film I've ever seen, and I'll never forget the first time I watched it, I just couldn't stop laughing. It may be a little technically flawed, but the pure hilarity makes up for that.\rAs comedy films go, I'd say this is the best out there, as it does what it intends to brilliantly  make people laugh (or make me laugh). So I give this film a... 90/100!"

      "rating": "5",
      "text": "Some comedies are very underrated due to the fact they are stupid and nonsensical. Johnny English is a solid comedy movie thanks to Rowan Atkinson's performance, but the movie itself is too predictable and too dumb that doesn't provide enough laughs to convince the audience."

      "rating": "5",
      "text": "WHAT I LIKED: An amusing take on spy spoofs, 'Johnny English' is a lot of fun. This is mainly thanks to Rowan Atkinson who takes his every role onto the next level\rWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: It suffers from an over-abundance of silliness that makes it so unbelieveable you occassionaly struggle to laugh (for example, the entire ending sequence) You have no care for the mission or the character as it lacks overall conviction\rVERDICT: A funny but mostly ridiculous spy spoof."

      "text": "There are always going to be movies of a particular sort where critics just don't do justice to the value of what the movie bring to the table.Johnny English is simply that sort of a movie. There are two simple reasons to watch this movie despite any hindrances you may face:1) Rowan Atkinson - The man can make anything sound and seem funny, especially when he has to (try to) be serious. And supported by the character foil that is Bob, it is hilarious riot throughout.2) John Malkovich - His french accent in portraying Pascal Sauvage is a hearkening to the the characters that bring the wacky narcissistic psycho-babble that is Malkovich Malkovich.Plus Lorna Campbell is an almost Bond babe, if Bond were to be arrogant pompous British failure whose stature is far too overstated... well, there you go."
