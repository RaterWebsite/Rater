BUT this movie was actually pretty interesting and decent. Believable characters, interesting story, heck even the soundtrack had something! Especially John Heard, Erin Karpluk and Dominic Purcell sold me on their characters. I have to agree that the ending is a bit \"I don't think it would be this way\", but hey the rest was  as I said  pretty decent. So as much as it hurts me, I have to give this movie a 8, because I wasn't bored a second while watching it while the ending being the only little downside of it."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "excellent movie, hit on all points of the wall street mafia criminals who suck-up wealth from the entire American population. confiscation of Americans wealth thru printing of paper money-inflation-graduated tax system-- ensure the u.s. private central bank (federal 'reserve) get more and more of American's earnings. the terrorists live on wall street and in the fed bank and quietly kill many American's thru confiscation and theft of American's wealth. but that is ok...they usually do not use guns in your face but use computer systems and political spin. no blood on the street, so, no crime, eh?\rgreat, great movie....material that mainstream-production studios, tied to the white house, know better than to touch, as do 'a' list movie stars. all actors-actresses had guts being in this movie...THEY are patriots. the wall streeters are terrorists and traitors against America. they will burn it all down. this movie points the way and yes, you too, are in for it. just wait. in 10 years kids, your dollars will buy little to nothing.\rwe knew, we knew, we knew, main street critics would hate hate hate this movie!!! knew it. it exposes the white asses of their masters, the wall street boys and the fed bank boys. look for more 'independent' movies like this AND expect the same reviews by main stream critics....the main stream critics must slam movies like these....their masters order them and pay them well to slam it. hey critic boys, you and your masters will lose. we will bring you down."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This film is a nice movie, have a contemporary approach to social problems, have in mind the low budget too, you cant expect the lord of the rings with a budget like this. may sound dangerous but is a cathartic experience.

Again, only if this is what you're looking for.\r The build-up they give you for revenge fodder is fantastic... the main character is a badass and the underlying message is anti-capitalism and shows you just how powerless honest working people are. The great part about the main character are his responses in the movie, he's a simple honest working man and has the simplicity of Rambo.\r If you're pissed off because the economy and politics this will help relax you. To be honest I'm not sure how they got away with doing this movie. I loved it, for what it was, not what it could be.\r A few gripes that could have made it better:\r- a little more dialogue with the main character (i.e. when he's getting the shaft from the lawyer)\r- perhaps a bit more artistic license from the perspective of the main character and how he's feeling.\r The speech by Mr. Corporate at the end was a shocker, again, how the hell did they get away with this. Surprised it wasn't banned."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Why are these type of movies even allowed to be released. Killing everyone related to certain profession because one or two of them were reason of his bad investment. Unbelievable How could people even find entertainment in watching a guy shoot random peoples?"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I wonder if people actually watch this movie before writing bad reviews  I just saw this movie, and found it to be very good. I think  what people expect nowadays is big holly wood  explosions, and computer graphics   In this movie the acting is solid, and the plot is plausible, and the ending is surprising  Truth is you owe it to yourself not to listen to paid critics  whom may or may not have an  agenda   Rate it for  yourself  you won't be disappointed"}, {"rating": "2", "text": "It's a movie with an heartbreaking and touching beginning, where you see a realistic drop of someone who lose everything. Then, it becomes a movie full of free violence, presenting people getting killed only. The fact is, in the first and the second act, the movie tries to bring an intelligent point of view in interesting ways. In the third act, they try to brainwash you in a way too clear for me to just accept it. The part where the CEO just admits he's the bad one and that he just laugh at poor people without remorse was just too much."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "This is without doubt one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Bad cardboard acting, cliche characters, awful soundtrack, lame 80's cinematography and a ridiculous and morally bankrupt premise. This film is absolutely atrocious."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Assault On Wall Street is nothing like you expect it to be, at least not until the last 15 minutes. Jim Baxford (Dominic Purcell) is a normal, hard working, family man, until his wife gets sick. Through a series of hardships Jim and his family go bankrupt, leading to an unspeakable act, that causes Jim to lose control. This film had all the makings of a terrific action movie, but that's not what we got. For over an hour, we watch the story of Jim's life slowly pass us by. What should have taken 25 minutes, takes up almost the entirety of the film, it was absolutely ridiculous! We meet Jim and his family, see what the issues are, and then, nothing for quite a while. Prison Break's Dominic Purcell stars in this thing and he is one of the best young action stars they could have gotten to star in this movie. It just really drives me crazy to see how obtuse the writers of these films can be. The lead character was cast, almost to perfection, while at the same time, you have a relatively good story to build upon, yet the film goes nowhere! By the time anything actually happened here, I was already fed up and disinterested. Assault On Wall Street looked like it was going to be a can't miss action/thriller. Instead, bad directing and perfectionist writers just completely destroy everything they have going for them and deliver a film that eventually becomes unwatchable."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Assault on Wall Street is just another action movie but atleast its a action movie with a point and message instead save some bs.\r Dominic Purcell does a decent acting job tho cant hit the sad parts blame the director not doing his job.\rErin Karpluk does a great job all around.\r The movie doesn't really offer much in the action but it has a decent story that happens in reality too much and the movie does a fine job at sending the message."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I could not believe it was made by the director who is famous for his crap movies. When he had the most popular names in his kit, he gave nonsense movie 'In the Name of King'. For me 'Rampage' was his best movie though it was only okay type. I thought he could never make a better movie than that but surprised me and everybody with this. Yeah I liked it very much, the movie with not much famous actors in it which is almost a B movie. The 'Prison Break' actor gave the brilliant performance. The character like his are quite famous nowadays like one from the 'Death Race' who loses everything and go after for who did it.\r Jim is a lower middle class family lives with his beloved wife Rosie. Rosie is a sick and need to be treated every day. The income won't pay for their required costly medicines but theirs invest in the stock market do. They are happy until the market begins to crash which forces them to lose everything they had. Now Jim is clueless about his future, as an ex military man he takes the law in hand to avenge his loss. How he does and who are all his victims are the remaining.\r I presumed it would be a drama like 'Wall Street' duology but I am glad it was different. There are some flaws in the story, like his targets for revenge were so stupid. You can't just pick everybody to avenge for your downfall. The end shootout scene was so silly. Shooting everyone including innocents who come across is brainless who call himself 'the fighter' for poor people. As a movie it is entertaining, but if you compare it to reality it is so stupid. All the above leaving hint to return in a sequel was really not a cool. This movie is purely for an entertainment and don't overlook more than that."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This movie makes a good point, we shouldn't let these  holes play with our money and economy. There should really be a huge hit on how much they can money they can risk. If so then we can give them a piece of our minds show em that this isn't a game."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "I was shocked. Really shocked. I can't even believe how shocked I was. The film was not terrible, nor good but actually DECENT. With that being said, Uwe has made a film that I found to be occasionally good. It had It's flaws, but after viewing this you can't help but to nod and say \"Congratulations\"."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Jim really kicked those god damned Capitalists ass!Very very nice film.Jim really have no choice.He had to do that.And I like his friends too!They were always stand with Jim."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Assault on Wall Street is a good movie, not a great movie or a movie you'll want to watch again anytime soon, but it's a good movie. It's a revenge themed movie that works well for what it is. The set up involving a armored car security guard and his sick wife dealing with compounding medical bills that force them into a debt spiral they can't get out of touchs real life in America these days. The first half of the movie does a good job of setting up what makes Jim seek revenge. We're able to sympathize with Jim during these moments and see how he could come to this conclusion. The way it's acted though is another story, some of the actors in this film are a little surprising. Veteran actor Keith David has a role as an NYPD officer who's been in the vice grip of debt before, we also have Edward Furlong playing Jim's best friend and co-worker. Both of these actors do well in their roles and it's nice to see Edward trying to rebuild his acting career. The main character though, Jim, played by Dominc Purcell comes off as just above wooden. He seems like a great guy, but he would come off in real life as creepy, someone you would keep your guard up around. He delivers a fair performance, but I think someone else could of played the part just a little better. The second half of the movie is where it begins to hit the fan as Jim loses it and takes out his frustration and anger against those on Wall Street and for the most part these scenes are done quite well. The action is good and Uwe Boll doesn't shy away from showing some blood and gore. The ending is somewhat of a mixed bag for me, as I kinda agree with it, yet think it shouldn't have happened another way. Assault on Wall Street won't become a action classic, but it 's worth a watch, especially if you hate the **** on Wall Street."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This movie is hard to watch, you will not like what you see in this film. But it is what happens in capitalism. uwe is capable of delivering very good movies."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Yes a movie but realistic to a person if in your head was a movie and can get away with it. Shows the actions of hard working honest working people with the loss and back against the wall and trying to do the good thing and still in a corner. I would recommend the movie."}], "recommendations": ["four_brothers", "the_purge_anarchy", "limitless", "death_wish", "olympus_has_fallen", "taken", "code_8", "the_6th_day", "law_abiding_citizen", "snitch", "contagion", "the_tax_collector", "the_purge", "the_kingdom", "no_escape", "never_back_down", "the_guardian", "savages", "hitman_agent_47", "machete", "repo_men", "sas_red_notice", "gone_in_sixty_seconds", "live_by_night", "jumper"]}
