      "text": "Longing for the American dream should never be inextricable from the determination of an individual. Dreaming about achieving a goal should go hand in hand with proactively doing it.  Without veering off on a transcendentalist tangent, let me introduce Kenny Wells. Wells is a pot-bellied, greased up chain smoking alcoholic, perhaps uncomfortably seen as the heir to the throne of the Washoe Mining Company based in \u2018the biggest little city in the world\u2019 and where Johnny Cash sang of a prisoner shooting a man, \u2018just to watch him die\u2019. The one and only, Reno, Nevada.  So maybe I haven\u2019t painted Wells in such a great light so far.  He certainly isn\u2019t the godchild of Emerson, but that\u2019s what director Stephen Gaghan appears to try and convey.  This is Oscar winner Matthew McConaughey as you\u2019ve never witnessed before, presented in a way that\u2019s far from an idealised sharp-suited image of the American dreamer and stoically opposed to Ron Woodward\u2019s skeletal frame in his winning performance in 2013\u2019s \u2018Dallas Buyers Club\u2019.  However, he\u2019s the film\u2019s gleaming treasure in a somewhat clich\u00e9d quest for glory, even if the main aesthetic shine is only from his forehead in an Indonesian jungle.\u2018Gold\u2019 is loosely based upon the Bre-X mining scandal of 1993 with Gaghan confusingly transporting us straight back to the 1980s to a world of questionable suits, post-punk, Iggy Pop and the romantic aspirations of Wells.  His journey is somewhat instigated by the death of his father, luring him further into the volatile and unpredictable world of gold mining, conducting the train through its successes and abrupt halts.  From the smoky testosterone filled bars of Reno to the sweat inducing tropics of Borneo, we realise how integral McConaughey\u2019s performance is to the success and believability of the narrative.  Although somewhat charismatic through his wittiness and general naivety to the overall project, Kenny Wells is a man who is out to make money.  Wells\u2019 sidekick, geologist Michael Acosta (Edgar Ramirez), is bestowed with elements of morality and spirituality, clearly seen in his proactive interaction with the Indonesian people.  So therefore, Wells\u2019 financial determination combined with Acosta\u2019s endearing qualities and intelligence make the relationship such a strong focal point of the film.  The strength of the characters makes the adventure seem almost tangible, yet still questionable.Looking at McConaughey\u2019s transformation, you may just begin to question how Kaylene (Bryce Dallas-Howard) has fallen for such a downtrodden hopeless wanderer.  However it\u2019s her innocent undying belief in him that makes Wells\u2019 decline even more forceful.  There is an essence of the childhood sweetheart in her demeanour, the archetypal support mechanism to Kenny\u2019s weaknesses.  Yes, she rides on the wave of success to its highest heights with Wells, lavishing herself in material riches but in a way, she is the moral spine of the film, never losing sight of the real Kenny Wells she\u2019s grown up loving.  Kaylene acts just as much as the voice of reason as Michael Acosta and it is the combination of powerful relationships that we will really take away from the screen.  The dizzying heights of financial success ultimately lead to a strenuous, yet somewhat predictable breakdown between Kenny and Kaylene and we can\u2019t help but feel like she is completely unworthy of any of it. Whiskey plus money plus the inability to maintain your dignity\u2026. Well you know the rest.  That\u2019s not saying Kenny Wells is a vile person, despite his, for want of a better term, shabby look.  We\u2019re willing everything to work out for both of them, yet the American dream just becomes too much to handle.McConaughey\u2019s character compared to the regimental sharp suited Wall Street bankers is a deliberate contrast by Gaghan.  Our willingness for the sugar coated American dream to work out is pitted against the cold-hearted capitalist intentions of Brian (Corey Stoll).  Wells\u2019 resilience to counteract an offer made by Stoll and his legion of top button fastened, tight tied troubadours, can only be admired.  The ambition to fight against globalisation, to hold onto your dreams, to recapture lost determination and to let nothing stand in your way in fighting for what you want, is made believable through McConaughey\u2019s stellar performance.  However, in what should be an adventure full of undying speed to keep up with the lustful desire for success, the film\u2019s narrative is too slow to match the pace of Wells\u2019 dreams.  McConaughey is the glitter in a film without much gold."

Gold has a great performance from Matthew McCounaghey and the rest of the cast, plus interesting directing and filming. Sometimes strange in it's editing, as in weird cuts, but this was a highly entertaining film! So realistic and accurate to the real events, so crazy and suspenseful! Gold is pure Gold!"

      "text": "Reading some of the reviews on here, I've come to the conclusion many film critics' knowledge of life - or finance - only comes from watching other movies. This movie has NOTHING in common with Wolf of Wall Street or The Big Short. Maybe Treasure of the Sierra Madre?It's about mining and a notorious mining scandal. Maybe critics lost their bearings because there haven't been enough mining films?I liked the film very much. My husband loved it. It's really a 'guy movie' and as such, will appeal more to a male audience. It's also an incredibly complicated film that delves into a very convoluted story (which actually happened). So checking your emails while watching or trying to live tweet the film would be a mistake. You'll lose the plot and never catch up again.McConaughey and Ramirez work beautifully together, creating a believable bromance where two guys down on their luck join forces to \"prove 'em all wrong\". McConaughey's desperate and obnoxious huckster/prospector and Ramirez's enigmatic, elegant, legendary geologist make intriguing protagonists. And Bryce Dallas Howard brings a great, earthy charm to a woman who loves not wisely, but too well. McConaughey never tries to gain the audience's sympathy, no winks at the audience to signal \"I'm a nice guy movie star, not this jerk\" which takes a lot of brash honesty.The movie's \"punchline\" is an absolute killer and well worth the trip to get there."

      "text": "For his Oscar-winning role in \"Dallas Buyers Club\" Matthew McConaughey got sickly skinny. This time, he's thinned his hair, added a goofy tooth and grown a gut (he also spends more time in his loosey whiteys than in any of his other movies). He plays the head of a failing mining company who has a vision of gold in the jungles of Indonesia. After the initial trip, he has to contend with the business people who want to manage his findings. By his presence in almost every scene, it's obvious that McConaughey was going for another tour de force performance (dare I say Oscar \"gold\"). Unfortunately, he's trying too hard and his character is too manically obnoxious to be likable. To make matters worse, the script is bland and the direction is lackluster. While McConaughey gives it his all, the movie lacks the depth and verve to make it worth the weight he'll have to lose to get back in shape."

      "text": "A rising star in the 1990s only wind up being written off as a pretty face in the 2000s, Matthew McConaughey found the first half of the 2010s to be the kindest and most successful of his career. Starring in critical hit after critical hit, McConaughey nabbed financial success via Magic Mike and Interstellar and netted Oscar gold in Dallas Buyers Club. Toss in some of the best performances of the decade in indie darling Mud and HBO series True Detective and the early 2010s are guaranteed to go down as the most successful critical stretch of the Texan actors career. Since then, however, he has struggled. From Gus Van Sant's stinker The Sea of Trees to the mixed Free State of Jones (which, as a McConaughey apologist, I liked), McConaughey's live action worked has slumped. In fact, aside from an animated turn in Kubo and the Two Strings, he has not been in a truly good film since 2014. It may not seem like that long of a time period, but for a man who made appearances in eight critical darlings between 2011 and 2014 plus an acclaimed television series in the time period, it is a real drought considering he was in five films in 2016.One can see what drew him to Gold. Directed by Stephen Gaghan, Gold marked Gaghan's first directorial work since 2005's Syriana. For Gaghan to get up and direct again, it likely had to be one heck of a script. With the project having roots in 2011 with Michael Mann and Christian Bale sniffing around it, one cannot be blamed for being elated to see this modern day Treasure of the Sierra Madre pop up with Gaghan at the helm and McConaughey in the leading role. The end result, however, is a rather safe film that is enjoyable, often truly engaging, but always a big sloppy mess. One thing is for sure though: it is not a mess due to McConaughey, who once more fires on all cylinders. He is, however, starting to lose much of that good will built up in the \"McConaissance\". Should his next two projects, The Dark Tower and White Boy Rick, also be met with a mixed reception, who knows what the future will have in store for the man.Treasure of the Sierra Madre this is not , however, even with Gaghan snatching the themes from that film of desperation, hope, greed, and dreams of striking it rich, and tossing it into this real life tale of two men who had fooled everyone into thinking they had the biggest gold find of the 1980s. A rags to riches tale, the film feels as though it is trying to play off of recent financial scam films such as The Wolf of Wall Street or The Big Short with the film being somewhat tongue-in-cheek and often told through narration. With the narration being in the form of an FBI interview, the film hardly earns any originality points. Taking the party scenes of those aforementioned financial films, blended with a gangster-style story of a man who strikes it rich, fights with his wife and dumps her for blonde bimbos, and has uproariously insane encounters abroad and at-home, Gold is a film that has been done many times before. For this, it is rather disappointing to watch in many respects given its general stale quality and the eternal feeling that this has all been done before.Featuring a 1980s punk rock soundtrack that includes Joy Division, Iggy Pop, and Depeche Mode, Gold is a film about a moron and a genius coming together to strike it rich. The moron, Kenny Wells (Matthew McConaughey), is along for the ride. Michael Acosta (Edgar Ramirez) is a skilled con artist who, when Wells comes up to him with an offer to drill wherever, he opts to go 50-50 with the man and takes the financial world for a ride. Kenny, flush with cash and newly single from Kay (Bryce Dallas Howard), parties it up with naked blondes and has more play money than a man with his mental capacity should have. This punk rock party music accompanies these party scenes and adds this loose and casual nature to these scenes where it is easy to see that these moments are fleeting and the cash disposable. Kenny, a classic figure of a man who wishes to get rich but has no idea how to not be poor, rapidly finds himself in a position where all of the fame, fortune, and notoriety has crumbled around him. Right when he thought he was king of the world, it turned out everything he thought he knew could not have been further from reality.The film\u2019s clich\u00e9s do hold it back as previously mentioned, but they are hardly detrimental. On the surface, its story and themes are compelling even if Gaghan breaks no new ground. In fact, in its depiction of a man who is just along for the ride rather than the mastermind himself, Gold does manage to set itself apart from any number of similar biopics. Unlike other films, this one gives you a hero who is an awful businessman and constantly makes the wrong decision, ensuring that the audience will recognize he could never be the mastermind behind this scandal."

      "text": "Matthew McConaughey can be hammier than any actor around as he is in many scenes of \u201cGold\u201d but, at the same time, he can turn on a dime and touch your heart and brain as he also does in this picture. He can also turn himself into the anti romantic comedy hero which he started his career with and become a drunken, hair receding, funny middle age pot belly, looking like he needs a shave man who can still get the pretty girl. Yes he cleans up very good, but it really is hard to cover up the loose, dirty-whiteys, mainly wet, he shows in a few scenes, under a tux.Though McConaughey is the center of the film many scenes are quietly stolen from him by Edgar Ramirez, who plays his partner in discovering a mountain of gold and they develop a believable bromance while wheeling and dealing the men in suits and on Wall Street. Another scene stealer is Bryce Dallas Howard as McConaughey\u2019s long time girlfriend who believes in, and puts up with, him.Based on a true story it tells of a dreamer whose dreams come true making him a very wealthy man but, as always is the case, has the same problems he had when he was poor. Like most dreamers it is the thrill of the chase and when you catch up with a dream and see it burst in front of you it is hard to know how to react.While Matthew McConaughey, Edgar Ramirez and the cast do their best, and it is good, the writers of the screenplay, Patrick Massett and John Zinman, don\u2019t quite deliver.Director Stephen Gaghan handles the business scenes and the lushness of and in the Indonesian valleys but doesn\u2019t quite connect with the performers in the Nevada scenes nor does he reign in when McConaughney gets too hammy.\u201cGold\u201d is an interesting enough movie that I want to read the true story but not good enough for me to recommend."

It was a pretty good story, with very good actors, and was decently directed and kept me interested.

      "text": "Prospector and geologist desperate for a lucky break (Matthew McConaughey, Edgar Ram\u00edrez) try to find gold in the uncharted jungle of Indonesia. They find what they were looking for but keeping the gold may be even more difficult than finding it.Based on a true event from the 1990's. Also appearing: Bryce Dallas Howard, Corey Stoll, Craig T. Nelson et al.Do you remember the times when Matthew McConaughey used to have ripped body, look like million dollars and star in mainstream movies?The current decade has brought us a new kind of McConaughey. He prefers to look like **** doesn't care much about mainstream, and has sworn allegiance to method acting, or whatever it's called these days.In short, the man doesn't do roles anymore, he becomes who he's supposed to play. And luckily for movie buffs, he picks projects that really have something to say.McConaughey was always a good enough actor but the new him is something of a revelation. He brings this fresh kind of \u2013 for want of a more suitable term \u2013 in-your-face style where every detail and nuance of the performance has been made to count, cameras often close-up.Only a few movies are using this approach \u2013 psychologically, it probably asks much from both thespian and director working with him. But McConaughey has absolutely nailed this brave method, best witnessed in \"Interstellar\", first season of HBO's \"True Detective\", and now \"Gold\".I don't always consider the appearances of a character an essential part of the performance, especially if the movie is not related to sci-fi, but this time is an exception. This is the role remembered by both powerful acting style described above and how the character looks like.The man looks even more deliciously disgusting than usual, sporting pot-belly (result of gaining 20 kilos for the role), false teeth (making him look a bit like working class Austin Powers from 1990's USA) and skullet. And all this only enhances his usual energetic in-your-face performance.A word about skullet. This amazing hairstyle is, by my definition, the second worst crime a male person can commit against his appearance. Google it or something.It's basically a bald head WITH mullet and in real life it would be reason enough to make many people stay away, I imagine. McConaughey does not shy away from it and it becomes another reason you will remember \"Gold\" for.This is director Stephen Gaghan's first movie since 2005's intelligent but raher boring \"Syriana\". And the comeback is noteworthy indeed.Thus far, I haven't written much about movie as a whole, for two reasons. First and foremost, although the cast is big and good, it is McConaughey's show. If you happen to not care about him, there's little motivation to watch.The main possible exception is Bryce Dallas Howard as leading character's wife, in a kind and warm role the Supporting Actress Oscars are perfect for. Except she didn't get nominated. But it perfectly compensates the manic energy of the main man.Secondly, it's basically another of those countless \"greed makes good\" American stories which are inspired by and copy the basics of 1987's seminal classic \"Wall Street\". You know, the rise and fall of a underdog who never gave up.Although they make the same old tired story function nicely, one can't really call it inspiring or fresh again. I felt the same about \"Wolf of Wall Street\", by the way. The less you have seen this type of stuff, the higher you'd score \"Gold\".Somehow the project hasn't gotten recognition during current awards season, having only won Hollywood Film Award for the ensemble of the year and gotten nominated for the Golden Globe for the best song.The critics at RottenTomatoes and Metacritic doesn't give it a warm welcome either. Let me disagree on this one. \"Gold\" is not original but perfectly decent watch anyway."

      "text": "Treasure hunt meets the wall street!Loosely based on the real. It's both a treasure hunt film, and a wall street tale. The great mix of two made it a fine film. Wall street based films always fascinates the grown-ups. So do this film. Matthew McConaughey playing in one of two main role, I thought it should have been called 'Fool's Gold 2'. You will know why I said that once you watch it, or maybe you know it already. But the end twist was something different, changed everything.The man who inherited the family business of mining, is now in the crisis of losing everything. His final move is to join the hand with another man struggling as same as he is. They both pull off successfully the initial hiccup. And after a long struggle, seems they had hit a bullseye. The lives have changed forever or is it! Another trouble follows them, following, the story reaches the end with a twist.At first, I thought it was like in the line of 'There Will Be Blood'. As the narration progresses, the gear changed between the two worlds. One being in the US and then in Indonesian Jungle. I thought the end should have been little more detail, but it still worked fine.An underrated film for sure. If it was a DiCaprio film, it would have been highly praised.Actually, I liked it. Well written screenplay and performances. Matthew McConaughey was awesome. We talk about actor like Johnny Depp for playing roles in awesome costumes, but this guy turned the roles to reality. It's either 'Dallas Buyer's Club' or this or any others. He deserves well respect more the big names right now. Thousand times better than accidental actor, DiCaprio.Edgar Ramirez was also good. Bryce Dallas Howard had an important role as well. Overall, This is one of the films not to miss from the 2016 calender. It could have been a box office bomb, but definitely will be recognised as the time pass by. I would surely suggest it to anybody.8/10"
