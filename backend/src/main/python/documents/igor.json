      "text": "Not suitable for children, or really anyone for that matter. With good voice talent, competent animation and a pre-halloween season to play within, this 1.5 hour tour has much going for it, but like Frankenstein's monster, it turns out to be over-sized mess that scares children and horrifies adults. Having received free passes to see it a week in advance, I don't like to be unkind, but having made the mistake of taken young children (ages 2.5 and 4.5) to the movie, I'd like to take this early opportunity to dissuade others from doing the same. But if you like to expose your youth to slapstick without the funny, countless suicide jokes and lowbrow dialogue ranging from name-calling to hate-speech, then who am I to stop you. Those drawn by the voice talents of John Cleese (playing here a mad scientist reminiscent of the schoolteacher from the cover art of Pink Floyd's the Wall) will be gravely disappointed, as Mr. Cleese evidently had the good sense to leave the movie after the first 10 minutes. If only I had been wise enough to do the same."

      "text": "In the tradition of Valerie Martin's 1990 Nebula-award-winning novel \"Mary Reilly\"(later adapted to the screen by Stephen Frears), an igor, like the nameless servant in Robert Louis Stevenson's \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\", gets to be the protagonist of his own narrative, stepping out, at long last, from being stereotyped, a stock character usually in possession of a low I.Q., who was first seen in James Whale's original \"Frankenstein\"(there is no mention of Igor in the 1817 Mary Shelley novella). The mad scientist, even in Mel Brooks' parodic \"Young Frankenstein\", is portrayed as the smartest man in the castle; but \"Igor\", in the film's most clever conceit, reimagines these mental giants as idiots(Dr. Glickenstein, voiced by John Cleese) and plagiarists(Dr. Schadenfreude, voiced by Eddie Izzard). This igor is like the Will Hunting of igors; he may possess a hump, but he's \"wicked smaht\", stuck in a malevolent world of chowderheads. Being that there are no igors of the fairer sex, and since he's straight, when Igor(John Cusack) plays God, he creates woman. He creates Kirstie Alley, but this former lab-assistant calls her Eva(Molly Shannon). His monster is an actress; a not-so-inside joke about how all female thespians have the potential to be divas. While \"Igor\" works as an old-school Hollywood picture about the entertainment biz, like most 3D-animated films not made by Pixar, however, the filmic elements are too post-modernist by half; in other words, too many pop culture references spoil the soup. When the showtunes kick in, it's like watching Tim Burton's take on \"Moulin Rouge\". But give \"Igor\" some credit for being insightful about how popular film, historically, and to this day, has a tendency to misrepresent people of all persuasions, in particular, this class of igors. Igor doesn't walk, or talk, the way he's supposed to; the way we're pre-conditioned to accept his kind, as servants, as people on the margins. See what the film is getting at?"

      "text": "I LOVED this movie!! I was lucky enough to be invited to a sneak preview and went with less than great expectations, and was blown away. There are too many 'lairs' to talk about to give the film full credit, but I will say that after seeing this film, I want to see it again to catch the jokes I missed when the audience was laughing. And the political sidenotes did not go unnoticed. There was a tough of George Bush in King Malbert, who looks like a cockroach. But more than that, the movie shows a take on good vs. evil in a different light. Sometimes, you need something created out of the ether to show you whats wrong with the world, and Igor discovers those ills via Eva, played by Molly Shannon, who helps in exposing the truth behind malaria and who is in charge. I recommend this movie!!!"

That rat rabbit got on my nerves with his comments and voice over. (good actor, but maybe not suited for animation voice overs). And the leading lady... the monster was obnoxious as well on the order of an American Idol reject. Sorry, too many good animated films out there for this Tim Burton knock-off to deserve a 7 or higher."
