      "text": "Chaos Walking is hampered by extremely erratic writing, poor editing, and an overly complicated plot that the director was unable to weave into cohesion. Daisy Ridley and Mads Mikkelson try desperately to pull this movie out of a deeply convoluted canyon of contrived and pretentious takes on sci-fi tropes, but weren't able to lift the finished product up from being bland and cringey. Tom Holland falls flat yet again, delivering another complete dud of a performance, after being nearly unwatchable in Cherry, which also came out recently. Tom should really stick to Spider-Man, and leave the serious acting to people who have range. The plot of Chaos Walking is so poorly executed that it doesn't even seem believable by any human standard. The actions taken by the tribe of men Holland's character belongs to are completely devoid of logic and practicality, serving only to demonize and ostracize themselves with no real benefit. After that, the film tries to pay off on story beats based on the plight of the male characters, that their thoughts are projected for all to see, but this idea is crippled by Tom Holland's abysmal performance. Don't watch this movie. It's an embarrassing mess."

I think we have a problem where something is successful so we automatically have to adapt it into a film or tv show. We can't just admit that just because it is successful in one form, it won't be as successful in another. Read books, Ignore this awful film."

The Noise gimmick serves as a fairly effective comedic tool as Todd proves awkward around Viola. Other than that, it is nothing but a constant nuisance that made this clich\u00e9-loaded Sci-fi actioner an unbearable watch. Tom Holland deserves so much better.(3.5/10)"

      "text": "(Mauro Lanari)It is true that the Young Adult dystopia has been an established formula for a decade now, with a teenage couple bound by an ambiguous and often conflicted relationship but still united in resisting the social system and ready to fight against the established power. Equally true that these stories represent a way to overturn unlikely youthful eversions into safe consumerist evasions. It is also true that this film has a meaningless script, contains a brutal anti-animalist scene, threatens one or two sequels and was a box office flop. Yet Tom Holland's candor and his being such a credible \"sui generis\" hero in his clumsiness and vulnerability gets the miracle of making the aforementioned flaws forget for wide moments."

      "text": "With book to big screen adaptations there are always elements from the source material that will be changed to suit the screen or be edited out. In the case of this adaptation of the best-selling book series by novelist Patrick Ness everything gripping was inherently missing.The ideas were there, and so much could have been done with it, who wouldn't want to watch a movie about men's inability to hide their thoughts. So much could be deeply explored; from the questionable thoughts which dart in and out of a person's mind with no meaning, to heartbreak or the relatively comical.Unfortunately, what was delivered were mere touches of these possibly engaging plots points almost to the point you would assume any exploration was taboo and forbidden.I kept watching in the hopes the dribs and drabs of 'what could have been' would manifest eventually. But, alas, boredom set in and the entire movie melded into one long thought of \"Is anything good actually going to happen?\".This is disappointing considering the level of, both young and seasoned, talent in the film. But a great performance from Mads Mikkelsen, as the story's antagonist, couldn't save me from the poor script writing being a repetition of short lines; most of which are the main protagonist reciting his own name over and over into oblivion. Or enough to overlook the repeated references to an \"aggressive\" alien species native to the planet, which in actuality is only shown once in a brief scene and never seen or referenced again.Coupled with the lack of engagement from Tom Holland and Daisy Ridley who, despite being talented in their own rights, had next to no chemistry at all and who's possibility of any love interest forming, despite the script hinting at the possibility of moving towards it, was more akin to someone finding and feeling sorry for an injured puppy. Or, more accurately, someone getting bluntly friend-zoned repeatedly which continuing to make frequent subtle hints at interest throughout.There is certainly some merit to be had. But, for me, where it failed and what was lacking was too obvious to overlook for me to find the film enjoyable."

The alien world is entirely unexplored. The mysteries around the noise and the aliens compelled us through two acts. There is no payoff on these. It's a classic Chekhov's gun and it never goes off.3. We get no closure on what happens to the people of Farbranch. The ending is so abrupt that there's hardly time for a single goodbye. Fade to black. These characters don't matter to the writers or director. They certainly shouldn't matter to us.This is student filmmaking. Skip it."

      "text": "I am writing this review because I was deeply disappointed by the way the critics had underrated this movie. 'Chaos walking' may not be a perfectly made movie as we knew how this movie's works had been going on but still it's a must watch. The concept of 'Noise' (where one can express his inner thoughts as a projection to others) is something new to the movie world and this concept is well crafted in this movie despite the flaws in it's storyline. The story takes place in fantasy world named \"The New World\" (which is of course not earth) where a woman named Viola(Daisy Ridley) crash lands due to a malfunction in their spaceship killing all the other crew members. She soon learns the truth that she was in a planet where all the women had been killed by the men. But a man named Todd(Tom Holland) agrees to help her escape \"The New World\" and also from the evil Mayor Prentiss(Mads Mikkelsen) [a war hero and the leader of Prentisstown who spreads the message to kill all the women because they do not have The Noise in them]. This film may be a slow fantasy survival thriller which lefts many questions unanswered (like for a sequel) but the top notch visuals and beautiful soundtracks and outstanding acting outweighs them all. Maybe due to the pandemic this film failed to make it to the box office,an hybrid release would have been better. I know most of you who read this review have not seen this movie but please ignore the critics and watch it at least once even though you may feel this film is a bit slow(not for me) the concept of The Noise would never leave your mind and that will make you feel how much this movie had been underrated. This movie is a very great weekend journey which will surely make an impact if you don't get your hopes so high and watch it simply as a movie."

I do agree with some of the critiques about the lack of confrontation this movie chooses and how strange that is given its hard driving plot that is the power of \"thoughts on full display.\" I have my own complaints about the climax of the film, but in the end  neither of these things bothed me. The movie really drew me in and I was totally blown away by the subtle acting that had to be done to make all of the thought outbursts feel real to me and not like an afterthought done in effects. I really liked the tone of the movie and how it didn't feel like anything I've seen in a while. I have to say that I didn't entirely see where this was going at all times and that was really nice. For the most part this is an on the slow side popcorn action flick, but if you are into sci-fi this is a solid entry that has left me intrigued enough to want to watch it again."

Considering director Doug Liman is known for action films, this trek has its share of encounters, some of which are mildly exciting.

Chaos Walking literally describes his style ironically, but its actual result is nothing but. It is a surprisingly well acted, sci fi Young Adult film, starring two of the most \"in\" young actors of its time i.e. Tom Holland and Daisy Ridley, along with a surprisingly strong supporting cast. It also has a very unique concept behind it that intrigues.  Again, I mention this analogy time and time again, if released on a streaming platform, I believe critics will be more receptive of it."

It's not like you know, SO:2001, interstellar, Ridley Scott's Alien, yeah cool, but those are the greats, the movies that set trends for decades. It is stupid a little I think to hold all movies to that standard. Even Shakespeare had some downright stupid plays. Sometimes you just want some popcorn munching fun, which this movie totally is! Pretty sure the problem here is that critics get recognition and thereby more money, basically in proportion the more they shoot things down, the more savagely they rip apart someone's art.  Anyway, I'm straying from the review a little, so; Chaos Walking is pretty sweet, pretty straightforward sci fi. Surprisingly I DIDN'T find it to be overly indulgent in  teen / YA style tropes. The core setting is really interesting, the CGI is great, the writing and acting is great. Honestly ya'll, F**k the haters. Amiright?"

The truly childlike innocence he brings to his characters is beautiful and deeply touching. It is no doubt he is the best part of Chaos Walking. It is an absolutely fun movie with a delightfully simple, yet uncommon premise that puts its cast in awkward situations, while entertaining the audience; causing us to pause, question, think and laugh. However, with a hugely talented and experienced cast, you would expect their talent to shine through but unfortunately, the movie does not give its supporting cast room to shine. In fact we only get to see them in passing and there's a whole lot more detail in the movie that's sadly left unexplored. By end of the movie, Chaos Walking musters a lot of excitement that leaves you wanting more of the movie and more of its story besides its straightforward plot. All in all, it offers a wholesome & interesting take on its reality and - the chaos walking."

      "text": "Adapting a series of books into a movie is often a daunting task. As anyone who has seen many Stephen King adaptations can attest; plot complexity, characters, and depth are removed in order to condense the story into a two-hour or less run time.The rise of streaming services has allowed many books to be adapted into series without having to cut much of the adult content in the books which would make it difficult for network television.As such it makes adaptations such as \u201cChaos Walking\u201d a delicate undertaking. The film is based on a series of books and stars Tom Holland as Todd; a young ma living on a distant world where there are no women and people can hear and see each other\u2019s thoughts by a process known as \u201cNoise\u201d.Their rustic colony is run with a firm hand by their Mayor (Mads Mikkelsen); who keeps those around him from seeing his thoughts which gives him a big advantage over those who rule.When a landing craft from a mothership filled with a new wave of colonists crashes on the planet; Todd is shocked to find that the only survivor is a woman named Viola (Daisy Ridley) whose arrival disrupts the community.The Mayor wishes to keep her from contacting her ship so they can seize it when it lands to maintain control of his empire as he sees the arrival of new individuals as a threat to his power.Todd and Viola escape trying to reach a distant colony where she hopes to find a way to warn her ship about the danger the Mayor and his men present and they pursue the duo to keep this from happening.The film lightly touches on the native race that Todd believes killed all the women of their colony but they are not visited save for a brief appearance. It is clear that the Mayor is hiding something and the reveal of what and why is fairly underwhelming which reduces him and most of his followers as thinly developed stock characters.There is also the mystery as to why the Mothership does not bother to do any sort of follow up when they did not hear from their lander and like many aspects of the film; require the audience to simply go along with things and not ask too many questions to make things work.Thankfully the two leads are interesting enough and they hold attention even when the story is slowly moving along with scene after scene of rivers, woods, and a little conversation.One big issue with the film is the Noise as the visualization of thoughts as well as hearing them mixed in with verbal communication can get very confusing as it is like multiple voices in a crowded room.Despite the issues, the potential is there and I found myself wondering what was next for the characters and hope that they do adapt future books in the series.  While the film on its own does not work as a fully developed story\u2019 as an introduction to the series it does enough to peak the interests for more.3.5 out of 5Skewed and Reviewed"

The film stars  Daisey Ridley (Rey of recent Star Wars franchise fame), and Mads Mikkelsen in a juicy bad guy role. The entire film seems to be a grand \u2018ole trek into an alien planet that oddly seems to resemble the forests of the American Northwest (before all the forest fires devoured the landscape). This alien planet is populated by settles, cowboys and aliens (well, it\u2019s actually one alien and the spectator is briefly treated to a glimpse of an alien village in the distance for a few seconds) who are battling it out for existence on this Earth like planet. The film is beautiful to watch and the acting is superb, but it falls short in the category of plot and story. It is not quite clear or logical why these settles are so dead set against each other. The planet seems to have an otherworldly affect on humans in that it changes males so that their thoughts are constantly floating around their heads and open to interpretation by anyone who is within close vicinity; but for some unexplainable reason, females are not affected by the planetary phenomenon. And for some further strange reason, this phenomenon is what caused the males of one community to murder all the females. This feel that one has to read the book in order to properly understand the plot of this film. Overall great acting by Ridley and the other actors and the film is well paced and flows smoothly, apart from the confusing story line."

While he looks like he exists for no other reason than to play Spiderman, his transition into actual roles is doomed for failure. The kid tries but hes not really that good of an actor. Its also hard to take seriously with the baby face. Even if he is determined to make it long term the best he could hope for is the DiCaprio curse. Decades of being passed over and not taken seriously for how he looks. DiCaprio had the acting chops to brute force his way to an Oscar. Tom Holland never will. His best hope is to ride his spiderman fame to a few middling roles like this one, bank up enough money to live off of, maybe do a few tv series along the way before ultimately fading out of memory.....but I digress. As for this film Holland is mostly a color by numbers warm body to fill the role.A similar problem comes from his mouseketter counterpart in the form of Ridley. She has no acting skill. This film really highlights how she is like the second coming of Kristen Stewart but her schtick is smiling. Her range runs from Shouting to glaring to \"I smile, I cute\".Mads is the highlight of the film and ultimately his talent is squandered on a moustache twirling basic villain. Now if that were the whole criteria the flick would generate maybe as high as a 7.5. It is mechanically put together well. The sound work is solid, the visuals are vibrant. Choreographed scenes like those with animals are a particular strong point for the film. All in all it would be a passable summer popcorn muncher type film.The nosedive comes from the absolutely toxic and sexist premise of the film. The short of it amounts to \"men are bad, Just see how bad they are when women can hear their REAL thoughts.\" This is absolute paranoid sexist feminist claptrap. The unfounded fears that every man is just a violent animal that either wants to hurt them, subjugate them or turn them into their personal broodmare. The actors are not really at fault for their performances as they are delivering the lines written. The fault comes from the sexists who wrote this pandering to toxic feminist ideology. It promotes the paranoid delusional false narrative women are increasingly developing that makes them look at men as either their ultimate threat lurking around every corner, or they are useless, emasculated men that are too bumbling to be useful for anything. This garbage HAS to stop.Dont get me wrong, they do a good job packaging this hateful message into a palatable meal. The overall production is not bad at all. You however cannot remove the quality of this film from the propaganda it is built around. That eats off 4 points in my book and tbh it SHOULD remove 6, but again the overall production is solid. 3/10 Incredibly begrudgingly"

The way they justify all the women killing is just bad.They had a possibility with the priest's religion but they focused on a dubious villain that has blurry motivations instead. You have aliens on the planet but they are not exploited correctly. They are an accessory. Why a ship with 4000 peoples take so much time to investigate their scout ship crash, is beyond me! You had good concepts like the noise, the religion and it would have been fun to see the alien relation to the noise. Still the movie had good acting, some action and great visuals. I give it 62%. An ok movie that missed a lot of opportunities."

To be honest, it took me most of the movie to get the hang of hearing the words and picking out the images in the \"chaos\".  And even then, I missed much of it.  I have some hearing loss and extremely loud tinnitus."

Unfortunately the crescendo ending the film was building towards fizzled out. Strong characters became weak, In the age of magic, space ships and lasers swinging a small stick (it was tiny) was enough to scare the big bad into falling backwards to his death."

The settings are lovely. Apparently, the movie doesn't follow the novels at all. The entire project lacked depth. The strength of the casting decisions and performance will account for the majority of my assessment."
