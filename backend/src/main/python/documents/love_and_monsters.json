The main character here is just written so brick stupid he becomes un-relatable. I guess that's intentional, part of the charm. I just didn't buy into it. It's the type of movie that under a few different writers, a different director and maybe different casting could have been a real jem. Instead it's a token b movie."

      "text": "It's always a real treat when a film from which one might not expect much turns out to be a pleasant surprise, and so it is with this charming, fun, entertaining sci-fi/teen romance/comedy/road trip tale set against the challenges of a crushing but comical monsterpocalypse. When a global catastrophe causes animals, insects and other forms of wildlife to mutate into monsters, surviving humans are forced into underground bunkers to stay alive. But that becomes tiresome over time, as a bored, geeky, lonesome twenty-something discovers out when separated from his girlfriend for years, prompting him to take a chance and go in search of her, despite the perils. What ensues is an evolutionary saga that's reflected in more than just the creatures of nature. Though occasionally somewhat predictable, the film is nevertheless filled with many delightful plot twists and developments that are augmented by colorful supporting characters (some of them human, some not), genuinely laugh-out-loud humor and even a few touching moments that are truly heartfelt but without ever becoming sappy. Then there are the picture's superb visual effects, which very deservedly earned an Oscar nomination for their clever, inventive, eye-popping designs. While \"Love and Monsters\" may not have a particularly compelling title, it has much to offer in terms entertainment value and engaging insights, even for younger viewers, qualities that are often hard to come by in fare aimed at such audiences. And, even though this one has been quietly flying below the radar for a while, director Michael Matthews' second feature outing deserves wider attention than it has been getting in light of everything it has going for it."

Whether it's depression, anxiety, or addiction, many of us have had to watch someone we care about ruin or waste their own lives because of a cycle they can't break.Joel feels unloved and unlovable. He was experiencing one of the happiest and most hopeful moments when his world literally ended. In his mind, his failure to bond with and pair off with anyone in his bunker is evidence of his lack of value. Honestly, he's a bit like an incel in his thinking. He immediately projects any potential future happiness on a few brief conversations with his newly found, but long hunted-for girlfriend, Aimee. Setting off without proper preparations, he needs immediate rescuing by Boy, a dog who is so desperately lonely for company that he follows Joel, dragging his own sad baggage with him. Meeting Clyde and Minnow, two other survivors who bear the scars of their own losses behind masks with varying degrees of fragility. Joel learns some skills for coping with his anxiety which is necessary because he ends up being the one who has to save Boy after he separated from Minnow and Clyde. He saves himself and Boy again but has a falling out with his friend due to his friend's own weakness nearly costing them everything.When he does meet up with the object of his projected love, he is very surprised that she's got better things to do than validate his newfound skill at just dealing with the stuff she's been dealing with for years. Unlike him, she spent her time moving forward while he remained stuck in the worst moment of his life.Joel struggles with disbelief and self-doubt as he examines his reason for this quest, but a quick reminder that there's no place like home opens his eye to the idea that he could actually take an active role in making other people's lives better.Like many people who are unaware of how they're really seen by others, he responds to the world around him by drawing a fictional version of it, and experiences it like he believes he's the protagonist of an epic adventure. Joel eventually lets go of the narrative of a world that revolves around him, and realizes that there are other people who have their own problems in the world, and that he might be able to help them. His discovery comes right before the most meta moment in an already self-aware monster movie. Joel realizes that the plot of every other post-apocalyptic movie has been transplanted into his movie. He seems disgusted by the cliche far more than the actions of the villains, which perfectly suits the tone of the movie, but could have easily fallen flat with a 'Good till the last twenty minutes when they tried to shove in some more action'. I think one of the gifts of this movie was its casting. With the exception of Joel and perhaps Boy, most of the other characters have limited screen time, but they manage to pack a lot into every moment. A lingering look of pain when Joel is given a goodbye hug from a bunker-mate who recently lost someone only to have a much later flashback showing the movie's first casualty, along with other bunker-mates dragging a nearly catatonic Joel to safety when he is paralyzed by fear and disbelief. Minnow and Clyde carry their loneliness and losses with them and their pain behind masks of varying degrees of fragility.Jessica Henwick is a treat as we see her in flashbacks and the present as a firmly anchored and tough but sweet and kind young woman who becomes a leader on her own due to the fact that she had to.O'Brien wears the screen naturally and excels in this kind of role where his goofy charm, much like in Weird City, is relatable to many people who are just regular guys in an irregular world.I'm not really hoping for a full-length sequel, because I think it said what needed to be said. I can see where people refer to this story line as derivative, but I thought it was far more original then the dozen or so revamps of Batman/Spiderman/Superman etc."

Dylan O'Brien plays one guy who decides to venture onto the surface so he can reconnect with his past girlfriend. This leads him on an adventure where he encounters several big creatures and learns his own strengths. There\u2019s a light-hearted approach to the narrative that doesn\u2019t approach funny, but keeps the attitude crisp. O\u2019Brien does a nice job of playing humorously inept, which is good since he\u2019s on camera the entire movie. The monsters are fun, but other than their design, there\u2019s little original. This latest take on the genre is pleasant enough to watch, but offers little new and certainly nothing frightening."

Thanks to a fun lead performance by Dylan O\u2019Brien, a fast paced script and some great monster effects it is still a pretty entertaining movie in its own right however, and it serves to prove that it is still possible to make these sort of films on a relatively modest budget."

      "text": "\"Love and Monsters\" starts off as a teen romance interrupted by the apocalypse, but thankfully becomes much more than that and ultimately very entertaining. There is a welcome trend recently in apocalyptic movies (possibly due to the ongoing pandemic) of finding originality vs. defaulting to a zombie plague. Former \"Teen Wolf\" and \"The Maze Runner\" star Dylan O'Brien is an affably geeky guy that stumbles into the hero role. The monster scenes balance decent special effects with fun action. I would have liked to see more of the beginning's \"life in the bunker\" setup as it would likely have given the movie more emotional depth.

But it's ok, it's not like it's wrapped up in a stupid way.

Scenery, cinematography, and CGI are well done. I thought some of the \"monsters\" were a little corny but it did get nominated for an Oscar in Visual Effects and Best Sci-fi/Fantasy for Critics Choice. The basic story line wasn't anything new but there was some creativity along the way, and the ending was satisfying, but also left the possibility for a sequel. There are definite plot holes, silly scenes, and obviously requires a willing suspension of disbelief... I mean it's sci-fi, where bugs become ginormous in 7 years LOL!

      "text": "Love and Monsters is a movie where I just watched it because it had \"Monsters\" in the title. I love monster movies and since new movies coming out are rare, I gave it a watch. The premise is simple \"Seven years after the Monsterpocalypse, Joel Dawson (Dylan O'Brien), along with the rest of humanity, has been living underground ever since giant creatures took control of the land. After reconnecting over the radio with his high school girlfriend, Aimee, who is now 80 miles away at a coastal colony, Joel begins to fall for her again. As Joel realizes that there's nothing left for him underground, he decides to venture out to Aimee, despite all the dangerous monsters that stand in his way\". So was this movie a \"monster\" good time or a large-bore?Firstly, the characters are all great. Joel Dawson (Dylan O'Brien) is a very frightened and nervous individual but gradually grows more confident as the movie progress which is done convincingly. Later on, in the movie Joel meets two survivors on the surface, Clyde (Michael Rooker) and Minnow (Ariana Greenblatt), who eventually teach Joel the ropes on surviving. Clyde is the cool teacher and Minnow is the very loveable sidekick. The best addition to this movie is the pet dog \"Boy\" who goes with our main character Joel on his journey. \"Boy\" adds an extra layer to this movie by giving Joel, and the audience, someone to care about on the journey and leads to some intense moments. The director, Michael Matthews, made a great choice in including a companion for Joel as the movie wouldn't have hit the same notes if it was just him. Also, dog companions are great anyway. There are some other characters like Aimee (Jessica Henwick), Joel's goal, and they are all pretty good as well.I do have to give a lot of praise to Dylan O'Brien as he is very charming and charismatic despite playing a kind of nerdy loser type character. He makes Joel seem very relatable and successfully makes us root for him. There are also some surprisingly emotional moments sprinkled in this movie and Dylan's performance is very good, to say the least in making us feel for him. There also some comedic moments and quips from our main character that for the most part land and none of it takes us out from the emotional core of the movie.Let's talk about the monsters, they are great. They all have freaky designs but still, look reminiscent of the animals that they mutated from. The movie only has a few monster moments that appear but it works. Every moment where a monster appears is intense and suspenseful. There is also a great world-building and rules set in the movie that I particularly enjoyed. Not all monsters are the same as each monster have different ways to be dealt with and some monsters who are not as aggressive which was interesting. If I had to give a flaw to the movie then it has to be the predictability and the cliches in the movie. The story isn't anything amazing and you can probably guess all the twist in this movie since it uses so many cliches that you would expect. Right from the first 10 minutes of the movie you can probably guess one of the twists near the end since it feels that incredibly cliche. The third act of this movie is not as good as the first two acts which were focused on the loneliness and struggle of our main character. The last act feels like a completely different movie with its over the top nature that is mostly dumb action rather than intense or suspenseful like the previous action set pieces. Overall, Love and Monster don't do much new but that's okay. In the end, the movie knows what it wants to be which is the growth of Joel on his journey with some monsters and it does that good. The movie has a lot of heart and sincerity that isn't in a lot of movies nowadays. The movie is carried by a great performance from Dylan O'Brien and I hope to see more of him in the future. I had a surprisingly good time with this movie and I believe you will as well."

To me, this is the equivalent of an airplane book you nab before taking a long flight or a broken-spine paperback you pick up at a garage sale on a Saturday morning. The world we know and love is gone and is currently filled with monsters or so you find out on the back cover and Hero-guy is on a journey. Yep, a journey. Don't worry, despite the 'originality' he is likeable and offers commentary and expositional asides as he goes on his typical hero's journey. His want: to join up with the love of his former, pre-apocalyptic life (he's getting tired of listening to his good friends boink in their underground bunkers). His need: to become brave and more confident. His friends pshaw him...cue \"you won't survive without us\" chorus but oh, au contraire... on the surface of monster-land, he first befriends a dog that is a perfect prototype of man's best friend (care of the screenwriter): reliable, intelligent, sentimental and all around good soul. Next he meets a quasi father-daughter team who teach him a thing or two about the landscape and what to look out for. So, here he gets lessons in survival skills. Then a robot who keeps him company (don't worry, no post-apocalyptic, digital hanky-panky) and he has his share of growing pains via valiant battles then lo and behold, he meets his love who turns out not to be so much in love with him anymore. She's kind of moved on, bro. But yeah, there is a villain with an Australian accent who at first seems legit (he brews his own beer) but he is too good to be true for Mr. Hero. Turns out, lame, he only wants his giant crab to have food (i.e. people) so said crab will have energy to get him to take the next group of survivors he and his crew can hoodwink. Hero escapes and learns/realizes during battle that the crab is under the dominion of bad Aussie man and blasts the poor crustacean free. Next thing, crab has the revenge vibe and villain and henchmen are gobbled up good and the end is: well, Hero is respected and maybe, he will get 'some' later. But now, time to get people out of bunkers, back on the surface and into the mountains where the monsters don't go. Boom. Book cover closed. The end. Toss it.    Fun and forgettable which is sadly a Netflix norm. But hey, a pizza movie that is light and for a Friday night, why not? Why not, indeed."

It is also not predictable as you think, you are gonna be surprised especially in the last half hour ,it will go in a different direction in a very good way. Also it does carry a message and it is not just a pointless fun movie. It is suitable for kids and for family watch, it will be really good if you watch with your family in this quarantine, it will cheer you up and it is really suitable for this time in a good way , give it a shot and you won't regret it.  Besides, who doesn't enjoy watching a movie with Dylan O'Brien in it"

I was a little skeptical of the movie concept and thought it would be a little childish considering the title of the film but it manages to entertain without being too corny or cheesy. It\u2019s just the right amount of light-hearted without being too breezy and I laughed through almost the entire thing. The protagonist, Joel Dawson, potrayed by Dylan O\u2019Brien, is so easy to love and relate to you root for him until the very end.I was very excited to watch another Dylan project and this was worth every second. Check this movie out if you want a good laugh with moments of peculiar depth. You won\u2019t regret it. I certainly don\u2019t."
