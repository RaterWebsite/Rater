      "text": "Basically a violent revenge story with a plot that feels a bit like a video game. Clocking in under 90 minutes (excluding credits), the movie never really digs into any of the characters' pasts or gives any indication of their future hopes or goals, and the line between good guys and bad guys is very black and white. If you're looking for a lot of character development or intriguing twists, you won't find them here. At the same time, the straight-forward story is relatively free of plot-holes and pointless scenes.\r What little we do know about the characters is engaging. The bad guys are appropriately despicable, and you root for them to get their comeuppance. The few good guys aren't exactly angels either, but they are likeable. Mads Mikkelsen is well-cast as the main protagonist. He has a good look for Westerns, and he is believable both as a blue-collar family man and as a steely gunfighter.\r One aspect of the movie that stood out was that--unlike most westerns or Hollywood shoot-em-ups in general--villains didn't always go down with a single shot. Even nondescript henchmen might take a shot to the leg or abdomen and keep fighting, as opposed to the old plummet-off-the-roof routine seen in so many westerns. This added to the grittiness and authenticity of action scenes."

Based on some of the reviews I had read I was concerned the opening scenes might be too much, but I was pleasantly relieved that much of what could have been shown on the screen actually wasn't.  Other reviews said there were no captions for the few Danish lines in the movie, but there were English captions in our local theater. An overall very engaging Western."

      "text": "A beautiful, if brutal revenge western, that brings real style and class to the genre. The screenplay and story are full of surprises and tension and one begins to expect the unexpected. Following on from his excellent performances in films like \u2018The Hunt and \u2018A Royal affair\u2019, as well as his TV outing in \u2018Hannibal, Mads Mikkelesen proves once again that he is a commanding presence on screen and an actor one looks forward to watching. High production values across the board and a stunning South African location also make the film both aurally and aesthetically pleasing. However, it must be said that the cinematography is the star of the show. With its vibrant use of colour and the almost surreal beauty of its night time shots the film belies a probable small budget and looks better than most blockbusters ever could. This is a real gem that will reward those who seek out its treasure. Small, maybe, but perfectly formed."

      "text": "Revenge for a revenge.\r It is a Danish western revenge flick set in the American soil, so 99 per cent it was in the English language. Well, in my opinion, it is underrated for sure. It was not anything stylish like QT's recent western films, but quite usual presentation yet very majestic. The story takes place in a couple of days in a small town in the 1871. The turnaround in the theme was great. Initially, it leaves an impression of a revenge based tale, but later becomes oil warfare, something quite resembles the original situation of the American at that time.\r In the last few weeks I have been watching lots of comedies, dramas and other soft themed films, so suddenly I felt too much violence from this. But as always I get used to it after some time in the watch. Great cast and their great performances. The writing was superb along with the settings. I watched it quite late, but the best western I have seen in the recent time, so I strongly recommended for western fans and others who're seeking a fine entertainment.\r 7.5/10"

      "text": "At first I thought this will be the usual western movie where somebody is attacking the town and some hero guy decides to help them and save them. In a sense it still were like that, but it had a twist on it - the town did not ask the main guy to help them, he was against the bad characters mostly because of revenge and because they killed his kin. Also most of the good town folk already left anyway or got killed by the bad guys. I really enjoyed the movie because of this as most other westerns they make or remake these days involve quite a standard plot. Also the acting was quite nice too."

Signalons la pr\u00e9sence de notre abruti de footballeur qui se prend pour un acteur et qui dispose d'un r\u00f4le mono-expression \u00e0 la hauteur de son air ahuri : c'est fort distrayant.

      "text": "The Salvation \u2013 No Saving Graces Here  Seeing this was listed as a Danish movie had hoped for something different, tuned out to be a Danish Dumper. There should be a law stating that when a movie maker copies another\u2019s work they should pay some sort of fine \u2013 this Danish flick is a dismal rip-off of Leone\u2019s equally overblown \u2018Once Upon a Time in the West\u2019  which in turn was a rip-off of numerous American westerns and John Ford. All the tired old clich\u00e9s are trundled out shamelessly \u2013 the town full of cowardly citizens (including the sheriff) afraid to stand up to a bunch of ruthless bullies (who they actually seem to outnumber) The peace-loving settler whose family are for no good reason, cruelly destroyed - followed by the impossibly contrived revenge plot. The baddies are badder-than-bad and kill for little or no reason (just to manipulate an easily pleased audience into wanting them violently slaughtered)  The music imitates Morricone all over again, as do the camera angles and desert settings. This set-up is so tired it\u2019s almost sleep-inducing.  Strictly for lovers of copycat movies or the easily conned western geeks."
