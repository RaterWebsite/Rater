Isso \u00e9 muito importante para a narrativa, pois, junto com ele, vamos descobrindo como as coisas funcionam, e uma subvers\u00e3o de valores quanto aos EUA naquela guerra fica bem clara no segundo ato.Os personagens s\u00e3o \u00f3timos, e o tempo de tela dado a cada um os desenvolve muito bem. Os di\u00e1logos s\u00e3o \u00f3timos, e as interpreta\u00e7\u00f5es est\u00e3o no mesmo n\u00edvel. Willem Dafoe \u00e9 o meu favorito aqui. Charlie Sheen faz um \u00f3timo trabalho e Tom Berenger entrega o que peso que o antagonista precisa.A fotografia \u00e9 muito boa, principalmente nas cenas de a\u00e7\u00e3o, passando a confus\u00e3o e o terror da zona de guerra.

In typical Oliver Stone fashion, It didn't feel like you were watching one complete movie but more like watching an hour of two different ones. The story didn't blend well with the action scenes."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Classic movie and yes everyone should see it. There is not only action, but the focus is on the characters and how they are changed because of the terror of war. Great acting by all of them."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Amazing movie, I should've watched it a long time ago,but somehow did not and only watched it recently. It basically shows you what war really is and what it can do with people involved in it. Not only that, it also shows how the worst of the characters come out in those situations and you see people for what they really are."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Of all the movies inspired by the Vietnam War this is one of the most compelling. From the point of view of a young recruit, he revealed that the worst enemy was not only in the trench, but also in the mirror. The movie that it put director Oliver Stone in the spotlight."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Barbers Adagio for Strings feat. Charlie Sheen.A film that has now become synonymous with Barbers haunting score that forms the bedrock for the character study of these group of men we are thrown into awful conditions with fighting an enemy they cannot see or understand. What follows is a 2 hour experience of being dragged from one harsh set piece to the next being seen through the eyes of new recruit Chris played by a very young Charlie Sheen. The journey is shepherded by his 2 surrogate father figures played here excellently by Berenger and Defoe as they attempt to guide these young men from two very much opposing viewpoints.I first saw this when I was exploring war movies at a young age and consider this seminal viewing. This is a piece of work from Oliver Stone that would form the mould for many wartime movies to follow. Often mentioned in the same vein as Apocalypse Now, although two very different movies, both study its characters and look at how war and the atrocities seen can fundamentally change an individual. There are many big players here before they got famous, John C McGinley (from Scrubs fame) steals every scene he is in and Forrest Whitaker and Johnny Depp are also part of the supporting cast. The narrative thread is sometimes a little lacking and the main focus is to study one mans tour in 'Nam largely influenced by the directors own experiences of warfare during his time of service.Platoon is excellent. Its narrative by todays standards is slightly lacking with no real thread carrying things throughout apart from Defoe and Berenger fighting metaphorically for Charlie Sheens soul. As a study of the horrors of war during Vietnam it has rarely been done better and even now rewatching this many years later it is hard not to get choked up any time Barbers classic theme swells throughout the horrific images being displayed. If you are a war film connoisseur who hasn't seen this, you should probably rectify this immediately."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "everybody got one..PlatoonEmbracing and projecting the vulnerability, jealous and empathy Platoon is a fast paced character driven feature that has merely an idea on which it walks for 2 hours but gets in deep with the characters and explores more than expected. Writer-Director Oliver Stone captures some raw brutal scenes and attempts in empowering the characters through it, creating a perfect arc for the plot line but fails to ask for attention and offer gripping screenplay to the audience. Charlie Sheen seems a bit unsuitable for his protagonist role and doesn't quite justify its character whilst Willem Dafoe breathes life into the character and is outstanding as a supporting cast. Platoon takes big leaps on its first act and slows down on its second one until which the track becomes predictable on its climatic sequence."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "\uc804\ud22c\uc758 \uc561\uc158\uc5d0\ub9cc \uce58\uc911\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba74\uc11c \uc804\uc7c1\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c1\ud669\uc18d\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc778\uac04\uc131\ub4e4\uc744 \uc0dd\uc0dd\ud558\uac8c \ubb18\uc0ac\ud574 \ub0b8 \uc601\ud654\uc774\ub2e4. \uce90\ub9ad\ud130 \uac01\uc790\uc758 \uac1c\uc131\uacfc \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud569\ub9ac\uc801\uc778 \uadfc\uac70\ub85c \ub0a9\ub4dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud574\uc8fc\ub294 \uc644\uc131\ub3c4 \uc788\ub294 \uc791\ud488."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Vietnam war film directed by Oliver Stone and stars Charlie Sheen, Forrest Whitaker, Tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe... Pretty violent and bad language is present. Fairly decent story with some dumb characters, some likeable and the unlikeable Tom Berenger but what Platoon does throughout the dead bodies, bloodshed and violence is portray a fairly decent story and a reasonably powerful film.

It really does a great job of portraying the horrors and inhumanity of the Vietnam War. It's more of a hangout film, rather than story-driven. It invests a lot of time in the characters and atmosphere and invites the audience to immerse themselves in."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "\"Platoon\" delivers its share of brutality and morality during the non-sensical war in Vietnam. However, despite the good performances and sincere direction by Stone, by the end of the film, nothing has remotely left an impact in my mind about it. In a sea of war pictures that all vary in explaining and showing the understanding of such awful violence and yes, sometimes decisions, \"Platoon\" came across as just another war movie. For movie-goers and war historians, take it for what its worth as I've personally seen more inspiring works which deal with the consequences of war."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Fantastic movie, other than the beginning this movie was overall better than full metal jacket, but not nearly in the same arena as the king of war movies, saving private Ryan. It really shows you what it was like to serve in Vietnam back then and i am very happy i was not included in that war! Full of plot twists, this is a true masterpiece and is in my top 5 all time favorite war movies. This movie is up alongside Full Metal Jacket, 1917, and Hacksaw Ridge. Saving Private Ryan and American Sniper take the edge over this move in my opinion."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Another brutal and hellish war depiction, I really enjoyed all the characters, honestly Sheen's was probably the worst or least interesting of the bunch.
