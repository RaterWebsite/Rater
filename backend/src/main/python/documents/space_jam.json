On paper it does sound so crazy and insane but it delivers an entertaining experience. The story starts when Michael Jordan ended his NBA career in 1993 to become a baseball player (This really happened in real life and we all are still baffled why this even happened). Meanwhile the evil alien Mr. Swackhammer owner of a failing space amusement park need something to stop the decline. He wants the Looney Tunes and send his minions to get them no matter what (= persuasion with immense firepower;-). However his minions are tricked into giving the Looney Tunes a chance and because all are small and physically not intimidating they chose a game of basketball. Of cause this does not work as planned and the Looney Tunes need a tiny bit of help to quote Bugs Bunny. Like I said it sounds crazy but works well on the screen. It is just great slapstick, humor and entertainment in combination with Michael Jordan and basketball. There are so many that criticize this movie for its story and I cant understand them. This is a sports comedy with cheesy fun intended and not the Godfather, Schindlers List or a Shakespearean play. You would in reverse not criticize a drama for lack of humor. For me the story is a good vessel for the humor, characters and slapstick. It does a bit more than it needed. Then there is the cast. I don't need to introduce the Looney Tunes like Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, the Tasmanian Devil, Elmer Fudd, Yosemite Sam and all the others. They are popculture legends and probably in the most know fictional characters lists. They added a new character here with Lola Bunny. She worked well and was added to the rooster for the Looney Tunes and is still there today. For the human actors we have Michael Jordan as himself or the public image he has to keep up ;-). Then we have Bill Murray also as himself and he is as always an entertaining actor (Is it acting if he is himself?), Wayne Knight as Stan Podolak who delivers and of cause some of the best NBA players of that time like Charles Barkley, Shawn Bradley, Patrick Ewing, Larry Johnson and Mugsey Bogues as themselves in smaller roles. All deliver and I see no missteps here. Then there is the humor and slapstick. You get what you expected. Hilarious fun, great jokes and some abstruse cartoon violence. The humor works well and makes this movie worthwhile. The animation looked really good and captures the style of the Looney Tunes. After rewatching I say they created something that ages well and will not be criticized for it even after all the years. The soundtrack is also remarkable. The Monsters Anthem which actually is named Hit em High is a really powerful (bad guy) theme song, Fly like an Eagle by Seal is still excellent and R. Kellys I believe I can fly was still played in radio (until something happened which I will not mention here).  A good soundtrack with some memorable tracks. Overall this is an enjoyable movie you can watch and relax with. It is not perfect nor 10/10 material but still fun and with good humor."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Space Jam is a high-energy comedy that mixes live action, animation, cornball storytelling and rowdy humor into an energetic, gee-whiz confection that will probably delight just about everybody."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Space Jam is a happy marriage of good ideas--three films for the price of one, giving us a comic treatment of the career adventures of Michael Jordan, crossed with a Looney Tunes cartoon and some showbiz warfare."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Space Jam is a good fun, Goofy and Looney film.

Fortunately for 'Space Jam', it is a lot of fun, but unfortunately for the movie, it is too commercial. Angry and ambitious leader, Scratchhammer (voiced by Danny DeVito) is upset that his theme park is losing tourists and that nobody is interested in visiting anymore. He then tells his minions to grab the \"Looney Tunes\" in order to make them be able to attract tourists to the theme park. Meanwhile, we see Michael Jordan (played by himself) trying to cope playing baseball after retiring from basketball. He is then accompanied by Stan Podlack (Wayne Knight) who tries to offer what's best for him. Back at the animation world, the Looney Tunes come across the Scratchhammer's minions who try to blackmail them into working for the theme park. However, the Looney gang come up with an idea to challenge them to a basketball game since they're so small, the Looney gang won't have to lose. But, the little aliens have an idea in which they steal the talents of some big-name basketball players and end up absorbing it hence they inherit the skills of these respective players. The Looney Tunes then see this as an act of trouble, as they are so desperate, they kidnap Michael Jordan and bring him into the animated world. Trying to suspend disbelief, Jordan seems reluctant to help as he hasn't played basketball in a long time, and is worried that this may not be a good idea. 'Space Jam' benefits from a lot of good-natured humor that is fine for young audiences, and is silly enough for adults to even laugh at most of the physical slapstick jokes. It's a whole lot of fun as it moves at a fast pace, and is a visual feast. The big name cameos including Bill Murray himself, are also something adults can enjoy, not forgetting the references to these cameos. However, the movie is very commercial, and at times, some of the acting, even from Jordan himself - who is not an actor, so I shouldn't be harsh - is a little stale. The movie tries its best to combine the basketball superstar and the iconic animated characters, but, it's an uneasy mix of both. I admired 'Space Jam' more than I liked it or loved it, it's good for kids, fun for adults, and harmless overall. But maybe, don't try and shove too may plugs or else, it's just one big commercial."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "\"Space Jam\" was a good movie, because the animation mix with real action, was good, and the interpretation of Michael Jordan was unexpected, but the plot did not like anything."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "In the rap-music, slam-dunk, hysterical tumult of visual clutter that makes up most of Space Jam, the traditional Warner Bros.

While I think it has flaws, I think it is an entertaining and energetic film, not as good as \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" and \"Looney Tunes:Back in Action\" but an entertaining movie for Looney Tunes and basketball lovers(I admit I am more of a Looney Tunes fan). The story is a very nice idea, but there were parts when it was rather juvenile, likewise with some of the dialogue. Michael Jordan is a great athlete, and his skills are put to great use, but his acting isn't as impressive, it seems as though he is playing himself at times. Flaws aside, it is very funny with some great jokes and constant energy, and excellent supporting characters. Bill Murray, wearing clothes that you shouldn't ideally wear on a golf course, steals every scene he's in, and Danny DeVito is great fun as evil Swackhammer. The Looney Tunes are hilarious, especially Daffy, and technically with all the radiant colours the film works wonders. Overall, I like \"Space Jam\", it isn't Oscar worthy material, but it is fun to watch. 7/10 Bethany Cox"}, {"rating": "5", "text": "I have been watching this movie long before Metacritic can even make this a page, but I only managed to write a review of this movie because someone managed to mix the main theme of this movie (named Space Jam) with the classic remix of Rooftop Run seen on Sonic Generations. That attempt alone proves whether I should bring love to either the movie or the soundtrack thanks to the popularity of this movie even after 20 years of existing. Looking back to this movie now, it does get its major flaws from the attempt to bring the Looney Tunes to theaters. The only things that are nearly perfect compared to all the flaws in this movie are, of course, Lola Bunny's appearance and personality and the soundtrack alone. This movie is nearly harmless, which means this movie has its target audience set to the kids for easy positive reviews, and the fun wears off after the first time you see this movie. It also may not be the classical comedy you have seen on regular Looney Tunes cartoons, but it makes up a good chunk amount of laughs which unfortunately only last once or a few amount of times."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Pure 90s cheese.
