You pretty well know what your going to get from the trailer and the surprise plot twists were no surprise at all or they came completely out of left field and didn't  advance the story. Another complaint I have with the film is the pacing. The action tried to feel non-stop and frantic but the story takes place over a couple weeks not days. It just didn't flow. All in all I paid matinee price on a lazy afternoon and I'm not asking for my money back. If your a big Mark Walburg fan you'll find less fault with it."

I saw this movie because i thought it would be a good fun action film with alot of Mark Wahlberg kicking a$$, but there wasn't any of that. The Story was lackluster, the acting mediocre and the action wasn't there. I literally saw no action besides one 3 min scene, and by the review for this movie they make it look like Wahlberg is gonna do his usual thing and kick a$$ but he threw maybe 4 punches the whole movie. To sum it all up in two words, weak and disappointing describe this film perfectly, don't bother, even though its already been out awhile. 3.5/10"

So, now back to its old ways of the old smuggler order to save his family, but he is, or will be over his head?A pretty entertaining crime thriller. Mark Wahlberg is the title role, a tough guy like the old style. Kate Beckinsale as his wife alright, but it was not strong enough. Giovanni Ribisi is evil, it was awesome, enjoy it just does not like him. Lucas Haas and Ben Foster are also too good. In addition, a crime drama, really hard to satisfy you.

I thought that, it could be a good movie or be one of those movies were your like: \"I've seen this before and I know what's going to happen.\"This movie is about a man that has his family threatened and he's doing what ever it takes to make things right even if he has to go back to his old ways!Honestly, this is a good movie. I would definitely say this is worth seeing in the movie theaters. I enjoyed this movie. The movie to me felt real. I say real in the since that I could see this happening. Nothing in this movie feels far fetched and I like that. I think that is what gives this movie its breathe fresh air. I feel as though Mark Wahlberg and Giovanni Ribisi do a great job on the acting tip.Giovanni Ribisi is a actor that I would like to see in more movies. In any movie that I've seen him in, he really makes me feel his character. In this movie he plays a ruthless character. There's certain parts in the movie were he's kind of just sitting there staring at whatever and he just sells you on the ruthlessness his character is suppose to provide for the audience. He does a great job.I give this movie the rating of 8 out of 10. If you have a couple extra dollars on you and you want to see a movie. You have my permission to spend your money on this movie."

      "text": "Looking back, this past January has been very interesting as we had a mix of films. We've had great films like Haywire and The Grey. We've had your typical pieces of **** like The Devil Inside and One For The Money. Your typical January junk like Underworld. Mediocre films like Red tails and Joyful noise. So where does Contraband fit in all of this? Well it belongs in the better than your typical January junk but not as good as it should be category. This is better then the Crap that we're subjected to every January but that doesn't excuse it's problems.\r For starters, nothing in this movie is original. Usually filmmakers will take something that's been done before and put their own fresh twists to it, that's not the case here. You've seen this all before and done better. Next is the plot, it's not that there's too little of it, there's too much of it and for what? If your going to make a movie that's been done a bunch of times before at least stick to the formula. Don't try to make it complex, it's not going to change the fact that this is unoriginal. Lastly, this film has an unappealing gritty look which was a bit of a turn off for me. It's not that I don't like it, it works well with other movies but it was unnecessary.\r Despite some glaring problems, there's some fun to be had. The action scenes are fun, and there are moments of humor sprinkled throughout. Usually most of the humorous moments are a result of a character doing the most moronic thing possible. The pacing is a little off but it shouldn't bother people that much. The acting ranges from okay to pretty good. While Mark Wahlberg's performance isn't bad but, he just kind of goes through the motions. He has shown he can act but here he is kind of Idle. Kate Beckinsale is sadly underused, she's good but she doesn't have that important of a part. Giovanni Ribisi on the other hand is pretty good. He has fun chewing at his lines and just being a complete badass. He's probably the best thing about this movie. Contraband is slightly better than your typical January junk that we're subjected to every year. However, it still can't come over the the fact that it's not original, the plot is unnecessarily complex, the pacing is a tad off, and that the overall look is unappealing. despite the action being fun and intense, it being funny, and pretty decent performances."

I wish I could say Contraband was an amazing film, but it was your typical, shoot 'em up action thriller, although the plot was better than most. A lot of critics bashed this film because of its predictability, but what do you expect from these types of films? The story, about an ex-smuggler, returning to his old ways to pay off an unexpected debt, was easy to follow and full of cool action sequences. That's really all you can ask for from these films and I rather enjoyed it. If you don't like action movies, don't watch them! If you do like them, Contraband is a pretty good one and few action stars bring to the table the experience that Whalberg has. If you're looking for something that you don't really have to think about, that will hold your attention, and kill a couple of hours, go with Contraband."

It was a good movie to watch, and surprisingly my wife requested that we go and see it(probably because of Mark Wahlberg) so apparently you may be able to not claim this as your movie choice and avoid another chick flick next time. There were a few twists and turns in the movie, but nothing you couldn't really figure out if your paying attention. I thought the pace was good and it did not have any slow parts that left you wanting to leave the theater. Characters and choice of actors was pretty good as well, besides Wahlberg and beckinsale most were relatively unknown or not mainstream but probably strong up anc comers.

Kate Beckinsdale is really just window dressing caught up in the drama.\r Character development isn't top priority and the film suffers because of it but in the end for a short and punchy heist film, that gives an interesting insight into the world of international smuggling, you could do worse."

You may have a vague and general idea of where the movie might be going but you don't have time to really predict what comes next after most every scene. The story is not complicated, just fast paced and loaded with material, like Shooter, and the twists that punctuate the whole story are unpredictable just as in Shooter. The official movie outline gives you a fair idea of the type of movie it is.\r Very good cast. Giovanni Ribisi plays the bad guy very well; I say this because if you despise the character, as you most certainly will, then he's done his job well. He has. Then you have J.K. Simmons, who has never failed to deliver a good performance in any of the numerous movies I've seen him in, still keeping that record intact. He plays Captain Camp, a crusty and tough cargo ship captain who has every reason to suspect the notorious smuggler Chris Faraday, played by Mark Wahlberg; what you don't expect is what he does about it and how Faraday turns the table on him. That was good writing on the part of either Aaron Guzikowski or the writers of the original 2008 Icelandic/German/Dutch production \"Reykjavik-Rotterdam\"; I can't tell who came up with it.\r Ben Foster has in my opinion the most difficult part to play as Sebastian. I don't want to spoil things by saying more other than he delivers a good performance, not unlike a character he has often played. Kate Bekinsale plays the wife of Wahlberg, a recalcitrant victim if ever there was one (perhaps Jennifer Lopez in 2002 \"Enough\" was a tougher one) and she complements Walberg's role quite well. The actors I mentioned and a few more were all quite busy as this movie has lots of action meat. I don't think you'll be disappointed with the movie, and I recommend it to my friends."

It is a performance vehicle for any A-lister (in this case, Mark Wahlberg, whose role seems to be custom made for him), it is confusing and far-fetched, it has it's share of thrilling moments, and it is easily forgotten, but not entirely painlessly. Contraband is basically a genre film, a heist pic that has the overall tone of a reversed Ocean's movie. But that trilogy had a far more easygoing nature about it, while still being hard to follow and absurd. This movie is all too serious and in the finale, it takes a tonal U-turn and becomes light-hearted, betraying itself, as if the past hour-and-a-half didn't happen. It becomes oddly watchable before that, but otherwise Contraband is just toss-away entertainment."

Most prominent in terms of violence are gun fights and there are car chases but few in the way of large CGI effects. Also worth mentioning is the use of subtitles which feature fairly regularly (given its partly set in Panama), so if your really not keen on reading subtitles then this may be a downside for you but I didn't find them too hard to follow.There are some good landscape shots of the areas, in Panama and the port etc. The characters are pretty predictable overall, I'd say, with the main character Chris being your typical macho action man type, putting up a steely front as it were.Its quite a suspenseful movie I'd say, with the ocassional bland scene but for the most part there's something going on to keep you entertained. I noticed that this is quite a dark movie, not only in tone and content but also in terms of the lighting (or lack thereof), with many of the scenes featuring the characters in low light or partially/mainly in the dark.As an action movie its ok - its pretty gritty with some engaging scenes and features eye candy for both men (Kate Beckinsale) and women (Mark Wahlberg).  I found it to be quite claustrophobic and become more sinister towards the end of the movie, as peoples legitimacy is questioned. I wouldn't say this movie breaks any new ground but for what it is, its decent enough. I wouldn't call it a particularly memorable movie but its certainly quite watchable and suspenseful in parts, so I'm giving this a 5 out of 10 rating overall."
