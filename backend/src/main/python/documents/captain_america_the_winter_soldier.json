This is the question that I would like to have had answered a lot earlier than is actually the case here. By the time some sort of resolution is offered one really couldn't care less. In fact this Marvel-less movie is a thorough going bore. Aside from a few sequences (involving a lift, and a climatic fight aboard an artillery carrier) most of the action is un excitingly derivative. In between these set pieces we have a lot of waffle spoken in an attempt to build character, but this only extends the agony of an already over long film. Visual effects are impressive, generally, although one static shot of the three artillery stations does look very fake.\rIt is good to see Robert Redford playing a villain for a change although he must obviously be doing it for the money. After all, didn't he set up Sundance as an alternative to this kind of movie regularly churned out by the Hollywood machine.\rFans of the first film, I'm sure, will love it and will stay (if in the know) for the two sequences that arrive during, and at the end of the final credits.

The plot, which looks to have drawn influences from exposing deceptive, blurred lines between the good and bad seen from cold war era spy movies, is very intricate and well-woven, and the action sequences are very satisfying to watch, all of this supported with good quality production. The Captain America series just gets better after each movie!"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "The future sure has been quite a time for Captain America (Chris Evans). His first encounter with the modern world saw him running through Times Square, confused and scared. Next, he assembled with some other Superheroes to save the world from the disgruntled brother of a fellow Avenger. In Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Cap faces off against an internal threat and an organization that is just as powerful as S.H.I.E.L.D, as well as a familiar face and new adversary from his past. Life is rough for Cap. On top of everything, he is still trying to find a way to successfully assimilate himself into present day society. You think saving the world is hard? Try figuring out the internet, getting back on the dating scene, and making new friends at the age of ninety-five. Thankfully, there are only a few things Cap needs to get through the day; his trusty vibranium shield and his handy notepad with a slew of suggestions for catching up with the last seventy years, and Cap is ready to take on the world\u2013or corrupt government organizations. Either or, Cap is always ready to save the day, even if he has to take a beating while doing it.\r When I first became aware that the directing/producing brothers behind episodes of  \u2019Community\u2019 and You, Me and Dupree were going to be responsible for  extending the Captain America canon, I may have gotten a little worried. Thinking that Joe and Anthony Russo were going to follow in the same footsteps as Captain America: The First Avenger director Joe Johnson, focusing more on the comedy and special effects of the Superhero genre and less with the complex, unflinching patriotic mentality of America\u2019s greatest super soldier, the Russo brothers sure proved me wrong. It\u2019s movies like these that make happy to swallow my words and stand corrected, knowing that audience members are able trust that the television medium is one that can be used as an adequate platform towards advancing characters in film as well.\r Substituting as much VFX work as possible for a very organic and old-school action approach, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is certainly the best Phase Two Marvel film so far, and may perhaps be the standard film to compete against in a post-Avengers film world, or at least up until the Avengers: Age of Ultron.\r Always on a mission, it seems that Cap lives to work, not works to live. Especially since he has been in deep sleep for the last little while. While the United States government is surely getting the most out of their ridiculously expensive investment, the government trusts that their super solider is never compromised and his dedication and hard work to his country is never skewed. When a secret organization with similar interests to those of S.H.I.E.L.D threaten to kill twenty million people, Cap is sent to fight at sea, on land, and in the air. Accompanied by his trusty sidekick Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), the two seem to always be pitted within the same missions but always having ulterior motives. Commanded by their one-eyed superior Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), S.H.I.E.L.D must face off against their most ruthless enemy yet.\r One of the biggest issues I will continue to have with Marvel\u2019s stand-alone films from now on, is the fact that once conflict reaches a certain level of danger, like lets say a global level, I will always ask, \u201cWhere the heck are the Avengers? And if not the Avengers, where is Tony Stark? The Hulk? Someone? Anyone?\u201d No problem could be too big for the super-powered team of freedom fighting Superheroes. This is one film where I questioned the presence of Tony Stark? Was he just waiting to see what Cap would do on the other side of the country while he sat at home on his couch?\r Essentially, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a team effort in crime fighting, with Black Widow and Sam Wilson/The Falcon (Anthony Mackie) helping out are star-spangled Superhero this time around, Cap sure doesn\u2019t seem to be without powerful friends. What was also refreshing was finally seeing Nick Fury get in on the action, providing the film with one of the best car chase scene Marvel ever assembled. One of the virtues of Captain America: The Winter Soldier stands by is the fact that, you don\u2019t need to wear a mask to be a Superhero\u2013which might explain why Cap always insists on removing his.\r At times, the film may seem like Marvel\u2019s take on Minority Report anticipating danger before it even happens, and upholding the idea of \u2018peace\u2019 for the sake of the world. But as the Head of S.H.I.E.L.D operations ironically points out, \u201cpeace is not an achievement, its a responsibility\u201d. So when S.H.I.E.L.D is corrupted from the inside, right under their noses and Cap is left to face-off against a super-soldier baddie, later known as the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), the organization really has some explaining to do."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Way better then the first movie which only seemed to be a vehicle to help promote the Avengers. This a stand alone movie and with a little background anyone could be caught up to speed even without seeing the first one. This one will be put into the blu ray collection as well as maybe buying the first one just to help my gf catch up a little more on the whole background of the Avengers and Capt America. This movie started to make me a fan I wont go out and start buying up the older comics like I have with Avengers but I am very excited for 2016 and Capt America 3."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Best Phase II Marvel movie.  Shows what you can do with a Marvel movie, good script and some good ideas.  It has the feel of an old school 90s action movie as well a little bit of political thriller thrown on top.  The cgi is more disciplined here than in the first one.  I liked Robert Redford as the bad dude and he plays it great, like it was his character from the Candidate won a secretary of state position.  This is my favorite of the phase II Marvel movies, yes I liked it more than Gaurdians.  I believe it is the best Marvel movie since the first Iron Man."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "There\u2019s no point in denying that the new Captain America movie is anything less than another instalment in the superhero saturation of the last ten years, but although the Captain himself has been considered the blandest of the bunch, at least as far as The Avengers (2012) is concerned. It\u2019s still a fantastic world of unbelievable stunts and perfectly timed one-liners, but the new film offers a lot more depth than some of the weaker superhero fare on offer.\r In addition to the ambitious Marvel Cinematic Universe, the rich tapestry of interwoven stories that Disney\u2019s Marvel Studios has been crafting at the rate of about two blockbusters a year since 2008\u2019s Iron Man, we have seen everything from the unrelated narratives of Marvel\u2019s Spiderman and X-men series, to the gritty reboots of rival DC classics like Superman and Batman. The Marvel Universe alone is an unprecedented shared universe multimedia franchise, extending from the silver screen to various short films, television series and tie-in comic books.\r Wanton American patriotism is far from internationally popular, and the challenge with Captain America as a character is to give this bastion of United States glory modern appeal. The first film took the character back to his roots, giving us a brilliant pulp action adventure, set during the character\u2019s 1940s heyday.\r This was an easy place to be Captain America, but after being dragged into the twenty first century in time for The Avengers, Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) must work out what America stands for today, and decide what he represents. The temporal displacement is a rich vein to be mined for soul searching and character interpretation.\r As a pawn of SHIELD, the superhero intelligence organisation: our Nazi-punching hero has been reduced to a shady covert operative who is unsure if the missions he is sent on are aiding or abetting the forces of evil. This insecurity comes to a head when he learns of SHIELD\u2019s Project Insight, a sinister initiative which operates under the twin axes of surveillance and pre-emptive strikes, undeniably referencing drone controversy and the concerns over US internal surveillance. Thus The Winter Soldier is an espionage thriller, firmly rooted in modern day concerns, but with a style heavily influenced, according to the directors, by cold war conspiracy thrillers from the 1970s.\r Events are still very much rooted in the events of the first film, mysterious forces have been working in the background since the end of the war, and the Captain finds himself battling enemies both old and new. Symbolically, he trades his brand new twenty first century black and navy blue uniform for his bright red, white and blue wartime clobber before the film is out.\r As is the case with many comic book movies, I am impressed to learn that much which transpires on screen, no matter how incredible or brief, is in fact distilled from the original comics over their seventy year history. I\u2019m certainly not the one to personally notice all this detail, but it\u2019s apparently crammed full of nods to various eras, arcs and character backgrounds.\r The characterisation of Falcon, real name Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), was strong. An Air Force veteran, he shares Rogers\u2019 military background and helps him adjust to the modern world. Later, he demonstrates his loyalty when he is called upon once the Captain becomes a fugitive.\r Of course, the question having over every post-Avengers solo movie is why characters neglect to call in their superpowered chums to save the day in a fraction of the time. There is a slight aversion in that Captain America does spend the whole film working closely with fellow Avenger Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), who has been largely sidelined in her previous appearances. The truth is that having fewer lead characters mean more attention can be given to others, and Johansson is finally given some significant screen time. Black Widow\u2019s alluring presence is welcome throughout, her moral ambiguity and chequered past providing a stark contrast to the Captain\u2019s clear cut integrity.\r Similarly, SHIELD director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) is much more important to the story than the cameo status he has held until now. By contrast, the eponymous Winter Soldier, a bionic badass bearing Soviet livery has little screen time, initially filling the role of unbeatable enforcer to the villains, and the only individual strong enough to challenge the Captain, but his tragic presence is vital to the overarching saga. Also noteworthy is Robert Redford\u2019s appearance as a sinister SHIELD executive.\r Freedom, the most American of values, nevertheless carries a global relevance, and remains a major theme, but any overt patriotism is relatively, and wisely downplayed, despite the character\u2019s name and apparent raison d\u2019\u00eatre. What\u2019s left is a solid conspiracy blockbuster, with the superhero status incidental aside from enabling higher octane action sequences than a subtler spy movie."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I never saw the first Capt America, but I did see the avengers and to be honest didnt like him there.

If \"Captain America: First Avenger\" turned out to be pleasant and full of quality, this film proved to be a worthy continuation. It will not be correct to say that I was surprised: Marvel has provided us with excellent productions, and it is difficult, therefore, to keep expectations low. However, in the end, I was satisfied.The plot goes back to Steve Rogers' past to reveal the existence of a rival to his height: the Winter Soldier, a super soldier, like Captain America, whose origins and past are closely related to Rogers. I don't know if this story is faithful to what is told in the comic books, but I also feel that, for me, it doesn't matter. The plot is developing well, with space for action and the fight scenes are good and seem real.Chris Evans returns to the role of Captain America, and he is skilled, heroic and energetic. Samuel L. Jackson and Robert Redford also do an excellent job, at the level of the best they have done so far in their long careers. Scarlett Johansson and Anthony Mackie seem to have received characters tailored to them, especially Johansson. Sebastian Stan is good, but he didn't get my attention much. Emily VanCamp is good, but her character is not very relevant and is not very interesting.But where this film really excelled was in the quality of production values, and the most technical aspects. Cinematography, for example, is sharp, elegant, with excellent filmmaking and an absolute command of color, movement, and shadows, which make the film visually extraordinary. Add to that the grandeur of the visual effects, the latest generation CGI and, of course, the action and fighting scenes, and the result is overwhelming. The sets and costumes also deserve a note of great praise: I especially liked the sets at the Avengers headquarters, a futuristic and elegant complex that seems to have been taken from an urban planning project in an Asian city. The aircraft also look magnificent and impress. The soundtrack, on the other hand, is quite good, it fits perfectly in the film, but I confess that it was not in my ear and that I did not find it particularly memorable."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Probably the best MCUmovie, very good story, excellent action.

Robert Downey Jr. was the first to suit up for the third Iron Man outing and his fourth for the franchise overall. The third entry in the Iron Man franchise proved to be riding the wave of the massively successful Avengers, taking a huge haul at the box office. Next up was Chris Hemsworth as the muscle bound god of thunder Thor.\rBoth proved to be successes, the former continuing to impress while the latter was better than the first outing but still left plenty of room for improvement. But the first avenger to start it all was Steve Rogers as Captain America, his first film was good but not great, it had a wonderful retro feel to its first half until it took an explosive and predictable path for its final hour, each event leading into The Avengers. Cap was always difficult to put in front of an audience that nowadays demands darkness and gritty realism over charm and light-hearted antics. He stands for goodness and doing what's right, something that isn't very sought after in modern day heroics.\rBut in this sequel to the 2011 film, it's a different time and a much different film. Not only does it improve upon the last solo outing, but it could very well be the best film to come out of the Marvel franchise so far. The man who was frozen in time returns with Chris Evans again putting the famous shield on his arm, he now works for S.H.I.E.L.D. who continue to be a very secretive organisation which Cap is determined to get to the bottom of. He works closely alongside fellow operative Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). The witty chemistry between these two is easily one of the highlights of the film, even in the stickiest of situations, the writers manage to infuse some comic relief that works every time. But the threat this time in the film is much closer to home as S.H.I.E.L.D. itself is the centre of attention for all the wrong reasons. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) is given a much larger and more pivotal role in the Winter Soldier, the more Sam Jackson the better if you ask me! The story plays out in thrilling fashion as a mole within headquarters has each of our good guys on their hit list. The great alliance is now in tatters and someone that Cap has never dealt with is hunting himself and his friends down. Who better to send after them than the mythical Winter Soldier, he may just seem like a master assassin with a metal arm and anger issues, but there is much more of a story going on behind the mask that plays a part in a film that finds balance between emotional repercussions while also entertaining the fans with explosive set pieces, thrilling fist fights and a fantastic car chase involving director Fury, it all packs a heavy punch while infusing the film with superior wit and charm, especially from supporting cast member Anthony Mackie who dons a familiar pair of wings as the plot unfolds. The story delves very deep into the history of the S.H.I.E.L.D organisation while also outlining the problems that face a company who is trying to do everything right by preventing crime before it happens, \"What about freedom?\" the Cap asks, always there to detail the line between right and wrong. Chris Evans himself is on fine form and he acts out a very emotional script that paints Steve Rodgers as a man who is unsure about what to do with his life after the secrets of the people he works for start to unravel. It pays homage to the first film while also solidifying itself as possibly the best Marvel film so far, it has everything that could possibly be imagined and just when you think that it can't get any better, Robert Redford shows his face along with several other strong characters, there are surprises at every turn but enough of the same characters we've come to know from previous films to add up an adventurous, pulsating and epic adventure that could be the best film of the year.

The script is well written. It is filled with great relevant social commentary about our government and major organizations and how they preserve freedom by reistricting it. However, while the script is fairly heavy, it does manage to have enough fun Marvel humor that we\u2019ve all come to love.\r One thing in particular that I love about this movie is that it gives a lot of respect to its characters. The Captain himself is show to be more than just a leader. He can hold his own, but is also a great human being. Chris Evans has finally owned the character and it\u2019s hard seeing anyone else play him. We also get more backstory to Natasha a.k.a Black Widow.

The Winter Soldier is a pretty awesome villain, who I believe to be the best villain from the Marvel Cinematic universe only behind Loki.\r Overall, \u201cCaptain America:The Winter Soldier\u201d is a fairly entertaining and surprisingly thought provoking movie that is stepping up the quality of the modern superhero movie genre. It has everything from great characters, to an engaging and honest story, to some of the best action we\u2019ll get this year.

Nonetheless, i did enjoy it a little, but it's definitely not Marvel's best movie, not by any means."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Easily one of my favorite movies to come out of Marvel yet, the sequel for Captain America is a solid, enjoyable movie that really attempts to go above and beyond its genre, while also retaining elements that just make it another superhero movie. In terms of the political commentary, Captain America's sequel soars above most other superhero movies. It uses its position as a popular movie to try and bring up things  that it feels could occur in our world if we continue down the path we are going down. However, it then returns to stereotypical superhero nonsense and, generally, feels like a run-of-the-mill summer superhero movie. Sure, it is one, and is a good one at that, but that does not mean it could not step up in \"class\" a bit. On top of that, I felt the story was too much. The whole world is being threatened and all that it is being defended by is Captain America, The Black Widow, and Anthony Mackie? Really? Did Iron Man, Hulk, and Thor, call in sick that day or...? The plot was very interesting and really makes this movie what it is, but it felt more appropriate for the second Avengers movie, rather than the sequel for Captain America.\r In terms of acting, everyone did very well. Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, and Samuel L. Jackson, really led the way with that. Also, the character development was great and unexpected for this movie. The amount of development they did here, coupled with the ending and post credits scene, really set up the upcoming third film nicely."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Wow. If the main problem about phase 2 up until this point was it's lack of connection to the MCU then this movie is exactly what was needed. The story is thrilling, the characters are great, the acting is top notch and the action is some of the best that I've ever seen. Plus there's all the huge game changing moments that'll be effecting the MCU for years to come."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Though it may not abide religiously to its subtitle, \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\" remains a spine-tinglingy well-staged, frighteningly relevant, and brilliantly monumental addition to the Marvel/Disney dynasty."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Miles away better than The Amazing Spider-man 2. and could even rival films like The Avengers and The Dark Knight, the acting was fantastic, and the action scenes were some of the best I've ever seen. Brilliant film."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I don't give 10's out lightly.  There is nothing wrong with this action film.  Great story.  Great action and cgi.  Funny.  Great characters.  The only thing I would have added would have been a last second cameo of Iron Man.  Marvel does a bad job when it comes to forgetting about other characters that still exist in this world.  If you don't want them in the movie, you better come up at least a mention as to why they are not here.  Remember when they kept referring to the Thor hammer in the desert in a few other Marvel movies?\r For an action movie this is a 10.  I would have given the first Avenger movie a 5."}], "recommendations": ["captain_america_civil_war", "x_men_days_of_future_past", "the_league_of_extraordinary_gentlemen", "black_widow", "mission_impossible_rogue_nation", "creed_ii", "captain_america_the_first_avenger", "you_only_live_twice", "conan_the_barbarian", "stargate", "master_and_commander_the_far_side_of_the_world", "the_eagle", "hellboy_ii_the_golden_army", "creed", "news_of_the_world", "the_martian", "valkyrie", "the_magnificent_seven", "spider_man_far_from_home", "american_made", "war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes", "wonder_woman", "iron_man", "12_strong", "jack_ryan_shadow_recruit"]}
