      "text": "Is a 2020 horror film featuring an absurd comedy. The film is neither funny nor scary. The actors and characters are so carefully selected that they are all antipathetic. It's one of the most annoying and time-wasting movies I've ever seen. A group of 4 people are going to rob a mansion. They find a safe November, but they can't open it. Then they are waiting for the old couple who owns the house. They're getting into trouble on their own trying to scare them off. It's a really ridiculous movie.There are scenes in the film that contain sexuality in places."
