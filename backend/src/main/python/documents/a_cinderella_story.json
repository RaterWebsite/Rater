It's a great experience for all  friends,family and even if you watch it alone. The only thing i didn't get is  how is it possible for him not to recognize her after the Halloween party? I mean her voice, face and attitude?... that's probably the only reason i'm not giving it a bigger score.

This movie is too implausible to make sense. They tried to put their own little spin from the original but it just did not work for teenagers in today's age. At about the twenty minute you are begging for the two to hook up already but it feels like it takes forever. If you want to take Cinderella from animated to real life there has to be much more care and effort involved."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "It grat there no words to describe it."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "You call this a movie?

This is in no way funny, or even a way to get young teens of the 21st century into Cinderella. I get that it's \"Cinderella for the digital age\", but it's not funny, not interesting, and downright, unbearable to watch.\r Hilary Duff is fine in the lead role, but there are times where her character just seems unlikable at times, you know it's problematic when the lead character who you're supposed to identify with, is not likable at all. Don't even get me started on Jennifer Coolidge as the evil stepmother, whoever gave this woman a comedy career clearly doesn't know what comedy is, she was never funny...or at least I don't find her funny.\r There is nothing else I can say...this movie is just bad."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Best movie of all time.
