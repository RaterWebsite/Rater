The director can now add yet another cinematic abomination to his hysterical resume. Ditto for Cage, who looks ludicrous. WICKER MAN and GHOST RIDER in the same year? Bravo. Almost as good as his last double-play: WEATHER MAN and LORD OF WAR. Cage time and again manages to limbo under the low, low bar he set in CON AIR. Basically, Coppola's nephew keeps churning out the virtuoso performances. When will Nic Cage be exposed for the ham and fraud he is? Another 20 mil for the hack. Yeah, I know he was in Leaving Las Vegas, but he's long since spent whatever capital he earned from that.

I was really hoping for a scary and exciting superhero movie. But after watching what was so suppose to be excellent, this was pure crap. First off, the so-called horrorifying visuals and fight sequences sucked. They really bored the crap out of me. Second, the screenplay was just absolutely terrible. I mean seriously, a 5 year old could have wrote this. Third, there was some bad acting. Not all the actors were terrible, but Eve Mendes was just bad. She may look sexy, but she really couldn't pull off her character (Roxane). The storyline may be somewhat decent, but overall, it's just a terrible comic book rip-off."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "I've changed my rating for this movie many times as I've gotten older. Hopefully, this will be the last time. Ghost Rider starring Nicholas Cage, Wes Bentley and some other people. Yes it's so bad I don't even remember who else was in it because every character is changed for the sequel so, who cares. Oh wait Eva Mendes, she was in it. Okay so as always let's start with the bad. Nicholas Cage is awful, awful, awful as Johnny Blaze. They could have casted the guy from The Room and it would have been better. See the problem is he should have known he couldn't act with a terrible script provided by Mark Steven Johnson so he should have just given a Wicker Man performance. Unfortunately, his performance is awful because it's forgettable. There was not a single memorable quote in this movie at all. Not to mention zero character development. They barley gave a name for Eva Mendes' character. The visuals aren't even that great and that jacket is so cheesy, it gave me chills just looking at it. Also, there were so many puns that weren't funny in anyway. As for the good parts of the movie, well they weren't really good. There really just the okay parts that made me not give this movie a 0 rating. Anyway, Sam Elliot gives a decent somewhat cheesy performance. The only pretty good part of this movie was the graveyard scene which was well executed and exciting. In the end, Ghost Rider is poorly acted, badly written, filled with somewhat bland special effects and bad puns. Ultimately despite some redeeming moments, Ghost Rider receives a 2/10 score."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "There's not one good thing i can say about this movie."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "One of the worst movies ever to be created, terrible acting, terrible story, terrible special effects, terrible casting.

Plus the films about a biker with a flaming skull for a head, BADass.\r -Guilty pleasure film gets 7/10"}, {"rating": "3", "text": "A few days ago, Ghost Rider star Nicolas Cage made news by defending his appearance in a film based on a comic book by summoning up names like Goethe and Thomas Mann, and talking about comics' potential to reintroduce timeless themes in a \"pop-art contemporary manner.\" And he's absolutely right. Or he would be if he were talking about Batman Begins or the Spider-Man series, recent comic-book adaptations that got both the spectacle and the depth right. But he couldn't have been talking about Ghost Rider.\r Cage is a comic-book fan from way back (he has a son named Kal-El, and his own stage name comes from Marvel hero Luke Cage), and he's circled around comics-inspired movie projects for years. Too bad he landed on this one, which reinvents a bizarre Marvel hero born of a 1970s enthusiasm for motorcycle-stunt heroics. Director Mark Steven Johnson previously botched an adaptation of Daredevil by being unable to decide what kind of movie he wanted to make. Here, that isn't a problem, assuming he set out solely to make the kind that fills moviegoers with buyers' remorse.\r Played in the opening scenes by young actor Matt Long, future Ghost Rider Johnny Blaze inadvertently brokers a deal with Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) to save his father from cancer, only to watch his dad die in a motorcycle crash the next day. (There's always a catch with those supernatural pacts, isn't there?) Understandably upset, he embarks on a career of daredevil stunt-riding, gaining fame and fortune by jumping across football fields. But when Fonda comes calling, Cage gets transformed into a supernatural force for vengeance with a flaming skull-head and the ability to ride his motorcycle up the side of skyscrapers.\r Any potential the film had for making pop art in a contemporary manner is drained away by the familiar demands of second-tier action blockbusters. Cage has some fun with the role, making Blaze a kind of Zen Elvis with a strange fixation on Carpenters songs, but the film's priorities lie with the digital effects and not the story, and even the effects aren't that hot. Eventually, Ghost Rider devolves into a long fight between Fonda's even more evil son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) and Ghost Rider, with Cage largely disappearing to make room for a CGI flaming skull. At least they got the cheekbones right."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Ghost Rider. The most insane punisher. A dynamic and sometimes funny (thanks to Nicolas Cage) film.

I really wanted to know what this badass dude is capable of doing, so I saw Marvel's TL;DR video on it. I really loved the idea. So I thought let's give the movie a try. And, well, here I am.The movie begins with a narration. The black and white flashing effects could make any Indian TV serial look like a flipping virgin. Once that was done, the scene changed to the young Johnny Blaze as the stunt driver. He accidentally sells his soul to the Devil, and now the Devil cures his father of a disease which was never talked about before. And suddenly Daddy Blaze dies because Devil wanted to not let Johnny have any relations. And I COULD have believed that, except that Johnny still gets to be with all his friends and he VOLUNTARILY leaves his girlfriend.One very weird habit about Johnny Blaze is the way he points his finger at people and says \"You!\". He does it as a child, he does it as an adult. I'm supposing this wasn't a thing in the comics, and even if it was it could have been done away with, since it wasn't something important and it looked stupid.After he grows up to be Nicholas Cage, he has become a stunt rider who defies the laws of physics using badly edited scenes. When he finds Roxanne played by Eva Mendes aka discount Priyanka Chopra, he starts talking to her awkwardly about her personal life in front of the camera even though he could have done it before or after the interview. And Roxie leaves him because she isn't interested in him anymore. Like, then why did you even come to take his interview? It's established that she's the boss so she could have sent one of her employees to do it.And then Johnny drives behind Roxie in a poorly done green screen and promises her that he will meet her at dinner. But then a new villain, Blackheart comes up with a Bollywood-style CGI entrance and a terribly executed jumpscare. Because of him Johnny turns into Ghost Rider and does everything except doing the very thing for which he had been made Ghost Rider.And the next day when he meets Roxie she doesn't believe the person she's interviewing. Like, read the room, Roxie! The road is melted with motorcycle tyre marks. What makes you think she's lying? And then at night Johnny tells her that he becomes a monster every night. And Roxie says he shouldn't make excuses about this. Normally we'd have accepted this scene, but just one scene ago he was shown to make fireballs with his hands. So why didn't he just make one in front of her to prove it?And then he fights an air dude who's that generic \"Ha ha ha! You can't beat me! I am... no wait, wha... NOOOOO!\" type guy. After that Ghost Rider fights and kills Blackheart, Devil comes back to take his powers. But Johnny refuses. It was supposed to look like a very touching moment signifying that Johnny hated his powers but now grew into liking them, but it didn't feel anything like that. Throughout the movie he only felt like he was okay with these powers and they didn't bother him much.This movie has done everything badly - the score was terrible, the scene cuts looked sudden, the CGI was terrible for 2007 (Superman Returns came a year ago and nailed the CGI), the acting was Raspberry-worthy. The only reason I'm giving this 3 is because it's Ghost Rider. At least they tried. And also because it's so bad that it's hilarious."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "One of the worst comic book adaptions I've seen.Corny dialogue, a lazy script and some dull action scenes combine to produce this train wreck of a movie."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "What a Horrible Marvel Movie!
