This just falls under the so bad it's good category, but barely (hence the 2 rating).  While my wife and I were entertained during certain scenes it was typically for things that weren't supposed to be entertaining.  The acting was atrocious, with Forrest Whitaker looking as though someone off screen is poking him with a stick trying to force him to act.  The dialog along with its complete lack of logic being laughably bad coupled with a lack of comprehension of basic physics.  Unfortunately we were more bored than entertained by the flaws of this disaster of a movie and really can't recommend it to anyone."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "I ve seen my share of movies.

The dialogue and plot are thin on the ground to start with and the movie is, for the most part a road movie with zero fun along the way. If only the 'skip' feature on the Netlfix app was faster, I would've skipped through the last two thirds of the film. Unfortunately it is not. Sad for the actors mostly (Whom I normally enjoy watching), but they aren't given much of anything to deliver, apart from all the cursing which I'm sure the directory insisted they use to somehow make it feel more dramatic, but only cheapened an already worthless movie. My Advice = don't bother and instead enjoy a re-viewing of \"The Edge of Tomorrow\" ;) - 2/10 Points for animation and effects"}, {"rating": "1", "text": "This movie is bad.  If you like bad movies that aren't any good, this is the one you want.  The treatment of female characters is a crash course on how to make a sexist movie thirty years ago.

A boring, cliche-ridden mess that tries to convince you that within 2 days of a grid failure, Americans turn into monsters who kill for gas and have no sense of humanity left.

Just a dumb pretext to show U.S. civilians waving and shooting guns at eachother like it's \"normal\" to be a civilian and have a gun, like it makes you more of a man. Throw in a mediocre script that seems made for a run of the mill story-driven console game, sprinkle in some earthquakes and dust/ash clouds signalling a disaster that is never explained, and done: you've got yourself a 90-minute time-waster.Best-case, they could've condensed what little worthwhile story points there are in this into like 20-30 minutes and made a \"people talking in a room\" type movie that might've been decent."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Cliched paranoid male power fantasies wrapped around tropes, that comes to an abrupt end when the director ran out of money.  In a setting crying out for inquisitiveness, they play it safe by not trying to expain anything to avoid being shown as mystery box peddlers.  Standard Netflix fare just crossed from mediocreland to the wasteland."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "How it ends has a great aesthetic to it and you might well enjoy it if you don't go into it expecting a hollywood style disaster movie. It's a long movie with a slow pace, for me it was just the break I needed from the noisy mess most disaster movies turn out to be.The moments between the protagonist and his would be father in law are well acted and there is a sense of tangibility to the events that unfold throughout the movie. As a viewer you have no idea what is going on, the characters themselves are just as ill informed. Many reviewers seem to see this as a negative however it's refreshing to have a movie where the main character isn't a Scientist/Adviser who is suddenly called up and handed all the facts. It's a story about normal people in extraordinary circumstances trying to reach their loved ones."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Definitely a \"dumped on Netflix\" movie. The premise is simple and the plot is predicable. The lack of resolution and details sinks this film into the low scores its getting.

I like the characters, there was decent acting, but something was missing. The missing something was called and ending. They drive away with a flaming explosion behind them that they seem to outrun. Closing credits. Huh? It was like watching a cook make your favorite meal. The cook lets you take a bite here and there making you excited for the meal to be ready. They put the meal in front of you and your mouth waters. You try to take a bite, you get punched in the face and someone steals your food and throws it out. Basically...it ended abruptly. I shook my head, tossed the remote on the sofa, and turned off the TV. I was left with...WHY? and What happened next?! Sigh."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "So far this is the worse movie I have seen of 2018.  Nothing really happens in the movie and a character dies from a wound they received from a crash that looked like a car hitting a shopping cart.  No body in this movie wears seat belts at all.  I'm not sure if this movie is just a pro-seatbelt ad, but that would make more sense than telling you its a movie.  None of the performances are good and the writing is terrible.  The most annoying character just walks off in the night and out of the movie because they are upset.  It was a very lazy way of getting rid of a character that didn't need to be in the movie.  Seriously don't watch this movie.  Learn from my mistake and save yourself time."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This was a refreshing disaster movie, which got that the essence of disaster movies is NOT about which type of disaster is actually happening (izzit aliens, zombies, da govunmunt or what) but how the people react to the tragedy. It doesn't explain the disaster at all, which therefor remains a mystery. In that, it is like The Road. This is perhaps therefor not a movie for the average empty headed viewers around the multiplex, who like their stories tied up with a neat little bow. But more for intelligent people who aren't threatened by the insecurity the movie's open end leaves you with. Yes, there's no explanation. Deal with it.The acting in the movie is superb from Forest Withaker, decent from Thomas, and very interesting from Grace Dove as Ricky. The whole father-in-law vs son in law conflict was a bit exaggerated and stale, but that's a minor thing. 9 from 10.The Melancholic Alcoholic."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Thickening the ever growing Netflix catalog with more poor quality; How It Ends is a sci-fi thriller, confusing, convoluted and bad.The argument is mediocre as well as the performances.Too frustrating, not advisable."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Well, I rarely dislike movies without proper explanation or put my personal tastes aside in order to give a more objective view. But man, I feel somewhat scammed for my time.First, the movie starts pretty good, albeit a bit too American-stereotypical. Then \"something\" happens and the regular apocalypse setup starts. But after a few minutes, it gets super dull - and that is being repeated several times from then...I sum up the whole middle part: Driving, driving, driving. For some reason the protagonist stop their car for every random person on the side of the now deserted road. Protagonist then get ambushed by said Hillbillies, thy fight for gasoline. Rinse and repeat. I kid you not. Me and my family could nothing but sigh about the fourth time they stop and getting held at gunpoint just for that stupidity of the driver.Then, in the end, all out of all the peope of Seattle, the main protagonists pregnant girlfriend survived, while all the people seem to be dead.

Cinematography is fantastic and Forest Whitaker was phenomenal."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Well it certainly lives up to its name. The whole movie is mostly one long action sequence and it just abruptly ends without really explaining much at all. I get that sometimes you don't need a detailed explanation of the disaster to make an interesting movie, but when the only real point of interest in your movie is that disaster, it leaves the whole thing feeling very hollow. I recommend watching Extinction instead. That is a muuuuch better movie that follows roughly the same pattern."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "The cast does a great job especially Forest Whitaker and the direction is surprisingly solid but its the stories lack of resolution and even depth drags down the movie.

The action is lame.  The story might've been something if it had gone anywhere."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "This movie blends in well with other Netflix movies which are all themed more alternative in termes of narrative, plot and style. It almost seems that Netflix doesn\u2018t even try to produce an average from the shelves cinema movie. Instead this one keeps spinning the story around itself following two guys on a roadtrip like car ride, leading the apocalypse like scenario after questions not being answered and an open, confusing end - not really being an end - bringing up even more questions and - at the same time with nice, kind of premium looking cinematics. I agree that after watching this movie you feel kind of left alone with the ending and not being satisfied, but I wouldn\u2018t call it a bad movie. Coming closer to the end of the movie, some scenes can\u2018t be distinguished wether they have a deeper meaning or just filling up space."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "How it Ends is best described as a disaster among disaster movies. In typical Netflix fashion this is another failed attempt at making a good Sci-Fi movie.From the start interaction between characters feels very awkward. Though the two lead characters were written that way, it is still an overall problem between all the characters. Will, the bloke that took daddy's little girl, is a **** that looks stressed out all the time. Tom, the military daddy, is a very dominant direct guy that clearly is struggling with the fact that Will is such a big **** And that's their entire relationship in a nutshell.When a videocall suddenly ends with the girlfriend not understanding a sound, all contact with the west coast is lost. For some reason GPS and phones don't work either, which implies that all the satellites around the Earth are no longer working... Which is practically impossible... But sure, let's believe that for a moment. Daddy and **** decide to go to Seattle to save the Girlfriend, and along the way they run into more problems than a turkey at a Thanksgiving dinner.Then, half way through the movie the writing suddenly improves a lot. The main characters have a more real touching chemistry, and scenes get more interesting compared to before. This doesn't last long though. It lapses back into shallowness and stupidity straight after that.Turns out that Girlfriend is still alive, and she's staying with a conspiracy theorist who for some reason gets **** boyfriend to act like a real douche. Suddenly it becomes important who believes what instead of the fact that people have died. It's ridiculous.The movie ends with **** boyfriend killing the conspiracy theorist, and then driving away with girlfriend to outrun a volcanic eruption. And then it just ends... Wtf. No questions about what is going on are answered, and the end doesn't feel satisfying.It's a mediocre movie with some enjoyment in the middle, but a lackluster start and finish. I give this movie a 5/10."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "I disliked this movie since the start as they acted lik nothing really disrupting happend.
