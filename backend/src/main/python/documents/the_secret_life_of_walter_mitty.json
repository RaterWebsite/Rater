This might be because thematically it might have struck a personal chord.

I go and watch the movie and i feel like watching it again. Ben Stiller does such an AMAZING job with this. His performance was very believable and he uses his camera in smart angles and views.  I absolutely hope this is nominated for a couple of Academy Awards because he did a great job with it. I highly recommend it."

Don\u2019t let anyone, especially yourself, stop you from seeking adventure and making the best of this precious gift of being alive. It is a fun and heartwarming tale that is worth watching.\r The story and screenplay don\u2019t necessarily excel or surprise in the narrative department, but they provide a emotionally satisfying experience nonetheless. However, this film really shines from a directorial stand point. Ben Stiller does an excellent job of balancing the fantasy and real world moments in the film. I really felt like I was watching a person\u2019s daydreams when Walter would zone out. It\u2019s exciting and beautifully executed and when the character snaps back into reality, it is very much like me when I daydream.\r The cast does a solid job, but nothing really stands out performance wise. Having said that, I find Walter to be an incredibly likeable character. He\u2019s odd and a bit awkward, but he never feels hopeless so we can always root for him when things don\u2019t go as planned. And Ben Stiller\u2019s natural charisma adds to the character\u2019s likability.\r Overall \u201cThe Secret Life of Walter Mitty\u201d is an enjoyable feel good movie that will warm your heart and make you appreciate life. The film doesn\u2019t excel in any one particular area of film making, but it does hit you were it counts. Accompanied by a great soundtrack/score, this is a movie that is worth watching and you\u2019ll come out of it with a new found appreciation for life. I give it 4/5"

The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is much more than one would expect with a strong dose of sensibility from Stiller and a tactic refusal to use comedy as a recovery tool as so many movies do today.\r Stiller shows a wide range of acting chops in Life which, at the end of the day, raise this romantic comedy drama adventure to heights it would otherwise have missed.   One of the better movies of the year and deserving of a much greater Metacritic score than the analytical critics have seen fit to deliver.\r This is a movie you won't regret seeing.  Just be sure to open your eyes and see your way to the end."

Having never done much of note in his life Mitty spends most of his life daydreaming, often about ways to impress co-worker Cheryl (Wiig). When a photograph, needed for Life's final cover, goes missing Mitty sets out on an adventure that takes in Greenland, Iceland and Afghanistan.\r Ben Stiller is unusually restrained in the lead role but puts in a superb performance as the socially awkward Mitty and the supporting cast are equally as well cast. The cinematography is stunning and, whilst the pacing is perhaps a little uneven at times, it rarely detracts from Mitty's feel good journey.\r You'd have to have a heart of stone not to be touched by this movie."

The secret Life of Walter Mitty was clearly a movie that Ben stiller really wanted to make. It is the story of a middle age man who has done nothing with his life, who suddenly has an adventure thrust upon him.  This movie is far from perfect but if you are able to overlook some of the more silly parts of the movie, e.g. a scenes where Walter has an all-out fight with one of the bearded pricks in the movie over a Stretch Armstrong doll then you should be fine."

      "text": "I am very happy for Ben Stiller at the moment. He has finally been daring enough to venture out of the brainless teen comedy zone which he has been stuck in for the past few decades and made a very entertaining movie. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty in my opinion should not be described as a family movie. Not because it isn't fun, because I expect adults will actually prefer it to children. This is probably down to the much more sophisticated type of humor used to get the laughs than in Stillers previous movies (basically the Focker movies). I have to admit the style to the whole film varies in places. For example it goes from being a quite funny and sweet to being downright creepy and forced. If you have seen it already you will understand that I am of course talking about the Benjamin Button scene. However this is not what you would call a major flaw and I found most of it to be harmlessly enjoyable. The funniest moment was undoubtedly how Walter deals with the aggressively unlikable character firing half of the people in Walter's company. Kristen Wiig (who I usually find irritating) singing Space Oddity to inspire Walter to get off his ass, is also a brilliant scene. Not perfect, but satisfying by way of laughs and worth watching. Stiller has finally made an intelligent comedy."

      "text": "More than other films, \"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty\" fractures the audience. Split along the dividing line between cynicism and idealism, one camp finds a sweet treat celebrating the underdog while the other chokes on treacle.\r Armed with a terrific script penned by Steven Conrad, star and Director Ben Stiller proves his mettle in front of and behind the camera. His Mitty is an everyman sacrificing all for family; the flights of fancy an escape from a life lived in quiet desperation. Set upon a quest to find an important film negative, Mitty surpasses fantasy, finds the negative and wins the girl. It's pure hokum, yet surprisingly uplifting. Risking oxymoron, though steeped in fantasy \"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty\" is unerringly real.\r The film also peddles the notion our increasingly wired world, where it's not real unless posted on Facebook, is fallacious and dangerous in that human connection to the world and each other is becoming the fantasy. Think of sightseers sequestered behind iPads and smart phones snapping away in lieu of directly experiencing the marvels before them. Or the story of a man beaten by several others on a subway platform where none of the bystanders stepped up or called 911 but did record the scene on their mobile devices.\r Best expressed by the object of Mitty's search, photographer Sean O'Connell (a fine Sean Penn) is poised to take a spectacular snap of the elusive Snow Leopard, balks and states (paraphrasing), \"Sometimes I don't take it. I just like to be in the moment.\" A concept drowning in contemporary life built on instantaneous gratification. (The difference between the immediacy of digital photography and traditional which requires time, patience and a swim in smelly, carefully prepared chemicals.)\r \"To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, draw closer, to find each other and to feel. That is the purpose of life.\" This cinematic \"Life\" magazine motto - the film's theme - infers the adventurous spirit, curiosity and purposefulness require resuscitation. Absent the phony, wise guy RomCom dialogue used in most of the ilk, \"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,\" quietly celebrates the human spirit like no other film in recent memory. And there is nary a cynical frame in it.\r Kristen Wiig is understated and quite appealing. In an unforgettable scene, Walter fantasizes she takes the stage in Nuuk, Greenland to dedicate a rendition of Bowie's \"Space Oddity\" to him. The ballad rouses Walter to board a helicopter and, hanging on for dear life, continue the quest. Later, while pedaling in hot pursuit of Sean O'Connell, a large flock of birds creates Wiig's likeness. It's an amazing image (as is the cinematography of Iceland and British Columbia).\r Adam Scott's corporate raider is a bit broad and one dimensional. Shirley MacLaine is fine as Edna Mitty; a sweet, pie-baking Mom direct from the cover of \"The Saturday Evening Post.\"\r If fault is to be found it is in overt product placement that is counter to the film's tone. In defense, the Papa Johns tie-in is motivated unlike Fedex trucks prowling streets in many films. But the inclusion of Patton Oswalt as an E-Harmony rep is an unnecessary distraction.\r Not unlike any other romantic comedy, this is a film of standard movie plot points and complications. \"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty\" soars in its heartfelt, assured and gentle execution. Given its definitive slant, your mileage may vary."

      "text": "The best movie I've seen in a long time. It does a fantastic job of having a deep, meaningful message, while not coming off as overly pretentious. Walter Mitty is the most relatable character I've seen in recent films. Through the first act where he imagines what life could be, to the last act, you're rooting for walter the entire way. Besides Catching Fire, this is the best movie in theaters at the moment, and, in my opinion, one of Stiller's best works."

      "text": "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is not a bad movie; however, its faults are quite jarring. Ben Stiller leads the film and he doesn't do a very nice job of it. He does not shine and he doesn't behind the camera as well. Kristen Wiig, Shirley Maclaine, and Patton Oswalt are the bright spots of the film as well as its beautiful cinematography. The ending is quite nice but most event sin the film are nothing spectacular or even good. Walter Mitty doesn't show the effort that apparently was involved. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is 46% of a good movie."

El reparto esta bien desarrollado, una historia original y divertida, y muchas risas sanas para disfrutar en familia. Buena pel\u00edcula."

      "text": "Forget the original short story: This has been hijacked by Ben Stiller's ego (he also directed) into a confused commercial mess. He plays a mild-mannered worker at LIFE magazine, who lapses into heroic daydreams. After a threatening job event and the urging of a woman (Kristen Wiig in her blandest role yet) he's inspired to go on a real adventure that takes him to Greenland and Afghanistan. The plot abounds with illogical moments, heavy-handed characters, loose ends and embarrassing product placement. There's nothing particularly imaginative here, although some of the scenery is pretty. Stiller lacks the acting chops or directing skills to give this silly fantasy any true heart or vision."

The landscapes and the effect was fantastic.\r and I could not stop laughing some times.. So I gave the movie full house, and it's rare that I give a movie full house (10 ratings) It was just a beautiful movie, the songs that were playing gave me goosebumps. And I fell so warm in my heart when watching this movie, there were no people that hated each other. Only positive people, who helped the people who got lost in their journey.\r It is a worth a watch.!"

      "text": "I wanted so much to like this movie as Ben Stiller is one of my favorite actors.  Having said that this is one boring film that is going nowhere from ten minutes into the film.  Danny Kaye makes this Mitty look very bad.  I can't believe that no one stood up to Ben as he was directing to tell him how awful this flick is.  Avoid at all costs."
