First off, a movie such as Date Night  does not possess a goal to make a cerebral and qualitative experience; instead it aims its course to create endless laughs utilizing elements such as slapstick comedy.  This film performs this genre's criterion to perfection, as it ultimately creates a gut-wrenching humorous experience.Date Night's premise is simple, a worn out married couple, Fey and Carell, look for excitement with a night on the town.  They soon realize that this love-renewing night could lead to their murder due to a implausible mix up.  As the audience can realize, the plot of the film is very simple and somewhat weak, but that is not the film's strong point nor is it its \".  What makes this film excel is its actors.  As a fan of both Fey and Carell, I consider them to be comedic geniuses in a way that they can make any plot funny. They do so in this film as they create endless gags that have the audience laughing out of their seats.  There is not much to qualify, the main point is that Fey and Carell make this film work; with their traces of subtle comedy to \"laugh out loud\" ridiculous moments that only a significantly stiff person would not appreciate.Date Night provides the laughs even with its simple premise, and that's all what it should do.  If you are solely looking for an incredibly humorous movie, this film provides for 30 Rock and Office fans alike."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Tina Fey and Steve Carell are a perfect duo of comedy and this is a great sit through.

The second time i watched it I thought it was HILARIOUS!! This was a great performance from two actors that really know each other well and made it the best they could. Certain areas were a little dragging but overall it was very good."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "I am a huge fan of both Tina Fey and Steve Carrell, and had eagerly awaited this film.  I feel Carrell's comic skills are often marginalized, and I believe Fey is simply a genius of comedic writing and performance.  Having said that, I wish I liked this movie more. ________ The story is sufficient in that it keeps the pace of the movie quick and agile, and provides ample opportunities for both comedic absurdities and action thrills.  Carrell and Fey share a chemistry that works comedically.  Most of the movie is amusing, and there are a few genuine \"laugh out loud\" moments.  But overall, the movie has a bit of a generic feel to it., I would recommend it as a light, popcorn movie night rental. ________ Special mentions to Mila Kunis and Best Actor Oscar Nominee, James Franco, as they deliver an entire act's full of hilarity in one inspired scene.  Also to Common and William Fichtner in their respective roles as two of the film's \"heavys.\" >>>> My full cinema profile here: http://bit.ly/MyMovies"}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Date Night is a stupidity movie with randomly unfunny scenes.

So they go into the New York City to this insanely expensive restaurant. The only problem is they don't have a reservation, so what do they do? They take one, of course (cause so many people do that). Anyways they take this reservation only to find out the reservation they took belongs to this debt owing couple.Two thugs come up and take them outside and the story goes on from there. \"Date Night\" delivers hardly any laughs and you would think Carrel and Fey would bring something to the table here. It's really disappointing to see these two comic wonders be stuck in such a flat and poorly written so called \"comedy\".I will say though the one up side to this film are the cameos by all the different actors, it kinda reminds you of all the better films they have been in. James Franco, Mila Kunis, Ray Liotta, Mark Wahlberg and J.b. Smoove almost save the film to it's ultimate demise, but \"Date Night\" is slow paced, boring and extremely predictable, do yourself a favor and pass on this very mediocre movie.Instead go out and rent \"The 40 Year Old Version\" (Carell) or \"Mean Girls\" (Fey) both infinitely better films then this one.CastSteve CarellTina FeyMark WahlbergCommon"}, {"rating": "5", "text": "I've just watched the Date Night trailer, and it is both funny, slick and well made.

Steve Carell is a very funny man."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "The success of \"Date Night\" is directly attributed to the chemistry between Steve Carell and Tina Fey, who despite being A-list stars, could be your neighbors, or the handsome couple you meet at a party. Playing Phil and Claire Foster, the relatively unglamorous NBC headliners of \"The Office\" and \"30 Rock\", respectively, have a middle class air about them, which allows the pair to blend in seamlessly among the other patrons at the family restaurant where their characters listlessly feast on a middle class dinner of potato skins and salmon. Phil is like the second-person narrator in the Talking Heads' track \"Once in a Lifetime\", the David Byrne-written masterwork about how ennui can creep into even the best of marriages. Friday night is \"date night\", and it's the \"same as it ever was\". Later in the film, Phil almost literally says, \"This is not my beautiful wife,\" after Claire flirts with a shirtless Mark Wahlberg, who not only emasculates Phil, but half of North America's males, as well. Too bad this well-oiled comedy team wasn't cast in a more ambitious film along the lines of Albert Brooks' \"Lost in America\", or even Ted Demme's \"The Ref\". They connect with each other, and the audience. Thankfully, the pair's impeccable comic timing and lighthearted temperament help prevent their Kafkaesque situation from becoming too heavy-handed and steeped in testesterone. So often in action-comedies, spectacle(gunplay, car chases, etc...) neutralizes, and ultimately, stamps out comedy(for example: \"Beverly Hills Cop 2\"), because its characters in peril end up acknowledging the danger around them with too much reverence. Except for one overlong car chase scene involving a taxi cab(as if Tony Scott guest-directed a segment for Jim Jarmusch's \"Night on Earth\"), \"Date Night\" never forgets that it's a comedy. Both Carell and Fey strike the right balance of gravity and levity throughout their ordeal, which also staves off the excessive silliness so common in modern comedies, where the narcissistic performer often resorts to schtick. They're scared, but not so scared that their absurdist banter and goofy antics are replaced by kinesis(running, dodging bullets, etc.). In addition, both Carell and Fey(far from being narccisists) generously allow Wahlberg, and especially James Franco and Mila Kunis, get laughs, big laughs. \"Date Night\" is predictable, but harmless infectious fun. Since the two television veterans are so appealing together, however, the moviegoer wishes the Fosters would quit their jobs, buy a winnebago, and drive across America with Steppenwolf cranked all the way to eleven. They could also be the people that David Byrne sings about on the \"Remain in Light\" track \"Once in a Lifetime\"."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Much funnier than I expected and the out takes at the end were hilarious.

The \"lets put in a bunch of famous people, give it a few oscars, and call it funny\", the \"let's just have a bunch of sex thrown into there\", and the \"lets give you the whole plot in 2 minutes and make you watch it for 2 hours\" movies. I'll be honest, this movie did use the power of stardom and sex a little over my taste, but not excessively. Overall, I enjoyed this move. It was the first movie in years that I actually laughed because it was supposed to be funny. Usually, I laugh because movies are so badly made, they're funny. This is how romantic comedys should be. To put this movie in this chatagory would be insulting; it was in a catagory all it's own. Steve and Tina made a relatable, interesting, and laugh your butt off couple who really had the worst luck of all time. It delt with issues married people face every day, but not to the point where it became a melodrama. It was just a laugh your butt off good time. My only critism is the prostitute club toward the end. Yes, Steve and Tina pole dancing made me wanna pee my pants, but it was badly handled. It showed way too much of the prostitues, and not in a comical way. It was in a realistic way that made me wanna vomit. William's weird sex fettish and the ugly prostitues did not add to the film, it lessened it. I have to give props to J.B. Smoove & his performance. He took the cab scene from great to one of the best comedic scenes I have ever seen. Good going, JP! In conclusion, wait until it comes out on dvd and rent it at 12am that day.

All in all, the movie was alright seeing as I had no expectations and no prior glimpse of the plot.
