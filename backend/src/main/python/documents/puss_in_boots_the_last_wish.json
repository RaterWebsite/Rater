      "text": "Puss in Boots is a very good Action Adventure film.  Some negative criticism comes from people who label it a Comedy and in turn to find out it's not bursting at the seams with laughter.  More like the chuckles are spread out little by little throughout the film which I did enjoy. If you do not compare this film directly to the Shrek movies, which bombards you with jokes and such, then I believe you will enjoy this movie more.    Another thing that stems negativity is that people believe there is too much adult humor for a children's movie.  That tells me that there are some people still out there that believe all cartoons are for kids, which is not the case.  Included are underlying mature themes that, I believe, is done tastefully.  Very good movie and highly recommended."

Personally, I found Puss to be a more enjoyable character than Shrek (I was a never a huge fan of the Shrek movies) and the cast is wonderful (especially Banderas). Animation is superb and the 3-D definitely adds to the experience (can't say that too often!). Kids will love it, highly recommended."

First of, the story takes place were Puss becomes a legendary cat before he meets Shrek until later. Puss joins Humptey Dumptey and Kitty Softpaws to find the magic beans from the evil Jack and Jill and they must work each other as a team to get the golden eggs at the top of the clouds more like from the fairy tale of  \"Jack and the Beanstalk.\" Next, we meet the characters from the movie. Antonio Banderas returns the voice as \"Puss in Boots\", Salma Hayek voice as \"Kitty Softpaws\", Zack Galifianakis voice as \"Humptey Alexander Dumptey\", and of course \"Jack & Jill\" was voice by Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris. Those characters are fun to watch and they did pretty well such as Banderas and Hayek since they team up in \"Desperado.\" Most importantly, the animation was wonderful and I saw this movie once again in 3D. It's very beautiful and I can see the background that the 3D could take you anywhere and its done well since the animation brings 3D to see. In my opinion, this movie was fun, swashbuckling, and funny at the same time and this cat was awesome!"

What I mean is that you don't have to see any Shrek movie to understand this film. The creators had done a terrific job developing the character Puss in boots's (his origins, etc). All the other characters were great. Every actor's voice matched perfectly with their character. Of course, we all know Antonio Banderas (as Puss in Boots), but even Zach Galifianakis (as Humpty Dumpty) and Salma Hayek (as Kitty Softpaws) did a wonderful job. The comic moments were cleaver, and they all had the perfect timing (essential in comedy). It also has that Mexican style, with the songs and all that. It funny for me, because in this movie (including Shrek) they make fun of fairy tales. So the creators put all type of stereotypes and representation for each fairy tale character (like Puss in boots is Spanish). This movie didn't lose that sort of '' humor ''. A thing that I founded interesting was, in some scenes, they splited the screens, to show different places at the same time. They made fun of that, which was cool. In general, it's enjoyable movie, worth a watch."

As always with Dreamworks the animation was spot on, and the venues in which this adventures took place were gorgeously rendered and varied as well. Many laughable moments are in store for anyone in the mood for some very subtle humor. Recommended for anyone with a heart for animation, adventure, and of course, cats!"

      "text": "Puss in Boots is another entertaining Dreamworks animated movie. Puss in Boots was what I expected - interesting characters, some great laughs (including the Shrek-like humor for adults only), and an interesting backstory. Unfortunately, no cameos from major Shrek characters. The star of the movie was definitely Banderas's Puss. If you liked the character from previous movies, you will not be disappointed. Salma Hayak as Kitty Softpaws was decent enough although not very memorable in any way. And finally, Zach Galifianakis's Humpty Dumpty will be a polarizing character in my opinion. If you thought Rumpelstiltskin from Shrek Forever After was a tad on the annoying side, I think you'll feel the same way about Humpty Dumpty.. Anyways, the story is good. The integration of former players in nursery rhymes and fairy tales is seamless. And the comedy is standard Shrek-style delivering lots of laughs for children and the occasional adult-only joke. The visuals are stunning. And the music is fantastic. It almost felt like an action-packed spaghetti western with a Latin flavor. I definitely enjoyed myself. I also talked to quite a few people afterwords and the consensus was that the children all loved it and the adults kept using the word \"cute\" in so many different ways to describe their feelings about the movie."

      "text": "Besides being an occasional pleaser for non-fans, \"Puss in Boots\" will definitely entertain followers of the franchise, with the backstory of the titular character being told in a silly, and sometimes breathtaking, adventure. The film retains an annoyingly static amount of interest, sometimes plummeting, and suffers a lack of taste and dignity at other times. Unexpectedly though, there is a strong point in the writing, where there are scenes in the story that give hints to what will happen next without making the predictable boring. The action, travel and fight scenes are a definite treat; the film features top-notch animation of scenery. At the very least, seeing the movie will satisfy people's want to know Puss's story, and that enough makes it watchable and gives the watcher something to remember it by, but of course no one could forget Antonio Banderas's majestic portrayal of Puss. Final score: 78/100"

Alas, we get a **** version of Zorro - voiced by Zorro himself - complete with enough cat jokes and cutaways to milk-sopping to make me a dog-lover for life. Pixar is the unquestioned leader in animation not because of their animation so much as their storytelling ability and their integrity (i.e. not letting a mediocre spin-off tarnish their name). Miss this and go take in \"Toy Story 3\" for the 4th time."

However, the films action and adventure feel and somewhat unpredictable story, at least for me, make it a bit better than Shrek 4.
