With ads like this, the movie has certainly built up a lot of anticipation. But while impressively made, this impassive and cold feature fails, in a spectacular fashion, to deliver the thrills.\r The film, which opens nationwide today, is about an urban legend that has come to life: whenever a mysterious, unlabeled videotape is run, its unlucky viewer gets a phone call just after seeing it. The voice on the other end of the phone says simply, \"Seven days.\" It's how long the viewer has to live \u2014 and the corpse looks like something out of a Francis Bacon daydream.\r When her niece dies after seeing the tape, Rachel (Naomi Watts), a Seattle reporter, decides to investigate the rumors. And that's when \"The Ring\" begins its downward spiral. She watches the freakout videotape, which looks like a director's cut of \"Closer,\" the video that starred the band Nine Inch Nails, complete with suffering animals, a fly crawling across the screen and static-ridden flash cuts. As music-video effluvia goes, this tape is not even as unnerving as the outfits Lenny Kravitz wears to the VH1 fashion awards.\r Much of what follows consists of close-ups of the clues that Rachel, desperate to beat the clock and stay alive, sifts through to solve the mystery. The screen-filling shots of newspaper headlines and photographs chronicling the grisly deaths could be from a different kind of horror movie: \"Night of the Working Dead,\" starring Nancy Drew.\r Initially, Ms. Watts, the versatile star of David Lynch's \"Mulholland Drive,\" does a fine job of communicating Rachel's off-putting toughness. Under the best of circumstances, she scares everyone but her son, Aidan (David Dorfman), and based on the dark circles under his eyes and his solemn, old-man's enunciation, he's got problems of his own. But once it becomes clear that tight-jawed anxiety is surprisingly the only note on her piano, the movie feels numbed. Eventually, the phone calls don't even generate the anxiety of telemarketer hits that come during dinnertime.\r The director, Gore Verbinski, stages the opening with a tribute to \"Scream,\" which itself was a tribute to \"When a Stranger Calls\" \u2014 the first scam thriller in which every single scare was in the movie's trailer. Perhaps the most puzzling thing about \"The Ring\" is that it seems to assume that horror-movie audiences have no memory.\r David Dorfman, with his \"Village of the Damned\" haircut and precocious maturity, seems to have studied at the Haley Joel Osment School of Fine Acting. Though there are a few chilling moments \u2014 one big scene involving a horse on a ferry is spectacular \u2014 everything in \"The Ring\" feels recycled, including the picture's look and tone, which are reminiscent of \"The Blair Witch Project.\" \"Ringu,\" the Japanese original of \"The Ring,\" preceded and probably inspired \"Blair Witch.\" Copies of the director Hideo Nakata's 1997 cult classic have made the underground circuit like the deadly videotape that fills the center of the plot of \"The Ring.\"\r \"Ringu\" felt like an era-defining scare picture: whispers about its imminent remake have been drifting through chat rooms since word of its existence first made it to America. But the real spark came from the \"Closer\" video. And \"Closer,\" the director Mark Romanek's grim, romanticized nightmare, with its well-appointed nihilism \u2014 honey dripped over Bu\u00f1uel \u2014 was the perfect integration of visuals and the morose showmanship of the Nails leader Trent Reznor.\r At least the channeling of \"Ringu\" in \"The Ring\" is reverent. Unfortunately, there are other problems. Mr. Verbinski can assemble a movie like a machine, which worked for the scare comedy '`Mouse Hunt.\" But here, the mechanical assembly simply emphasizes how devoid of feeling the film is. One particular scene is just such a hollow set piece: a mentally handicapped young man pushes himself backward on a carousel while yet another crucial nugget of plot information is delivered. \"The Ring\" is there to be admired instead of to creep you out. There's also much huffing and puffing to add a psychological underpinning to the plot.\r \"The Ring\" also rejects the fear-of-girls stain that covered its original. The cinematographer Bojan Bazelli does tone up the bleary-eyed interiors \u2014 the movie's color scheme is \"Exorcist\" green and rotting-plaster white \u2014 but it doesn't make much difference; rather, it just exaggerates the relentless sameness. The Seattle location must have been chosen for its sunless, drizzly skies; there are so many shots of car windows weeping with rain that theaters should pass out squeegees.\r This seems to be the season for horror movies that are basically teases \u2014 offering a promise of a good scare and then running away before delivering. \"The Ring\" is just one more in that cycle."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "All I gotta say is how is this movie got a pg13 rating and not r that\u2019s all you need to know"}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Oh my.

Unlike a lot of movies, The Ring did not focus solely on sex and violence to sell the plot, nor did it rely on sudden jolts or murderers jumping out at the character in order to scare the audience. Instead, most of the horror came from the expectation of something scary, or from the disturbing nature of what was happening; the famous TV-scene was enough to make me avoid my television for a couple of hours.

There were a few \"gotcha\" shock  moments, but they didn't hit that hard. The strength of the film is it's mood/aura.  I have to knock a few points off though because of some minor plot holes and some things not being explained/fleshed out in a way that would have been proper and satisfying for this movie.I also don't get what it was about the TV scene that stuck with so many people.

The movie holds up fairly well despite that the flickering creepy visuals which on release seemed fresh and original are now very common place in film and television. The tone and the creepy atmosphere are still what the movie does well, its very relieving to watch a horror movie that doesnt rely on violence and gore to get its message out. The acting and characters do their job and the plot holes arent big enough to be too distracting. Overall I would still consider The Ring one of my favourite modern horror movies, still being creepy and intriguing, despite perhaps not standing out of the crowd as much as it once did."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "A great thriller with a great plot, and several scenes with alarms and can best be left to the final scene where Samara is finally seen coming out of television to make just another victim in his gaze.

There are some truly terrifying moments to be found in The Ring, but really, where it succeeds is a non-reliance on those scares. Through a truly creepy atmosphere set by director Gore Verbinski and composer Hans Zimmer, The Ring keeps you on edge without having to terrify you. In this way, The Ring is far more thriller than horror film, rather it is a thriller with horror elements. The way it adds to this with a great mystery/detective component as they try to figure out the backstory to the tape is captivating and truly engaging. I know it is a remake, but it still felt very refreshing in that way. Naomi Watts is great in this one, as are David Dorfman and Brian Cox. There may be scarier horror-type films out there, but not many as well crafted and put together as The Ring. What it lacks in scares, it more than makes up for with great direction, music, acting, and a killer story."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Gore Verbinski made a highly thrilling movie, although there are almost none of the usual shock effects.

It leaves so many questions unanswered at the end of the film that it is frustrating. However, the entire movie keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat wanting to know what will happen next. There are satisfying moments of suspense, tension, thrill, and fear. The film lacks exposition which hurts the main characters like-ability throughout, but despite the writing flaws Watts and Henderson do a decent job. The cinematography is breathtaking for a horror film and the sound mixing is exceptional. I have not indulged in the second of the series yet, but after this strong showing I will absolutely check it out. The Ring is a a few answers away from being a groundbreaking horror hit, and for die hard horror fans is a must see."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This is my favorite hour movie of all time,  I have never seen such an impressive horror movie with jump scares, lost changes, sudden changes, and disturbing imagery. This movie truly leaves you with something to think about in the end."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "To describe The Ring, two adjectives leap to mind: spooky and lame. The former refers to the tone and atmosphere, which are about as good as it gets for a ghost story. The latter refers to the storyline, which is about as poorly constructed as can be imagined \u2013 a sad amalgamation of irritating contrivances and gaping plot holes that defy even a generous attempt to suspend disbelief. And, while I normally appreciate open-ended motion pictures, The Ring takes things too far by leaving about 75% of its questions unanswered. This isn't an artistic choice; it's screenwriting sloppiness, and it results in a profoundly dissatisfying experience.\r I knew the moment I exited The Ring that I didn't like the movie, but the gloomy atmosphere is so seductive that it took me a while to realize why. The problem lies in the storytelling. The Ring is an incoherent mess, and the more you reflect upon it, the less credible it becomes. (Note: I'm using the word \"credible\" within the context of the horror/ghost story genre.) The movie seems to have been slapped together without concern about whether anything makes sense. The twist ending feels like something grafted on, and it left me with a question about which was more absurd \u2013 the revelation discovered by the main character or the manner in which she makes the discovery.\r People who are easily unsettled by ghost stories will be freaked out by The Ring. Director Gore Verbinski has studied the masters and understands exactly what it takes to create the perfect \"boo!\" moment. The loud noise, the sudden movement, the musical stinger \u2013 they're all there, and Verbinski employs them with enough skill to apply the \"gotcha!\" to even the most jaded, veteran horror fanatic a time or two. Unfortunately, that's about all this movie has going for it \u2013 quick, cheap thrills. The Ring is a remake of a Japanese movie that I have not seen. Fans of the original swear by it, which leads me to believe that it must be a lot better than the American version.\r Naomi Watts, making her follow-up to David Lynch's Mulholland Drive, is suitably appealing as Rachel. (Is it just me, or does Watts resemble a blond version of her friend, Nicole Kidman?) Martin Henderson is fine as her ex-boyfriend and investigative partner. And Brian Cox has a chilling cameo. Unfortunately, the other key player, child actor David Dorfman, is a blank slate. He comes across as a knockoff of Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense \u2013 and that's a performance I wasn't terribly excited by in the first place.\r I don't recommend The Ring, but it's the kind of movie that could play well to small groups watching it on TV with all the lights out. At least there's no overload of gore \u2013 Verbinski has elected to go the suspense route. Unfortunately, he has such a weak script that his efforts amount to a not-so-triumphant victory of style over substance."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Fairly decent adaptation of the original one.

The truth is if the movie wasn't so damn good it wouldn't have started such a big trend. That being said its really one of the only ones that adapts it's source material quite successfully. It takes the story of an evil girl whose thrown down a well and haunts a cursed video tape. That if you watch it you get a call and only have 7 days to live. It's truly a nightmarish concept that has an urgency that just works. The original Ringu is superior and a brilliant film that is saturated in Japan's religion and mythology. Director Gore Verbinski (Pirates of the Caribbean) adds a domestic spin to the material that doesn't overdo it and just works. I remember going to see this at a preview show weeks before it came out and people freaked during the finale. In fact one grown man ran out of the theater. It's easy to see why the film was such a word of mouth big hit and deservedly so. From the stylish direction to the star making performance from Naomi Watts (Mulholland Drive) as well as solid work from hunky Martin Henderson (Torque), David Dorfman (Texas Chainsaw Massacre), Amber Tamblyn (Grudge 2) and Brian Cox (X2). Unfortunately it was followed up by an overly mediocre sequel and an awful reboot. Hopefully somewhere down the line they'll be able to continue it all successfully.

Its a movie along the same lines as the Blair Witch Project, whereby people talked about it quite alot and it got hyped up, the story sounded intriguing and so you wanted to watch it and decide for yourself whether it was as good as the hype indicated. I was aware that this movie is an American remake of a popular Asian (I think Japanese) movie, similar to movies such as The Grudge which was also originally an Asian movie which became very popular and America took note of this and chose to try and remake it into a movie to suit Western audiences. I have to say that I'm aware that such movies as these, which are often labelled as being horror movies, don't tend to 'go down' too well with me personally but yet that aforementioned 'curiosity factor' tends to get to me in the end and I'll end up watching these movies anyway as the premise interests me enough to see what its all about, so to speak. I remember being particularly dissapointed with The Blair Witch Project, with its ending making me want to shout 'is that it?!' at the TV screen at the time but I'm happy to say that I feel that this movie was slightly better, although I can't say that I was overly keen on the ending.Unlike The Blair Witch Project, The Ring doesn't entirely rely on your mind conjuring up your own images of 'the boogie man' who you somehow know is there but yet cannot see, in this movie said 'boogie man' is actually a young girl with long black hair, whom you can barely see her face and little is known about her for some time into the movie. However, similar to said other movie, this movie doesn't feature a great amount of action scenes, of true horror material I'd say and I would, to an extent, dispute the label it seems to have been given as being a horror movie, instead I'd say its more a sort of a mix of a psychological thriller and even a partial ghost story. There are definitely scenes that will make some people jump and there is indeed a smattering of moderate violence and unsettling images, mainly in the footage on the infamous tape which is shown in the movie, so I wouldn't say that its not at all scary, although I didn't feel scared personally, it was more...unsettling I think is the word. For example, there is one very brief scene in 'the tape' whereby you can see that somebody's finger is about to be impaled on a nail - lovely(!) unsettling and makes you flinch but not really scary as such. It should probably be said that there are other scenes further into the movie which are more likely to make you jump but its mainly spooky and unsettling rather than being at all gory.I found the movie pretty engrossing, although I found myself surprised by the plot to an exent. The story wasn't quite what I expected, with the emphasis being on Rachel trying to identify and trace the locations that appear on 'the tape' thus hoping to unravel the mystery behind its origins, which does, slowly but surely, happen but in a way its a shame as it becomes more human in a sense (does that make sense?) and there aren't too many real 'shock factor' scenes in the middle of the movie, as the mystery unravels, by that point in the movie its more like a crime thriller than it is a horror movie really and I found myself struggling a bit to fully grasp the plot turns, particularly in the final scene, which is rather gimmicky and I felt was a bit of a let down, although I would say that overall this, to me, was a better movie than The Blair Witch Project, I felt it was more entertaining and engrossing overall but it certainly wasn't without its 'quirks' shall I say. To summarise, I'd say that this isn't the worst movie of its type, certainly that I've seen, yet at the same time it has its issues - its engrossing but a little confusing and a bit slow moving, plot wise, mid way through. Some people would probably be a bit disappointed in the lack of scares roughly, again, mid way through the movie but on the other hand, I never felt compelled to switch it off and I felt like even though it has flaws, its still entertaining and somewhat intriguing somehow.I can't deny that I still found it rather engrossing and I suppose entertaining while watching it and I'm sure people who are perhaps more keen on such movies will find a few scenes that will 'creep them out'. I feel that this isn't the worst movie of its type, though its not for me it probably will be enjoyed more by others, so I suppose I'd cautiously recommend it."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "The Ring is one of my favorite horror movie.

First, the design of the movie is spot on. It's dreary and rainy and everything seems tinted blue, which gives the film an aura of dread and discomfort throughout. This is good though, because it complements the story really well and so it puts you in the right mood for the film. Next, I found the story to actually be really interesting. It follows Naomi Watts as she does some investigating into the inexplicable deaths of some kids (one of whom she knows), and so you find out the twists and turns of the plot just as she does. While it obviously has supernatural elements, it operates in a realm that is plausible, where the characters make intelligent decisions, and where there aren't any cheap scares. You actually care about the main characters and you feel as curious as they do. I also like how, as opposed to the original, there isn't a lot of unexplained exposition. Rather, Watts actually has to SEARCH to put her story together, and added plot elements I think clear the story up and make it more compelling. In terms of scares, it doesn't have many, but that doesn't mean it isn't a scary movie. Again, the scares come from how the film is. It just feels creepy and chilling, and so instead of multiples scares with breaks of comic relief, it's just one long drawn-out scare.

It had like 90% dialogue and 10% scare scene. The scene that did make me frightened was the beginning when a teenage girl gets killed. But the scene that did scare me was when Samara crawled out of the TV. But that's all they got? I was wondering if I got the right version, they say this was the scariest movie ever. But I looked it up, and it is the right version. I felt like this was a complete let down, I wanted to be scared **** However, if this is not as scary as people say it is, is it still bad? Possibly....no. The movie did make sense, the characters are likable, and the scenes are perfect. I will give the movie a little credit. But if you didn't see this movie yet and was thinking the same way I was, to be scared **** I would say go see The Grudge, Mirrors, and Insidious if you want to be scared. But still check this movie out if you like The Sixth Sense, you'll like this movie too."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "It is definitely NOT a good horror film. It is really scary for me, to be honest. But when it comes to the technical aspects, it wasn't as good as those classic horror films. Overall, this is just average.............."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Not that scary.\rJust the last scene, when Samara is coming out of the TV.\rIn conclusion \"The Ring\" is not bad, but there are some moments which didn't make sense at all, and it was not as scary as I expected."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "The Ring feels too lengthy in the solving of the mystery, with not much proper action coming from the girl herself coming out the Telly. It feels a horror story best told by ear, 'you watch a video of this possessed girl and you get a telephone call saying you die 7 days later'. The film as well leaves many plot holes, how did this girl somehow manage to make a video in the first place? Why is it intended to kill whoever watches it 7 days later? Also, did Naomi seriously go into her friend's flat, find his dead body in a chair, then just leave him there and run back to her flat?\rIt's summed up, a fairly average film with too abrupt an ending, I'll admit, it keeps your attention, but otherwise, I went through this film wanting more horror and consistency."}], "recommendations": ["the_conjuring", "it_follows", "insidious_chapter_2", "insidious", "the_grudge", "the_woman_in_black", "scary_stories_to_tell_in_the_dark", "annabelle_creation", "the_conjuring_2", "the_possession", "the_texas_chain_saw_massacre", "sinister_2", "the_descent", "insidious_chapter_3", "annabelle", "vacancy", "dark_skies", "the_boy", "the_babadook", "oculus", "the_grudge_2", "the_witch", "malignant", "the_strangers_prey_at_night", "lights_out"]}
