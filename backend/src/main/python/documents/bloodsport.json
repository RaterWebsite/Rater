      "text": "Bloodsport is a 1988 film starring Jean Claude Van Damme. Anybody who hated Kickboxer should watch Bloodsport instead because the fightscenes are so much better directed and very impressive. An entertaining film all through! Great movie."

      "text": "I loved this movie so much, Although it\u2019s predictable, cheesy, and it feels a bit rushed, the story of the movie felt very cool and overall great, not a cinematic piece of history but a good movie for an afternoon chill party"

If you like the mortal kombat video game you will like this. A legendary martial arts tournament with an unstoppable monster like villain. Think mortal kombat without fatalities. An amazing action movie that defined my childhood. Watched over 10 times and many with my dad; a great father son bonding!"
