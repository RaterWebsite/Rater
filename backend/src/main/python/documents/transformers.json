About 70% of the movie was all about the humans, I mean, come on! Its called transformers, not people. For this I rate it a 7 and not a 9 or 10 which it could have got if showed more interesting content. I also didn't like all of the sexual content. Transformers is a kid thing, so I hate to see it turn into a PG-13 movie. Hopefully Transformers 2 won't be so bad."

However, the film blended action and humour to make a great watch. It actually made me laugh out loud, especially the scene in the fat computer hacker's house. The action was fast and exciting, showing the US military as well as giant frickin robots engaging each other. It was kinda obvious from the start what was going on - the \"sound\" wasn't really mysterious or anything."

This movie shows that he is good for more than just comedy. This does have a descent story but what truly makes this movie enjoyable is the action. Its character development was not perfect but that doesn't mean its bad. It was tolerable it was actually quite easy to bare. Transformations look quite good and safistacated. Infact they were so good that I wanted to rewatch the movie and put it in slow mo just to see those transformations. Its understandable why some people don't like this movie. IF you don't like action than you would hate it. But for those of you who are action fans and you want to see somthing get blown up this movie is a must see."

      "text": "It is not, you should understand, a film for those who seek the solace of art. It is, however, the most straight-up, brain-on-standby, CG-buffed explosion of out-and-out fun the summer has yet delivered. Another of cinema\u2019s great exponents, Alfred Hitchcock, would often despair of certain cinemagoers\u2019 predilection for plot logic. He would ignore the cry of these \u2018Plausibles\u2019 and fiddle his books with rollicking suspense. Michael Bay, too, is no friend of the Plausibles, but his trick is to deafen them with \u2018Bayhem\u2019 (def: blowing **** up at sunset). Even amongst the geek-lore of sci-fi he remains more concerned with laying waste to LA than a redoubtable internal logic.\r It shouldn\u2019t startle you to hear that the plot is ludicrous: a box (varying in size from a city block to a handbag \u2014 nothing in the movie is capable of sitting still) with the power to reconfigure machines into Transformers (at one witty point a drinks dispenser sprouts mechanoid legs and a cannon that fires cans at people) has ended up on Earth. As, currently, have these opposing gangs of super-robots. First stop is a dumb kid whose great-grandfather\u2019s glasses have\rthe imprint of a map of the box\u2019s location... Oh, forget it. Listen, good robots fight bad ones and we get in the way. The end.\r Bay has done himself a real favour casting LaBeouf as the excitable loser about to discover his first car has a big surprise under the hood. He shares the pop-neurotic jabber of a young Woody Allen with Tom Hanks\u2019 steady charisma, a straightforward-looking guy who still shines like a movie star. A smart, natural comedian, he levels the bluntness of this toy story with an ironic bluster. Quite apart from his car growing legs, he\u2019s been fidgety enough about the legs of classmate Mikaela (Megan Fox). Drunkenly lapped up by Bay\u2019s lascivious camera, she still comes with a steel core (it\u2019s not just the cars who\u2019ve got hidden centres): Mikaela\u2019s a whizz with engines, not that boys can get beyond her windshield. In fact, all the girls of the movie come moulded to a geek ideal: stunning and boyishly practical. In one of the overextended subplots we get Australian beauty Rachael Taylor as an NSA computer dweeb cracking the Decepticons\u2019 code.\r The cast is at its best young: the older actors, notably Jon Voight and John Turturro as governmental stooges as slow on the uptake as many a parent might be, hammily herk and jerk as if undergoing their own internal shake-up. The film is least sure when mustering global peril, testing the waters of inference with an attack on an American military base in . The first suspects are the Iranians, and along the way there\u2019s a few spry digs at the Bush administration, but any politicising is swiftly reduced to a potty super-Secret Service known as Sector Seven who\u2019ve got Megatron in a deep freeze inside the Hoover Dam, and the film gets on with its juvenile doctrine of daft punk.\r As the \u2019bots show up for a big showdow in humanville, soldiers spilling about like ants, a nonsense/genius tribute to old monster-movies, it\u2019s all about the Sturm und Drang of pure action. It\u2019s a dream-clatter of robot-on-robot war to drive Craig Charles to drugs. On old Orson\u2019s level \u2014 \u201cbig toys attacking smaller toys\u201d \u2014 it truly delivers.\r It\u2019s a shame, then, that Michael Bay can\u2019t help being Michael\r The script may have rubbery legs, but the action is rock-hard. The surprise is the lightness of touch: treat as a comedy for best results."

      "text": "Remember the first time you saw Jurassic Park? Fourteen years ago, it was unlike anything that\u2019d come before it. Special effects had brought prehistory to life, with warmth and wit bonuses amid the scaly carnage. Fast forward to 2021. Pension for some, kids for others, robots for all. You\u2019ll sit there with your super-sleek cyber-phone, call up an old pal and say, \u201cDo you remember the first time we saw Transformers?\u201d Fourteen years on, it will be remembered as 2007\u2019s jaw-dropper. Special effects have brought your childhood to life, humour and humanity bonuses amid the metallic carnage.\r A marriage of bombast and brain \u2013 director Michael Bay and exec producer Steven Spielberg \u2013 only time will tell how much influence the Beard had over the Bad Boy. An LA street battle, decimation ruling supreme? Pure Bay, as his exhilarating highway chase from The Island is vamped up with office block-sized mechanoids. The family squabbles in the Witwicky home of Sam (Shia LaBeouf), where he hides aliens from his parents? Sheer ET Spielberg. It\u2019s a dichotomy shaping the whole film; one extended vehiclenoid money shot, spliced with a human peril drily summed up by LaBeouf: \u201cI bought a car... turned out to be an alien robot.\u201d\r Plot-wise, just ride with it. Plausibility be damned. The set-up\u2019s brief: \u201cBefore time began there was a cube\u2026 Some wanted it for good, some for evil,\u201d guffs the opening A\u2013Z voiceover of how the Allspark (that life-giving cube, kids) wound up on Earth. The gist? The Autobots (goodies, on their way) must stop the Decepticons (baddies, already here) before they find it. The key to where the said Allspark is was imprinted on a pair of eyeglasses belonging to Archibald Witwicky who \u2013 back in the 1800s \u2013 stumbled upon Megatron (a nasty piece of work). The specs are now on eBay, with Archie\u2019s descendent Sam having decided to hock them to buy a car\u2026\r Robots aside LaBeouf is the star, impressing in two very different double acts. First there\u2019s his sentient car Bumblebee, sent to protect Sam from the Decepticons. It\u2019s the sort of car that plays \u2018Sexual Healing\u2019 when its owner\u2019s looking to pick up the marvellously bendy Mikaela (Megan Fox, the pic\u2019s hot-panted heroine). Touching in, yep, an ET sort-of-way, man and machine build a believable bond\u2026 A bond that LaBeouf\u2019s second sparring partner, Agent Simmons (John Turturro), is eager to break. A member of super-secret agency Sector Seven, Turturro has a ball, spouting increasingly deranged one-liners (\u201cCriminals are hot!\u201d). Taking itself as seriously as any film based on a toy line should, it\u2019s only old favourite Optimus Prime who falls victim to tone, his dull do-gooder struggling next to sidekick Ironhide\u2019s snarl. (\u201cThe parents are irritating. Can we take them out?\u201d)\r For every drop of heart and hilarity, though, there\u2019s a giant metal fist, a mid-air shape-shifting skirmish or the cheer-stoking sequence where Autobots arrive in meteors. This is the stuff of pop legend over 20 years in the making, played out by boys on their bedroom floors. This is Bay\u2019s territory and as special effects go, the robots are as \u201cWhat the\u2026?\u201d as the Jurassic dinos. Flawless. However \u2013 peculiarly for a man whose films invariably clock in at the bum-killing mark \u2013 you\u2019re left wanting more. The best film Bay\u2019s made, it\u2019s also his second shortest. In a summer of sequels full of worlds we know, the brevity of Transformers\u2019 opening scenes leaves little time to settle, turning sidestories such as that of hacker Maggie (Rachael Taylor) into awkward diversions with many drifting off before saying bye-bye.\r But such complaints are piffle in a film blessed with an extraordinary sense of fun. It\u2019s even possible to forgive the godawful sub-Linkin Park theme seemingly tossed together on a PS2 music generator. What\u2019s more \u2013 if you\u2019re looking for it \u2013 there\u2019s Spielbergian redemption at play too, a childlike outlook suggesting an extraterrestrial attack is exactly what the world needs to heal our wounds. As the Decepticons strike, the US blames Iran, North Korea\u2026 But it\u2019s not our war, it\u2019s something bigger. We are, as Prime tells Megatron while hanging off a crumbling building and changing from a lorry, \u201ca young species, much to learn.\u201d We\u2019re primitive folk in need of a unifying event to help us forget our earthly woes. This will do.\r The sense of occasion is undeniable as Bay, Spielberg, Shia and peerless special effects fashion what should be the hit of the summer. The start flitters, but this is a rare film that leaves you itching for more. Roll on the sequels."

She was so boring and uninteresting. Why did bumblebee pee, just why. And megatron only being in like 30 minutes of the movie. But what I liked about the movie was that the action is great. Peter cullun as optimus is still a triumph. The humor is sometimes funny. The autobot and decepicon design are a 10 out of 10. Optimus looks badass as a semi truck with flames. Bumblebee looks cool as a camaro, and the others all got great designs. Overall, it's a movie I enjoyed."

Stunning visuals, brilliant editing, mind-blowing set pieces, say about mister Bay what you will, he has always had an eye for the visual. And this is an absolute plus to all his work, basically. But we can also state that Bay's previous work, with a few exception, was nonetheless fairly disappointing. Transformers went further than just the visual shebang.The movie had a good sense of humor too. It was clear that everyone knew that one can hardly take a few car robots seriously, and so no one didn't. Which is a good thing. It made the movie one hell of a lot funnier. The actor's were cool too. Shia LaBouf is a great lead role, John Turturro, John Voight, Anthony Anders and others had really cool side roles, and they made the movie worthwhile.The only downs were the ridiculousness that often crawled onto the screen, of course fault to the slightly preposterous script. Usually I cringe with issues like these, but aforementioned points somehow made the movie awfully amusing.

So, I waited to get it on DVD and viola! I now have the movie and I was excited when it met my expectations.Michael Bay did really well on his directing and the storyline was well-paced together. The cinematography and casting were great, even Shia Lebeouf and Megan Fox's performances were so good and they make a great screen couple. The Witwicky parents weren't given enough screen time, but I think they did pretty well with their comedic moments. The actors that voiced the autobots and the decepticons turned out to be great and they are just like the ones from the TV shows.The humor was so hilarious, and the best humor part was the pee joke which I really laughed during the movie.The action scenes were very darn good. I think that Michael Bay was a fan of action scenes from the TV show and did very well at shooting them just to make it look real.The CGI effects from the Industrial Light and Magic company was that good and it fits well for the action sequences.The music score was riveting and very cool and it gave some emotion in the whole movie.I am going to point that there aren't any negative things to say about this movie and the 57% rating is a little bit low for my expectations, so I'm going to give this pretty much a higher rating.4.5/5 stars"

Fans will go wild for the robots and action lovers will melt over the dazzling visuals and action scenes. If there is anything wrong with this picture is the fact that it runs a half hour too long and grows rather mindless near the end."

The second: Other old cartoon to appear in the big screen, and the good part is some of the first. The autobots and decepticons are awesome, have much details, and all this explosions, and battles are epic, the characters be good, but some irritant [yes Sam]. The story is really good, not excellent, is good, have some interesting moments. But the rest is normal, any new. Transformers is a good movie, the better of this saga."
