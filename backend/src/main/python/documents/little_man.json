They are chased by the police, and Calvin hides the stone in the purse of the executive Vanessa Edwards, whose husband Darryl Edwards wants to have a baby. Percy convinces Calvin to dress like a baby and be left in front of the Edwards's house to get inside the house and retrieve the diamond. Darryl and Vanessa keep Calvin for the weekend and decide to adopt him, while Walken threatens Darryl to get the stone back.",

Meanwhile, quite pointedly, the filmmaker intergrated an African-American couple in an affluent, nearly all-white community, as a means, perhaps, to show that these people don't notice that their neighbors are indeed black. \"Little Man\" might \"Something New\" in code, or maybe it's the stupid low-brow film everybody says it is."

But really the main flaw is that, at no point in this movie did I laugh, to be honest I didn't even smirk at any point. I cringed, I felt physically sick, but at no point did this film approach anything vaguely resembling humour. And for a comedy not being comic is a real problem."

They have done better, and this is probably their worst, but it still has some pretty funny moments. CGI was always going to be obviously dodgy and while its a clever concept it is indeed quite silly, but still its a funny movie that got laughs out of me. Overall it won't please everyone but will get laughs from the right audiences."

A little man who is trying to steal diamond but then things go wrong when the cops are called and he ditches the diamond into a womans purse causing them to chase after the woman and her husband. Then pretty much the Little man dresses up like a Baby to get the diamond back. Now this flim is pretty funny to me and I enjoyed it. I know many critics and some people don't like it but meh I don't care what they say. This is a great movie."

The performances are the nails in the coffin with even talented actresses like Kerry Washington feel awful to watch. Nothing redeemable here."
