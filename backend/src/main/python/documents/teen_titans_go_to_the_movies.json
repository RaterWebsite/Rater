I love it!"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "E-Value: 9Acting: 9Plot: 9Based on the animated series of the same name, this is the very first Teen Titans movie to have a theatrical release. Technically, this is actually the third movie in general for the Teen Titans because the first two movies, Teen Titans: Trouble in Tokyo and Teen Titans: The Judas Contract, were released as a TV movie for the former and a direct-to-video movie for the latter.Set in the same universe as the animated series, the Teen Titans are regarded as jokes and not being real superheroes by many characters including the Justice League and Deathstroke (Arnett). Since most of the Justice League members such as Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman have their own movies, Robin (Menville) suggest to the team that they should have their own movie as well to prove to everyone that they are not a joke.The team travel to Warner Bros. Studios to find a director who can make them a movie. They find a woman named, Jade Wilson (Bell), who has made many superhero movies. Unfortunately, Jade refuses to make a movie about Teen Titans because they are not real superheroes and no archenemy. To prove Jade wrong about the team not being a superhero, they decide to get Deathstroke to be their archenemy.As much as fans of the original 2003 Teen Titans animated series hated Teen Titans Go!, I can tell you that this movie is totally not bad at all. Although the movie retained the humours and comedy gags from the animated series, it is totally funny than any of the episodes from the series itself. The movie is not afraid to poke fun at themselves including past DC movies.The plot of the movie is good and it even breaks the fourth wall sometimes which can make you laugh so many times. There are also many Easter eggs and references you can notice throughout the movie including a very surprising cameo which I did not expect at all. Once the credits start rolling, stay for a mid-credit scene. Lastly, this movie is a definitely must watch DC movie not just for having a good laugh but to also wait for the release of another DC movie, Aquaman, in December."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "My daughter and I are BIG fans of the show and she LOVED the movie. I thought it was okay. The show is at its best when it's exploring the various personalities of the titans but the movie seems really shallow on that front.

Despite a small message from behind, it still concludes well, but has a disappointing introduction, with an exaggerated delay to start a conflict as a base. In a short time in theaters, they already prove they can do better than on television. 6.2/10"}, {"rating": "2", "text": "\"Teen Titans\" was a great animated series, but \"Teen Titans Go\" is a hyper-frenetic annoyance of a show, colorful as it may be, with a few bright spots including its \"The Night Begins to Shine\" mini-series. So it was with some hope that I watched their first theatrical release, though my hope-watch took only minutes to morph into hate-watch. Why? Because it's just the horrible series extended into a feature length film, ugh. The animation is no different, no new villains, in fact, Slade has a stupid, safe voice in this compared to the original TT series. Also, this is sort of a musical but not in the good NBTS way, more like annoying hyper singing they do sometimes in the series. It was just horrible, just horrible, when will this series just die and return to something darker, more mature?"}, {"rating": "6", "text": "I hate \u2018Teen Titans Go!\u2019 not because they ruined amazing characters and it tried to replace something that is just so much better than it, but because even if you took the characters out of the show and replaced them with original ones, you\u2019d still have a so-so show. And it\u2019s even worse that for most episodes you can just swap out the characters and nothing would change. Anyway, this movie was pretty okay. The animation was good, the voice acting was good but got annoying at times, the writing was surprisingly great, and the story was fairly unique. And I use the word \u2018unique\u2019 loosely since we have seen this kind of story, but not used in this way. Since superhero movie have fairly recently become a hugely popular thing, I\u2019m pretty sure this is the first, if not, one of the first, movies to really mock it, so if anything, it\u2019ll be remembered for that. The real strong suit here is the writing. I found that the writing was very strong in a lot of places, but it also felt like the show at some points. Overall, it was entertaining yet devoid of substance, but that actually works in it\u2019s favor because you wouldn\u2019t except a really funny and clever joke from a movie devoid of substance."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "An excellent finale, maybe still there will be a continuation of the TV series Teen Titans 2003."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Just as bad as the TV Show, and i am not trying to be mean but get me out of this hellhole."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Exceeds with expectations, and better than the animation series, and is also a film that becomes the critique of superheroes from the comic point of view of characters derived from the creation of DC Comics, that is, it is as if your comic characters are versionalized in TV and movies and criticize the genre with a Slapstick style.Supera con expectativas, y cumple mejor que la serie de animaci\u00f3n, y es adem\u00e1s, una pel\u00edcula que se convierte en la cr\u00edtica hacia los superh\u00e9roes desde el punto de vista c\u00f3mico de personajes derivados con propiedad de la creaci\u00f3n de DC Comics, es decir, es como si tus personajes de las historietas se versionalizaran en la TV y el cine y criticaran al g\u00e9nero con un estilo de Slapstick"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Enjoyed it.  My son is a fan and I am a convert - even though my favourite stuff is the more classic style animated series from DC.  But the humour and music are handled very well - and unlike so many of the animated characters nowadays - all of the Titans are willing to be themselves, quite a bit dorky and obsessed - and are not jsut constantly obsessed with looking cool and winning.  DC could use a little more laughter as it refocuses its approach to its film roster.  My fear is that Aquaman the film will be a zillion times more lame than the Aquaman in TTGO.  Lots of laughs - you will enjoy - much funnier than Lego Batman."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Took my kids and was surprised by how much I enjoyed it.

Some of the jokes are ingenious; a lot of stuff adults will like as well as kids. Expect a lot of references and rib-poking at the DC universe and movies.The character designs are simplistic, but colorful. The backgrounds in particular can be quite lively at points.As the funny as the movie is, the plot isn\u2019t as strong. It\u2019s hard to relate with the characters and be invested in their emotional journey. The thing is that the Teen Titans in this are super selfish, destructive dummies. Some of the humor is very black, very funny, but very black. As the film still manages to be funny and fun, I\u2019m sure this won\u2019t be a deal-breaker for many.

Nothing  deep in regards to story, just a typical \u201cpaint by numbers \u201c, cartoon film.    There were a few scenes that had me laughing out loud with my friends, and overall I left the theater feeling entertained.  It\u2019s a nice family movie to take the kids to see, with enough adult jokes for parents to enjoy.  The humor is on the immature side, and personally worked for me.

To The Movies? It was a surprise for sure,because knowing nothing about the source material and everything,I can say that it was\u2026Good...For the most part.I was having a fun time at the movie,and besides the animation (which we'll talk about it later) and a few jokes, nothing really bombed or made me snooze at all.And even if it has the basic structure of a kids flick (guy wants to achieve something SO HARD,but in the end realizes that friendship is what's most important),it's a good letter to how is Hollywood being saturated by endless Superhero Movies and also making fun of them (quoting Deadpool 2 \u201cA Family Movie\u201d,only it's true this time). Surprisingly enough even the music. Not the score,but THE music. The movie tries to take the Disney road by making it a musical several times,and it works really well (and I implore you,listen to Upbeat Inspirational Song About Life (Reprise). It gave me some serious hope about whoever voices Cyborg in this),and don't worry,of course Lil Yachty\u2019s Titans Remix is the king of Corniness.As I said in the IG Story, there's something for everyone. So much so that even the Hardcore DC Fans can go see it and say \u201cOoh,The Atom!\u201d or \u201cWow! Plastic Man!\u201d,all accompanied by the sake of a Stan Lee cameo that feels like it's forced at first and then it's just okay (given another moment of his played for a laugh). That's where we go into the flaws of the movie. The animation was disappointing for 80% of the movie, especially for an Animated Kids Movie,and if you'll say that it's just made for kids,go see that new My Little Pony,because at least in there,they understood that they were making a big-budgeted movie,and so the upped the animation to 11. And yes,there are the normal kids movie poop jokes and they not really bad,but I could've easily done without them (at least there's no dabbing!).Overall,to finish off,Teen Titans GO!

Animation television library and no, Cartoon Network is not involved in the production of Teen Titans Go!. As the only channel of its time to air strictly cartoons (or at least primarily since 2007), their job is to air the show on a basis. The show is infamous for numerous things such as its childish humor and repetitive airing times on Cartoon Network. All of this was literally planned so that it can get a movie of its own. Sadly, it perfectly worked and dominated the movie industry forever. The audience ratings of the show since 2013 was viewed as diverse and biased though I don't care about the show because it served every filler space Cartoon Network had to air its other shows. I would hate to keep on talking about the show because I am supposed to review Teen Titans Go! To the Movies. This film was literally doomed from the start to become The Emoji Movie 2.0 from the people that find this movie completely unnecessary. Thankfully and surprisely, the movie did not become The Emoji Movie 2.0. Sure this movie might still have the cringe level very high compared to The Emoji Movie but at least this movie has humor to make it literally a children's version of Deadpool. Something that the show in its entirety has not achieved. It's not perfect though and it's literally filled of flaws that was carried over from the cartoon that this movie is based on. I find this movie completely unnecessary for the film industry but as far as I am aware that there are Teen Titans Go! fans existing out there, I still think the cartoon did fine enough to make the children constantly watch it on Cartoon Network. At least SpongeBob SquarePants needed a reason for a movie in 2004 since it was served to be the series finale for the show until Nickelodeon kept the show going for its merchandise. There's absolutely no reason why Teen Titans Go! needed a movie but you know what, at least it sorta worked. The show is not actually that awful once you view it as its own. Sure it had awful episodes to go with it, but under the hood, it has good episodes too. This movie is near the superior level of awful episodes and inferior level of good episodes. Children will find this film colorful and amazing to watch but adults, otherwise, will have to find something else to watch. Is this movie worth watching? Let's be real and honest. It isn't, but it's a mess-free film guaranteed if you're up to a few chuckles here and there."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "A surprisingly hilarious and smart parody of superhero films.

To the Movies is actually pretty good tongue-in-cheek play on the superhero genre that somehow managed to make me see the dumb TV show in a different light.As for issues, there are some recycled meta jokes that didn't land well, and some dull moments halfway through. But my biggest issue is pretty much everything about the third act, excluding the last 5 minutes; a misplaced exposition that actually seems that it was just there to fill a plot gap, and infuriatingly clich\u00e9d denouement that has nothing to do with the creativity of the rest of the movie, case in point the clever plot twist that really surprised me.I didn't think I would say that about a movie that I only saw because its decent critical reception, but to be honest I actually want them to make a sequel!(7.5/10)"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "This movie is funny and entertaining, but a little weaker at some scenes.

It\u2019s almost like South Park or It\u2019s Always Sunny In Philadelphia, in a way. As for my thoughts on the movie, it was hilarious with tons of great jokes about superhero movies and the Teen Titans GO! series itself. The animation does look pretty cheap, but it is very colourful and it does introduce different styles for certain scenes which were great to see. Could it get annoying at times? Sure, but it always came back with a genuinely really funny joke so it all evened out. The pace of the comedy is so fast that it doesn\u2019t give the bad jokes any time to land before the next hilarious joke is told. It\u2019s just always on and always moving!
