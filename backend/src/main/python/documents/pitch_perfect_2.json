Quite often, the movie appears to be trying hard to get the audience to laugh, but the jokes falls so flat that there is hardly any response.\r What stands out most is that people in the (Dutch) audience were kind of offended. The frequent \"latina\" jokes had people looking at their friends and partners like \"what the hell\" in quiet discomfort. When the main characters, which are supposed to be educated women, did not know where Copenhagen was I already felt that the movie celebrated ignorance. But when one of the characters during the trip to Denmark asked something like \"It is so dirty and smelly, why do Americans ever leave America\", the European audience was laughing AT the movie.\r Fat amy's self-deprecating fat-jokes were the funniest thing in the movie... and they were not that funny."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Pitch Perfect has become one of my all time favorite movies, so anyone can imagine how hyped I was to witness the greatness of the Barden Bella's as they endured a new year of capella competition in the sequel. However, the film did not exceed or even meet the hype for that matter. The opening scene was absolutely hilarious, but unfortunately it did not set the tone for the rest of the movie. The humor felt forced and the film overall was not engaging. That being said though, the sentimental ending was a nice touch."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "\"Pitch Perfect 2\" \u00e9 um filme OK.

This sequel tries too hard to match the highs of the first movie, and ends up falling flat. There are plenty of jokes, the majority of them unfunny. Some of the comedic sequences are excruciating. Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, and the other actresses who appeared in the first PP seem wasted here. There are some good acapella numbers, \"We Belong\" being a highlight. But the plot device that serves as the impetus for the movie does not make any sense, and is borderline offensive. Rebel Wilson, in an accident while performing, exposes her vagina to a live audience. The audience is horrified, and the Bellas are left in disgrace. This doesn't make any sense. It was an accident, and she showed her vagina, for pete's sake. She didn't murder an infant on stage. To have such a reaction, and to expect the film audience to have the same reaction, to female genitalia is offensive."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "The Movie is generally a cash grab after the first film's success.The movie is boring and not great the only thing i enjoyed are the a capella performance and absolulely nothing else."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "The first film was entertaining for me and my wife.

This is the same director who directed porn and...Movie 43. I don't hate Elizabeth Banks and I don't like to talk crap about her but if I have to be honest she wasn't all that good at directing because when you're a director you got the biggest job and you have to make it work and it doesn't happen here as the jokes fell flat and most of you may say it's the writing but let's not forget that she's looking the screenplay going \"Yeah that's good let's start rolling\". But Elizabeth Banks also stars in this movie and she was funny in the movie, so yeah that's it for Elizabeth Banks...I still don't forgive you for Movie 43.\r The whole cast all do good in the movie because they are all great actress, but the one thing that I thought lacked in the first movie and this is some of the characters and I'm not saying that they horrible, it's just that some of them come off cliche and a bit stereotypes with the humor that did not help at all. You got that fat one who's self ware of herself and always makes jokes about her weight and doesn't know anything, you also got the weird Asian women who dose strange and odd things because well the script says so. I don't blame the actress for this as I think it's the directing and writings fault that this came out flat, but aside for that the whole cast did a fine job and did what they could with what they got.\r Now I going to sound like a old nick picking grumpy man for saying this but I don't like modern music from today, yeah these some good modern music out there but the kind of music that I like is the ones that focus on it's lyrics and doesn't repeat the same line over and over again and doesn't feel lazy, well in this movie they do they Capella to modern songs and the songs that they pick are the songs that I personally don't like as I exampled before about how music should be done right by it's lyrics and the sense of passion and heart put into them.\r The writing as I brought up early in the review wasn't very good. At least in the first movie it had funny elements with the character's and how the movie was self aware of how over the top it was, but in this movie it's more of jokes and less of the funny impact on the character's, the movie did a lot of South American stereotype jokes and I'm here thinking \"Wow this who ever wrote this movie really hates South American, and every time it came out of they mouths I literally rolled my eyes with shame and pain.\r Now I don't hate this movie but judging on this review and I how I brought up a lot of negative things about the movie, but I didn't walk out of the movie feeling a shamed of being human, no I just walked a bit disappointing because I thought the squeal was maybe going to be better just by the little hype I heard from the movie. If you like the movie that's fine, but for me I'm still not a fan."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "It's hard to hate this movie because it does capture at least some of the elements that made the predecessor fantastic. But all the jokes seem kind rehashed from the first movie and you feel kind of a been there and done that feeling. Some jokes are a little forced and the movie seems to rely greatly on jokes and other plots, but the best part about it is the a capella performance. Most of the movie is a bunch of jokes and not all of them are funny because they are rehashed and forced. This makes the movie pretty boring even though the guy from key and peele is pretty funny in this movie. Honestly, the movie wasn't awful, but it seems like this movie was made purely for money. It doesn't serve as a great sequel. It's more like a parody of the original. But this movie had its moments to keep it from being terrible. This saved Pitch Perfect 2 from being one of the worst movies of the year."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "A typical average sequel. They push too hard on what they did well in the first movie, resulting in fat amy,  fun minorities, and freshman-that-saves-the-world all taking up too much space that none of the main characters can be fully developed. I don't see the point of introducing a new protagonist and a new minority character. And I especially hate Adam DeVine who returns for no good reason. I know that a Hispanic character and Adam Devine and Hailee Steinfield and a rap battle scene will benefit the box office, but please! You are making a movie and music, not just making money! If you need money, seriously, just go make another comic franchise."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Unlike the previous film, the sequel puts it's emphasis on 'Fat Amy' which works for most of the film, however there are parts in which Pitch Perfect 2 simply tries to hard. The a capella performances where spot-on and never failed to impress( in my opinion a slight improvement over the first film). You won't find anything out of the ordinary in its story, however the film constantly finds a way of keeping your attention up during its 115 minutes runtime.\r No, it isn't as good as the first film and no, not every joke delivers. But let's be honest, it's still utterly entertaining and hilarious."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "The Movie is anything but average.Everything is just the same as the first film.The jokes are forced out and everything is just not good enough.I enjoyed the first film but the sequel I Didn't actually enjoyed sure my little sister love it but for me it is just a very generic sequel that only works for specific kind of audience."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "An entertaining and fun experience which was better than the original. The cast are solid, with Rebel Wilson carrying the humour and heart of the storyline. The dialogue is hilarious, with some delightfully subtle humour woven throughout, though the plot remains predictable and occasionally twee. As a musical, the soundtrack is fantastic, which is to be expected, and this somewhat makes up for the lack of real tension in the general story arc. Many laughable moments made for a solid sequel which is worth your time. 7.88/10"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "I'm probably in the minority here but I liked Pitch Perfect 2 more than its predecessor.

It had a total lack of character development, tried hard to be \"edgy\" and frequently came across as offensive, and while the story line had potential it just didn't hold up.  I really wanted to like this film, but they lost something after the first film.  Maybe the producers just didn't understand what made the first film amazing?

It was rapid-fire stupid humor with a few small surprises and decent quality music. It's plot was a bit schizophrenic and not as Amy-centric as a lot of the reviewers made it seem, which I was glad to see. It wasn't very Becca-centric either. If anything, it split its time evenly between them and the new girl, Emily and did an okay job with it.\r The only things I would have liked to see were some non-pop songs and perhaps a bit more time spent on them. Otherwise, I can't say I was disappointed.

It's an absolute joy to watch these talented actresses come together once again with some new faces to give incredible musical performances and deliver a seemingly endless stream of jokes.\r The plot of the previous movie didn't deviate too far from the standard coming of age story found in most movies aimed at teenagers outside of being set in college and a focus on A cappella. That isn't so much the case here. Elements are familiar, but touch on some more emotional themes.\r Moments of sisterhood and vulnerability with and between these characters are the backbone of the whole thing. Their fears about moving on, failing, and being away from the family they created all resonate because of how in love we fell with them in the previous film. That love is only strengthened here.\r It's also a very funny movie. Downright hilarious most of the time. Awesome cameos and a wide range of jokes keep the laughs coming, even if it does suffer from the typical comedy sequel flaw of trying to go too big at times. That need to one up itself does lend that all too familiar feeling of trying too hard that sometimes causes it to stumble. However it also leads to some of the film's best and brilliant moments of comedy and heart-warming sweetness. Thanks to talented direction, sharp writing, and a stellar cast this movie succeeds more often than not.\r While the planned third movie might be a bit much, the Bellas' second performance is one worth watching. Time will only tell is the magic can be captured three times in a row, but I'm thankful to say that it was captured at least twice."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I only saw the original on television so cannot fully compare Pitch Perfect 2.

It's much better indeed!"}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Despite the film existing in a ridiculous world of a cappella groups competing for national championships, I found myself constantly relating to Anna Kendrick\u2019s character, Beca, who struggles to find her own voice in the music industry, and the Bellas who stumbles their way to acknowledge the end to college life and the beginning of the real world. Yet the film never fully manages to strike a balance between its silliness and its warmer side. Pitch Perfect 2 is still inconsistently funny and inconsistently original, and Elizabeth Banks\u2019 effort to deliver thematic undertones is so poorly contrived that it blends awkwardly with the film\u2019s absurdity.

The one liners in this movie are stellar and function on surprise and a bit of wit (John Higgins' pre-women's rights movement comments are outrageous and hilarious).  I rather enjoyed it.

The others were basically a spoof version of themselves -  that's saying a lot because Pitch Perfect 2 is a comedy after all.
