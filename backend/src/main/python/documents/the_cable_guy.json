      "text": "In the film, there is a subplot involving the Sam Sweet trial, where Sam Sweet (Ben Stiller) is accused of murdering his twin brother Stan (also Ben Stiller). Although it is not confirmed nor revealed in the film, two scenes in the film hint that The Cable Guy may have killed Stan Sweet and framed Sam. When The Cable Guy is installing Steven's cable, The Cable Guy stumbles upon a newsstory of the trial and comments \"I hope they fry this bastard\". In the 911 scene, the voice on the recording is not Ben Stiller's, but Jim Carrey's. If so, The Cable Guy may have been a fan of Double Trouble (1992), and Sam may had been one of the customers The Cable Guy stalked. When Sam rejected him, The Cable Guy may have shot and killed Stan as revenge, then impersonated Sam's voice when he made the 911 call, framing Sam for the crime. However, this is only a theory"

The Cable Guy walking up to Steven during the evening at his parent's house and telling him to not mess with him. Another shot of The Cable Guy through the eye hole in the door after knocking excessively and yelling \"Cable Guy!\" Additional footage of The Cable Guy calling through the telephone wires trying to call Steven. The Cable Guy holding two beans in his upper lip to make it look like a mustache. The Cable Guy and someone else popping up from behind a couch and surprising Steven, and a very brief slow-motion shot of Steven staring at something off-camera with an uncomfortable face during dinner (presumably The Cable Guy)."

When the cable guy (Jim Carrey) sang \"Somebody To Love,\" I laughed really hard. One thing I couldn't stand about him was his lisp. Also, he just couldn't seem to leave Steven (Matthew Broderick) alone. If my cable guy was like that, I'd get a restraining order. When the cable guy whispered a part of a woman's body when he and Steven's family played \"Password,\" I was really grossed out! In addition, Robin (Leslie Mann) was a very beautiful woman... especially in the clothing she wore when she went out on dates. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"Be careful who you trust. Also, find out if your cable guy is really a cable guy.\" Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this laugh-out-loud, on-the-floor hilarious film to all you Jim Carrey fans who have not seen it."

I recommend you watch this film twice maybe three times before you make you judgement.For me its a cult classic."

A memorable ending, which is rare for comedies. Most comedies involving Kerry operated on the idiocy of what was happening. But The Cable Guy much deeper film that actually talks about serious things in life, just covers up with a smile"

The jokes don't always land and the comedy is by far the weakest aspect of the film. It does however make up for it with it's insanely dark horror elements. It's really good as a horror film.It's kind of a deconstruction of Jim Carrey's classic comedic persona. If we met any person like the characters he plays in real life, they would be pretty scary dudes. It can get very geniunely disturbing."

      "text": "Stiller shouldn't have worried about the viewers, the character gets unchecked, more importantly Carrey isn't directed.The Cable GuyStiller has good intentions. He treats his lead as a comic book hero. Unfortunately, he forgets to craft the world in a fantasy land. Now, the director Ben Stiller intends it to be in contrast to each other, the character and the world that doesn't accept or eyes him. This was his window for the laughs. And that is where even the script cheats him. There is this obsession of grounding these characters in a more pragmatic way. Which creates the ultimate tug of war that leaves the film hanging in the air empty handed.The other issue is how much time is spent upon building up the antics and the moments that drives those antics. A lot of cinematography too is directed towards the punch line of a joke. The scenarios are set separately for them, like waiting for Jim Carrey's reaction or the procedure of working hard on something that is about to be mutilated by someone else, the film thrives for such elements and as a result adds up extra irrelevant ten minutes on screen. So why is this that the film has aged well culturally?First of all, it deals with the social rigmarole that everyone goes through. And something that we all can connect instantly especially the track it follows, not only is it catchy but the film grows how it was promised to be. And center of this affection is led by Carrey's eccentric performance. He embodies the character so gleefully that it is almost as if he has been waiting to play a kooky personality as such his whole life. To be frank, it is a juicy role. Any character would love to play The Cable Guy, he has got a wide range that marginally hovers around being funny and wrong, there is a fine line to walk here."

Something inbetween all that, although I'm not even sure, if Chip, The Cable Guy, is even a human or a superhuman being of some sort. I have no idea what to take away from this movie, should I not trust my cable guy? Should I not trust strangers in general? I don't know, but I'll definitely not go through the effort and find it out. If you're a fan of Jim Carrey then maybe this one will be for you, otherwise I don't really know what to take away from it."
