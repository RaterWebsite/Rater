The decision making by the characters is poor along with the scripting and pacing. I would not recommend paying to see this movie if you want a really good horror movie. It turned into Insidious 2 in the same way."

      "text": "A disappointing follow up to a genuinely good and scary horror movie. The plot itself is fairly decent. It fails to establish the necessary connection between Phoebe Fox's \"Eve\" and the orphan \"Edward\" (Oaklee Pendergast), which ends up being crucial to the whole thing, but for the most part it's solidly written.\r The movie also has some fantastic performances. That being said none of them have the presence of Daniel Radcliffe so it falls kind of short. That's really the issue with the movie as a whole. It's beautifully shot and everybody is on board and giving it their best, but everything just fails to live up to the first movie. It's missing it's predecessors atmosphere and presence. It's living in the shadow of a better movie.\r It's also lacking in it's tension and fright. Even the jump scares that you can't see coming fail to elicit a reaction when they occur. I may not have seen it coming (a rarity nowadays), but it still didn't scare me. There's little horror to speak of. At least not the kind that could scare anybody.\r As a result we are left with a sequel that just feels dull when compared to the original. It would still be pretty darn dull without the first movie having taken place, but it's not hard to think that it might have been less so. It's a well put together horror movie. Just one that isn't as effective as the one that came before it. Even the woman in black herself seems to have lost her bite now that we know her story. She's become a rather dull specter who has little presence in her own movie.\r 5.5/10"

      "text": "The film has decent horror, although severely lacking in originality. It consists of almost entirely borrowed aspects, not only from the prequel, but many other horror movies from last few years. It's a parade of creepy unsettling woman, a troubled child from Omen who dutifully stares blankly and draws eerie picture, and an equally troubled woman who desperately needs redemption. Aside from a couple moments, it gets too predictable which reduces the tension from its great atmosphere.\r Story follows a group of children in refuge from war led by two women, the circumstance forces them to spend their time in a decrypted mansion. In time of war and set in particularly unsettling village, the movie has good desolate ambiance. Cinematography brings a crisp grayish look, often dark and grim. In a few scenes such as the overlook of the bog or lingering fog on cemetery, the shot alone sets a good tone for scare.\r However, the pace offers little in term of thrill. Sequences are heavily constructed in stiff motion, from flashback, founding of old trinkets and silent traumatic boy Edward, who inexplicably sees some unexplained thing. Characters have little range or depth, in exception of Harry Burnstow (Jeremy Irvine). The protagonist Eve Parkins (Phoebe Fox) is strictly one dimensional. She's too fixated on Edward, despite there are other children who also need her. Their relationship isn't relatable and quite honestly the kid isn't that interesting either.\r Her hobbies include splitting from the group and investigating random area by herself. Practically half of the movie is her wandering off, this is not a recommended act when in war, worse if it's something related to unworldly presence. One character stands out amongst the rest, Harry the pilot. Jeremy Irvine does a fine job to portray the role, which isn't that surprising considering his work in War Horse.\r The movie still has a few of genuine scary moments, the rest are instigated by poorly made jump scare and shock value from the blaring sound. This feels cheap as it could've utilized the visual more rather than using comfortable honking. The Woman in Black: Angel of Death is a movie cobbled with old elements in different dressing."

This was more like a B-level horror movie and probably should have been VOD or straight to DVD.\rIn summary, see the original again or see Insidious again - those are great horror movies. This one falls flat at around the 3rd or 4th act. Nothing to see here, move along."

The acting is deep, and emphazing on the half baked plot of the film. Such talent, wasted. The camera angles are brilliant, you don't know where she is hiding, so it's a pee in your pants jumpscare. But the unique ideas are also half baked- the story elements are weak, and broken. Overall, it's an entertaning movie that could have been WAY better and a worthy sequel. But still give it a one time watch, it's not full turd."

Slow and simply without any scares, Hammer seem to have decided to try and make films for 13 year old audiences. Nicely shot (when you can see what's in the scene) and well enough played, \"The Woman in Black 2: Angel of Death\" is dull and slow. The goodwill from the first film (although see the original British TV version for a jaw dropping finish) doesn't allow for such lazy writing and filmmaking. Poor."

I do feel as if this sequal was unnecessary I still found it enjoyable. There were some tension building moments but also me some cheap jumpscares.

      "text": "If you're gonna put the name of a character in the title, it'd be nice if that character was actually in the movie. I'm still not completely sure if this was actually meant to be a sequel to 2012's The Woman in Black, or if the producers just tacked \"The Woman in Black 2\" in front of the original title to make a quick buck. Nevertheless, I'll still treat this film as a sequel, as it does contain the house from the original movie. Angel of Death takes place 40 years after The Woman in Black and is about a woman who starts an orphanage inside the notorious Eel Marsh House, which is said to be haunted by a ghost. If anything, Angel of Death feels like the second act of the original movie, in which Arthur Kipps is lurking around the creepy old house, stretched to 98 minutes. Even scares that were very unsettling and scary in The Woman in Black are reused in the sequel to a much less powerful effect. While there were a few admittedly creepy scenes, they were ruined by unnecessary jump scares. I'd also like to point out that the woman in black never appears in the movie until the last 15 minutes, and she only makes 3 or 4 appearances as cheap jump shocks. I was hoping that at least the time period in which the movie takes place could possibly save this from being a total disaster since it takes place during World War II. It's the perfect opportunity to tell a compelling story about the tragedies of war while also being an effective ghost story, but the war themes are dropped within the first ten minutes. I think the most shocking thing about Angel of Death is the fact that it's a ghost story that lacks both a ghost and a story. If you're looking for a good, moody, atmospheric haunted house movie, then I suggest 2012's The Woman in Black. Skip Angel of Death."

      "text": "The fact that this movie came out in the very beginning of January and now I'm reviewing it, well I tried to escape from January but it followed me...help me.\r The Woman in Black 2: Angel of Death takes place 40 years after the initial haunting of the Eel Marsh House - when WWII threatens, a group of children finds themselves evacuated from London and placed in the house where it doesn't take long for the sinister presence to awaken once more.\r To the people who don't know, I actually liked the first movie..a lot. The fact that the first film had jump scares in it, it still had some creepy and chilling scenes and I remember those more than the jump scares because it was more effective. Now we got the squeal and what a surprise it's got more jump scars and no more of that creepy atmosphere that made the first film watchable, wow horror directors these days have forgotten how to direct horror films.\r Now let's start of with positive things in this movie and yes these actually some good things in the movie, would you believe that: The movie is shot really good as well and the acting in the movie isn't all that bad as I thought. Phoebe Fox did a good performance in this movie, she actually tried in this movie not like some actors or actress out there in these type of horror films that don't give a damn about they movie or they role.\r Now for the bad..get ready: I am just sick and tried of jump scares, I mean they not scary it's just a loud nose that makes us jump because we didn't except it and that's not scary at all. Most of the time it's false jump scares them the freaking kids and after a while the jump scares deflate any attention to the film. F**k Jump Scares.\r The lighting in the movie was hard to see at times, it was like Alien Vs. Predator Requiem were through out the film I couldn't see **** and the Women in Black 2 is the same.\r Overall Woman in Black 2: Angel of Death has some positive things in it with the acting and some of the shots, but the rest completely sucked. There was no need for a squeal, it's just a cash grab squeal that will be forgotten and for good reasons."

The Woman in Black doesn\u2019t earn the gold star for first place, but I would at least give it a bronze medal. Its successor, not so much. Cheap scares and dark corners are all you\u2019re going to find in this film.Set in the time period during WWII, forty years after Daniel Radcliffe\u2019s Arthur Kipps inhabited the house, orphans of the war take refuge in the same house from the first film. The film centers around Eve Parkins, Phoebe Fox, and Jean Hogg, Helen McCrory. The two have taken in children to flee the country during the war. Before boarding the train we get an introduction to Edward, Oaklee Pendergast, an orphan who Eve feels the need to take under her wing. She immediately is protective over him and watches out for him the rest of the film.While on the train to the house which they will turn into an orphanage, we meet a war veteran, Harry, Jeremy Irvine.Arriving at the house, Jean and Eve are stunned at what they\u2019ve been given to take shelter in and turn into an orphanage. The house is old and clearly a safety hazard, but the caretaker assures them that it is the only thing they will find, as it is the only thing available. So, they decide to make the best of it and get the children settled in. Edward seems to be struggling getting along with the other kids, as they pick on him, and Eve starts having weird dreams. Harry shows up at the house, kind of creepy since they just met for the first time on a train ride, and Eve invites him in. They become close.Now, after the first creepy dream and the first kid starts acting weird, you know everything\u2019s about to hit the fan. This movie is no different. Edward becomes \u2018obsessed\u2019 with the Woman, and Eve tries to protect him, obviously putting herself at risk. This movie had a lot to live up to, considering its predecessor, and it didn\u2019t quite hit the mark. There were a few scares that made me jump, however most you could see coming a mile away, the predictable scares in every movie, and there were good parts to the film as well, but overall I wasn\u2019t as impressed as I hoped I would be. I give them credit for sticking to the story line from the first movie for the most part, and the ending is satisfying. It just seemed a little bit rushed, and the characters didn\u2019t stand up as well to Radcliffe\u2019s Arthur Kipps. There wasn\u2019t as much to work with in this film, and The Woman wasn\u2019t as well explained, even though if you watched the first one you know the basics. The ending was kind of predictable, I think I called it about halfway through. That could be because it was an easy guess, or because I just watch so many movies I think I\u2019ve figured out all the twists.If you liked the first movie, this one might not stand up to your expectations. Overall, I know this review is short, but I really just don\u2019t have a ton to say about it. It didn\u2019t stick with me like it should have. Luckily, it\u2019s already out on DVD and Netflix so you don\u2019t technically have to pay to see it."

      "text": "Much weaker than the first film.This film is the sequel to another, which was a success and which, in turn, was the remake of a TV movie of the 80's. This time, the house of the swamp is occupied by a group of children from London , in the middle of World War II, in order to protect themselves from the German bombings. They are accompanied by a small group of adults where Eve fits, a young woman with a mysterious past who soon realizes the horror that inhabits that house. It is up to her to protect the children from the dark entity that wants them dead.Personally, I find this film considerably weaker than the first. The script is very simple and underdeveloped. We never really feel the danger of war, and all the action separates from the context of the time, only managing to take advantage of the environment, the scenarios. The war was only a pretext to fill the haunted house of children, coming from nothing, easy prey of the murderous creature that lives there. The characters were also thought of in the worst way. Too clich\u00e9, we have an aviator traumatized and frustrated with himself, a loving young woman who is pursued by a complicated past and a skeptical elderly, who only believes in supernatural phenomena when they literally jump in front of her face. The scares are basic, the film fails to create a tense and disturbing environment.Technically, the film clearly displays its low budget: all scenarios are basic, with the main house being emptied of all the decadent and exquisite scenery of the first film. Cinematography is overly dark and this makes the film very boring. There are some details of the film that, too, I misunderstood, such as the emptying of the neighboring village to the marsh house. Did they all die? Was it the creature that killed them? Are they gone? What happened?This movie is bad and can not scare you. It's not a movie that I believe you can see more than once."
