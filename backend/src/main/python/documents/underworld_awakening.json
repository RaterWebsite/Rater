I love action, gore, and fast pacing, but this film lacked everything that made Underworld mysterious, subtle, and provoking. I've said it before, and I'll say it again, without Bill Nighy's Victor, the series will continue to slag. Nighy had a presence that improved each film with a sense of mystique. This addition indeed welcomes back Beckinsale, but this whole \"hybrid daughter\" thing is a tired concept. Can't it get a tad more interesting than that? Part of what made the first film so great was it's devotion to old-style vamps and wolves, with a couple contemporary twists to make them fresh. This film is pumped so full with steroids and action that it becomes boring.......as a fan of action, gore, etc, that's a pretty big statement for me."

So I was very happy with (Awakening), I don't understand at all why it got such bad reviews on meta-critic. I saw this with a small group of friends and we all thought it was awesome! I mean it had a ton of great action, Selene(Kate) was bad azzzzz!  and Hott!, as usual. We got to meet some cool new characters. I will admit that we were a group of 5 guys though, and I think guys tend to look more for action than romance and story, for the most part. This 1 may have been lacking a little in story and lot in the romance dept. compared to all the other ones but if your a true fan of the \"Underworld\" series, than I think your going to enjoy this movie anyways. =)"

I needed a xanax when this film was over.  The soundtrack was amazing.  If you're a fan of the other movies in this franchise, as I am, I think you will like this one.  However, this one is not about the storyline as much as it is about Kate Beckinsale and her ilk kicking major butt.  It's loud, gross, bloody, gory, and fun.  And did I mention LOUD?

You take her out and you have nothing, with her in you have everything. Yes, they could have made the movie a bit longer and worked on the script and backstory much better - as well as approach Michael in a much different way: CGI is not the answer.  I don't really care about much because Kate Beckinsale IS the movie, but I hope they have a better script next one. The backstory was great, but the execution could have been much better."

But even though I got the tickets free, I still am pissed off about this movie. The first three movies had a great story, cool characters and a nice Gothic European setting, the forth movie doesn't have anything I just listed. The setting is now futuristic which contrasts from the other three movies completely, the characters are completely flat and unoriginalFor most of the movie takes place with Selene and a little girl who is a hybrid. She adds nothing to the story but instead drags it down and continues to make this bad movie even worse.The only part I really enjoyed was a single action scene with the lycans, nothing else. I had very low expectations for this movie and it still managed to not just disappoint me but piss me off. And don't worry the ending sets the story up for a 5th movie which I will not see.IF YOU ARE AN UNDERWORLD FAN, DON'T EVER SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!"

Lets just get one thing straight though, this was a good Underworld movie, but was it a good movie period? not really, this doesn't mean its not enjoyable. It just merely means that if your going to see this and expect superb acting and a detailed story and all, then this isn't your kind of movie, but if your an Underworld fan, or you love vampire/ werewolf flicks or if you just love an action-packed thrill ride then this movie has your name written all over it.....maybe. Just a warning to Underworld fans, this definitely isn't the best entry, but it was good. Their were a few flaws, such as the entire film seemed rushed, it was mostly just ALOT of action and not a long detailed story. The review I read on screenrant.com put it perfectly in saying this felt like an extended tv episode for an underworld tv series. It was a veryy short installment, but it was still good, just not the best and it definitely could've been alot better and longer. If you like action, see it, if you only like oscar nominees then this is definitely not for you, but if you like Underworld see it but be prepared for potential disappointment, i give Underworld Awakening a 7/10"

No. The details in Selene's character from her skin tight body armor, to her martial art moves, to her \"gunkata\" actions, and \"John Woo\" slow mows, they were all fun for the eyes. The setting plot wasn't as sophisticated as the first and second movie, but I am not complaining here. The story just keeps moving forward in the Underworld universe and in this case the forward plot seemed to push it to the next storyline. No \"ah ha\" moments, but nothing to really sink the entire story universe either. Go see it, you won't get bored."

I have been a die-hard fan of the Underworld movies since they've been released and I knew that this one was probably gonna be judged even harsher than the others. I was right. This is a very solid installment of the series and a pretty good action movie in it's own right. I will admit that the story is far from perfect, but what does one expect from the fourth installment to a genre film like Underworld? The 3D effects also were very nice without overdoing it.

      "text": "Dawdling to cinema, hoping that vampire movies haven't died yet after Twilight abused them, I came across Underworld : Awakening, or more precisely I looked happily at Kate Beckinsale's poster. Underworld franchise isn't always that good, it does provide some form of entertainment of blood loving undead. Sadly this movie isn't forgiving to your eyes, literally. Just to prove no matter how cool your protagonist is, a movie doesn't depend on them alone.Underworld : Awakening is dark, I don't mean the vibe or atmosphere, but the whole movie is seemingly shot with dimmed lights, flickering lights, flashlights and unpaid electricity bill. I understand the need to get the theme gritty, but there is no reason why almost every light source in the movie is flickering. Some of the scenes are off putting due to the lack of clarity while being fast paced and 3D, and it's unfortunate because it has better action sequences that its predecessors. It also hampers the sense of uniqueness on most the settings, the set pieces aren't memorable and desperate for personality.And then there's the bane of 3D, the camera angle. Majority of the scenes are Selene pointing gun or throwing stuffs at the screen, werewolves jumping at the audience, all in so recently cliched \"Ohh, grenades are coming at youuu...\" fashion. I'm so over that **** It should be noted that sequences are better to unfold organically than being tossed at my face. Granted there are few good ones without forced 3D, but they didn't appear after half of the movie.Story is your typical humans versus vampires versus werewolves, if you've seen previous installments, you'd pretty much predict what's going to happen next. It's superficial and the relationships between characters could be portrayed better. Narrative isn't its strong suit, it kind of reminded me of Resident Evil frankly. Dialogues are not bad, with some childish taunts and remarks, not that witty but oddly fit the movie.If you're looking for action, it won't disappoint. This is the bloodiest of the series, honestly it's bordering on unnecessary yet gleefully gory. It has some of the best kills I've seen for a while. The hits, bites and shots have good brutality and creativity as well. It slowly builds up and gets better throughout, but the ending might leave you hanging. That being said, I rather have them add more choreography than CG, it's more fluid that way.Kate Beckinsale is a good choice for main protagonist. She has great physique, slender and also athletic in tightly wrapped black suit. It's quite impressive to see her in action and she also oozes calm confidence in her role. I think the directors made good use of her skinny body and seeming glittering suit to create elegant scene. While it's not a good movie, but at the very least, you can view Kate's lovely lithe body in 3D, that's gotta count for something. 5/10"

Kate Beckinsale is as awesome as ever, its very dark, the fighting is over the top enough to be fantasy but down to earth enough to be brutal, and this one and the rest of the series are most likely the baddest ass vampire/werewolf movies out  there. This one like all the others is just beautifully bloody . And to make things even more awesome; there was an Evanescence song during the credits. People have been relating Underworld to Evanescence for almost a decade and its finally been done officially. Its just awesome. If you hate vampire movies and action movies you will most likely hate this. But if you love a good story and hardcore action you will most likely love it. Critics bash it mainly because there is this unwritten rule that states in order to sound intelligent you must blatantly insult something. I don't buy it. I went to this movie on opening night and didn't want to sleep when I walked out. I find the critics score of this movie to be appallingly fallacious . Trust the user score. Not the critics.

The human race has caught on to these warring factions and, like the annoying white blood cells we are, seek to eradicate both sides leaving us the lone victor. Our dear Selene wakes up only to find the world around her has changed and her darling Michael is absent. She begins her journey to find answers and to try and do what she can...survive. U:A went into a correct direction for the series, yet, does not provide enough story and character development to make it work. The action, as always, is entertaining and delivers a visceral attack to the senses making you smile. Yet, with the absence of strong supporting character Michael (Scott Speedman sat this one out...it is a body double) it is as if Selene (played once again by the wonderful Kate Beckinsale) wonders around with a purpose but a script that provides little to no support of that purpose. With out giving spoilers this can be said, while not the best of the series, it is not the worst.

This movie was a step backwards in every way possible other than Kate Beckinsale's hotness.  I liked the story in the last Underworld movie.  The initial scene where a group of vampires fought with werewolves in a medieval setting was amazing, Awakening never had one of those moments.  Watchable, not much more."

      "text": "As you can see by the score I didn't like this, and maybe that's just because I didn't see the other movies, but I highly doubt it because the movie explained all I needed to know to get into the movie, vampires and lycans are at war, Selene and Michael are in love, and humans have now entered the war. I don't really think I needed to know any of the series deep secrets (like the origins and what not) to get in on it. The action is gory and what the movie focuses on instead of plot, which is obvious because the plot is simple, bland, and somewhat forgettable. Some of the special effects also looked dated in the film. I might watch the other movies in the series to see if they change my opinion of the movie, and if they do I will update my review if I need to, but after watching this the other movies are low on to watch list. If your a fan of the series you'll probably get enjoyment from it, but if your not this most likely wont change your mind. And me being a newcomer, it did little to interest me."

      "text": "Underworld: Awakening is the weakest of the franchise to date. It doesn't delve deeply enough into the series's rich mythos, which is a big disappointment for Underworld aficionados. Other faults include giant plot-holes, eyebrow-arching Aliens xeroxing and  a smattering of new, utterly mundane characters (the human cop... why?) who no-body could care less about. What this installment does provide is a series of descent action scenes. As a big fan of the franchise, Underworld: Awakening ultimately made for fun, compulsive viewing... That said, it's very much a film that should forever be labeled \"For Fans Only\"."

You got it! Or to feast your eyes with more absurd gunfighting Actions? You got it too! Concisely, if you are a true fan of thiz saga, you will not have a problem to watch thiz installment one more time. It is another exact extension from the previous movies. But if you ask me, thiz movie is one of long excruciating experiences I have ever had. I mean please to be frankly honest, in every character of every scene in thiz movie, you may have some feelings about how many times you have ever seen these elements in other movies. They take a little from here and a little from that and then they put it together in one screen. It is a boring copycat. Everything seems so cliche. My Heart is not cold, it is broken. The Duo Directors who are responsible for all of thiz, M\u00c3\u00a5ns M\u00c3\u00a5rlind and Bj\u00c3\u00b6rn Stein. Previously, they are well-known for SHELTER (2010). Beckinsale performance as Selene has two angles and an opposite side. On one side, she looks cool in some time. On the other side, she seems so frail and delicate. Meanwhile, the supporting Casts like: Stephen Rea, Michael Ealy, Theo James and India Eisley give typical mediocre performance. Selene the vampire knight has been fighting the lycans (werewolf) since the first UNDERWORLD (2003), UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION (2006) include one prequel UNDERWORLD: RISE OF THE LYCANS (2009). The mastermind behind thiz saga is Len Wiseman, the real-life husband of Kate Beckinsale. Here is an interesting fact. In 2002, there was another couple had met and now they had become husband and wife as well. They are Milla Jovovich (Actress) and Paul W.S. Anderson (Director). They also made four installments of their own so far. It was called RESIDENT EVIL. I have a bad hunch about thiz franchise itself. There is no doubt. Thiz UNDERWORLD franchise has become a successful gold mine for the filmmakers. They will keep awakening thiz franchise as long as money keeps coming. Making matters worse, the vampires do live long! It is very clear. You do not need the brain when you got the gain.\r Visit My Blog on JONNY\u00e2"
