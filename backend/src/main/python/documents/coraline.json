Visually, there are some beautiful scenes, and besides the unusual animation style it is still captivating, but nowhere nearly as beautiful as some new animated films, such as \"Up\" or \"Wall-E\". Nevertheless, a very nice animated film."

Why anyone would expect this to be a Disneyesque, inane sunshine and lolipops venture for a SMALL child and then complain after the fact is a bit of a mystery. It is INTENDED to be dark and yes, disturbing. The artistry and execution left me at a loss for words after viewing, but perhaps that is because I am just a \"moran\" (sorry Bill C)"

The story was surprisingly awesome in an adventurous way, and how they set up the movie was classic. Even better, the movie was definitely appropriately timed, when the movie was ending, I was getting a little antsy. This movie is a must see to any teenager out there."

      "text": "Neil Gaiman has always been an acquired taste. His visions of twisted reality in all of his works has always been more appealing to me as in book form rather than as a visual entertainment. Coraline is no exception. His foray into children's books with the publication of Coraline was a surprise to many but his quirky story was well written and appealing on paper. On film however, it just seems...well, strange. Not exactly a kid's movie and not exactly a film for adult's either. The skill it took to animate using stop action movement should be appreciated. Some stop motion techniques exhibited in this film were simply astonishing. But technique alone does not make a good film. A great film for film students does not make a great film for the average viewer. Consider the twisted universe of the film's reality and the even more twisted vision of the film's alternate reality. Look at the scenes with the almost nude acrobatic sisters. Listen to the awful vocal music, This is not a film for children. Let your kids read the book instead and let them use their own imagination to fill in the blanks. And a final note: The 3D theatrical version must have been something to watch. DO not fall for the DVD's 3D version. It is simply bad. Using red and green cardboard glasses, the film is colorless, dark, eye-aching awfulness. The producers of the DVD's 3D packaging should be ashamed."

And while it is not a terrible movie, it certainly does not deserve a 79 score. Others have mentioned it, but Dakota Fanning is NOT a good voice actress. The visuals were hit and miss. When Coraline first visits her \"other family\" is close to stunning and kept my attention. Unfortunately from that point on I felt like taking a nap. The scene with the near-nude granny was not at all necessary, and not funny. That's another thing this movie lacked: humor. All in all, this is not the worst movie I've ever seen. Far from the best. Far, FAR from the best."

      "text": "Coraline will Sewprise You from the BeginningI recently watched the movie Coraline made by Laika Entertainment during English class. It was a very entertaining movie but also had an odd fee9ling to it. I\u2019d like to inform you of positive and some negative points to the movie and why you should watch it. Coraline is about a girl who has to move to a new home, called the Pink Palace. She goes exploring outside her new home and meets a new \u2018friend\u2019 named Wybie. He is not aloud to go into the pink palace because his grandmother says it\u2019s \u201cdangerous.\u201d One day while Coraline was exploring her new home, she found a mysterious door. At first it\u2019s locked but she makes her mom find the key to the door. When she opens it up, it\u2019s filled with brick. During the night, when everyone else is sleeping, a mouse lead her to this suspicious door she was so curious in. She opens it up once more but this time there is no brick and it brings her to another dimension. Everything in this universe is considered to be much better than Coraline\u2019s reality. In the normal world her parents avoid her, the mom doesn\u2019t cook dinner, and, they won\u2019t grow a garden. In this opposite universe, everything is more enjoyable. Her other mother and father love Coraline, and spend lots of time with her. Show her amazing shows performed by Bobinsky, and cook amazing dinners. But, is it as great as it seems? Some things I like about this movie is its plot and the voices were very good. There was also lots of things going on in the movie which made it interesting. Some things I didn\u2019t like includes, it\u2019s not age appropriate. The animation made it very dark and mysterious, which could easily scare a 5-7 year old. But, there was many good things about this movie as well. For example, it always kept you at the edge of your seat, and there are many surprises that could be peeking around the corner. Coraline gets to enjoy fancy gardens and nice dinners which is shows a very happy and positive effect on the movie. She gets everything she wants in the world and is offered to stay forever. Overall, Coraline was a entertaining move, but should not be rated PG.The group of people that would like this movie is probably teens and adults. The movie is rated PG but I would only recommend it for the upper elementary kids and older.  I think that because the movie is scary and too mature for young kids. It contains some minor animated nudity. Which, some parents will not find appropriate for their 7 year old children. But, I do understand why it is PG. It is animated and contains dolls and playful young children. But, some things like, the creepy dolls and button eyes could scare younger children more than entertain them. It also contains creepy classical music that could cause chills down your back. It\u2019s a good movie, but I only recommend it for older children, teens, and adults. Scale of 5 Stars: 4 Stars ****"

It was too long and there were some scenes that seemed very unnecessary to the story line. At least what I could find of the story line. Yes, imaginative and very creative, but it lacked an emotional pull. Maybe I'm just not smart enough like some of the other critic's reviews, or maybe I'm like the child who says out loud, \"the emperor has no clothes!\" in spite of what everyone forces themselves to believe.

And the movie did not disappoint.\r The story has an Alice in Wonderland vibe since it involves a young girl ending up in topsy turvy word. It reminds me of Corpse Bride in the designs of the two worlds where the real world is grey and drab while the alternate world is colorful and fantastical. I love the design of the Other Mother's world. It's bright and colorful and everything is made to please Coraline. However, as Coraline starts to resist, everything becomes darker and the Other Mother looks less and less human. And I don't know about anyone else, but the climax scared me to death.\r I also enjoyed the characters. Coraline is a believable kid. She's kooky and weird and has strange taste in fashion. She gets on her parents nerves but she just wants them to to pay attention to her. The parents are also believable. There are times when my parents are so wrapped up in their work that they don't have time for me. They aren't bad people. They're just unbelivably stressed. The Other Mother is freaky as hell. She really seems like the kind of mother we all wish we had. She's funny and loving and gives you whatever you want. Too bad she's doing it so that she can ensnare and kill you. The other characters are mostly hit or miss.\r Fans of the book might not like the changes made, but I think there were for the better. The book lacked detailed descriptions about Coraline's appearance. I really liked the blue hair. It fits her character. I also like the addition of Wybie. While he wasn't a HUGE part of the plot, they made his character relevant. And thank god they didn't make him a love interest.\r I can understand why people wouldn't like it as much. It does have a lot of slow moments, but I liked those scenes because they were used to show us what kind of person Coraline is and about her relationship with her parents and Wybie.\r I'm not sure if it will appeal to Tim Burton fans. It doesn't strike the same balance between macabre, comedy, and whimsy, but it's not trying to be The Nightmare Before Christmas. The only things it has in common with it is stopmotion and director Henry Selick. If you like stopmotion, this is a good movie to see.\r And if you liked this movie, watch Laika's other major stopmotion film, ParaNorman."

He realized the reasons storytelling have been significantly important since the dawn of mankind, and devised, as the Brothers Grimm did, that fairy tales and children's stories had to be haunting and entertaining to be both memorable and timeless. This is a great film depicting the growing sense as a child approaches adolescence that their parents and their world aren't exactly as they seem, and that through their trials and tribulations (the 'rites of passage', if you will) they'll reach the 'happy medium' they need to in order to find true happiness in their lifetimes.\r I definitely hope that all of Gaiman's books and graphic novels are made into movies (I most anticipate the 'Miracleman' graphic novels--both those by him and Alan Moore). Ones so well-written would truly be 'comic book movies' worth watching for me."

She was forced to move away from all her friends and live in the Pink Palace. From there she faces challenges but meets new friends along the way. Laika is the company that produced  this movie. We thought Henry Selick (the director) and Laika did a great job making this movie happen.    \u201cCoraline\u201d took place in the Pink Palace Apartments where she found a magical doorway that leads to an alternative, better world. In the other world she meets improved versions of the people she knows, such as her parents. Everything in that world is how she wants her life to be. This world ended up being pretty dangerous for Coraline. Coraline struggles to find her way and learns to appreciate what she has and not what she wants. We liked the stop motion animation in this movie and appreciate how long it takes to do it. We also liked all the characters such as Coraline, Wybie, Bobinsky, and the Black Cat. One of our favorite scenes in the middle of the movie was about one of the many wonders, the other father\u2019s garden. The beautiful flowers seem to come to life as she walks through the garden. One of our least favorite scenes from the movie is when she had to throw the black cat to escape one of the many dangers. Overall, we all think that this movie is really good. This movie is PG, but we think that a certain age group should watch it. It could be hard for little kids to understand and it will most likely scare them. We recommend ages 10 and up so they will be understand the actual storyline. We also don\u2019t recommend this movie to adults, but it is still good for all age groups. Overall this movie is pretty good but is hard to understand the plot and the message that goes with it."

The movie has many different opinions, but you either hated it or you liked it. I was more in between. \u201cCoraline\u201d is made with clay animation which in my opinion makes the movie a little bit scarier. It also has many scenes in the movie that were a little sketchy and scary. \u201cCoraline\u201d was made by Laika Entertainment, they specialize in clay animation, just like \u201cCoraline.\u201d\tIn present day Oregon, 11 year old Coraline Jones  (Dakota Fanning) moved to the Pink Palace Apartment. She meets her neighbors Wybie, Mr. Bobinsky, and Ms. F and Ms. S. Coraline feels her life is boring because of the lack of attention from her parents. Out of curiousity Coraline stumbles upon a secret door leading to a new dimension. There she meets her other mother (Teri Hatcher). Her other mother gives her anything she could imagine, new clothes, delicious food, and even made a garden out of the shape of her face. Everything seems to be perfect to Coraline until she wants to go back home, but discovers she may not leave her other mother. Coraline finds out the truth about the new dimension. Coraline must figure out a plan to leave. Coraline uses her strategic ways to escape her other mother. The characters in \u201cCoraline\u201d had great stories about them, but their bodies were out of proportion and not realistic. Mr. Bobinsky was 10 feet tall and his skin color was blue. Coraline\u2019s relationship with her parents didn\u2019t develop as well as I would have liked it. In the beginning they barely talked and it doesn\u2019t get resolved until the last ten minutes of the movie. The movie\u2019s clay animation created a creepier vibe than a kid friendly one because when the characters have eyes for buttons it\u2019s not a pleasant thing to see. Even though some parts I did not like, the movie did have some positive elements about it. I like how it taught a lesson in the story, \u201c Be happy with what you have.\u201d The movie had a suspenseful plot leading up to the big climax of the story. I also liked that it was playful at times when Coraline had to go find the eyes of the lost ghosts. This movie is PG, a rating that might not be appropriate to younger children, especially from the ages 5-7. I would recommend parents watch the movie first to find out if your child would like it. The movie was awarded a Golden Globe for best animated movie of the year in 2010, a year after it was released. Overall I thought the movie was great. It was entertaining and suspenseful all at the same time, but I would not watch the movie again.Scale of Stars:3 Stars out of 5"

      "text": "Sweet \u201cCoraline\u201dWe watched \u201cCoraline\u201d recently and thought it deserved a review. \u201cCoraline\u201d was released in 2009 by Laika Entertainment and introduced a surprisingly dark tale told by stop motion. Parents bringing their children along to the movie theater to see \u201cCoraline\u201d had no idea what they were in for. What seemed like a adorable, sugar-sweet movie about a young girl turned out to be a nightmare inducing film. \u201cCoraline\u201d starts out with a family moving into a new home in the Pink Palace Apartments. Viewers will quickly realize that Coraline\u2019s parents (Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman) are not very good listeners. While exploring in and around her new home, Coraline (Dakota Fanning) meets a supporting character named Wybie (Robert Bailey Jr.), who later gives her a doll that bears a striking resemblance to her. When she explores her living room, she discovers a portal hidden in the wallpaper that leads to a \u201cbetter\u201d alternate reality where everyone has buttons for eyes. This is where the plot gets dark. Coraline meets her \u201cother mother\u201d who gives her everything she could ever want. Coraline is convinced she wants to stay forever, but at a cost. Her other mother wants to replace Coraline\u2019s eyes with buttons. After realizing this world is not what it seems, Coraline talks to some supporting characters, like the eccentric Mr. Bobinsky (Ian McShane), and two drama-obsessed ladies. The ladies, Miss Forcible (Dawn French) and Miss Spink (Jennifer Saunders), do perform a rather...interesting dance in the alternate reality that includes both of them nearly nude. Despite that suggestive scene, all these characters come in handy to fix the conflict in the movie. \u201cCoraline\u201d is not as sweet as it seems. That dark plot is meant for older children, but the compelling storyline requires you to pay attentiont to find out what happens. The animation would be perfect if it weren\u2019t for the way the characters were portrayed. Some of them are a bit creepy and could traumatize young minds. We think that the movie wasn\u2019t age appropriate and was given the wrong rating of PG. We believe that \u201cCoraline\u201d should\u2019ve been rated PG-13. For example, children probably wouldn\u2019t enjoy the fact that characters attempt to sew buttons into other characters eyes. However, there were a few lessons to be learned if your child wasn\u2019t running out of the room crying. The animations were one of the movies positives and the characters fit the creepy vibe the movie portrays. This movie does have a creepy vibe to it, so we recommend it to young adults. This movie could scare younger children with its dark nature. We think this movie would better suit 10-14 year olds. Do not show your younger children \u201cCoraline\u201d, unless you want them to wake you up in the middle of the night. Our final rating comes down to the movie not being age appropriate despite the beautiful stop motion and interesting plot line. Be careful what you wish for! Final rating: B-"

      "text": "After previously watching the movie \u201cCoraline\u201d, I\u2019ve decided to let others know how I feel about the movie. Henry Selicks\u2019 \u201cCoraline\u201d, is an interesting,  imaginative and creative movie. While the creepiness of the movie gets to me, it delivers an informational message that not many children will pick up on, but an adult, or 14 year old, could get the message. This movie never seemed to bore me or others at any time keeping all of us entertained or immersed in what's happening.When Coraline moves into Pink Palace apartments, she feels bored and alone because she doesn\u2019t have any friends and her parents are always working. She soon meets a boy about her age named Wybie, and her neighbors Miss. F,  Miss. S, and Mr. Bobinski. Coraline then finds a hidden passageway that leads to an alternate universe where everybody has buttons sewn into their eyes and she gets everything she wants including tons of attention from her \u2018other parents\u2019. She goes there everyday for awhile. One day they tell her that if she wants to, she can live with them forever but only on one HUGE condition. That\u2019s when she realizes that everything\u2019s not as perfect as it seems in the alternate universe and learns to accept what she has outside of the alternate universe even if it\u2019s not everything she wants.    While \u201cCoraline\u201d was an interesting film, it had a few flaws and things I strongly disliked. Firstly, it might be kind of hard to explain the moral of the story to a toddler. Second, the animation was slightly off at times. But there were many perfections about this movie too, such as the creativity in the names. It had good twists, and the animation was okay at times and kind of creepy.  \u201cCoraline\u201d is rated PG with some considerable sinister scenes from beginning to end. The movie is aimed for children to get a lesson across that we should not take anything for granted because it could be much worse. Coraline was planned out and told pretty well with the voices and characters being spot on with how you would expect it to be. To really get a grip on the movie and it\u2019s meaning an older audience would be suggested. I would recommend this movie to anybody 10 or older and ready to sink into a great movie. Coraline showing great morals and a great story makes this movie top-notch and a definite must watch again."
