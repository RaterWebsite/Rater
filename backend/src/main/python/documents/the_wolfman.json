To add a new monster to the cycle they released \"The Wolf Man\" starring Lon Chaney Jr, it was an instant box-office hit and launched Chaney into the Universal monster series by playing the mummy through its 1940 mummy films and the wolf-man in several semi-follow-ups. Nearly seventy years later Universal has released a remake making this the last of the classic monster films to be remade. This is not the first time that Universal has attempted to bring the classic monster cycle into the modern era. Their was the Mummy series (1999-2008) which worked well, but over the films moved away from what made the mummy the mummy. In 2004, their was the film \"Van Helsing\" which attempted to create a tribute to the 1940's monster mashes, but was slow and not as grand as some have said. With all that said we come to the 2010 remake of the Wolf Man and compared to Van Helsing makes the previous film look like a masterpiece of cinema. Without revealing the plot, it seems this film attempted to make a revisionist classic horror film, but failed on so many levels, it's not even funny. The first thing would have to be the acting. Benicio Del Toro, despite being a capable actor suffers from the same problem as Rachel McAdams in \"Sherlock Holmes\" as in his American voice does not fit in with the English countryside surroundings and characters. Despite this he does alright with the role, but seems too monotone in the delivery of his lines. Anthony Hopkins has one of the more troublesome performances in the film. For the first half, he is dull and does not look like he wants to be in the film. For the second half, he changes into the more capable actor that he is, but by this point it was so far into the film that it was too late to make any change. The rest of the cast tries their hardest, but comes off as monotone throughout. This fairly represents the film in general it's just monotone. The plot is straight-forward, the acting is barely passable, the colour palette is dull and uses gray so much in the landscape that it turns the film into an artistic failure. Director Joe Johnston may qualify with this film as the WORST director of the year for his direction is flat and unmoving. The film's main selling point was its ton of bloody gore. Every attack on a person in this film involves mass amounts of blood and guts. It's not too bad and \"gorehounds\" may get a kick out of it, but for a film like this it is not needed and makes the film way too campy. While last year I was a little too easy on \"Land of the Lost\" and \"Year One\" praising them as 10 out of 10 films when they deserved a 7 or 8, \"The Wolf man\" does not get any of that kindness, it is just horrible and qualifies one of the worst remakes in cinematic history. The only saving grace sparing this film from the dreaded Zero is Benicio Del Toro's passable performance as the wolfman.\" this is a very false statement about the movie. The Acting was decent, the gore added to the feel of the movie, which was intended to be a bloodfest with a plot (the plot was O.K., but its a never-ending cycle that will cause the haunting of England Forever). I apologize for quoting a subpar review that begins off-topic, but it needed to be done, for he is a liar. this movie had great kills and an excellent but very short-lived.

The technical aspects like costume design, make-up design and art design is appreciative and finely detailed but lacks better sound department, camera work and choreography for the physical sequences which is essential in such features. The wafer thin script has nothing to offer and instead wastes its time on making it bolder, scarier and horrifying as much as possible which too it adapts a lot from previous installments or remakes of it; there isn't originality or creativity in here. Joe Johnston; the director, needs a lot of work to do especially on executing its vision from paper to screen which is pretty standard. The performance aspect of it is usually saved upon while casting such a huge and promising cast but in here that too is in short for the actors (Benicio Del Toro, Emily Blunt and Anthony Hopkins) aren't given enough range and room to factor in appropriately.

The Wolfman fails in almost every respect, unless you consider being unintentionally hilarious a positive trait.  First off, it's not scary.  Sure, I jumped a couple of times, but I don't consider movies that rely on quiet/loud noise dynamics and things jumping out of the darkness to be truly scary, just annoying.  Second, the story is muddled and doesn't seem to be able to make up its mind on whether it wants to stay true to the original story or do something different.  Third, the special effects are horrendous for a movie that supposedly cost around $150 million to make.  Fourth, and perhaps worst of all, the acting is, across the board, disappointing.  Anthony Hopkins looks like he's waiting for his paycheck to clear, Benicio Del Toro appears to be reading off of cue cards, and although Hugo Weaving appears to be trying, he just not able to overcome a tiresome script.  With the acting credentials of the cast and a blockbuster-sized budget, The Wolfman should have been better than your average horror movie.  Instead, it manages to wallow in the same territory that most dime-a-dozen horror movies occupy, just with a little bit shinier production."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "Avoid this movie.

Its main value may be to fill your time at 2am on a Friday in late October but not much beyond that."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "I found mostly all the Universal Studios monsters pretty damn ridiculous. Although there are considered classics I never really found them interesting to watch. When I heard they were making a remake of it I was actually kind of excited. There are not really a lot of good werewolf movies out there. In my opinion the best one is An American Werewolf in London. I was very sadly disappointed.  I'm really negative towards remakes I rarely agree with them. I say leave the original alone. My ideal of remakes is that there is not really an artistic tone with them. You'll only remake it for money, just trying to milk the cow. When you are filming a remake you need to understand the things that made the original so good. Then you build your film using the foundation that the original used. Now the foundation of the original Wolf Man movies was the fact that Lon Chaney Jr. use just makeup to scare people now that's freaking feat considering the movie was made in 1941 that's some talent. With some simple makeup he was able to scare a lot of moviegoers. I think that's what the problem is in The Wolf Man of this year.  The film begins with Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Torro) a stage actor who gets the news that his brother was killed by a wild animal. He decides to go to help his brother's wife Gwen (Emily Blunt) and his father Sir Talbot (Anthony Hopkins) who is a very strange man and always carries a gun. We learn that Talbot has a dark past with his mother who is dead, that torments him and resents his father. One day trying to investigate what happen at gypsies camp the wild animal attacks and bites Talbot and I'm pretty sure you get the rest of what's going to happen. The movie has a very strong plot and the movie is very well acted. I do want to mention Hugo Weaving who plays a Scotland Yard inspector trying to figure out what's going on with the murders. He does a very good job as well.  The set direction is amazing, the locations are awesome and the cinematography is very good we feel the dread in every corner. The problem with The Wolf Man is the werewolf itself. While the CGI is great it's very excessive and we feel a how you call it a very computer taste in your mouth. The movie feels lifeless and there are so many better horror movies out there with better looking and realistic special effects. If they really want to give homage to the original they should have toned the CGI. As well as the pace is very bad it was really boring and the script lacked scares and actual suspense.  There goes another remake down the drain."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "I fell asleep five times during the first 30 minutes, then woke up when the werewolf attacked, dozed off after that, and turned the entire thing off when the werewolf ended up in a lunatic asylum (!). What an odd twist. The biggest problem with this movie is that the main character is not the least bit likeable. Hence noone cares what happens to him. There are also serious plot holes - like, why would his own father let him murder 6 or 8 people before turning him in ? Doesn't make sense.\rI wonder if there is no procedure in place anymore where they screen these movies to an average audience. Do that, and you will quickly find out what's wrong with this flick."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Absolute crap, from beginning to end a completely predictable piece of drivel, I needed the toilet half way through this film and that was the most enjoyable experience of that wasted 90 minutes"}, {"rating": "3", "text": "In 1941, Universal's monster films was starting to show a wane in popularity.

'The Wolfman' is an gothic, instant horror classic and will be remembered for it's brutality and homage. I say: Go see it! Critics have panned good movies before. Examples are \"An American Werewolf in London\" (a movie which later turned out to be the greatest werewolf movie of all time), \"Blade Runner\" and \"Once Upon A Time in The West\".

The story didn't move along at a real fast pace, but enough where you aren't looking at your watch and wishing something would just happen already. Great atmosphere and eeriness, as you would expect from a period horror film, espeically a werewolf flick. So-so acting for the most part IMO, and very serious. The werewolf looked very cool, although there are times when I wish Hollywood would just do away with the use of CGI, because they never can make the animations look real, like when the werewolf is jumping around from building to building. It just looks fake. Not a spectacular film by any stretch, but certainly watchable and I will probably buy it when it comes out on DVD/BluRay. If cheesy, campy humor splattered with lots of gratuitous gore is what you want in a horror movie, you will be disappointed. But if you want atmosphere, darkness, and still some gore, I think you will find that the Wolfman delivers."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "It might be a little premature for Lawrence(Benicio Del Toro) to be seducing his dead brother's fiance, so blame it on the fog, which looks so romantic over the gray lake, it can't help but put the Shakespearean actor in the right mood to teach Gwen(Emily Blunt) the finer points of rock-skipping. Acting coquettish like any self-respecting Victorian woman in a bustle dress, Gwen flatters the man's cleverness by feigining ignorance on the physics of skipping a stone, a pretense for physical contact, as the wolfman lends a guiding hand to her delivery. While romance enmeshes itself in \"The Wolfman\"(it's a Victorian period piece, after all), the movie doesn't forget that the genre a monster is traditionally affiliated with is horror, so Lawrence does a lot more killing than kissing. Although the sun never shines in \"The Wolfman\", the shadows and fog fail to create an atmosphere of dread, or even a minimum of suspense, despite the unrelenting pall that hangs over everything. But there is blood, not glitter on the monster. All those gratuitous shots of the moon are for the werewolf, not lovers. Unlike that moonbeam Bella, Gwen doesn't love Lawrence past the point of rationality where she'd want to be his wolfwoman. That's how the moviegoer can tell \"The Wolfman\" is more of a guy's movie. It's not \"Twilight\", but the Victorian setting makes this handsomely photographed film seem like a Merchant Ivory production when compared to \"Saw\" and its ilk. That's not a bad thing.

A wonderful atmosphere resulted from this detail. It felt so very much, to me, like a classic Hammer Studio production. I half expected to see Peter Cushing or Christopher Lee make an appearance.

His box office movies as a Director are JUMANJI (1995) and JURASSIC PARK III (2001). The movie starred by Benicio Del Toro, Anthony Hopkins, Emily Blunt, and Hugo Weaving. Although Del Toro acted well in thiz flick, I personally think it is very lamentable to use Del Toro on such a movie. Del Toro as we knew was a discreet Actor in serious drama. What are we really waiting on thiz movie is the transformation scene, when Del Toro becomes a werewolf. Rick Baker make-up already supports well. The plots were on customary level. The twist ending did not too surprising. Maybe we could blame Johnston a little bit, bcoz he has not been a good drama Director. If we see thoroughly there are a lot of nuances are similar to Tim Burton SLEEPY HOLLOW (1999). Despite of SLEEPY HOLLOW was happened to be more attractive in some ways.

It's a shame too they had a great cast led by Del Toro and Hopkins that deserved much better."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "A pretty haunting film but also very boring lots of the time. The script seem rushed and seem to miss making a scene a lot more scary then it could have been."}], "recommendations": ["poltergeist", "wrong_turn", "annabelle", "the_thing", "antlers", "the_omen", "clash_of_the_titans", "the_texas_chainsaw_massacre", "jeepers_creepers_3", "i_am_legend", "the_eye", "van_helsing", "the_last_witch_hunter", "malignant", "the_conjuring_the_devil_made_me_do_it", "the_amityville_horror", "underworld", "insidious_chapter_2", "the_haunting_in_connecticut_2_ghosts_of_georgia", "the_possession", "the_invasion", "the_grudge_2", "into_the_storm", "underworld_evolution", "it_follows"]}
