A great film that gives a beautiful name to indie filmmaking."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "The Beta Test is a psychological thriller of sorts, with the premise of the movie being that a Hollywood agent gets an anonymous note from some alleged woman who wants a casual sexual encounter in a hotel room. He partakes in this and it induces anguish and anxiety. He attempts to uncover who was sending the letters and why and tries to hide the affair from his fiance. The movie is a comedy of manners of sorts similar to American Psycho in that the main character is focused on his appearance and status and possesses an artificial, yuppy-like demeanor. It's also kind of an odd movie as it collapses on its own weight of its premise as it can't adequately explain why the notes were sent out. It turns out they were dispersed by some internet geek in a basement who used an algorithm collecting people's data on social media to instigate the encounter. It made very little sense. It was also never explained what the woman's role was in the hook up, if she was an accomplice to the internet geek or if she was just another recipient. These plot holes brought the movie down a peg, but it was an interesting experience."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Jim Cummings is an interesting actor/writer/director. I've only seen his previous film, The Wolf Of Snow Hollow, thinking it was a take on the werewolf genre, but realizing he was examining the breakdown of his sheriff character more than genre conventions. Cummings has the bland handsomeness of a catalog model, with a smile that is just an inch away from a grimace or grinning skull. He portrays a Hollywood agent who receives an invitation for a sexual rendezvous from an anonymous source. Despite an upcoming wedding to a loving fiance (and more likely because of it), he meets up for the anonymous fling (blindfolds are used). Afterwards, he becomes obsessed with the meeting and who set it up. I love how Cummings will stay on an actor (generally himself) as they talk and get themselves deeper and deeper with every word and physical expression. His character is the embodiment of toxic masculinity and privilege, always on the verge of meltdown. An interesting premise, well acted."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "The Beta Test's subject matter is so exposed that perhaps a few lessons in subtlety wouldn't have gone amiss for its creators.I say this because while the concept is quite evident, the script never makes it clear what it's trying to satirize.It certainly shows its patterns, but it all feels sloppy, and lacking in cohesion, especially at the point where it can't balance the satirical tone with the tension and paranoia in which the plot begins to envelop its lead character once he falls down the rabbit hole.It's not a confusing movie by any stretch of the imagination, but it's incongruous and rather inconsistent."}], "recommendations": ["the_card_counter", "swallow", "k_pax", "the_other_lamb", "ingrid_goes_west", "all_i_see_is_you", "anna", "personal_shopper", "high_life", "the_witches_of_eastwick", "miss_sloane", "greta", "sweat", "secretary", "the_king", "erin_brockovich", "elle", "dark_waters", "the_guilty", "the_pelican_brief", "unforgettable", "falling_down", "enola_holmes_2", "bombshell", "fracture"]}
