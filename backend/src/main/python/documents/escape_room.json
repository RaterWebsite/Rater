Not because I haven't wanted to, it's just been difficult to find one in my area. I know have a center in my mall that offers it and now intend on going to it, especially after seeing this movie. That may sound crazy but solving puzzles and using your mind is a fun experience. Just like this movie. Escape Room was a movie that came out of nowhere. I had no idea about this film until a TV spot appeared during a football game I was watching. I found myself really interested in this film. After an opening that will send us back weeks earlier, we are introduced to almost all of our escapees receiving mysterious puzzles boxes that reveal an address to a building where a exclusive escape room they are being invited to attend. They are all under the impression that this invite was sent to them from people they know. We immediately get bad vibes to this however because of the mysterious greeter asking for their phones not to be used in the room. I was getting \"Belko Experiment\" vibes from this at this point and that is not a bad thing. I liked that movie quite a bit. The building design, at least from the outside and lobby look much like the belko building. The set design of all the escape room is very well done. This film is far from done on the cheap then you would expect. With a budget of just over 9 million dollars, every penny is shown with creativeness of the rooms.The film doesn't feature any big name actors except for Taylor Russell from Netflix \"Lost in Space\" and Deborah Ann Woll from HBO's \"True Blood\". That is not to say we are getting low end actors here though. Every performance is well done. Taylor Russell is a very good actress and carries this film. Each room poses a new problem and none of it seems repetitive. With each new mystery comes new challenges and inattentiveness. I have heard some people complain that this has too much of a \"Saw\" vibe. I disagree. Yes, the struggle to solve a puzzle before death is similar but not in the same way. I am so sick and tired of similarities always being brought up because of this. All movies share in common things with other films. Does that mean that every film should be accused of this? I don't think so. Each room brings intense moments with not knowing which character is going to die or experience bodily harm. This all leads to a interesting final act that I did not anticipate. In fact, Jason Kobasic and I were both feeling like this film could be connected to \"Belko Experiment\" and I would have been OK with that. There is a lot of franchise potential in this but only if that characters that survive this film are brought back into it. I am tired of sequels to these kind of movies that just bring in new people every film and ignore the previous characters or just kill them off. The ending did frustrate me at first up until I read an article with the film's director saying that sequels want to get made if the box office is good. Well, I am happy to report that the film has already made 64 million dollars worldwide. Be ready people, another trip to the escape room is coming and I am ready for it.Grade: B+"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Generally, I liked this movie. I don't think that it fits into the category of Horror, but I can agree with thriller. Some of its aspects reminded me of Cube and other movies.

The cast is mostly grating and extremely annoying especially the guy that plays Jason. At least have a couple actors that don\u2019t seem like complete rookies so we can attempt to care about them although the awful script could be to blame for that aspect. The visuals are decently solid throughout and there are a few clever settings and devices. The sequel set up is so blatantly desperate at the end though I will definitely not be watching it.

The dialogue may be a pit predictable at times, however the acting makes up for it along with the complexity and diversity of the puzzles and/or their rooms. There are indeed several spots that can be predicted throughout the movie, however the twists were very enjoyable. Overall, the movie is quite fun to watch because of the way it handles its characters and development. The ending is a bit rough, but it only proves that this is a movie that requires you to think. If you have spare time this weekend, go watch it! Escape Room is a thrill that tends to focus more on its story rather than throwing gore at your face every 5 seconds. Basically, the movie is solid all around; however, the roles of the actors are kind of clich\u00e9, and it can get confusing. The movie definitely could have improved if there wasn't so much being left out; like \"Birdbox,\" it could have used more structure in the plot.

Sure, yeah killer traps and rooms have already been done in previous films, but I appreciate the idea of an escape room in general being used as a force of murder considering how popular they are these days. I wasn't sure how this film would turn out based on the previews, but I was pleased with the final product.Yeah, the movie has some predictable characters and elements, but this is a very polished film. The script, occasional joke without sabotaging the mood, characters, and general direction are all solid. Great main cast all around, better than expected for movies of this type.A lot of thought goes into the murder rooms, which are all impressively decorated and designed. They are a little over-the-top, but the film manages to explain how  they work practically. The challenges and threats all pan out nicely. The ending, while I wouldn't say it was bad, wasn't ideal for me. To clarify, I'm talking about the wrap-up after the final fight for survival, which works. 1) This final part breaks the tenuous suspension-of-disbelief as the antagonist or antagonists does/do something that seems impossible to pull off even with his/her/their resources. 2) There is a semi-long tacked-on setup for a possible sequel that seems more at home for a big blockbuster than a horror film.Also, be forewarned that the reveal of the human face/faces to the antagonist/antagonists is a little underwhelming.I wouldn't say Escape Room is a must-see, but I do recommend it to any horror fan who wants a good time."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Sure, none of the multiple endings were entirely amazing, but if you're an escape room person, like I am, you'll have fun with this!

Like hostel, cube, saw and other such thrillers, it keeps you on the edge of your seat till the end."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "I went into this excited about the premise, but left disappointed by the execution. Make no mistake, the focal point of this movie isn't about cool rooms, interesting puzzles, or challenging clues to overcome - it's about the motivations of 6 of the most unlikable characters you may ever see in a film. It suffers from 'little kid trying to be an adult'-syndrome similar to how when a 12-year-old learns something is edgy they do it CONSTANTLY to seem like an adult to the point of doing it to an immature degree. The movie wants you to know that it's mature and that the stakes are high not through the traps that threaten to painfully injure or kill, but through the characters who fire off so many F-bombs, S-bombs, MFers, etc.throughout the entire film that it probably averages over 4 per minute. It's like being on early Xbox Call of Duty teamspeak with a 12-year-old. It added nothing to the movie and made me lose respect for the script writers.I told you that the main cast of 6 is very unlikable, but some are clearly worse than others. Because of the traps/inherent danger of the puzzles there are some deaths in the cast.  A big problem is the most tolerable characters are the first to go, while the super annoying characters remain til the very end - leaving you with maximum suffering. Combine this with some really culturally out-of-touch moments like when they refer to a \"Games Master\" (ANYONE knows that the correct term is Gamemaster with no 'S', etc.)The movie begins with the worst trope in the entire world - a scene from later in the movie, and then flashes back to \"6 months earlier\" or whatever and the chronological progression begins. The problem is this removes a TON of possible suspense and excitement from a genre LITERALLY called suspense - it's the whole point of movies like this. You now know that this character you saw in the scene will be safe until you are caught up in the plot to that point again. There is no concern over them being at risk from the danger elements, they have an invincible shield constantly. It removes so much possible excitement and in exchange we get NOTHING for it.For a movie focused on the characters and their motivations they seemed to go extremely lazy on this aspect. A super successful businessman with a private office, multiple homes, and luxurious gifts would not be enticed to play some novelty game with strangers just for $10,000. A character that is too shy to even look up or respond when another character says \"hello\" to them, 30 minutes later is shouting **** at people and performing martial arts levels of combat out of nowhere. The shyness was not an act, the character has no previous combat training, etc. It's all just very unbelievable.I do want to say something good about it though - some of the puzzles and rooms were very interesting or had creative traps. Most likely the entire movie budget went to visual/special effects and that part is well done so they are often quite imposing to behold.My final complaint is the unrealistic representation of races in this movie. The driven, successful, measured, intelligent businessman and the hyper intelligent genius-level prodigy scholar are both black - when in real life blacks have the lowest average IQ of all of the races by far. It's made even worse when you factor in the male/female IQ differences and the fact they made a black female the most intelligent character in the entire film (she's also on the poster art so it shouldn't be too much of a surprise) is just a step too far to suspend belief. The white characters, while having the highest average IQ of the races in real life, are represented by a jittery failure of a pothead, a backwater redneck who doesn't even know what an escape room is, and a military vet that is severely and constantly crippled by anxiety (this last one is a bit realistic so I'll let it slide.) I really enjoyed the Indian kid and wish we had more time with him as a character. He had both positive and negative stereotypes which fleshed him out a lot more than the Mary Sue black girl who can do no wrong."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "About 10 minutes into the movie I was looking for a clue on how to escape the theater.
