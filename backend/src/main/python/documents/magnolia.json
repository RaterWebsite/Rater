Now multiply the pretentious factor by 10, and maybe you can come close to imagining the nature of this film. A royal waste of time. If I had paid to have watched this movie in the theatres, I would have without a doubt demanded PAYMENT for the THREE HOURS of attention I gave to this movie. I truly did not expect this from the same director which graced us with There Will Be Blood. If you enjoy absurdism, this is the movie for you. This movie tries SO hard to be some kind of metaphorical master piece, but falls flat on its face, and the beauty of it all is that you can essentially see the exact point at which this movie drops to its knees and begs for the title of 'artistic masterpiece'- it's at the point where the members of the cast, all in different locations, have a sing-along. But what really drove home the pointless nature of this movie was a scene near the end when a certain amphibian begins raining from the sky. I wish I could say I was not being literal in my description, but I am. I highly dissuade one from viewing this movie, and to instead waste their time banging rocks together, because at least the latter will not cause a brain hemorrhage."

When it comes to manipulate multiple characters and make them dance like puppets and bring out the best from each and every situation, no one can hardly touch Paul Thomas Anderson, for his awareness of its eerie world, concept and characters is what makes it work all the way through. Magnolia offers a rare experience that cinema and art could still bedazzle us by its thought provoking aspects toward life and humanity. It is carried and depicted by so many great performances by Tom Cruise, Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Philip Hoffman and John C. Riley pitching each and every words on screen majestically. Magnolia contains fast paced exhilarating script which is supported thoroughly by stellar performances, breathtaking background score and perfect execution."

      "text": "'Magnolia' is perhaps the most polarising of Paul Thomas Anderson's work. A lot of people have found it thought-provoking, emotionally impacting and dazzling in many ways, while many others have found it dull, self-indulgent, bloated and overlong.This reviewer falls into the former camp. 'Magnolia' perhaps feels indulgently overlong in places, and the final group musical number does feel contrived and out of sorts with the rest of the film. On the whole though 'Magnolia' is a dark, daring and dazzling film, and another winner in a filmography where this reviewer has yet to watch a dud.All of Anderson's films are visually stunning, and 'Magnolia' has some of the most haunting and scintillating arresting images of any of his films, especially at the end. The long takes and tracking shots are distinctively Anderson and look wonderful, the whole film is beautifully shot, very atmospherically lit and the production design is suitably audacious. The soundtrack is rich in emotion and sticks in the head, and all the song choices are well chosen. Some found it intrusive, not to me.Regarding the script, it contains some of the most thought-provoking, layered and poignant writing of all Anderson's films. The story has a long length to work with, and doesn't disappoint with the pacing which is a mix of suitably manic and suitably languid when either extreme is needed, unpredictable, beautifully developed, hugely entertaining, dark and often very emotional scenarios and richly layered characters, remarkable for so much going on. Anderson's direction is also exemplary.Another controversial asset of 'Magnolia' is the ending, something that many will find powerful (again fall into this camp) and others will be perplexed. Whatever extreme you find yourselves, it certainly is not an ending that one forgets easily. Anderson's mastery of direction of actors and their interactions shows through loud and clear, with the whole cast giving superb performances in one-of-a-kind roles, for some among their best.Tom Cruise in particular has an absolute ball, and he is particularly well supported by a gleefully entertaining and charming John C. Reilly, a touchingly restrained William H. Macy, an as always exemplary Philip Seymour Hoffmann and a heartfelt Julianne Moore. Jason Robards and Melora Walters also do brilliantly.In conclusion, dark, daring and dazzling. The most polarising of Anderson's films but incredibly well executed, a flawed masterpiece somewhat. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

If you enjoy a lot of actor abuse, verbal abuse (even professional child abuse) you could somehow like this movie. If you've ever wondered what a movie might be like that's written and directed by a self-confessed cocaine user, under-aged pornography addict, as well as being, Quote; \u201cmy favourite filmmaker copycat\u201d - then this could be getting close to realising your dream (perhaps this might also sadly sum up Hollywood today and some audiences) Have tried to sit this through several times (only because of the cast and the hugely conflicting reviews!) but each time was left wanting to throw something at the screen or run screaming from the room. 'Over-everything' is one description that readily comes to mind but, other unprintable ones are first and foremost. Many others have neatly summed-up this tosh very well but few can ever do it the justice it deserves. Writer/director P.T. Anderson can\u2019t even write a single paragraph that's not filled with vulgar language or unnecessary four-letter words and 90% of his characters are not worth caring for.Maybe this could be another example of the modern Academies short-sightedness spotlighting one of the reasons why so many patrons stopped going to the movies around this time, also why many movies of this ilk don't deliver the good returns expected. If your life is so uneventful that you can throw away over three (yes 3) laborious hours of visual splendour being wasted on a theme so repugnantly ugly - then you're welcome to this excruciatingly heavy-handed overindulgence. The movie plays out like several movies in one, with none of them much good or making much sense when edited together - mild interest soon gives way to boredom. As for the director\u2019s favourite singer being played endlessly in the background, this just becomes another annoyance. When a moviemaker publicly makes a statement like: \"I'll make pretty good movies the rest of my life but I guess Magnolia is, for better or worse, the best movie I'll ever make\". Then please let me say: Stay out of our lives P.T. Anderson - way out.  But of course, those either on the payroll or who consider themselves as knowing better than most will disagree."

Paul Thomas Anderson's ambitious and challenging film (in some ways it's more daring than Boogie Nights) juggles an enormous cast of characters who are all in desperate need of love and redemption, and sometimes both.  The film digs deep emotionally into the souls of its characters and suggests that each and every one of them is deserving of these very qualities despite their sins and transgressions.   Magnolia is an art film that begs to be attacked for its pretentiousness and for a gonzo finale, but it's all the better for those very things."

Immediately after viewing this film I knew that it would be on my mind for weeks and that it would become one of my top 10 films. Every character in this movie is interesting on multiple levels. Every scene in this movie is thoughtful and poignant. The scenes that opponents of this film  have problems with, the frogs and the musical interlude, work for me in every way. Both these scenes do seem out of place in this story, but for me that is what makes them amazing. They come from nowhere, but interlock these characters in a visceral, interesting way. There is so much to unravel in a film this large, with multiple plot lines and characters running both separate from each other and together at various times. You could probably write a book trying to accurately review this movie. I look forward to watching this movie again and again over the years, and trying to unravel all the characters and premises in my mind."

      "text": "Who would guess that a film like this would be successful? However, it absolutely is. Magnolia explores the themes of loneliness, regret, forgiveness, the past, and parent-child relationships, with snapshots of the life of a group of broken and troubled people who are all linked, even if they do not know it. Thanks to great acting from the ensemble cast featuring Tom Cruise, Melinda Dillon, Jeremy Blackman, Philip Baker Hall, Philip Seymour Hoffman, William H. Macy, Julianne Moore, John C. Reilly, Jason Robards, and Melora Walters, Magnolia's diverse (yet not as diverse as you may think) are brought to life brilliantly. It also does not hurt that the writing is superb and the depth we go to with these characters in just three hours is amazing. On that note, this one comes in at three hours and in spite of it, it feels like it was nothing more than an hour and a half, as the runtime just flies by. The ending is incredibly odd, though it brings the biblical references and the freak happenings of this one to conclusion nicely, as odd as it may truly be. Overall, Magnolia is a beautiful and brilliantly made film that will move and entertain you."

The most interesting part of the film was the first 1 minute when 3 coincidences were summarized - the only coincidence involving the actual characters in the movie were the boredom in which they inflicted, the pointlessness of their stories and the over-the-top acting by all of the cast members. By the end of the movie, I was praying that they all would die together, quickly because I cared nothing for any of them and only wanted to stop my pain. It will be tough to top this one as the worst ever, but I'm sure some Hollywood genius is already hard at work."

The fates of all the characters are tied together so beautifully and so elegantly by PTA that I think it's safe to say that he is nothing less than a master, one of the greatest artists of his generation. Despite \"Magnolia's\" brutal length, I didn't look at my watch a single time, much because of its soundtrack that gives the movie an admirable pace  both Aimee Mann's songs and the composition by Jon Brion is magical.

      "text": "Paul Thomas Anderson knows how to write interesting characters. \"Magnolia\" centers around the different stories of multiple people. We have two characters dying of cancer. One is a cop that falls in love with a drug addict. Tom Cruise is a sex mentor. The list goes on. As a result I love this movie. Grant it, it's not a perfect movie and has its issues. But we'll get to that later. To be fair, there is a lot to love about this movie. Anderson wrote and directed the living crap out of this movie. He has such a beautiful vision not just from a cinematic scope, but from a storytelling point of view. And he has also written tons of interesting characters. John C Reily as the cop. Jason Robards and Phillip Baker Hall as the two men dying of cancer. Phillip Seymour Hoffman as Robards nurse. TOM CRUISE AS A SEX MENTOR! There are tons of more characters than that, but can't talk about them all day. However the performances from the cast is stellar. They hold their own emotional weight to their specific stories and carry the film. Sure some were better than others, but all their stories were nevertheless engaging. And Tom Cruise just kills it in this movie. In a movie filled with literally top notch performances, he stands out as my favorite character. It was just something totally different from what we've seen him do before. I loved how the stories are interconnected but never to the point that they have to try to have everyone come across everyone in some forced way or fashion. It's not like those ensemble movies in which everyone meets up at the end. For a 3 hour long movie, it keeps me engaged the whole way through. If anything only the last 5 maybe 10 minutes dragged. That's it! Plus it also has a rewatchability factor to it. Again, it goes back to having all the interesting characters keep you engaged the entire movie. Ive seen this movie twice and still plan on watching it a third time in the near future. As far as issues, I will say that Julianne Moore's character was the one that I could never care about. It's the fault of Anderson's writing rather Moore's performance is completely over the top. Luckily she doesn't have as big of a story as essentially every other character. But I could never get into to her character like I did with everyone else. And there is a big event near the end of the movie, while a great scene, it just felt completely over the top and absurd. Maybe because that the whole movie felt so grounded in reality up until that point. I guess it's just something I have to look further into. But overall, it's such an entertaining movie with stunning performances by almost everyone, fantastic writing and a great vision (for the most part) by Anderson. I'm going to give \"Magnolia\" an A-!"

The climactic scenes are masterfully executed by P T Anderson, and give the perfect balance between satisfactory ending and a provocative one.

Stories that are harmoniously told, and embellished with Aimee Mann's heavenly soundtrack. The result is a three-hour epic mosaic devoid of any moment of boredom.I think Donnie Smith's story, William H. Macy's character, is the most profound and the richest one. Nevertheless, it's also the most poorly told one, comparing it to the others. It could have been explored more. I wish I was as invested in it as I respected it after it ended.Also, the movie could have been less on exposition in terms of characters a little bit more. Because I think what I've seen from the fantastic acting and the masterful use of symbolism are more than enough to make everything clear.That being said, these issues are almost indiscernible, and it was difficult for me to notice them.Magnolia is not my favorite PTA film, but hands down it's the most entertaining one despite its long runtime.(9/10)"

A beautiful, bold and downright astonishing exploration of a group of realistic and convoluted characters with so many interlocking themes, similarities and events you could fill a book. Incredible acting, an ingenious and entrancing ending sequence, praiseworthy direction, a wonderful script and original songs by the terrific Aimee Mann all bolster this into a hypnotic masterpiece. One thing I will say, though, is that you need to watch this film when you have 3 free hours and nothing on your mind. Let it suck you in... if you are not paying attention, or if you are overthinking, you will hate it."
