      "text": "The second was awful, so why not close in misery with the third one?To sell a romantic comedy you need charm, fun, and above all interesting or at least entertaining characters, not just a bland overload of cheap sweetening.But obviously that's not what consumers are looking for, and I call them consumers because that's what they are.And I say this, because it was them who made the inconsequential original film successful, and that's how we got this dumb trilogy.But thankfully it's the end. That's the silver lining."

If you are looking for the classic happily ever after straight line then you'll probably hate it.I give it a complete 5 star because i can totally relate with the feeling here. Yes Elle and Noah said they would fight for each other, but i guess fighting for another person may mean letting them go and hope that fate brings you back again when the time is right. I love how much Noah is better able to contain his anger especially with Marco.I must admit i really was happy that Elle got to do her own thing cos common!! She really had been trying to make everyone but herself happy!! If She had gone to Boston with Noah, I think She would have come to regret it in a way and believe me, Lee would never have let her forget it, and If She went to Berkley, She would have missed Noah too much, caused more Drama thereby killing her friendship with Lee.I especially loved that they met after 6 years (Even though they all still looked exactly the same to me) and you can just tell that they would get back together and i especially used my imagination to get the happily ever after my romantic heart was secretly looking for.It was a bitter sweet film for me, a perfect way to end a series that held me from the start.P. S All the other sub plots were cool also, Elle's Dad, Chole's parents etc..all just showed that Life happens and you either go with the flow, fight against it or Learn its curves and bends and just Surf with it!"

      "text": "Honestly this movie wasn\u2019t downright awful, but it surely wasn\u2019t good. It honestly had a waste of a plot\u2026 almost a hyped up repeat of the second installment. The acting is okay\u2026it can seem fake sometimes when the actors hype it up WAY too much. But that\u2019s a problem with the whole trilogy. There should have been a better ending. For example, the time jump should have included more\u2026. like at least establishing Elle and Noah do end up together. We definitely deserved a better ending to this trilogy then what we got."
