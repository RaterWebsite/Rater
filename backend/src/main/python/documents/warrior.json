Yes, it goes a little overboard with the extreme close-ups, and the scenes involving Nolte over the last half hour of the film could have been reworked, but Hardy & Edgerton are fantastic.  I'm amazed that the fighting looks as real as it does - the days of the \"Rocky\" pulled punches which look mega-fake are over.  No, you don't see everything, but you don't get lost in the closeness of the action.  Yes, the movie is a touch long, but it's absolutely worth seeing.  I'm a little mystified that it didn't do better than $5mil on opening weekend."

I saw te good reviews on here and from working at my local regal theater and seeing everyone come out of this movie pleased and raving about how good it was, i figured hey, why not. So i just saw it and wow! Was i blown away. I loved this movie, it started off a little slow but dont get me wrong, every scene played a big part in the overrall feel of the movie. Their was so much drama and heart packed into this film. You must go see this. You will love it. I wanted to cry, and i wanted to cheer, their were so many different emotions in thks one movie. Dont shy away from the long running time, it is so worth it, its one of those movies where you hate it because of the way you feel for the characters but then you love it at the same time. This is the best movie of september hands down, doesnt matter what else is coming out, Warrior is here now and it is damn good. On another note im really glad to see Tom Hardy fit for his role as Bane in Christopher Nolans final entry into his highly successful Batman trilogy. Anyways, Tom Hardy was excellemt, Joel Edgerton was excellent, and not familiar with the actor of the fathers name is but he did an academy award nodded performance. I will be upset if this movie doesn't get any Oscar nominations, it deserves ateast one. Go see this movie, you'll love it....and hate it, haha. Definitely 10/10 stars for sure."

First half is character/story development, with great performances by Nick Nolte and others; second half is pure gripping your theater seat armrests!  Haven't enjoyed a movie like this since the first Rocky!  Women, go see this with your men!  The story is awesome and heart wrenching (in addition to the fighting).

It goes by faster than you think, but surrounded with Beethoven's \"Ode to Joy\". This film had some great character development, but it was a little hard to catch why the two brothers are mad at each other in the first place. That should of been stressed more throughout the film."

Let me tell you, I was so shocked how great this movie was. It has the genres usual clich\u00c3\u00a9s but the movie used them so well and to its advantage that it felt fresh. Sure it's predictable in the end, but sometimes, in this case, it's not about the destination(the ending), it's the journey to get to the destination. Even though this movie was 2 hours and 20 minutes it felt like 20 minutes, pretty fast journey I know, and that's a shame because I never wanted this movie to end. The characters are so great and well-developed that I felt for them throughout the movie, I cared about them, I felt their pain, and the amazing performances from the cast helped contribute to that. Especially Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton, and Nick Nolte who give outstanding performances. I will be so shocked if not one of them are nominated. Everything else about this movie is just fantastic and hell I even cried twice during the last act of the movie. The action was gripping, the script was great, it was nicely shot especially during the fighting scenes, which I must warn you the camera does get a bit shaky but it's for a reason at least, and the score was just great it really added that extra dept to the scenes. I am not a big sports movie fan but I loved this movie, so even if you don't like sports movie I can guarantee that most of you will love."

Tom Hardy's Tommy is just outstanding, the level of intensity showcased is unbelievably scary. Joel Edgerton's Brendan who is trying to make ends meet as a school teacher moonlights as a fighter in parking lots after hours to provide for his family and Nick Nolte's heart-breaking performance as the willing-to-do-anything-to-make-it-right-again estranged father of his two distant sons. And that barely scratched the surface of their story, the depth of the characters is amazingly rich. The first half of the movie builds the foundation for the brothers, their present lives, their rough childhood and their own motivations to get back in the cage, it's as exciting and entertaining as the fighting scenes itself. There's about 4-5 climaxes in Warrior it's outstanding. Unlike a lot of sports/boxing movies we've seen you feel the high-octane scenes. You're really immersed in the fighting sequences, you feel every punch, every kick, every takedown and every headlock because you care about the characters, you know the journey of how they got where they are and you know all too well their hopes and promises to the people they care for."

Soap opera setup for the big match that could only happen in the movies - brother against brother for a 5 million dollar purse, winner take all.  All performances are good but Tom Hardy is the standout.  If it had any originality it would be a great movie but we've seen it all before.  Still, it held my attention and the characters were interesting.  As far as the fight scenes go, get ready for the moving queasy cam.  This director likes the horrible technique of moving the camera around so much you can't always see what's happening.  It's just a lazy technique Hollywood uses to fool the audience into thinking more is going on than your eyes can see.  Overall good but not great."

However the film features so many plotlines that it confuses quite a few times in the film. It seems that whenever a plotline is answered, Another plotline pops up. It doesnt help that they are so dreadfully generic as well.\r I loved the mma sequences in this film. I just hated how they played out the same way almost every time. Its unrealistic. No mma fight ends the exact same way for every fighter, Any mma fan knows that. Also a 5 million dollar tournament with the best fighters in the world? There are grand prixs that happen all the time with the best fighters in the world and the fighters make no where near this amount of money. Not even combined. I also hated the fact that 2 unknown, unranked fighters got into a tournament with the best middleweights in the world. Brendan was barely a .500 fighter in his prime (that means barely kept his wins and losses even) and Tommy is an unknown fighter with no professional experiance who only got in because he KOed a top ranked guy during sparring and he was a war hero. Again really unrealistic.\r The plot does take away greatly from the movie but it is still a satisfying movie that is well worth the watch."

Gavin O'Conner does a great job here by making a film that revolves around 2 brothers and a recovering father who wants his sons back. Its an extremly real and extremely touching story that transcends the sport the movie revolves around. It also does a great job building up the fights by slowly linking the two brothers and their pasts together.

I just saw the ad for it and decided, \"meh, might as well.\" Best decision I have made recently as far as movies go. The emotional moments are gripping and you feel for the characters, even if their situations are as predictable as they can get (e.g. man fighting to get his family out of financial straits). The story is actually incredibly predictable, and I knew who was going to triumph at the end of it all. The action is fast-paced, and often brutal but enjoyably so. I actually felt my muscles tense up at specific points during the film, even after I had a firm grasp of how everything was going to turn out. I still had to tell myself to relax, because of the intensity of the fights as well as the intensity seem in emotions of the main characters. This movie makes me excited to see more of Hardy in the near future (Dark Knight Rises, anyone?). I have been recommending this film to anyone who is willing to listen to me. This really does give something for either gender as well, because it's not just about a bunch of men beating the sh*t out of each other."

Warrior is well acted and its cast gives very believable performances. The story does resort to using cheap tactics to make the audience feel for the characters, the poor family who cant make ends meet and the husband having to resort to fighting is something we have seen many times in movies like this but the film does make it all work and is entertaining and satisfying.

My first glance, I thought it's gonna be like The Fighter since this film is about fighting sports and there's a brother relationship. But here, the brothers are against to each other. The film doesn't really spend so much time dealing with their relationship. It mostly goes to the father of the main leads. Tom Hardy (Tommy Conlon) delivers a moving and emotional performance of a man who has suffered greatly from the ones he loves, and from the field of battle, an all to real reality for people of today. While the younger Tommy suffered the loss of his mother firsthand, his older brother Brendan (Joel Edgerton)has put together a life that a man dreams of, yet is still haunted daily by his past. Only to have it threatened to be destroyed by the bank. Nick Nolte the alcoholic father of the two, has suffered years of remorse and regret from the abuse of alcohol and the neglect of his wife and children is trying to forge a bond but is meeting a stone wall with both of his sons. The fighting, though it is very well acted and shot, is not about fighting. It is the physical representation of the struggle between the three men, the struggle to forget and forgive and to move on. The demons that possess all three of these men are of such great proportion, the only way they can be relinquished is for them to come together. Definitely a must see movie this year!"

Tom Hardy played a serious, aggressive character \"Tommy\" who's in it to win it, and won't stop until he gets what he wants. Joel Edgerton plays as \"Brendan\" who is Tommy's brother in the movie, who is a school teacher trying to provide money and food for his family, then he decides he wants to fight in a parking lot because he can earn a lot of money. Nick Nolte another brilliant actor, played as the father of the two sons. Who is trying to get the family back together but is on drugs and struggles. The fighting in this movie is Excellent, especially with the addition of former Olympic Gold Medalist, Kurt Angle played his role as a dangerous Russian fighting who doesn't get the chance to talk in the movie, but lets his fighting do the talking for him. Overall, this movie is AMAZING. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Sports/ MMA/Fighting movies obviously, and anyone who enjoys very dramatic & Inspiring stories.

What you expect to be a cliche, comes as a well served emotional moment.From almost the start you know how it will end. And it does. And I don't mind it.It's just like looking at a kitten at YT. You know it's probably gonna be cute and it bores you. But when you watch the clip you go \"mom, please\".The same goes for this movie.The actors excel, each and every one. You don't get to hear the whole story or see them do what you expect. The brother's meeting should be about \"I had problems\", \"well, i have problems, too\".No. They don't say it. They define where they are now. They don't exchange problems. They keep 'em to themselves. While you know it well, the keep them to themselves. And that's what makes this film worth watching.I kept my fists closed even if I knew what was going to happen. And that's a great thing for me, especially. This is the best movie I've seen this year.Nick Nolte has established himself in my eyes as one of the best old generation actors now (above and beyond De Niro or Pacino, seriously!) and Hard on the newbies side. Joel Edgerton provides as well, while Jennifer Morrison is no longer irritation as in House M.D. Kudos for all the cast.

It let you see the pain each character feels, let you guess at some of the experiences these characters had gone through.  Words DONT solve everything, and they certainly dont always help.  Much of our lives and relationships are subconciously built around things Unspoken, and this movie recognises this and therefore makes its interactions more honest becuase of it.Also, the fight scenes were spot on.  Honestly brutal, while not being overly bloodthirsty.  If your fighting at that level, you need focus.  Without it, your just brawling.  The overwhelming intensity of Tommy (Tom Hardy) is almost shocking.  Made more so becuase there is no boasting, no glorification, no real menace to him, he is just that strong, just that physically powerful.  This contrasts with his brother who has little actual physical presence, but a focus and a drive that makes it possible for him to challenge at this level.  i.e. Tommy knocks you out, Brenden taps you out etc.Part of the power of the enstrangement in this film is that Brenden is just as eager for forgiveness and reconcilliation from his younger brother as their father is, even while he struggles with unreconcilled jelousy from the attention 'Tommy' got from their father (who was training Tommy in junior wrestling).  While Tommy is just a huge powerderkeg of continued PTS, Survivors guilt and emotional abandonment.To be honest, I think it might have been a bit too suble and unspoken on occasion, so many people who have not had any similar expeciences, or known anyone who had, may not have grasped the true ramifications of what was left unspoken.  In particular the Surviors guilt for Tommy and Brenden's first true understanding of the regret that unresolved guilt brings.  I thought it was a brilliant movie.  Entertaining, powerful, interesting and quality. It was not shown at a lot of cinema's in America (prob becuase of the whole 'friendly fire' issue) so it wont make the money it normally would, but I expect it will do a brisk trade on DVD.  And to be honest it was not really advertised as the emotional sucker punch it actually was.  The fighting, while entertaining, wasnt the focal point of the movie at all.  Becuase of this its viewing base may be mislead.  A lot of people who would truly enjoy this movie may be scared off by the apparent physical violence of it.  If you are one of those people, go watch it.  It is seriously worth it."

      "text": "This movie is about two brothers and their inner and outer conflicts with each other and with the world around them. What makes this film special though is where and how they resolve their conflicts: a fight in a MMA tournament.The build-up to that final moment is almost perfect: seamless, calm, yet not too boring all the same. Back stories and history of the two and what role their father plays is brought in gradually and in an interesting manner.Yes, the first part of the film may be quite long, and may be boring in the minds of people who adore action, but once the film enters the second part, pure adrenaline-pumping suspense kicks its way onto the big screen. I've watched tons of movies, from nearly all genres, but never have I watched a film that captures true and gritty combat in such a realistic way. The fight choreography is superb. Add to that the fact that the fight scenes are captured using a wobbly camera, making the fights all the more realistic. Many may dislike this realistic touch, but I loved it, because it helps you to integrate your mindset with that of the characters, that is, it aids in reflecting the emotions and desires of the two characters. During some moments, I sincerely felt like I was the one taking hits. The camera angles, the shakiness, and the excellent fight choreography make this film a masterpiece in the realistic aspect of it all.To top it all off, the two brothers are both \"heroes\", but it ultimately depends on personal preference when it comes to differentiating good from bad.The best film of 2011? No, I don't believe it is, but Warrior surely deserves to be among the top 5 films of 2011. Watch it. Now."

I really don't know which brother I liked better: Tommy, an ex-Marine with regrets whose trying to make up and repair for it, or Brendan, whose family's welfare rides on his success or failure. You too will face this tough decision in this amazing film."
