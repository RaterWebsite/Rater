      "text": "This is a sports related comedy drama film based on a true story (aka with a biopic element), covering themes of hope and perserverance while  featuring a loveable underdog in the main role. Eddie comes across as quite naive but in an endearing way - someone who wouldn't let those around him force him to give up his dream. Yes its relatively cheesy/corny and the ending is relatively obvious but I found it to be an enjoyable watch regardless.I thought the music used was judged well for the most part in not being especially distracting or overpowering (i.e. loud), certainly in the first half of the film. It was fairly understated, somewhat subtle towards the start, although there were some synth-y segments but then that makes it sound quite 80s-ish, which of course makes sense in as much as the film is set in the 1980s. The use of songs becomes a bit more overstated and less subtle towards the end of the film, for fairly obvious reasons. Some scenes feature chart pop songs from the 80s and examples of such tracks played include Two Tracks by Frankie Goes To Hollywood, The Sky's The Limit by Nik Kershaw and Real Gone Kid by Deacon Blue.The dialogue seemed reasonable. There were some quite amusing moments, mainly between Eddie and Bronson. Its safe to say that egos are at play at times, although Eddie doesn't necessarily realise this.  Cast wise, Eddie is played by Jack Costello. Eddie both looks and sounds like a bit of a dreamer, being relatively naive (as I say) while also clearly passionate and you could say quite courageous as well. As a character, he appears somewhat geeky and reserved (shy) and as such I felt he was a character that was easy to wish the best for. I found his optimism rather uplifting (I did say it was a cheesy film!). The other main character is Bronson, played by Hugh Jackman. He comes across as very cocky and very dismissive of Eddie at first but also a warm, caring companion in time. He tries his best to be realistic and helpful in his coaching Eddie, while shielding him from some aspects and I'd say he is the sort of character that we'd all like to know. Other characters include Warren Sharp, played by Christopher Walken (although his is a brief appearance), Richmond the BOA official, played by Mark Benton and Dustin Target, played by Tim McInnerny.The film features some nice landscape shots of Canada and other mountainous areas Eddie obviously 'cuts his teeth on'. There are some nice shots of sunrise and sunset as well and generally I felt the camerawork was handled quite well - there are also some good examples of jumps shown from particularly good angles to demonstrate the distance covered. Content wise, the film contains some mild profanities, a few sex references by the coach but I imagine these would go over the head of particularly young kids (at a guess) and a few scenes of skiiers who have crash landings when attempting to jump. Otherwise there's nothing really to note - the film carries a PG rating to reflect this.I found myself with my head between my hands, feeling almost at the edge of my seat during the most nerve wracking scenes. Of course its easy to find out what happens but that doesn't make it seem any less nervewracking to watch the key jumping attempts and other key scenes, or so I found. I found it overall a very enjoyable film to watch, as I felt quite emotionally attached to Eddie for the loveable, if but rather childish, person he's portrayed to be. I could really feel for the character when he was doubting his ability and feeling his passion, his strength to want to prove people wrong.I felt his story was ultimately quite inspirational and it was a fairly heartwarming watch in general, one that should be suitable for the majority of a family to watch, so if your looking for something to entertain a few generations of a family then this may well be worth considering.Yes I'd recommend this film as I found it an entertaining and enjoyable watch. I thought the cast were good, there was some decent camerawork and the soundtrack was fun. It certainly is sentimental and cheesy but thats pretty much what you should expect of such a film really, isn't it?. For what it is, its not bad and so I'd recommend it."

This honest man tried different Olympic sports until he found the fabulous and adventurous ski jump, the surprising thing is that the guy not highlighted by being the best the the matter. The film is responsible for narrating the whole growth of Eddie in terms of sport while providing a dramatic and comic experience from beginning to end. I can only mention, I cried like a small child.\r Our boy \"Kingsman: The Secret Service\", Taron Egerton comes back to seven art, he introduce himself to 100% in his role, this time not as a super agent, this time with large glasses, hair blond and even a strange blonde moustache. Egerton fills his role as nuanced perfectly balanced tones allowing to see the pure soul of his interpretation. Hugh Jackman plays coach Eddie - a successful athlete champion ski jump that is forced by his heart to help this young man to succeed- . True, the film by Dexter Fletcher is a feast of cliches, but well-structured cliches, with chemistry, support and strength to take forward a true dramatic inspirational artwork. The project is a faithful proof that with less materials, better results. It was a surprise in the Sundance Film Festival and won gold, now, it was a surprise in the rest of the world and the chances of winning a gold more large increase exponentially.\r Dexter Fletcher has created his own cover letter. However, he knew who was dealing with a persevering man (who was not going to win gold medals) managed to capture history with a conventional double-edged weapon. A bullet from his gun was the comedy. The director was prone to cross the thin border of the comedy to become a mockery or joke based on story. He reached the exact point in the soup to create a succulent dish, excellent aggregation of sugar. Aim, fire. The second bullet is shot, the drama. The main reason was to tell all the mishaps economic, mental, physical and psychological that possessed the guy, for obvious reasons,, the biopic would have to be oriented to the guy, good aggregation of salt. What remains after together salt and sugar in a precise point? A real treat for the palate, in this case the visual palate.\r The visual presentation of the work was very professional and aesthetic. The cinematography of George Richmond is beautiful and elegant, making feel vertigo on the track of 15m, 30m, or 90m in the same way by using the camera and perfectly positioned angles. And to continue to grow, as it is typical of Hollywood, introduce a few seconds the short but symbolic appearance of Christopher Walken - the trainer of Hugh Jackman - to make it look even more professional.\r Eddie does not want women, he just wants to his mother, Eddie doesn't want fame, just wants to participate, Eddie does not want alcohol, he only wants to milk, Eddie does not want sex, he just wants love. These characteristics are completely emotional and  with a finish that I didn't expect, my tears simply fell for my eyes, but a factor that helped my sadness and joy at the same time, it was the self-identification with the character of Taron (Eddie), I think I saw my future on him. So, well done Egerton! task was made very well.\r It isn't a story more of the bunch where anything is possible. Dexter's film is sentimental and more deep than it seems, a guy that don't mind the standards of money, education or culture, a guy who fixed a dream in his head and managed to leave a huge mark on world history. \"Eddie the Eagle\"  will triumph in most festivals, I promise you. Boldly funny, very well presented, with a 100 in all its aspects, the movie has affected me for rest of my life. Everyone to the cinema already!\r \"The most important thing in the Olympic Games is not winning but taking part; the essential thing in life is not conquering but fighting well\"   Pierre de Coubertin."

It doesn't push the pathos or heroics too far, with both Fletcher and lead actors Taron Egerton and Hugh Jackman keeping the film grounded as a peculiarly British homespun hero story. It felt like there was some sort of osmosis between this film and the likes of Local Hero or Gregory's Girl. The humour is subtle, but punchy enough to keep us interested. And props to the cast and crew for keeping things in PG terroritory!\r A beautifully presented, heartwarming tale of triumph (sort of) against the odds."

Surprisingly the film was much better than I anticipation. This is a biographical-sport film and very inspiring. The story of a British boy in the early 70s who dreamt to be an Olympian, but the problem is he has not found his sports. By the time in his 20s, he finally finds his interest and gives his best to make his long pending wish to come true. The remaining narration reveals his journey to the world's one of the big events where he aims to soar like an eagle.\r Hugh Jackman was not any terrific, he was awesome like usual, but in a supporting role. I think Taron Egerton will be the next British sensation. This film worth seeing for his phenomenal act. The real Eddie too appreciated that. The whole film revolved around these two characters and I think making it a comedy worked out so well. Nicely shot film in the beautiful places, especially those risky ski jump stunts were excellent and the direction was undoubtedly the best.\r This film is not particularly about the sport, it is about one showing his passion towards his undertaking. Eddie can be seen as a role model, no matter what he achieved, his fighting spirit is motivating. I think the youngsters should watch it, especially those who are after their dreams. Not just sport persons, but any field persons. I don't know about the repeat viewing, but watching once is enough for the confidence uplift. One of the must see film of the 2016.\r 8/10"

I\u2019m getting a bit bored of sports film cliches and I think this  film has cemented that for me.

It has inspiration, it has heart, and, like its lead characters, is warm, fuzzy and aggressively likeable.\r The movie stars Taron Egerton ('Kingsman: The Secret Service') as Michael Eddie Edwards, who, since he was a young boy, wants to compete in the Olympics. As a child, he has had to have a brace attached to his left leg, which is very similar to the story of 'Forrest Gump' (1994), and as he gets older, he no longer needs them as his legs have fully formed and is able to walk without any support.\r He decides that he still wants to ski in the Winter Olympics, his loving mother always tries her best to support him and give him some confidence. However, his father is very discouraging and cynical, I couldn't help but feel that the movie was trying its hardest to make him an unlikeable character, but it didn't really work. He seemed like the typical parent that has no faith in any other movie protagonist.\r On the way, Eddie meets a man named Bronson Peary (Hugh Jackman), who he learns also did what he wanted to do, and they agree to help Eddie get to the best and compete in the Winter Olympics.\r The movie, directed by Dexter Fletcher is absolutely a fine piece of work, the acting is well committed and the story is a good story to tell. It is, like I said above, very cliched and pretty much like any other movie out there. It plays like 'Forrest Gump' (1994), the very idea of a nobody who quickly becomes a somebody despite the fact that many may have ridiculed this character from achieving their goals.\r Overall, this is a movie to watch if you like inspirational and underdog films, it's well worth your time to know who this \"Eddie the Eagle\" really is..."

Devoid of any cynisism and concerned only with leaving the audience cheering for the underdog.It's full of clich\u00e9s, but also full of heart and positivity.A feel-good movie in the best sense."
