I don't know what those professional critics are grumbling about, because \"Sherlock\" impressed us as being a fast, funny, and visually imaginative entertainment. The thematic elements were good points to make and were well-expressed. Would we have seen it without our Movie Pass cards? Probably not, but thanks to our wonderful MP membership, we took a chance on this one. So glad we did... and by the way: The movie theater was empty when we saw it. We were the only two customers."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Should I start mentioning its empty plot, scattered chasing sequences that are put one after another with no reason, its absurd and silly jokes that just are not funny?

An absolute masterpiece of animation with a compelling storyline, hilarious characters, and strong character development, making for the best movie based of an anime so far in 2018."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "I literally wished that Gnomeo and Juliet to be at least original with its slapstick plot and thought that was bad enough compared to the source material it's based on. On its own, it was mediocre. Then I saw Sherlock Gnomes and wondered what was Johnny Depp doing there. He literally killed the show more than enough times that Johnny Depp is literally the only good thing about this slap-in-the-face poor-man's slapstick attempt to parody Sherlock Holmes. The other actors and actresses have no chance of outshining him in their own game that they dominated in its predecessor. Sadly, like the other actors and actresses, Johnny Depp suffocated his acting career just for an absurdly stupid film that just gets stupider every minute."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "This doesn't deserve a review. I watched the first film and it sucked. I watched the first 30 minutes of this one and left the theater immediately. This film shouldn't exist."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "This movie is just pointless. Like if they want to tell a silly kids story about Sherlock Holmes, why have it be a sequel to a bad 2011 film no one remembers? And considering the box office performance of this film, it's a real bonehead decision!There are some positives...I guess. The animation has improved a lot after the first film. The textures are nice, the set pieces look big, and the action scenes are pretty fun that will surely entertain the kids. It does feel like an expansion to the first film, even if it is filmsy. The voice cast isn't terrible, not remarkable either, but they do a decent enough job. Emily Blunt, James McAvory, Chitwetel Ejiofor, and Mary J. Blige did a solid job, as does Johnny Depp despite some bad reads every now and then, and Jamie Demetriou does stand out as Moriarty. Also the gargoyles look pretty cute despite them being menacing killers.Okay so the negatives. The whole premise of this film feels like a very flimsy attempt at making a sequel when it really should not have been. There is no real reason why this is a sequel to Gnomeo and Juliet, no true benefits other than it being a safe attempt at making money (it made less than the first film). The conflict is forced, as Gnomeo acts like a whiny ass to Juliet and is totally unlikable, as is the titular Sherlock Gnomes. The film never offers any true laughs, unless you are under the age of 10 or are a parent that's been numbed by life to find lame jokes funny. There is a twist that is painfully obvious. And there is no real reason why Elton John songs are used in the film since they barely play any of his music besides an awful remix of Don't Go Breakin' My Heart at the opening credits. Also them removing Jim Cumming's character from the first film is a travesty, since the flamingo is the best part of the first film and damnit Jim Cummings is one of the best voice actors alive how dare they!Honestly I don't have much to say since this is just a bargain barrel kids film. It's not the worst thing ever, but hardly redemptive nor worth more than the rating I am giving it. It's passable, but kids deserve a lot better!Also how come everyone was so up and arms that Johnny Depp is going to be in the next Fantastic Beasts film in spite of his domestic abuse allegations, yet NO ONE said anything about him being the voice of the titular character in a children's film?
