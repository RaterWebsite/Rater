It had a great pace and even some cute musical numbers.  I found the storyline to be pretty cliche, but that's like all children's movies.

Blu, a rare type of Macaw who has never learned how to fly, must embark on the adventure of his lifetime with the strong, independent Jewl, a female Macaw of his kind; both around and in the city of Rio De Janierio, Brazil. The film both figuratively, and literally soars with great moments for many of the characters featured within this movie. The heart of this movie is that there's a strong message, that by believing in yourself, there's almost no limit to what you can achieve. I loved this movie in theaters, and I can't wait to see it on Blu-Ray, literally! I highly recommend it for the entire family to see and enjoy!

Another reviewer had it exactly on the spot-- the characters had no soul. I'm not talking just about the predictable plot, the lack of background/development of any character other than Blu; my major beef with the movie was that every bird seemed the same. They come in different colors, but fly, dance, speak, and behave the same. Had the producers done more research or cared enough, they could have fit fun facts of these species better into their roles and plot. Kids came away from Nemo being fascinated by diverse deep sea wildlife; on the other hand, replace the birds with cats in Rio and we still have the same movie."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Hardly movies like these come around.

This is perhaps the largest and most prominent feature film centered around parrots ever. From a parrot owner's perspective, this is my impression of the movie as well as the realism of parrot ownership that it conveys.The story opens in the forest outside off Rio De Janeiro where birds do morning song and dance ritual. While the singing/dancing is of course personified, it certainly alludes to the natural morning song that birds sing.We get our first glimpse of Blu, the movie's hero, as a baby in a nest cavity. Parrots nest in cavities rather than building nests on branches so this was an accurate depiction. Blu is captured by poachers and smuggled to Minnesota. Like in half the pet featured movies out there, the crate carrying the hero character falls out of a truck and is discovered by the future owner. Not only does this make the owner appear benevolent for saving a lost animal, but it also absolves the owner from responsibility for buying into the illegal pet trade. However, there is actually some truth to the matter.Rio is actually partly based on a true story and a real species of Macaw. The movie simply refers to Blu as a Blue Macaw, however, at a later point in the movie Cyanopsitta Spixii species is mentioned. The Spix Macaw is one of four Blue Macaw species and was endemic to Brazil. However, due to poaching and deforestation of their natural habitat, Spix Macaws went extinct in the wild in the year 2000. Nonetheless, over 60 Spix macaws have been known to remain in captivity after their wild counterparts went extinct. Two years after the last Spix was observed in the wild, a veterinarian in the the United States was shocked to be consulted by an owner of one in Denver.http://TrainedParrot.com/Rio/"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Its a spectacular movie that bring you to a fantastic world of imagination.

Which means I end in up in the hospital because some animated fanboy beat up my nut sack with a baseball bat. The movie's villain was fairly dull but was still decently acted and originally plotted. Well if you think about it, many little kid movies have weak plots and are just plain stupid. I thought this was one of those movies, but it wasn't.

As a big fan of animated movies, I was greatly disappointed in this one. For me - the biggest downside is, that while other animated movies often feature  cute animals, are colorful, there are songs in them, and so on - little kids love that.

Well, Rio does not have that other side."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Overall the animation is very good, although I did not like some of the backdrops that looked liked cheaply drawn watercolor and did not match the crispness of the rest of the film.  This is a very colorful, highly energetic film.  The filmmakers make a mistake that many current animated films make, however, they rely almost entirely on the visuals for the humor.  I saw this in a theater filled with kids and many were restless and not paying attention (unlike most Pixar films where kids are totally into it).  This film needed more HUMOR, and I'm talking about humor coming from the written word.  The music throughout was good and energetic.  I believe this was made by the \"Ice Age\" studio, as a \"Scrat\" cartoon was shown at the start.  I'm not a big fan of the Ice Age movies either because of the lack of humor (although the first one was pretty good).

In particular, a number of scenes are simply painful to listen to, with many of the voice actors' lines feeling forced rather than natural - the dialogue often does not flow properly, and their attempts at making Blu funny mostly fail, because he doesn't fail in a manner which makes sense. Yes, he's a dork, but people don't talk like that!\r It doesn't help that they shoehorned in a pair of rappers, one of whom (Will.I.Am) is really very painful to listen to, isn't very talented (his singing is so bad that the OTHER RAPPER actually shuts him down -in the movie-. Both characters are entirely extraneous and were obviously shoehorned in for mass appeal, but Pedro (Will.I.Am's character) makes the movie worse for his presence, and the other does nothing to enhance it.\r On the upside, some of the music is quite good, the plotline is okay (though again, the dialogue makes the mandatory romance feel very forced), and the animation is beautiful and colorful."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Perfect for kids, but as much for adults.
