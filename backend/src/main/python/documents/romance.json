The story consist of a girl named Marie played by Caroline Ducey who's boyfriend refuses to have sex with her, so, she goes looking for a series of sexual encounters until she engaged into sadomasochism... wait... is this Fifty shades of Grey? well... no... but that part of the movie reminds me to it.The acting... well... it's boring, actors look and sound like if they didn't want to be there, so, that's a bad sign, right?It's not exactly a bad film, it has it's moments but the slow pacing and boring acting make it plain tedious, aparently the only parts of the film that look a bit more interesting are the sex scenes even if they are explicit and make you feel uncomfortable."}], "recommendations": ["red_sparrow", "the_river_wild", "magic_mikes_last_dance", "taking_lives", "atomic_blonde", "miami_vice", "feel_the_beat", "the_tourist", "fifty_shades_of_grey", "jolt", "haywire", "kate", "till_death", "blood_ties", "fifty_shades_darker", "into_the_blue", "that_awkward_moment", "a_simple_favor", "baby_driver", "hanna", "look_away", "brimstone", "perfect_sisters", "magic_mike_xxl", "safe"]}
