      "text": "\u201cWonder Wheel\u201d is the annual film submission by writer-director Woody Allen and stars Kate Winslet, Juno Temple, Jim Belushi and Justin Timberlake. The film takes place in circa 1950 in Brooklyn\u2019s famed Coney Island section amidst the backdrop of the infamous wheel invented by Mr. Ferris. This writer\u2019s problem with the film stems from, firstly, the history of great films made by Mr.Allen and the tendency to compare each new entry with the gems of the past. Secondly, and on a much more personal note, the little old lady sitting next to me was using a device that displayed closed captioning and was a real distraction to the person sitting next to her, i.e. me. That being entered into the equation, I found the film to be mildly interesting with an all too simple plot. What makes the film standout, however, is the unbelievable acting of Ms. Winslet who dominates the screen whenever she appears and saves the film from the mediocrity to which it might otherwise have been relegated. Outstanding, too, are the performances of Mr. Belushi, Mr. Timberlake and Ms. Temple. But for me, a native Brooklynite and daily summer visitor to Coney Island, the water, beach, rides, boardwalk and the nostalgia they foster make the viewing experience that much more enjoyable. I give the film a 7 rating but wonder (no pun intended) how it would have played without Ms. Winslet and/or the location."

      "text": "Like he did for Cate Blanchett in Blue Jasmine, Woody Allen has given another Kate (Winslet) a role that allows her to go all out. Unfortunately, this character is so unbearably neurotic that's Winslet isn't liable to win an Oscar (as Blanchett did). She plays a waitress in '50s Coney Island who's married to a blustery carousel operator (Jim Belushi). His estranged daughter (Juno Temple) shows up on the lam from gangsters, while the local lifeguard (Justin Timberlake, who also acts as narrator) causes hearts to flutter. The period creation is fun and Vittorio Storaro's gold-infused cinematography adds visual richness. There are obvious parallels to Tennessee Williams and/or Eugene O'Neil, but this screenplay only features continuous conflicts and melodramatic histrionics that lack much depth or emotion. Since it's Allen, there's a level of filmmaking competence, but its flaws outweigh its strenghs."

      "text": "Woody Allen has directed about 53 films, averaging one a year for the past 50 years, and about 1 out of 5 are very good or excellent, 30 bearable to watch and the rest are pretty bad, to which he can add \u201cWonder Wheel\u201d. It is as if he didn\u2019t give Justin Timberlake any direction and just told Kate Winslet to be Cate Blanchett in \u201cBlue Jasmine\u201d, who was a rip-off of Blanche Dubois in \u201cA Streetcar Named Desire\u201d, and it is the first time I can remember feeling she was just doing a bad acting job or was, at least, in a different movie. Seeing either of them on screen, saying trite sentences, was painful except for some beautiful lit headshots of her. Who sabotages her most is Woody Allen, the writer, with some of the tritest sentences ever uttered on screen with poor imitations of Williams, Eugene O\u2019Neill and others.Jim Belushi seemed to be a combination of Stanley, without the body but the attitude, and Mitch in \u201cStreetcar\u201d, while Juno Temple starts off as an uninteresting part of the film but develops her character nicely as the film comes towards the finish.Now if I could only figure out why Jack Gore, as a child from Winslet\u2019s first husband, is a pyromaniac and why he is even in the movie.Without getting into the whole Woody Allen-Mia Farrow-Dylan Farrow-Soon-Yi Previn aspects which is reflected in today\u2019s news this is definitely one of Allen\u2019s worst pictures as a director and writer and, for the first time, I felt Allen even got the music track wrong, completely annoying.The stars of \u201cWonder Wheel\u201d are not Allen but cinematographer Vittoria Storaro and Santo Loquasto the production designer."

      "text": "While stunning visually, this latest offering from Woody Allen has to rank among the worst of his films. With leads that are horribly miscast (especially Kate Winslet in a bombastic exercise of overacting), writing that's seriously bloated and in need of retooling, and characters who are neither likable nor believable, the film tells a tale that in many ways feels like a working class 1950s retread of \"Blue Jasmine\" with elements of \"Cafe Society\" thrown in. As much of a fan as I am of the director's work, I whole-heartedly recommend skipping this one -- and hope that he gets back on track with his next project."

      "text": "I really don't get the bad reviews this movie has gotten, I reckon Wonder Wheel is a shockingly underestimated gem, and usually I'm not a huge fan of Allen. But in this movie everything seems perfect to me,starting from the saturated palette created by Vittorio Storaro, which evokes a sense of celebrating nostalgia for the amazing '50s and stresses the dreaming nature of the protagonist (a Kate Winslet in state of grace), a palette that describes the protagonist's feelings, showed through a blue or a golden shade on her persona, Picasso's style. I loved the metatheatrical bits, the numerous references to the Greek tragedy (the movie itself feels like it's a stage play). And this is the best I can do with my second language."

It's more of a stage performance than a movie.It's amazing to me that Woody Allen can bump out a movie each year and make it so rich and old fashion. Unfortunately the film themselves have become a faded memory for me, expect for 'Midnight in Paris'. I don't remember a single thing that happened in his previous movie 'Caf\u00e9 Society'. This will suffer the same thing.Allen making a love triangle around a woman and her stepchild isn't the smartest thing to do with his controversial past. You are literally putting light on your issues. Sometimes art itself can't spare it's artiest."

And I'm quite disappointed because this one looked promising."

      "text": "Allen has hits and misses. Match Point was a hit, and with his other films, there are obvious misses. Wonder Wheel is a hit. It has a great measured pace and lyrical dialogue. Winslet embraces her role fully and it's hard to believe she wasn't nominated for best actor. Aesthetically cohesive it charmingly represents the 1950s. It comes across as a stage play made into a movie as the long monologues of the characters are engaging and revealing of their inner, human flaws. The storyline has a similar theme of his other works but the acting here becomes paramount - especially Winslet - and leaves the viewer less inclined to fault him for this. The Timberlake character does come across as too modern and slightly anachronistic but otherwise, this movie is greatly under-rated. Can't understand how it has received such poor ratings."

      "text": "\"Wonder Wheel\" is Woody Allen's 48th film, a love triangle set in 1950's Coney Island. The story centers on Ginny (Kate Winslet), a depressed clam bar waitress trapped in a loveless marriage, who begins a secret romance with a lifeguard (Justin Timberlake) while her husband's estranged daughter (Juno Temple) comes to stay with them. The film explores themes of past mistakes and damaged dreams, with a darker tone than Allen's previous works. Kate Winslet gives a standout performance, while the cinematography by Vittorio Storaro captures the vibrant colors of Coney Island. The film's stage-like feel and at times wordy dialogue detracts from the overall experience, but \"Wonder Wheel\" is still a good, toned-down offering from the prolific director._________________________________\"Wonder Wheel\" es la pel\u00edcula n\u00famero 48 de Woody Allen, un tri\u00e1ngulo amoroso ambientado en Coney Island en la d\u00e9cada de 1950. La historia se centra en Ginny (Kate Winslet), una camarera deprimida atrapada en un matrimonio sin amor, que comienza un romance secreto con un salvavidas (Justin Timberlake) mientras la hija separada de su esposo (Juno Temple) viene a quedarse con ellos. La pel\u00edcula explora temas de errores del pasado y sue\u00f1os da\u00f1ados, con un tono m\u00e1s oscuro que los trabajos anteriores de Allen. Kate Winslet ofrece una actuaci\u00f3n destacada, mientras que la cinematograf\u00eda de Vittorio Storaro captura los colores vibrantes de Coney Island. La sensaci\u00f3n de escenario de la pel\u00edcula y, a veces, los di\u00e1logos prolijos restan valor a la experiencia general, pero \"Wonder Wheel\" sigue siendo una buena oferta atenuada del prol\u00edfico director."
