There is so much that is unspoken and even unseen. If quiet, visceral films are not your thing; if you prefer stories that are more linear and \"eventful,\" you should probably skip this one. It requires a little patience and for you to allow some personal investment, but will reward you for allowing it to seep in."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Not to sound pretentious, but the people who don't understand the film are the ones to give it low scores. The only thing that the movie has going against it may be it's inaccessibility. It's funny, artistic, sensitive, endearing, subtle, and powerful.

This is a wonderful movie. It's a simple, slow-moving character study of two people in a foreign land who have little more waiting for them at their homes. They are lost and find one another. It's not plot-oriented in the cliched sense (hence, the numerous low scores, many, though not all, from people like Ed F. who need plots or action spoonfed to them). I agree with Alex, it's not mindless entertainment, but a soulful, beautiful film that touches on much deeper feelings than most films. Believe me, as someone who loves all movies, from silly comedies and action thrillers, to the most obscure highbrow art flicks, this is a fantastic movie."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Lost In Translation is a great romantic beautiful that I ever seen recently.

I now know better specifically why it drove me nuts watching it. I gave it a one just because of the visuals.\rI kept waiting and waiting and waiting for something to happen.  But, it didn't.  I'm not an action-oriented person but this movie barely breathes...and that's supposed to be what?  something worth my time?  Thanks to all these reviewers for helping me see others saw the sublime nothingness I saw."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Why is this film so praised? Our protagonists are a naive stuck-up girl right out of college and an equally stuck-up cynical actor. Neither show any real interest in Japanese culture (he's even quite disrespectful) and neither makes any really attempt to connect with the Japanese (even though they both get the chance to connect). Even though she seems to have a degree in philosophy and he seems to be somewhat of an intellectual type, their interactions remain mostly superficial. And still, their interaction with one another is pretty much everything we get to see for this entire film. I guess this film appeals to people just as pretentious and shallow as the main protagonist (which is the only reason I can think of to explain its popularity), but I personally found it hard to connect with either of them AT ALL.\r Further, I wonder how much sense it makes for their relationship to have remained purely platonic. Both seem to be estranged from their respective spouses, his wife is on the other side of the ocean, her husband is on a photo shoot for several days, both act like they haven't had sex in a long time, she's a beautiful impressionable young girl, he's a famous actor, they both don't shun alcohol and at one point they become close enough to lie together on a bed while he touches her feet. Maybe it's just me, but I personally find it hard to believe they didn't end up having sex together considering the aforementioned conditions. Anyway, the shame and confusion arising from such a situation (after both realise they made a mistake cheating their respective spouse) would at least have made a far more interesting film to watch Maybe this film appeals to people who never spent more than a few days in a foreign country, but having spent about 3 months in Poland I couldn't see anything I haven't experienced myself AT A FAR GREATER INTENSITY. For me, this makes \"Lost In Translation\" as exciting to watch as two people sitting at a bus stop waiting for the bus to arrive. Actually the latter would probably be more interesting, because the bus doesn't take THAT long to arrive."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "For me, this movie is simple yet  realistic and relatable story which has been beautifully made. Soundtrack is also gorgeous. Johansson is so young here, and cute, it's unbelievable. The husband is total weirdo and I have no idea how they have enough chemistry to be a couple. Murray's character is on another side is super believable. It's just a nice movie, honestly."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "There are some films that are so intellectual that they should not be mixed with commercial cinema. This film, with constant ramblings about loneliness, the meaning of love and the feeling of being lost (in life, in a city, in a marriage...) is certainly one of those films, unsuitable for those without the proper intellectual and philosophical disposition. Everything revolves around an actor and a young woman who, in the midst of their own frustrations, find themselves in the same hotel in Tokyo. They don't speak Japanese, they don't understand culture and mentality of that people (at the same time, innovative and traditionalist) and, after some talks, they understand that they're feeling the same yearnings for \"something more\", missing in their own lives. Chemistry between both characters is evident, it makes the public think that they will be lovingly involved at any moment, but not. It is an intellectual and sentimental chemistry that does not involve sensuality or romance. The biggest problem of the film is that it does not have much more to offer us and it has a very slow pace, lined by a slow soundtrack, to the taste of the director, Sofia Coppola. This will surely drive away the commercial audience, who usually wants entertainment and not a movie that makes them think."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This is a prefect example of a movie that's not about a plot, but about a mood. A simple story about two lonely people. It captures a sort innocent awkwardness that's both very relatable and really touching.Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are amazing and work extremely well together. Their chemistry is subtle and awkward, which works perfectly for the tone of the movie.The karaoke scene is probably one of my new favorite movie scenes ever.I love the ending. I love the soundtrack.

What a laugh, \"Check the box if your review contains spoilers\"  - there is NOTHING to spoil!"}, {"rating": "6", "text": "lost in translation is one of those movies that makes a person feel good for watching it. most of its viewers love its small \"Anti Hollywood\" feel, but BELIEVE me, aside from being a respectable piece of art (at best), lost in translation really doesnt offer much more to its viewers then that nice little indie feel. the problem with the movie is that there isnt enough character development involved. at no point did i as a viewer have a specific feeling for anyone in the movie because theres really not enough that i knew about them as people. its hard to say this movie does much more then offer the occasional chuckle. the characters are too distant to be relatable so of course when they say something funny it feels like a sad attempt to be witty. im not asking that every movie have characters that i can identify with, but its really important that at some point in a movie the audience member has a see where the character is coming from. this movie is beautifully acted. the only problem is that they play roles of people that no one really wants to see. these are 2 very distant people who eventually come together to make sense of it all, but its hard to think that the director does a very good job in showing the audience any of that. at no point later on in the movie are these characters really more developed then they were to begin with. for what its worth the movie did have a small amount of its dry humor, but in NO WAY is this movie a comedy. (NO SPOILERS AHEAD....) the ending is much different from the rest of the film and just for a second the audience gets a little piece of emotion. and you really see the characters for who they are. problem is the entire rest of the movie never set us up for such an ending. nobody wants a romantic happy ending garbage heap, but this movie was just so fixated on trying to be real that it just ended up being boring. as a viewer i felt that i was finally given the ending only because the director knew its what i wanted to see, and NoT because it was the actual direction the movie was meant to take. life doesnt always have a clear cut road and there arent always yes or no answers. this movie tries so hard to convey that message, but from actor to audience, somewhere in between the message seems to have been Lost in Translation."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "What a shame to waste money on such a bland, uninteresting, clich\u00e9 movie. My family has not yet forgiven me for bringing this video home one evening. Humour? Where? I am not quite sure where the Oscars came from and I wonder what the critics have been watching lately. It must be one of the worst films I have ever seen and I normally like Bill Murray!"}, {"rating": "3", "text": "There are a few redeeming qualities to this movie: (a) scarlett, (b) bill, (c) the ending. Why there are more non-redeeming qualities are as follows: (1) it's frankly not believable, (2) cliche' typical daddy save me complex-fantasy, (3) creating boring mood is plain boring (4) annoying by design to group Japanese culture as boring & silly, (5) it's pretentious & works hard to be clever (6) it's devoid of making a connection (7) effectively leaves audience empty. The most frustrating part is this movie has more potential. Both these characters could have pulled off so much more, could still keep that somber mood & developed more mystery & intrigue. I kept wanting more of Bill to step out, and needed more of Scarlett to bust. I have no patience for shallowness. This girl is in Tokyo. He is in Tokyo. Hard to be lost (souls) That is not believable. If they were in the middle of the Guam - maybe. If they can't bring energy to Tokyo, then they can't bring energy at all, and therefore these characters are frankly hopeless and that is the most unattractive part of this film. Why waste time with people that cant barely save themselves in the best of world-class circumstances. Yawn..ZZZZZzzzz."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "This may be the worst movie I have ever seen. I'm only giving it a \"1\" because I love Bill Murray. This movie is an hour and some odd minutes of my life I will never get back. Unfortunately, it is highly representative of a generation that needs to stop complaining and get off it's ass and get a life. No real plot, no drama, no climax, no deep discovery culminating in a social statement. It's about two pathetic souls that don't even know how to amuse themselves let alone each other."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "This movie is a poor piece of film, over-hyped by critics for no other reason save that the director's father is Francis Ford Coppola. Features Bill Murray and Scarlett Johannson in Tokyo for separate reasons. Japan and the Japanese are portrayed in a poor (and stereotyping) fashion, (video games, karaoke, gadgets, and the misprounciations of \"Ls\" as \"Rs\").There is borderline racism in this movie, as the way these two lead roles act, as if lost, estranged, abandoned, or stranded on the moon surrounded by Aliens. I've been to Japan (I'm a western European) and found no such culture shock. That is really the premise that this movie is built on - culture shock of White Western people finding themselves in Japan. And that is where it fell down for me. In terms of comedy, it was billed as \"Bill Murray - comedy genius - at his best.\" Far from it. I like Murray (Quick Change, Stripes, Caddyshack, etc.) This was just not funny, and I do not think there is any attempt for him to be funny.Scarlett. Well she does not do anything wrong, but does not do anything right either. All in all, a very poor script.  Very poor direction. A complete lack of substance, with ignorance and racism creeping in at times.Such a time sink."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Another great movie with Bill Murray in it.

The humor is rather crass, and much of it stems from ignorance/intolerance of other cultures."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Lost in Translation is thoroughly disappointing. It appears to be pretty much universally praised, yet it's a flawed film. I'll concede that it's beautifully filmed, that Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson give great performances and that the relationship between their two characters is sweet and endearing, as a tale of two lost souls finding a connection is always compelling. Despite these positives, the film puts forward an extremely patronising, stereotypical and borderline racist view of Japanese culture. By depicting a steady procession of carefully cherry-picked Japanese \"oddities\", it's almost like the film's main objective is to say \"hey, come laugh at the silly Japanese, they're not like Americans at all\". A recurring joke in the film is the mockery of Japanese speech pattern of the replacement of the letter r with the letter l. This gag is barely funny the first time it is used, but it is reprised four or five times throughout the film. In one of the key \"comedy\" scenes, Murray's character struggles to understand a heavily accented Japanese director during a photo shoot, and his mimicry of the poor man's voice to decipher each instruction isn't funny, just embarrassing, akin to the lack of logic behind an English-speaking tourist abroad raising his voice to make themselves understood to non-English speakers. To make matters even worse, the film is all-too-often slow or just plain boring. Beyond great chemistry between Murray and Johansson and striking aesthetics, the appeal of Lost in Translation is, well, lost in translation chiefly thanks to some criminal cultural insensitivity that really shouldn't be applauded in the modern world."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "One of my favorite movies. Bill Murray is incredibly, one of his best performances yet."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Beautiful, funny, touching, great acting, great direction, great cinematography, really great soundtrack. One of the best mood pieces ever. The thing people don't understand about this movie is that you don't WATCH it, you FEEL. it. Most movies are like classical music. LiT is like jazz. Most movies must follow rules, LiT doesn't follow any rule. There's no structure and that's a compliment. Like jazz, it's free flowing and to enjoy it you must let yourself go and just enjoy the ride. If you can't do that then you're going to be disappointed.

I love how these two characters connect for a brief moment in time when they are at very different places in their lives. It becomes a bond so intimate, that by the end, even we arent allowed into the privacy of their love(Im thinking of their last scene together). Great film. This film creeps up on you and lingers. All of a sudden this simple story about strangers in Tokyo becomes something more, about the fleeting bonds of unexpected friendship, love and time and chance, and how it can change your life even though it goes so quickly. I love how there is no real time limit on the space they inhabit together. Like, it doesnt go from point a to point b and then end at point c. One minute they are there, amidst the swirling lights of Tokyo, the next moment they are gone. Back to whatever reality is for both of them. Its almost like a dream. All you know is, they connected.

These films generally treat you as a passenger, explicitly making it clear when these points in the story are happening (perhaps by showing a big explosion or a car chase). It's a great formula for entertainment, and there is a place for these movies. But Lost in Translation is not one of these movies. It leaves some room for the viewer to interpret events, the nature of relationships, and so on.
