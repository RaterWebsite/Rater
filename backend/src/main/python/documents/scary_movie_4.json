      "text": "David Zucker's second stab at a Scary Movie is about as hit-and-miss as his first attempt. Leslie Nielsen is still great (when was he not?), and his not too subtle moronic presidential parody of George W. Bush has to deal with various threats to the planet from various Hollywood genres, with help from returning haphazard heroine Cindy (Anna Farris) and Craig Bierko, who's playing Tom Cruise from Spielberg's War of the Worlds. Easily the funniest scene in the film is the prologue, which finds Dr Phil and Shaquille O'Neal imprisoned in the infamous Saw bathroom. All the J-Horror spoofs (dominated by The Grudge) are also executed pretty well, but like always with this series, when the humour becomes lazily crude and body function-obsessed, the film achieves more in terms of sheer annoyance than anything that actually makes you laugh. I'm not saying Zucker is a dignified comedy genius lowering himself to depravity for the first time - Airplane and Naked gun were often very juvenile, but this kind of humour was well-timed and balanced with different kinds of jokes. When a film only uses gross-out comedy to promote childish snickers, then it comes across as incredibly shallow and unmemorable. Thankfully, Scary Movie 4, like its predecessor, has a couple of memorable and funny sequences, but the big laughs are few and far between."

      "text": "This is the fourth film in the \"Scary Movie\" franchise ... and this time, Cindy is going to get a new job as a health care provider and face an alien invasion. Of course, the film is full of satirical situations and parodies of notable films like \"Grudge\", \"War of the Worlds\", \"The Village\" and \"Saw\". That is, this film repeats the same formula that we already know. Despite this, it far exceeded my expectations. I felt that the jokes are much better and funnier than those of previous films, including the first one. The sexual load is still present, but it has been reduced and the dialogues are the best so far. Honestly, for me, this was the movie that I liked the most in the franchise, so far.There is no doubt at this point that the best thing that could have happened to the \"Scary Movie\" franchise was the change of director and screenwriter and the arrival of David Zucker. In the first two films, the Wayans clan dominated actors, director and screenwriters. In the third film, Zucker already takes the direction but accepts a script from the Wayans. Here, he had more control over what he wanted to do, assuming direction and script, which was undoubtedly an improvement.The film again features Anna Faris and Regina Hal in their usual characters. This time, I liked their work more. Hall's character, whom the previous films had made into a nymphomaniac, was much better developed here and the two actresses seem to have received better material to work with, obtaining better results from their efforts. I also enjoyed watching Leslie Nielsen, with a series of jokes and situations so anecdotical that it is impossible not to laugh. Honestly, I can understand why Nielsen has collaborated so actively with Zucker in other films: he knows how to get the best out of Nielsen, much to the public's delight. Alonso Boden is very good and Carmen Electra, Michael Madsen and Charlie Sheen do a satisfactory job. The cast, in general, did quite well. The opening sequence, with Phil McGraw and Shaquille O'Neal, is memorable.Technically, the film is quite interesting. There are good special effects and CGI and the sets and costumes also play their part very well. It is a longer film than the others, with about 90 minutes, within the average of a feature film. It has a good pace, it doesn't waste time, the jokes follow one another quickly and don't let the audience stop laughing."

Scary Movie is a parody. This is Spinal Tap is a satire. Parodies poke fun at something and sometimes retell a story in a comic or ridiculing way. Satires usually create their own story and actually play to be fans of the works they are mimicking. Either can be funny and that is what their intentions are, they are usually sub-genres of comedy. The problem with The Scary Movie films are they are parodies that keep poking fun at something that it continuously keeps doing so that you almost pitty the work they are mimicking. These movies parody horror movies, usually of the last few years, though the first two movies in the franchise played off the classics. I found this in much better taste, considering more people could get a kick out of them. The last two films do just the opposite and it is clear that the movies have established their target audience, the people who have gone to the theater to go see these recent crappy horror films. The third film was much better than its previous, especially introducing Leslie Nielsen as the idiotic and"

However there are great jokes and good humour in this movie while I must admit at the same time that half of the jokes did not work that well. It is hit and miss in a pure form. The cameos are dividing the viewers. Some enjoy them and others say the movie is overstuffed with them. The foundation for this movie are War of the Worlds and The Grudge with many side-blows to other movies like Saw, Million Dollar Baby, The Village and others. I am also divide by this movie. I see the potential for a far better movie that is hold back by poor jokes and to much content. Maybe they should have made less references and stick more to fewer but better developed humour. It is hard to describe what makes classics like Spaceballs and the Naked gun work. For me it is the structure, developing ideas and the seriousness in giving us hilarious spoofs, jokes and parodies. This movie hits the marks not often enough while missing many by far. The acting is what you expected from this sort of movies. It is a vehicle for the humour. Overall not worth seeing as a whole movie with a few notable exception as some scenes and jokes are great."

The humor is immature and stupid and is just sick alot of the time - may I point out I'm a teenager, soif I find it immature, what would most people feel about it. Another problem with it also is that many of the jokes are reused from other shows. There is one example when they try to steal clothes by beating the person up but just get beaten up and you feel like shouting \"That's off The Simpsons!\". Its just a shame that they waste the talent of Leslie Nielson on this tripe, concidering hilarious films like Airplane."

This movie was chock full of slapstick comedy that was comparable of a 6th grade boy running into a wall 32 times in a row in order to get attention. After the 2nd time it loses its appeal, yet it never ends... ever. The parody aspect of the movie was so lackluster that many of the people in the theater were like \"What movie is that from?\" I will be the first to admit there are a large amount of stupid people in my geographic area (no I don't live in Alabama), but there was not a single incident in the entire movie that motivated me or any of the surrounding viewers to give even a sympathy laugh. However, the good part about this movie was that I snuck into it after watchin Ice Age 2. Overall assessment - not a single shred of talent - 0 out of 10."

This is the kinda movie that throws everything, including (quite literally) the toilet seat, at the target in hope that some will stick. And I guess a lot do. This was a lot like Date Movie for obvious reasons, though a big difference is David Zucker is involved, and like Airplane there are a few very funny and truly witty pieces of dialogue, though here it is quite a bit scarcer. The potty humor is really awful, but a surprising amount of the gags are so silly or done in a way that it's hard not to laugh. I actually felt that Date Movie for the most part had more gags per minute. If you liked any of the movies that are spoofed here, especially War of the Worlds, I think it's worth going to if you go in with the right mind set."
