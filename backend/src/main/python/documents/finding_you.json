Because this film is predictable at every plot point, you can rest assured that they\u2019ll be an item before it\u2019s over. The writers of this film decided that it was necessary to have several subplots to drag out the length and add no value (at least one of them features Vanessa Redgrave). With a romcom like this, you at least need interesting or quirky characters to make it special. Sadly, Reid\u2019s performance as written is relatively bland, while Goodacre gets to flash his considerable dimples and the charm that goes with them. Ultimately, this is an inconsequential little romance without anything that sets it apart. Wild Mountain Thyme is a similar story set in Ireland did a much better job of showing off the scenery and creating a story with more interesting characters."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "(Mauro Lanari)Scraping the barrel of stories for Teen / Young Adult, you come across works that are less and less plausible and convincing.
