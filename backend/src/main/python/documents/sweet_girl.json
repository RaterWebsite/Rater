      "text": "Sweet Girl was a weird disappointment.I wanted to like it because of jason momoa.  But it started out as an ok revenge action flick then abruptly wtf detoured into an unconvincing psycological horror film and then disintergrated into unbelievable cliches as if the producers realized what a mess it was and simply wanted to end production asap!"

      "text": "Another woke female empowerment movie that makes zero sense. This 5'1 100 pound girl sized up every dude with Jason Momoa's size and strength during every fight scene and somehow took out trained mercenaries with 2 years of basic MMA training. Basically someone in the writer's room had to be a spoiled kid whose father was the director to get this idea approved."

      "text": "After his wife dies, her husband (Jason Momoa) decides to seek revenge on the greedy pharma company that made her cure too expensive. After his first attempt goes wrong, he and his daughter (Isabela Merced) go on the lam to save themselves and exact that payback. Despite the absurdity of several of the situations (ex: almost every time they get into a scrape in public, nobody else is around), the action is solid and the pace keeps them running. Momoa\u2019s early scene grief is truly heartbreaking and he ably manages to play the soft part of his tough character. Merced holds her own thru the frustration and the entanglements. There\u2019s nothing especially original here, but if you can ignore reality and just enjoy the improbably chase, it\u2019s a sturdy little summer diversion."

      "text": "It's exhausting because of how generic it is. And although perhaps the script with a pharmaceutical company in the middle as the villain of the story could've lent itself to something more productive, the story never does anything relevant with it.Sweet Girl is simply the classic action movie that goes absolutely nowhere, because it just hopes that your entertainment is tied to you buying the complete implausibility of its story.Especially its totally unconventional plot twist.It's Netflix though, so it's not surprising at all."

      "text": "Sweet girl is an unofficial sequel to Terminator. The attacker from the metro takes lethal blows as if they are balloons, even tough a single punch or push against a pole is enough to land in the hospital. But not this Terminator who throws a 220 lbs weighing Jason Momoa through a fortified window... Buuuullshiiiiiit!Well... At least his daughter is a treat to look at. Unfortunately the father and daughter aren't quiet smart, as they immediately become lowlife criminals and murderers after the death of a 'so called' journalist.Mediocre movie that fails to immerse or entertain the viewer. Actors don't seem to be immersed in their roles, and stumble towards the end with little weight behind it. 3/10."

It's like the director/writer forgot the whole \"unreliable narrator\" schtick from the 90s/early 00s. (I'm referring to Fight Club, The Usual Suspects, Adaptation...movies that make you question everything you've seen due to a surprise twist.)I'm also tired of movies that feature tiny girls beating up big guys. Unless they're genetically modified super weapons."
