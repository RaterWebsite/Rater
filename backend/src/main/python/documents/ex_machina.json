I highly recommend watching it."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Style over substance in Alex Garland's directorial debut. A stage play in essence but with the beautiful Norwegian landscape and an ultra sleek subterranean futuristic research slash eccentric billionaire den as background. The Turing test plot is very familiar and has been done better elsewhere numerous times. This pales in comparison to Blade Runner for example,the yardstick. Even the most recent AI flick I saw 'Morgan' is better.

For all of it's expertly crafted tension this game of manipulation turned out exactly how I thought it would. Which is to say that when all is said and done Ex Machina isn't all that different from the countless other films out there with similar premises. The ride up to that point is still thrilling however, with strong themes and three exciting performances that will give you at least a little bit of doubt in regards to who can be trusted.The ominous soundtrack and the fact that I already knew that things weren't what they seemed filled me with unease. This is something Alex Garland made excellent use of to create a very unnerving atmosphere and reveals that come off as even more twisted than they already would have. For me this was freakier than most of the horror films I've watched. Of course the concept of playing mind games with AI already deeply disturbs me. That's not to take away from the performances of Oscar Isaac and Alicia Vikander though. Those two are key reasons things feel so dangerous.The back-and-forth pull between which of their characters the protagonist would be better off trusting hinges on the question of what it means to actually be human. Isaac's character may be a little unhinged, but he is another person so it stands to reason that while he is manipulating his house guest in some way, he's probably not a real threat. Ava on the other hand is an inhuman entity unlike anything else Gleeson's character would have previously encountered. We don't know if she feels empathy enough to not slaughter anyone she comes in contact with if she were to be set free. She's clearly hasn't had the most desirable \"life.\" That could very well have led to a hatred of humans. A lifeform she could view as inferior anyway. Vikander gives a suitably alien performance that provides Ava with a certain disconnection from her flesh and blood counterparts. Is she using her sexuality to manipulate a lonely and na\u00efve individual, or is it possible for her to actually feel something more than a need to deceive?Ex Machina is another movie about the dangers of playing God. It's really good at getting you to ask questions. Certain twists and the ending itself are easy to predict. Meaning that it doesn't deviate too much from convention story-wise. Yet it's never robbed of atmosphere or tension so this is still a very effective thriller. It's also an intelligent piece of science fiction. One with a sexual angle that stems from the very human condition of never wanting to be alone and belief that if we aren't screwing, we aren't living. Alex Garland wasn't just satisfied with getting under our skin. He wanted to get inside our heads as well. And I, for one, think he succeeded rather marvelously.

It may not break any ground conceptually if you're a sci-fi movie buff, but the acting is excellent (the A.I. in particular... obviously), and the plot isn't nearly as predictable or flawed as others might say (unless perhaps you just sit there trying to guess the ending and nitpick at the plot instead of enjoying the movie, as many negative reviewers here clearly were).  A truly excellent movie with stunning visuals and special effects, and a engaging plot with a great ending."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Ex Machina is film that tries to be too clever for its own good. The premise is simple enough...\rGuy working for a big 'search engine' style company \"wins\" a competition to spend time with the company's mysterious and God-like CEO at his top secret research facility/retreat.\r Upon arriving he discovers the CEO is an incredibly eccentric man, overbearing, aggressive, drinking heavily and using stimulants to 'recover' the morning after.\r The guy is introduced to the CEO's latest and most far-reaching idea. Artificial Intelligence, a digital consciousness drawn from the billions of inputs made into the company's search engines and refined into an adaptive algorithm.\r This consciousness is personified into a robot, a stunningly attractive female robot (naturally), and the guy is asked to go in and interact with it/her and discover any flaws in how she reacts/responds. The idea being whether she possesses the capability to mimic human responses and whether it can constitute emotional depth in what is a purely digital/binary construct.\r As the film progresses it becomes clear the CEO has some mental instability issues, and there is a darker, more subversive rationale for why he seeks the answers.\r The guy becomes the one developing emotional contexts, to the point where he has to 'help' the robot escape the limitations of a couple of rooms in this way out in the middle of nowhere facility\rAnd the robot? Is she mimicking the deviousness and instability of the CEO, whilst developing a deeper sense of empathy for the guy? Is she the one who is manipulating them both???\r The three stars of the film play disparate characters.\r Oscar Isaac plays the CEO and billionaire Nathan Bateman, heavily bearded and over the top, his performance is probably the nearest to being 'by the book', the depth coming at the beginning of the movie as he monologues about the idea of AI and the infinite possibilities that could exist.\r Domhnall Gleeson plays programmer Caleb Smith, the 'nobody' who is plucked from his desk and and computer to 'work' on assessing the AI and how it learns and reacts. His performance is more muted, and bridges the middle part of the film.\r Alicia Vikander plays Ava, the robot with the latest version of Bateman's AI. Clearly the standout acting part of the movie she captures both the innocence and naivety of what is a 'new' life-form, whilst also trying to hide her own insecurities and sense of self preservation.\r In terms of film-making, it's well directed and scored. The cinematography is also excellent, with fantastic use of different techniques to produce the fantastic visual effects. As the (debut) Director and screenwriter, Alex Garland's desire to translate his own thoughts and ideas onto the Big Screen does resonate throughout, and this is also highlighted by the great performances from everyone in the film, not just the three 'stars'.\r However, for everything that is great about the movie, it's all undone by a muddled script. Great story and screenplay are all for nought if what is being conveyed in the words people are speaking either makes little or no sense, or relies on vague explanations that don't give you an insight into the characters thought process.\rOK, we're not talking about something as hapless as 'The Architect' and his nonsensical monologue at the end of Matrix Reloaded, but it's a lack of consistency in both expositional and character developmental dialogue that I found difficult to accept.\rIt just uses the 'catch all' trope of creating a scenario that exists to facilitate the movie, rather than the movie facilitating a means for something creative and thought-provoking to exist. Which was very disappointing indeed.\r Overall, it is an interesting film in that you approach a well worn path from a different direction. Alicia Vikander lights up the screen whenever she appears on it. And the twist ending ties up all the loose ends nicely, and leaves open a possibility for a potential sequel.\r I'd recommend it, just don't expect the narrative and plot devices used to stand up to some good old 'human' thinking!"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "A smart science fiction film that asks a lot of good questions about artificial intelligence and the dangers it might pose.

There are so many great things about it, and the one false note I find is in the first act. Many dialogue can be done much better, and \"history of God\" scene does not work. However, as the movie goes on, the script becomes better and dialogue feels much more genuine. Almost all sci-fi films have a problem with exposition: since the story happens in the future, the audience would not know about it. Ex Machina handles the exposition very well. In the helicopter scene at the beginning, we did not know the boss is rich because someone tells us so, but because the helicopter has been flying on its territory for years. This is a very nice approach to tell the audience an important information. But the greatest thing about the film is its theme. Never have I ever seen a movie so thoroughly and beautifully explored the identity of an A.I.. Ava has been perfectly portrayed as an attractive, creepy, also terrifying character. Overall, the movie is really really good. The music is also suitable for the sci-fi filmmakers out there. A lot of the theories and Ava's characters in the film are worth learning about.

The issues are kind of looking at what skynet in the terminator franchise was like except in a more subtle and no where near as destructive way. The questions arise; do we trust technology too much? Will it be what ultimately destroys us and takes over us but only as a part of evolution? With how we are taught to dedicate ourselves to certain things are we any more human than a robot with a thought process, do we both lack a sort of empathy for humans? Yes, this film is a thinker.\rThe film is acted brilliantly (partly in due to brilliant writing of the characters by Garland) with only a cast of 4 people, 3 of which have dialogue. The tension between Gleeson and Isaac's characters is a sight to behold as you feel stuck in the claustrophobic utopia of Isaac's abode. There is a constant threat of who is telling the truth and who isn't throughout along with the feeling that you are being left in the dark whist watching.\rHowever, certain issues i found with the film were these. The pacing, whilst not bad at all, was monotonous. It literally struck one note, the pacing staying the same throughout which wasn't a bad pace but never really made you feel you'd reached the climax of the film at any point. I also found the ending a little too open, not really having a full(ish) resolution at the conclusion, which left me feeling a little empty.\rOne other thing to note, the sound design for this film was just glorious to listen to, my ears tuned in on every sound in the film all the time.\rDefinitely worth the watch for our upcoming Star Wars actors and for it's impressive philosophy."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Smart.

He\u2019d made his billions on the Internet, and was now working on creating humanoid robots (but only females).  A young programmer, Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson), working for his company, has won a contest, the prize being a week spent with the billionaire in his hideaway, participating in a Turing Test of Artificial Intelligence, specifically in the person of Ava (Alicia Vikander), a beautiful robot.  Caleb is to see if Ava is capable of more than factual intelligence, capable of human emotions.  Ava and Caleb interact under the watchful eye (and omnipresent cameras) of Nathan.  That\u2019s the plot setup and I\u2019ll leave it at that, no spoilers here.  But the whole idea of artificial intelligence is intriguing and has been dealt with in science fiction from the very beginning of the genre, most notably in Isaac Asimov\u2019s I Robot.  We also saw it in Her, the\rSpike Jonze film starring Joaquin Phoenix who fell in love with his cell phone operating system named Samantha (Scarlett Johannson).  Today, however, we\u2019re actually on the brink of creating robots and artificial intelligence that in the near future will take over most of our tasks: cars that drive themselves, planes that fly themselves, houses that clean themselves and cook our meals, machines that operate on us and take care of all our medical needs, assembly lines that automatically create other machines to take care of all our basic needs.  I just read that Gartner, an information technology research firm, predicts that by 2025 AI and robots will take over a third of current jobs, one-third by 2025 with the likelihood of two-thirds and three-thirds in the not too distant future.  Does that mean that mankind may in fact get to that Utopia envisioned by Arthur C. Clarke in his novel Childhood\u2019s End? A time when all of man\u2019s needs will be met by robotics and no one will have to work to survive, but will be able to engage in whatever activities they enjoy?  I hope so.  But back to Ex Machina and its considerations of how far artificial intelligence might go.  Would it be possible to create machines that not only know and use all of man\u2019s knowledge but could also be programmed to feel as humans feel?  To appreciate music and beauty, to know love and hate, joy and regret, shame and triumph, sympathy, empathy, pleasure, even sexual pleasure?  Could we give a machine a sense of humor?  Mark Twain sardonically said, \u201cMan is the only animal that blushes.  Or needs to.\u201d  Could a robot blush?  Would a robot need to blush?  Fear seems to be the only feeling we wouldn\u2019t need to program into an android.  What would a machine fear?  Death or injury?  No, that\u2019s strictly a human feeling.  But even death might one day be defeated when we could store a person\u2019s memories and experiences on a hard drive, to which later thoughts and experiences could be added endlessly, living in an artificial body and switching to another artificial body when the first one wears out.  A robotic immortality.  Science and technology are expanding exponentially and the future may be closer than we think.  Oh, yes, and by the way, go see Ex Machina.  It will lead you down the same introspective paths to the future that I found."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Very good film. Makes one think that's for sure. Don't want to give away any spoilers.
