By comparison, when I saw Wall-e in the theater you could hear a pin drop. I'm giving it a 2 because the animation is descent and there is one funny line when the aliens see the human naked. Otherwise it's a ZERO. AVOID this bore-fest!"

From ages 4-11, this movie was terrible. They wanted to leave the theater, I was falling asleep due to lack of dialogue, and the kids were miserable. They hated sitting there with a movie that didn't have ANY direction. The main character who is a self absorbed fool is so degrading to the title \"astronaut\". It was so bland and unfulfilled, I wanted to apologize to the family for the awful price we paid to sit there and watch this."

      "text": "It's the hubris of man, or rather, the hubris of an American man, who would have the gall to ask Lem(Justin Long) if he's considered \"good-looking\" among his kind. The astronaut can't tell. The inference being, none too subtly, that Captain Baker(Dwayne Johnson) deems the young \"alien\" ugly. Prior to his landing, mankind was rendered in cheesy sci-fi films as a single giant eye, an appropriate metaphor for the narcissism of the homonymic \"I\"(the astronaut). Dissimilar from \"The Eye of the Beholder\"(a 1960 \"Twilight Zone\" episode written by Rod Serling himself), in which a beautiful woman, whose cosmetic surgery goes awry, is considered hideous by the standards of an otherworldly culture, the human species remain the standard bearer of beauty(the astronaut calls them \"sea monkeys\") in \"Planet 51\", despite the context where being tall and Caucasian might be hideous to the short and green. Captain Baker lands not only on another planet, but in another era, as the film documents the moment on our own planet when the hangover of the fifties, still felt, arguably, as late as 1964, finally dissipated, due to the rumblings of an oncoming conflict in Vietnam. There's no war in \"Planet 51\", but there are peace activists(and a protest singer), who insist that the visitor is friendly. The presence of these proto-hippies suggest \"The War of the Worlds\" in reverse could happen, an odd fit for a film that doggedly rehashes \"E.T.\". Well, maybe it might. After all, these planetary denizens wanted to dissect the astronaut's brain. Without any back-up, what choice does Captain Baker have, but to hug Lem like Henry Thomas, as in the finale of the 1982 Steven Spielberg classic. He'll be back and give those misplaced protestors something to protest about."

I went to see it with my 5 years old daughter and she liked it a lot...but I liked it more because I could understand most of the intelligent jokes which the film is literally filled with. From the title (clear reference to Area 51 where the aliens are supposed to be kept secretly by the U.S.), to references to films like Alien, E.T., B series movies (50 feet woman,...), like details in the background (Comics starring a green giant called \"Bulked\" (Hulk)... Despite not being as round as Shrek-1, it clearly has much more attention to detail to make jokes even on the background as the main action is taking place. As said, a good film for kids but even better film for adults with other movies background. Very intelligent."

The film\u2019s script lacks any originality borrowing the loser becomes a hero story that tons of kids movies seem to use saddled with a generic love interest, generic villain, and tons of cardboard cut out characters. Outside of a charming Rover who despite some callbacks to Wall-e is the only charming character in the film with his lack of words and puppy like attitude. Unfortunately, the rest of the film isn\u2019t so charming as it constantly relies on pop culture references, mainly of other sci-fi movies, ranking in at one per minute. The young children who see this movie will probably find it ok although I pity the parents who will be wanting to get inside their car rocket and leave the planet."

My little nephew had no idea about the cultural era defined for the aliens, but he remained mostly interested from start to finish (which, for him, is quite a feat). This is by no means the cream of the animated film crop, but it's a far better experience than many reviews to date would suggest, and it's worth watching. It's a shame I never heard about it until nearly four years after release."

With a poor execution and only two scenes that will make you laugh, Planet 51 is at best to be a direct to video film than a theatrical feature."

If not for the fact that it had a decent premise and that the trailers showed SOME PROMISE, this would've gotten a lower score, but as it is, the film is poorly animated, extremely unfunny, and as a whole, completely unmemorable and painfully dull. I'm telling you now, unless you just watched the film RIGHT NOW or looked it up on Wikipedia, there's no way you'll walk out of this movie knowing any one character's name. There's no way.
