      "rating": "3",
      "text": "Perhaps the worst film I have seen in a long time. Bad enough to prompt me to write my first \"review\". The acting is horrible, thin and dull. The score is abysmal. The photography amateurish and often from illogical angles. I initially turned the film off about 30 minutes in. I then gave it a second chance. It's often best to go with first instincts, especially so in this case. A must miss."
