It's darker and more emotional and dramatic than most superhero movies and I think that fits in well with the Bruce Banner tragic story. Liv Tyler is as angelic as usual and Tim Roth and William Hurt round out a great cast. The action sequences were done really well and I loved all of the little nods to the Hulk lore like the Lou Ferrigno cameo, the purple pants scene, the Stan Lee cameo, and the name of their old time friend \"Stanley\" being a nod to the creator. The plot also developed really well. The only negative was that the fight sequence at the end with abomination was a little anticlimactic. That fight is being hyped up the entire film and I just didn't think it was that great. Nonetheless, this was an outstanding movie and most people would enjoy it."

They needed to do something magic to make up for that and on top of that I didn't expect near the same quality of movie as Iron Man. Walking out of the theater I had an overwhelming sensation that The Incredible Hulk is better then Iron Man. After a nights reflection I stand by that, put simply Hulk > Iron Man [however in not all respects]. While RDJ near perfect role as Tony Stark is marginally better then Edward Norton's Bruce Banner, the Hulk is a far more impressive superhero then Iron Man. The fights in both their scale and frequency blow Iron Man out of the water. For fans of Marvel comics (like myself) the cross-overs just add to the experience. We get two Tony Stark references, subtle references to Captain America, a reference to The Avengers, and a possible set up for the Hulk and Wolverine's encounter at the end. Needless to say Marvel has hit two home runs this summer with movies, if you enjoyed Iron Man, you owe it to yourself to watch this movie, even if only for the 2 min ending featuring Tony Stark."

It finds a superb balance in portraying an angry-man-hating Hulk and also a caring, misunderstood one, although it does lacks a bit of needed dialogue in the early stages mind. However it definitely finishes strong with a top notch fight scene and the CGI graphics actually look great, with the end fight scene itself pretty damn cool and not the repetitive borefest which CGI usually spawns. All the scenes involving Hulk throughout are excellent in fact - no \"it's obviously CGI\" moments - and the film also cleverly intertwines into the plot the way that Hulk goes from being a raging monster, to more of a man-monster. If you can ignore the odd daft bit then you've a fine film to enjoy."

      "text": "The Incredible Hulk is the Hulk reboot which fans have been waiting for. As a relevent part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Edward Norton plays the role of Bruce Banner very well as you can feel the connection between his depression and his constant attempt to control his emotions. Plot: Bruce Banner is a scientist who along with the American army attempts to re-create the super soldier formula that had transformed Steve Rogers into Captain America. The attempt goes haywire when he becomes so confident in it that he injects himself and becomes the rage filled Incredible Hulk. While hiding out in the favelas of Brazil, he contacts a mysterious source known as Mr. Blue in an attempt to find an antidote toward his unwanted transformation. In the meantime he struggles to control his anger to avoid causing innocent casualties and waking up confused and naked. Meanwhile the General Ross (William Hurt) of the US army attempts to capture Banner in an attempt to use him as a weapon. To do this however he hires an elite soldier Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) who is ecstatic to capture Banner and will go to extremes in order to do this. Comparison to Hulk: This movie includes much of the same plot but is much more linear and realistic. Instead of unrealistic scenerios, The Incredible Hulk immerses audiences with its top notch CGI the seriousness of its military forces and its incredible ending. Opinion: One of the best superhero movies that really show audiences what Hulk is all about. Anyone who is interested in a realistic live action Hulk should totally view this movie, also anyone interested in the Marvel Cinematic Universe should check this one out."

      "text": "What could have easily been a mediocre and all-too-familiar origin story turned out a really fulfilling cinematic experience thanks to straight-up good filmmaking. This film is objectively better from a technical standpoint than its predecessor, Iron Man. Cinematography is done artfully and carefully with lots of attention to pleasing compositions and meaningful movement and framing. The locations, environments, lighting, and weather are all used to great effect to give mood to the film's various situations and arcs. The score by Craig Armstrong, one of my favorite film composers, enriched each scene with appropriate energy and emotion. The performances of the main cast were convincing. I really felt the connections between the characters and the emotions of the characters. For a film that's relatively light on story, it really makes up with it with pleasing characters, visuals, and action. The action scenes were thrilling and handled particularly well, much more fun to watch than the action scenes in Iron Man, as these are more carefully planned and coreographed, with some truly surprise moments. I found there were moments of sheer awe and horror in the brutality of The Hulk and his fights with the menacing villains. I was even kind of surprised to see later parts of the film take on the feeling of a monster movie, evoking feelings of Godzilla, Cloverfield, and others of that genre. It worked very well and helped us feel the surrounding characters' fear of the \"monster\" they'd created in Bruce Banner. Great movie. I'd watch it again. It has a few weaknesses, namely every moment involving Mr. Blue, who gave a rather grating performance. There are a few moments that feel rushed, or forced, or cheesy, but all-in-all for such a simple story this film worked really well for me. I'm sad to see Ed Norton didn't keep the role, because I highly prefer him to Mark Ruffalo for this character."

      "text": "What seemed, in theory, the least-necessary revival of a bigscreen superhero emerges as perfectly solid summer action fare in \u201cThe Incredible Hulk.\u201d Revisiting the character Ang Lee and James Schamus put under a psychological microscope in 2003 to mixed results, Marvel, Universal and several of the same producers have repackaged one of their better-known stable stars in a straightforward actioner that delivers the goods with no unnecessary frills or digressions. Happy to give the intended audience what it wants, this loud and quick-moving production will shake loose ample coin in all markets.\r To anyone wondering why the Marvel team would so soon embark on a makeover of the growly green giant after all the angst endured on the previous one, the answer is provided by the final scene, in which the star of the most recent Marvel B.O. smash unexpectedly turns up to ask, \u201cWhat if I told you we were getting a team together?\u201d\r New film thus marks the first step in the label\u2019s plan to begin shuffling its major characters into films together, a la some of the comicbooks \u2014 a scheme that seemingly required the rehabilitation of the Hulk from something that came to be regarded as perhaps too rarefied, not of a piece with the studio\u2019s other cinematic stalwarts.\r Viewed in this utilitarian light, the new film gets its job done. It\u2019s not especially exciting or surprising, lacking the cheek and sheen of \u201cIron Man\u201d and the opulence and star power of the \u201cSpider-Man\u201d and \u201cX-Men\u201d series. But it\u2019s better than the \u201cFantastic Four\u201d pictures and \u201cDaredevil\u201d and manages to shift the title character from a hopelessly conflicted Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde to a wannabe good guy.\r It seems that none of these Marvel-based films can begin with anything other than a medical experiment gone madly awry, leaving its subject with a drastically split personality. This one gets it over with pronto, after which scientist Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) hides out anonymously in a Brazilian favela while desperately trying to decontaminate his blood, eliminating the cells that can make him, if sufficiently incensed, turn into a raging, bemuscled, 9-foot screamer with disagreeably antisocial habits.\r Keen to track Bruce down is Army Gen. Thaddeus \u201cThunderbolt\u201d Ross (a cigar-chomping William Hurt), who oversaw the experiment. He wants to bend the results to military purposes and sends mad-dog soldier Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) flying down to Rio to snatch the elusive fugitive. Resulting pursuit is a partially parkour-style chase through the pinched passageways and across the roofs of the hillside slums that entertainingly recalls but doesn\u2019t nearly match the flair of the opening sequence of \u201cCasino Royale.\u201d The Hulk makes his first kick-butt appearance in Brazil 23 minutes in, but is only partly seen, and in shadows at that.\r Despite the manpower expended to bring him to heel, Bruce is able to make his way back to Virginia, stopping en route in Mexico to buy a pair of stretchy pants, which he rightly predicts will prove useful down the line. In the intervening six months or so, g.f. Betty (Liv Tyler), old Thunderbolt\u2019s daughter, has taken up with a new guy, but she immediately drops him when her old flame reappears with major issues to deal with.\r First and foremost, her dad wants to extract whatever\u2019s inside him to augment the Pentagon\u2019s arsenal (there\u2019s no discussion of whether or not this super-steroid constitutes a chemical weapon). Second, Blonsky, who admires his adversary as \u201ca whole new level of weird,\u201d can\u2019t wait to attain that level himself. After he volunteers to receive a dose, he\u2019s able to compete with the Hulk up to a point in an explosive battle on a university campus lawn, but he\u2019ll need more juice to have any hope of besting the green one in a street brawl.\r Which is exactly what the showdown consists of. Following an interlude in which the Hulk takes Betty to what looks just like King Kong\u2019s cave, both he and Blonsky enlist the services of an enthusiastic research doctor (Tim Blake Nelson in an amusingly over-the-top turn) to become battle-ready. With Blonsky transformed into a creature fully justified in being called the Abomination, they proceed, ripped and roaring, to lay waste to Harlem; that the finale would seem to be almost entirely a CGI-animated sequence will be noticed but not much minded.\r Norton gives indications of perhaps wanting to go places with the role that remain off-limits this time around (he no doubt would have been happy teaming with Lee), but he\u2019s kept largely on the straight-and-narrow, to decent effect. Tyler is no more or less memorable in the femme lead than Jennifer Connelly was in \u201cHulk,\u201d while both Roth and Hurt happily underplay by a bit what might have been expected of them in their villainous roles."

This film has gotten some flack for not being as good as one of the best films in the Marvel franchise but it is still a good movie in its own right. One ingenious thing about this film is that since it is a reboot of the previous Hulk film, they put the origin of the character in the opening credits which is something that I hope they do with the new Spider man movies since people are well aware of his origin. Edward Norton gives a compelling performance as both the Hulk and as Bruce Banner. The actor who plays General Ross fits his role perfectly as the no- nonsense military general. The story is what you would expect from the Hulk since it is about him running away from the military while fighting the Abomination played by Tim Roth. The final action scene was once again very entertaining with the protagonist fighting a darker reflection of him self. Unfortunately there are still some problems with this film that holds it back from making a great film instead of a good film. For instance although Tim Roth was an intimating villain his turn to evil wasnt really that convincing. At first it seems that he only wants to fight the Hulk because its his mission but than he turns evil in a snap because of the formula. There was also some buildup to a potential villain (either the Leader or Gargoyle) which never went  anywhere and it will never be explored in any of the other Marvel movies. Betty Ross was also a bland love -interest. She is good at being the emotional support for Bruce Banner but I really didn't care for her safety that much. Despite those glaring problems though it is worth a watch especially for that POV shot when Banner tries to kill himself and later turns into the Hulk to spit out the bullet."

And that\u2019s where we had \u201cThe Incredible Hulk\u201d,a movie that promised us a new version of the Hulk (and a refresher from 2003\u2026 Ok,I\u2019ll stop).But if we\u2019re going to see if it\u2019s any good or not 10 years later (kind of astounding how it held up by itself,honestly),let\u2019s see if it still holds up or not.So,the story. To understand the story,technically you\u2019ll have to see the 2003 Hulk movie by Ang Lee (I guess,which if you don\u2019t want to,glad they retell that for the new viewers in the title sequence) to get some explanations of what\u2019s going on in the beginning of the movie (when we\u2019re introduced to Bruce Banner\u2019s life),but,cutting that flaw out,the rest is interesting to look at. We understand why Bruce Banner (played by Edward Norton) is having a troubled life with the military,his love for Betty Ross (played by Liv Tyler) and his anger/excitement issues that lead him to becoming the Hulk,as the title says. Even if in the end,he realizes that no matter what he does,the city still needs him,even if he\u2019ll SMASH his way through everything.Speaking of that,at the same time,in the 3rd act,we\u2019ll get introduced to the villain,Abomination (played by Tim Roth),where I\u2019m kind of mixed. Look,his actions are not really understandable: He\u2019s a Professional Soldier,he gets angry after he got beaten by a kick from Hulk,then he gets crazy and crazy as the movie progresses,him and his creepy CG\u2019d out body (he gets the Super-Soldier serum,so that\u2019ll better explain something\u2026),then he becomes the Abomination just so he can kick Hulk\u2019s butt. It\u2019s not horrible,but it feels like the writers saw a Videogame Rage Compilation and thought \u201cWhat if the angry player gets his revenge on him,and actually wins?\u201d to just get away with it. Back to Bruce Banner, his relation with Betty is really sweet and Edward Norton plays a \u201cscared,always on the lookout\u201d Bruce Banner expertly.Tim Roth is intimidating as Abomination and Liv Tyler was basically \u2018Jennifer Connelly from Hulk 2003\u2019 2.0,since her lines are told in this weird,coff-y and muted tone,and a scene involving a Taxi Driver driving like if it\u2019s a Car Chase (that was outta nowhere\u2026). That,and the scene where Hulk throws a rock through the storm to defend Betty cracks a laugh for me. Sorry,but it\u2019s just me.Now,for the Special Effects...as of today,they look like the perfect Nintendo Switch videogame,ported by Panic Button. But,for 2008 standards,this felt serviceable. The action was fast and frenetic,and the Motion Capture was nice.And yeah,the score is still another \u201cMarvel Score where you\u2019ll remember the theme and its action cues\u201d,but it\u2019s one of the better ones,being composed by Craig Armstrong (he also composed The Great Gatsby).So in the end,I think The Incredible Hulk is an underrated MCU Movie that fans don\u2019t necessarily have to go see now. Maybe for a fun time. And hey,it being a Universal movie from 2008 was kinda surprising since it has better qualities in it than Cash World Fallen Profit."

Tyler doesn't really fit into the role. Her charisma comes more naively over and the prehistory with Bruce Banner, one does not look at her. Also General Ross was now taken over by William Hurt. Like his predecessor Sam Elliott, Hurt also has a good screen presence and costs it completely. The main opponent is Emil Blonsky this time and is played by Tim Roth. Although Roth is motivated by his role, and he also sees that he is buckling, he also seems a bit stunted. One could have afforded more freedom for Roth.The director's post took over this time Louis Letterier. Letterier relies more on action and effects than on figure drawings. His predecessor Ang Lee had rather told it as a romantic comic book fairy tale. Although Lee was rather lengthy in his history, Letterier is rather superficial. My favorite scene is when Hulk hits Blunsky for the second time. Blunsky says dry: Is that all? And you can see that in this version a bit: Is that all? Was that all? Conclusion: Better a few effects less to work out the screenplay better!"

The casting roll seems a bit weak at first but you will get used to it. It is of course better than the first Hulk movie released few years prior to this one"

Sadly, I think the Ang Lee version of Hulk , killed this movie's appeal somewhat at the box office. Production values are high and it follows the source fairly well. Under rated in my opinion."

But today I've watched it again and my impressions are more positive than last time. I think it's an OK Hulk movie for 2008. It holds up decently in 2021. Edward Norton did a good job. Tom Roth also plays a fairly decent villain. I've seen worse.And it's just really interesting to think how this and Iron Man kick-started the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe."

It goes out of its own way for fan service and clich\u00e9s that fall flat. At least it's atrocious to the point it's funny at times, which is the only saving grace of this... abomination."

Edward Norton is Bruce Banner a scientist whose experiment fails and he becomes a violent green mutant. This film's special effects are amazing and Norton delivers better acting than Eric Bana in the 2003 movie. The Incredible Hulk has strong emotion, awesome action and breathtaking visual effects. The cameos by Stan Lee and Robert Downey Jr are funny and effective. This film is also a step up for The Avengers. The story is excellent and Liv Tyler rocks. This is one of the best, smashingly great films of the year. Thanks to director- Louis Letterer, the Hulk has more comic based fun and less boring action as Ang Lee's Hulk. Awesome, Epic and Humongous fun- The Incredible Hulk is breathtaking."

I did like the end fight I just don't like Abomination in the movie sadly all round an underrated MCU movie I wish we had this hulk and Bruce Banner in the MCU movies sadly we don't still have an underrated movie so I give The Incredible Hulk an A-"
