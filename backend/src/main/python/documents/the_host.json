      "text": "It is often difficult to identify with foreign films as we don't \"get\" the inside stuff. This film was done throughout the 1950's on small budgets. Yet there were believable monsters or forces and the characters dealt with them almost the way we think we would have. There also were many \"monster\" films that spent no attention to detail, poorly developed characters, inept dialogue, and maybe a political statement or some pathos thrown in. We have the latter here.The acting is at times silly and then serious. Why does the monster kidnap people? A snack later? And the bad government including the U.S. made to look inept. If the film takes place in the present there is technology that could have easily found the monster and destroyed it. Oh yeah, couldn't because of the virus.Why critics have chosen to heap praise on this is beyond my understanding. It seems like the makers of the film tried but it just doesn't play to American sensibilities. I fast forwarded through most of it. Not impressed with the monster or the humans. But maybe that's just my American perspective. It got raves in Korea. For these reasons I rate it a U for unratable or maybe unwatchable. You want to see a good foreign monster movie, try Big Man Japan."

Why does the monster only eat certain people that are not crucial to the plot? Why does chemical gas only affect people who are not crucial to the plot? Why is it that a full-frontal lobotomy does absolutely nothing to a person's brain function? (well, you guessed it... he's crucial to the plot.) The creature effects are kinda cool, but the creature doesn't seem to have any definition, we're not really sure about anything about this creature except for that it only eats/kills people half of the time, and it is really quiet (even though it's huge, it can sneak up on people without making a sound). I didn't even mention the terrible translations in the subtitles. \"He's always B-minus, not A-positive! Don't give him a hard time!\" WTH? This movie had some potential, but it's a senseless, frustrating mess with way too many holes. Avoid, avoid, avoid."

So when i saw this movie at blockbuster, i decided \"why not? everyone says its a good movie\" so i rented it, little did i know that i was being lured into the biggest crap-fest that i have ever seen in my life. For  starters, the plot really made no sense at all, I mean, why would toxic acid turn a fish into a giant monster?, and if so, then how come only ONE fish was affected by the acid, when there's at least a couple hundred fish in the lake. Secondly, the acting was laughable and couldn't fool a four year old, and quite frankly, neither could the \"monster\". Lastly, the dubbing, I really hated how this was a Korean movie and was meant to STAY in Korea but some idiot decided to translate it to English so they could bring this garbage film over to America, and the dubbing sucked so bad, i ,mean when the people were done talking , their mouths were still moving. this movie sucked, bottom line, and if you want to see a GOOD monster film then i recommend \"the mist\""

      "text": "Uneven acting by the lead actor(Kang-Ho Song), or rather, acting that's more appropriate for a comedy, sets the wrong tone for a film purported to scare us senseless. Arguably, the monster's appearance arrives too early in the film, but its descent from the bridge and splash is awe-inspiring and will lead an audience to silence. \"The Host\" doesn't truly begin until the oldest son loses his childish persona and comes of age. His daughter is held hostage in a sewer(at least King Kong wasn't a pedophile), and it's here \"The Host\" starts to work. The monster does something that belongs in the annals of grossness. Now we're a little scared. This creature stops being a CGI effect and is transformed into something on par with Gollum, a fictive body that seems to be living and breathing on its own terms. But what's truly striking about \"The Host\" is the film's willingness to kill off major characters. Apparenly, who dies in a South Korean event film is less predictable. And unlike many American event films, the final showdown against the menace is intricate and exciting."

The acting is all over the place - take one instance when the family is mourning over the loss of the little girl (the hinging factor of the movie), and all of the actors transition instantly from mourning to just plain silliness, making the entire sequence ineffective. The monster itself, as awesome as it looks, doesn't even feel like a threat most of the time, which is a result of both bad writing and bad sound editing - bad writing because the entire city doesn't seem to worry about a colossal river creature eating and stealing humans, and bad sound editing because every time an action sequence begins, the volume of the soundtrack and effects drop significantly, which really kills the intensity of those moments."

Unfortunately the movie does not live up to its billing. To have compared this movie to \"Jaws\", as one critic did, is a total and misleading overreaction. \"The Host\" has a couple of thrilling moments, but it isn't thrilling. It has a few funny moments, but it isn't a funny. And it has a few scary moments, but the it just isn't scary. I'll have to admit that the movie had me on the edge of my seat, but that was only because I was anxious to leave.
