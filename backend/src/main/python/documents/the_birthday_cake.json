      "rating": "7",
      "text": "Very enjoyable and tense thriller. I loved the tempo of the movie and the central character Gio was very well acted. It's no classic but it delivers as a well thought out and emotionally charged thriller. Kudos to Shiloh Fernandez. Some of the scores here are ridiculous, zero is not a score so don't listen to those experts, give this movie a go, worth the admission price!"
