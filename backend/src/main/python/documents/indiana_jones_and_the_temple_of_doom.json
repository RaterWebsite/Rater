      "text": "Lucas and Spielberg botched the second installment, 1984's Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom. After a great opening in a Shanghai nightclub, Ford lands in a remote Indian outpost where a revived Thuggee cult engages in slavery and human sacrifice. Temple suffers considerably for working on a less ambitious scale, saddling Ford with a shrill heroine (Kate Capshaw, stepping in for the vastly more appealing Karen Allen) and engaging in the worst kind of exoticism. (Foreigners are weird, backward, and dangerous, and they eat gross food.) But the clumsy attempts at darkness are what really spoil the fun. All the shots of emaciated children laboring away under threat of death make Temple feel less like a Raiders sequel than a warm-up for Schindler's List."

It was intentionally darker, but Lucas was going through a divorce and and accident during a Spielberg movie killed an actor, and yet people don't take enough time to actually watch it, instead of bashing it. Yes, it was darker, and the heart scene was too much, but it was a great movie otherwise. Definitely watch it! Classic. I unashamedly love this film.The three main characters represent every level of the audience. 1. Indy - the hero we all want to be. 2. Short Round - the person we most likely are and 3. Willy Scott - the person we really dont want to be. This is why the comedy aspect of the movie works so well. Supreme adventure film. Dont take it too seriously. I dont understand all the hate for the movie in India - sure there were Indian bad guys in the Thugee cult but there were lots of Indian good guys too. Good and evil exists in any country or culture."

The biggest is without doubt the actors. Jonathan Ke Quan and Kate Capshaw are both non-fitting actors for their role. Jonathan is a really bad actor, he totally ruined the movie. Some of the dialogs are forced and the chemistry is a bit vague at some places. The opening scene is slow but great, and the movie is overall really funny and entertaining. It also got great cinematography and the classic music is spectacular! But it's not as great as the previous movie, and the major reason is the plot. It's not as adventurous or entertaining, but it's still a great movie!\r A less impressive sequel.\r 7/10"

      "text": "The only nice thing about this film is seeing Harrison Ford in his Indy costume while still in his prime.  The rest of the film is a dark, noisy mess.  It is easily the weakest entry of the sequels to Raiders of the Lost Ark.  The character of Willie Scott was about as deadly to the film as Jar-Jar Binks was to Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.  She's given tons of screen time to whine, scream, and complain about just about everything around her.  The mcguffin of \"Magic Rocks\" was weak too.  Following the Ark of the Covenant, it would have been better to go with the Holy Grail instead and worry about a Mcguffin  for Indy 3 later.  Perhaps a fan edit could undo much of the damage by cutting Willie's scenes by about half, but I know of no such fan edit.  As it stands, it is a dark ugly mess.  As an over-correction, Indy3  was too cutesy by half; which is why I thought the balance applied to Crystal Skull was just about right...even though the Mcguffin there was weak too.  My guess is that Indy5 will be more like Bond, and have Indy fighting over a conventional menace instead of an ancient mystical one."

      "text": "It's a fun movie but there was too much action once they're in the temple and it's in that dark setting for so long, \"Willie\" was so awful (completely helpless, constantly nagging and screaming, materialistic (\"OMG diamonds!!!!\"), even that odd choice of a name for her), and it veers too far from reality (the first film felt like it could all really happen, sort of, with some limited supernatural elements until the end). The child slavery was unsettling. Sure, stuff like that has happened in human history, maybe not exactly like this, but was it necessary to see children getting abused and so much? I didn't like the cheap gross out scenes in the first film and for some reason they decided to do a lot more of them for this one, just really don't see the point. The audio, at least the version on Netflix, is really imbalanced and too low so it is very hard to hear the dialogue and I tried tweaking the sound settings a lot and had the volume at almost double what I needed for the first film. Lucas and Spielberg admitted they messed this one up due both of them going through divorces around the time it was being made. I'd give this film a 5 or possibly 6 but some people do not know how to give criticism and blindly rate stuff 5/5 or 10/10, which really gives a misleading average score."

      "text": "In this film, the second in Indiana Jones franchise, the famous explorer goes to India, where he will face a strange and dangerous cult that kidnaps children in a nearby village of their temple. Directed by Steven Spielberg, this prequel to the first film has script by Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz, and keeps Harrison Ford in the title role.See this movie and compare it with the first of the franchise makes you want to ask Spielberg what the hell went wrong. After a film as interesting as \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" (which revealed some flaws, but had a very own charm), this one is a real cold shower. Kate Capshaw is a perfect casting error, never managing to overcome the mediocrity. Harrison Ford, although don't embarrassed his character, also doesn't appeared to be properly inspired, making his role without much emotion. For posterity, however, are the scenes of the banquet in the palace, who can start sonorous laughter from any audience. The script is not necessarily interesting, missing movement, the action is very concentrated only in certain sequences. The photograph is bad and boring, colors are too loaded, especially red tones, which is not good, although the visual effects have won an Oscar. The costumes are well imagined and some scenarios as well but the soundtrack brings no surprises or novelties.People say that there is no love like the first, and this is true in the movies: after a movie like \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" was very hard not to disappoint the audience, but it would have been easier to please with a smarter script, a more vivid and adventurous story, a less forced photograph and a main actress better and less noisy."

      "text": "\"Dr. Jones, I am an Asian child stereotype!\"-Short Round, probablyOh look at the ritualistic satanic foreigners who have some kind of mystic and magical power! Oh look at the dumb bimbo blonde who breaks her nails and shrieks at everything! Racist, insensitive, and sexist, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom still remains a terrific little adventure film. With fun action scenes, banter, and a charismatic turn from Harrison Ford, Temple of Doom may be a lot darker and more violent than even Steven Spielberg liked, but it is still a very campy and fun film that delivers all of the Indiana Jones spills and thrills anticipated courtesy of great action set pieces and his iconic lasso.What is always striking about the Indiana Jones films is that they are both compelling romps through archaeological legends and rip roaring good times nonetheless. While the archaeology is hardly a focus of the films, the mythology always is and Spielberg continuously delivers compelling and fun mythology. Here, the film is set in India with a magic rock missing that is being used by a Kali worshipping occult group that sacrifices people to honor Kali. Sent in to find the magic rocks and put a stop to this group of weirdos, Dr. Jones faces some considerable pushback from this demonic underworld while running about with Asian child sidekick Short Round (Jonathan Ke Quan) and blonde bimbo Willie (Kate Capshaw). While the film's beats are hardly different from Raiders of the Lost Ark in this prequel, the film's fun energy and blending of this mythology with excellent action set pieces consistently sets this one apart from other dumb blockbusters with half-hearted mythology that never lends itself to the action. Instead, the mythology and legend of the film is always given room to breathe and is always given the time of day instead of being squandered by focusing solely on the action. As a result, it is a blockbuster with a fun and unique plot that has great action instead of a hollow piece of trash that is just action with no substance whatsoever.That is not to say the film is not flawed, nonetheless. While dripping with historical mythology, the film does still get a bit too wrapped up in the action as it reaches the end of the second act. From the point where Indy drinks to the blood to when they get off the bridge, the film barrels full speed towards its climax and falling action with reckless abandon. The set pieces are all very nice, but just become too much to become far too long. While the scenes all serve a purpose, they just go on for far too long and for a non-action junkie, though the scenes are truly excellent pieces of filmmaking, it just felt like Spielberg opted to ditch that aforementioned strength in focusing evenly on action and mythology in the name of just going balls to the wall with action scenes. It is a sadly hollow result, no matter how nice they look (aside from the severely dated special effects on the bridge that are hysterical, especially when that chief demon heart ripper out guy hits the mountain).The film's flaws continue to its various cultural issues both in the stereotypical comic relief antics of the young Short Round, but perhaps the worst is Willie. A blonde bimbo who worries about breaking her nails, the character smacks of Spielberg having just watched Alien and thinking, \"Ha! Women could never do that.\" Though he is hardly a misogynistic filmmaker, the character of Willie is certainly one of his worst with her just there to provide cleavage and comedy about how useless women are in \"manly\" situations. She screams when it will reveal their position, is too weak to get on elephants like young boys can do easily, she freaks out with bugs, and has to be shown how to do literally anything. Oh and she also is just there to flirt with Indy and use suggestive innuendo. Charming character, to say the least. The writing is hardly the reason to see this film, but this piece was just above and beyond terrible.Fun, action-packed, and excellently anchored by Harrison Ford, the Temple of Doom may be a stepback from Raiders of the Lost Ark, but it is a good film nonetheless. That said, I do miss everybody from the original film and wish this were not a prequel, even if the Nazis would have needed to be involved in this film (as Spielberg makes it sound, if it were a sequel). Rather offensive to Hindus and women alike, the film is otherwise harmless fun with excellent blockbuster filmmaking by Spielberg with fun and inventive set pieces, smart mythology, and the perfect establishment of stakes to give this one considerable weight. Though imperfect, Temple of Doom is nonetheless another fun Indiana Jones film."

Then it's of to India where doctor Jones, the female night club singer Willie and little Short Round meet a village with desperate people who had their children taken from them. Next there is some comic relief again: the banquet with a lot of strange foods and also the very funny scene in the catacombs with the insects scattered allover the floor (\"It's not cookies doctor Jones!\") After that Jones and his friends go in a temple where a secret cult is torturing people, ripping their hearts out of their chest and trowing them in hot lava.\r This constant changing of atmosphere can bring some confusion and can even make the viewer feel uncomfortable if he takes it all too serious. Maybe it's best not to do that and just enjoy the wild ride. And a very wild ride it is!\r I rate this movie slightly lower than the first one, 9 out of 10."

      "text": "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was released in 1984 and was directed by Steven Spielberg. It is the sequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark and the second instalment in the Indiana Jones series.Something that you may not know is that this film is a prequel to the first film. The only thing in the film that points this out is when it states the year at the start of the film (this one is 1935, Raiders is 1936). Other than that, there's nothing really that says that this is a prequel and it's just something I wanted to point out.I appreciate this film for being entirely different to Raiders which makes a refreshingly new experience and with a story pattern not used previously, it makes the story less predictable and therefore more exciting.Harrison Ford is still great as Indiana Jones and is as charismatic and heroic as he was in the first film. Other characters along for the ride are Willie Scott and the little kid Short Round. At first, Willie may seem quite irritating as she's constantly screaming and complaining but if you think about it that's how someone who'd never experienced these situations before would probably react. Also, towards the end of the film she seems to help a lot more which is good to see as it shows how her character has developed.Short Round is easy to love and he's quite a good character; intelligent in thinking and with no fear, much like Indy himself. His acting can seem quite unrealistic at times but he was played by a child so you can kind of let it pass and also I think it's above standards for a child actor. You can see how these characters don't have the best of relationships at first but as the film progresses their relationships grow and it's great to see them all working together in the final act.This film does have quite a dark tone to it, so dark that it contributed to the creation of a new rating: PG-13. There are things in it such as monkey brains, eyeball soup, snakes being cut open, heart being ripped out and child abuse (don't worry, none of these are as graphic as they sound). To be honest, comparing the content in this film to the original, it's not that much darker. It is certainly darker than the original but definitely not as dark as some people make it out to be.The sets in this film are great and all feel authentic. The practical effects are also still great, especially the heart scene. However, some of the green-screen isn't particularly good like in the original but it's something that doesn't appear much thankfully.There aren't really many notable action scenes in this movie; in Raiders pretty much every action scene is memorable, however the only one that really stood out to me in this film was the final bridge fight.As I began watching the film, I wasn't sure whether I was going to like it or not because not as much was as investing as the original but as the film progressed it certainly got better and the final 20 minutes are great to watch.Overall, this is a nice change from what we received in the original and is an enjoyable watch. It does have a darker tone than the original but when comparing it to the original it's not too bad. This movie is definitely not as good as Raiders but is still a very good movie and I would recommend giving it a watch.7.8/10"

During this period of golden age film making, there were a lot of experiments at mixing comedy with violence/horror while still trying to make it family friendly. Such a result can be seen here. It is an extremely gorey film, yet its targeted at children to an extent. It's disgustingly dishonest and pulls itself apart so inelegantly.Couple with an incredibly weak (yet well acted) annoyance of a female lead, a child who seems more fitting to be the 2nd main, and you have probably the most mismatched protagonists of any action movie.The only saving graces are the lavishly detailed sets and vibrant colours, with some acceptable action sequences. But growing up and reflecting on what was made all those years ago; looking at what you could get away with, Temple of Doom doesn't deserve the praise it gets, for its guilty of just being too unsophisticated and unintelligent."

The plot is garbage, and revolves around Indiana Jones helping a Hindhu tribe get their magic stone back.

Instead of playing it save with a more of the same sequel they tried some new things. It is chronological the first movie and a bit more grim and darker. After again an intense introduction I wont spoil Indianan Jones, his (eleven year old) sidekick Short Round and American singer Wilhemina Scott crashed in India. Here they will experience a dark and intense adventure. Many people hear that it is the weakest movie and expect an awful disaster and are surprised afterwards how good it was. I just repeat myself it is a really good movie that is weaker than Raiders of the lost Arc which is by all standards one of the most acclaimed and cherished movies of all times. Storywise it fully delivers. I cant remember many boring moments and it has some really intense and memorable scenes. The action scenes are also well done and are breathtaking. There is the complaint that it is too dark by many and that it has no humor. While I see the validity of the first argument I think it is not too dark and it delivers and intense atmosphere and immersion. For the humor I think that is a wrong statement. There are many humorous scene that often come up in discussions for the movies. Lets talk about the strong cast. Harrison Ford delivers again a great performance as Indianan Jones. However I think that Jonathan Ke Quan as Short Rounds made an even better performance. He is the hidden star of the movie and became a favorite character, Lets talk about Kate Capshaw as Wilhelmina (Willie) Scott. I know that many think that I dislike her character and start a rant. However it is the opposite. She gave a great performance and delivered. Many find her annoying but that is her role. It is a trope or stereotype and she nailed it. I recently discovered that this movie hurt her career and I am sorry for this. Then there is Amrish Puri as Mola Ram. He is a great antagonist and so intimidating that it will give you nightmares. One of the most underrated villains in movie history and on a side-note winner of many best villain awards. This movie has a great cast and I see no real flaws here. I want also praise the sets and visuals. Everything looks great and realistic (=as you expect it to look). They nailed the temples, jungle and mines. I read that they wanted to film in India but after some difficulties filmed in Sri Lanka. Visually and stylish there is also not much to criticize. It creates or helps to create the atmosphere and immersion. Then there is of cause again the legend himself John Williams who is one of the best film music composers of all times. Again a great soundtrack as expected. Overall this is a great movie and without Raiders of the lost Arc it would be appreciated more. While I agree it was the weakest of the trilogy it is still remarkable. Look at Kingdom of the Crystal Skull how a terrible Indianan Jones movie looks like."

      "text": "On its own it is a fun yarn, but compared to the brilliant Raiders of the Lost Ark it is a disappointment. The story is rather overblown and not as well thought out, Kate Capshaw's shrill and annoying heroine is one of the least engaging characters in the series and the character of Short Round didn't do much for me either. However, the sets and cinematography once again are fabulous, as is the score. The script has some nice touches, the direction is good and the pacing is brisk. There is also some terrific action especially the wild roller-coaster ride through the Indian Mine, and Harrison Ford is still very engaging as Indy. On the whole, disappointing but it is still pretty decent. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

      "text": "Though not a terrible movie, Temple of Doom is certainly a tier below Raiders of the Lost Ark. There's plenty of comic moments and entertaining action sequences, but overall the film is bogged down by weak side characters, glaring stereotypes, and the unrelenting darkness of the tone."

      "text": "An interesting and exciting adventure, marred by ridiculous violence and darkness (although I'm no longer as bothered by that as I used to be).  Like the other movies in the series, it has something of a historical basis (emphasis on the word \"something\" - LOL), although this one is probably more accurate than the others.  Many condemn it as racist, sexist, etc.  That's ridiculous.  (And condemning it for condemning idol worship is also ridiculous.)"
