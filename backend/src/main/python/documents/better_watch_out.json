Roger Corman said once that rule #1 is to have a good script, and this one is excellent. This movie was a real surprise.  It steadily ratchets up tension little by little like a pressure cooker. It was very well photographed, the lighting and color pallette were extremely well organized. The camera is always in exactly the right spot, moving when it should, the way it should.  The performances were all very effective, a real accomplishment considering the age and experience level of everyone involved.  All in all I was really impressed by this thrilling little movie."

      "text": "This movie is legit terrifying. Like, I felt actual fear just reviews of the movie after the fact. The entire thing is elaborately set up and the horror aspects fit perfect in with the themes its trying to push. The whole thing is really well put together, with the humor and the serious bits never undoing one or the other. The fear that you feel with the idea that the **** kid might actually get away with it is possibly the most tense and fearful moment in the movie for me watching it. I felt real scared that they were going to go that way, and for the leading lady as well. Seriously, this movie shocked me with how good it was. I went in expecting a normal holiday slasher. Effective twist, effective story, and great acting from pretty much everyone. To be fair, I went into this movie completely blind and without expectations, which may be where a lot of disappointment is coming from. Still, this movie stands strong on its own, and the notion of your primary disappointment coming from the idea that you were expecting something different is possibly the dumbest thing I've ever heard."

      "text": "This is a high-calibre accomplishment. New Yorker once praised Stephen King's genius as evident in his ability to make unbelievable stories believable. And this is what happens here. And by doing that, in an original story and formulation, we are faced with a brave depiction of our psychology.. as the characters transcend into psychological constructs in each of us. And facing our own so vividly is truly horrifying."

      "text": "Surprising, goes against cliches in a way that made me enjoy the ride. Acting was great from everyone and the main characters are developed enough to make you care. Can't say much about the story without spoilers but some people won't find some events believable which will make this movie divisive. While the story as a whole is well thought of, there are a couple of plot holes that can't be overlook. Didn't stop me from loving the movie a lot though. I'll see it again next Halloween for sure."

And also please watch this movie without watching the trailer first or reading too much about it,the twist is really big and you will be shocked if you dont know too much about it."

      "text": "It's been a while since a movie's made me feel physically ill, to the point where I wish this movie came with a warning- \"Viewers must like torture porn & deplorable characters\". I love horror and sinister characters, but I'm having a hard time thinking of anyone finishing this movie and saying 'Wow, that was a BLAST!'. It's not. It was hard to sit through, and it only sunk lower. Filmmakers have a choice to consider their audience, and even if a story is told well: Is it WORTH telling? Is there comeuppance? The blow at the end of the movie that leaves audiences with a sense of satisfaction? In the case of Better Watch Out, no, there isn't."
