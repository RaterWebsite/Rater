      "text": "JordanRossReviews: WHAT HAPPENED TO MONDAY - 5.2/10Rating: NR | Family Friendly: No. 18+ | How to Watch: Netflix\"Had a lot of potential and a few good moments, but fell on its face tripped by its own mistakes.\"With such a relevant topic as overpopulation the story of What Happened to Monday had my attention from the beginning. Disappointingly it slowly lost it from there. I really began to get distracted by questions which never seemed to get answered. The film starts with Terrence Settman (Willem Dafoe) \u2013 the grandfather \u2013 deciding to raise all seven septuplets in a futuristic world where it\u2019s illegal to have siblings. The earth has undergone catastrophic events in the likes of global warming and overpopulation. In an effort to fix these issues the Child Allocation Bureau was created and ran to maintain a one child per family law.I was immediately impressed by the performance of Noomi Rapace as The Settman Sibilings. Each sibling with her own personality and look played by the same actress cannot be easy to pull off. Noomi\u2019s portrayal of each was believable, but there were times where the most noticeable differences between them was their wardrobe. I enjoyed seeing the personalities of each sister, but it was an inevitability that some would stand out more than others. The writers Max Botkin and Kerry Williamson had me wanting to ask if there was a real reason to have seven siblings other than naming them after the days of the week. Decisions like these that ignored obvious issues is what plagued this film the most.The moments where the film shined the most were the scenes we saw the relationship between the seven girls and their grandfather Terrence. The lengths that he went to in order to ensure their safety and own self-preservation were admirable and touching. Willem Dafoe brought a strong performance when he could, but another mistake was the under-use of his character in the whole of the plot. However I did appreciate how the extremes of the families\u2019 situation were never underplayed and really showed through the eyes of their grandfather\u2019s role as their mentor. Where this film bombed and really couldn\u2019t come back from was the plethora of plot holes. If it wasn\u2019t for this review being a non-spoiler I could list ten plus moments that had me questioning, is this possible? From technology to just characters simply not noticing the obvious, it felt the writers were simply ignoring these issues and assuming the audience would never notice. The film\u2019s runtime was two hours and three minutes and I would have gladly watched another ten or fifteen minutes of explanations to solve most of these issues. Overall I felt this film had a lot of potential and a few good moments, but fell on its face tripped by its own mistakes. Compared to Tommy Wirkola\u2019s (Director) other works this was a step up, but clearly he has room to improve. The futuristic setting was believable, but the cinematography was nothing to call home about. Acting was good enough to keep you immersed, but the script had obvious issues that removed you from the world. In the end What Happened to Monday satisfied my sci-fi itch but left me scratching my head."

Plot, structure, dialogue,LOGIC, however, were apparently left on the cutting room floor. The story is nonsensical with enormous plot holes that the director and writers either didn't perceive or did not believe audiences were astute enough to notice. Extremely poor effort by all (except for Rapace who did the best that she was allowed to when working from such poorly written and conceived material)."

      "text": "A flamboyant film by Netflix that showed a very interesting subject, which it definitively holds, unfortunately it gets lost very soon, victim of its own inability to create a more cohesive and fast-paced narrative, because with a hundred and twenty three minutes of length this movie has some extra thirty useless minutes where something more dynamic could had been achieved, especially because the film only has two action sequences when it could be done much more, especially if you take into account that the movie makes a terrible narrative mistake in one of them by stopping all the action in order to give space to another sequence that while necessary it completely messed up what was happening at the moment.The work of Noomi Rapace is excellent playing seven characters, but although while she manages to give them its distinctive features comes a point in which none of the sisters seems different, I do not say that is her fault because the situations of the script compel her to it.Also is sad to see Willem Dafoe and Glenn Close being so underappreciated and wasted but I think that for their careers it's already a plus to keep working.I did not like the ending because practically when they explain the reason why everything happened, it feels somewhat artificial considering the selfishness of Monday who planned to sacrifice the lives of her six sisters for the two that would make her a mother.Although the film never points to it because in the end it criminalizes it, it is very true the argument branch of the enormous over-population that is happening worldwide and nobody is doing anything to stop it.It is true that the film was not obliged to deal with the subject but should not have abandoned it so easily.It's not a bad movie, I think it will mostly entertain you, it will not be memorable but at least it was not a failure."

To watch an actress who has skill and talent in playing multiple versions of herself...and who has the ability to make each character interesting - check out Orphan Black and the amazing Tatiana Maslany.  I wanted to check out the movie due to its premise of a one child bureaucratic dystopia.  Years ago, I read an amazing novel by Barry B. Longyear entitled Sea of Glass that creates a believable and terrifying dystopia around this premise and the life of an \"illegal\" child. - much better than this movie as I still remember it 20 years after I first read it - I will have forgotten this movie by next week.  Check out the book for a better story. Check out  Orphan Black for the acting.  Forget this dud."

I'd normally say wait for Netflix, but as this is a Netflix Original, then I'd recommend watching the entire Netflix catalogue prior.    It's a shame that a film with strong production values was green-lighted with such a weak script.    This film aims to disappoint and succeeds."

I really like Noomi Rapace and since her character from Prometheus was killed of in the sequel (the Covenant \"masterpiece\") has started a renewal of the interest in her movies (seen almost). Of course the grade is more for her not the movie, as it was not awful for what was, a relative cheap almost straight to video thriller. Of course it has plot holes and cliches, but look at the director (2 zombie nazi movies and one about adult Hansel and Gretel fighting who knows what) and 2 almost anonymous writers. It did not promise anything and I feel that it delivered on a few things. Maybe you could have guessed that Monday betrayed the rest of the sisters but could you have known why. And the end is it really a happy one, as without the killing of the siblings the problem of population will resurface with a vengeance. So please judge if you will but I enjoyed this."

      "text": "HUGE SPOILERS. NOTHING BUT SPOILERS. Okay so obviously the whole \"overpopulation-dystopia with reduced childbirth\" scenario is pretty cliche at this point, but for a second there it seemed like this could maybe go in some interesting directions. It could make a lot of the same points that we usually see (i.e. dont **** up the planet dumbasses) and also have an interesting twist of discussing family and identity, and what it would be like to have your only chance to interact with the outside world be a lie. That is a very interesting premise. However, the main thing that makes this dystopian thriller a bit different (i.e. the kids aren't just hidden in a closet, they each get to go out one day a week and the challenges that they face because of it) is barely addressed. Within the first ten minutes, Monday is gone and we have to go right into killing off sisters. I guess the ending wasn't really that bad, but it was hard to appreciate it since it basically felt random as to which sisters survived and basically the whole \"message\" (if there was one) really felt flat because nothing was really developed enough. It didn't make much of a larger ecological / political point because in the end, they just abolished the one-child policy and didn't really make any kind of effort to fix anything. Like these siblings are just gunna die of starvation, you guys didn't actually save the world. And it didn't make any kind of interesting points about family or individuality because the sisters didn't have enough time to really become distinct because they were dying so fast. When a few of them died, I didn't even really know which one they were. Anyway. It's not the worst film I've ever seen, but it really didn't do anything original and didn't have much of a point other than being a gore-fest."

This movie's story was really welcomed and it's not a happy ending. And you don't really know who's the bad and who's the good. They all want to help in their own way. Considering that the movie was a action adventure/ crime /semi-futuristic the visual effect could have been a lot better. The sound effects are really lousy some times as well. The acting could have also use some polish as well. I'ts not really that immersive. But the switch shots are really good.
