      "text": "A nice suspenseful movie by Alfred Hitchcock. This tale about a cheating wife and her husband with a plan to kill her has been remade in 1998 under the title A Perfect Murder with Michael Douglas. Both films are very good and have a beautiful leading lady: Grace Kelly and Gwyneth Paltrow."

      "text": "Dial M for Murder depicts the carrying out and consequences of a husband's perfect murder scheme. The dialogue is fast-paced, witty and excellently delivered by the entire cast. This is fortunate because Dial M for Murder is a very dialogue-heavy film. It pulls you in, and though the climax occurs early you are kept guessing as to how events will turn out until the very end. By no means is this  finest film but it is still brilliant in its own right."

      "text": "Alfred Hitchcock is a wonderful director, directing classics such as Psycho, North by Northwest and Rebecca. While not his best, Dial M For Murder has so much to recommend it. First of all, is the breathtaking cinematography, which is nearly always the best thing in a Hitchcock film. The script is a gem, showing that you are capable of anything, and most of the time, it is very tense and rarely slips. That said, my only complaint, is that one or two scenes such as the ending do fall flat, compared to the rest of the film. However, the film also has a wonderful music score, and fantastic performances from the entire cast. Ray Milland, an actor I really want to get more familiar with, is excellent as Tony Wendice, the husband planning to murder his wife, and make it a perfect murder. As Margot, the beautiful Grace Kelly is the picture of beauty and vulnerability in a wonderful understated performance, perhaps outshining her co-star. Everyone else acquitted themselves well too, even Robert Cummings as Mark Halliday and John Williams as Inspector Hubbard. Overall, an excellent film, not Hitchcock's best, but well looking out for. 9/10 Bethany Cox."

Du reste, les aberrations du sc\u00e9nario ne sont certainement pas en reste, car on tombe dessus assez souvent sans crier gare dans ce crime tr\u00e8s imparfait...Sans mentionner bien entendu Grace, la douce Grace qui se d\u00e9brouille tr\u00e8s bien avec le malotru et m\u00eame en supposant qu'elle soit tomb\u00e9e sur le cave des caves, l\u00e0 encore, on nous prend bien pour des jambons...Cela \u00e9tant dit, on ne s'ennuie pas le moins du monde dans ce film du Ma\u00eetre, ce qui nous en bouche s\u00e9rieusement un coin, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 le passif du bonhomme dans son domaine, c'est-\u00e0-dire le domaine de l'ennui et du baillement. Bravo au Ma\u00eetre donc qui a su nous tenir \u00e9veill\u00e9 du d\u00e9but \u00e0 la fin. La musique y participe \u00e9galement, elle qui est tr\u00e8s \u00e9nerv\u00e9e pour un oui ou pour un non et qui nous a peu \u00e9nerv\u00e9 aussi, nous devons l'avouer.Plut\u00f4t distrayant et assez int\u00e9ressant, le film se prend donc les pieds dans le tapis \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises avec en point d'orgue cette fin qui confine \u00e0 un certain ridicule pour ne pas dire un ridicule certain. Mais un film moyen du Ma\u00eetre est certainement d\u00e9j\u00e0 un chef-d'oeuvre en soi, car tout est tr\u00e8s relatif dans sa filmographie habituellement \u00e9pouvantable."

      "text": "What is told repetitively, what is romanticized, what is pure, is the final trick.Dial M For MurderAlfred Hitchcock is a great adapter. From books to plays, his adaptation is simply ingenious. And maybe, only because he never lets it lose the essence of where it comes from. What the source is. Which then of course can be argued as both an advantage or a disastrous disadvantage. And Dial M For Murder suffers the same consequences that Rope does. The play is written with very few scenes in mind. Scenes with long conversations in mind and long conversation that swoops in every behind the stage activity occurring both before and after the sequence. It can be a bit cheesy, fortunately it is not here.And this is how Hitchcock dodges all the social rigmarole that a structure of this film comes with. More than 90% of the film is staged in one set piece only. The hall, the main room, the entrance room of this murderous apartment. So why do we despite knowing all these issues that are about to come, still fall for its topsy turvy script. Only because, Hitchcock frames exactly what the audience is going through. That is why he is still loved. Even decades later, his films are satisfying.Walking in on the murder mystery film, every audience member appoints itself to be the detective of the case, the film. And what all it, the audience, wants to do is analyse every last detail of that crime scene. And Hitchcock gives them exactly what they want. Split into three acts, the first act is the planning of that crime scene. The second is the crime scene going wrong just as it was planned and was to be narrated to the executioners. And the third is justifying the wrong doers deed. And it is a finale in the sense that we aren't told how this will go down unlike the previous acts."

      "text": "This film tells the story of Tony and Margot Wendice. She's married, but ends up having an affair with Mark Halliday, an American writer of detective novels. Therefore, and to avoid giving up her fortune, Tom decides to murder her but his plan goes wrong and Margo kills, in self-defense, the man who would kill her. Tom, to avoid the risk of being discovered, quickly creates a plan to take his wife to be sentenced to death.Directed by the great Alfred Hitchcock (one of the most brilliant directors of all time), this film, like others he directed (\"Rear Window,\" \"Psycho\", \"The Rope\" etc.), is based on a police investigation, and the dramatic tension of the plot resides in its development, putting the audience in expectation, waiting to see when the killer will be unmasked in their eagerness to try to save himself. That's a formula that Hitchcock used so often in his movies that it's difficult today to see this movie and don't feel that disappointment of those who expected something more, or something different. Nevertheless, this movie is good, is very well done and has a great cast (headed by Grace Kelly, Ray Milland and Robert Cummings, respectively in the role of Margot, Tony and Mark Halliday) toasting the audience with great interpretations. The technical aspects (photography, soundtrack etc.) also seems faultless.\"Dial M for Murder\" is a film that already has a few years, and probably we've already seen it on the small screen. Despite this, and despite not being one of the best films of this director and being totally unable to cause us astonishment or surprise, it's a nice movie to see, or review."

He made movies which were ahead of it's time including this one.This movie had everything a crime mystery drama should have. It was nicely made. The direction, performances by the actors, story.... everything was good. There is thrill and suspense till the end. Movie tries to confuse you due to which you are unable to predict the ending.There were some things that I didn't like about the movie. First, movie started in uneven manner. It takes time to figure out what is happening. Second, the conclusion part was little bit confusing to understand. Other than that it's a good watch.Overall, it is a good crime drama thriller which will keep you bounded till the end."
