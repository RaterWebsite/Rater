Once you are happy with your review, press Confirm to submit it.Currently 5/5 Stars. \u00c2\u00a0 | Dan#17I remember seeing this movie many times during it's summer 1988 theatrical release. I was much impressed and agreed it was deserving of it's critical rave reviews. Rarely does a film present such a sophisticated mix of style, technique, imagination and originality. The concept was simple: combine live action with animation, which was already done before, not so convincingly. Here's a case where the sum truly is greater than it's parts. A rather ordinary live action film is combined with traditional cell animation, in ways that were never seen before in cinema. These many individual techniques already existed, however no one took the time or trouble to put them all together before this film. Besides the realism of the live action and animated world interacting with each other, this film represented another historic first. It was the first time well known classic cartoon characters such as from Disney, Warner Brothers and other studios ever appeared together in a film. This was to be the last time Mel Blanc supplied the voices for so many famous and beloved Warner Brothers cartoon characters, such as Bugs Bunny. This is truly an inspired film in many ways. Unique, highly entertaining, influential and amazing, for children and adults of all ages. Masterfully done."

      "text": "I see no reason not to like this film, it's uproariously funny, with plenty of memorable scenes and quotes to keep you going for ages. Each and every character are suited to their roles, perfectly picked, as a film, you have to have a particular set of actors and actresses to play certain people, or voice cartoon people and animals, otherwise your film will dramatically flop at the box office. You can see here that the production crew did not fail to call on the best of the people in order to create the classic movie of all sorts.Unlike many more modern films where a hybrid of live-action and animation is created, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is one of the best types of these films where the interactions between the live people and the cartoons and accuracy of positioning cartoons in the right place are realistic, and you can actually see relationships developing between real life people and cartoons. Who Framed Roger Rabbit is certainly fine art, in particularly the finest, as well as being funny, there is always a darkness beneath, in the form of Judge Doom, which is played with amazing precision by Christopher Lloyd. It does so without ruining the atmosphere, as some films always fail to combine darkness and laughter in the certain amount of time.This film is for everyone - who says its for kids only? Of course there are innuendos and threats which goes over kids heads, but it has a certain something which makes it for everyone. I was 16 when I first watched it, and I loved it."

The characters are great, the gags and reveals are hysterical, and there are some really touching moments. Robert Zemeckis masterfully directed this film, and it's honestly some of his best work. A couple of the jokes and references don't really hold up, and a couple scenes are grating at times, but other than that, this is a great movie."

      "text": "This is one of the best movies that combine both animation and real life. It's spectacular how realistic the interactions between them are, because it draws attention away from the fact that the cartoons are just ink, pen and pencil and aren't actually there. Normally I felt upset that the woman who voiced Jessica Rabbit was left uncredited, but she still did a brilliant job; and the whole cast did the same of keeping up the pace of the movie. I'm certain the voices of especially Eddie Valiant, Roger Rabbit and Judge Doom couldn't have gone to anyone else because I couldn't help but experience the emotions (especially of laughter but also amazingly merges fear and chills down the back of your spine; mostly when Judge Doom was on the screen) that you're supposed to experience in this sort of movie. And Gilbert's right, this movie is FUN. Especially the mystery you get to unravel along the way."

      "text": "Who Framed Roger Rabbit perfected the combination of animation and live-action together into a full length feature film that was amazing for its time and still amazing today. Talents like Bob Hopkins (Eddie Valiant) and Christopher Lloyd (Judge Doom) talking to animated characters on the screen (or nothing/ manikins on set while the film was in production) were performed fantastically that became believable to the viewer's eye. The film contains a variety of comedy, action and drama all presented well with such memorable and iconic characters for all audiences to enjoy. The film may have some innuendos and content that are not suitable for the younger ones, but the movie does hide those really well for the children to not catch on. Who Framed Roger Rabbit is an inspiring film for animators and filmmakers alike and shows that cartoons aren't just around this world to entertain children only. For someone who watched this movie countless of times, Who Framed Roger Rabbit receives a perfect 10 from me."

      "text": "While this must have been an outstanding achievement back in its day, it feels much a bit outdated now. Especially that this is the first time for me watching this movie. The humor feels kinda stale, and so does the effects (but that is understandable of course). The story is clever, though not so \"touching\" as many claim it to be. However, what truly stands the test of time is the concept itself. The idea of mixing live-action with animation is quite brilliant and works on many levels. Another great idea was mixing the the characters of rival animation studios together, although it didn't play a big part in the movie overall. In summation, a good movie, but i wish i could have watched this in my childhood. Would have appreciated it a lot more."

Beyond its historical significance as the first film where animated and live-action characters share the screen at the same time, the movie is just too entertaining: it's funny, it's got memorable characters, very clever visual gags, great fanservice (when else do you get to see Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny on screen at the same time?), and some really solid dialogue (\"I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way\" is still an iconic line). Sure, some elements are a bit underdeveloped to me (how are humans and toons co-existing together?), and I'm still trying to figure out how this got away with a PG rating, but all in all, \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" is a great example of a historically-significant film that also happens to remain very entertaining."

The live action with the animation was perfectly blended, and I was howling with laughter at the beginning. The story is perfect, about a rabbit framed for a murder, when he suspects his wife of cheating on him. Bob Hoskins was brilliant as the melancholy drunk private eye, while Christopher Lloyd has great fun as the very scary villain. I would never have guessed the ending in a million years, totally unpredictable, and quite scary too. The real stars were the toons. Some of the funniest scenes were with them, like Eddie in ToonTown, and the weasels were a blast. reminded me of the Untouchables, actually. I didn't know for ages, that Kathaleen Turner voiced Jessica Rabbit, wow that woman is beautiful. Turner voiced Jessica brilliantly. in conclusion, a hugely satisfying part animated comedy, that both kids and adults will love. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

For the late 80s, not everyone could shoot this, and Robert Zemeckis, who was at the peak of popularity, also directed. Who Framed Roger Rabbit is both comedy and detective and even partly noir. In this film, everyone will find something they are interested in. The plot of this children's film, everything is banal and simple, there is no intrigue that is inherent in neo-noir films. Who Framed Roger Rabbit is definitely worth watching for children, the film can be an excellent example for acquaintance with adult cinema, I advise everyone to watch."

      "text": "In this film, the iconic Roger Rabbit is charged with murder and will have to resort to a human detective who hates cartoons to prove his innocence. Directed by Robert Zemeckis and written by Jeffrey Price, the film features performances by Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd, as well as the voices of Charles Fleischer and Lou Hirsch.This film did something that, until then, was extremely rare: put human actors interacting with animated characters. And this was done with quality and a welcome realism. I excused to say, I believe, that the cartoons are the strong dish of the film, as well as the countless comic situations they star in. Bob Haskins shone in his role, skillfully balancing a comic character who maintains, throughout most of the film, a serious and even grumpy attitude. Of course, his most angry phrases eventually turn him into something even funnier. Christopher Lloyd comes late but in excellent performance, as villain. Cold as ice, insensitive to no end, he gave life to a memorable character with personality traits worthy of a Nazi executioner. Among the cartoons, Roger Rabbit and his sculptural wife, Jessica, deserve all the highlight.This is a family film that will easily appeal to all ages. The bright colors of the cartoons are appealing, contrasting with the more serious environment of the \"real world\" and flesh and blood actors. The special, visual and sound effects are excellent. The costumes are good and help the public to locate the story around the forties. The soundtrack is good and the music sung by Jessica, a jazz classic \"Why don't You Do Right\", is memorable."

Also, I loved the chemistry which Roger Rabbit (Charles Fleischer) and Eddie (Bob Hoskins) have throughout this movie, I thought it was very well built up and their characters are very well developed throughout this movie. Finally, the villain who is called Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd) is honestly a fantastically dark villain from start to finish which I really liked. Overall, it's a brilliant movie. It's a movie which I'd not like to see a reboot of because I think it wont be as good as this one was. Also, I liked seeing the different animated cartoon characters throughout this movie swearing at each other especially the part with Donald Duck and Daffy Duck, that's honestly class."

Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a comedy, a noir film, and a detective story all rolled into one. Everyone will be able to find something to like in this movie. There is no intrigue present in this children's movie's narrative, which is bland and straightforward. Neo-noir movies often have intrigue. Children should see Who Framed Roger Rabbit because it might serve as a great introduction to adult filmmaking. I heartily recommend it to everyone."
