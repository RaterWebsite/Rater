As a morality play, the film wavers between ambivalently observing and downright smirking at the questionable actions of the characters at large, an approach that doesn't exactly line up symmetrically with the more stern and cautionary final act. How are we supposed to feel about these characters? I at least felt certain of this at the end of the film, but throughout? Not sure. The performances are all quite good, with Constance Wu and Jennifer Lopez among the standouts. I honestly wish I had more to say with this one, but I really don't think I was given that much else to discuss."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "The movie was ok. Nothing special.

Jennifer Lopez (Ramona) is accomplished in one of the two lead roles, I've previously enjoyed her in 2013's 'Parker'; which is the better film, but individually she's best here for sure. Credit also to Constance Wu (Destiny).Solidly told story, a few decent song choices in there too. All in all, it's a pleasant film to watch.

Jennifer Lopez delivers a bravura performance truly worthy of a Best Supporting Actress nomination at the Oscars. Her Ramona is charismatic, nuanced, scheming, funny, suave, and motherly all at once; though largely an ensemble piece, Lopez\u2019s performance truly ties the entire film together \u2014 from her dazzling entrance to her final line."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I enjoyed the movie. Pleasantly surprised at its candid view of their lives.

Similar to the film, we, the clients, are robbed shamingly. But what's interesting is that the film loses at the end of the day. Not even looking at the intentions of the film, the film, as a story, had an extremely solid argument to walk through that Oscars table head held high. And instead the opportunity is not only missed but chucked away for cheap thrills and manipulative emotional blackmail. And this could have been a worthy Oscars contender and is instead just an Oscars contender.And I emphasize on how big a mistake they made, on going light on this material. What the film industry, in the last few years, had twisted and turned its way out to address the political correctness, is something that the film has in its pocket all along. So now, all they had to do was carve a compelling drama. And instead they are overcooking those same ingredients, that turns into a preaching to the choir tone, within the first act.The film craves for such moments. If anything it goes all the way around, just to create memorable scenarios, to the price of pacing. And it is not the pace I have an issue with, it is the two page script that is told magnanimously within two hours that I can't just \"whoooooo\" around. The film is also hard to watch. Not for the justification it attempts to give its characters but also the justification that it doesn't give to its characters. And it is not the narrative but the visualization of that crime scene that makes it horrible. For if told properly and rummaged around the files, dug deep into their homework, you will find a sweet spot to explore that would balance these Hustlers."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Sooooooooo bad.

It left me wanting to do something more -- like warning people, even those I don't particularly like, not to waste their money on it. Critics who had anything good to say about it should be barred from the profession, and moviegoers who liked it should not be allowed to bring children into the world. One critic called this Jennifer Lopez' best performance in years. That's like saying Showgirls was Elizabeth Berkley at her best. How bad does a film have to be before you walk out on it even though there are a lot of hot, busty women in short skirts? See this film and you'll find out. It is beneath contempt."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "This is wrong people praising things like this as female empowerment.

The acting performances are stellar, particularly Jennifer Lopez, who delivers one of her best performances in years. However, something about the pacing and story just feels empty.

That's all I really ask of any film.  This one's also interesting because it's a true story.  Acting is okay, nothing stellar.  Constance Wu has too many tiny-tears scenes where she's staring into space and you can almost see the eyedropper dripping the water on her face.  Quite a few good laughs though.They should have left out the frequently-vomiting girl.  Added nothing whatsoever.  When will screenwriters realize that puking is NOT FUNNY?

There's no real crisis, there's not much at stake, and Constance Wu is utterly ill-equipped to carry the film as the lead.  I loved her in Crazy Rich Asians, but she doesn't do much for his hollowed-out story.  I hadn't realized that this was based on a newspaper article, but it makes perfect sense.  It's light-weight.

Constance Wu plays the new girl who's taken under the tutelage of the accomplished mastermind (Jennifer Lopez, introduced via an amazing dance number and looking fantastic throughout). At first, things are all fun and director Lorene Scafaria has captured the carefree repartee and lively lifestyle with a natural energy. Although there's too much time spent on the party aspects, once matters gets serious, the drama develops adequately. Anyone expecting hot chicks on the pole will enjoy the first 30 minutes, but there's more to be appreciated in watching the relationships that develop and the machinations of their crime."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Beautiful work from writer-director Lorene Scafaria. A valentine to female friendship and a condemnation of an engendered capitalist system. Wu and Lopez are phenomenal in fully rendered, dimensional parts. There are no heroes in this film - as well there shouldn't be. But Wu and Lopez craft their characters with tremendous humanity, equal parts empathy and frailty. Scafaria rightly depicts the victim's perspective of the events that unfolded too but doesn't condemn her characters for it - as there is a larger, more antagonistic, more pervasive economic system to which they ALL fall victim."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "very good casting  and performing; music was good, political references were great."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "This movie can't hold a candle to the Magic Mike's movies , it's absolute trash , no story , no climax , just pole dancers and bad writting.

Constance Wu may be the lead actress in #Hustlers, but it's Jennifer Lopez who shines through (especially at 50 years of age).The key issue about 'Hustlers' that's still being discussed is whether or not the movie condones the \"Robin Hood-esque\" actions/crimes perpetrated by this opportunistic group of ladies. I personally wasn't bothered by it. The film ultimately felt ambivalent to their crimes.

Where does all this come from? Watching \"Hustlers\" I thought of Lopez making a big splash in the movies when she starred opposite George Clooney in \"Out of  Sight\" and Beyonce doing the same when she co-starred in the movie \"Dreamgirls\" and neither did any more movies worthwhile.Chita became a star playing Anita in \"West Side Story\" on Broadway and Rita won an Oscar for the same role in the movies. Chita would remain a big and much loved star on Broadway for the next 60 years while Rita became a star on television.In any case, thinking about the 4 women was a diversion from looking at a movie that, while certainly glorifying a woman's body, shows smart women 'taking' dumb rich men. It sort of looks like in spite of all having sad backgrounds, most being uneducated, what choice did women have except for pleasuring men whether stripping or giving them lap dancers while other men took most of the money they made.This all takes place before the 2008 recession when men threw money around as if it wasn't theirs and in most cases it wasn't but then that recession came along and the women team up together to fleece the wealthy clients they still have, making thousands of dollars knowing the men are either married or would be too humiliated to report them to the police or still had enough money not to worry about.After Lopez's fantastic entrance doing a pole dance I lost interest in the rest of the movie possibly because the story of rich men being taken is so common place in South Florida that it seems to be in the paper and on television at least once a month if not once a week.The performances, by Lopez especially, are all good while the direction by Lorene Scafaria keeps the movie going but her screenplay, based on a  2015 magazine story by Jessica Pressler, gets tiresome very quickly.\"Hustlers\" is getting good reviews including talk about Lopez getting an Oscar nomination but I would rather see a 'duel' between her and Knowles or, even better, between Moreno and Rivera!"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "A very entertaining movie that has a fresh and interesting perspective into the world of hustlers.
