Justin Theroux fills the spot of Chris Meloni quite nicely.  Rudd is amazing, as usual. It was great seeing Ian Michael Black, Wain, and Michael Showalter in their brief appearances.  Hopefully this film will further broaden Wain's appeal (esp after Role Models) so he can make an even edgier and funnier film like The Ten in the near future.  Experimental humor needs a strong comeback. And this is just troupe to do it."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd play a New York couple that ends up living in a Georgia commune loaded with mildly wacky characters. Needless to say, there's plenty of humor at the expense of new age/hippie notions and the duo's comedy chops provide plenty of laughs. There were moments when I wished I could have rewound a few seconds to catch some of the more subtle or quick lines. Overall, the film's not outstanding or ground-breaking, but it's an amusing diversion, especially if you enjoy Aniston or Rudd."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Just what I expected from a David Wain movie. A simple story where reality is just that out of the norm, a lot of funny bits through out the movie and just an enjoyable experience all together. If you liked his previous movies you should be good with this one."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Writer director David Wain (WET HOT AMERICAN SUMMER, ROLE MODELS) once again teams up with Paul Rudd to deliver a hilariously offbeat comedy in WANDERLUST. Rudd stars as George, an overworked Manhattan business type who has just moved into an incredibly expensive apartment with his wife, Linda (Jennifer Aniston). Unfortunately, tragedy strikes just as they're finally beginning to settle in - Linda fails to sell her documentary to the executives at HBO, and George finds himself unemployed when the feds swoop in and shut down the company he works for. Unable to afford their big-city lifestyle, they pack up their belongings and head south to live with George's brother, Rick (Ken Marino). Along the way, they find themselves at Elysium, an \"intentional community\" of free spirits where Bluetooth headsets and business meetings are replaced by hallucinogenic drugs and impromptu acoustic jam sessions. George and Linda are captivated by their colorful new acquaintances, and after a bizarre series of circumstances, the Manhattan couple begins settling into a lifestyle they never imagined. Most of the humor is derived from George and Linda's interaction with the residents of Elysium, including Wayne (Joe Lo Truglio), a budding novelist (and nudist); Seth (Justin Theroux), the alpha male who has been detached from modern society for entirely too long; Eva (Malin Akerman), the flirty young blonde that wants to teach George all about free love; and Carvin (Alan Alda), the aging, irritable patriarch of the group. There's also a scene-stealing performance from Michaela Watkins as a bored Atlanta housewife that features some of the film's most quotable dialogue. While WANDERLUST is paced well and contains plenty of hilarious moments, there are a few scenes that could've used some tightening up, particularly a lengthy monologue during which George practices his seduction techniques in the mirror. Paul Rudd is an incredibly talented comedic actor, but not talented enough to keep this scene, and the one that follows, from being anything but painfully awkward and embarrassing. This complaint is minor, however, when you consider how consistently funny WANDERLUST manages to be. Wain has knocked it out of the park with this one, delivering a quirky, original film that is unlike any comedy you've seen before, and contains more laughs than I've had in a long time. --www.nerdrep.com"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Wow I wasn't expecting much and loved this movie. Wall to wall laughs, Rudd was hysterical, Aniston surprised me - she fit right in with this amazing cast.  And the story moved me...it's a real wish-fulfillment fantasy that we all have about throwing it all away and trying out a new life.  But most of all it was one after another of funny scenes with the two stars mixing it up with Alan Alda, Malin Akerman (who's also so sexy), Justin Theroux, Joe Lo Truglio, etc, etc. Going to see it again this weekend."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Definitely worth seeing just for the sheer fact of poking fun at the hippie, rainbow coliation lifestyle. \"money buys nothing\" great line which sums up the philosophy of these free love, non working hippies and a good opposite depiction of extreme other lifestyle where money is everything. The most i've laughed out loud in a movie in awhile and mostly from the supporting cast not Rudd or Anitson. More movies could be made disussing the topic of dumb hippie philosophy as well as the equally obsessed gold diggers who will stop at nothing to aquire cash no matter who they hurt along the way."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "This movie is both predictable and unfunny. Although I had one or two laughs while watching it, I watched the majority of this movie with a raised eyebrow. It misses the mark on almost every occasion.

In better films, it's less bothersome, but here, it becomes clear that the premise has worn thin, and it's time for the movie to wind itself down.  Furthermore, George and Linda are little more than caricatures, and the story is little more than a clothesline on which to hang sketch comedy.    The good news:  the sketch comedy of Wanderlust, the film's raison d' etre, is quite good.  It has an oddball, goofy sense of humor, and most of the gags hit their mark.  I don't laugh easily.  I laughed a lot in Wanderlust.  As a story, it is flawed, very flawed, but Wanderlust is still funny, and that's what you're there to do in a movie like this.

The film's only sense of support is from Rudd, who continues to posses a naturally occuring, acquiescent benevolence about him that is very much commendable. Contrarily, though, the film is pretentiously vulgar, laden with flopping, full-frontal nudity, and slovenly ribald humor. The result, presented satirically, is a 98 minute uncensored, extended-cut SNL skit that thinks its funnier than it actually is; what it \"is,\" being complete hokum."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "This movie has lots of duds and the hits aren't satisfying enough to make up for it.

Then you saw the funny parts.  I didn't know who I was supposed to care about during the movie.  And then about, 3/4 of the way through, they seemed to remember that movies generally have an antagonist and wrote that in.  Not one of the characters had any depth, and most of them were so unbelievable (even for a comedy like this) that I could never lose myself in the moments."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Bad humor, bad acting, bad plot. I imagine the laughing that people heard was from the audience laughing at how bad the jokes were. You know that laugh you laugh because something is just so unbelievably dumb."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Seated at a table in the wee hours of some Las Vegas casino coffee shop, David Howard bemoans the fact that his wife has just lost their \"nest egg\", comparing the situation to a Twilight Zone episode, a hypothetical one where Linda gambles away their life savings on 22, the number she bets compulsively on at the roulette wheel. Now their life is really like Easy Rider, Winnebago notwithstanding, because the yuppies are flat broke. The once-consummate power couple, who dropped out of society to find themselves, can't find any hippies, let alone, a commune, in Lost in America, but instead, resides at a trailer park inhabited by aging pensioners. Linda informs David that while combing Safford Court, she discovered a \"sweet little creek\" at road's end, and if it was 1967(and not 1986), that creek would have been teeming with skinny-dipping \"flower children\", and as for the \"garden three doors down\", nothing stronger than carrots, nothing with medicinal or recreational purposes, probably rules that patch, as David overhears an elderly gent outside their trailer home worrying about the sight in his right eye. In vain, Linda tries to play the part of the free spirit, but the husband, better than his wife, realizes that their time to be bohemians has passed. Ironically, the only Easy Rider fan that they encounter is an antithetical one; a motorcycle cop. Loosely folowing the template laid down by the Albert Brooks film, George and Linda, in Wanderlust, go underground, but their foray into oblivion isn't premeditated as was the Howards. Like The Twlight Zone, the NYC couple's excursion into uncharted territory occurs through the luck of sheer happenstance, when the weary travelers, en route to Atlanta where George's obnoxious brother lives(due to the double whammy of HBO passing on Linda's penguin snuff film and the feds raiding the office that employed her husband), stop at a bed and breakfast which turns out to be a hippie commune. Movie references abound at Elysium, in particular, \"Together\", the 2000 Swedish film about a likeminded collective, with the main difference being the time appropriateness of such a utopia, just barely though, since the film takes place in Stockholm circa 1975, a transitional period for most idealists, stateside, that is, but David, to his great consternation, missed out on the counterculture, whining to his boss, \"I used to make fun of my friends in college who went out to find themselves,\" choosing instead the business route. Eight years later, eight lost years, in David's estimation, would place his hiring at the company he's just been fired from, around the mid-seventies. Easy Rider(1969), the film that inspires David's male menopausal-inspired journey, perhaps, made its trans-Atlantic debut late, hitting the Swedish moviehouse circuit at a time when the rebel film about resisting authority had already gestated in the minds of many young Americans, who were by that time, embracing free enterprise, not free love. Unlike the Howards, George and Linda can't afford a $450,000 house; they can't even afford to make the payments on a recently purchased micro-loft, which is commentary in itself, through the juxtaposition of the booming eighties with our current recessionary times. Wanderlust is a luxury for the Howards; for George and Linda, wanderlust is a matter of survival. As if mirroring their accidental lives, the car overturns, putting the stranded couple in contact with Kathy, the desk clerk, who knows how to say, \"Good evening,\" in Swedish, and makes a dated Beatles joke in relation to George's name(\"...where're John, Paul and Ringo?\"), thereby creating an estrangement effect, in which not only time gets manipulated, but moreover, place, since this direct reference to the Lukas Moodyson film transforms the commune(alluded to as an \"intentional community\" beforehand) into an intentional Sweden. Despite the lack of a theoretical framework that explicitly spells out the political rhetoric of this nonconformist society, it's not hard to image a celebration breaking out when Ronald Reagan died, similar to the one in Together, when Goran, Tillsammans founder, learns about Francisco Franco's passing over the radio, setting off pandemonium in the tiny household after he relays the good news. After all, Reagan once was quoted as saying that \"fascism was really the basis for the new deal\" in 1976. While George plays \"Two Princes\" at an impromptu front porch hootenanny, the moviegoer can interpret The Spin Doctors as a code for the rhythm guitarist's conservatism. Seth, representing socialism, outduels George, putting capitalism in its place. But Seth's virtuosoship lays bare his fraudulence. He doesn't share the spotlight; he hogs it, in which the guitar solo acts as a power metaphor. Seth is phallocentric, as most hippies are, whereas Goran seems more middle-class than a late-sixties refugee. He demands monogamy out of Lena."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "A very funny movie, but one that is kind of lacking.

The gag reel near the end is by far the best part of the movie (aside from a scene involving a stampede of nudists in slow-motion) and I can't help wishing the preceding hour-and-a-half had been similar. All of the actors seem to be trying to sell zaniness for the sake of being zany rather than achieving genuine pathos and character development with a blend of raunch. Justin Theroux is surprisingly funny, but the rest of the characters and their bits don't feel funny enough to warrant their time in the movie.

The characters in this movie weren't interesting nor were they relate-able at all. The movie itself feels like it just wears out and wastes a lot of time.

Though you may not be a nudist, a hippie, or a person that believes in free love, Wanderlust has something to offer.
