While quarantined in the transit lounge until authorities can figure out what to do with him, Viktor simply goes on living \u2013 and courts romance with a beautiful flight attendant.",

      "text": "Anyone who has traveled by plane usually hates wait long at customs or passenger control, and can lose his composure with delays or baggage losses. In this case, the unfortunate passenger played by Tom Hanks will go through a bit of all that for having lost his own nationality, ending retained \"ad aeternum\" in New York airport terminal. Assuming that this film is a comedy with some romance, the idea is good, even if it seems little logic. Despite this promising start, the script ends up lost in trivialities and huge plot holes. One of the most egregious is the fact that Viktor, Tom Hanks' character, who hardly spoke a word of English, having learned so quickly the language. His story with Amelia (played by Catherine Zeta-Jones) also does not fit in the rest of the film, so that is quickly cut with a simple and abrupt ending.Tom Hanks deserves, however, congratulations. He was again perfectly up to his work. His character could be just a caricature of any citizen of the former USSR countries, but he managed to give it a very kind and patient soul, who easily conquers the public. Zeta- Jones had less luck with her character, poorly planned and poorly embedded in the plot but, nevertheless, made a decent and satisfying work. Stanley Tucci makes a good villain in the person of airport immigration director, Frank Dixon.This film is pure entertainment, and it works very well in this light. But it could have been more intelligently developed in several aspects."

The character development was superb and even though some of the characters were not believable, they remained memorable such as the security staff and the port administrator.\r This movie is about a guy from a fictitious country who gets lost in the paperwork because his country ceased to exist while he was in flight. The shenanigans begin when his passport is rejected by US customs and the administrator of the terminal fails to communicate with him due to language barriers. From here everything goes haywire. The administrator cant get rid of Mr. Navorski (Tom Hanks) and and Mr. Navorski cant speak English and cant find anyone to help him translate what he sees on the TV (about the war in his country). Since his passport is not valid he cannot enter the USA and the airport authorities have no where to send him since his country no longer has any flights going to it. So what does he do? He starts learning English by comparing two travel guides, one in his language and one in English (recall this is pre-cell phone days). Along the way, he finds ways to make money so he no longer has to eat crackers with ketchup, lands a job, befriends a crazy Indian, goes on a date with a stewardess, helps a baggage handler meet and marry the girl of his dreams, helps people around the terminal in various ways, and eventually confronts the terminal authority that had him trapped (with the help of his new found friends).\r Its not supposed to be believable any more than Big was believable, and there are plot holes a plenty but it is a fun movie and was never meant to be taken very seriously. I highly recommend this movie."

Incredibly funny and cute, The Terminal features a great performance by Tom Hanks that really exceeds the overall quality of the film. It is incredibly safe and adverse to taking too many risks, but still manages to be an interesting look at this man's life in an airport after a crisis in his home nation leaves him stateless. Regardless, it is very entertaining and can be quite charming and moving at times in ways that only Spielberg films can. Somehow, that movie magic is still present in this film set solely in an airport terminal."

      "text": "With cinemas currently providing little refuge from disasters both natural and manmade, this buoyant, optimistic fable seems to share in the late Ronald Reagan's optimism for America. Tom Hanks stars as an immigrant unable to leave in a New York airport. Pic should quickly pilot its way to the helmer's usual numbers for non-genre fare.\r Fanciful as it sounds, the premise of \u201cThe Terminal\u201d is rooted in fact \u2014 specifically, the case of Iranian expatriate Merhan Karimi Nessari, who has, since 1988, resided in Terminal 1 of Paris\u2019 Charles de Gaulle Airport. (Previously, Nessari\u2019s story was the inspiration for the 1994 French pic \u201cLost in Transit.\u201d)\r Here, Hanks plays the Messari-inspired Viktor Navorski, who touches down on American soil only to discover that, during his flight, a political coup occurred in his fictional Eastern European homeland. Informed by businesslike Homeland Security officer Frank Dixon (well played by Stanley Tucci) that he is unable to return home or to seek asylum in the U.S. until our government recognizes the new regime, Viktor is ordered to stay put in the airport.\r Dixon reasons it\u2019s only a matter of time before his virtual prisoner escapes into the Big Apple and becomes some other agency\u2019s problem. But Viktor wants to enter the U.S. legally, for unspecified reasons that may concern the tin of Planters peanuts he carries around like a family heirloom.\r Restricted to the confines of the airport\u2019s glittering, glass-and-steel international transit area, Viktor patiently goes about making himself a home, while the film evolves into a gentle satire of the dilemmas of immigration and the resilience of this new American\u2019s entrepreneurial spirit.\r Screenplay slyly observes the terminal as a home to an entire community of uprooted persons \u2014 from Indian emigre janitor Gupta (scene-stealing Wes Anderson regular Kumar Pallana), who takes perverse pleasure in watching people slip across his freshly-waxed floors, to Mexican food-service worker Enrique (Diego Luna), who pines for the affections of a beautiful Customs officer (Zoe Saldana).\r There\u2019s also knockout United Airlines flight attendant Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones), whose meet-cute with Viktor owes itself to a waxy, Gupta-generated tumble. Embroiled in an unsatisfying affair with a married man (Michael Nouri), she finds herself drawn to Viktor\u2019s honesty and warmth, and able to relate to his feeling of living in an airport (which she initially mistakes as a metaphor).\r Yet, while Viktor and Amelia continue to rendezvous, their relationship becomes neither the focal point of \u201cThe Terminal\u201d nor a full-blown romance. And while Zeta-Jones is excellent at revealing Amelia\u2019s sad, delicate dimensions, she ultimately isn\u2019t in that much of the movie. Of course, that\u2019s part of pic\u2019s point \u2014 that in this crazy, mixed-up world, we rarely have time to stop and savor the things that really matter.\r For a movie about a man whose very nationality lingers in limbo for months, \u201cThe Terminal\u201d lacks any significant sense of conflict, and an 11th-hour subplot involving Art Kane\u2019s famous Harlem jazz portrait feels like something out of left field. But at its best, \u201cThe Terminal\u201d finds Spielberg working in the breezy, freewheeling fashion that dates back to his early \u201cThe Sugarland Express\u201d and his recent \u201cCatch Me if You Can.\u201d\r Spielberg does not appear to take himself or the material too seriously, and his steadfast refusal to see the proverbial glass as less than half-full is more inspiring than cloying. In Spielberg\u2019s world, it\u2019s possible for an immigrant to learn fluent English by reading a Fodor\u2019s travel guide. And, in a summer when the likes of \u201cTroy\u201d and \u201cThe Stepford Wives\u201d are what pass for old-fashioned Hollywood entertainment, it\u2019s a pleasure to spend time there.\r Astonishingly, pic\u2019s massive, detail-perfect set is just that \u2014 not a real airport terminal at all, but an exact replica constructed by production designer Alex McDowell in a Palmdale, Calif., aerospace hanger. (A few exteriors were shot in Montreal.)\r Though relatively minor compared to his superb work on the new \u201cHarry Potter\u201d pic, John Williams\u2019 score still offers an enjoyable coupling of typically Holst-ian fanfares and more adventurous, klezmer-influenced riffs.\r Perhaps pic\u2019s greatest technical pleasure, however, is the lustrous, color-saturated cinematography of regular Spielberg lenser Janusz Kaminski, whose work here registers at the opposite end of the spectrum from his signature faded hues and blown-out lighting schemes, resulting in a visual luxuriance that harks back to Spielberg\u2019s classic collaborations with d.p. Allen Daviau (\u201cE.T.,\u201d \u201cThe Color Purple,\u201d \u201cEmpire of the Sun\u201d)."

This film is the very definition of heartfelt.\rThe terminal is a fantastic Rom-Com filled with laughter, tears, and fleeting moments of pity that all come together to form a classic. For those living under a rock and have never seen Tom Hanks in a film before would not be judged for thinking he is eastern European. His performance as Viktor Navorski,  a man from  the fictional country of Krakozhia is magnificent. The ease in which he performs his role is awe inspiring. But he is far from alone. Stellar performances from Catherine Zeta-Jones and Stanley Tucci help to make a brilliant story based of true events. The scenes with Hanks and Tucci are particularly of interest. The accompaniment for this film is beautiful and perfectly reflects the mood in each scene.\rOverall The terminals a brilliant film that deserves to watched, loved and appreciated by all."

If, however, you were to take Spielberg's penchant for overly emotional schmalztz and channel that into Hanks' ability to emote you end up with this maudlin rubbish. Comedy can be farcial but should still be rooted in reality. The completely unbelievable nature of every plot point undermines any emotional resonance whatsoever. I give it 3 out of 10. It is still the product of a master of cinematic direction and very much looks like it. The minor characters are well cast and say something funny, every now and again. And, of course, Tom Hanks is extremely watchable. Honestly, if pretty much anyone else was cast in the lead role this films 2 hour duration really would feel like 9 months stuck in an airport terminal."

Tom Hanks did a great job (as always), as a man who visits New York from another country, and is not allowed to leave JFK airport or go back home. Stranded in the airport for almost a year he makes many friends (mostly from the janitoring staff) and falls in love with a history-obsessed flight attendant (Catherine Zeta-Jones). The movie is corny at parts, especially at the ending, but if you don't take it too seriously, I promise you you'll have a good time. Stanley Tucci is convincing as an a--hole.

      "text": "Not a terrible film by all means, but one where it is easy to see why it would polarise viewers (as evident in the user reviews here) and why there are those considering it a lesser Steven Spielberg film.'The Terminal' is not Spielberg's worst film, to me 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park', '1941' and 'War of the Worlds' (which had a very good first half and completely fell apart halfway through and never recovered) are worse. Ranking it in his filmography, it is nowhere near close to being one of his best and while not rock-bottom to me it is lesser Spielberg.Starting with 'The Terminal's' merits, the production values are top-notch and Spielberg regular Janusz Kaminski's cinematography is once again beautiful and a major plus. While not some of his best work, John Williams' score is pleasantly understated and slick without over-emphasising the mood.Of the performances, which mostly are good, Tom Hanks makes a valiant effort in the title role and does an excellent job on the most part and Stanley Tucci clearly enjoys himself as Dixon. Hanks and Tucci's chemistry is where 'The Terminal' is particularly strong. The supporting cast are good, and Kumar Pallana is quite a scene-stealer (though the wet floor stuff does get over-used and repetitive).'The Terminal' starts off well. The story is intriguing, there is a razor sharp satirical edge to some of the comedy and there is an affecting whimsy.However, 'The Terminal' is hurt by the second half being nowhere near as interesting and Spielberg himself (regardless of his technical mastery) playing it too safe with a subject matter that should have been executed in the film more sharply and harshly. There is too much emphasis on the airport-terminal-as-microcosm-of-society angle and it just doesn't work because of how tentatively and safely the subject is approached.Credibility rapidly decreases and gets increasingly strained and too often replaced by the sentimentality going into saccharine overload. Really could have done without the romantic subplot, that was not necessary, felt like thrown in padding and was completely underdeveloped and featured far too much. The lack of chemistry between Hanks and Catherine Zeta Jones doesn't help, nor does despite her beauty Zeta Jones being so bland in a role that gives her practically nothing to do. The characters are also far too neatly black and white with stereotypes that won't bode, and actually hasn't boded, well with some.Overall, wildly uneven that had potential to be good but doesn't ever fully convince. 5/10 Bethany Cox"

In the end, you begin to retreat the hope and wonder that \"Terminal\" could've been a masterful exploration of an unnacepted immigrant and just fall into the seemlessly in-the-motions romancity that it plays off, so you go home with the splendor like it's Christmas Eve but without the substance it teased at providing."
