As the fog rolled in at midnight, the four actresses used actual Wiccan rites and language to invoke powerful forces. Then, as Fairuza Balk's character Nancy attempts to invoke the deity Manon, a flock of bats hovered over the set and the tide rose dramatically, extinguishing the circle of candles. Witchcraft consultant Devin recalls that 'Manon, a fictitious creation for the film, sounds very close to Mananan, the Gaelic god of the sea. Luckily, we weren't all swept to sea!'\" Director Andrew Fleming is quoted: \"'Every time the girls started the ceremony, and only when they would start the ceremony, the waves would start coming up tremendously fast, pounding heavily. Then, right when Nancy says her line, \"Manon, fill me,\" right at that exact moment, we lost power. It was a very strange thing.'\""}, {"rating": "9", "text": "One of the best movies of 1996. ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "The craft is an effective horror ride. Neve Campbell & Skeet Ulrich are great in the movie, as are all the actors. The movie revolves around a foursome of teenage witches who go to a catholic school.

Well the movie holds up surprisingly well and some part of that may be due to nostalgia but I really loved it, maybe even more than before. Robin Tunney(End of Days) stars as Sara the new girl at school who falls into a group of outcast witches after being burned by the popular kids. Once she joins the coven the stars align and they begin to experience some real power. The only problem is the maniacal and charasmatic leader Nancy played by a feisty Fairuiza Balk (Island of Dr. Moreau) gets power hungry and takes her vengeance to another level. Rachael True (Half Baked) and the always awesome Neve Campbell star as the other two members battling their own problems and insecurities. What makes the film work so well is the sisterhood and sometimes twisted friendship of these girls. They feel genuine and their stories are relatable  as they deal with every day problems ranging from rumors to racism, abuse and body issues. The witchcraft is an added bonus and unlike most films of it's kind it delivers on that aspect including a slightly short but effective finale. Christine Taylor (Brady Bunch), Skeet Ulrich (Scream) and Breckin Meyer (Clueless) also star. The film is confidently directed by Andrew Fleming of one of my favorite 80s flicks Bad Dreams with a screenplay by Peter Filardi of Flatliners. It also features an amazing soundtrack with songs by Our Lady Peace, Letters to Cleo, Love spit love and more. I'm sure who's ever reading this has a love for this film as I do, so maybe it's time for a revisit.Budget: $15MBox Office: $55.6M9/10"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "The Craft is one of my fave horror thrillers.

It is not supposed to be scary, not in the traditional sense anyway. The 90's brought a resurgence of teen horror and comedy movies onto our screens. 90% of these are awful, but this one was different. The Craft refuses to be labeled as horror or comedy, but has strong elements of both, and it is more akin to Heathers, than any other recent film. Campbell is as gorgeous as always, and her performance is good, Balk is superb, while the rest of the cast is respectable, and both the script and effects are sharp, giving the movie a darker tone than any of its contemporaries. The clich\u00e9s are there, with the outsider becoming the hero, and the non-conforming females of the period show they can be happy and free. If happy means Goth.

Great to see in a theater or on a large screen TV."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Has surely held up!You know, I love the movies Ideal Home and Bad Dreams. I'd never guess that they were both written and directed by the same person, Andrew Fleming. You may not know the man, but chances are you know his 1996 film, The Craft.Producer Douglas Wick (he produced Stuart Little and also co-wrote the sequels) wanted to create a movie that mixed the high school experience with witchcraft, which he worked on with screenwriter Peter Filardi (Flatliners). Well, he sure did it. This is a movie that was a quiet hit but has never gone away. Take it from someone who has dated plenty of goth girls.Sarah Bailey (Robin Tunney, wearing a wig as she had shaved her head for Empire Records) is the new girl in town, having moved from Los Angeles to San Francisco with her father (Cliff DeYoung, Shock Treatment) and stepmother. She soon becomes friends with a group of outcasts who are rumored to be witches: the scarred Bonnie (Neve Campbell), trailer trash and totally awesome Nancy (the legit Wiccan Fairuza Balk, who was also in Return to Oz) and Rochelle (Rachel True, CB4), whose black skin in a nearly all white school makes her a target of ridicule. The witch rumor? Yeah, it's true. They all worship an entity they refer to as Manon.Sarah becomes attracted to the popular Chris Hooker (Skeet Ulrich, who was very much a thing in 1996), but he claims that they slept together and ruins her reputation before it gets started. That leads to the girls finally completing a big spell that gives them everything they want: Chris falls in love so hard that he can't live without Sarah, racist bully Laura Lizzie (Christine Taylor) loses her hair and popularity, Bonnie becomes gorgeous and Nancy's abusive stepfather dies and she gets rich.However, it's not enough. After a rite called the \"Invocation of the Spirit,\" Nancy gains even more power because, you know, she got hit by lightning (actual Wiccan Pat Devin was the on-set advisor, so maybe this really does occur). Now she can't be stopped and all of the girls other than Sarah have gone wrong. The coven turns on her, but Sarah ends up stronger than all of them.Of course, Blumhouse is remaking this, with Zoe Lister-Jones directing. There was talk of another remake and a direct to video sequel which never happened. I had hoped that that luck would have stopped this new version, but it's already finished production.I learned a really important lesson from The Craft. The girl I was dating at the releasal of the movie, asked me which member of the coven I found most attractive. I said none of them. She kept pressing and begging for my answer. Of course Fairuza Balk is the right answer, but I kept quiet until finally, after an entire meal of her asking, I told her. She instantly grew angry and said, \"The right answer is none of them!\" Somewhere inside this story is a lesson.I love the scene where all the fish wash up and the coven realizes how much power they possess. You don't know how many occasions the women in my life have made me watch this movie. I have become smarter and not said a single thing about Nancy."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "The best movie about witchcraft everAlong with The Witches of Eastwick.
