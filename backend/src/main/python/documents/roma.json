All I came away from the screening of this thing was #MaidsLivesMatter and... so what.  The flimsy story is constructed around beautiful images, that more rightful belong in a photo album and not on a movie screen.  I was appalled at the lack of reality in the substance of the characters.  Also, I do not believe that the ending is in any way plausible.

I never got to connect with any character, thanks to a very lack of emotions from them they are just cast into a one dimensional role, and they never get out of it. If he tried to portrait the maid as they are in Mexico (I mean very submissive and so desperate that they accept any circumstances) then all the other characters should have a large array of emotions so there's contrast. But there's just no contrast they're all superficial stereotype persons.A lot of scenes could  have also been removed and we could have ended up with a much shorter and less tedious movie instead we have a very long, predictable with a lot of useless scenes movie, might it repeat again there are some beautiful shots tho. I hope it doesn't get the Oscar because there are just so many better narrated and well shot movies out there.I will end my review doing this comparison;Roma is like a picture of some delicious food that you see it and it looks just so good, but then cut the picture and realize it was nothing but emptiness and regret to ever tried"}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Roma is quite underwhelming.

The main differences are that these films and directors didn't take 2+ hours to tell their stories or linger too long even by a second on a scene whether it be a boy looking out a car window or a dog jumping up against a gate. They brought new cinematography to the screen and more depth to their stories.Maybe it has been a long time since critics/people have seen such films that reflect life between the classes or maybe \"Downton Abbey\" has given them a false picture of the same. There are little passions or emotions shown by the director/screenwriter Alfonso Cuaron.The surprising aspect of \"Roma\" is the acting debut of Yalitza Aparicio as a maid who has a warm connection to the children of her employers and though she is a presence throughout the film it only comes alive when it concentrates on her trials and tribulations.With the exception of maybe 15 minutes, I was bored during most of the 2-hour 18-minute  \"Roma\"."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Aside from the photography that looks great, there are a lot of issues within this movie, the passing, the plot, is pretentious and unfocused.

While not every film needs a \u201cclimax\u201d to sum up a great story, I just felt this was a slightly less enjoyable watch than A Star Is Born or even The Favorite.

It is obviously copying Zerkalo (The Mirror) by Tarkovsky but with far less ingenuity, creativity and poetry. Whereas Tarkovsky makes his life and his memories interesting by cleverly destroying time and space, blurring the lines between reality and dream, and making us think, think, think about our own memories, Cuaron serves a linear, egotistical, boring diaporama of his own life that didn't touch me at all. All this of course with a heavy dose of sentimentality and \"humanism\" that can't go wrong with middle-class critics.But what about the cinematography?The initial slow constant circular movement of the camera is obviously designed to clash with the perpetual zig-zagging of the little bee worker, create this extra tension and the rest is just like that. The scene of the fire is completely in line with his work in \"children of men\" with camera shifting from different points of foci in the same frame.

Unfortunately, those are about the only redeeming qualities this release has to offer. The rest is a big, bloated, underdeveloped bore that tries the patience of even the most tolerant cinephile. It's obvious this was a heartfelt project for director Alfonso Cuaron, and his personal passion is written all over it. But, given that he's dealing with uninteresting characters in largely unexplained circumstances in a time frame for which little to no context or back story is provided, he's not giving the audience much to work with other than a glib implication that essentially says \"This is authentic -- just trust me on this.\" Also, the picture's anemic attempts at incorporating philosophical and metaphysical themes show the filmmaker's got some brushing up to do in terms of effectively conveying his meaning in a comprehensible way.

It's amongst the most gorgeously shot black and white films on record, which is all the more impressive considering Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n serves as the film's writer, director, AND cinematographer.  There's also no distinguishing between fiction and reality.  In particular, the actors in the movie make this slice-of-life film feel like it's a biography.  And finally, if 'Roma' indeed goes on to win the Oscar for Best Picture--right now it's certainly a contender--it'll eventually be saddled with the reputation of being undeserving of the honor, much like 'Crash' or 'Shakespeare In Love.'The bottom line is that no matter how vividly shot a picture may be  (*cough cough* Terrence Malick), without an engaging plot, everything else is just cinematic masturbation.  Lastly, a point of privilege: one reviewer fawned over Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n's camerawork, setting expectations rather high.  However, while a number of sequences are indeed wonderfully shot, basic left-to-right or right-to-left pans aren't exactly innovative.

It is a tribute to women - Cleo, the protagonist, but also all who prominently appear:  The other housekeeper, Adela, as well as the two patrician women in the household (though they are flawed, they are kind and loving overall), right down to the female obstetrician.  On the other hand, we have the men who abandon them and their families; the shooters;  the posers like Fermin who show off to a point that becomes downright ridiculous (you will remember that scene); the ones in military bands who march through the streets for no apparent reason at all ... and who of course are flying the planes that intersect the sky throughout.  In the big martial arts demonstration in the field, who among them is able to execute the pose demonstrated by the teacher?  The martial arts students are all falling over, while (did I see this wrong?  The movie begs repeat viewings) isn't it Cleo, among the women on the sidelines watching all this, who pulls it off?  Is there one likable male character here at all?The ultimate message I got was that it is women who know how to love, while men are absorbed in themselves, to the point of disruption, and the most profound effect of this disparity is on the children.  Women save and nurture while men work against them. The betrayed and abandoned wife says bluntly that women are always alone.  Here, they are in one sense - that men disrespect them and/or fail to even stick around; but the women actually aren't alone.  It's love that binds them to each other, and to the children who could not thrive without them.

The sound is flat where in the theater it was immersive and 3D (such as the laundry scene and the hill scene with the animals), and the size and scale of the set really is not given its full due on a television screen.

The cinematography was usually wide angle, which means no close-ups of faces and eyes, contributing to the visual lack of character development. It felt like the Director had a check-list of scenes drawn from mostly Italian and Italian Neo-Realism films. So while the film did not seem superficial, the effort was in the end more of a style exercise than emotional storytelling. I give it an 8 because movies today are so dreadful. This film is worth watching and discussing, but does not rise to be considered a truly great film."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Very well done cinematically. Beautiful story but not terribly original. Entirely subtitled and therefore I assume it will be a Foreign Language contestant at the Oscars and not Best Picture."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Intellectualise all you wish about the black and white, the nostalgia, the sentiment, the script, or whatever. I challenge you not to be moved by the human force of this movie. Ace production design, and Cuaron himself as cinematographer getting great shot after great shot, this is one of the movies of the century. Loved the opening sequence, which is simply the maid sluicing the ceramic tiles - with the totally Cuaron exception of a tiny airplane reflection in the gleaming water. He's put his best soul into this, and will never equal it."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Just can't explain how much I liked this movie. MUST see if you're into good camera handling and good shots. Quite slow movie but that makes you enjoy it more. 10/10 for me, absolutely."}], "recommendations": ["hugo", "the_green_knight", "the_master", "cloud_atlas", "perfume_the_story_of_a_murderer", "youth", "the_social_network", "barry_lyndon", "annette", "the_american", "joker", "drive", "the_fountain", "dunkirk", "marie_antoinette", "black_swan", "all_eyez_on_me", "you_were_never_really_here", "the_neon_demon", "babel", "eyes_wide_shut", "2001_a_space_odyssey", "magnolia", "there_will_be_blood", "the_power_of_the_dog"]}
