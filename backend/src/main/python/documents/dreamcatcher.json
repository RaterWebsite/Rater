I have never been more irritated and unsatisfied as I was at the end of this movie. I went in thinking a movie starring Jason Lee, Morgan Freeman and Tom Sizemore based on a Stephen King would be a can't miss. WRONG. In fact I have never been more wrong; the down syndrome/ alien Donnie Wahlberg angle was the most misconceived subplot I have ever seen in a movie and I saw Gigli and Longshot. I threw my remote at the TV after this and it literally ruined my whole day. If you are really considering seeing this movie call me first I will personally shove a snake up your rearend and kick you in the family jewels while I tell you your were supposed to be an abortion and your parents feel they made the wrong decision. I am putting everyone that had anything to do with this movie on a temporary timeout."

As with all Steven King novels/adaptations, it shows what people are capable of (good and bad) by putting them in extreme (read unbelievable) situations. The people in this movie are flawed but noble and offer a good window to the soul. Suspend reality, and commit yourself to the people more than the plot and you can enjoy it as well."

      "text": "It's a stupid movie. A rather juvenile affair. You've got burping, farting, and aliens crawling out of people's buttholes. However, there is a sense of brilliance and imagination here. Deeper elements going on in the background to make it more mature than it otherwise seems. It really makes me wish I read the book. Unfortunately the movie seems to focus on the stupider elements of the Stephen King novel and leaves the more thoughtful ones to the wayside.\r Like most Stephen King stories, this is very character driven. Only it seems somebody forgot to tell the director that. There is painfully little context as to whose these people are or how their little catchphrases, nicknames, and shared insights originated. That's the issue with the movie. It's more intelligent material is left unexplained. It merely lays out the basic plot and asks viewers not to ask questions about the deeper fiction holding all together that was required for it to succeed in the first place. As far as the plot goes, it just leaves you wondering. Baffled as well.\r Yep, this body horror is all about the blood, guts, and bodily functions. The movie approaches all of these with a sense of glee and self-amusement. The results are surprisingly not terrible. I can't attest to how well it stays faithful to the source material, but one thing is certain and that's Stephen King certainly got imaginative with this one.\r It's all really bat crap crazy. Certainly one of the most unique and unpredictable movies I have ever seen. The cast seems totally committed, even if there is a certain hammy tone to each of their performances at times. It's the level of insanity on display that adds an entertaining nature to the film. It's hard to not be interested in what's going on even if you are just there to look for answers that will never come.\r I can't say I totally feel like I wasted my time on this one. I was certainly never bored with it. The plot and immaturity left me disappointed with the overall results, and it's certainly not scary in any way. That being said I still had fun with it even in it's childish of moments. Admittedly despite myself.\r Does that mean I can recommend it? Yes and no. If you are looking for a movie truly unlike anything else out there then it's definitely worth a look. It won't leave you completely satisfied with the end results, but at least it will get you thinking. However for those looking for genuine frights and thrills to go along with the gore, as well as a plot that won't leave you frustrated and clueless with it's more compelling elements, then you should likely look elsewhere. Dreamcatcher isn't exactly a bad film. It's definitely got it's enjoyable elements. It's just not exactly a good movie either. That's because it fails to touch on the more complex parts of King's story."

The movie is, sadly, not the case. \"Dreamcatcher\" is not a \"Signs\". It is a spectacle of vomiting proprotions...[Potential spoiler deleted]. Not only that, it is a poor adaptation full of cliches and pathetic acting. The military aspect of the movie was emphasised on too much and I found the storyline about the Down-syndrome kid a bit disturbing."

Many of the inner voice dialouges that worked so well in the novel just don't work in a movie like they were meant to be, and the movie often feels like a bad joke. Along with horrible acting, storytelling and plot development, Dreamcatcher is also horrible at entertaining the viewer. The CGI was overbearingly fake looking and the awful performances from the usually decent actors did nothing to rectify it. Two thumbs WAAAAYYYY down! The only reason i gave it a 1 is because my sister and I got SUCH a laugh out of this bad film that it was at least worth viewing once."

Needless to say i enojyed watching it. I wasnt really happy with the cast plus characters were dull and boring but they did their job. I wasnt really satisfied with the enviroment either, there was nothing but snow so it was also dull and boring. Story was great in the other hand. With more effort and bigger budget this movie would have been awesome."

      "text": "I am divided by this movie. I like what I see but often thought that I missed some context or a bit of information and this lessens the experience. I thought that they cut out some scenes or could not do all they wanted because of budgetary reasons. Also parts of the story or reveals feel unbelievable. However this could be just me to be fair but others complained about that too to be honest too. It is based on the Stephen King novel Duddits that I have not read. So I cant say if it is a good adaptation and you don't have to endure the unavoidable \u201cThe books are better\u201d statement. Stephen King was mostly unlucky with his adaptation. For each Green Mile or Shawshank Redemption there are many poor adaptions of his works. This movie here has a good set up, fascinating ideas and concepts but also misses the higher marks and has some weaknesses too. Story: It is set in 2 time periods like other Stephen Kings stories and the past is told in flashbacks. In the past as children the friends Beaver, Jonesy, Pete and Henry saved the disabled boy Duddits from bullies. They received an incredible gift from him in return. Years later now as adults the four of them have a habit of making an annual hunting trip. However this time it will be something no one anticipated as strange things happen. With this set up the story starts and I keep it spoiler free. Like I already said I am divided. Parts of the story are great and others fail for me. For example the final reveal for Duddits got me immediately out of the immersion and I started to question myself how this is possible and be undetected. The storytelling lacks a bit of coherence. I always felt that I missed something or skipped a part with explanations. I should be a bit more ironed out and I see why others rated this lower. Also while I like the menacing situation I always felt they could do this better. The menace should easily win with their available tools and it reminded me of \u201cSigns\u201d were they do a similar stupid thing. So for the story it is a hit and miss at the same time. Actors / characters: I think we got a good cast with Thomas Jane, Jason Lee, Damian Lewis and Timothy Lewis as the four adult friends and Mikey Holekamp, Giacomo Baessato, Reece Thompson and Joel Palmer as their younger versions. Good performance by all of them and I saw no missteps. Of cause we have Morgan Freeman as Abraham Curtis in a really good performance. I repeat as in many other reviews that there is no bad performance or truly bad movie with Morgan Freeman. Other than those I liked Donnie Wahlberg / Andrew Robb as Duddits and Tom Sizemore as Owen Underhill. We got a good overall performance but those could not save the movie from the weaker storytelling. Presentation wise I thought the movie looked good. While most special effects worked really well there are some exceptions. Overall I see the potential of a better movie underneath the problems. It is not truly awful but also not great. Maybe to much mixture of genres and not enough focus on the strengths of the story like the set up, characters and menace."
