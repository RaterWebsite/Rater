      "text": "Typical Sparks story. Girl meets boy, they fall in love unrealistically fast, then tragedy strikes, yanking cheap sobs out of you. My first complaint about this movie is Miley Cyrus. Sparks says he wrote the screen play and the novel for her, which makes me question his sanity. With Cyrus doing the best she can to deliver the completely over the top typical-teen lines, it's just painful to watch. Then, when she meets Will (played by Liam Hemsworth) she is first cold to him, but then after going on one date with him she is all of a sudden in love with him - it didn't really make sense. This movie moves way too fast, I didn't even feel like I got to know the characters by the time the film was over(Although by the expression Cyrus's character wore on her face the entire time, I'm not sure I would want to) and it moves from scene to scene in an extremely choppy manner. Not even Greg Kinnear could save this tragedy of a film."

      "text": "The Last Song is a great book adaptation. I think they could have chosen someone else besides Miley Cyrus, but she gives a solid performance as rebellious teen Ronnie. Liam Hemsworth also performs well as Will, and thier romance definitely struck a chord with me. Similarly, Ronnie's relationship with her dad was very emotional for me to watch.  I loved everything about this film and it will always be a favorite."

Miley Cyrus's acting! To be honest all I could see from her was a girl putting a sad face on. The thing about actors and actresses these days. They get payed a lot of money and they should be making us believe that she is angry, believe that she is sad, BELIEVE that she is BROKEN! during the entire movie I never felt her trying to tell us that she is a broken girl.The film itself is was the same same predictable thing with this happening and that happening. This film really disappointed me. I really thought that this could be a break for the leading actress but now I am just seeing a girl with a pretty face who is getting paid a lot of money for wasting our time!"

Basically, she meets her father, feels like she's about to kill him when she discovers he has cancer and he never told her about a month later, she breaks up with her boyfriend because he's a chick magnet, her rage over her father grows excruciatingly, then all of a sudden her father dies and she suddenly feels sorry for him and decides to beat on her boyfriend in a PG rated fashion in her PMS-ic anger.

I don't get why people say \"it tries to make you cry too hard.\" What's that even supposed to mean? Better than \"The Notebook\", in my opinion. Another melodramatic love story, but the movie has a OK script, and I did feel emotional towards the end a bit."

Miley Cyrus was a complete knock-over in this film as her performance was horrendous. Her facial expressions; her way of speaking; her dialogue given was all just a complete mess. The film also falls into the trap of the romantic cliches: the boy meets girl; conflict commences; the break-up moment happens; there's a resolution and they live happily ever after. That's pretty much the entire film guys!\r Rating: 2/10\r A+ = 10\rA = 9\rA- = 8\rB+ = 7\rB = 6\rB- = 5\rC+ = 4\rC = 3\rC- = 2.5\rD+ = 2\rD = 1.5\rD- = 1\rF = 0"
