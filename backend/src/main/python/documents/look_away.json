This is really very well directed and the cinematography is exemplary. The lead role is absolutely amazing and the rest of the cast feet perfectly to the film. The original score is really superb and have a real emotional impact on the scenes. The dark point of Look Away cames from the story, unfortunately the plot isn't as great as the technical aspect. Looks like a kind of strange variation on Stephen King's The Dark Half with a more schizophrenic part. If you're looking for a great screenplay you'll probably be disappointed but if you're looking for a well directed film it really deserves it."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Meek girl had a dead twin sister hiding in her mirror who starts talking to her and then takes her place to do the things that she can't do - like killing."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "I can't say this was bad for these kind of films but it can be better if just film was a few longer to describe the main character and her dark \"avatar\".
