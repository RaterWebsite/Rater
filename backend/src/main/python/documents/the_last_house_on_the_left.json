The stupidity of the girls that got them into trouble in the first place and the seemingly helplessness of the parents when dealing with the rapists crew. The whole damn movie was a waste of time. Right up there with Ishtar in my book. Best part of the movie was the revenge dished out at the end, pardon the pun."

I hope everyone can see where I'm coming from here. This film is very bad and terrible in everyway possible. It's crap compared to Wes Craven's original horror film made back in (1972). If I was on the MPAA ratings board I would've  rated them opposite of each other. The 1972 film gets an R rating and the 2009 remake gets an NC-17. I see no reason why the 1972 film should be given an X rating. I think it definitely deserves an R, but not an X rating, I think the ratings board had bad judgment there. I think now that the film's on DVD and Blu-ray they should re-submit it to the MPAA so they can have another look at it. They should re-release it either in theaters one more time or straight to DVD, so the public and movie-goers can see why they got the rating for this film wrong in the first place. This film has terrible acting, bad scripted dialogue and the special effects are way overboard. I think this film plus the Saw films and the Hostel films should all be given an NC-17 rating. I'm on the fence with Halloween (2007) though. I think that one should stay rated: R. But I do think that the (2009) sequel should be slapped with an NC-17. The violence is more brutal and bloody than the remake. All in all The remake of The Last House On The Left is just pure torture and predictable, everyone should avoid buying this movie at all costs, and someone should contact the MPAA and get this movie re-rated."

      "text": "There's no virgin spring, but this remake of a remake has a virgin swimming pool, and a virgin lake. [***SPOILER***] This teenaged swimmer must have one hell of a regimen to survive what she survived. Mari(Sara Paxton) is raped, shot at, and crawls home in the rain with a bullet lodged in her body. For all intents and purposes, Mari needs to stay dead, in lieu of what happens to Mari's attackers. What Mari's parents do to the rapist and his colleagues violates the spirit of the maxim \"an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth\". By keeping Mari alive, the parents' vengeance is robbed of its righteousness and purpose; by keeping Mari alive, the parents end up looking like sadists. Since \"The Last House on the Left\" lacks the good sense to keep the logic of the Wes Craven original intact, why not break the mold irreparably and let Mari be more pro-active; why not let the girl go after her own attackers? Not only because she was brutally raped, but also because she has to share her victimhood with a guy. Competing for the audience's sympathy, this reboot has a hireling, the rapist's son, whose suffering is concentrated over a longer period of time than Mari, so therefore becomes the real subject of the film. When will the cowering son face finally up to his intemperate father? \"The Last House on the Left\" wants to have it both ways: to be an exploitation movie with a happy ending like some studio flick. Within the film's outward appearance of graphic violence, drug use, and sexual deviancy, beats a tame PG-13 heart."

      "text": "I was rather pleased after seeing this remake for the first time; it was a decent movie with some great performances from a believable cast, a great soundtrack from John Murphy (who also wrote the score for one of my favourite films, 28 Days Later), and it stayed pretty accurate to the source material. Everybody should already be familiar with the plot of The Last House on the Left. The original is a horror classic, and a must-see, although its sheer explicit nature means it didn't become available uncut in the UK until last year. The remake is nowhere near as explicit in either the violence or the rape sequence; the latter was extraordinarily disgusting, but I admire the filmmakers for making it so. Too often do we see some pretty dumb girl raped in the woods and somebody in the cinema will shout \"dumb bitch had it coming!\" Nothing like this happened with The Last House on the Left. Like I said, a very believable cast managed to make the audience connect with the characters in a sympathetic way. As for the plot, yes, some things have changed (apart from the names, I mean.) Some characters that live died in the original, and vice versa. Give the new director some creative license, people! This is HIS movie, not Wes Craven's. Give the director a chance to experiment with what is his to make. Additionally, a comment to Golder, who walked out of the cinema once the rape scene commenced: if you were so excited to see this because it was \"Wes Cracen producing (or shadowing) what was his original creation back in the 1970's\", then you should have already been aware that Wes Craven's original 1972 Last House on the Left contained an even more explicit rape scene, and that the classification information for the film warns that there is a scene of rape. If it's something that offends you so much, look it up first. A decent film, strong acting, good direction... I give it a 7."

The acting was much better and the editing smooth but the changes to the storyline, the new methods of disposing of the rapists and the \"perfect ending\" took away from what made the original so thought provoking and haunting. Gone are the elements of torture and rape that made the first Wes Craven effort so jarring. Also gone is the documentary style filming that made the original seem even more real. I was greatly disappointed considering the quality of actors, the budget and the experience Wes Craven has gained in 37 years. A total waste of time and money!"

      "text": "As a pre-warning, this review is a little shorter than it really should be, for reasons you'll come to understand, typically, shortly. When I saw this being advertised I was hoping to find a well managed movie due to Wes Cracen producing (or shadowing) what was his original creation back in the 1970's. The film begins alright as much films usually do, introducing the basis of the film and it's main characters in timely fashion. The music isn't bad, it seems to suit the film very well even though it appears to be more melodramatic than needs to be at the start, we can let that slip though. The acting seems pretty natural, I was surprised at how the younger actors didn't over emphasise every panicked line with arms flailing all over the place. They seemed cold, frightened and eerily still, frozen to the spot. I havn't got much more to compliment this film on, as I said before, due to the fact that I stopped watching the film soon after sitting myself in the cinema. If i'd know there was going to be a rape scene in the movie I'd never have gone to see it. I think that fact should be highlighted, in text, during theatrical trailors for films that contain such filth. I had to get out of my chair when this started to unfold and ask for my money back, which I got. Needles to say I think I'll be double checking next time I see a horror movie. A 2 for the efforts that I saw until the let down."

This movie was nothing like that though. This movie is very in your face with a lot of horrible imagery. Everything from a girl being stabbed in the stomach to an outright rape. The movie does a great job of building the characters and the acting is solid with the exception of Paige (Martha McIsaac) and Sadie (Riki Lindhome). The thing that actually bothered me the most was the very last scene. The move had a very solid ending and it fades to black only to come back on a microwave and the villain. I'm not here to spoil it to you but it was one of the only useless moments that was only in the movie to pad running time and add gore. Overall this movie is pretty solid and well worth a watch."

Honestly anyone who remembers 1972\u2019s shocking version of the Virgin Spring had to know this remake would pull back the reigns. It would be like a remake of \u201cI Spit on your Grave\u201d... just not likely in these conservative and commercial times. Well at least they did not make it PG-13.\r They screw up they remake early with two changes. The bad guys are bad guys from the start. There is no connection with the audience. No sense that they are travelling down a path as well; they do not connect with the audience as the hippies of the first film did. There is no sense that they are exploring there boundaries or challenging themselves. They start fully formed as black hats.\r The second mistake is moving the story out of a regular middle class neighborhood and into a millionaires\u2019 nature retreat. There is something shocking about violence among the shag carpeting and wood paneling of suburbia (The original movie was from 1972 after all) that is lost with the large Architectural Digest house perfectly clean and decorated. (Though with the filmiest wooden furniture this side of a thirties Western).\r The rape is much less graphic than the original and the sense of sadism and intimacy of the first film is lost. On the plus side, Tony Goldwyn and Monica Potter give great performances as the parents and the revenge scenes are not completely without a sense of fun.\r If this film was called something else, I might have gone easier on it. As a Last House on the Left film, it is a glossy shadow of its predecessor."

      "text": "After a failed attempt at sitting through the original version - due to boredom, abysmal acting and overwhelming 70s camp - I approached this one with fairly low hopes. And for the first half, it seemed to confirm my fears. The script seemed shoddy and pointless, and the characters were so unrealistic it began to annoy me. But just as I was about to turn this one off too, Mari shows up at the house. And things take an eventful and scary turn. The second half of the film is well paced, well acted and very tense. On the whole, I'm glad I watched it - it's certainly a better class of horror remake. The cinematography is atmospheric, John Murphy's soundtrack is very good and only occasionally intrusive, and it knocks the original film out of the water. But with all that said, Aaron Paul's promising career may stand more of a chance if he quietly leaves this one off his showreel."

A huge improvement to the original was a consistently dark atmosphere. In Wes Craven's version, it felt silly at times, namely the scenes with the cops and the whole \"Willow\" stuff. This remake was also a lot more intense and suspenseful, and the danger felt a lot more real. The ending may somewhat blunt the movie's overall effect, but, hey, how often do you get that sort of ending in a horror movie? The rape scene was very difficult to sit through because it was so long and realistic, which is my only real complaint. If you had to choose to watch the original or the remake, I would go with the remake because it's a lot more thrilling, and it's far superior to Wes Craven's version overall."

The story revolves around three sadistic criminals who kill mercilessly and who decide to hide in a quiet middle-aged couple's vacation home, hours after they raped and tried to kill their daughter. The story is really good and the environment is tense from start to finish. The rape scene is one of the hardest to watch I've ever seen. However, from the middle, the film loses some interest because it becomes predictable and similar to other horror films like \"You're Next\", for example. What saves the film, at that moment, is the sympathy that we have already felt for the couple and their daughter. This connection allows the public's attention not to be scattered because we still want to see the bad guys punished. Garret Dillahunt is incredible in the role of the gang boss, managing to make his character an unbearably disgusting presence. Riki Lindhome and Aaron Paul were more restrained but no less competent. Sara Paxton was reasonable, but her role gradually becomes secondary, giving way to Tony Goldwyn and Monica Potter, a good duo who really did a great job. In the end, what we have is a good remake that, while not surprising, is able to entertain and cause some shivers."
