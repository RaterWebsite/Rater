      "text": "With a somewhat inventive history, it has better interpretations and production values \u200b\u200bthan its predecessor.This film is the predictable sequel to \"Godzilla\", with the appearance of a legion of monstrous creatures called Titans. I liked, in general, the 2014 film, and I went to see this film with some interest, believing that finally Godzilla was having a more interesting treatment from the cinema. And I confess that I am not disappointed, as the film is even better than its predecessor in some important points.The film takes the point where the previous one ended and reveals to us the efforts made since then, to create a way of understanding and reproducing the vocalizations of the monsters already awake. It is with this technology that Emma Russel, allied with a group of mercenaries, tries to wake up the sleeping monsters that Monarch monitors. She thinks it will restore a natural balance in the world, perhaps through a massacre. I confess that I found this part of the script somewhat confusing. Against her is ex-husband Mark, who argues that all monsters should simply be killed or left to sleep. It doesn't matter, the fact is that they wake up the only one who should have been left to sleep: the Guidorah hydra, the only one that has the capacity to wake everyone up and control them to slaughter Humanity. It is now up to Godzila and her fellow humans to contain this threat, even if it means the partial destruction of the world.As in the previous film, there are good and bad things in this story. It's a little hard to believe that creatures like that would spend thousands of years sleeping without being detected by curious humans. On the other hand, the film makes good use of material from classic legends involving monsters (Scilla, Kong, the Loch Ness Monster, Hydra and others). I was not convinced by the supposed alien origins of Hydra, I think it is a little credible detail of the script. There is also a time when everyone seems to stumble over Atlantean civilization, but that is never even mentioned.The cast's work is more enjoyable in this film than in its predecessor. For a start, I felt that there were more possibilities to connect with the characters. This bet made the film gain more interest as we feel more involved in the action and care more about what happens. Godzilla, in this respect, is a character in his own right. Among the human cast I would positively highlight Kyle Chandler and Vera Farmiga. Both do a good job, even though the character of Farmiga is very difficult to understand and unworthy of our sympathy. Watanabe continues to maintain the good performance that started in the previous film, ending it brilliantly. I don't know if all the merit belongs to the actor or if the screenwriter also reserved better material for the actor, but the truth is that it worked very well. Bradley Whitford, Aisha Hinds, Ziyi Zhang and Sally Hawkins do a good job of support. Millie Bobby Brown is almost left in the film and has little to do but be in danger when the script needs an extra reason for the characters to move faster.The film maintained the good production values \u200b\u200bof its predecessor. And there is no doubt that there is a lot of money invested. A grandiose and impressive CGI, with scenarios of pure destruction everywhere, the bet on a more luminous environment, which allows the public to better see the destruction of the world and the epic battles that are fought among the human ruins. Now we see better what the first film kept wrapped in dust and shadows. The monstrous creatures also seem to me better worked and realistic. We also have impressive sound and visual effects, good post-production work, with excellent mixing and editing, well-crafted special effects, good sets, costumes and props.Overall, it is a satisfying action and sci-fi film, with a somewhat elaborate story that works well if we don't think about it too much. You can pass the time, although it is not a work of cinema art. Godzilla will certainly continue to be a recurring monster in cinema, even though it does not give rise to really good films."

This time, more attention is put on the monsters, giving us some spectacular monster fights.  And just when you thought King Ghidorah couldn't be more of a bad-@$$ in the Toho films...surprise!  Don't get me wrong, the film is far from flawless (the ending alone had me facepalming).  And with some of the characters, it was like they forgot there's still a 3rd film coming.

Bringing back the big four classic monsters from Toho, this movie brings Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan and the evil Ghidorah to their full potential while staying true to their classic lore. The only downside is that you don't see as much Mothra and Rodan as you the other two monsters fighting for the fate of the world and there is one ugh scene where Godzilla and Ghidorah charge at each other, only to cut away to the monarch ship watching them fight from a distance. Aside from that, with a tremendous music score, I highly recommend anyone who loves the Godzilla movies or have an interest in the franchise to check this one out."

Yes, every human in the movie makes dumb, bad decisions until the point they realize they have to work with Godzilla not against him. In short, it's a Godzilla movie. Don't go expecting the best script ever. What you will get is amazing visual design and effects (Godzilla, Mothra, and King Gidorah look amazing; Rodan is less stunning), awesome battles between humans and kaiju and between kaiju, bad dialogue that will nonetheless make you laugh out loud over and over. In short, it's a great monster movie. Don't expect any more than that and you will be delighted.

      "text": "Very loud, very dumb, and very entertainingThe third film in the \"MonsterVerse\" franchise, King of the Monsters is a direct sequel to Gareth Edwards's 2014 Godzilla (sadly, he didn't return as director), and sets up Godzilla vs. Kong, which is scheduled for release next summer. However, whereas Edwards held Godzilla back and made the action feel smaller by focalising it through the human characters, new director Michael Dougherty inverts that formula, putting Godzilla front and centre and shooting the action in such a way as to make it seem as grandiose as possible. He isn't half the director Edwards is, but King of the Monsters works well in a braindead summer action movie kind of way. Sure, there are significant problems (all the best shots are in the trailer, the plot is laughable, the characters are so thinly sketched as to make those in the first film feel Shakespearean), but all things considered, I enjoyed it.Five years since Godzilla defeated the MUTOs, many more creatures (now dubbed Titans) have been found in various forms of hibernation. In charge of studying and protecting them is Monarch Sciences (introduced in a fledgling state in Kong: Skull Island, which took place in 1973). However, when an eco-terrorist, Jonah Alan (Charles Dance) steals a bioacoustics device designed to communicate with the Titans, he uses it to awaken the only non-terrestrial Titan, a fearsome three-headed dragon known as King Ghidorah. Arguing that humanity has brought the planet to the point of destruction, Jonah believes that a global Titan conflict would wipe out most of human civilisation, allowing the planet the time it needs to heal. And so, as Ghidorah awakens the various Titans, Godzilla emerges to stand against him.Godzilla was originally conceived as a metaphor for the destructive power of nuclear weaponry, and King of the Monsters has one eye on its themes too (eco disaster, biodiversity, co-existence with other species, military impulsiveness). But really, the sermonising script by Dougherty and Zach Shields is so badly put together that any thematic concerns dissipate into nothing. And yes, it does address the fact that through inattention and greed, humanity is on the brink of ensuring its own extinction. The problem is that the eco themes are so preachy, they come across as background irrelevancies at best, and distracting moralising at worst.And there are other problems with the script. For example, not one, not two, but three characters sacrifice themselves for the greater good, resulting in none of the sacrifices really meaning anything. Another scene that doesn't work is the death of a major character, which happens so suddenly, amidst so much chaos, with the camera on even focused on them, that in the very next scene, the film has to show us their face on a monitor with the word \"Deceased\" written underneath. There are also far too many scenes of characters standing on the bridge of the Monarch flagship, the ARGO, spouting exposition at one another.There are also some spatial hijinks going on. I get that the ARGO is supposed to be  super-advanced, but it seems capable of flying from one side of the planet to the other in about ten minutes. Another issue is that Zhang Ziyi plays twins. Except I didn't even realise there were two of them until I read a few reviews. Sure, I noticed what I thought was a singular character appear to be in two places at once, but because the ARGO had already been globe-hopping, I just put it down to the film's lack of geographic realism. The fact that it's so easy to miss that there are twins is spectacularly bad writing.But for all that, I thoroughly enjoyed King of the Monsters. Although the trailer did promise what the film can't deliver on (Claude Debussy and pensive apocalypticism), aesthetically, there's a lot to admire. The sound design is suitably deafening, and Lawrence Sher's cinematography has a well-judged sense of scale, especially in the 2.39:1 3D IMAX format. The film also does some interesting things with colour, coding the Titans in binary elemental shades. There are also some extraordinary individual shots (most of which have been spoiled by the trailer); Mothra spreading her wings, Ghidorah perched atop a volcano with a crucifix in the foreground, the reveal of Godzilla's lair. And the final shot is a goosebumps moment with which no Kaiju fan could possibly be dissatisfied. Purely at the level of craft, this is a hugely impressive film.Citizen Kane it most certainly isn't, but who expected (or wanted) it to be. The key to really parsing it is to consider the context, looking at what it was trying to be. And in this sense, it's a success. Sure, the script is hideous, and Dougherty struggles to accomplish what Edwards did with ease; bring his own personality to the spectacle. However, if you approach it for what it is, a dumb summer blockbuster about large monsters punching each other, you'll like it just fine."

It tried to cover a lot of stuff from past Godzilla movies like the missile removing oxygen, which is how they killed him in the first Godzilla movie from 1954 to King Ghidorah being from Space. If I had one gripe about the movie is it played to hard on the one character trying to redeem her self at the end. I could had lived with out that whole family moment, just my opinion. Either way It was a really fun and great movie. Nice to see some of these creature get a proper treatment with modern special effects."
