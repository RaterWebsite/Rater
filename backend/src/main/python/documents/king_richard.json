While the movie obviously focuses on the father, it felt oddly clipped to end right at the beginning of the career of two sports legends.Smith does an admirable job as Richard, though he occasionally overacts. But you definitely feel and learn about Richard's humanity (the good and bad).The standout in this film is Aunjanue Ellis who plays the Williams mom, Brandi. She is by far the most believable, nuanced character; each of her scenes ground the film in reality. The best scene of the movie is where she and Richard get into an argument about their respective roles in the relationship and their impact on the girls' lives. She drives the scene, and Smith is (wisely) the passenger.Most of the other actors are either too amateurish or too over-the-top. Bernthal's portrayal of coach Rick was disappointingly cartoonish.As a biopic, it suffices, yet I rarely felt an emotional connection to Richard. I realize he was the driving force in the incredible rise of the Williams sisters, but I can't help but wonder if the story would've been more compelling if it were told from Brandi's perspective."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Will smith playing will smith..who has proved to be an overgrown toddler with serious issues."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "A trash boring oscar bait film, it was really disapoint.

It can be overbearing, but it\u2019s also nothing special.The movie starts with narration by Will Smith, but never is brought back. It could have just been a quote, but it probably would have been better and less distracting if it was just a written quote stated right before the film.The characters of the sisters of Venus and Serena pretty much had zero character. They were just supposed to be cute and supportive, and nothing else. It\u2019s all ready too long, but they could have edited some parts out to give them some actual personalities.(Also the scene with the \u201cfart joke\u201d was just so stupid, and the \u201cfart\u201d was the most standard, stock fart sound ever)"}, {"rating": "0", "text": "If you love unctuous, sanitised films about stage dads who propel their children to greater things for self-aggrandisement, and that sweep over deeply problematic realities in order to propel a lead actor to Oscar glory, then this is the film for you.

Through his stubbornness and determination, he shapes them into not just stars but pioneers and trailblazers for young girls everywhere. At first glance, it's a pretty standard biopic, but underneath, it has an unbelievable amount of charm and heart that make it both crowd-pleasing and inspiring. And on top of that, Will Smith gives one of his greatest and most touching performances to date, no doubt placing him as the Oscar frontrunner for best actor this year. At almost two and a half hours, it also takes its time and begins to drag at times, but should win most audiences over with its charm and performances. Overall, it's definitely worth a watch and you'd be hard-pressed to not find somebody who doesn't feel inspired by it by the end."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "One of the worst movies ever.

It's not something I have a problem with, because after all, what Richard Williams did is completely inspirational. He aspired to greatness for his daughters, even as difficult and strict as it can be said that his upbringing was for them.It's more than clear that the person who created you, who molded you, is a fundamental part of who you are, and it's even more noticeable when you have become such a great, monumental figure in sports as Venus and Serena Williams are.Especially when that person is your own father. Your own blood. And King Richard is a film that is dedicated to demonstrating that for most of its running time thanks to that fictional idealism that cinema indulges in real stories like this one. But even in the face of how uplifting and moving its story can be, and even with the outstanding performance of a Will Smith who is clearly aiming for an academy award nomination, both Venus and Serena are the real figures here, and when their journey is just beginning, this overlong film comes to an end.It gives the feeling of a cliffhanger for a sequel that I want to believe will never happen. Don't get me wrong, I liked this film, even with all the emotional manipulation that goes with it, but personally, I think the ones who should have gotten all the attention are the two women who have already etched their names in the history of their sport, and sports in general, not necessarily the man who drove them to achieve for success.Not that he wasn't important, but the biopic that really should have been produced, should have been about them."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Lost respect / oscar speech a joke / From now on I won't watch any movie with Will Smith.

And Smith reminds us just how good he can be, too. But he's also surrounded by a great cast of relative newcomers in the girls who play his daughters (and so convincingly at various ages), as well as seasoned actors who play the many people who cross paths with -- or just plain crossed -- \"King Richard\", including John Bernthal wonderfully playing against his tough-guy type. And although it doesn't quite get into the weeds of every gory detail, the film also doesn't shy away from showing that the King wasn't all nobility. Still, \"King Richard\" is likely to inspire you as much as it surprises you, and may even moveyou to tears on occasion. And with both Venus and Serena as Executive Producers to keep it honest, \"King Richard\" is engrossing from beginning to end, including some cool home movies incorporated into its credit reel. Which makes it 2 hours and 18 minutes of PG-13 rated biographical sports-drama that is a well-made drama first, making it a great watch even if you're not into sports generally or tennis specifically.\"King Richard\" is also available through HBO Max."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Can\u2019t say enough how great of a movie this was!

Great people tend to come from great parenting. May I am just biased.

Many celebrate this holiday by gathering with family over a sprawling meal and acknowledging the many blessings we've received throughout the year. Here's something I am thankful for: Will Smith's latest film, King Richard.Good segue, huh? Yes, I'm thankful for the movies - good and not as good. This season is chock full of family friendly entertainment, and King Richard provides an inspirational family/sports drama that can be enjoyed by the everyone around the dinner table. Here's how I see it.King Richard tells the remarkable story of how Richard Williams (Will Smith) created and executed a plan of turning his youngest daughters, Venus (Saniyya Sidney) and Serena Williams (Demi Singleton), into tennis superstars. The Williams family lives in Compton. They have limited financial resources to access the best coaching, equipment and courts needed to foster tennis talent; but Richard Williams is very resourceful and headstrong as he doggedly pursues his goal of making Venus and Serena tennis champions. Richard has the support of his wife, Oracene Williams (Aunjanue Ellis), as they struggle to raise 5 daughters in the hardscrabble and dangerous life of Compton all while navigating the roadblocks to tennis stardom. If you've paid attention to any tennis in the last 20 or so years, you know how it turns out.Will Smith does a great job of embodying Richard Williams. While the accent and posture are a little off-putting in the beginning, you quickly relax into the performance. Smith is able to portray this determined father, who suffers from tunnel vision, some self-centered arrogance with a touch of narcissism; but, he's also disarming in an oddly charming way. Smith gives a centered performance that highlights how effectively Williams is able to support and parent his daughters through their success. While Smith is the main character, the remainder of the cast is uniformly good. Please, somebody, give Aunjanue Ellis all of the awards and accolades she deserves. She is so good here as she matches Smith's performance beat for beat. Ellis is as fierce and warm as she needs to be. I'll also note that Saniyya Sidney is wonderful. She has some really winning moments throughout the movie.King Richard is almost 2 and a half hours long. That usually gives me pause because a good story can be told in less than 2 hours. Even though this movie's runtime is that long, it never drags. The editing of this film keeps it moving - never boring the audience and always maintaining the dramatic tension inherent in this true story. The tennis matches are infused with energy and show the talent of these powerhouse players. It all comes together to make 2 and a half hours breeze by.Side Note: Stay for the Beyonce end credit song and great footage of the real-life Venus, Serena and Richard Williams.Unabashedly, I'm a fan of King Richard. It tells a remarkable and inspirational story. Even though you know what kind of success this family achieves, it is still exciting to watch throughout. Richard Williams is a fascinating character that Will Smith plays well. The entire cast is aces. This is a film that the entire family can enjoy together over the weekend. Grab a big box of popcorn whether you are at the theater or streaming on HBO Max."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Its a great Movie about a Man and a Father who works his Butt off to get his Kids away from the street.

The cast did an amazing job telling this incredible story"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "King Richard, the movie, is too cute and too nice. While that is certainly not a bad thing, it does make one feel as if it's only one side of the story. It seems to deliberately avoid the difficulties that surrounded the Williams household and particularly the man himself, only alluding to those challenges sparingly.Mr. Williams is at the least a colorful character and he's definitely something. I am unsure what exactly but he sure is something and sadly, there's a lot of him that's not in the movie. However, Will Smith's delicate portrayal of the man smoothens his rough edges and portrays his driven & emotional side in a way that many people can relate to.But, if all of Richard Williams is not in the movie, then it is lost what exactly is the focus. Is it just tennis? The Williams household? Venus? Serena? Both of them? A lot of the time it seems the movie is a mixture of the aforementioned; intermittently mixing and matching, never committing to one singular perspective. And this feels like the focus of the movie is constantly shifting.Notwithstanding, King Richard does offer up some deeply emotional and moving scenes that really put you right there with the family. It is in these scenes the movie shines and unsurprisingly all those scenes have Will Smith in them. Unfortunately, other times are not as committed and by the end the plot does seem a little unfinished."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "King Richard is an absolute triumph. A truly incredible sports drama on every front that is sure to please all audiences.

Will Smith is the best he has ever been. It's an inspirational and uplifting story that balances emotion, humour, drama and suspense perfectly. Undoubtedly one of my favourites of the year."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Amazing film.
