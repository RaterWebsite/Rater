Not able to resist temptation, the kids begin to play the grisly game but soon make a chilling connection -- they are each being murdered one-by-one in the same way as the characters they played in the game.

This is never even addressed apparently she just looked down from her tower and said \"well all the young kids are into the videa games I guess thats as good a way to kill them as any\" The other thing is at the end how the game imitates real life. I just can't believe malcom in the middle drops a crow bar in the game and it appears in life. Another problem with the movie is who the hell named these people? With great names like Hutch, October, Swink and Phineus. This group of friends had the worst parents ever. Another issue was the romance between Abby and Hutch. It seemed very forced and really stupid. The last problem was after the characters figured out that if they die in the game they die in real life they make the logical choice to just stop playing the game. So the movie comes out and just says \"no, you stop I will just play for you. Yeah that will work\" Through out the movie it seemed very forced and just hard to believe.

Anyway, I would give this one the benefit of the doubt. But I have to wonder: in this era of production synergy, where is the game to tie in to this movie? I have a feeling the game would be more fun to play than having to sit through the inevitable sequel."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "[***SPOILERS***] If you've seen the television ads for this dreadful flick, you've already seen the best it has to offer. Don't waste your money on the price of a ticket. \"Stay Alive\" is poor film making at its worst. We're talking about one scene in which a boom mike is visible, and another in which a profile shot of an actress reveals a large orange object (an earplug, I think) in her left ear. It's THAT kind of bad. It's the kind of bad film making in which characters have knowledge of conversations that took place while they were elsewhere. Phineas, for instance, has been out driving while the rest of the cast has been talking about how people are dying when they die in \"the game,\" yet when he receives a call on his cell phone responds that he'll be alright because \"That's right! I haven't died in the game!\" It's the kind of bad film making that puts a notorious Elizabethan-era mass murderer (Elizabeth Bathory) in New Orleans and changes the name of a very famous book about witch hunting, \"Maleus Malificarum,\" to \"Maleus Demonium\" but forgets to change the title of the book that a character is holding in her hands WHILE she is telling someone else about the contents of the book. It's the kind of bad film making wherein the performances are so paper-thin that, clearly, if this were bad in any sort of memorable way (instead of merely being sloppy and formulaic), Frankie Muniz would surely be up for a Razzie for his stilted, twitchy, downright annoying performance. It's the kind of bad that has the main weapons of the oh-so-horrible ghostly antagonist turn out to be a pair of scissors and a horse-drawn carriage that can be vaporized by throwing a rose at it. It's the kind of bad that has a main character suddenly blurt out her entire life story while riding in a van with no apparent provocation, and her story has absolutely no connection to anything in the rest of the movie at all. None. WHY? Clearly, the writers were unable to string together anything coherent here. To make matters worse, the film takes itself seriously yet fails utterly to deliver on the gore. There isn't a single good scare in the film; it's all hand-on-the-shoulder, bump-in-the-night stuff here. In fact, we never really see a death scene other than one or two knife strokes. Most of the time, the lights go out, there's a scream, and suddenly another one's bit the dust. Either that or a quick cutaway. Truly gutless stuff here. No doubt the producers realized that nobody over the age of 14 would buy into this pablum and decided to go after a PG-13 rating. I've heard stories told around campfires that were ten times as scary as this mess. Even the special effects look cartoonish, and real video games have better graphics than most of what we see in \"Stay Alive.\" \"Stay Alive\" is bad in every conceivable way. The patently predictable ending of this lurching wreck of a movie leaves open the possibility of a sequel, of course. I doubt there will be one, though, because I can't imagine anyone wanting to sit through another two hours of something as bad as this. We're talking \"Darkness Falls\" and \"Fear Dot Com\" bad stuff here. Save your money. The most frightening thing about \"Stay Alive\" is the price of admission."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Call me crazy but I loved this movie! I can't believe all of the negative reviews it's recieved. I saw it with four friends who loved it as well. It was very terrifying at times (scored a few screams in the theater), but also very funny. The characters were amazing, as was the acting, especially Sophia Bush as October. The death scenes were not very bloody (the whole film was cut down to avoid an R rating, so I'm looking forward to the original director's cut on DVD), but they were creepy enough to give you chills. You'll never look at video games the same way again. So \"Stay Alive\" definitely gets a 10/10 from me."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This movie was really good. It made me jump a few times in my seat, and I also love how it was based on a real pesron. Making it more scary than it would be if it was based on someone from the writers own imagenations.

Considering what has come out in the past including House of Wax and the Amittyville Horror, this movie has a stable plot with generally good acting.

It's Like Brainscan Meets Silent Hill Coming Together In A Very Enjoyable (And Creepy) Way!I am a fan of horror. In these later years, there has been a proliferation of bad horror movies on the market. Most begin with four or five kids, heading to a remote location for a weekend, they are stalked by whatever antagonist, and all die but one or two of them. Voilas, there is the rote formula for nearly all your B-class horrors of the last two decades.This one starts out with six or so kids, and therefore, I was expecting nothing whatsoever in the way of innovation or fun. I thought I would be writing a different kind of review than the one I am currently writing.While the premise used in Stay Alive is nothing new, it feels a bit like the original Saw in its atmosphere, without plodding. It feels a lot like Brainscan in its realism, without coming off campy. But more importantly, it feels quite a bit like Silent Hill in its atmosphere, without leading us into the pseudo-religious, dogma-filled prattlings.In essence? This was one creepy little film, if you can allow yourself to become involved in the story, that is. But you must suspend disbelief in order to let yourself be drawn into most any cinematic work.Above the atmosphere, which is the real star of the work, the story itself is quite compelling. Beyond the premise, which HAS been done before, the plot itself is pretty fresh, and goes a long way towards preventing this work from feeling rehashed, recycled, or otherwise done and done.I have to say that I enjoy this venture to the fullest. It has some VERY tense moments, features some great (although wholly goreless and pretty much bloodless) kills, and delivers a fine execution of the concept."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Swink: I just figured out how to strip one of those zombie concubines naked.

Could be better if they were to go back into the game as a group, after Phineus died. The cops should of been involved somehow at the end also, as these deaths aren't going to be dismissed. I like the characters, but unfortunately the more enjoyable personalities are the ones that die.
