There is a sense of wonder in this film. There is the wonder of seeing so many strange alien beings who are truly aliens, and not just bipedal humanoid of varying colours. There is the wonder of seeing different acrologies and biomes. There is the wonder of seeing genuinely funny scenes that are not deliberate or forced, but tickles you in the right place. If the sci-fic genre, in whatever medium, is supposed to instil a sense of wonder in the audiences, then this film is the quintessential sci-fi film."

Then this came up, with Luc Besson as the director I was really excited to watch it.I never read the comic book, but as far as comic goes, European comics have really unique style and story. Probably because they didn't reach the mainstream audience much. And lots of french movies are great, so at least these facts get me higher hope for the movie.But... the very bottom line is that I was wrong to expect Valerian as \"spiritual successor\" of Fifth Element. I'm guessing this is a very idealist project, sort of like James Cameron's Avatar.Something that has been around Luc Besson's head for awhile, but the technology wasn't up to it back when he came up with the idea.So the execution? The CG are wonderful, but that's pretty much all of it. Action sequences are not impactful, even Transformers Last Knight still did it better. No witty dialogue or hilarious/memorable moments such as when Ruby Rod interviewing Korben Dallas. The story is a jumbled mess too.If you want to feast your eyes again after Avatar did it to you, this will satisfy your thirst at least partially.But this ain't no Fift Element."

Sadly, this is a film that could be improved by redoing the dialogue and voice acting, so it may do much better in dubbed versions overseas if the writers and voice actors are skilled."

Valerian is played by guy who tries too hard to be badass, it sounds like he's forcing his voice to be lower and the outcome is ridiculous. Also he doesn't look badass at all. He sounds like he had stuffed nose the whole time. That girl... this was also a poor choice. She can't act, but on top of that she has incredibly irritating face. Eyebrows in particular. She was just ugly. I couldn't look at her, it was just annoying. Finally we get to Rihanna, who was just put there. No reason for her to be there, it was some kind of marketing stunt I suppose. She didn't fit in her role, she was just there to show off. From all of this I got the sensation that those actors were just forcibly fit into these roles, because how come the CGI generated characters were far better in acting!? This film could be epic."

I don't know if it was because they were poorly written or the actors just didn't fit the role well at all.

Oh, maybe because the director Luc Besson decided to work in the area where he does not understand at all? He decided to write a script... I think this is the main problem of the film - a weak screenplay. Or rather complete absence of adequate screenplay. I put zero for this movie because I could not watch more than 27 minutes. watch longer, just unbearable"

Quite why they have teens piloting the spaceships, and a whole galaxy depending on them, when a whole host of better suited people are around them is never explained. Then you are also expected to believe that the lead actor is some sort of lothario, and that his partner is besotted with him, but they both are completely wooden and there is no chemistry between them. The story then muddles around for a bit without purpose and Rhianna pops up for a cameo appearance to plug a song in a sequence that should have been left on the cutting room floor. The final act has no surprises and you can see what is coming from a mile off, it ends with a bizarre conclusion, and the fakest most unconvincing  love scene I've ever seen in a film. Cara Delevingne rolls her eyes and acts bratish a lot and Dane DeHaan very unconvincingly plays the tough guy. Such a shame as I thought the concept had a lot of potential."

And it's surprising that a film so jammed with fantastic visuals can fall so flat. Two humans (Dane DeHaan and Cara Delevingne) have a mission to save the titular metropolis and ultimately the universe. This is another setback: DeHaan has none of the charm or charisma of an adventure hero and his chemistry with Delevingne never sparks. But most surprising is that director Luc Besson, who's best known for action series (Taken, The Transporter), has created such anemic encounters here. There's plenty of running and fighting, but it's never staged with any creativity or excitement.  Even the remarkable sci-fi elements that are crammed into every frame lose some of their spark after a while, plus the mundane writing and leaden drama dilute any appeal offered by the dazzling (and sometimes derivative) imagery."

      "text": "The main problem with Valerian is that it's less of a sci-fi movie than it is a really dumb romantic comedy that just happens to have aliens and technology letting you exist and travel through several dimensions at once (used for an action scene early on, then NEVER becomes relevant later on, when it would've solved A LOT of problems.) Moreover, it's a romantic comedy whose lead characters are openly callous (ignoring allies getting killed as a direct result of their action in favour of more \"flirty\" chitchat) and are so unlikeable you totally do not care whether or not they get together.Yet, this is all the plot is interested in: most of their shared dialogue is creepy \"flirting\", and very little screentime is devoted to addressing their supposed mission as opposed to them having to rescue each other from completely irrelevant doldrums that only exist to cram in more action scenes and give other characters a chance to pontificate on their supposed love and how they should be together. It's sickening, especially when practically all those side characters are a lot more interesting than these leads (with the exception of THREE Jar Jar clones that crop up way too often, especially for a film made a whole decade after Star Wars prequels concluced.) I suppose all of these flaws were probably present in the source material (1960's French comic book just called \"Valerian and Laureline\"), but that doesn't make it look any better on screen.The \"main plot\" to do with their missions, or what there is of one, is also not great to say the least: it's something like a cross between Avatar and that Star Trek movie about whales, with a very pointedly \"noble savage\"-like race (though again, that might have looked fresh and topical when it came out and hippies were all the rage), and what now seems like parallels refugee crisis, but at the time was probably intended to mirror Algerian and Indochina wars France went through at the time, and likely nuclear testing as well. While it would've probably still looked silly, it might've been compelling if more screentime was devoted to developing these ideas, as opposed to all the reasoning being dumped in the 10 minutes close at the end."

Some of the creatures in the film looked very similar to Luc Besson\u2019s other movie \u201cThe Fifth Element\u201d, which was a nice throw back.  The main protagonists were not as memorable or likeably as some of the other space operas, but good enough to move the plot along. I didn\u2019t mind Dane Dehann, but I can honestly say I have not like Cara Delevingne acting in any of the movies I have seen her in. She frankly comes across as wooden with most of her lines.    If I had to take one good thing from Valerian other than the visuals, I would say the technology concepts were cool. It was the first Sci Fi film in a while to really show me advance technology concepts that felt alien.  Overall if you like Sci Fi films you will probably find enjoyment in this one, if you\u2019re a fan of a more emotionally deep film then this one is passable."

However, this is definitely not a film for everyone, it is outlandish and bizarre and will often contradict its own world's rules several times in the same scene. You should definitely go in with more of a Monty Python mentality and less of a Star Wars mentality. The only major issue I had was with a 30-minute plot cul de sac right in the middle of the film. Rihanna shows up for a goofy and awkward side story that should have been completely cut from the final film; it merely provides a long distraction from the main plot and adds nothing to the overarching story. I love that she's bringing people into the theaters for fun action sci-fi films like Battleship and Valerian, but they're clearly creating custom characters for her that just aren't very good. I loved everything before she shows up and after she leaves."

I'm a long time fan of the French comic book series and I feel like this did pretty good justice.

      "text": "Valerian and the City of A Thousand Planets is perhaps the greatest example of style over substance in modern film history.Luc Besson is such a huge fan of the comic book source material he has worked tirelessly to bring the film to the big screen, seeking funding from multiple independent bodies to make it the most expensive indie movie of all time. Unfortunately for the director, the end result is an absolute mess.The film starts with a spectacular montage telling 400 years of exposition as the titular city slowly grows from an Earth space station. Soundtracked by David Bowie\u2019s Space Oddity, this is by far the best sequence of the film. Unfortunately, it\u2019s all down hill from there.Despite some genuinely great visual artistry, Valerian is spoiled by stilted dialogue, a meandering plot and two horribly miscast leads.It\u2019s hard to think of an on-screen couple with less chemistry than Dane DaHaan and Cara Delevingne as Valerian and Laureline.After the initial exposition of the opening scenes, it is their relationship that is the key focus of the film, with the plot very much secondary.Unfortunately, the pair have no spark whatsoever and just sort of say their lines at each other in wooden, bland exchanges that are often cringe worthy and painful to watch.Dane DeHann can be good, his performance in Chronicle gave us a glimpse at a realistic super-villain origin story, and for the first half of The Amazing Spider-Man 2 he made a pretty credible Harry Osborne. Here though it becomes clear that \u2018swash-buckling, womanising, space agent\u2019 is not in his repertoire. The actor is just lacking that elusive quality that you can\u2019t really teach\u200a\u2014\u200acharisma.Delevingne is another story all together. At this point I\u2019ve seen two of her cinematic outings\u200a\u2014\u200alast year\u2019s Suicide Squad and now Valerian. So for me, she is two for two in terms of god awful, wooden and almost film killing performances. It\u2019s hard to get into specifics but from what I can tell she doesn\u2019t seem to get how \u2018acting\u2019 works beyond wearing the clothes she\u2019s told to wear and saying the words she\u2019s told to say. As I said though, I haven\u2019t seen Paper Towns for all I know she could be great, judging by Valerian though, it doesn\u2019t look likely.As the film moves on the plot about the wrongful near extinction of a species fades into the background. When it does resurface the plotting and painfully basic dialogue can barely keep it chugging along. For the most part though, the film is concerned with Valerian and Laureline and how much they care about each other/work well together/should be a couple etc. none of which works due to the aforementioned lack of chemistry.Ultimately Valerian comes across as a poor man\u2019s Guardians of the Galaxy and essentially shows us what might have been given some alternative casting. The reason both Guardians films work so well is the interplay between the characters, without that the films would have just been a mixture of bright colours and fun noises, and that is basically what Valerian has ended up as.Even the visual flare of the earlier scenes gives way about half way through proceedings. After setting up a huge universe full of different species and alien environments, Besson for some reason decides we should spend the back half in the dimly lit sewers and underbelly of \u2018The City of A Thousand Planets\u2019.The final nails in the coffin are a couple of bizarre cameo appearances from Rihanna and Ethan Hawke (what are you doing?)I would say Rihanna\u2019s inclusion drags the film down but the leads are already doing a pretty good job of that themselves. Instead, her section is another speed bump in a film that makes 2 hours and change feel like an eternity.By the time the final battle gets going, we\u2019re all past the point of caring and no amount of laser gun fights and killer robots can save us (and they usually save everything).I\u2019m sure Valerian will have its supporters from its pre-existing fan base, but the terrible casting accompanied by a script that has clearly been written by someone without a full grasp of the English language means it has ended up as a convoluted mess without enough flair or imagination to make it worthwhile.There is something to be said for films that are \u2018so bad they\u2019re good\u2019 (see my Fast and Furious 8 review for further details). Valerian, however, is just plain bad. Maybe it will become a cult classic in the future, ultimately though the film will always go down as a missed opportunity. If, for whatever reason, you do end up watching it, I have one piece of advice\u200a\u2014\u200ain your head recast Dane DeHann and Cara Delevingne with Tom Hiddleston and Emma Stone. Better isn\u2019t it?"

From such promise, however, Besson provides a film which falls so spectacularly short of expectations as to induce an incandescent rage at having to endure the inexorable torment of futile hope that something, anything, might redeem the experience and justify your time. The pacing is lethargic and the editing lacks coherence, the script is utterly woeful, and the chemistry between the lead couple is more akin to siblings than lovers (decidedly not of the Lannister variety!) making for some excruciating moments. Performances are wooden and without charm, and the desired social and political commentary languishes in unsophisticated banality, devoid of any emotional resonance. The storyline had some brief moments of promise, but the plot is a sieve, and whilst there is some excellent creature design and moments of cinematic grandeur, these are few and far between and fail to redeem the film from the inconsistent abyss of boring mediocrity in which it wallows. 3.23/10"

The setting: as title said, this is a movie about \"the city of thousand planet\", however, the story itself doesn't adapt such nice setting. The story has nothing to do with this \"the city of thousand planet\". If I change this movie to \"Valerian and The death star\" it still works. Such a waste!Let's talk about what is good.1. CG. Like some users said above, the director is going to have the same life where Zack Snyder will live the rest of his life. The CGI is good. However this is not a selling point in 2017. I promise you if we put this movie in 2008, that's a winner. As for today, it is really not important.2. Cara Delevingne. Holy **** I just can't stop looking at her the whole movie, she got all my attention and I don't really care about what on earth this movie is talking about. she is so pretty. HEY, why this is called \"Valerian and the city of a thousand planets\". Change to \"Laureline and the city of a thousand planets\" please.3. Rihanna. That's the best 5 mins in the movie. You will know what I am talking about if you go watching this movie.Overall, this is a fine movie worth your 5 dollar ticket. The movie is full of amazing idea but the director didn't make it in good use.I will give it a 6 and 1 extra points for Sergeant Laureline."

If you're looking for a deep, challenging, dark, or thought-provoking film, this is not going to satisfy you.  This is sci-fi at its most campy and imaginative, which can be so entertaining if you're open to it!"

It is a great movie for any sci-fi lovers out there, giving a fresh and bold twist to the typical space adventures. Definitely a must watch for those who are looking for something new and unorthodox."

This was a fun movie with cooler aliens than Star Wars. Actors did a great job with a script that wasn't as bad as some say. Worth the price of admission. I want another movie."

The troopers in this space opera can actually aim!!I feel maybe 15 minutes could have been shaved off, with its weakest points being Rihanna's sub-plot and some needless mushiness in the final act. Still, it wasn't enough to stop me from enjoying the film and talking over certains scenes with my wife.Despite a few cheesy lines, the relationship between the two lead actors felt pretty realistic to me, a husband of 6 years.Side-Note: Valerian came well before Star Wars...best recognize and respect :p"

      "text": "Overall the movie was very disappointing. Mostly due to the story and the two main protagonists. However, the basic setting (i.e. the city of a thousand planets) in which the story takes place is interesting and is the only reason why I awarded any points to this movie. Taking Avatar as a benchmark, I evaluate the movie the following way: The development of the plot is way below the benchmark and not convincing. At no moment i was touched or surprised by the story: It just didnt make any sense. The acting was below the benchmark. The relation between the protagonist seemed artificial: The \"romance\"  is rather ridiculous and  convinced me at no point of time. My conclusion is: if you expect something comparable to Avatar, you will be extremely disappointed. If you expect a good and convincing plot, you will be extremely disappoined. If you expect a few nice pictures, and a few funny moments, you will be satisfied. For me personally watching this movie was a waste of both time and money."

It was like eating rice cakes. Flavorless, tasteless and having the texture of styrofoam. This is nowhere as good as \"The Fifth Element\", which was a mind-blowing spectacle that broke all kinds of barriers for the sci-fi genre. Think of this as a lite, a very lite version of that movie from 20 years ago. Remember that Wendy's commercial from the 1980's - Where's the beef?"

      "text": "Sometimes I just don't get the critics. Is it because this movie is French? Does the Hollywood blockbusters industry feel threatened in any way by a French movie other than from the independant movance? It is really to be wondered when you read the critic of that guy in the Hollywood Reporter. Everybody is entitled to its own opinion to be sure, but I'm puzzled by such subjectivity. Praising random Blockbusters with no imagination whatsoever and crappy plot and litterally destroying one (arrgh French) with imagination, crasy effects and original premises. Yes, for sure, the scenario could have been maybe refined in some places, but nothing that justify a 20 whereas other movies with nothing more than this one (Guardian of Galaxies opus 1 for example? with its pushy and already seen pushline like \"Oh yeah!!\"). I mean, really? One thing people, once again everybody is entitled to his/her opinion, but give it a try. Don't let those shamy critics discourage you to watch that movie. And then, if you don't like it, you're perfectly entitled to that and I would be very much interested to read a review with constructive critics! Not those crappy review of so-called professionals. Cheers!"
