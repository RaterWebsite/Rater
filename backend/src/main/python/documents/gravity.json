  "description": "Dr. Ryan Stone, a brilliant medical engineer on her first Shuttle mission, with veteran astronaut Matt Kowalsky in command of his last flight before retiring. But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The Shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone-tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness of space. The deafening silence tells them they have lost any link to Earth and any chance for rescue. As fear turns to panic, every gulp of air eats away at what little oxygen is left. But the only way home may be to go further out into the terrifying expanse of space.",

HOLY HELL it was spectacularly done. For a setting that has no sound and to make it seem that way is a feet that is out of this world (sorry for the pun). It may sound easy just to remove the Atmos effects but really, having done sound for TV myself it is very difficult to cover up. This is a film I will take notes from in the future."

      "text": "Intense and gripping!  This movie was shot as a simple survival story in space...  but I connected to it even more at a much deeper level.  The way that the cinematography was shot, I felt I was in space floating with Sandra Bullock's character, Dr. Ryan Stone... that was a technical achievement in itself...  But  I was also able to feel what it was like to be in the mind of her character.  I feared with her, struggled to survive with her, felt the hopelessness of life and accepted death with her, and then, found air, found new life, and was born again with her.  Sandra Bullock has put on an Oscar worthy performance, and it sure did help with Alfonso Cuaron being at the helm to guide this film.  What a genius.  It's been awhile since I've been deeply absorbed into the thoughts and feelings of a character on screen.  This movie was truly a journey and an experience into the mind and soul of Dr. Ryan Stone's character.  Wow, such an amazing film.  An unforgettable experience!  Must see in theaters with the biggest screen you can find."

We saw it in 3-D, but each of us fell asleep several times. When we woke up, more of the same...Sandra frantically pushing buttons in Russian and then Mandarin, hoping that she pushed the right one. When she was floating in space, she desperately reached for parts of the three space stations, and fortunately was able to grab something at the last minute. Big surprise.\rThere was about 10 minutes of interaction with Clooney, but the rest of it was her mumbling to herself. Waaayyyy overrated."

Given the overthrowing praise the film is receiving, countless thousands will waste 90 minutes of their life wading through this oddly lifeless film.  The tedious screenplay evokes the worst of James Cameron but adds hundreds of Sandra Bullock \"Aaaaahs.\"  Water boarding couldn't be this painful. By the 30 minutes mark you will be begging that a massive asteroid pulverize any survivors on screen; by the 60 minute mark you will beg for the 3D effects to deliver an asteroid to your own skull.

Too much of it takes place inside spacecraft that isn't functioning properly, and Bullock's hapless, rather unlikable character had me drumming my fingers, wanting to just doze off, and wondering how long we would be subjected to her suffering and fiddling futilely about.  Her tedious character is in most scenes; Clooney has more life, but disappears early on, and returns only briefly.  Might be worth seeing for the occasional beauty of it, if you don't expect anything in the way of story or character development."

Two things I loved in this movie were the cinematography as a whole and the action sequences. The effects were good and the camera angles/shots were fantastic, and the action sequences were well-produced. However, this does not make up for this movie's mediocre plot. The story was extremely repetitive, very simple, and somewhat boring. Along with the underachieving plot, I thought that Clooney's acting was uninspired and lazy, Bullock over-acted to the point that she got very annoying and unconvincing, there was minimal character development, and I did not feel any sympathy for the characters. While this movie had some of the best cinematography I have seen in a while, the rest of it was poorly done. This movie is not worthy of any oscars other than cinematography, and truly is not worth your time."

Actually the 3D is probably the best 3D i've seen in a movie. Also, I can't name any other movie that would be about Space, but not about aliens or a catastrophic end of the world (the end of Facebook in this picture probably does not count). They took an interesting idea and made a cliche movie out of it. That is why I can only give it a 5, maybe a 5.5 due to the fact that they managed to make it with only two and a half actors.The movie is not bad, it's just not very interesting and very cliche in the details of the plot. I would give it a 7 or 8 if they removed all the psychological crap you see in teenage movies about \"being unable to move on\"."

The action and all aspects of this film were very artistic and beautiful. The acting was hard to judge because of the space helmets, but the voice acting that you could hear through the com was realistic and helped add to the suspense and emotions of the film. The problem with this film is that you don't really care about the characters. They seem like amazing people walking around in space, and you get to know a little bit about their home lives, but it just wasn't enough. Really the story was all premise, which I find rather boring and aggravating in a film. 2 people floating around above the earth trying to get back home. That really is all there is to the story, so it gets pretty boring. Add to that the complete lack of an interesting compelling script, and you get a movie the was pretty pointless. If all you need is good visuals, then you will love this film, if you need something a bit more sophisticated, then you will hate it. I would have rated this film higher for the visuals and technology, but seeing as it is already extremely overrated I will just give it a zero."

The effects of course are amazing and the cinematography, I will say, is phenomonal... everything from the pre-production to the filming to the post must have been mind numbing for the filmmakers, but to me, a movie has to have the following to be good;\r1. characters you care about... not in this one.\rStarting the film in space was not smart. I don't know if they were trying to set some sort of record of having the smallest cast, which it already doesn't, if you've seen 'Buried' you will know what I am talking about. Well maybe there were 2 people in that I'm not sure. Anyways, you never really felt for the main characters... you don't care if these people go off into space... I mean I guess unless you care about Sandra Bullock and George Clooney personally...\r2. Morals. Yes, it did have a very obvious moral; never give up. But it didn't change my outlook on anything really... Just a simple pretty basic message.\r3. a great story with a creative way of telling it, along with brilliant individual scenes. You should be able to leave the theater asking your fellow movie goers which part they liked best. In this you can say \"when she's breathing a lot\" or \"when she almost dies by the inconvenient debris which never ever happens but for some reason has happened to 3 different shuttles in the past hour\"\r4. Music that connects you with the characters, and with the moment, and how you should be feeling... you need a GREAT composer if you want a great movie.\r I'm tired of all these films coming out that are so critically acclaimed, but for what? Where are the films where you leave the theater just thinking about it over and over, where the film really sticks with you? Where are the films that you can leave thinking to yourself, \"wow, that will be a classic?\" I mean maybe in past generations, all the films they saw they just said \"eh\" and now we think they are classics... but if not then I'm just disappointed. Maybe I'm not as deep of a thinker as the critics, but all I can say about this film is it probably took a very very long time to get these special effects down... but honestly... I've seen more visually stunning things at OMSI, and Disneyland, and most rides at Universal Studios. I don't know why people are saying this is a once in a generation movie... It is certainly not one I will remember too well."

      "text": "I watched this movie yesterday or the night before last and, frankly, I was a bit divided about it. I expected something more. The script is simple: in the near future, a severe blast causes a chain reaction destroying most orbiting satellites and launching a shower of space debris compromising the survival of a team of American astronauts who were repairing the Hubble Telescope. It's a plot that works but has serious credibility problems based on the great improbability of all our satellites being destroyed at the same time. It also totally ignores some science issues such as the abundance of space junk in Earth's orbit and has a plot hole that rubs the absurd: how the astronauts were able to listen to dogs in China if they were not even able to communicate with the own base in Houston? Sandra Bullock is the main character, in the role of a scientist who was selected for that mission by being an expert on the subject. The actress is good and her quality is unquestionable but I think her character wasn't well thought. Despite being a rookie in space and showing little training, her character is able to decently decouple herself in a ISS shuttle and in a Chinese one, something her training would probably never have prepared her for not being strictly necessary to her mission. There is a latent contradiction here, and it does not to be a physical or a genius to realize that and to detect others in the film. George Clooney is a good supporting actor but sometimes his posture, somewhat childish and relaxed, prevented me from actually feeling any tension, not to mention that the way he dies is absolutely clich\u00e9. The direction of Alfonso Cuaron works reasonably, and I think I realized some scenes that intentionally copy great films of the past in order to to honor them. This is beautiful and symbolic. The end of the film also seems loaded with symbolism.The technical issue, however, is beyond reproach. CGI is absolutely grand and the images of our planet are breathtaking. I liked cinematography and soundtrack, discrete but competent. The way they put the actors floating weightless also seems incredible and realistic, just like the ships, tools, space suits and even the floating debris. Visually, the film is powerful and realistic but it's not the first time I say this: it's not a CGI storm that makes a good movie. The script has to be good. And the fact is that the script of this film, although it works, has a lot of holes, errors, absurd moments and contradictions. No matter how improbable is the situation the movie shows, the audience has to feel that it's real and it's happening. And I could not feel it here."

It promises to deliver, and after the first 5 minutes you are catapulted into an adventure filled with exquisite beauty and moments that will have you holding your breath."

I actually thought they filmed this in space because it was SO realistic. George Clooney was great and funny even in the most serious parts of the film, and Sandra Bullock made it so realistic! It totally attacked my emotions and I felt physically and mentally exhausted afterwards. I recommend this to everyone and it may sound like a boring old space movie but it will blow you away!!! I highly recommend this so go watch it NOW!!"
