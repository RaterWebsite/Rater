      "text": "Just the right amount of nostalgia and campy fun.\r For most movies, being formulaic would be a flaw. This is not the case with Goosebumps, it takes full advantage of the nostalgia effect and instead of going for edgy dark atmosphere, it stays within the boundary of its fun juvenile antics. It brings mild comedy of horror with surprisingly decent visual effect as well as healthy amount of witty jokes.\r The set-up itself will be a reminiscence of retro horror and 90s gimmicks. From the quiet suburban life where the sneaker-wearing teen protagonists would wander off due to boredom, the strangely oblivious adults who only realize the dire problem far too late and all the PG-13 monsters, it just reeks of nostalgia. However, the movie also balances this with a few modern touches so it would be accessible to previous and current generation.\r Plot isn't complicated, the trailer or synopsis pretty much script the whole thing. Monsters from the book roam a once peaceful city and a merry band of teens must save it from destruction. There are a few developments here and there, but none too major or shocking which is understandable for family movie. Granted, there are a couple of plot holes or a few scenes where it feel too frantic, but audience would mostly be lenient considering the silly nature of the movie.\r Its greatest asset aside nostalgia is the humor. The cast does a fine job delivering the timely quips and awkward situations even during chaotic danger, or rather it works from the irony of being in such danger. There's surprisingly good chemistry between them, beyond just stereotypical teen escapades. Jack Black does his usual eccentric persona. While it's not great, it's presentable, plus the movie needs a big name for push.\r Goosebumps is arguably predictable and can be hectic at times, yet it has sufficient nostalgia charm and witty humor for an entertaining family oriented adventure comedy."

The acting and story are pretty standard and this one is a great example of a film that takes literally zero risks. However, the film remains cute and entertaining, plus the special effects are very cool. Plus, as someone who loved the Goosebumps books, it was cool to see the monsters I read about come to life on the big screen. Finally, the lore behind their existence and all that is pretty interesting and compelling, so points for that. Overall, Goosebumps will entertain, but certainly not wow at any moment.

      "text": "Now, I know what everyone reading this is thinking. And yes, the whole concept of giving this film a dirty zero, may shock some, \"may\". But in all reality, I'm not merely attention seeking. Because believe me, there are many attention whores out there, lurking on this web, giving dishonest and overall baffling reviews, especially when it comes to actual decent movies. Now, if you truly wish to continue reading this, get prepared, because I'm going all the **** out on this piece of ****ery film! And I don't give a jack **** about what you think, okay?\r So, to begin on why I think this film deserves to suck on some sexy testicles sacks, I'll start with the overall concept they were trying to go for here.  As you've already been informed, it's a film about the author of the original, unaltered Goosebump books. Now, I haven't actually read the books, yet. But I can tell they were mixing and searching through their best and brightest ideas, to ultimately create a classic of a film. And honestly, it could've been something to remember.\rJumanji did it much better. Here's why: it blandly panders to the teenage demographic, with frequent pop culture references and unnecessary and inappropriate jokes, that barely mix in with the actual film's true nature. For instance: the whole \"new kid\" on the block concept has been done in almost literally every 1980's/1990's movie. We're past this, this is 2015. Regardless, it's obviously ripping off many other films, most likely better than it.\r Another bugger - Jack Black may have given it his all, and you can tell through his acting in this film. But he was still an overpaid, wasteful use in this title, only casting him because people will see it. And I did, sadly. And this, I just wanted to go back, watch all the wonders of our time. Is that truly too much to ask? Now, in truth and my current truth, we stand between the unnecessary and freaking stupid teenage society, bringing up the dumbness from our other (adult) culture. Considering everything, the CGI itself was pretty poor. Not the worse ever (cough, cough, Shark-****ing-nado), but still pretty poor. And the creatures themselves don't really get enough screen-time, well, except the giant praying mantis.\r Another thing: the love story was worse than Twilight! Well, I mean, that's up for debate. Anybody wanna debate... I thought not. Anyway, you could see it coming from a mile away, about where they first mat. It's really cheesy, and just plain lazy story tale writing. With such great title recently, including decent love stories, this was a true shame and tragedy. And speak of tragedy, that \"un\"consensual kiss between the girl and the douchebag. So it's okay if a girl surprise kisses a dude, but not the other way around?!  That's just the gateway to reverse rape! It's pretty poor morality, especially coming from a movie advertised generally by kids. It was expected, but she should've at least leaned in to show she was gonna snog him. I mean, you could obviously tell she looked like a spoiled, lousy tart! But even so, she should've have done that without giving another hint or saying first. Geez, what a dynamite whore! Terrible message. No woman on man mouth rape, thank you very much. If I were him, I'd hit that **** (Not really) But still.\r Anyway, regardless of this, the movie still had some good. For example: it made you laugh unintentionally. But I'm not counting that, okay? So, what's the catch, eh? Welp. It's the principle, actually. It's a stupid teenage flick that only serves as pop culture, rather than real scars or enchantment. I was so confused with the emotions, honestly.\r At the time: it was a beautiful day. There were children excited, seats all ready, as I walked into the theater. I lied back, and began watching this torture. With movies like these, directors who strive... SHOULD BE ****ING A DUCK,,,\r My final verdict for this poorly advertised flick of ****ery, made by morons, for other morons who disrespect the books and bring overall shame to our modern society. This film... gets a ****ing ZERO out of ten. Class dismissed - sincerely, a pissed off 8 year old."

Admittedly that's made possible by doubling down on the comedy and not really delivering any horror, but what can I expect from a movie aimed at all ages?

Originally it was not meant to be like that, because it was adapted from a series of children's book of the same name into a single movie. All the characters from the different books (book series) brought into one place, thus 'Jumanji' effect.\r When the fictional book characters come into the life, a group of youngsters team up to save the town from invasion. A tale that takes place in one day, especially most of the narration was a one night adventure. Totally an unexpected movie, but still not a masterpiece than just entertaining product. Maybe the actors were the reason, especially inclusion of Jack Black was the turn out. His second collaboration with the director after 'Gulliver's Travels'. And not to forget the CGI work was very acceptable for a little production like this.\r This theme was a very old, but the characters were unique. Maybe it was a box office lucky, but people won't simply acknowledge for useless things. This film's success was the effort of hard work. I won't surprise if they decide to make a sequel.

Specially, as all the characters are so likable, even Champ who is this kind of dumb characters that are often turn out to be very annoying in many other movies like this. Honestly, sometimes Champ went too far, and some of his jokes fall flat, but that didn't make this character annoying, not in the slightest! I can't believe how many times I laughed out loud! Almost every single joke hits the mark. This movie also is as heartwarming as it is funny. Also, it has some very clever twists and turns that surprised me.Jack Black is so funny, even more funnier than he was in Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, IMO.Dylan Minnette is very good and adorable as always, but if you really want to see him acting, watch Don't Breathe or Netflix's series 13 Reasons Why. Odya Rush also is good, and Jillian Bell is hilarious as aunt Lorraine.Unfortunately, although I was engaged and very entrained in very second in this movie, I didn't really care, or rather worry about the characters. I didn't feel they were in danger. So this movie absolutely doesn't work as a thriller. As a PG-rated horror movie, this movie, of course, doesn't have to scare me. But the problem is that it becomes a bit tedious and lukewarm almost every time it tries to be scary. The visual effects could have been better, but it really don't have to be. Actually, I prefer to see the CGI in this quality, because it fits the campiness and the charming silliness of the movie, just like the original Jumanji. I can't believe how much I liked Goosebumps. I kept putting off watching it, and I thoroughly regret. I can't wait to watch the sequel!(7.5/10)"

      "text": "Without exaggeration, Goosebumps is one of the best comedy movies I've seen in a while. The humor works almost perfectly. Specially, as all the characters are so likable, even Champ who is this kind of dumb characters that are often turn out to be very annoying in many other movies like this. Honestly, sometimes Champ went too far, and some of his jokes fall flat, but that didn't make this character annoying, not in the slightest! I can't believe how many times I laughed out loud! Almost every single joke hits the mark.This movie also is as heartwarming as it is funny.

      "text": "this movie is just ehhhhh...... it has good monsters barely any screen time for them and a cliche about main character gets the girl and when the girl comes back after death it was clearly expected its just normal high school setting mc meats a girl something happens becomes bad, bad thing becomes worse something happens to a character leaving the high school mc to stop the bad thing and then gets the girl and then they live happily ever after but this movie dose leave room for a sequel which there was ehhhh. decent but not deserving of a 5    6/10"
