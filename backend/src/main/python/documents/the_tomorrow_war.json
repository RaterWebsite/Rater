It's adapt or die. Anyone who studied war history or knows at least the basics knows this.I'm not even military, yet I'm cringing how completely inept at suspending disbelief this script is.At least other future alien wars movies had evolved their weapons to fight aliens and had at least half-useful training grounds.

It isn\u2019t bad at all and it\u2019s a turn your brain off kind of movie but it still isn\u2019t great. Chris Pratt is good. He brings a fun and engaging set of charisma to his roles and he is no different here. His character is very one note though. His only motivation is that he cares about his daughter which isn\u2019t a bad motivation but the film is begging for more character development so that the emotional moments feel more impactful. Sam Richardson was fun but he really doesn\u2019t do a lot during the movie besides adding some comic relief to it. All of the other characters are very forgettable although I did enjoy J. K. Simmons presence even if he had basically nothing to do. Since this is a time travel movie, the logic is out of the window. There were several moments involving the creatures or characters that made me think, \u201cHold on. That\u2019s a big paradox\u201d. One moment involves Chris Pratt\u2019s character and the general from 50 years in the future. He wants to bring her back to the future with him but he cares so much about doing it that he almost dies at one point which would have screwed over the people in the past. And even if he succeeded in bringing her back, that would have created a massive paradox with two of the same character not to mention that she would just disappear since the future wouldn\u2019t happen. Like I said, the more you think about it, the worse the story gets. The action is fine. It isn\u2019t super impressive but it\u2019s not bad. It\u2019s serviceable for the story and it has its moments. The visual effects, aside from a few shots, are really impressive actually. The creature design looks terrifying and the visual effect artists do a great job making them look real. If anything, you should check this movie out for that. If you want a fun Chris Pratt movie then I would recommend checking this out but don\u2019t expect a masterpiece."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "So refreshing to see a good old action sci fi that is well done and has plenty of heart.

The story have been told many times, except they put some time travel in it. The level of stupidity of the main character is quite daunting. For a scientific person , he is totally unaware of time travel paradoxes. His relation and decisions to a future family member, feels totally out of places and lacks any kinds of logic. If the humour is good, the lines they say are really weak at times. The time travel aspect is full of holes. At least the movie have good actors in it. The performance of Pratt felt somewhat, robotic at times. The FX are really AAA. Nothing bad to say about the CGI. The Aliens are very convincing. The music is pretty good.

What makes it worse is that it has all the ingredients (A-list actor..top notch SPFX..obviously a BIG budget) to make it GREAT but is lacking the EASIEST and CHEAPEST BUT MOST IMPORTANT element of any movie: GOOD WRITING/STORYLINE/PLOT!WHATEVER you wanna call it this movie has virtually NONE of it.  I usually give sci-fi/fantasy and big pass when it comes to \"checking your mind at the door\" and the concept of \"suspension of disbelief\".  INDEPENDENCE DAY comes to mind in that it never took itself too seriously (Randy Quaid played as \"Cousin Eddie got abducted\" helped a lot in that regard..Genius! BTW) so I could give a lot of latitude to it (hacking into an alien computer to download a virus? what? where they using Windows98 or something?)This? Tomorrow War..Jeez what a trainwreck! All I can say is thank god I can cancel my Amazon account in 30 days..so I basically got to see this for free..but what a disappointment.  Much like Wonder Woman 1984 was used to get people to sign up for HBOMax..this is the same hustle.  That was a bad film..and so is this..If Hollywood stars are considered BANKABLE cuz they've done so many entertaining movies (I'm thinking of Harrison Ford or Eddie Murphy back in the 80s and 90s) that audiences basically say Oh, Chris Pratt is in this movie..he was in Guardians and Avengers and Jurassic Park..I bet this has to be good.I consider this a BLACK MARK against you StarLord (you're better than this)"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "I'm giving the film a 9 instead of an 8 because it for not being a reboot/sequel or poor adaptation of someone else work. It barrows from a lot of other science fiction properties like parts of Warhammer 40K for the aliens and the final objective is reminiscent to the plot of the movie Reign of Fire while being much better executed. But that's more originality then you will get from most Hollywood movies. The movies biggest strength is the creatures and the surprising relationship Pratt has with a female military's officer once gets to the future. Those scenes together were really powerful. Really the only thing stopping the movie from being a 10 are some minor flaws and nitpicks."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Ignore the critics and watch for yourself, I really enjoyed it, the critics wouldn't know what movies an average person like you and me would like.

There are a few flaws but that's to be expected when messing with time travel.The whole concept of sending regular people to the future is explained simply in the people they're sending I.e those who wouldn't be alive at the time of the war. That's troops who otherwise wouldn't be helpful in the futureThe complaints about weaponry not being  technologically advanced is easily explained too. They say the teleporter is held together with chewing gum and chicken wire. That's because they don't have resources. With the whitespikes wiping out humanity so fast, all economy and technology would be unavailable (who wants to farm resources mid alien invasion) so they pooled their last resources to create the teleporter. The ideas of tanks and jets are also good, if you don't take into account that they were used (jets anyway) and seemingly sparingly, almost like they don't have the resources. Couple that with the accelerated breeding of the whitespikes, humanity is pretty outnumbered.The ending however is a brutal paradox that ruined the movie in my eyes. How can they go to the future to learn of the whitespikes and find the toxin to kill them, if that future never existed. No future, no toxin, no knowledge of whitespikes and that's the end right thereOther than that a rather enjoyable movie"}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Hands down one of the worst movies I've ever seen.

In fact no one question s anything, they all just march like lemmings to their death. It gets so much worse. It finally dawns on 2 people to do the painfully obvious thing of a pre-emptive strike in the present.They use a child's knowledge of volcanoes to locate the aliens in Russia, at which point they tell president Putin and his elite special forces what they know. So they are able to wipe out the creature's as the should have done in the 1st place. Nope. That would make sense.Instead the The thick heroes smuggle themselves into Russian airspace.

From the onset, the movie offers a promising narrative that by the 20-minute mark has caught fire and began a terminal free-fall towards the ground. I won't rehash what others have echoed as to the gaping plot-holes and the like; I will add though that Amazon missed an opportunity here. The director/producers it seems tried to meld together Frequency (2000) with the plotline of The Day After Tomorrow (2004) and a shade of Starship Troopers (1997) all the while detracting from what made those movies likable. If the plotholes had been somewhat addressed maybe...maybe the movie could have been better. It seems that the writers sat down and said how do we achieve every movie trope we can in one sitting.

Don't worry, you won't miss anything.The main problem I had with this movie is that it isn't consistent in how it treats its own world and that ruined the experience for me. If that is a deal breaker for you as well, don't touch this movie.I am fine with the logical problems time travel stories pose and I was expecting a shallow action flick, which is certainly what I got. At the very least, characters in a movie need to react in consistence with themselves and their world though, for us to believe their emotions. I felt like this was not the case at all.The enemies in this movie get initially presented as very powerful killers, almost impervious to small arms fire and therefore a single enemy poses a serious threat to an entire squad. Only moments later the number of enemies multiplies and while this should mean the end of the movie from a consistent POV, the rules just change. And not in a way that can be cognitively grasped. The threat level just changes, to make scenes work.This dynamic gets WAY WORSE during the rest of the movie, when suddenly single shots from small arms fire outright kill the same enemies (the problem wasn't the aiming). It makes no sense at all and the movie just pushes forward throwing in stuff that either contradicts things that happened before or just never gets explained.When you get to the end, a serious decision is made for how to tackle a mission that is so outright idiotic that you can only laugh, when the movie wants you to think that this is a well thought out decision that demands a lot of the protagonists.
