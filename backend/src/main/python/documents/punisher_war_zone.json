This is just cinematic chewing gum, quite enjoyable while its on but has no lasting impressions what-so-ever. I can only recommend this to die hard Punisher fans."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "First, off...its better than the first attempt...but not by much. The first Punisher film (IMO) was horribly miscast and was totally lacking in substance and character...this version of the Punisher stays true to the brutality and \"no nonsense\" of the Punisher character himself...but its thrown in with some of the most over the top, gratuitous \"action\" ive ever seen in a movie...it will probably tickle your funny-bone more than it will raise your pulse. One thing they nailed was the casting of the Punisher...Ray Stevenson walks the walk and talks the talk...and has the \"look\" down to a T and unlike the first film, this movie has a Punisher that truly has NO problems dispatching the guilty without remorse (as the Punisher character should)...but the weak story tarnishes this. There is a story...its just not in the least bit interesting, which is fine, because i dont think this film was going for anything \"thought worthy\"...but more \"balls to the wall\". Dominic West plays a decent enough villain...and he plays the character well, seemingly having a good time being a slimy, tough talking mob boss...obsessed with his looks (his accent during some of the dialog gave me a HUGE chuckle). If you are looking for something action packed, story-less, and hammy then this will be your \"cotton candy\" for an evening...cant recommend as a buy however. Overall...its worth a look...if anything, just to watch something loud and dumb which is nice from time to time...but to also see a potentially cool Punisher character...and afterwards, you can wonder what wouldve have happened had they gotten it right...oh well.

Yes. Ridiculous? Yes. A showing of the REAL punisher in action? YES!\r Here's the thing. The first punisher sucked okay kids. It wasn't anything like the comic book character. In that movie he goes around like a assassin messing with the minds of his enemies and taking them out from the inside. This isn't James Bond dudes.... It's the punisher. The punisher just shows up and guns you down. That's who he is in the comics and this movie gets it right.\r Here's the thing that's annoying and stupid though. Punisher 1 is liked even though it's not like the comics. Punisher 2 aka warzone is hated for following the comics...\r Dead pool in wolverine didn't follow the comics and everyone hated it. Deadpool in his own movie followed the comics and everyone loves it.\r WHAT????\r This is proof that most people are dumb.\r Anyways the movie isn't perfect but it does a good job with the character.

This potential is largely wasted with Punisher: War Zone thanks to a woefully underwhelming script, a pedestrian and cliched plot and a general lack of passion. Ray Stevenson can do so much better than this (the excellent TV series Rome for instance) but is limited to glowering and reducing goons to pulp. Even if he's brutally killing evil thugs, Frank Castle needs to be somewhat relatable to be a compelling protagonist, and it takes more than pulling a sad face whenever the film flashes back to the tragic deaths of his family. The rest of the cast are a mix of the good and the bad. Dominic West's performance as scarred mob boss Jigsaw is hammy, and often comes across as a really bad Robert De Niro impression, and Colin Salmon plays the same character he plays in every film, another cool authority figure. At least Wayne Knight's backstreet armourer and Dash Mihok's sympathetic bumbling cop provide the film with some much-needed comic relief, and Stephanie Janusauskas acts everyone else off the screen as a little girl who is brought into Frank Castle's life because of a tragic accident. The film does have a pleasingly over-the-top and bloody final set piece where The Punisher shoots, explodes and stabs his way through a hotel full of heavily-armed gangsters and mercenaries. It really takes something for a film to attempt to be this dark and broody, and to come across as camp, but this film somehow manages it at an alarmingly frequent rate, and the big over-arching theme of the film, the failures of the American Justice system has been handled much better in nearly every other film that has tried to tackle it, even Law Abiding citizen, which wasn't a good movie. Punisher: War Zone is a missed opportunity in short. It's not awful thanks to a few laughs, a few thrills, and young Stephanie Janusauskas, but it's pretty bad."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This is my favorite of the 3 Punisher movies although I thoroughly enjoyed the one starring Dolph Lundgren.

The action and violence may turn some off, but I was enjoying myself as The Punisher was blowing people to bits and destroying faces with the might of his fist."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "It went from the solid previous film that had good drama and interest to a pointless action packed film that was far too unrealistic. While Ray Stevenson is a good lead and a good choice for the punisher, The rest of the cast sucked."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "For a film that is claiming to represent a 'war zone', its scenes are far too stilted, calculated, and formulaic. Stevenson unengagingly mopes around depressed for the time he isn't killing people, which makes for incredibly boring dialogue. Though, when the story is this cheesy and cliched it doesn't matter how it is delivered. That being said, the acting (particularly from Dominic West) is so campy that it contradicts the movie's attempt at a gritty noir-esque atmosphere. The one saviour for War Zone is its unapologetic ultraviolence, which is just too silly to be considered disgusting, and keeps the film from becoming too tiresome. Give this a pass unless you are particularly fond of the source material."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "War Zone is like a bomb going off in your TV.  Its a nerve-jangling cacophony of noise and flashing lights and splattering DNA that doesn't bother with anything resembling story.  But strangely, I couldn't help feeling slightly more entertained than I did with the Thomas Jane outing."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Is it seriously that hard to make a decent Punisher movie? Really? The Marvel Comics anti-hero is pretty much simplicity itself: After watching the gangland murder of his family, Frank Castle goes nuts, dons a T-shirt with a skull on it, and kills every bad guy in sight. Figure out a way to throw in some decent action scenes, temper it with some hand-wringing about the cost of revenge, find the right unsmiling face to play the guy with the guns, add explosions. Bang. There's your movie. And yet Punisher: War Zone is the third attempt to bring the Punisher to the big screen\u2014it follows two different movies called The Punisher, 1989's low-budget Dolph Lundgren effort, and a bigger-deal 2004 movie starring Thomas Jane and John Travolta. Neither of those films made good on the seemingly simple task of translating one of the comic-book world's simplest characters.\r Punisher: War Zone at least trades up in Punishers. Rome's Ray Stevenson has the right mix of imposing bulk and sensitivity to look simultaneously hurt and pissed while blowing the brains out of bad guys. He's joined by another slumming former HBO star, The Wire's Dominic West, who spends most of the film sporting cut-rate deformo makeup as the bad guy.\r Their presence doesn't suggest the class of this movie so much as the difficulty that cable actors have finding decent roles when their shows end; this is junk, a bunch of hard-R action scenes kept together by the thinnest of plots. Which would be fine if it were entertaining junk, but the parade of dimly lit skull explosions grows old quickly, and director Lexi Alexander (Green Street Hooligans) brings neither energy nor gravity to the over-the-top violence, which would feel excessive if the film knew the meaning of the word excess. It's a joyless plunge into gunfire that doesn't even know how to draw blood."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "It's The Punishe! It's supposed to be action packed, gore filled and dripping with bad assery.

Any fan of Frank Castle who's even looked at a comic book knows that the last two movies were something awful. War Zone takes it in the right direction, and Ray Stevenson does a much better job of portraying Castle than does Jane - heck this movie even has a halfway accurate back story which already puts it over Jane's Punisher any day. The action is intense and gritty, just like you'd be reading one of the comic books. The acting isn't the greatest thing in the world, but anybody who's going to watch this movie and enjoy it isn't there for the acting - or even the gore - you're watching it to see Frank Castle kick the crap out of some scum, and War Zone finally lets him do it."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This movie isn't getting enough credit. A comic book movie should be rated on two things, how entertaining was it, and how well did it meet the feel of the comic book. This movie was very entertaining and was just like the comic.

Yet for the hardcore fan of comics and the Punisher you will surely be pleased. Not to give away the plot, but imagine a Punisher movie where his family dies accurately? Or he walks and talks and shoots like ex-special forces rather then a super hero. If you suffered through the first two Punisher installments, then this one will make up everything those took away. Highly recommended!"}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Grandmas die. In popular culture, usually from natural causes, but sometimes they get run over by reindeer. During its time, that Christmas novelty song, a Dr. Demento favorite, was considered to be in questionable taste. Babies and old ladies, for the most part, are spared the spectacle of a grisly murder. But earlier this year, all bets were off, when a Nazi soldier shish-kabobed a crying baby in Spike Lee's \"Miracle at St. Anna's\", an aspect of German savagery that Steven Spielberg, and most filmmakers, wouldn't touch. Sure, the right people die in \"Punisher: War Zone\", gangsters and their ilk, as Frank Castle(Ray Stevenson) embodies every gamer who points and shoots at anything that moves. He flatters the gamer by rarely missing, while remaining impervious to the falling bodies. They're points, not people. \"Punisher: War Zone\" is yet another in a long line of movies that resemble video games. And just like a video game, a shooter game such as \"Grand Theft Auto\", for instance, there's going to be collateral damage. In an actual film, the audience, at least, goes through the motions of mourning the innocent victim. Not here, though. Not this new breed of video game-inspired quasi-films. While both video game and movie share the same objective of fighting for justice to prevail, the head of an old woman, bloodied and almost completely eviscerated, supplies the gamer with the cheap thrills he experiences when innocent people catch a bullet. In a film such as \"Punisher: War Zone\", a dead grandma is the gamer's idea of black comedy. It's supposed to be funny."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Just awesome!

Go watch this movie - not to see amazing writing or oscar-worthy acting, but for a sadistic and entertaining experience!"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "First off, the critics have been a bit harsh when reviewing this film. I respect Roger Ebert and I generally sift through the reviews here to see what he has to say about most movies that I watch. His is a fair review. As far as film quality, this is no Godfather. Then again it's not supposed to be. War Zone is the Punisher pulled from the adult targeted comics and projected on screen. The gore and violence is over the top, but then again Frank Castle is an over the top vigilante. I loathed the Dolph Lundgren Punisher. There was very little about that film that resembled the Punisher that fans know and love. The Thomas Jane Punisher wasn't as bad as many will argue, but I am sympathetic to the fact that his Punisher was poorly scripted and spent way too much time on a muddled and wrong backstory. As much as Thomas Jane loved the character, he couldn't save that movie from the rightful criticism that they took the worst corny elements from the Max line and used them for the story. However, this time the Punisher has been done right. They took some of the best elements of the comics and brought them to life on screen and it's going to be a pleasing spectacle for all fans of the Punisher comic line. Also of note, they ignored the fact that the last two films existed and thereby relaunched with the proper origin story unlike the Jane film. As a huge Punisher fan, I am glad they finally cast someone who looks the part, plays the part well, and more importantly filmed a script that does justice to the character. I can only hope the film is successful enough to warrant a sequel."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This movie rocks, idk why its getting such a bad rap.

Ray Stevenson( who I thought was a better Punisher than Thomas Jane.) stars as the titled character who continues his four year fight against organized crime. And has to confront his greatest foe. Jigsaw, Jigsaw was a underboss named Bill Ruso( they slightly changed it for the movie Rousoti.) who was nearly killed by the Punisher, and now wants his revenge for horribly disfiguring him and will stop at nothing to kill him.

I was a bit worried that I would be let down after reading some of the early reviews, my suspicious about the reviewers not understanding the character were confirmed though. Stevenson is a brilliant Frank Castle, the guy is a tank in this movie, shredding through his opposition just like a on screen manifestation of the character should. The critics complaining about the gore prove them unfit in being tasked with stepping anywhere near the film with a pencil and paper, doling out stars or thumbs. While Im afraid the film will not get the critical recognition it deservers, with the majority of critics not understanding the character, I as a fan of Castle say I'm thoroughly pleased by the work the entire cast and crew have put forth. While I agree that the movie was loyal to the source material and worth my dollars, there was one main area I think should have been retooled. Jigsaw and Jim's accent is over the top, and in the end took away from the character, especially in the case of Jim.

The punisher was never especially deep, he wasnt even brooding or sad or depressed, or really emotional in any sense. Thomas Jane's punisher attempted to make him more human, tried to add a believable element to Frank Castle. We all know how that went. The punisher is more a force of nature than a man and this movie did not attempt anything other than emphasize that perfectly. The punisher cannot be stopped because quite simply he WONT be stopped. he wont give in and he doesnt fear his own death. one of the best descriptions of this movie was \"a slasher flick with guns\" and the Punisher is the new Jason. never in the film do we see him at a point where he is in anyway struggling against his foes. he rips through them like they were nothing. nuff said. I completely understand that many people will think this movie is awful, however to see a comic book movie done with such a passion for the fan base ( every single character in this film has been plucked from different points in the comic) Its not the perfect film by any means. but as far as a film based on the punisher? hell yeah it is. this movie is everything the punisher is supposed to be, and if you like the punisher, you'll love this movie too."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "There is really not much I can say that has not been said already on this list of audience reviews.

The casting of Ray Stevenson is well deserved and should have been done in the 2004 film. Tom Jane is a great actor but the look of the Punisher character is already established and he did not look the part. This film is very true to the comic and is ultra violent. This character is well past the point of redemption and Ray Stevenson brings appropriate weight to his scenes of regret during the movie.
