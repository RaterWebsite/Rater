      "text": "Though sadly overshadowed by the overrated dynamic duo of Wall-e and Kung Fu Panda, this warm, familiar animated movie with stunning visuals and beautiful, hand-painted backgrounds doesn't only mark a successful return for Disney on the animated area, but manages to introduce characters and themes that are in many ways more deep and complex than that of the widely glorified Pixar flicks. Take Bolt for example, the loveable and stunningly adorable main character who, in less than 90 minutes, shows a wide spectrum of emotions and behavior, ranging from self-realization, denial and identity crisis. Aside from this amazing character development, he also embodies the loyal and trusting nature of a dog. The only problem with this movie is that this main character, with a story with so much potential for depth, was pushed to the background to make room for the annoying comic relief hamster and the funny-talking pigeons, making a movie that could have been absolutely splendid merely a great one. Still though, the scenes in which the furry main character, Bolt himself, is allowed to shine are the by far most touching. Particularly the puppy scene in the beginning and his unselfish bravery in the end, thus making this movie a most see for any self-acclaimed dog lover and anyone who wants to see a good animated film. And the way this character shows a contrast by his aggressive, delusional super-hero persona, and his sweet-natured, natural and loveable doggy-side, which is mostly seen when he is together with his owner Penny - the little girl to whom he directs all his considerable love and devotion - should make him an inspiring figure for children and adults alike."

It's funny for all, with a fat hamster named Rhino who is obsessed with Bolt stealing the show alongside 3 sets of three pigeons who appear throughout the show. Some of the story is very predictable, particularly the relationship between Bolt and Mittens, but it's still very enjoyable and funny."

While some people think it rips-off Toy Story, Bolt reminds me more of Homeward Bound than anything else - another \"Doggy Come Home\" story. The movie does have its strong points, though. As I said, the animation is awesome (it is Disney, after all). Rhino and Mittens were the most interesting characters in my opinion, but Bolt was pretty charming himself. Bolt had some emotional moments too, particularly near the end of the film. But even with the movie's strengths, I didn't think it was very memorable. It wasn't a steaming pile of crap like The Wild, but it was just okay.On a lighter note, if you have kids, I'm sure they'll love it. But if you're a teenager or adult who's not into that Miley Cyrus/Disney Channel junk, don't waste your time with Bolt, watch WALL-E instead."

      "text": "Why all the deception? Why not use an animal trainer? In this world, televsion producers don't believe in dogs doing method. So they pull a \"Truman Show\" on him. For the show to work, Bolt(John Travolta) is tricked repeatedly into thinking that Penny(Miley Cyrus) needs saving. The dog never leaves the studio. Since Bolt looks older than his previous incarnation as a puppy in the opening scene, there's the suggestion that Penny and Bolt bonded at the studio facilities before the show went into production. But what did Penny teach him? Apparently, very little; a cat teaches Bolt how to be a dog. Before he meets Mitttens(Susie Essman), the \"superpowers\" Bolt possesses can be characterized as the abilities of an idiot savant, because this is one maladjusted dog. Shooting laser beams out of his eyes comes more naturally to him than sniffing another dog's butt. During his puppy stage, Penny seems to have played a big part in making an emotional cripple out of Bolt. Before her feelings for him blossomed into something genuine, their relationship was based on a premise of fakery. At some point, Penny permitted herself to love the dog. The photographs she hangs up in their dressing room is a timeline, and somewhere on that timeline, Bolt stopped being more than her co-star. The photographs are a smart allusion to the \"relationship\" between Jim Carrey and Laura Linney, in which photographic evidence is collected as proof of a bonafide relationship. The cracks in Penny's conscience begin to show, well before Bolt disappears, but full-blown remorse towards her complicitness over subordinating the dog's welfare for the good of the show and her burgeoning career, surfaces when she has to act with a replacement. Mittens is half-right when she points to Penny's image on a billboard, as the cat makes her case for the duplicity of human beings. Penny comes around, but not before she commits animal cruelty."

      "text": "I'm 23 years old, but I suppose I expect a lot from Disney. But I should be able to; I think the real test of a Disney movie is not whether it can entertain children but whether it can entertain the whole family. If I feel stupid while watching a Disney movie, that move fails as a Disney movie, as while directed at children, they're supposed to be family films. This move succeeds. Its very well done, and Bolt and Mittens (John Travolta and some actress?) do a great job, as does the actress who voice acts the girl, Penny. Rhino the Hampster was not the best cast member; I suppose they needed comedic relief, but he was fairly extraneous to the plot beyond letting Mittens understand what was going on and why Bolt was acting so crazy. Overall, the movie was quite enjoyable, and is the best Disney film since Mulan. While not of their early 90s level, its still quite a solid movie, and I shall get it on DVD as I enjoyed watching it. Some scenes of it even made me feel sad, which means the folks at Disney did their job well. If you're going to the theatres this winter, this is a much better choice than movies like Quantum of Solace or Twilight."

      "text": "While it's not perfect by any means, Bolt is the film that shows Disney finally returning to form after nearly a decade of sub-par films. The easiest way to look at Bolt is like an animated version of The Truman Show that becomes a road movie about halfway through. It works as a film on both accounts, having some clever things to say about network television and providing you with some nice juicy morals, and giving you some pretty animated scenery to oggle at on the way. The voice cast are all good - playing the title role,Travolta gives his best performance since The Thin Red Line, and Susie Essman's streetwise feline mittens and especially Mark Walton's psychotic hamster super-fan Rhino are constantly entertaining. It's also a stroke of genius casting Miley Cyrus as child star and Bolt's owner Penny. The animation is stunning across the board, but what particularly impresses is that the animators have struck the perfect balance between realistically recreating animal movement and mannerisms, and anthropomorphising the characters for empathy purposes. Bolt is a perfectly enjoyable, often clever and funny animation that only just lacks the creativity, universal appeal and heart of Pixar's best efforts. Pixar, for now at least, still holds the torch of exceptional animation high, but Disney is closing in fast - thank goodness, it's been a while."

The only week points are in the beginning Bolt is shipped in a box from LA to New York with no real issues. Who would have thought you could mail a dog in a box of packing peanuts. The other problem is Miley Cyrus. She is very poorly cast in the part of Penny, Bolt's owner. Her voice does not match the age of the character and she is not a very good voice actress. Outside of these two issues the movie is absolutely great with a good story and good execution. A great movie for adults and kids."

The story follows Bolt, a dog who works on a television show with his owner and thinks he has superpowers because the producers maintain the illusion. When he is accidentally shipped to New York, he has to find his way home as he deals with the fact his powers are gone. It's a stupid premise and it never really works. It has some cute moments and the character of Rhino is a great one but it never gets off the ground thanks to the premise. When Bolt reaches New York the film treads water for 20 minutes and it becomes a poor version of Homeward Bound for the latter. John Travolta has fun as Bolt but Miley Cyrus is irritating as Bolt's owner Penny. The ending is the best part of the film but it still seems incredibly forced and insincere. It's just a film that suffers from a poor premise and never really recovers."

Not only that, but the subtle adage of \u2018you can\u2019t hold onto things forever\u2019 adds a nice touch of emotion to the plot, although a small touch.\r I felt the film dealt strongly with relationships; how characters develop between one another as they take that migration, and while a substantial amount of films will have a disagreement between two of these characters, Bolt was no exception  this being the only point I felt was lacking: the disagreement that appeared within the film was too basic, and my personal score would have risen a few more points if they had taken that disagreement outside of the box.\r But overall, Disney still does not disappoint in delivering a warm family film which is very reinvigorating to watch every once in a while."
