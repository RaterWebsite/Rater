This was written like it should have been a short TV series. 3 episodes at best.The acting was OVERKILL! Seriously women? You are all better actors than what you portrayed!The so-called special effects were beyond terrible. The water bomb timing was way off. Doesn't anyone watch and edit movies anymore?This was an insult to the original Black Panther actor. (Sorry I can't remember his name off the top of my head.) He should have been replaced. If they didn't want to replace him - they could and should have - given him a warrior's death! Why show how he died in real life? (Cancer I believe.)I'm proudly married - they didn't agree with that!I am a proud mother of sons - they don't agree with that!I respect ALL - they sure as HELL do not!Women and men are equal - not in this movie!Are my expectations too high because I bought and read the comics?

The acting was excellent and emotional during some moments. All in all, I think this is what Chadwick Boseman's memory deserved."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "A very good movie.  I loved it.  Was a touch bored at times, but always invested.  Extreme difficulty project that they landed beautifully.  Better than the first one in my opinion, but I\u2019m sure opinions will vary on that.  This was very well directed.  Coogler and the camera team imbued this film with a lot of artistry.  As huge studio pictures go this movie was a visual marvel.  The 3D was worth it too.  It didn\u2019t feel like \u201cjust another marvel movie\u201d and that\u2019s the most important compliment at this point.  Black Panther as a series has its own vibe more than the others and I appreciate that at this point in the marvel anthology.  Acting was all very good.  There\u2019s a lot of heavy lifting to be done here and everyone showed up.  Music is a little in your face at times but it worked.  Everything felt of a tone.The plot here is better than the actual nuts and bolts of the story but I like the characters and the worlds they played with.  It\u2019s a visceral experience with compelling emotionality.  I also enjoyed the folklore elements that were woven into the tale.On its own terms, I\u2019d give it an 8.5/10.  Out of all marvel movies I\u2019d rank it as B+ tier."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "This was a below average Marvel movie at best. They should have either recast T'Challa or made a Boseman tribute movie on Disney+ and got all the crying and reminiscing out of the way before proceeding with Wakanda Forever because this movie had pacing problems. Some of the action scenes were good, but the movie in whole was mostly just slow and boring. My favorite character was General Okoye. Ironheart was disappointing and Riri was simply forgettable and the suits were terrible, let's be honest. I don't know how Marvel managed to do it, but Namor was both interesting and disappointing at the same time. The first Black Panther, although overhyped and overrated as it was imo, I thought it was an above average Marvel movie personally, was simply a better movie than WF.

Namor in general needed more time to discover his character.  Angela Bassett should get some kind of award she really is the Queen Ramonda and am only reminded its her because there is only 1 Angela Bassett on this planet.

Where this movie falls short is much more disappointing.To start, the stakes are incredibly low. It\u2019s hard to become invested in a story and the idea of Namor as a villain when there are no consequences whatsoever. Everyone knew Wakanda wasn\u2019t going to fall, or that no notable characters were going to die, or suffer any tragedy that could be used as character development. This saps the life out of the movie, and makes it seem pointless.My second gripe is Namor himself. The writing really fails to cement him as a true villain. Somewhere in the underwater scene his motivations suddenly shift from \u201cI just want to protect my people\u201d, to \u201cI want to watch the world burn\u201d, with no real catalyst. This relegates IronHeart\u2019s purpose in the movie to another half-baked character in a suit of armor with no real purpose. This also makes Namor\u2019s subtle amicability seem laughable. You want to watch the whole world burn, but you\u2019ll half heartedly kill the queen, and be so cordial as to give the resourceful Wakandans a week to reconsider, and then throw your motivations in the trash simply by getting bested in combat? Seems like his heart was never in it to begin with. The third area this movie falls short in is the combat. The choreography here is desperately lacking, and the constant camera cuts are dizzying, and seemingly wants viewers to fill in the gaps on what\u2019s happening between cuts. The side boss given to Okoye is insipid and unimposing as well. Marvel seems to be heavily regressing in the action department instead of upping the ante . It doesn\u2019t even surpass the original Black Panther, nor does it even crack the top 10 in terms of action. Other gripes:- cliche \u201crevenge isn\u2019t the answer,\u201d storyline straight from The Last of Us Part 2.-Power scaling is all over the place and further diminishes The Hulk. Ok, Namor is as strong as The Hulk, but buddy from the mountains took a punch from him and was better within a day.-Shuri\u2019s urge for vengeance leads to an incompetent plan that only an Imbecile and not the sharp kind of a genius would concoct-How did Shuri have a Black Panther suit perfectly tailor-made for herself when she was dubious of the ancestral plane even existing and was reluctant to takeover the mantle from the start"}, {"rating": "4", "text": "This movie is made very well but it\u2019s too somber. The only technical flaws are the poor lighting in the first third of the film similar to how Solo: A Star Wars Story is. The acting is done well. The cinematography is spot on for the most part. The characters are just as good as part one. The story is bad. The logic is bad. And the Black Panther had very little screen time and does not do enough to feel heroic. I also don\u2019t really like how the Black Panther became the Black Panther. It seemed like an after thought. The credits scene is the best scene in the movie and is very touching. This is by far the worst marvel movie. I\u2019m still glad i watched it. I\u2019m still glad it exists. I probably won\u2019t watch it again. I\u2019ve loved nearly everything Marvel has released.
