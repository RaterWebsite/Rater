It's a slightly different take on the series, but this fourth installment is not NEARLY as scary as the first two.  The third was just bizarre - especially the ending.  There's a shot at the very end of this film that's disturbing, but still not all that scary. I just felt there were so many opportunities for scares using the new filming conventions that they didn't exploit (video chat, the Kinect sensor, etc). And the car / carbon monoxide sequence was WAY too much like a hundred other horror films, which depressed me a bit. So yes, it was a pedestrian effort, but I did have fun with the opening night crowd which was properly amped up, so I'll stick with the four.  The true test of how much of an affect a horror movie has had on me is whether I\"m freaked out walking up the dark staircase in my place afterwards . In this case?  Not freaked out at all. Bum deal."

      "text": "\"Paranormal Activity 4\" is easily the weakest yet in the series, lacking much of the innovation and fresh tactics of its predecessors and posing none of the answers it promises to deliver. This sequel was marketed to shed some light on the last movie's plot mess of a conclusion, but instead only gives us the same questions after 90 minutes of old hat sound effects, jump scares, and failed attempts at keeping the formula fresh. I'll give the film credit for its use of webcam surveillance, which although is likely not possible under these circumstances, does give us some new perspectives apart from the tired handheld video. But setpieces like a certain kitchen knife and the XBox Kinect are promising lodes of suspense cut short of their full potential, and the characters range from likeable (the main chick) to barely present and mostly moronic (the parents). It just feels more like the hollow shell of a \"Paranormal Activity\" movie, rather than what we've grown used to over the past films  so much so that, unless the next sequel proves otherwise, this franchise has likely proved itself to have already passed its prime."

As a fan of the series (perhaps ex-fan now), I was really looking forward to this film, hoping it would redeem itself, after the awful attempt 3 made of saving the series.  The cheap scares and long camera takes are evidently getting old, with more people switching off. In terms of plot, I was eager to see how the main plot line of the previous installment would continue, only to be disappointed with more questions than answers by the end of the movie. My only hope is that the franchise will end sooner rather than later, no doubt in the traditional way of cutting any chance of a plot in the movie short. Although scoring it a 4 is poetic justice, I do believe it is quite a generous score, given the material."

But after watching it at the cinema, I felt like I wasted my time and money. \"Paranormal Activity 4\" will leave you unsatisfied with an unresolved cliffhanger, very slow scenes, and lots of cheap scares. The acting was not good especially from Kathryn Newton and their reason for filming wasn't pretty convincing. Also, I'm disgusted that the series is starting to utilize CGI effects which ruins the movie's atmosphere. In a brighter scale, the methods for capturing the activity were smart just like its predecessors and there are \"some\" scenes that frightened me a little bit.\r Overall: This is definitely not the best one in the franchise.

This got me thinking I might actually like \u201cParanormal Activity 4,\u201d the latest in the long running \u201cstupid as hell shaky cam horror movie series that continually refuses to die because people are foolish enough to keep throwing their money at it\u2026.thing.\u201d If future me could give my past me three words of advice, they would be as follows: \u201cDon\u2019t kid yourself.\u201d\r The story is the same as every other freaking \u201cParanormal Activity\u201d movie and will likely be the same as every one that will ever come out till the sun implodes and kills us all in a fiery blast. A family is slowly tormented by, oh, I don\u2019t know, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY and then in the end people die and nothing significant get\u2019s resolved (spoilers I guess\u2026). The only new story item thrown into the mix are the two main characters, a teenage girl and her teenage boyfriend. This might sound gimmicky but this may be the best thing about the movie. Both characters are likable and coupled with both teenage actors giving good performances\u2026as\u2026teenagers works. I found myself actually caring about protagonists in this despicable little series for the first time in ever. Thus it was quite the disappointment to see the boyfriend just kinda stop showing up until near the end for seemingly no apparent reason and then have the focus fall on the mother and father who are completely boring.\r I\u2019m not even going to go into detail about the acting because besides the two leads none of the actors give a remotely interesting performance. So let\u2019s talk instead about the directing, it\u2019s very basic. That might sound like an insult but it\u2019s actually a roundabout compliment. Unlike every other movie in the series, I could tell what the hell was going on even if the onscreen action was pretty bland, and that sadly elevates it far and above many movies I\u2019ve seen in the last few years.\r Whether or not you find this movie scary will depend on whether you found any of the other \u201cParanormal Activity\u201d movies to be frightening. I say this because it does everything the others do. Seriously, did you expect anything else? I usually have nothing against sequels but when a studio pops out this many sequels this quickly, how can anyone expect something of quality? None of the previous three felt the need to change up the formula so why would this one?\r Aside from the two likable leads, the only other thing \u201cParanormal Activity 4\u201d does differently than it\u2019s predecessors is it\u2019s use of technology, which I did enjoy. They use their macs as a sort of spy camera to see what goes on at night and they do some cool stuff with a Kinect as well. But in the end, I realized it was all just a gimmick. It does little to distract you from its multitude of flaws.\r Breaking the movie down into the three-act structure, it only gets worse as time goes on. I\u2019ll admit, I surprisingly liked the first act. The two leads were characterized and likable, a few fake scares (some of which weren\u2019t half bad) but mostly just the calm before the storm. The second act was boring if only because the pacing was sluggish and felt mostly like filler. Then the third act, which was supposed to be the movie\u2019s saving grace, was a train wreck. The ending in particular has to be one of the worst endings I\u2019ve ever seen to a horror movie. Without spoiling it, it felt like everything was sloppily thrown together as if the film crew realized they only had till midnight to complete it.\r Every so often, I think I\u2019ve seen all the bad movies out there. As someone who writes scripts in their spare time, I can\u2019t help but marvel whenever I see a movie start off with potential and then completely screw up everything good about it shortly thereafter. At this point, I\u2019ve learned that the worst movies are those that give you hope and then smash your face in about an hour later. But I\u2019ve spent enough time talking about this abomination so I\u2019ll just conclude by saying that if you have hope for mankind, you will lose it after watching this movie.\r \u201cParanormal Activity 4\u201d gets a 2/10."
