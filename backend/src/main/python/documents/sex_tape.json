To kick things up a notch, they decide \u2013 why not? \u2013 to make a video of themselves trying out every position in The Joy of Sex in one marathon three-hour session.  It seems like a great idea \u2013 until they discover that their most private video is no longer private.  With their reputations on the line, they know they\u2019re just one click away from being laid bare to the world... but as their race to reclaim their video leads to a night they'll never forget, they'll find that their video will expose even more than they bargained for.",

      "text": "\"Sex Tape\" 10 Scale Rating: 1.5 (Awful) ...\r The Good: While it was a small role, Rob Lowe was actually funny. Rob Corddry was pretty entertaining as well.\r The Bad: While the premise is not a bad one and had the potential to be a hilarious film, \"Sex Tape\" squanders a great setup and wasn't even remotely funny.  In fact, I don't think I even chuckled or smirked once. Cameron Diaz was especially awful and ruins entire scenes all on her own. Jason Segel tried really hard to make this an entertaining film, but perhaps tries TOO hard as most of his jokes fall flat. A woefully inadequate attempt at a raunchy comedy."

Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel try far too hard in this film and a majority of the gags fall flat on their face. And at the film's halfway mark, it becomes surprisingly boring. A few mildly amusing one-liners as well as a random, pointless five-minute cameo from Jack Black couldn't even save this one. Easily the worst comedy I've seen all year."

      "text": "It had become very apparent to me early on during my viewing of \u201cSex Tape\u201d that Cameron Diaz, and Jason Siegel were going to have remarkable on screen chemistry. Then the unthinkable happened, the first five minutes ended. Where to begin? is a question that is never asked in the treacherous debacle that is \u201cSex Tape\u201d. A bland attempt at a lude-and raunchy R rated comedy, that is not only poorly scripted, but severely unfunny in all the wrong ways.\rThe film follows the early sex lives of one Jay (Siegel) and Annie (Diaz), we (the audience) know nothing about the couple at first. just that they love having sex. (As showcased within the films first hefty five minute montage - these scenes alone earned the hard R rating). Fast forward a few years -- and they have a couple kids, and are happily married. Annie is on the verge of the biggest breakthrough of her career (selling her blog to a huge branding company) headed by a douchey, crazy, and creepy Rob Lowe. While Jay is a successful songwriter, and musician. Between the jobs and the children sex is hardly ever an option. However, on a brink night to celebrate Annie\u2019s new job. In a last ditch effort to restore some flair and originality into their sex lives...the couple inadvertently make a three hour long escapade. Thinking all was free and clear, their sex tape accidently leaks into the cloud and becomes available to all their closest friends and family. This results in a wild goose chase to \u201cerase\u201d all the evidence before it\u2019s too late.\r \u201cSex Tape\u201d is by far one of the more intriguing premises this year has to offer. I mean ask yourself..\u201dif you made a sex tape?\u201d would you want your mom seeing it? heavens no. So my props go to Jake Kasdan and Jason Siegel for making a cool premise, That is, of course, the extent of my appreciation. From then on the movie wallows in self pity, and never takes off from the standard set. At one point Diaz character says \u201cthe quality of writing in porn has really gone down these days\u201d. I immediately thought to myself \u201cand so has this movie\u201d ..this was a whopping twenty minutes into the film, where I knew there was no going back.\r With most films that start off poorly you keep gesturing to your inner self \u201cit\u2019s going to get better, stick with it\u201d and besides from a fun cameo towards the end of the fIlm (I won\u2019t reveal who) \u201cSex Tape\u201d is just moronic and plain boring. Picture an hour and forty minute long trailer..except with no humor, no jokes, and not a sensible care in the world. The film co-stars Rob Lowe in his worst performance..to date. In comparison..when you look at earlier films this year \u201cBlended\u201d for example, was a film that knew its boundaries, and it didn\u2019t try to be better than it was. \u201cSex Tape\u201d think\u2019s it\u2019s funny, and keeps mustering up the same lame one-liners that just leave you sitting in your seat checking your watch constantly wondering where the film is going. I was not a big fan of Kasdan and companies last film \u201cBad Teacher\u201d I thought the bawdy humor didn\u2019t mesh well with the plot at hand. I suppose the same goes \u201cSex Tape\u201d in a sense. Not to mention this film has the most absurd amount of product placement I have ever seen. Ok..we get it..you like Apple products. Give me a break!.\r \u201cSex Tape\u201d is a film that comes on strong..and then surprisingly pushes you away. There are some moments where I laughed (preferably the aforementioned cameo). Sloppy characters, and even sloppier jokes (Even by R rated standards). Siegel belting out his lines in a high pitched squeal doesn\u2019t help either. I admire the passion and devotion our two leads have to this film. (Diaz especially) However, as with most films with a intricate premise. \u201cSex Tape\u201d is the latest addition to take something cool, and make it dull and lifeless.\r D-\r By: Nate Adams\r Directed By: Jake Kasdan\r Rated: R\rRuntime: 100 mins\rStudio: Sony\rRelease Date: July 18th 2014\r Thanks For Stopping By \u00ae"

      "text": "Cameron Diaz & Jason Segel play a married couple who decide to spice up their sex life by recording it. Needless to say, it gets out of their hands, which is supposed to cause a zany time. As a screen couple, Diaz provides the hot and Segel handles the comedy. Unfortunately, the majority of the movie is spent with them in mediocre banter and their chemistry isn't special. The attempts at madcap situations are overblown and silly. Despite the efforts at outrageous humor and enuff F-bombs to make Tarantino blush, most of the gags fall flaccid (pun intended). The upbeat energy keeps it moving, but the genuine laffs are overclouded by everyone trying too hard (pun also intended)."

      "text": "Probably the laziest comedy I have ever seen. It seems like as little effort as possible went into making it. As if the only reason it exists is out of some contractual obligation. There are a lot of great, funny people here who give it no effort. The jokes are so bland and unoriginal that it's evident writer Kate Angelo just took bits and pieces of unfunny jokes from other comedies and through them in with original gags that lack humor in every way.\r Once or twice a chuckle worthy line popped up and a cameo from Jack Black spitting out the names of porn sites mildly amused, but nothing funny happens. This is a boring slog devoid of any laughs. The direction itself is just awful. Scenes just look cheaply made, rushed, and phoned in. Did I mention how lazy this all feels?\r Even the usually amusing Jason Segel gives a lifeless performance. You can tell he doesn't take it seriously as he horrendously overacts. It almost seems like he's trying to make fun of how awful it all is. The rest of the cast just looks bored. They are given nothing to work with though. It seems like no one involved wants to be there at all. Except maybe Diaz. You can tell she's actually trying.\r The only good part of this movie is Diaz's bare butt. It only makes 3 appearances onscreen and isn't worth suffering through this movie to get a glimpse at. The movie has nothing to say about it's rather taboo core concept. It has nothing to say about pornography, it has nothing to say about sex, and it has nothing to say about relationships. That last one makes it kind of weird during the times the movie tries to become a rom-com. The biggest issue it has is that it's devoid of laughs. That issue kills this comedy.\r I give \"Sex Tape\" a 3.5/10."

It's one of the funniest and most original comedies I've seen since The Hangover and it was on pace for a 10/10 rating. Then the writers had the ultimate fail and ruined the plot.\r The film follows Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz as they go from young lovers to married with children who don't have the same love life they once did in their youth. In order to spice things up, they decide to make a sex tape and record it with Segel's iPad. In a sharing snafu their intimate moment is shared with everyone who has been an iPad by Segel in the past... approximately half a dozen people. Now the adventure begins. The two of them have to go track down these iPads and delete the video from them before their friends and family members discover the newly added flick. Oh man are there some amazingly hilarious scenes. Unfortunately, the writers didn't understand how awesome this was and after acquiring one of them, the movie takes a drastic turn for the worse. Instead of making a film where they go from adventure to more chaotic adventure, the movie loses much of its excitement after being confronted and blackmailed by a ten year old. After this point, while there were still a few funny moments, the movie was largely predictable and lacked the same feeling and magic.\r Overall I still suggest the movie to people who don't mind crude humor but it's no longer the must watch that it could've and should've been."

      "text": "From the cast and crew that brought you Bad Teacher, comes Sex Tape, and on the surface it had all the makings of the next big comedic hit. Many people were saying that Sex Tape could be the next Hangover, as it is an original idea with an all-star cast, but sadly it falls well short of expectations. Annie & Jay's marriage has become a little stale, so one night they decide to spice things up by making a Sex Tape. Jay is a music producers and inexplicably neglects the fact that his laptop is connected to many other devices, and the tape finds its way to the cloud. Once again, Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz have absolutely no chemistry. They are too different types of actors that just don't compliment each other and they are even less believable as a married couple. If that were the only issue with this film, maybe I could have gotten passed it, but the real problem, as with Bad Teacher, is that the writers don't know their audience. This is an R rated film about a sex tape and in no way meant for children, yet the jokes are on a sixth grade level. As an adult going to see a raunchy comedy, I'm not interested in jokes about erections and diarrhea, it's in very poor taste and isn't something many adults will respond to. This film is supposed to be a laugh out loud comedy, but there was barely even a snicker in the movie theater, which basically tells you all you need to know about this film. Sex Tape is trying to get people to see it under the guise of being raunchy and featuring some pretty attractive stars, that fans hope they will get to see naked. The truth is that it is very amateurish, you really don't see all that much, and the jokes could be out of PG movie. All in all, Sex Tape is a big disappointment and a huge waste of time."
