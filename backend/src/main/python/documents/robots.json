Maybe a few arcs could have been taken out, and some jokes missed their marker, it made up for it with a pleasant story that didn't make me want to wretch halfway in, when the hero usually falls in love. Again, just because it's enjoyable doesn't mean it's a work of art. But still, nice."

      "text": "Actually a solid and entertaining animated movie but I don't think it holds up well enough today. It was also not that good that it could start a franchise or be remembered. I watched this movie in cinema back then and while I enjoyed it I forgot it existed until recently. For the movie: Imagine a world that is like ours but instead humans it is populated by robots. When the robot couple Herb and Lydia Copperbottom want a son they get via construction kit (Sounds legit for robots). Also growing / becoming older is getting upgrades aka new bigger parts. Her son Rodney has a sharp mind and wants to become a scientist / inventor like the famous Bigweld who is rich, respected and famous. His journey starts when he wants to travel to Robot City to meet his idol. It is a classical heroes journey. However it is quite a bit foreseeable and uses a lot of cliches and tropes. Back then the cast and humor distracted me enough to not notice it. Today I was amazed how I could not spot this immediately. The cast aka voice actors save this movie. It is almost an all star cast. We have Ewan McGregor as Rodney, Robin Williams as Fender, Mel Brooks as Bigweld, Halle Berry as Cappy and Amanda Bynes as Piper to name a few. Excellent performance and I praise the whole cast. Now to the style and animations. Something can be really good but not to your liking. I would never call these cheap, ugly or weak. It is just not my cup of tea. However I praise the bravery to try something new and the dedication of the team. The soundtrack was fine but I also forgot it too. Overall this is in the realm of movies that are enjoyable but fast forgotten. Today it would be rated lower as more and more great animated movies set the bars higher."

A fitting successor to \"Ice Age\", this animated motion picture is both funny and intelligent. I just howled at the scene with Fender teaching Rodney to make whoopee cushion noises with his arm pits, then the Rusties follow suit, leading to an encore by Aunt Fanny, to put the \"fun\" in dys_fun_ctional."

      "text": "I watched Robots wondering whether I was going to love it or hate it. In the end, I liked it, but I couldn't help feeling disappointed too. The computer animation was definitely the best element to the movie, it was stunning with plenty of colourful, advanced and inventive visuals. I also thought the soundtrack was more than decent, I liked the premise and there are some characters that are endearing. The film does have a good message about following your heart. Not to mention a great voice cast, with Ewan MacGregor his usual charming and earnest self as Rodney, Greg Kinnear a nice surprise as Ratchet and Robin Williams wonderfully electric(and funny). There are some heart warming moments with Rodney and his family.However, as Bigweld Mel Brooks did disappoint; surprisingly there wasn't much to his character and Brooks sadly couldn't do anything with what he was given. While it was an enjoyable film technically, the story while constantly inventive and original takes a while to get going, and there is little character development. Also I got more the impression that Ratchet's mother Madame Gasket was more the villain than him. Speaking of Madame Gasket, I couldn't believe Jim Broadbent voiced her, totally unrecognisable and quite possibly the biggest casting surprise of the movie. The biggest flaw though was the script. I will admit I did laugh a few times, but that wasn't enough. Robin Williams did a great job and some of what he said was funny. However, the in-jokes weren't as funny as they should have been. It could have done with more wit and irreverence perhaps.All in all, I liked the movie. It is nice to look at and technically accomplished, and the voice cast in general do well, but the script wasn't sophisticated enough. 6/10 Bethany Cox"

Lo que si puedo destacar son los gr\u00e1ficos y el estilo art\u00edstico muy bien marcado, son bastante coloridos y detallados, algunos dise\u00f1os de personajes son memorables y incluso en parte esta algo adelantado a su tiempo. Pero quitando eso, la historia es muy predecible, con situaciones y personajes cliche, y sin contar cosas que se desaprovecharon o no se terminaron de desarrollar como el hecho de que exactamente no dicen la raz\u00f3n de porque \"Gran Soldador\" abandona toda su empresa y Ratchet y su madre invaden todo. La verdad es que esta es otra de esas pel\u00edculas animadas que tienen muy mala historia, humor forzado y buena animaci\u00f3n y ya con eso cautivan a los ni\u00f1os, como cuando a mi me cautivo hace ya muchos a\u00f1os.

      "text": "For a start; \"timeless\" is only relatively correct. Though this tries to refrain from associating with any pop culture at the time of 2005 and focuses more on political concepts like stocks, abuse of power, and poverty, in terms of production quality and execution of its concept, it shines, shines, shines as a late 2000s film and always will.However, it being partially outdated doesn't mean it's a film of mediocrity. Rather, it is not worthy of being called mediocre. It is an original concept and it has an original manner of managing its themes, although those themes in question are generic, along with the characters associated with this theme. I know this film would be absolutely libeled if it were released in the 2010s and I know this because, people who use their nostalgia to excuse any sort of objective quality something they experienced in their formative years may actually present of itself only like it for that reason and that if it were released in current time, they would shower it in negativity and criticism, never giving it a chance to simply exist.This is one of those films that should remain how it is. It should stay in 2005 and in peoples' formative years and stay in that perception only.Now in terms of the film itself, for a start, the way that it introduces characters in general is the way fictional media of actual quality introduces its characters, completely skipping any sort of name-based introduction and going straight to introducing their characteristics to the viewer. This is due to it not wanting to waste time with long periods of absolutely nothing valuable and going straight into the action. For example, the first speaking character's first line is \"Yahooo!\" about becoming a father, of whom the son is the main protagonist, and there isn't the film equivalent of a cold open where the [secondary] villain narrates. It doesn't want to divert our attention away from the plot. Instead, it waits for the real villain to be introduced after the protagonist tries to visit his idol, and fails because the company was taken over, sending out new policies and whatnot.The political messages can't make themselves anymore obvious, of course. Most of it is about the acceptance of intellectual ability among the social norms, the financial instability of the commoner, and the lengths a corporate conglomeration is willing to go to make a profit, of which is the equivalent of killing robots with no financial gains for their remaining parts. Eventually this ends with a final battle, of which lasts 5 minutes and the sidekick killing the main antagonist in their own furnace and the secondary antagonist causing himself to get into the same fate as his father, symbolically so. Though it may not seem like so, the political side of this film is dark compared to the comedic and characteristic side, as if it is not made obvious by the main antagonist, Madame Gasket, being a sadistic underground industrial dictator whose main assistants are the Sweepers, and eventually the Super Sweepers, patent pending from Ratchet. Typically, the main goal of the final battle for the main antagonist was to finish off the main characters and then set the Super Sweepers off into Robot City, of which was obviously a failure. Due to the in-universe urgency of this desire to set them all off, the battle between good and bad was basically forced into becoming 5 minutes long. Which is actually a rational decision on the director's behalf."
