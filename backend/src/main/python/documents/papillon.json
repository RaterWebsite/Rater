      "text": "After appreciating the 1973 original, I honestly didn't think I'd enjoy viewing the remake; but I did. Not a great movie, but enjoyable. It's primary purpose, I think, was to show how terribly cruel men can become when they're given too much power over other men. It's definitely worth seeing, but it's not for young children."

Muy buenas actuaciones de charlie hunnam y rami malek, excelentes maquillajes y una fotograf\u00eda casi impecable todo bien manejado por \u00e9l director michael noer. Muy recomendable"

      "text": "As I was watching \u201cPapillon\u201d a few thoughts went through my mind such as:1) Why did I come to see this movie?2) When will I learn it is okay to walk out of a boring movie?3) Charlie Hunnam could walk into Daniel Craig\u2019s shoes as James Bond and I don\u2019t many would know the difference.4) Hopefully Rami Malek\u2019s next movie as Freddie Mercury in \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d will be a big hit because as he tries to make the move from television star, with his series \u201cRobot\u201d going into its last season, \u201cPapillon\u201d isn\u2019t helping him.5) Why does Hollywood continue to spend millions on making remakes when very few are as good, and even few better, than the originals? Especially those that are thought of as classics or have had unforgettable leads?6) Does adding more violence and/or more nude males in prison make a movie better?7) Though I am not familiar with previous works of Charlie Hunnam he does express a lot with just his face and emotions he is feeling but, right now, he is not quite the Steve McQueen of the 1973 original \u201cPapillon\u201d.Obviously, my thoughts strayed as I was watching the movie or turning my head away with some of the gratuitous violence but the bottom line is the story screenplay and none of the actors drew me into the movie to knock those thoughts out of my head.The next remake coming up is \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d starring Bradley Cooper, who also directed, and Lady Gaga. I have seen and am a fan of the original and the two remakes, each for different reasons, and am hoping this new version will be the exception to the rule about remakes and be their equivalent.The bottom line is I found \u201cPapillon\u201d a bore and would suggest you watch the original as that is a film that Hollywood doesn\u2019t make, a two-star action prison film epic that you really believed happened."

So the book is 64 times better.Don't see this movie. Buy the book, settle in for a day, a be prepared for total amazement, inspiration, entertainment, and awe. THEN buy the next book Banco which tells about Papillons life after escape. Follow my advice be bored and waste a precious day of your life. Your choice!"

      "text": "This remake of the remarkable true story sentences Charlie Hunnam and Rami Malek to the brutal penal colony in French Guiana for misery, struggle and 2 escape attempts. Thru it all, their friendship prevails. This relentlessly cruel and desperate situation is effectively portrayed, but Hunnam brings only steely determination to his portrayal\u2026not much depth. The character weakness in Malek's character makes it easier for him to be more sympathetic. Still, this is more about the wretched conditions than about human resolve, leaving it bleak and less powerful that the story deserves."

      "text": "Malek and Hunnam's performances can't save this film from the overly long run time and slow pace. So much of this film could have been edited down, Especially that near 20 minutes long solitary confinement scene, but wasn't and that's what really kills it for me. It's not exciting, It's not interesting. It's boring and it fails to keep your interest."

      "text": "This is a remake of the 1973 movie that starred Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman.  I thought i remembered liking that movie, but I am not so sure now.  In this new version, Charlie Hunnam plays the title character and Rami Malek plays Degas.  They both do a great job of portraying their characters, and you will find that you really care about them.  But, the movie is so dark, humorless and relentlessly depressing, that it is difficult to sit through.  I kept wishing I was watching it on DVD so I could fast forward through some of it.   Because it is so dark, I would not recommend it.  But, if you really want to see it, wait until it comes out on DVD so you have the option of fast forwarding or walking away from it.   Plus it is way too long.  There were at least a few places that the movie could have been edited much better to save time."

      "text": "Both Charlie Hunnam and Rami Malek give good performances but lack chemistry and considering the story is entirely based on their characters that becomes a problem.It's entertaining enough but its narrative rhythm doesn't do any favors to it, especially considering the slowness with which the first half hour unfolds but the film gets recovered and although it will not leave any memorable impression or I doubt you talk about it after finish it I think it deserves the opportunity to be seen."

      "text": "This movie missed a real chance to be something special. All the ingredients are there, two very strong leading roles, a story with real potential, but somehow it all just doesn't exactly fall in to place. I enjoyed myself for large parts of the movie, but also found myself desperately wishing for the end of some scenes that got dragged on for far to long. That being said, Charlie Hunnam has come a long was since Green Street Hooligans, and will hopefully make an appearance in another movie that better suits his talents. He and Rami Malek both play excellent roles, it's the writers that fail to bring emphasize the chemistry between the two characters that is obviously there (hence the coconut scene). Conclusion, this movie could had the potential to be a lot better, but thanks to it's leading actors, was still acceptable to watch."

      "text": "A story about a man that was too arrogant, and got himself into jail. From that point on, his story transforms into one about heroism and strength as he never gives up on his hope to escape the hellish prison in French Genua in 1931. .What strikes me the most from watching this movie, is the sheer strength in Papillon to survive 7 years of solitary prison, and yet not give up. By the time he does escape, and probably settles in Venezuela, the world is at the tipping point of going into World War II. For this man however, that must have weight much less considering what he has been through.Despite what some critics are saying with 'this movie offers little', i judge every story for what it is. And the story in this movie was very interesting and entertaining to watch. It's an excellent movie, and i give it an 8/10."

Tout y est en effet sans relief et sans g\u00e9nie, tout baigne dans la m\u00e9diocrit\u00e9 d\u2019un remake poussif du film original de 1973, un classique \u00e0 la mise en sc\u00e8ne brillante de Schaffner et servi \u00e9videmment par deux acteurs exceptionnels\u2026Or, ici le charismatique McQueen est remplac\u00e9 par un bell\u00e2tre (pour ne pas dire une andouille) qui joue comme un pied et quant au r\u00f4le d\u2019Hoffman, si Malek n\u2019est pas un mauvais acteur en soi, il ne peut certainement pas rivaliser avec le monstre sacr\u00e9 !A tenter de visionner ce truc, on ne cesse de le comparer \u00e0 son a\u00een\u00e9, lequel malgr\u00e9 son \u00e2ge v\u00e9n\u00e9rable ne s\u2019en laisse pas compter par le petit nouveau, loin de l\u00e0 ! un vrai bleu-bite, ce Papillon moderne qui sonne creux et faux \u00e0 l\u2019instar de sa r\u00e9alisation de t\u00e9l\u00e9film ; on s\u2019irrite de ses maladresses, c\u2019en devient un supplice \u00e0 suivre : on arr\u00eate donc les frais rapidement et on tire la chasse, point merde."

I think its primary purpose is to show how heartless and cruel Humans can be when there are given way to much power. The two Main Actors have some chemistry together but sadly it never reaches the same Level of believable Friendship like in the Original Movie. But still if you don't expect to much you have an solid Adaptation of the Book. Overall nothing Special but an enjoyable Movie with interesting themes, so its worth watching."
