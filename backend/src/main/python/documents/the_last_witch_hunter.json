  "description": "The modern world holds many secrets, but by far the most astounding is that witches still live among us; vicious supernatural creatures intent on unleashing the Black Death upon the world and putting an end to the human race once and for all. Armies of witch hunters have battled this unnatural enemy for centuries, including Kaulder, a valiant warrior who many years ago slayed the all-powerful Witch Queen, decimating her followers in the process. In the moments right before her death, the Queen cursed Kaulder with immortality, forever separating him from his beloved wife and daughter. Today, Kaulder is the last living hunter who has spent his immortal life tracking down rogue witches, all the while yearning for his long-lost family.",

Special effects are awesome, someone claimed a few laughable scenes but I didnt notice one that pulled me out of the moment. The story is decent with a little more depth than some give it credit for. A few missed opportunities to show us the struggles of living with immortality. Some of the dialog choices did make me wonder but with a movie like this its to be expected. Movie is great for what it is action movie + Vin Diesel + witch lore = decent popcorn flick."

The plot has so many flaws which ruins the quality of the film. There is just something missing and things that could have been done so much better. I wouldn't go as far as saying this is one of the worst films ever made but it is a massive disappointment. This film falls in to the category of its really well advertised but the film itself is not so great. Which ultimately, when it comes to watching makes it worse. There are scenes where they didn't go far enough and it felt like they were holding back."

The movie is one massive clich\u00e9, with such awesome things like endless dream sequences with a twist, having loved and lost, left with hard shell, woman busts through hard shell, love at last, main character losing power and regaining power, main character being tossed around like a **** doll ending with him lying on the ground for a while... you know the rest.\r It's not ball achingly bad, but if you've seen your fair share of action movies you'll be able to predict every scene, plot twist and ending. In other words, it brings absolutely nothing new to the table. If you're a creature of habit that just can't deal with innovation you'll love this movie."

But visually there is a lot here borrowed from a lot of things to do it's own thing. From The Witcher to Dungeons & Dragons to The Highlander. Taking the BAMF archetype and chucking them into the modern age isn't a new thing. But I clearly enjoyed it for what it is. There's flaws a'plenty but there was enough here for me to sink my teeth into the crap I like watching, simple as that. Pretty slick CGI for a movie of its budget too.\r We don't see original characters or original fantasy worlds much on the big screen these days, so maybe I'm just hungry for it. But I enjoyed the ride for the most part and I think it's worth a shot if this looks mildly appealing to you."

      "text": "The Last Witch Hunter casts many mismatched fantasy gimmicks like a desperate magician, lacking identity and any real magic.\r Say what you will about Vin Diesel, the guy has performed a variety of roles. From the famous furious action series, sci-fi, family comedy and even the lesser known crime drama, he's a legitimate blockbuster draw. However, in his recent fantasy escapade, he's bogged down by the same flaws from Constantine and even Van Helsing; far too much stylish fireworks and lacking any real focus on narrative.\r The Last Witch Hunter tells the story of Kaulder, an immortal who hunts witches for centuries. Straight from the first act, the movie tries to jam as many expositions as possible while panning through myriad of hidden exotic locations practically every five minutes. It feels like a rushed tour of New York and none of CGI view made lasting impression.\r This is a missed opportunity since the occult version of modern city is teeming with potential. Other movies, even comic books and video games have used this premise to captivate audience effectively. The screenplay could've showcased the mythology with calm pace and imaginative scenery, yet the movie abruptly shifts between uninspiring random clubs, which makes the entire environment seems generic.\r It doesn't have to be Hellboy 2 level of sophistication, but the lore available feels terribly underutilized. Visual is mostly crafted with CG, and the action is mediocre with crude choreography. Underneath the cosmetic spells, the production value feels simply average, far too similar to Constantine from last decade.\r This rushed pace is also translated to the characters, which appear like random strangers meshed together and suddenly given strange development. This is not on Vin Diesel alone, the movie has good acting prowess with Elijah Wood and Michael Caine, among others, however the characters are nothing more than stereotypical eccentric magicians or familiar villain. At some points it even looks like some cop procedural series with awkward buddy gimmick.\r Lastly, Vin Diesel himself isn't that convincing even though he's groomed for superhero epic. In fact, he fared much better as Riddick, at least he had an identity as the stealthy assassin. While as Kaulder he's just another grunting protagonist despite the presentable physique or the grand attire.\r The Last Witch Hunter is a fantasy foray filled with shallow parlor tricks and incompatible hero in Vin Diesel. It had potential to be spectacular, but the shoddy presentation only offers pedestrian exhibition."

Think \u2018The Lord of the Rings\u2019 meets \u2018Blade\u2019 but without the narrative and visionary brilliance of the former, or the originality and cool factor of the latter.\r Director Breck Eisner attempts to craft a dark but family friendly contemporary all-action fantasy by combining a well-trodden narrative and mild horror with plenty of CGI and spectacular magic imagery, plus convenient religious iconography and a dash of ineffectively mixed humour & drama.\r The result, although entertaining enough, is a mess that fails to impress or engage despite the efforts of its star, who\u2019s now exhausted \u201cFast & Furious\u201d charms don\u2019t add layers to the stereotypically badass but shallow character \u201cKaulder\u201d, and no amount strategically placed dead family flashbacks will convince you otherwise.\r Diesel\u2019s co-stars Rose Leslie and Elijah Wood do their best with pedestrian modernist fantasy dialogue, but even Michael Caine in his now customary mentor/confidant role can\u2019t save the characters in \u2018The Last Witch Hunter\u2019 from drowning in the frenzied action and convoluted narrative.\r With impressive action set pieces and striking visuals and with a duration of just shy of 2 hours, \u2018The Last Witch Hunter\u2019 is not entirely without merit as fantastical escapist entertainment. No doubt its producers will be hoping they\u2019ve found a Vin Diesel vehicle off which they can build a franchise, and with many of the mass appeal modern components for success there we won\u2019t be surprised if this is the first of many \u201cKaulder\u201d films.\r The Bottom Line\u2026\rFun, flashy but forgettable, \u2018The Last Witch Hunter\u2019 walks a very familiar cinematic path without offering anything much to remember it by, a reasonably entertaining way to burn a couple of hours which you\u2019ll forget as soon as you leave the cinema\u2026 that is until the inevitable sequels."

      "text": "Certainly better than the average CGI, fantasy flick. While falling into some similar plotting traps we've seen to often from films of the like, the movie as a whole succeeds thanks to a cast made up of likable, talented actors. The impressive visuals and stylized world help as well.\r Plenty of fantasy mumbo-jumbo is floating around. With plenty of lore and magic flying around there are occasional moments that get jumbled and confused. For the most part though it's all pretty easy to follow. Especially since the core plot hits some familiar notes.\r We've seen this before. Powerful guy who lost his family deals with a returning evil. Heck, even the immortality part rings a few bells. That's a death sentence for most movies. For some reason though it feels like slipping into a well worn glove with this one. Comfortable and familiar.\r The cast all play their familiar character types with a lot of charisma and talent. But what else could one expect with talent from the likes of Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, Nolan's Batman trilogy, and Diesel himself making up the main cast? Obviously we are going to be treated to more fantastic performances.\r A lot of great special effects bring the magic to life. The world is vibrant and often colorful. The action is a little lacking, but overall very entertaining. This is an all around pleasant film to look at, and not just because of Rose Leslie.\r But what's the real saving grace of the film? What sets it above the average fantasy shlock? Simply put, it's not cheesy. There's no sense of camp, overacting, or inherent goofiness to take all of this into the painful, eye-rolling territory that it otherwise could have landed in. The lack of stupid one liners cannot be under appreciated.\r So despite having a very familiar premise there's enough good here to make it worth a watch. A talented cast and attractive world breath new life into it's recycled elements. While still not perfect it's an enjoyable dark fantasy action movie that somehow manages to defy the odds and elevate above the likes of say \"Seventh Son.\"\r I give the movie a 7.5/10"

The dialogue is way too serious and there are several lines that are just not suitable for Vin Diesel. He's fine for most of the film but there are a few scenes where you can tell he's out of his element. There are also roles from Michael Caine and Elijah Wood and neither one of them are really used enough or really even need to be there. Then in the ending we get an even more unneeded plot twist that really does nothing for the story that they just threw in because they could.

There was lots of action, so it does not feel like a fantasy film, which is merely the idea of film concept. From the director of 'Sahara', the story of an cursed with eternal life witch hunter named Kaulder. Except the opening, the remaining film sets in the present New York city where he has to stop a witch who is trying to bring back the witch queen from the dead.\r It was just another those films where the ancient meets the modern world. Okay, I agree a few films did impacted from the last two decades since the evolution of the CGI. Even though, they were not considered the greatest, in the meantime, I don't know where did this one come from. It was not based on any book, but I think just to make a few quick bucks using the star power. Other than that this film offers nothing new.\r Yes, I liked the Diesel's presence in this, but he should not do films like this, except if the screenplay and role developed to his caliber. It was not a big box office hit, but merely survived and critically didn't. Even the film fanatics and fans of the star disappointed with it. Now I can't believe the sequel is announced, but I hope it won't take off. Anyway, it could become a decent television series rather than a film franchise.\r Diesel is the reason for this film to look okay and the story was maybe the hundredth time used. Come on we all know this story, but with a new cast and the settings, it looks different. So for me the film was an average, other than that, I don't think it is worth recommending to the others.

What amuses me most is this movie's attention to details, allegories and sometimes even satire for human society.\rThis is not a movie for everyone I might say, but if you find it's tune you will definitely put it to your collection and will watch it again from time to time."

      "text": "I don't know, maybe I'm just not into witch theme or something? I saw a really similar movie which came out before this one, which basically had the same plot more or less - a witch is coming back and a hunter needs to kill it. And even all the other things in the plot were quite similar, can't recall the movie though, but the fact that it reminded me of that first movie so much, made it feel a bit boring. Also, even though I like Vin Diesel in Fast n Furious franchise, here the movie didn't make me believe that he actually could be a witch hunter. Plus all the actions scenes were so predictable and nothing interesting really happened. Besides that - his strategy at the beginning was to go straight into traps of witches. Just like Bond does in his movies - lets bad guys catch him and then escapes. Here there was a bit of a similar theme, which I find to be a bit dumb. At least explain why he just goes to some witches who try to control his mind etc. Of course it plays out ok for him, but anyway. Only thing which was interesting maybe was that Elijah Wood's character betrayed him, which was unexpected."

      "text": "Interesting themes and ideas plagued by poor execution and bad writing. The directing relies on flashiness and quick cutting when longer takes and more physicality would have been better. The actors are good enough; this was a passion project of Vin Diesel's, and he fully commits. Rose Leslie is great, but isn't given much to do. Michael Caine is barely on screen. Elijah Wood should have been the emotional and thematic counterpoint, but instead has a handful of scenes that culminate in a massive plot info dump right before the crucial show-down. Overall, it feels like there was a lot left out. A fun enough action film that keeps moving - which is just as well because there is little to savor."

      "text": "Having read some of the reviews that were negatively based, and having watched the film multiple times, all I can say is that this movie will be picked up and watched for some time. Vin is in his element in this movie both bad-ass, and caring at the same time. The cast is very good, with Michael Caine anchoring the whole shebang. As far as lore goes, this movie doesn't follow the mind set that most people would put on Witches, but, with numerous movies changing the way that evil is both perceived and dealt with, I believe this movie stands very high, and is fun to boot. Rose Leslie  is very believable as a witch with a heart, and the Witch queen is a delight of evil."
