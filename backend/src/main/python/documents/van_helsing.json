Blade II uses half that amount, and gives you twice the fun, and axes those annoying Transylvanian accents. Dracula's brides were cool when they didn't talk. That crossbow is a good use of Retro-futuristic imagination. But everything else is a total wreck. How could ILM screw up so badly? Those FX guys worked with Steven Spielburg, for heaven's sakes! Even the musical score fails to deliver. Oliver Stone's disasterous Alexander at least had uplifting, epic music from Vangelis, but this stuff was just garbage. Just watch the mummy movies for hollywood cheese. This blunder doesn't even qualify for those lowly standards."

If you're a fan of old monster movies, James Bond and Indiana Jones flicks, and over-the-top humor in an action/horror movie, then you get it. I guess if you're looking for a summer action flick that takes itself too seriously, then you're out of luck with this one.\r I admit that the film runs a little to long, the chemistry between Beckinsale and Jackman leaves something to be desired, and the Frankenstein \"monster\" (though well-intentioned to give a nod to \"Young Frankenstein\") is really annoying. But the entertainment spawning from the hokey fun that \"Van Helsing\" is all about, makes these flaws so forgivable.\r For me, I'll take the over-acting screaming Brides of Dracula, the silly homages to dozens of classic action and horror movies, the cheesy one-liners, and the not-so-convincing special effects. Isn't that what monster movies are all about?"

This movie is awesome. Amazing storyline, seriously.. A monster hunter? EPIC. I mean, who doesn't like it? It's so good! The werewolves are incredible, the best ones I've EVER seen in a movie. And the vampires? Van Helsing is probably the only movie that shows vampires how they really are: monsters. But sure, people now prefer \"vampires\" who shine like fairies at the sun! Is that even a vampire? Oh right, no. And the werewolves? Nowadays are simply wolves. Van Helsing recreates it as a completely beast, which is what they are! And the CGI? It too damn good! It was 8 years ago and it is still way better than most of the movies we get now! Just.. argh. Seems like people don't know what are good movies. Today, people prefer vampires who fall in love with humans and it's all a big teenager drama than really good stories who give a message. The world is lost. Such a good storyline, such good characters and actors. The CGI is very good and.. then there's the public who actually sucks. Van Helsing is a really good movie."

      "text": "Van Helsing just about works as a film if you don't take it too seriously. It's a fun fantasy romp with numerous references to 30s and 40s Universal horror films. It does have some awful dialogue (it's written and directed by Stephen Sommers, and as with The Mummy and The Mummy Returns, he proves himself much more talented in directing ballsy action sequences than bringing profound vocal utterances to the big screen). It also has some awful performances from its cast (the chief culprit being a laughable, bad Eastern European-accented Kate Beckinsale, but a fairly wooden and inconsistent Hugh Jackman in the title role doesn't fair much better) and the plot is an ugly mess - rather than a glowing tribute to classic horror filmmaking it's a ridiculous throw-everything-but-the-kitchen-sink affair. Despite these glaring issues, Van Helsing could never be called boring. Yes, it might be a bit too long, but the film boasts some fantastic effects (I personally feel that the werewolves featured in the film are the finest in movie history) and the action scenes are handled well - though each set-piece is quite long, the momentum is never lost. You also have a liberal dose of humour and a standout performance in Richard Roxburgh's Count Dracula. Yes, he's hammy, but in a knowing sort of way, and he's a much better actor than Bela Lugosi ever was, and, perhaps most importantly, he appears to be having so much fun with the role. Van Helsing is completely hilarious if it's taken completely seriously, but if you're willing to suspend your disbelief, ignore its more wobbly aspects, it's quite possible to derive a certain amount of perverse pleasure from such a genuinely entertaining film."

The referencing of classic monster movies doesn't only fall flat but it grates. Richard Roxburghs Dracula is over the top in the worst possible way and the scripting is dreadful. If anything its one saving grace is a remarkably entertaining intro to the character of Van Helsing (even if Hugh Jackman is terrible as the title character) with the fight between Jekyl and Hyde being a fun piece of action. Its the films only saving grace and its only 5 minutes. The film lumbers on after that, slowly killing your soul. It's dire and thats before it gets to the end where you get to witness Lion King esque sky visions. Because copying Disney in a monster movie seemed like a good idea at the time.

      "text": "Okay so this movie is stupid. Like, really stupid. All about Count Dracula needing the body of Frankenstein's monster to give life to his children, Van Helsing is a pure mess of a movie and really off-the-wall. With horrific dialogue and bad effects, this one is just a recipe for disaster. However, its campy inclinations and embracing of its more ludicrous elements by bringing them to their completion is what really makes this one a film packed to the brim with raucous entertainment. That said, the everlasting question of the film is: how bad is life in Transylvania? It is bad enough being neighbors with Dracula. However, to accept that the vampires will kill and eat one or two people every once in a while to sustain themselves as a fact of life and an ideal situation is really terrifying. How bad were things before they struck a deal with Dracula?Featuring Hugh Jackman as Van Helsing, the famed archenemy of Dracula, the film tells the story of Gabriel Van Helsing having to go to Transylvania in order to kill Dracula. He is to help save the Valerious bloodline, as they will be stuck in purgatory as a result of their failure to kill Dracula, who was one part of their bloodline before he struck a deal with the devil. By the time he arrives, however, only Anna (Kate Beckinsale) is alive. As with all of Beckinsale's more ludicrous roles, Van Helsing is unafraid to utilize her sex appeal with tight clothing, revealing dresses, and tons of ass shots. She is also largely a damsel in distress here finding herself in situations where men must come and save her. However, the one character I did love, other than Van Helsing himself, is Frankenstein's monster (Shuler Hensley). A compassionate figure in this installation, he was created against his will and, yet, now that he is here, all he wants is to live. Highly sympathetic, it is hard to root against the classic monster in this film.On the flip side, Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) is very easy to root against. Wholly evil, Dracula's large breasted concubines often do his bidding and are truly horrifying to look upon. The special effects on their bat forms are really quite bad and stand out as some of the worst, aside from Mr. Hyde, who is certainly the worst. This said, Dracula himself is well costumed and truly menacing. Roxburg instills him with a stoic deviousness. However, the best part of Dracula is the mythology here. From the ice castle to the missing script to his back story with Van Helsing, it is all very engrossing. With small details sprinkled throughout the film, director Stephen Sommers really does handle the story quite well at times. Though silly and over-the-top, there is a common thread here that binds it all together.Yet, the film cannot get out of its own way. Not only is the acting horrific by Beckinsale and David Wenham, but so is the script. Deviating and often unfocused, the script is over-written, too long, and far too wordy. Though the story does often exceed these problems, it occurs far too sparingly to ignore the issues with the script. Even worse, the conclusion is embarrassing.SPOILERSAfter killing her as a werewolf, Van Helsing buries Anna. As she is finally reunited with her family, we see a vision of her being reunited with her family in the sky and gravitating towards the light. Yikes.END SPOILERSOften really dumb, Van Helsing can also be incredibly fun. Campy, silly, and over-the-top, it is hard to defend the stupidity of the plot, though I really liked the mythology. Unlike other movies of this ilk that came out in the early 2000s such as Underworld, its mythology is its only strength. In Underworld, we had over-the-top, yet solid acting. Solid special effects. And a lot of fun. Here, we get some good fun, but everything else is just so bad it hurts."

Frankenstein's monster is usually depicted as dim witted, but here he's basically a genius.  The action is indeed ludicrous but it can also be exhilarating at times.  I thought the plot was pretty interesting to be honest, especially how it depicts Van Helsing as professional monster killer.  If you don't take it too seriously I'm sure the movie will give you a good time too.

Richard Roxburgh, despite some very cheesy material was good as the count.Unfortunately, these were the only redeeming qualities, to a film that is overall disappointingly uninvolving. What I mean by that, is that there isn't much of a story, which was too many times clumsy and unfocused. The dialogue was eye-rollingly cheesy, I think the count's lines were the worst. I wish I could give some examples, but I can't remember any of the dialogue. The performances were okay, Hugh Jackman certainly acquits himself well, and perhaps the only actor to rise above the challenge. However, Kate Beckinsale seemed to do nothing but act pretty, therefore a rather uninvolving character, and consequently there was little chemistry between her and Jackman.Overall, some good moments save a rather bland and uninvolving film, that also suffers from being overlong, that could have been much more with some better dialogue and a better story. 4/10 for trying.

      "text": "This film portrays Van Helsing's efforts to fight Dracula, which is now trying to give life to his children through the research of the late Doctor Frankenstein. Directed and written by Stephen Sommers, this adventure film has the participation of Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale, Richard Roxburgh and Shuler Hensley in the lead roles.There are certain adventure films, inspired by horror movies, that makes a jumble of elements and characters that have nothing to do with each other. This is one of those films, mixing Dracula to Frankenstein's monster. Even Dr. Jekyll (and his alter-ego, Mr. Hyde) enters the movie! This is not new, has been done in other films and works well when it's done carefully, but definitely wasn't the case here. The script is confusing and makes an attempt to transform Van Helsing, originally a Dutch professor with taste for the occult, in a kind of good supernatural entity destined to hunt down and kill evil monsters. Sorry, but the way this character ended up being \"deconstructed\" was wrong. The director/writer could have made other more interesting options like keeping Van Helsing more faithful to Stoker's novel and try to frame him in a story in the current time, perhaps. The truth is that this film is a clear script error, resulting of flying imagination of its director/screenwriter.The actors were good in their roles, without surprises or special highlights, except perhaps Shuler Hensley, who played a character far from the usual monster, in constant psychological conflict because of his horrid appearance and inner humanity and goodness. The accent of some characters wasn't well done and if the idea was to make them closer to the Romanian universe (when is usually located Dracula's Castle), it failed and became them more humorous than they can be at certain supposedly dramatic moments. The setting, costumes, makeup and sound, visual and special effects are too imaginative, like coming out of a Marvell comic or a graphic novel. The soundtrack, despite the good performance, also didn't stand out particularly.This film is well seeing and entertaining, but doesn't bring big surprises or positively impresses the audience. Far from being a good movie, is ordinary and we see it without big pleasure or expectation."

The characters do not talk like normal people and especially not like people in a vampire apocalypse. 3. Makeup is not very good. 4. Very obvious that this was not a high-budget series."

I also have to note that I thought the cinematography was gorgeous (the purple lighting that was in a lot of scenes; stunning!!!) and that I loved the score and seeing Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale on screen together."
