Did you know it took 12 years to make?"

When do you ever see someone fall in love with someone ugly in movies--and they don't get a makeover? The choice of songs is really good, too. And it's main asset is definitely that it's gorgeous to look at. Sure, the middle portion is really weak and the movie feels a little long all together, but a 25 critics' concensus? Come on!"

      "text": "George Lucas has stated that he made this film with 12 year old girls as the target audience. Ignore the people who state it's too simple or what have you. The character design is an improvement in diversity compared to other films (characters of colour, different looking females, faeries of variety, etc.) and there are multiple good messages embed in the movie. The main theme was romance, but the main female protagonist gets stronger without a romantic interest, saying you don't need romantic love to grow. And if your crush only likes you as a friend, you continue to be a good friend to them.\r I'm giving this movie such a high score, not only because I enjoyed it, but also because it was a way better romance movie than Fifty Shades Of Grey."

The protagonist, it mainly attractive, and the fact that she fell for a not-so attractive character, brings a key message to the viewers, that everybody deserves love. This can be seen in few movies, and that George Lucas decided to carry this message forward is very beautiful.\rThe animation was beautiful, something you can tell, the lighting is impeccable.\rThe music was a surprise, it is over 6 decades of music put into one film, and it brings open a sense of nostalgia to you, the covers and voices are very well done, and I wish there was a PART 2 of this movie.\rBRAVO!"

I thought the film was moderately comedic  and certainly strange, there is a lot of singing. Although the plot line is fairly predictable, the film is very easy to get sucked into. 8/10 :)"

This offers much more and focuses on the ideal that love is found where you least expect.  The beauty of this musical is skin deep, and many will not see it (Critics) and realize how good this movie really is.  The CGI animation is top notch and unmatched, and what else would you expect from a Lucasfilm production.  The soundtrack amazing and the musical numbers were well executed. I truly wonder who funds these critics and if they saw the same movie.  Go see it for yourself and you'll agree it's one of the better animated features to come out in some time!"

      "text": "George Lucas has developed some really interesting characters and woven some extremely entertaining stories during his lengthy career as a filmmaker.  Strange Magic has neither.  The characters are completely undeveloped and bland.  The two fairy sisters, even though they look different, might as well have been the same.  One is blond and one a brunette.  One is really angry and heartbroken, the other is the \"flirty sister.\" Of course, the only reason we know this difference is because they make it a point to tell us that.  \"I need you to help me look after your flirty sister...\" said one character to the other sister.  \"Oh, she's the flirty sister, that's the difference\" I remember thinking to myself.  I can't for the life of me remember what the actual plot of the movie was, and I literally took my kids to see this movie about 3 hours ago.  It was bright and colorful, there were fairies and lots of songs, but the story was so bland that it couldn't even hold my kids' attention for the duration.  My youngest, who's three, took it upon herself to climb out of her booster seat and throw it down the next row in the theater out of boredom.  I really didn't think George Lucas could sink any lower than Jar Jar Banks or the forgettable story from Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, but this movie proved me wrong.  Of course, it was so forgettable it may not matter, as I've been referring to it as \"Strange Music\" all day.  By tomorrow, I might just be trying to remember what I did this afternoon, with no real answer.  I really hope I am that lucky."

This movie is a great excuse to escape for an hour or so, have some fun and maybe remember not to take life so seriously. The characters are all true to themselves and live in believable worlds, but don't have much to worry about... What sets this movie apart for the adults is the depth the characters' emotions go to. Not seen this so well portrayed in an animated film before. They are really acting! Love it or hate it, the experience is worth having. Just remember this is entertainment and enjoy the ride!"

      "text": "Strange Magic..what an oddball film. It's clear this movie is aimed squarely at tween girls, but with such amazing visuals I really had to give it a chance.  The first act is a sappy setup for the rest of the film, and it wasn't long before I was wondering why I bothered.  But then something \"strange\" happened.  I stopped wondering why all the kids in the theater were giggling and laughing and just gave in to the musical.  And then it hit me.  Duh!  It's a _musical_!\r Musical tastes aside, the songs are fun and superbly voiced.  I guess some might wonder why tweens today would care for classic rock and 60s oldies, but I doubt they'll care.  Just don't tell them about ELO, Heart, or Burt Bacharach and they'll sing all the way home with you.\r As for the story, sure, it's not original in its kernel, but it is a beautiful re-telling of A Midsummer Night's Dream.  From the \"ghastly\" reviews I'm seeing I'd say there's considerable prejudice at play, which curiously enough isn't that far from a central theme of the story.\r The bar is pretty high these days for animated features.  Held to amazing stories like Big Hero 6 or Despicable Me, Strange Magic definitely comes up a bit short.  The animation is curiously inconsistent with some pretty lackluster characters contrasted with truly stunning and realistic work.  In the balance, that's clearly the biggest issue and not George Lucas made movie that a grown man won't like."

Between the ear-bleeding songs every few minutes, the unclear stakes, and lack of characters parents will have to grin and bear this one. Despite Lucasfilm pushing the boundaries in computer animation with Industrial Light and Magic this film doesn\u2019t have anything groundbreaking. Lucasfilm has done some enjoyable animation on television with two Star Wars shows making it baffling that their work on film is not worth watching. Much like the love potion in this film you will quickly ignore this lovefest in favor of other more superior films."

      "text": "If you've ever seen the movie Enchanted, this is the kind of movie they were making fun of. I was confused about the plot of this movie when I watched the trailers, and now that I've actually seen the movie, I still don't know what it's about. From what I gathered, Strange Magic has to do with these two sisters/lesbians?, some love potion that causes you to sing a lot, and a troll king. If there's any semblance of a coherent plot, it went way over my head. There seemed to be way too much going on at one time. The story cycle through three main characters at almost two minute intervals, and it got so aggravating that I just gave up trying to follow whatever was happening on screen. One thing I know for certain about Strange Magic is that it lives up to its title; it's strange. The background animation is about as good as you'd expect from a modern animated movie, but the character design is just unintentionally creepy. They look more like demented caricatures than cartoon characters. What makes this movie even more painful to watch is that a majority of the running time is dedicated to covering random pop and rock songs at the most unnecessary times. They cover just about everything: Lady Gaga, The Beatles, Beyonce, Whitney Houston, you name it. Strange Magic may provide a decent distraction for the youngest of moviegoers, but older viewers will just be annoyed by the ridiculous soundtrack and disturbing animation."

They must really have it in for George Lucas because this is to me the best American animated film of 2015 (and this year gave us Inside Out). I'm a guy and not even that big of a fan of musicals and I thought this film was beautiful, charming, uplifting, and funny (Bog's mom has some fantastic one-liners), with a good message to boot. It's an animated version of Moulin Rouge, and the way the characters go from talking to singing and back again is seamless and perfect. The characters' actions seem realistic and believable in this world and I loved how the filmmakers played with a sense of scale, where even a flower is a huge in their world. Again, I'm a straight adult male and I don't normally care about fairies but this film made full use of the concept. This is sure to be remembered as a cult classic down the line. One of my favorite childhood films was Beauty and the Beast and I can compare this favorably to that. If I ever have a daughter, this will be one of the films I show them."

And I give HUGE respect to the idea the bog king does not turn pretty, he physically stays the same. But the pacing is not very balanced. So many songs are THROWN at you all at once, it feels like you're put into a teacup ride that refuses to slow down, not to mention the questionable but graphically impressive lighting and art style. That's the weird thing. It does have soul not it simply isn't very well written. I wish this movie had better editing, less emphasis on songs and dialogue. Because I think the romance DOES WORK. And some of the designs are rather cute when they aren't covered in overly detailed hair and fur. This is an odd but intriguing movie that you should check out ONLY if you are aware it's not amazing."
