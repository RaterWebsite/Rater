      "text": "Allison Janney stars as an under-appreciated housewife who decides to get attention by exploiting her missing husband (Matthew Modine). Since he was indeed involved in nefarious activities, this spirals into a madcap string of events involving an assortment of rather bland characters played by Regina Hall, Awkwafina, Juliette Lewis, Mila Kunis, Ellen Barkin and Wanda Sykes (who manages the only laffs in the whole film playing herself). While all of these accomplished actors are doing their best, the rather bland script doesn't give them much opportunity to shine. Director Tate Taylor (The Help & The Girl on the Train) keeps the pace up and handles the few quick violent scenes with aplomb, but even with the jigsaw puzzle of predicaments, he can't overcome the lack of solid or amusing original writing."

      "text": "Put this down as a guilty pleasure like a car accident you can't stop watching.  It's offbeat and over-the-top but somehow satisfying.  The cast is beyond the plot with memorable character portrayals by Awkwafina, Juliette Lewis, Wanda Sykes, Jimmi Simpson, Ellen Barkin, and Clifton Collins, Jr."
