Wahlberg's last few unstable features corners him to shake Berg's magic hat and draw out the card from it but unfortunately this time, it isn't the card that anyone was seeking for, not even the makers. It inherently gets difficult to rub on a genre that is already almost explored in each way, and addition to that when you feed the audience a wafer thin concept and expects them to be blown away by the blazing barrels; it's a bit much. Not only does the feature surfs around the surface, the characters that it forcibly installs is just pathetically one-dimensional. One of the primary reason why it fails on levels, is its antagonist, which is not kept under any shade but is just non-existent, leaving the audience with the stakes that are all hoax and all distraction. The anticipated twists and turns which are mundane in such genres, is so independent from any of the incidents occurred in the feature, that it nullifies itself; the viewers couldn't care less. It doesn't have any circle that comes around or makes sense, nor any arc or gist to stand on the self-created slippery ground. As much as exciting it is to experience sharp sound effects, its heightened version latter, shucks it all way. A decent background score or cinematography is pure myth in here, although the camera work is intriguing and convincing whose credit goes to Berg's experience. The choreographed action sequences are enthralling with all the actors working hard and investing all their chips in, especially Uwais who easily is the highlight of it. Berg's world in here seems like the first draft of the script, where his weaving of the structure in front of the audience takes out every inch of the thrill that was about to hit them. Wahlberg is annoyingly loud and disappointingly unstable in his portrayal where no supporting cast like Cohan, Rousey and Malkovich, is supporting him. Berg; the director, still needs some work to do especially to work with his editing department, since all crisp is purely hazardous. Few action sequences and sharp sound effects are the only high points of this sinking feature. Mile 22 has a long way to go, probably more than it titles for, but in the end it too wouldn't matter since they are following the wrong directions."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Love the actors, very good action.Story is ok but hey its an Actionmovie.Thanks Peter Berg"}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Mile 22 starts out with a bang and has an excellent surprise action sequence - however after that the story becomes less enticing.  Mark Wahlburg's character for whatever reason is very annoying and can't seem to keep his emotions in check.  You would expect a more level headed individual for a person in his position but that unfortunately is not the case.  Wahlberg's character comes off as a narcissistic, emotionally unstable lunatic who is constantly snapping a Lance Armstrong type bracelet against his wrist.  Both his personality and the bracelet snapping become more and more annoying as the movie progresses.  What makes this movie somewhat watchable is the mind numbing action sequences but with nothing else to provide beyond that - I have to give a 3/10."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I just saw this movie which I can\u2019t remember the name but it has Agent Marky Mark in it and a girl who looks hot but she\u2019s dangerous and can\u2019t wear makeup but if she was in a makeup role she probably could maybe be as hot as the Black Widow girl. Also that girl wrestler who\u2019s trying to act now who should just keep wrestling.They work for a secret organization that\u2019s more secret than the CIA that\u2019s called the ADHD.The story is there\u2019s hardly any killing for the first two minutes and then lots when they go out and get in cars and trucks and fight guys on motorcycles. The hot girl has phone calls with a mean husband and wants to talk to the daughter but he won\u2019t let her but that part goes away. The big boss is cool because he\u2019s called Mother (the guys are called chess pieces and then children) and he has all these cameras that say their heartbeats and stuff and he\u2019s super cool because he has bobble-heads that go into a special case and he wears old-fashioned sneakers.The style is sometimes Mother says philosophy and I think Marky Mark does too but he talks really fast and lots so I couldn\u2019t tell. And Marky Mark always snaps a rubber band and the bad guy is always touching his fingers to his thumbs and that was the only dumb part of the movie that I wish they didn\u2019t have because I wanted it to stop all the time.No scene lasts for more than five seconds so the movie goes by really fast and I won\u2019t give away the ending but I will say what a surprise.The only thing I couldn\u2019t figure out was why there were no policemen or ambulance men or firemen.

With ridiculous and weak plot and hyper aggressive protagonists. For starters, they show us how Mark Wahlberg has 'special abilities' and thus joined The Overwatch, yet, none was shown in the movie. Did I miss something here?Lauren Cohan who's divorced with a daughter can't hold her emotions and behaves like a teen which is so silly since she's supposedly a trained agent. The f-bombs are everywhere among the team at every sentence and Wahlberg should talk aggressively to make you feel more intense even for the unnecessary lines.About the city the whole film was based on, it was supposed to be in some South Eastern Asian country. Instead, they decided to take it in Columbia. Like seriously? Just to save some budget?Won't go through all the silly plot like 7 motorbikes could easily take down a fleet of \"The greatest country in the world\" by surprise, or the ridiculous scene where they needed a plane to take down a car blocking the way to the runway, or the implied political correctness statements by female agents, one by Cohan saying \"You think if I'm a woman I can't hurt you?\" to Uwais and the female programmer who says \"Most code is written by men, so I can see this code is written by a woman.\" This is the most stupid sentence I've heard. As a software engineer myself, you can't \"distinguish\" a code if it's written by a man or woman, and no, you can't identify the ethnicity either. It's not a poet or a literature piece. It's like saying this math formula was written by man or woman. But I can say this movie was written by a 12-year-old!Sure, the 'twist' in the end was so funny and bad. It should be a shame for the intelligence of the US of A if such incident happened in real life."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "If you're in the mood for a mindless action movie then find something else because Mile 22 is absolutely awful. CIA agent Marky Mark and friends team up to escort a police officer with sensitive information out of the country before the bad guys get him. Mile 22 is the boring escort mission in your standard video game. Dull, predictable and if given the choice you should skip it.James Silva (Mark Wahlberg) has quickly become one of the most hated movie characters in movie history. I wanted to jump into the screen and punch him in his smug face just so he would shut up and that was just within the first fifteen minutes. I feel like the only reason they cast Iko Uwais is to remind us of The Raid and maybe the action will make up for the laugh out loud script and the mediocre cast. The action might have made up for it but unfortunately it was near impossible to make out anything that was happening due to the poor editing/shaky cam.\u00a0I cannot understand the reason behind this because with a 16 rating it wasn't to hide the violence it was just a mess. I'm a fan of The Raid, how could you not be, yet Iwo Uwais in Mile 22 was completely wasted. A simple idea that in the right hands could have been a crowd pleasing action flick. Even with the short running time it still felt dragged out and bland.

This film is terrible. Mark Wahlberg's character is quite possible the most arrogant and poorly written \"intelligent\" protagonist I've seen in a long time. My guess is that the writer wanted him to come off similar to how Mark Zuckerberg does in The Social Network: a super smart *******, but instead he comes off as a dude who thinks he is smarter than he actually is and just constantly yells at people. Lauren Cohan's character is also not written very well and her anger issues (spawning from her messy divorce) seem drastically overdramatic. The story of Mile 22 isn't anything to write home about, either, as the entire film is about them trying to extract a police officer who says he has the codes needed to unlock a hard drive that has the locations of materials that could be used for terrorist attacks. That isn't really the problem, though, as my main issue with this film's story is how it tries to get the audience to play the guessing game of \"who's the bad guy\" while painting it on the wall in red paint. There's a huge reveal at the end where I'm guessing they thought the audience would be thinking \"holy cow\", but instead I was just severely disappointed. The editing in this film is also absolutely atrocious. In some fight scenes, there would be about three cuts between when someone goes to throw a punch and when it actually makes contact. It's completely disorienting and while I could still keep up with what was happening, it was honestly just too much. It got to the point where the constant cutting was seriously annoying me. The best thing about this film is the somewhat realistic gun play. That's basically the only positive thing I have to say. Overall, this is one of the worst films I've watched in a long time. And I say this because generally whenever I give a film a very negative review I can at least say that it was a competently made film, but I can't say that for this one. It's bad all around."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "This is the most convoluted disjointed unbelievable clown show I ever saw.  Not even Mark Wahlberg could save this one.

It lacked in character development, and whenever a character died the only thing you thought was \"wait, who was that charter, what was their name?\" And they truly wasted their best asset in this movie. An no, I'm not talking about Mark Wahlberg or Rhonda Rousey, I mean Iko Uwais. Best known for his work in the foreign movie The Raid. He is an amazing martial artist and every scene he was doing his thing, they ruined with many cut scenes and \"shaky\" cam footage. They took these ok to solid action movie actors, added a plot done many times before, threw a lazy \"twist\" at the end, and turned into what should have been a straight to DVD movie."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Mark Wahlberg teams up for the 4th time with director Peter Berg. They've made some great action films together (Lone Survivor, Deepwater Horizon & Patriots Day). This is their least successful collaboration, but it's still got some solid physical engagement. Wahlberg plays the leader of a highly-specialized secret ops team that's assigned to transport an \"asset\" 22 miles thru a highly inhospitable city. There are slammin' fights (with the best featuring Iko Uwais), destructive car chases and high-kill shootouts. On the down side, the script is cluttered with too much fast, impenetrable chatter, attempting to sound like Aaron Sorkin dialogue without the smarts. People don't see this genre for the words and there's sufficient violence to satisfy fans."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "A toxic protagonist kills the entire thing. I could have dealt with confused narrative that can't decide if it wants to be a nuanced look at the lives of paramilitary operatives or a first-person shooter game. Even the subpar editing everyone keeps talking about didn't bother me. I liked the action for its barrage of blood and gunfire. Mile 22 was even nice enough to include Iko Uwais kicking butt all The Raid style. I just couldn't enjoy any of it because front and center the entire running time is Wahlberg's character James Silva verbally assaulting friends and foes alike.You know you have a problem when everyone you come into contact with wonders what your major malfunction is. They toss around theories of narcissism or some kind of dissociative disorder, but I find myself siding with the character that said \"he's just an *sshole.\"That's it. That's really all I can say. I've sat down to write this review I don't known how many times now and have hit a roadblock every single one of them. The protagonist's presence is so overbearing that it's hard to notice anything else in the movie. Other than the bloodshed that is. Which means that Mile 22 wastes both Iko Uwais and Lauren Cohan. Mark Wahlberg and Peter Berg's winning streak has come to an end, and it's all thanks to one terrible lead character."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "This was actually a pretty decent, watchable movie. The cast was good, Marky Mark was great and the story was solid.

He got Golden Globe nomination and good reviews for his work. Once again everything seemed fine but he did not learn and since then his career has come to less in films that haven't done anything for his career except to swell his wallet.Now he delivers Mile 22, his fourth consecutive collaboration with director Peter Berg, ironically the quality of his collaborations has been decreasing and definitely Mile 22 is the worst of all, especially for the way he takes its style and narrative rhythm of the book by Paul Greengrass and his Jason Bourne trilogy.It's clear that Mile 22 has a very different approach to the other collaborations of Wahlberg and Berg, especially taking into account that the other three are based on real events, but undoubtedly Mile 22 points to a very basic entertainment and therefore more simplistic.It's a thriller of far-fetched and frenetic action that will probably be liked by any action fan who only looks for bullets and explosions but those who look for something more resonant will not find it here. It's not necessarily bad, but it definitely makes you wonder if it was worth it and in my case it wasn't."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Maybe I am weird, but I think it was refreshing film, better than most current action films with uncommon plot.

The beginning is fun with some cool shots and wicked modern-day technology and modern tactics that really show off how intense an operation, like the beginning one is.

I would love that, but since Mark is not nice and you don\u2019t care/root for him it doesn\u2019t work out as well. The action is cool but very shaky. There is no John Wick type action scene.
