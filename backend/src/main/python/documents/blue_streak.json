In both movies, he played a sympathetic law enforcement agent who let the \"criminal\" go or was indifferent or sympathetic to his escape. In The Rock (1996), he was told that Mason (Sir Sean Connery) was vaporized and could not be apprehended. He smiled knowing he had escaped capture by the F.B.I. In this movie, upon learning Logan is a felon and not a cop, he smiles when he discovers Logan is just inside the Mexican border and can't be caught."
