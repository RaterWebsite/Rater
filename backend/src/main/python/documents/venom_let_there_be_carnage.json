Beware,light spoilers ahead!Hardy and Serkis did a great job carefuly transferring the most interesting part of the first movie into the second one. Regretably,not everyone understands that this is not a marvel \"save-the-world-again-from-a-cliche-enemy\" movie. This a sitcom. The most interesting and intriguing part of the movie is the relationship betbeen Venom and its host. This movie is not a blockbuster. Dont expect to see someone saving the world. This entirely relationship comedy with beautiful visual effects and a descent (maybe not the very best,but still) play from Woody and Hardy boy. Every host in the Sony Marvel Universe received a simbiot similar to his personal character. The first movie villain was all bossy and self-esteemed. Brock got and outcast with a very low level of intellectual behavior. Woody was gifted with a badass maniac. Not so good as he was in the original story,but hey,this is a movie for kids. They still did their best coming as close as they could to total massacre. Serkis did excellent job visualising   every scene in his own,unique way. The only thing i didnt like is that sometimes there was no ending to the one scene before switching to the other - its like he got bored with one scene and just switched to the next one. Still,highly recommended. A lot better than \"Black widdow\" and is just as funy as \"Jackie Chan and the nine rings of power\" ."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This movie is super fun and so easy to watch. Sony definitely did a good job adding to the first film and this movie leaves you wanting more. It\u2019s no Academy Award winner, but it\u2019s absolutely entertaining. It\u2019s goofy, funny, at times even scary. Andy Serkis some how made it all work."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "If journalists hate it then it's a very good movie, not political agenda **** just a good buddy movie and everyone need to see it"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "\u201cVenom Let There Be Carnage\u201d is pretty good. Coming in at a 1 Hour And 30 Minutes Run time this movie is damn good fun if you can overlook all its flaws. From a Critical standpoint this movie has a lot of flaws and isn\u2019t the best movie to grace the screen, but it is damn good fun. The action sequences are way better than 2018\u2019s \u201cVenom\u201d and you can actually see what is going on during the action sequences. The PG-13 does hold this movie back though just like it\u2019s predecessor. The story is ridiculous like the first, but let\u2019s be honest who comes to watch Venom for the story. If that is what you are looking for, I think you will be disappointed. But overall, the pacing is extremely fast and crazy just like it\u2019s great final sequence with Venom Vs. Carnage. The Post Credit scene is fantastic and without any spoilers is worth a ticket for admission alone. Overall, I recommended this movie to fans for marvel and is a step in the right direction from its predecessors. If you can shut off your brain, and not take this movie seriously you will have a great time.  And Yes, There\u2019s A Lot Of Carnage\u2026"}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Venom: let there be carnage is loaded with good special effects, more comedy than originally anticipated and solid performances from both Hardy and Harrelson. However, ultimately the newest installment in the Venom series turned out a sloppy missed opportunity, yearning for that R rating."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Venom: Let There Be Carnage is the sequel to the standalone film Venom, in which journalist Eddie Brock was bonded to the alien symbiote, Venom, and became our anti-hero. In it, we have Eddie Brock doing investigative journalism on the serial killer Cletus Kasady and eventually gets bitten by Kasady who is exposed to his blood and becomes infused to a red symbiote, Carnage, who is evil and wants revenge on Brock. Carnage breaks out of prison and frees Kasady's girlfriend, Shriek, however, Carnage soon grows tired of Shriek as her powers involve shrieking and causing irritating noise, one of the symbiote's weaknesses. Eddie is turned down by his love interest in the movie, which actually largely played up for laughs. Venom and Eddie have trouble getting along, so the symbiote leaves Eddie at one point and literally just starts raging at a rave. At the end of the film, the movie takes place in a cathedral where Shriek and Kasady are wed, and they kidnap Brock's love interest so Venom is there to battle Carnage. Venom is triumphant in the end and there is a end-credit sequence which references Spider-Man: No Way Home. Overall, this was a pretty fast-paced, short-lived movie that probably had too much cringey comic relief. It was still entertaining and pretty fun though."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Pt-BR: Foi um filme divertido de assistir, mas a sensa\u00e7\u00e3o que transmite \u00e9 que ele foi feito para crian\u00e7as. Com piadas infantis e um mal desenvolvimento de um dos vil\u00f5es do filme, ele n\u00e3o consegue usufruir de toda a hist\u00f3ria do Venom nos quadrinhos. Foi interessante ter o carnificina como vil\u00e3o do Venom, mas foi muito mais interessante ver o Kasady como vil\u00e3o do Eddie Brook uma vez que o personagem foi muito mais aproveitado em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao pr\u00f3prio carnificina. A cena p\u00f3s cr\u00e9dito do filme foi fant\u00e1stica para o futuro de como veremos o futuro da Marvel e da Sony no cinema.En-US: It was a fun movie to watch, but the feeling is it was made for kids. With childish jokes and a poor development by one of the film's villains, he can't show us the entire Venom story like the comics. It was interesting to have the carnage as Venom's villain, but it was much more interesting to see Kasady as Eddie Brook's villain since the character was much more leveraged in relation to the carnage itself. The film's post-credit scene was fantastic for the future of how we're going to see the future of Marvel and Sony in film."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Where do I start? Venom\u2019s second movie and third onscreen appearance and they still didn\u2019t get it right. Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is attempting to reignite his failing career as a journalist. When the opportunity to interview notorious serial killer Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson) arises he cannot pass up the chance of the interview of a lifetime. Things don\u2019t go according to plan for Eddie and Cletus becomes infected by the symbiote Carnage who proceeds to skip his execution and bust out of prison. Chaos then ensues.I wasn\u2019t exactly a fan of Venom but it made nearly a billion at the box office so lucky for us we got a sequel. I had slightly higher expectations this time around due to Andy Serkis taking over as director. No offence intended towards Tom Hardy but I never felt he was right for Venom and the role would have been better suited going to Andy Serkis instead but sure we\u2019re here now. The scenes with Harrelson and Naomie Harris are giving strong Natural Born Killers vibes and honestly the only good thing I got from Venom: Let There Be Carnage is Woody Harrelson, he\u2019s a show stealer in any scene he\u2019s in. The rest of the movie feels like a buddy bromance movie between Eddie and Venom. It\u2019s silly, ridiculous and not nearly as violent as it should be although it clearly found some sort of an audience. It didn\u2019t make as much money at the box office compared to the first Venom but considering the state of the world right now it did quite well. The build up to the epic showdown between Venom and Carnage was just another CGI overloaded fight scene. Underwhelming and a quickly forgettable movie. I honestly don\u2019t know why I keep putting myself through this.Look the only way you\u2019re going to enjoy Venom: Let There Be Carnage is to have your expectations as low as possible and just maybe you\u2019ll find it a bit of fun. It knows it\u2019s not a serious comic book movie and it doesn\u2019t try to be either. Recommended for fans of the first Venom movie."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Der Film geht zwar 90 Minuten.

Which if anyone knows the character hes nothing like this. The story is a snorefest of waiting for Venom and Carnage to meet. Which doesn't happen till the last 10 minutes of the movie.

Which is wtf. He has no GF why is this character even in the movie it just takes away from time that should have been spent between Venom and Carnage.

Glad to see the MCU formula shaken up."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "*I love the smell of vengeance in the morning!*What am I saying?! Welcome back, Streamers! This weekend we got the long awaited sequel to one of our favorite anti-hero movies, Venom. Venom: Let There Be Carnage was released this weekend on the big screen, and the MCU has continued it's run of expanding the its universe.*Yes, and they had to before I ate their heads for a snack.*Who said that?! Anyway, for those of you who may remember, Venom was reviewed on our Facebook page years ago. Here's a reminder: \"Venom: '...7.9... Definitely catch the Matinee... If you feel froggy pay full. Entertaining film... A little dragged out and would've appreciated more antagonist development.... But go catch a laugh or two\" and \"the [poor] reviews aren't fair to whether you will laugh or be entertained.... the reviews are right about Michelle... she's awful [in this movie] LOL' \". For this sequel, I must say, the review is almost exactly the same. A major difference comes in the run time being 107 minutes for Venom versus just 83 minutes for Let There Be Carnage. Whereas the first movie dragged on a bit, this movie is short and pretty quick. Actually, almost too quick to the point that nothing really happened. It was a bunch of one liners and explosions. I'm with it, but it's just not typical to what the MCU has produced recently. I think it makes sense for this type of side character of the MCU though. Realistically, this storyline goes nowhere at all. At least with the first film we got introduced to Eddie, the symbiotes and etc. This sequel was literally just a laugh and dash movie that really didn't further anything.*Speak for yourself, turd*Who's calling me a turd? I'm trying to say this movie actually feels funnier than the first. Tom Hardy/Venom have a really funny and fun relationship and dialogue with each other. Kelly Marcel and Tom Hardy did a pretty good job of writing this movie. They even made Michelle Williams remotely palatable in this go round. Either way, viewers know what they came to see. The fights and the laughs were quite entertaining. The biggest flop in this film was Woody's hair piece. That joker was horrible! I'm surprised no one in filming said, \"We have to change this mess.\" Otherwise, the rest of the cast like Naomie Harris are alright for what they do. They made her pretty creepy and crazy and I was for it. They could've done a bit more with her talents, but I'm not mad at it. Either way, the cast and their performances are pretty solid but rushed.*I should be snacking on movie reviewers*I think I need to hurry up. While the MCU rarely misses, Venom: Let There Be Carnage is the closest they can get without missing. They produced an entertaining and funny film but just not typical to their usual cinematic fare. If you enjoyed Venom then you\u2019ll enjoy him even more this time but if you\u2019re looking for a storyline wait for Spiderman: No Way Home. Grab a bowl of popcorn, or the matinee, to make sure your money is spent well. I think that\u2019s all I can say because I might have a symbiote problem.
