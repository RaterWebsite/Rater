Yes, something weird is going on, only Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) is too stupid to realize it! He's so deeply in love with his girlfriend of all of four months, that not only can't he see what's going on right in front of his face, but he doesn't try to talk to her about it, he doesn't try to investigate any of it, he just sort of goes with the flow. People are raving about this noir thriller, when it is one of the most poorly written films I've seen in a while. Major plot holes aside for the moment, there is absolutely no character development, no chemistry between the actors, and worst of all they don't even reveal the main plot until twenty minutes before the thing is over! Yes, it's weird, yes, something is going on, but the writers don't even hint at what that is! They don't even give us a chance to figure out what it could possibly be. At first it was interesting and I was hoping there would be clues to help us figure out what might be going on, that maybe Chris would find evidence or over hear something, but no such luck. Maybe there could have been a scene without him, that gave us some insight, there was absolutely nothing until the very end, when it was all thrust into our faces and even then it really didn't make a whole lot of sense. Without giving anything away, they never answer the fundamental question, why black people? I never liked traditional noir, but at least most of the time the acting is good and you have some idea of what's going on.

Sure, the scares come and when they do they're great. In fact, it could be a brilliant thriller film if it wanted to. It's not one of those movies which have way too many scares, with no focus being put upon the storytelling. The pace of the movie is really fast, which is good as in some horror films you feel like they focus more upon the setup and just deliver jump scares at the end. The performances are really good. Daniel Kaluuya is brilliant in the film. Just watch that scene where he first goes into the Sunken Place, excellent acting. I think Allison Williams goes really under the radar as she also gives a good performance. The screenplay and score was outstanding building that feeling of dread and realization that he couldn't get out of the place but was just stuck here. The story is fabulous with so many inventive and creative things making twists all the time. The final act is great, right when you understand everything on one go in that TV conversation scene.

I figured it was all misdirection for a huge plot twist.  However, after about 45 minutes I started realizing that maybe it wasn't trying to be clever and was simply playing it straight.  Although I held out hope for a major twist it became obvious that the \"twist\" was going to be that the girlfriend was part of the family cult, and I was very disappointed to be right.\"Get Out\" reveals itself to be, in the final analysis, just a middling thriller.  I was shocked to discover that it had received almost universal acclaim.  In my honest opinion, this film is only receiving high marks because of either blind racial solidarity or the fear of being labeled a racist by writing a less-than-glowing review.  It's a competent production - it looks great and has a cool soundtrack - but the actual plot is so flimsy that its attempts at satire are weak.  I can't imagine why anyone honestly thinks that this film is anything other than a mediocre popcorn-muncher that just so happens to include a hot-button political issue in its premise.Daniel Kaluuya gives a great performance as does LilRel Howery.  If it wasn't for them, this movie wouldn't even have been worth watching.  I was disappointed in Catherine Keener's performance; I've admired her past work but here she just phones it in.  The rest of the cast was so boring they're not even worth mentioning.My favorite part of the movie was when Walter, the groundskeeper, came running out of the darkness at Chris.  It was so strange and off-putting that it made the hair on my arms stand up!  That's the kind of stuff you hope for in a horror film but sadly those moments were in short supply.  The other parts that were supposed to be \"odd\" were just forced and cringe-worthy (for instance: Georgina's near-meltdown when her and Chris have their one-on-one conversation).\"Get Out\" is too hollow to be considered profound and too self-indulgent to be considered good entertainment.

The horror is aimed more at black people because this is a deeply rooted fear. Whites have taken or tried to take everything...now they come for the only thing black people have left. Their bodies. It draws upon influences from history in RL, such as Emmett Till and the horrific and controversial nature of his death, and also the belief that physically Black people are superior. Also the mistrust of white people that has been bred into blacks, and the reverse, speaks to racial disharmony, even within this very thread. Also speaks to further ignorance people have of each other and situations. One person here didn\u2019t understand the movie, so so they believed the success had to do with the lead actor being black, another believed there is a reverse racism.  Neither of those is true.  The very definition of racism makes it impossible for such a thing for reverse racism to exist. The word you\u2019re looking for is prejudice. But not so here either.  This is simply a writer who was able to exploit a fear, of a community of people, who happen to not be white. The critical acclaim comes from the fact that these fears have never been on display so openly before.That is why very few if any black people found this movie funny, but did find it horrific, even though fictional.If you didn\u2019t get the gist of the movie, I urge you to research Emmitt Till, George Stinney, Black WallStreet and History Channels Bio On Lynchings and then watch this again, imagining what it\u2019s like to grow up with that knowledge in your head and what would make you afraid we\u2019re you that person on screen.

The only reason critics are praising this is to not get called a racist and to avoid being swept away by the wave of \"Oscars so white.\" It would be refreshing AND TRULY SURPRISING for a black film maker to make a movie, any movie, where the central theme wasn't racism, now THAT would be noteworthy.

The acting is pretty solid (with the exception of Catherine Keener). Daniel Kaluuya is fantastic. Allison Williams, despite a pretty weak track record, holds up her role with aplomb. Milton \"LilRel\" Howery steals the show with his role as the comic relief/truth teller. Peele's direction does a fantastic job with capturing the creepiness inherent in the setup.

The most dissappointing aspect of the movie is that the director actually succeeds in capturing the proper mood of eeriness that hooks the interest of the audience when watching a movie of this category. Unfortunately, the movie crashes and burns when all the pieces start coming together - or rather does NOT come together. The symbolism comes hard and heavy, and many audiences will already know the racial undertones that the plot conveys.  It is actually solidly acted with all the actors going full bore into their respective characters, and the story creates the mood of off kilter discomfort very well when it comes to the interactions between the straight laced protagonist and the surrounding cast.However the movie devolves into a series of illogical missteps that completely undermines the intent of the movie. Nothing is more dissapointing than seeing a movie start off with great promise and anticipation for a satisfying conclusion, than to see it totally fall apart at the wheels no sooner than the start of the second act, and this is precisely when this movie loses its appeal completely.Serious, possibly thought provoking situations foreshadowed at the start of the movie break down into outright buffoonery more akin to a Wayans brothers Scary Movie plot. One particular development is a shark-jumping moment that makes the movie go from psychological thriller to full on science fiction. Many of these twists and the direction that the movie goes into seem to have been to make a symbolic or overt social commentary, something I understand is a point the film is attempting to create. However, the method is clumsy and ridiculously heavy handed. The most disappointing part is that the commentary is on point - but the sacrifice made to story, plot and logic is so insulting to the audience that the imagery is dulled to an afterthought. Many guides to the hidden meanings of this film exist, but as a movie watcher, should we really need to have a guide book to a story in order for it to make any semblance of sense?I am fairly harsh on this movie because it is one of those films where the initial plot is interesting enough to capture you, you invest your time to learn more, and the result is a slap in the face.
