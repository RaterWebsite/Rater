      "text": "Instead of genuinely funny stuff, this film\u2019s major shortcoming is that it relies so heavily on cameos (30+ ranging from Valentino to Willie Nelson to Neil deGrasse Tyson). Ben Stiller (who also directed and co-wrote) and Owen Wilson return as vacuous models, who after years of seclusion, find out that they\u2019re no longer in vogue. The first half spoofs the fashion industry (to mostly lame effect), but when Will Farrell appears as the villain, the focus shifts to an equally unexciting attempt at becoming an action flick. There are a few amusing moments and lots of energy, but the majority of this selfie falls flat. Sadly, the cameos are the most fun thing about it."

Any original jokes they did have for the most part weren\u2019t very funny to start with, and got less and less bearable as the film went on. This was partly thanks to the actors performing the jokes, though, as none of the new characters were likable. Even Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson didn\u2019t look like they were enjoying the film-making process, as they and Will Ferrell weren\u2019t at their best. Even though the film started strongly, the bad jokes and in-originality along with the bombardment of pointless celebrity cameos and unsure actors meant the rest of the film didn\u2019t fair well, to say the least.\r It\u2019s a comedy film, so people are supposed to laugh. I didn\u2019t hear much laughing.\r 39/100 (rounded to 4/10)."

The characters have lost all realism and have become annoying caricatures. Ben Stiller is really, really, ridiculously awful here. As is the actor playing his horribly grating son. The plot is stupid, the writing is completely flat, and it's just not funny at all. I laughed a few times and they were all from Will Ferrell as Mugatu, but even he didn't live up to the potential of his brilliant character in the first film. Penelope Cruz and Kristen Wiig are hardly in it and don't really offer anything other than star power for marketing. It's filled with all-star celebrity cameos, but nothing interesting comes from them. I was thoroughly disappointed with Zoolander 2 as a whole and expected so much more from Stiller and gang."

That said, it was still funny. Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson did great jobs, but as with the first, Will Ferrell stole the show. He was absolutely hilarious. And Justin Bieber's death scene was one of the greatest movie beginnings in the history of cinema (do I have to explain why?).

Just like our sweet and stupid protagonist of it all, Zoolander 2 is intensely hilarious. Sure, I'll admit that the narrative shifts like a stumbling horse, but the encapsulation of madness overwhelms the senses and almost drugs you into laughing. It's thrilling. We get just what made the first one so brilliant and more, some especially excellent cameos. Be warned, those who didn't like the first Zoolander will hate this one even more I fear...Yet for those of us finding the sort of OTT and strange zoolander comedy in the first one, this is really really ridiculously good fun."

      "text": "Even as a huge fan of the first Zoolander I found this sequel to be incredibly disappointing. Let's be honest, there was really no reason for it. Especially not after all these years. Ben Stiller proves this by returning as director, writer, and star all the while lacking any truly worthwhile ideas.\r The whole thing just seems like Stiller came up with a few good jokes over the years that could fit the Zoolander character, but ultimately not enough to make a complete movie. He then proceeded to make the movie anyway. Rather lazily at that too. In order to fill in the rest of the pieces required to make a Zoolander 2, Stiller threw together a haphazard plot, tossed in some cheap jokes, and filled the movie with a plethora of cameos with the hopes that nobody would notice the lack of genuine humor. It all just feels so cheap.\r The world of Zoolander is much more gonzo this time around. It's got so many over-the-top characters and absurd environments. It all not only looks fake, but feels fake as well. A case of style over substance. It's obvious the budget wasn't that high. You can tell the majority of the movie was filmed in front of the world's most obvious green screens.\r I do appreciate Stiller's sense of imagination though. He's content to take nothing seriously and has crafted a world where anything can and probably will happen. It's also nice to see a genuine character comedy nowadays. It's just a shame it isn't that funny.\r It does it's funny moments though. I can say that the movie did get a few laughs from me. The problem is that they are few and far between. The time in between these gags is spent following a pointless plot and watching countless other jokes fall flat on their face thanks to how obvious they are. I got to give the film credit for Kyle Mooney though. He was a consistently funny presence.\r The area where Zoolander 2 disappointed me the most was with it's lack of satire. There are some moments where it pokes fun at hipsters, political correctness, and the except everybody movement, but it's largely lacking in any legit social commentary. Stiller seems to forget what a crucial element that was to the first movie's success.\r Zoolander didn't need a sequel. While not entirely bad, Zoolander 2 certainly proves that. It largely forgets what made it's predecessor so great. As a result it's remarkably less funny. I do appreciate that 2001 sense of humor it so desperately tries to bring back into modern times. However Stiller's need to go bigger in order to hide the lack of quality content prevents that from happening. It's a subpar sequel and comedy. One that isn't even likely to satisfy fans of the original. I know it didn't this one."

      "text": "An unnecessary follow up! Foolander!\r Everything I wrote was just my personal opinion, definitely not intended to offend anybody. Ben Stiller is a good actor, but a fine filmmaker, His directional ventures were awesome, especially after his last film 'Walter Mitty' the expectation was very high on this, but I did not think it'll end like this. It hits the rock bottom, the lowest point in his directional career. His odd film experiment had failed, just for one project and I know he will come back strong. But as an actor, he still got the star value and I'm looking forward for his upcoming project.\r It has been 15 years since the original film and I don't remember much of it. But before this, I had a very quick re-view, so I'm to get a clean flow for a better understanding. Anyway, the film gave a brief report about the past events in the beginning, but when I saw the first face in the opening scene I knew it will going to suck and it did.\r Okay, the first, the story was decent, but not the jokes. And the next, there are too many cameos that kind of ruined its pace to keep quiet for sometime and to focus on actual story development. From all those, the best part and where I actually had a brief laugh was to see Neil deGrasse Tyson. The second films are always very crucial, because it is a bridge between the original film and numerous follow-ups to set up a franchise status. So clearly this film stumbled and I don't think there will be any more films in this series.\r The original 'Zoolander' had its own brand appeal, but with this bad film it got lost. The production was very good and so the performances, but the humours were average. No offense, there are some people who still liked it, but I did not, so I won't recommend it for the 'Zoolander' fans as well as if you're looking for a good comedy. But like I always say who knows you might like it, so think twice in which one is if you're reading this review and the second is analyse it before to decide anything.\r 3/10"

      "text": "The original movie was clearly an overstretched, zany SNL skit...but with a lot of charm. It was a light-hearted, fluffy bit of light relief that was quite clever in its witty take-down of the glitzy celebrity/fashion world. At the centre of this ridiculously glossy ham fest was the dynamite duo of the blonde, hippy-esque, Hansel, and the brunette, Tom Cruise-esque, Derek Zoolander. Both vacant, narcissistic, world famous male models clashing head to head for the grand number one spot in the fashion universe. Oh as a side plot, the evil Mugatu was trying to use Zoolander in order to assassinate a world leader. So what has changed for this belated sequel? well not much frankly. The plot actually follows in the same steps as before with Zoolander once again quitting the modelling world and then once again being forced back into it, this time to gain custody of his son. At the same time, Hansel has done pretty much the same thing and is also dragged back into the modelling world after his orgy partners all turn up pregnant. Both are invited back to 'civilisation' by the mysterious Billy Zane who is apparently still looking for that big break back into Hollywood (just like the original). Oh and Mugatu is still up to his old tricks.\r I think the first thing that hit me was how lame the jokes were, I mean really seriously lame and forced. Within the first ten minutes of the film Billy Zane hands Zoolander his Netflix, 'whoa! Jack Ryan...and Jack Reacher! Tonight's gonna be a total jack-off'. Are you groaning? you must be, surely you must be! Remember now, within the first ten flippin' minutes! Anyway as you can imagine things don't really get any better than that for the rest of the run time. There are barely any moments that did make me actually smile, the main one being the death sequence of Justin Bieber which I'm sure came at the top of most people's list. Another was a quick quip from a news report at the start of the movie, where the reporter speaks about the 3.7 million high school graduates of 2016 not knowing what a fax machine was, and couldn't name a caucasian President.\r The only other oddly amusing things that stood out (stood out in the sense that they were mocking modern society) was Benedict Cumberbatch playing some weird, eyebrow-less, mono-sexual/pan- sexual...model person, who claims not to be confined by binary constructs and has married himself (mono-marriage, is that actually a thing?? really wouldn't surprise me). It was strangely realistic considering today's current trends, as was both Zoolander and Hansel hesitantly agreeing to it all, not liking labels and supporting it all etc...And then you had the character of Don Atari who was pretty much the face of modern youth I guess. You're not suppose to understand half of what he says because he speaks in this modern youth tongue that's kinda like speaking in reverse, whilst taking the p*ss out of everything 'old'. Highly annoying, I know that's the idea but nonetheless, highly annoying.\r The rest of the movie is completely stuffed with one big cameo after another as if you were watching some millionaires fanboy flick (I suppose you are). Zoolander has a son who of course turns out to be fat and ugly, whilst also resenting him for not being a good father. Mugatu once again has some evil, dastardly, Bond-esque scheme to...well I'm not sure really, kill all the leading people in the fashion industry I think it was. This involves kidnapping Zoolander's son under the guise of some ancient prophecy about the fountain of youth in order to lure all the bigwigs of fashion to one place...or whatever. And Hansel...doesn't really do anything except help out here and there or have breakdowns over his pregnant orgy family. Basically Hansel is replaced by Valentina Valencia played by Penelope Cruz in a stereotypically spoof Bond-esque role. Hell everything here is a stereotypical Bond spoof, its basically Austin Powers with loads of cameos.\r Of course the movie isn't supposed to be remotely serious, its virtually a spoof, and in terms of hitting its targets...well I guess it does. The problem is none of this is funny anymore, apart from the odd lone gag its all terribly clich\u00e9d, bloated, self- indulgent and cringeworthy. I mean come on! I've never seen so many cameos, but what for?? they don't add anything to the movie, they don't make it funnier or cooler, they just stick out as, at times, badly crowbarred in cameos. This movie REALLY did feel like a sketch that had been padded out tremendously, the only remaining plus points that spring to mind are the inclusion of Ariana Grande in a latex catsuit and hood, and Milla Jovovich looking hot as hell in her Dominatrix attire. So for mature and adolescent male boner fuel...full marks! For witty social commentary...half marks, everything else..dross."

Apart from that, nothing.\r The Bad: Poor plot. Horrible acting. Sexual jokes make the movie unsuitable for anyone below 12, but those jokes are so inmature that they make the movie too stupid for anyone over 12, so the movie doesn't have a target age. The plot is poor. But what I consider the worst is the horrible developing of the characters: From nonsense accents used along the movie, passing through nonsense, stupid exaggerations, to clothes choosing.\r The ugly: Benedict Cumberbatch character. Seriously, What The F*ck is up with that character!? Also the horrible accents and acting exaggerations. Jesus Christ the actors interpreting the bad guys shout everything they say!\r Verdict: Do yourself a favor: DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE."

      "text": "Zoolander is another example of Hollywood's lack of originality in the past few years so they just polish up some old good movies and make a remake just to make money or pass time. I enjoyed the first one, I really disliked the second one. Bad story, not half as funny as the first one and not even good acting. Some movies are meant not to have sequels and all these movies had sequels in the past few years. Please stop making unwanted sequels and reboots."
