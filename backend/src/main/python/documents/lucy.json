It's like a Matrix wannabe but is tiresome and predicable. Yes there is action but it is all the same and you are just thinking ok I get it get on with it already."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Scarlett Johansson's acting ability is impressive.  Morgan Freeman delivers exposition as beautifully as expected.  The movie was at times fun to watch.  And I'm happy the people writing screenplays are currently fascinated with transcending human limitations through science (although in this case the black market designer drug variety of science).  I wish the people in charge of allocating government research funding in real life were half as fascinated.  Unfortunately that bunch seems more interested in the type of research that makes things (and people) blow up.  Not that this movie didn't have plenty of that.  Not that I mind when it's a movie.  Here ends my praise for Lucy, here begins the snark and spoilers.  Don't say you weren't warned!  The movie starts falling apart around the time drugs turn Lucy's eyes a CGI shade of blue.  Then it manages to recapture my interest during a police standoff in which Lucy meets her ever-after-to-be-bewildered love interest.  But only Robert Heinlein could have created a terser 'boy meets girl, well that's all settled then' sequence.  Immediately after she kisses him so he'll keep following her around like a bewildered collie dog, a car chase ensues.  It lacks all suspense because Lucy is behind the wheel and obviously isn't going to wreck (wreck herself, anyway, she manages to ruin the day and increase car insurance rates for plenty of innocent bystanders).  Here the dialogue really rubs logic the wrong way when Lucy proclaims that no one ever really dies, even as she races with obvious urgency and aforementioned vehicular carnage to extend her own life, apparently in order to share what she has learned with the rest of humanity.  But really, what's the rush, won't it all come around again or something mystically eternal like that?  The movie then collects itself a final time for an ending I found superficially profound.  Until I thought about what the message is in the context of the movie itself.  The plot wraps up with Lucy's voiceover, \u201cLife was given to us a billion years ago. Now you know what you can do with it.\u201d  Okay, who doesn't want to control time and everything else?  (Shut up, yes you do.  You just don't want anyone to think you're a control freak.  You'd jump at the chance.)  But what steps is this movie suggesting we take in order to attain such lofty post-human heights, exactly?  Step 1:  Have a shady boyfriend encourage you to drink lots of alcohol, distract you from your studies, and get you mixed up with ruthless drug dealers before he gets himself killed.  Step 2:  When circumstances permit, arrange to become an unwilling drug mule for the ruthless drug dealers, get groped by one, and make sure he slaps you around a bit so as to accidentally release a lot of designer drugs into your system.  Now you should have some transcendent power flowing through your veins, so move on to Step 3:  With those powers you can straighten everything out (except road safety in France) by first gaining control over yourself, then getting control over other people (shut up, you know you want to make your mother-in-law river-dance on the Thanksgiving Turkey this year), then getting control over pretty much everything, and finally take control over time itself.  At which point you can go directly to Step 4: turn yourself into an organic super computer, then go back in time and have a chat with one of humanity's furry predecessors, or at least lock eyes and touch pointer fingers E.T.-style with one.  But when you return to the present there's still violence, blood, gore, and ignorant humanity, so you pass along what you've learned while your new, cleaner-cut (at least as far as the standards of French police goes) boyfriend kills some guy who was about to shoot you in the back of the head while you were time-surfing.  Proving that you sure didn't change anything with that whole time travel trip.  Which step was that one again?  Sorry, I lost track.  But I guess maybe we can pretend that step made sense because maybe the time-line branched off when Lucy met anthropology Lucy (yes, that Lucy) and in some other branch of time humanity evolved into something much more decent?  Whatever.  On to the Final Step:  Text message your new love interest to let him know you are everywhere.  Very stalkerish.  Don't worry, he won't mind.  In fact, judging by his expression, it seemed to clear some things up for the poor befuddled fellow.  Or at least cheer him up."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Really great Movie with a really Great Plot.\r What's good:\r-People speak their Native language (Korean, Chinese, German, French,...)

Scarlett Johansson in the movie has acted gracefully, beautifully and in the unique expansion as is given to her in her deserving role of superwoman from an indie-film icon and Marvel-universe sidekick, netting unity to the infinity of the concept. Although the concept was a recalcitrant one, the philosophy is the one that says more than the fantastic concept of using your brain to its maximum capacity.

There are some weird, National Geographic or Animal Planet films/cuts placed into the movie, which probably meant something for the mind of the director.

So what she needs is the rest of the drug to boost her brain power to 100 %.\rI am still unsure what her purpose really was. Did she hope to gain the knowledge to save herself or was her aim to gain knowledge for humanity? Who knows. The movie doesn't linger too much on explaining things. Or it isn't made for creatures that only use 12% of their brain capacity..\r A French cop obliges to help her out, while a Japanese drugslord makes matter difficult. It doesn't make much sense. We even get to see a large scale battle between the cops and the gangsters that has the criminals gain the upper hand despite the police being forewarned by Scarlett and thus should have been able to lever the power of the French state against the scum. I would have laughed at this for being silly nonsense, if it wasn't for the fact that nowadays that might even possible. At present the state seems more able to cow their citizens into obedience than stopping terrorists from harming people, which is after all a primary function of the state.\r There isn't much more to say really. Engaging dialog? Nope. Intriguing characters one can identify with? Forget it. A larger than life opponent? Not at all. A deep meaningful exploration of the concept? Ba-boom!  But worst of all. No explanation of the motivation of the characters is given.\r This movie has a script that contains an interesting idea and filled in the remaining blanks with action scenes. Even the action scenes themselves are senseless as they are disconnected. Scarlett's powers change from scene to scene depending on what looks awesome.. At one point the movie becomes pretty awkward because after killing all his minions, Scarlett lets the bad druglord live. The only conceivable reason is that he had to reappear again in the rest of the movie. That is a pretty bad level of writing..\rIt gets a 5 for being meh.\r Oh, it has also Morgan Freeman in it.

It worked.\rThe key is, to see film as art. To take what you can get from it. Not to critizise (and believe me there was a lot of moaning and dis-missing going on in the seats around me) but to make the most of it. Yes you CAN.\rOnce this happens (and there have been a lot of films where it just doesnt happen, let me just say \u2018The Counsellor\u2019) you are free to go and experience that wonderful world of time, intelligence and purpose of life that is Lucy. Maybe I am an optimist who was fed cyborg-bullcrap and went off on it \u2013 maybe I fell in love with the idea of being- and playing Scarlett\u2019s part, but in any case, I am glad to have seen this film, as it let me exit that cinema with sharpened senses and let me glide into the night feeling alive, thursting for knowledge, finding life intelligent and beautiful. Each step was beautiful."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "It's an entertaining movie and interesting idea. Nearing the end when i was expecting a bizarre scene, suddenly just 'poof'. A complete let down at the end, but a happy ending one i guess. It still a good movie to watch on the big screen."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Lucy is a pretty cool action flick with a heavy dose of intelligent writing.   Whether backed by real facts or, assuming, made up ones- it doesn't really matter as the ride is a consistently interesting one that feels like a really juicer primer for a (hoped for) sequel.  Morgan Freeman is solid as the reassuring center to the spinning, frightening reality in which Lucy is thrust."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Great popcorn flick, moves fast, and it \"makes you think\". This material would work even better as a 10-episode tv mini-series with each episode advancing her mental capabilities by 10% and depicting her new abilities. Yeh, that would be righteous."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "The movie starts really good, but to the end it gets just laughable. They shot to long and transformed it into a holy awakening movie towards the end. The superpowers Lucy gets, get more and more ridicolous when she turns smarter and stronger. SPOILER : Why should a human be able to use telekinesis and travel in time because they got 10x smarter than before ? SPOILER END. They should have stopped in the middle of the film and just go on with the plot from there, but the movie transforms to a comedy from there..."}], "recommendations": ["elysium", "limitless", "colossal", "sunshine", "annihilation", "chaos_walking", "the_tomorrow_war", "arrival", "surrogates", "chappie", "source_code", "what_happened_to_monday", "interstellar", "code_8", "captive_state", "repo_men", "downsizing", "nerve", "jupiter_ascending", "guns_akimbo", "anon", "children_of_men", "mortal_engines", "they_live", "the_girl_with_all_the_gifts"]}
