Patrick Wilson, Kurt Russell, Richard Jenkins, and Matthew Fox, are all great in this one and really have chemistry as a group. The mysterious savages who are causing havoc on their town and on the frontier as a whole are a truly terrifying group and really have no problems making you entirely terrified of them. The film is also really well shot and has a good score that fits both the western and horror genres. My main problem here is the graphic and, really, unnecessary violence. The film is very good, but gets hampered by its apparent willingness to make its audience violently ill. There is truly no call for that and I should not have to see what this film put me through. As an overall picture, however, Bone Tomahawk is a very well executed film that really blends horrors and westerns quite well, while also managing to be endlessly captivating."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "A film I was really looking forward to that ended up disappointing for reasons I didn't quite expect. One of the things I've always heard about writer/director S. Craig Zahler's films is that they're always impeccably written, with a lot of the character and plotting work feeling as authentic as possible. This couldn't be more true in \"Bone Tomahawk's\" case. The characters all feel as textured and as fleshed out as can be, featuring specific quirks, worldviews, and ways of speaking that really help add to the overall sense of realism in the film. Also operating on the keyword \"realism\" is the narrative, which unfurls itself at a pace and fashion that's cautious, but also exhilaratingly unpredictable. So where do things go wrong for me? Well, this is a very unique film in terms of style. Surprisingly so, in fact. There's little to no score, a mostly refreshing lack of standard editing and blocking techniques, and very little actual goings-on until the climactic final act. This hyperrealistic flavor of cinematic filmmaking really makes the scenes where things are transpiring feel utterly thrilling and unpredictable, with the deemphasis of music and traditional editing techniques really putting you in a unique place as an audience member. But, again, once that's coupled with the tremendous amount of downtime and traveling scenes we have to witness, this sort of style can make for some rather potent spells of sluggishness. It's a completely legitimate and even momentarily brilliant first effort, but I'm more excited to see how this filmmaker grows from this admittedly imperfect experience."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "The movie is slow at the beginning but the acting and the interesting story drag you back in the movie every time.

With the combination of fine cinematography, this is perhaps just as, if not more beautiful than the competing fine Western of 2015, Slow West. Russell, Wilson, and Fox perform to the best of their abilities with Jenkins delivering what may be the best work in his career. The four named actors carry this story on horseback and foot, not for a moment letting their grip fail. Other performances, namely those of Simmons and whomever played the god-awful accomplice to the opening scene, fail to match the work done by their surrounding party. However, it's not so terrible that it hinders the film. Actually, the opening scene was quite hindered by the actor whom I care not to discover. Anyhow, the overall professional work is just that, top-notch and quite obviously professional. For these reasons I can confidently name Bone Tomahawk an extraordinary film.\r However, it is my only complaint (though I accept that I am simply not the target audience of such a genre) that the violence is overly indulged. Being a medic for the United States military, I have seen enough gruesome detail to find entertainment in the excessive depiction. The brutality is mixed well in the execution of  the overall product, but I find such torture porn to be deemed of a lesser class professionally. You can get the darkest and most brutal of points across without depicting every detail. I know there are many opposing opinions on the matter, so such is just that: my opinion.\r It is nonetheless an excellent work of film and an exciting story.

I'm sure that fans of westerns will certainly find some enjoyment in Bone Tomahawk."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Bone Tomahawk stars the second-rate ensemble cast of Kurt Russell, Patrick Wilson, David Arquette, Matthew Fox, Richard Jenkins, and Sid Haig.  Although these actors are a step below big names, they play their roles in stellar fashion, and elevate themselves to first-rate levels.  Kurt Russell and the unrecognisable Richard Jenkins are an absolute treat to watch, and their on-screen chemistry is fantastic.  Patrick Wilson gives the role justice and keeps pace with the veterans on set.  Matthew Fox was a good casting decision, and it was nice to see Matthew on screen again.\r The dialogue is a gem in this film.  Everything these characters say is like candy to the ears.  The southern-drawl, and overly-polite nature of their conversations - even when in dire situations - is hands-down the most pleasant I've experienced in a film this year.\r Benji Bakshi's cinematography is creative and intriguing.  Combined with S. Craig Zahler's direction, the lingering shot composition adds tension in almost every scene.  It is clear Benji took time and care to add depth and meaning to each individual shot in this film, and by doing so, he garners a specificity for displaying the constriction of the characters and the motifs of the plot.\r The plot in itself is engaging from the beginning.  The mystery surrounding the circumstances pulls you in as you are soon thrust into a situation in which the characters actions reflect the audiences conjecture.  This film is book-ended, opening with a desecration and closing with a reluctant respect.  On the surface, the film portrays the antagonists as savages, which they are, but underneath Zahler commands us to understand that we are the ones disturbing their land.  None of this is explicitly stated, like perhaps if this film were released with a larger budget, and more production backing it - which is the beauty of the deliverance of this film's message: inference.\r Filmed in two weeks, I can definitely say this film deserves a wider audience and more attention.\r My official rating is 76/100, but because of the restriction of user reviewers, Metacritic only allows 1-10, so I round up."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Just a bang average western.

Well this one was and it falls a long way short of superlative, are file reviewers a waste of space? A lot of negative reviews are the result of one actor being chopped in half in one scene, frankly I think that is gross over reaction by the prudish puritan fraternity and really has no bearing on the film in its entirety.The film falls down in my opinion because it is so jarring in it's presentation of the wild west, it is set somewhere around 1870. What is jarring is that the director has managed to insert so much 2015 in circa 1870.The opening scene of 2 deadbeats, with audio only you wold swear they had a 21st century education, being able to discuss how many veins in a person's neck was not common knowledge, I'd be prepared to wager, back in 1870, even in 2019 probably only some doctors could answer that.  Shortly after the opening scene we have a shot of the village announcement board, announcing the village name and population of around 250. It looked like a 21st century tourist trap, I thought then that the movie was a spoof. Then we move into the house of one of the main actors, at first you think it's a dump, old unpainted floor boards with a one inch gap between each one and then you see the above floor furnishings which could have been taken from Vouge magazine.And in this bustling of around 250 people we have 2 doctors and people prancing around dressed like they are headed for the Oscars. It is so out of place that it just jars you. People, in 1870, who lived in villages with a population of 250 would have maybe a general store and that's it. But wait, this town has a sheriff and 2 deputies, more than 10% of the entire population.One bloke has a leg injury which is very opaque, I am never sure whether it is broken or just lacerated but he can walk for days on end with a crutch. It is very silly and unrealistic. They decide to travel at night and somehow manage to navigate to where they want to go, I particularly liked using a telescope in the dead of night - really gave me a sense these guys knew what they were doing.So we are back to familiar territory, people being in places and doing things that could not exist or are just not possible."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "The sheer fact that this movie exists in 2015 is more horrifying than anything in the movie, and I just watched a man eat his own scalp and get ripped in half."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Honestly, I didn't understand why the movie's rating is so shamelessly high.

Maybe the casting is not so bad, maybe even acting isn't so awful, maybe the general idea is also rather promising. But...\r But somehow it happened that what we have in the issue is a complete fail. Why? It's inconsistent, improbable, childish, naive, impostrous and silly.

It's ham-fisted.\rWas he trying for a weird mix of these two things? ...probably, but that isn't what jars me.\r What jars me is that every element in the movie is a mix of sometimes good, sometimes competently shrug-able, and sometimes incompetent. I will say that the lighting is generally good (with some conspicuously forced lighting here and there), and that the flat characterization is acceptable in a film of this genre.\r BUT, the story logic, the dialogue, the acting, the shot/edit/sequence decisions, the sound design-- they're often sub-par or terrible. If these were all good to great, the weird tone of the picture wouldn't\rbother me.

The 10\ror so people I've asked about Bone Tomahawk had never heard of it and\rthat lack of awareness, due to little or no promotion, is an\runfortunate by-product of the film's independent nature (it cost less\rthan $2 million to make). Kurt Russell, the film's star, turns in a\rfirst-rate performance as Frank Hunt, the sheriff of a frontier town in\rthe American West in the 1800's. Russell hasn't acted much since\rstarring in Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof in 2007 and it's nice to\rsee him back in 2015 with some high profile and meaty roles (this\rsummer's Furious 7 and Tarantino's about-to-be-released The Hateful\rEight). Here, he's surrounded by a talented cast that includes Patrick\rWilson (Watchmen and the current season of TV's Fargo), Richard Jenkins\r(The Visitor and TV's Six Feet Under), and Matthew Fox (TV's Lost),\rwith additional support from David Arquette, Lili Simmons, and Sean\rYoung.\r First-time director S. Craig Zahler also wrote the character-driven\rscreenplay, which Russell called \"the best Western I've read since\rTombstone\". I was rather surprised to learn that 1993's Tombstone was\rthe last western Russell had appeared in, considering how memorable he\rwas in it as Wyatt Earp and how comfortable he seems in the genre\r(apparently he's making up for lost time - The Hateful Eight is also a\rWestern). The gruff Hunt, sporting a lite version of the full-on\rYosemite Sam-style facial hair Russell displays in Tarantino's upcoming\rfilm, heads up a four-man posse who represent the only hope for some\rlocals kidnapped by a tribe of cannibalistic cave-dwellers. Also\rincluded in the foursome are Jenkins' bumbling deputy (the film's go-to\rsource for comic relief), Fox's dandyish gunslinger, and Wilson as the\rbroken-legged distraught husband of one of the kidnapped townsfolk. The\rphysical limitations of Wilson's character impede the urgent nature of\rthe group's quest, who need to make a five day journey in three days.\rThat conveniently helps to extend the time available for the interplay\rbetween the four radically different characters and it's those lively\rexchanges that are Bone Tomahawk's core strength.

This film is great and is a memorable horror movie for the bleak and bloody events that transpire."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Great characters, setting and acting. A welcome change to both the western and horror drama"}, {"rating": "4", "text": "After a thoroughly exciting beginning, the film drags and becomes extremely tough and boring to watch."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "A movie with a difference in that it combines strong horror elements with a traditional western story. And it works well."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I loved the mashing of the western and horror genres. It resists the temptation to just be gore-porn; and the horror elements are sprinkled in sparingly and tastefully. The main cast is fantastic, especially Kurt Russell; and the cinematography, costume design etc is excellent. This is the kind of film where you just have to let the atmosphere and the journey wash over you. It's surprisingly light in action, but heavy on atmosphere and characters."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "One of the better western movies I've seen and it's not afraid to show the brutal nature of colonial settler life. Solid performances by all the actors involved, you almost get lulled into a false sense of security by their grit and proficiency until the last 30 minutes or so."}], "recommendations": ["the_harder_they_fall", "blackhat", "the_magnificent_seven", "cube", "the_fly", "body_of_lies", "upgrade", "blade_of_the_47_ronin", "drive", "the_equalizer_2", "color_out_of_space", "bad_times_at_the_el_royale", "us", "the_invasion", "eastern_promises", "a_most_violent_year", "reminiscence", "no_sudden_move", "a_walk_among_the_tombstones", "they_live", "django_unchained", "the_terminator", "hell_or_high_water", "indiana_jones_and_the_temple_of_doom", "moon"]}
