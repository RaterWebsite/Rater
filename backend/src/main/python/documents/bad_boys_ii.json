Its just a great action-comedy where Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are again in top form as Mike Lawrie and Marcus Barnett. In terms of entertainment this is  non-stop action set at a fantastic pace. The story again focuses upon the Miami drug scene with a new villain in Johnny Tapia the kingpin, set in motion Mike and Marcus to bring him down but what follows isn't just sheer entertainment its sex, violence and genuine laughter! Smith and Lawrence are awesome together. Bad Boys 2 is an instant classic which exceeds the original. Bring on Bad Boys 3!!!"

      "text": "It's easy to tell when you're watching a Michael Bay movie, particularly from post-90s Bay. He is a straight-up action junkie, and \"Bad Boys II\" is perhaps as much of an action flick as you could get, flying from one scene to the next in a visually pompous, grandiose and sometimes distracting style. Bay's lack of proof at delivering good acting is saved to a certain extent here by the always-enjoyable Will Smith and sometimes-enjoyable Martin Lawrence, and the plot is - as usual - written to serve action and visual interest rather than characters and compelling suspense. Also signature of Bay here is a well-rounded melting pot of pubescence and common denominators - the screen is bursting at the seams virtually every minute with frenetic car chases and gunfights, bloody shootings, pissed off characters in love with profanity and the camera's adolescent adoration for sexual imagery and innuendo. Hell, in this round Bay treats himself to a substantial amount of somewhat disturbing mortuary humor and cadaver carnage, even resorting to throwing fat dead bodies off the back of a truck and watching them subsequently squashed and mutilated by traffic.\r Still, despite all the over-the-line black comedy and lack of any substantive character development or plotwriting, the action scenes are mostly a lot of fun, and it's still nice to see car chases and massive destruction that isn't just CGI. True, you do have some computer cars swerving and tumbling down highways in a mayhem that likely defies many laws of physics, but you also have a Hummer careening madly down a hill of shacks and houses, followed by trails of explosions and enemy gunfire. Even when led by Will Smith, this can never make for great filmmaking, but this is Michael Bay at his adolescent best, and in this movie he can be largely forgiven for his momentary transgressions due to the overall popcorn factor of the flick. Just be warned - if you don't have the stomach for brutal bloody violence, hundreds of F-words, or hiding under sheets with dead big-breasted cadavers, \"Bad Boys II\" will not be your cup of tea. If you don't mind a barrage of mindless teenage eye candy, then perhaps you'll find this a treat. For me, I give it a rating straight down the middle. Fun action, some funny moments, and nice special effects, but stuffed with meatless filler of a plot. Okay, but not that great."

      "text": "Just when you think a Michael Bay film can't get any crazier he reunites Will Smith and Martin Lawrence to have a shootout with the KKK, turn Miami into an all-out war zone (twice!) complete with civilian casualties, get in a car chase where Haitians throw a boat at them, watch rats have sex, run over some cadavers in the street, ogle a dead lady's **** and invade Cuba. Bad Boys II is a nasty, gory, offensive ride along with two homicidal cops that don't experience even a hint of remorse for all the death and destruction that they cause and I loved every second of it.After watching this it's easy to see why so many have such strong opinions about Michael Bay. Not just as a filmmaker, but as a person. You truly have to be a little sick in the head to come up with stuff this disgusting and mean-spirited. Yet, it's hard to deny his talent as a director. You may not like what he's putting onscreen, but he's placing it there with skill. The action looks absolutely spectacular even if it takes police brutality to a whole new level and things are much funnier this time around. The duo's ability to remain completely unfazed and uncaring no matter what dangerous or disgusting situation they're in is darkly hilarious, and their antagonistic banter now has the cleverness to match the crudity.Bad Boys II is the adolescent shoot 'em up fantasy version of police work dialed up to 11. It's all insane action, wildly inappropriate antics, and incessant bickering from start to finish. Bay crosses the line of good taste on multiple occasions, but he executes his vision with such gleeful enthusiasm that I couldn't help but have an absolute blast. 9.3/10"

I don't even remember the noisy first movie, I just didn't like it that much, even though it has higher ratings. Bad Boys II completely changes the game by throwing in more drugs, sex and stupendously bloody violence, and boy was it entertaining. Michael Bay is one of the most disliked directors, okay, but with BB2 he totally has realized a new genre of action thrillers on their own, for example- the car chases are the most best chases I have ever seen in a movie. He blends Lethal Weapon and Boyz In Da Hood and Pineapple Express together, and experiments with his movie elements. The result is a lush Miami setting, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence at their comedic best, a drug fulled story, car and gun chases, and sgexy women. What more could you want from an action movie. It's not a movie for serious critics or people who don't like action movies. BB2 is a hidden classic action flick, it's well paced, smartly written and brilliantly acted. The appeal is beautiful. And it still technically holds up in 2015. I hope the third one is good! The nose fun you will have watching a movie, period."

Compared to \"Bad Boys,\" \"Bad Boys II\" is greatly improved from an action and kinetics standpoint, with the set pieces cumulatively comprising the film's greatest attribute in my opinion. I personally relished in that of the car carrier trailer/Ferrari chase, a scene that some have complained is too long. Honestly, though, it could have been much longer, so as to keep me further away from the scarcely funny humor and piss poor domestic spats sprinkled amidst the film's runtime. The villains are over the top, the feasibility of everything is rightfully lampoonable and there's a whole host of material that doesn't age well. In short, it's typical, early 2000's Bay, but I'd be a fool for not admitting that it could be a whole lot worse."

      "text": "Whether the original Bad Boys merited a sequel is a moot point - with worldwide takings of over $180 million on a $23 million budget, it was inevitable.\r However, a gap of eight years - an age in cinematic terms - means that the hardly indelible characters have fallen off the movie-going radar and need to make quite a noise to recapture an audience now more enamoured with CG, kung fu and fantasy than bullets and fireballs. While not wanting for bangs, as a film Bad Boys II makes more of a dull thud.\r Smith and Lawrence are an agreeable comic pairing when given the right material and a reason for their incessant bickering - otherwise their sniping is irritating rather than hilarious.\r The 'killer ecstasy' plot (which causes precisely one fatality and seems to do very nicely for Lawrence in one jarring comedy sequence) on which their antics are hung might have passed muster in the '80s, but seems a little 'so what?' now - like warning against the perils of CFCs.\r The pair do have their moments (especially an amusing interrogation of Marcus' daughter's terrified date), but much of what's here is offensive (corpse tossing, anyone?) without being funny.\r Smith in particular, though a master of the buddy comedy genre, could do with being pickier with his material, having starred in nothing consistently hilarious since the original Men In Black.\r Even in the face of leaden material, Michael Bay still manages to pull some impressive directorial tricks out of the bag. The first car chase down a Miami highway beats the overloaded freeway free-for-all of The Matrix Reloaded hands down, and his use of the camera is occasionally dazzling. But for what?\r Circling a shootout in one continuous tracking shot looks jaw-dropping, but when the villains have no apparent motive or relevance, you might as well watch it with the sound off.\r By the time the film hits the two-hour mark, with a needless trip to Cuba and yet another car chase/shoot out, what was once invention has long since dulled into pointless repetition.\r There\u0092s some \u0091bad\u0092, meaning good, here; there\u0092s also a lot of plain bad. Frankly, there\u0092s just far too much of everything."

      "text": "That beeping sound you hear just before Bad Boys II starts isn't some technical hitch. It's the dumper truck, driven by producer Jerry Bruckheimer, backing up to Michael Bay's desk and unloading the Gross National Product of Slovakia. Clearly, director Bay pocketed the cash, dashed straight past Decent Scriptwriting Inc and headed directly into Explosions R Us. The money's all up there on the screen, only most of it soon flies off in a shower of flame and rubble.\r Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) are chasing down a drug dealer who's smuggling his ecstasy into the country via a mortuary. While investigating (read: killing henchmen in a series of ultra-destructive car chases), the pair discover that Marcus' sexy sis Syd (Gabrielle Union) is working undercover for their quarry. Tricky situation - made doubly so by the fact that Syd's shagging Mike behind her over-protective brother's back.\r All of which is really just an excuse for the titular cops to shoot guns, trade insults and frustrate their boss (Joe Pantoliano). Fine. Or it would be if all the action bolted onto this wobbly narrative frame didn't come straight from the school of lazy sequels. You know, the one with diplomas marked More Of The Same. Yes, there are some breath-snatching stunts on show here, from the Matrix-matching highway chase (Smith and Lawrence's speeding auto dodging cars thrown from a transporter truck) to the delirious 360-degree pan around a frantic shoot-out. They'll thrill, but they won't solve the movie's biggest problem - director overload.\r No doubting that Bay knows how to graft together a set-piece. It's just that once he finds something he likes, he won't let go. So be prepared to sit through another highway chase, almost identical but with spilled corpses replacing spilled cars. And, despite Bay's protestations that Pearl Harbor signalled his move into more substantive filmmaking, here he's reset his targets to match those he was aiming at almost a decade ago. One or two startling CG shots aside, Boys II could have been made eight months after the first movie, let alone eight years. And it's not just the explosions, either - even the ecstasy-smuggling plot and Lawrence's New Age obsession feels faintly stale.\r Still, one vital component is all the better for not having moved: the wisecracks. Okay, so some of the boys' quick-fire banter is worryingly homophobic, adding to the discomfort of the almost orgiastic violence, but it's the pair's ceaseless gaggery that raises the watchability. Teamed with Big Willie, even Martin soddin' Lawrence is funny.\r Bad Boys II does not reinvent the action film. It repeats it. But if you came out of the original wanting an extra two hours, step up and have a blast. Just don't expect to have quite as much fun as Michael Bay did when he made it...\r Michael Bay turns off the brain and switches on the detonator... Overlong, overblown and underwritten it may be, but Bad Boys II still punches the pleasure centres enough to qualify as big, dumb fun. Just."

      "text": "Hot Cars, Burning Rubber and Guys Good and Bad!\r Let's begin with a traffic report. This has been an unusually chaotic summer on the freeways and boulevards of South Florida and Southern California \u2014 in the movies anyway. First there were Laurence Fishburne and Keanu Reeves somersaulting on top of a speeding semi in \"The Matrix Reloaded\" to the sound of grinding gears and complaining metal. This was followed in short order by the big chase at the end of \"Hollywood Homicide,\" the Mitsubishi mating dance in \"2 Fast 2 Furious\" and Arnold Schwarzenegger swinging from the end of a giant crane in \"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.\"\r Now, hoping to outdo them all in automotive wreckage and box office damage, here is \"Bad Boys II,\" in which a posse of bad guys commandeers a trailer loaded with new cars that they drive at high speed along a stretch of Miami highway, flinging the cargo onto the road behind them at Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, who are in furious pursuit. \"Did you see that?\" Mr. Lawrence exclaims as a Buick spirals overhead. To which Mr. Smith replies: \"They're throwing cars. How am I not going to see that?\"\r Later a different set of bad guys (not to be confused with the bad boys of the title, Mr. Smith and Mr. Lawrence, who are good guys) will do a similar trick, only with embalmed corpses, one of which is graphically decapitated by another vehicle. But perhaps it is time to cut away from the chase.\r \"Bad Boys II,\" in which Mr. Smith and Mr. Lawrence once again play a pair of Miami police detectives named Mike and Marcus, is the latest collaboration between Jerry Bruckheimer, who produced it, and Michael Bay, who directed. (Ron Shelton, director of the much better \"Hollywood Homicide,\" helped write the screenplay.) This one follows in the tradition of the earlier Bruckheimer-Bay pictures \u2014 the first \"Bad Boys,\" \"The Rock,\" \"Armageddon\" and \"Pearl Harbor\" \u2014 all of which made a lot of money and were otherwise pretty much worthless.\r Mr. Bruckheimer, who is routinely identified in publicity material as \"the most successful producer of all time,\" is not a man for subtlety or for half measures. This summer he has, at least momentarily, outdone himself, releasing two movies \u2014 \"Bad Boys II\" and \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" \u2014 within 10 days. The two films have an aggregate running time just shy of five hours. (\"Boys,\" at 144 minutes, is 11 minutes longer than \"Pirates.\") Anyone contemplating a double feature should come prepared with a large bottle of Tylenol. I can't say I recommend the experience, but it's your money, at least until Mr. Bruckheimer gets his hands on it.\r Quite a bit was clearly spent on the assaultive, bombastic, and occasionally funny spectacle that is \"Bad Boys II.\" Mr. Bay may lack restraint (also taste, wit and shame), but he does have an undeniable flair for sleaze, noise and vulgarity. One of his most impressive feats is to film a nightclub rave scene so that the camera glides under the skirts and between the legs of the women. There is something leering and nasty about this that makes the more pervasive ogling in \"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle\" seem downright wholesome.\r A similarly cold, aggressive voyeurism characterizes the film's violence, which is relentless and often gruesome. Corpses are probed for drugs hidden inside them; a bucket of severed limbs, still dripping blood, is placed on a dining-room table. Several times Mr. Bay uses slow motion to track the course of a speeding bullet, climaxing with its explosive, splattery impact on a human body. David O. Russell used a similar effect in \"Three Kings\" as a graphic and terrifying illustration of what a gunshot can do. Here it is meant to produce a dumb, visceral, involuntary thrill. The audience at the screening I attended responded on cue to each exploding cranium and mangled tosro, with oohs and oofs and wows (as well as less printable interjections), and so, helplessly, did I.\r The cast, in contrast, appear fit and energetic. The best moments come when Mr. Smith and Mr. Lawrence are permitted to pause from their action-hero duties and run their funny, unpredictable mouths. At one point, to no discernible narrative purpose, they team up to terrify a young man who has come to take Marcus's daughter on a date, and their parody of thuggish bravado seems like a sly sendup of the movie itself.\r The main difference between the partners is that Marcus is a family man (his infinitely patient wife is played, in too few scenes, by Teresa Randle), while Mike is, in his partner's words, \"a dog.\" He also happens to be sweet on Marcus's younger sister, Syd (Gabrielle Union), an undercover federal agent who is mixed up in their case, and whose abduction by the chief bad guy occasions the unauthorized invasion of Cuba at the end of the movie."
