  "description": "As a new day begins in the town of Silverton, its residents have little reason to believe it will be anything other than ordinary. Mother Nature, however has other plans. In the span of just a few hours, an unprecedented onslaught of powerful tornadoes ravages Silverton. Storm trackers predict that the worst is still to come, as terrified residents seek shelter, and professional storm-chasers run toward the danger, hoping to study the phenomenon close up and get a once-in-a-lifetime shot.",

It has flat characters that show no development, clich\u00e9 after clich\u00e9, and a boring script. But who cares? That's not what this movie is about. It's about destruction, thrills, and good CGI, all of which it delivers on."

The effects and damage looks amazing the tornados are frightening and the \"big one\" is unbelievably jaw dropping! Also the movie has a few funny moments with Nathan Kress (icarly) being a funny like able character as well as the redneck dynamic duo who offer a few laughs as well. Overall I liked the characters but the main reason to see this movie is the special effects and destruction this movie has. These tornados are killers and they destroy everything from planes, oil tankers, schools and of course houses and cities. This movie has the best looking tornados I've ever seen! They are terrifyingly real looking! Overall I loved this movie it's a great summer blockbuster and the best disaster film since \"day after tomorrow and twister!\" So If your a fan of disaster movies or wanna see tornados destroy everything in their path you should definitely check it out.  9/10"

The story is about as trite as a disaster plot could be, but it's so poorly written that there's no sympathy for the family and the TV crew. I lost count of how many times somebody screamed \"Hold on!\" However, the tornado effects are FANTASTIC. Special effects have gotten to the point where it's a completely convincing spectacle. That's the only reason to go. If you can ignore the irrational moments (a large airport in a rural town is just one) you'll be in for several whirlwinds of massive destruction."

You've got the high-school guy finally getting up the courage to talk to the girl he likes, the brothers with daddy issues, and a team of tornado chasers who haven't seen a tornado in a long time.\r The film tries to get us to like and care about these characters before the chaos starts, but it isn't until the tornadoes show up that things get interesting. The tornadoes look amazing and so does the insane destruction they cause. It really is a treat for the eyes and honestly it's hard to believe that what you're seeing isn't real at times.\r It's amazing and kept me on the edge of my seat. It feels like you're watching an apocalypse movie, and a really good one at that. It tries hard to stir up some emotions amongst the storm, but mostly falls short. These characters aren't bad, but the tornadoes are the real stars here. Still it is entertaining to watch them try and survive.\r \"Into the Storm\" packs some insane thrills. Unbelievably great looking sights are brought to life by some of the best CGI I've ever seen. Seriously it puts the works of Peter Jackson to shame in this category. Overall it is definitely worth the watch and will provide for one awesome movie night."

      "text": "Into the Storm was a very surprising movie for many reasons. The first surprise is that Max Deacon, who plays one of the main characters named Donnie, carries the film from an acting perspective. Sarah Wayne Callies was marketed as the big get but Max Deacon steals the show. The second surprise was how well the special effects were, especially considering the relatively modest $50 million budget. Also, the shorter duration of 89 minutes didn't prevent Steven Quale from delivering plenty of character development. Actually, I'd say the shorter time helped the movie as it was able to dive into the action fairly quickly and make for almost a beginning to end, edge-of-your-seat tornado thriller. Lastly, and maybe the biggest surprise of all, the movie was very funny. Jon Reep and Kyle Davis, playing stereotypical rednecks named Reevis and Donk, respectively, added a great deal of comedic relief and the timing for their wacky humor was perfect and contrasted with the devastation of the town around them well. There were still some flaws. There was a void of anything scientific whatsoever, which is something that Twister, a film that all tornado movies are compared against, at least attempted. There also was a missed opportunity on some of the emotion. I thought this last bit could've made the movie leap from exciting and somewhat terrifying nature environmental thriller to deep and insightful catastrophe movie. A leap almost all of the movies in this genre seem to fail at achieving. Nonetheless, I felt that it was more than worth my time."

      "text": "Deceptively looking as if it's a straight to DVD B-movie, Into the Storm is actually a fairly good disaster movie with decent acting and effect. The buildup takes quite a while as it switches back and forth between into mockumentary and usual catastrophic shot. It is a different kind of style that tries to establish more authenticity, which to its credit, work adequately in some scenes. Upon first glance it highly resembles Twister, though effort has been made to avoid such resemblance, and it still treads the line between absurdity and timely coincidence, but surprisingly the movie entertains well enough to breathe some fresh air to audience.\r Frankly speaking, the most notable actors in the movie are Richard Armitage (Thorin from The Hobbit) as Gary and Sarah Wayne Callies (Lori from Walking Dead) as Allison. They fit their roles which are both single parents accidentally trapped in a dire situation, Armitage in particular looks believably parental. While a bit hard to discern without costume and beard, he's strikingly a bit like Jeremy Renner here, his echoing voice might be familiar to some. The movie delivers more in acting department with some good scenes, while its characters are pretty likeable and easy to sympathize with.\r It's not a slouch on special effect either, although most movies these days possess some degree of blockbuster effect. Into the Storm is at its best when the disaster happens in first person or documentary style, since these types of spectacles usually provide typical grandiose crash and mayhem. While it's not a big budget or metropolis level carnage, the movie produces the scenes effectively. However, it still confusingly drags a couple of dumb countryside show-offs who miraculously stick in the movie for Youtube fame, a missed comical attempt there. Some law of physics and remarkably timing are seen as well to get the plot going, albeit they are the somewhat expected and understandable.\r Despite some setbacks and its moderate production value, it brings enough to warrant a decent disaster movie."

They should have just stuck to stuff being sucked up and blown around.\rI'd definitely not recommend this, nor would I buy the DVD.

They made all the same mistakes they made in Twister, but in some cases even more egregious. They totally ripped off Sean Casey and his TIV to the point where I'm shocked there wasn't legal action. Sure, the CGI in the tornadoes was miles better than Twister but the story and acting, if anything, was worse. And, once again, we have twisters appearing out of thin air at the bottom of stratus clouds and radar readings that show just nondescript cluster storms, moving in the WRONG DIRECTION. Their storms were heading SOUTHWEST in their screens. It wouldn't have taken much to get it right with the right consulting. The only storm that looked almost right was the first one and it looked as thought they ripped off the footage from a copter cam of a storm a few years ago. Honestly, Sharknado Two was better, at least that one knew it was low-rate and played on it. Still, glad I went to see it. The best part were the yahoos. I won't say more."

Sounds like I\u2019m taking the piss but I\u2019m actually serious, Into The Storm made me cringe in the previews and I begged for its big scale disaster and it delivered on every level. The special effects are so catacalysmically astounding, I don\u2019t understand how the movie bombed at the box office\u2026I mean audiences bought horrific acting and story in Transformers 4\u2026and 3\u2026.and 2\u2026.and to some extent 1\u2026and teenage mutant ninja turtles\u2026and battleship\u2026but still you walk into this movie knowing 100% that the acting is going to be average, the story is going to suck and barely be there, we are here for big screen twisters with an alarmingly high level of destruction and boy did this deliver!\r So the plot inverted commas is based around a couple of different groups of people, a couple of redneck goofballs who spend the movie filming crazy stunts to try and get famous on youtube, a group of film students trying to record a college essay video, a group of storm chasers filming a documentary and an entire graduating class. Together their stories intertwine as they try to stay out of fire from the tornados (and yes I say tornados!) as well as flying cars, planes, trucks, wreckage and houses that are tossed around in an epic CGI impress-fest. This movie suffers with its story but makes up for it with groundbreaking CGI work that looks so real you would almost believe it.\r he special effects are so masterfully detailed it makes it so hard to criticize this film, it is littered with tornados, including the dreaded firenado, the whole CG looks so real it actually provides a real sense of danger and fear that Twister seemed to really miss.\r Now cast wise there are a couple of big names in here Richard Armitage from The Hobbit films, Sarah Wayne Callies from The Walking Dead and Scott Lawrence from Avatar and Star Trek Into Darkness are the standouts for this, the rest are a bunch of fresh faces that don\u2019t provide anything substancial to the role, but given what limited material they are given, it is hardly surprising. Sure its full of characters doing dumb things like running into abandoned factories full of hazardous chemicals and running into the school for shelter and hiding in the hallways and then saying that the school has a storm shelter later on after the tornado has passed, but for all of its misgivings this movie is just pure fun.\r Critics have been panning this movie as the worst thing since Transformers 4, but if you simply walk in, switch your brain off and relax, you will find that this 90 minute piece of escapism is a lot of fun and is a great example of how special effects have come."

Only one main character dies, and you could tell throughout the whole movie that he had it coming to him. For how bad this movie was, I do have to give credit where credit is due. The special effect was cool to watch. The tornado at the end looked amazing. The effects are to only thing keeping me from giving this movie a 2/10. Should you see this move?

      "text": "Many people say that Into The Storm was too much like Twister, but that is only partially correct. Twister was the story of storm chasers, trying to beat another team to the punch in getting data from inside a tornado. Into The Storm also has storm chasers, but they're only a part of the story, as it also features the town caught in a super storm, and a family caught in the middle. If you want to compare this film to twister, simply because of tornadoes and storm chasers you can, but Into The Storm still wins, as it features a better background story, better special effects, and is overall much more intense. Richard Armitage stars as the High School's assistant principle, that goes into the storm to find his missing son, and save other people in the path. While the British Actor isn't known for anything more than The Hobbit, he showed real intensity and fortitude, making the film so much more exciting. He's paired with storm chaser turned rescuer, Sarah Wayne Callies, best known for her roles in Prison Break and The Walking Dead. Callies usual plays the strong female character with great ideas, the leaders right hand if you will. In this film however she is little more than a follower, leading to a performance that wasn't nearly as good as I thought it would be. When you have a film with the popularity of Twister, anything else that features anything even remotely similar is going to be compared to that film and ultimately called a rip off, and parts of it could be considered that. When watching the film and now reflecting on it, I prefer to think of it as updating a great idea with a new cast, story, and effects. You are free to disagree and if you're one of those people who think of it as just another rip off, I'd still recommend seeing it for the special effects, if nothing else."

I can call it a display for commercial purpose than reality, that's what Hollywood is famous for, isn't it?\r The fun part was, the tornado(es) behaved like it had a soul and conscious like any living organism. 'Final Destination 5' was one of the best digital 3D movie at that time, when it comes to the awesome pop-ups and very disappointed with this film which was crafted by the same director.\r The plus point was, it mildly entertains with a merely good pace of narration. Definitely it is not a category-A movie, if you want, you can say it because of the actors. The real reason is the performances from the cast was not noticeable. If one, one person had a strong hold up on his role the movie might had clinched its success. Due to CGI rule, actors are not getting a better scope for their characters. That's very sad, but true.

Adem\u00e1s, a pesar de que a veces tiende a volverse en algunos momentos algo tonta, evoca su trama de tornados en puntos de una fuerte acci\u00f3n que pueden llegar a sentir al espectador sorprendido, con suspenso y con nervios de que pasar\u00e1."

      "text": "The first 30 minutes of this movie was very boring it is trying to set everything up and introduce you to characters that you never really care much about at all during the whole movie. Once the tornado scenes started the movie finally started to pick up. Even then when it was not a tornado scene the movie was still boring. But I can say that the scenes during the storm/ tornado scenes they were really good. The effects of the tornados were really well done and did look life like to me. I am a fan of natural disaster movies this is not one of the best but the effects are really cool at parts."

Dunno what the problem is with some people giving it a bad review!!!!!!!! It's one of those films you know you are going to enjoy watching again at a later date. I actually found it very original. Just because it's in the genre of disaster movie does not make it boring at all."
