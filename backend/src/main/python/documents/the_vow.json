      "text": "I realize that this was based on a true story, but that still does not excuse what can only be described as some of the worst romantic writing this century. There is some merit to staying true to the actual story and I understand the desire to respect events and pay homage to the strength of character that the true people on which this film is based upon possess, but at the end of the day this is still a motion picture created for the purpose of entertainment and on that basis it fails miserably. The only date I would bring to this film would be one that I wanted to end things with, it's just that bad. There are more gaps in the story then in the female character's memory and it's more of a dual biography than an emotional tale that inspires some semblance of feeling.\r The real life situation of the actual people that inspired this movie is heart warming and sincere. This film however, is not and a monumental waste of everyone's time. I give everything about the production a 9, except for the script which was beyond terrible so I feel that giving it a -8 is generous, leaving the final score a 1."

The wooden acting of Tatum Channing with his relentless monotone and his inability to convey any convincing emotion makes one anxious for the end credits.  The pain is certainly dulled and brought into sharp contrast by the competent performance by Rachel Mcadams - who seemed to be ill at ease with the occasionally awkward dialogue."

It didn't attract me even one bit and I literally had to force myself to finish the movie & get touched by it. The acting & script was a little bad too. I admire Channing Tatum & Rachel Mcadams(especially) but their performances here were weak! It was not believable enough. This movie could have been a combination of happy, sad, tragic, & funny but unfortunately, the movie didn't quite sum up to all that. I must say, a very boring movie. But I like how it is based on a true story, which is why it should be told classically."

      "text": "A movie made for people who don't really understand relationships. It's essentially a fantasy for those women who never got past the \"ME\" stage.Tatum's Leo is basically written as the most perfect husband in the world, who bends so far over backwards to help his wife that he could get a new job as a contortionist. Problem is McAdam's Paige is about as likeable as a rock. Less so, actually because a rock wouldn't spend 2 hours treating someone like crap. Paige never does anything unselfish in the entire movie.  The movie felt like the middle act of your average RomCom where one party is just missing everything and needs to shape up before they lose what they have. My wife and I kept waiting for the turn around. Kept waiting for Paige to do something to make it seem like she actually appreciates everything Leo is doing, and try to reconnect the love she once felt. It never happens. At one point she tells him \"I'm tired of disappointing you,\" but it's woefully out of place because she's never even attempted to do otherwise. If she had seemed to make a single effort on Leo's behalf, it might have worked. But she doesn't. In fact, every time you think she's about to, she does something to make matters worse instead.Judging the movie by Paige's actions and the plot points, it seems like the it should really be about how she reconnects with her family who she hadn't spoken to for years before the accident. This might have worked if the majority of the movie isn't focused on Leo and if her parents hadn't been written as comically bad RomCom villains. The movie is a mess. Premise is great, but so sloppily written it's embarrassing. If it had just been about Leo and Paige, and how they rediscovered their love. Fine. If it had just been about Paige reconnecting with her family, thanks to the accident (silver lining and all that). Fine. Trying and failing to do both. No."

It has the feel of a documentary: no silly plot devices, no wild plot twists, no unbelievably strange or hateful characters.  Even Paige's (Rachel McAdams) father turns out not to be the skunk that I kind of expected him to be. This was a well-made, simply told movie.  Channing Tatum impressed me.  I have seen him as a dancer, as a roman legionnaire, and now as a romantic lead, and Angels, that boy does it all! And I'm telling you, if I could wear a hat like he does - in the movie- and smile mischievously-like he does in the movie-my sweetheart would never leave me. He is a boy, and I like girls, but he is tasty! And Rachel is very sweet.  Angels, they both act beautifully. Honestly, their body language and facial expressions were spot on. They were not acting; this is what was actually happening to them. My honey and I had a good time!  So why only an 8?  Well, the main weakness I think is that the plot did not match the title.  My honey made this point, I disagreed with her, but,  on reflection, she is right. The film is called 'The VOW'. A VOW is a declaration of super commitment-'To make this happen, I will move heaven and earth, and I will never give up.'  But Angels he didn't move heaven and earth. He gave up.  Look, he acted perfectly reasonably.  He was up against a lot of difficulties. Realistically, things looked hopeless. But he had made a VOW, and he did not keep it....Love you, Angels"

Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams both played their parts beautifully, but I kept feeling as though something else would happen along the storyline, but not much did. It was a story of a newly married couple that get into a car crash, and Paige (McAdams) loses her memory of the last 5 years of her life, which was the whole amount of time she'd known her husband. Her husband being a stranger to her, the premise was that he had to make her fall in love with him all over again. Throughout the movie though, not much else happened. I also expected it to be sadder than it was."

Rachel McAdams' character seemed pretty stupid and, given that it's a true story, it just makes it seem even more dumb. There have got to be 1000 such stories with \"smarter\" people involved or better endings. The fact that this movie was based on one with a moronic character and a mediocre ending shows just how masochist viewers are. The movie is slow, not emotional enough given the subject matter, and just in general not all that good. The only emotional part of the movie was the scene with Paige interacting with her mom near the end of the movie. The movie wasn't terrible but it definitely doesn't reach the elite chick-flick level."

      "text": "The Vow is a sweet film that reminds us of how one falls in love and how one actually can pursue and hold onto love when it appears lost forever.  It was an inspirational film, touching and cute.  However, it was lacking a strong core, a center to define pure love which is ever present in the real life couple's story that this movie was based on.  We do catch a glimpse of this in another couple's relationship in the movie, which only has survived against all odds.  However, the biggest upset of this film is that it doesn't even hold true to it's title.  If it had, it would have been a breath of fresh air in comparison to all the typical Hollywood adaptations of juvenile fantasy that is sold under the name \"romance\"; those culminations of high school daydreams that are ever predictable and unrealistic.  Don't get me wrong.  The Vow was okay, but it could have been ten times better if Hollywood hadn't dumbed it down to make it 'Hollywood' correct.  Sometimes the center of a story, however controversial it may be, just can't be replaced, especially by adequate actors and good cinematography."

Unfortunately, I think a lot of people automatically link The Notebook to Rachael Mcadams, and in my opinion, no love story will ever come close to that movie, so that could be held accountable for some of the disappoint for me personally. I still recommend, its definitely an easy, fun watch."

I can't say that I have seen many true 'roms', most romantic films I watch have the obligatory 'com' attached. The Vow's script has some light-hearted moments, however it definitely can't be classed as a 'rom-com'.\r McAdams brings her typical sweetness to the role and Tattum does his best, which might not uproot any trees in the acting world, but through his limited abilities, does bring a certain realness to his character.\r The plot is inevitably quite predictable, however, the writers deserve credit for not following the stereotypical plot sequence all the way through to the end. When my missus exclaims in horror that \"that's not how it's supposed to end!\", you know the film has achieved something at least."

It's odd that in a genre that requires depth and honesty to earn its audience, these kind of romances almost always come off as manufactured. Interestingly enough, it is Tatum here who gives the better performance. In fact, he's really improved in recent. It's McAdams who comes off as too cheery and slight for having her whole world tripped up. And happily, there are some laughably bad moments to enjoy for all the fuzz. It's all fairly harmless escapism, but don't get sucked up in the film's idea of romance. In other words, don't just eat cotton candy. In fact, stay away from it. It isn't good for you."
