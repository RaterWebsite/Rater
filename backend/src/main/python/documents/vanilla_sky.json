You take the different aspects and you don\u2019t have to necessarily have equal amounts of each, but you do need to try to manage the quality for each. If one part is mediocre, why even have it? Vanilla Sky was a blend of a number of genres including drama, romance, psychological thriller, science-fiction, and a bit of mystery. Vanilla Sky may have had all of this, but I will proudly say that I loved each and every unique aspect.\rVanilla Sky begins with the wealthy and sadly narcissistic, David Aames (Tom Cruise) waking up in his bed and going about his average morning with that smug grin he has. He drives from his house on his way to work and to his surprise; the streets of New York City are empty. Once he reaches the uninhabited Madison Square Garden, he begins to run in panic from his car. After running a good distance through the streets, he screams up into the sky and he wakes up from the nightmare. This scene may have little to do with the overall story, but I think it was an important sequence to show you what you\u2019re in for. I will tell you now, Vanilla Sky is confusing. The story chronicles the wide and deranged psyche of a man who goes insane, so it\u2019s going to challenge your mind as well. But this scene tells you up front that reality and dreamscape will be jumbled together in this film and you\u2019re going to have to figure it out. I make this connection because the movie begins with him in the dream, so you really don\u2019t know that it\u2019s a dream until he wakes up. Then throughout the rest of the movie you are tossed in and out of consciousness without warning, but it all adds to the experience.\rAnother thing that adds to the experience is the stylistic choices in this movie. I have seen some pretty stylistic movies in my life but man, this one had some style. The cinematography, the set pieces, the props, and the things people did were all so cool. Cameron Crowe did a fantastic job directing it too. I am a fan of Crowe, I liked Say Anything, loved Jerry Maguire, didn\u2019t care much for Almost Famous, but he\u2019s still a fantastic director and it shows in this one. There is a scene where Tom Cruise is in the lobby of L.E. screaming for tech support and the camera is spinning around him as he is standing in this empty room with his reflections surrounding him and this is one instance where the directing is very impressive. It really adds something and so does the soundtrack. This movie had such a collective soundtrack and every song fit so perfectly to the scene it was in. I\u2019ll talk about the same scene I did before and say that the choice of \u201cGood Vibrations\u201d to be in that scene was awesome.\rThere are many interpretations of Vanilla Sky and they all are interesting, but everyone has their own opinion.  The twist in this movie is that everything that happened after David fell asleep on the sidewalk was a dream that he was having in cryogenic sleep. He had killed himself after the car accident when he found a place called Life Extensions or L.E. where he could sleep contently forever with the perfect life. For a while, he does live a perfect life, he gets his face repaired and Sofia back and it\u2019s all good (he doesn\u2019t know he is sleeping at this time). But as we all know, we can\u2019t sleep for too long or else the dream can turn into a nightmare and when David begins to suspect something, that\u2019s when it does. I think this is a really cool concept and I really enjoy it in this movie. This mixture of subjects has never been done before and I don\u2019t think it ever will be again. Then the ending has multiple interpretations too. I believe that he chose to live a normal life and he decided to wake himself up from sleep and the end of the movie is him waking up from that sleep which happened to be 150 years. The moral of this story is that you can\u2019t run from your problems forever. David says that he wants to live a normal life and doesn\u2019t want to dream anymore meaning that he wants to take in the world for what it is and not live the perfect life he had always wanted because his problems even caught him there. The present is 150 years later so he can start over and take on the world without his handicaps like his father\u2019s inheritance. They even bring that up; his finances won\u2019t last long in this time.\rVanilla Sky did get mixed reviews from critics, but in the end, I do not agree with any of them. I think that Vanilla Sky may have a few flaws, but it is still an entertaining and intellectually rewarding movie that actually contains some beauty. It has a good message and there are a few others I didn't even mention. The stylistic choices were cool and the acting and directing were great. Vanilla Sky is a massive blend of many genres that come together to make a thought provoking and entertaining film that actually works."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "There is some psychological pressure along the movie, but the story do not seem natural and honestly it is a bit boring in the middle and the ending from my point of view is the thing called deus ex machina, it does not look logical.

If you can't wrap your head around epic, high-concept scifi, then go watch Animal House or something. This is a fantastically made and riveting film. Those scoring it on par with \"The Hottie and Nottie\" is deeply clueless."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I simply do NOT understand how anyone could say this film is anything but brilliant."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "A film which makes an attempt to pattern itself on the fantasy vs. reality films that had become popular at the turn of the new millennium - David Fichner's \"Fight Club\" and M. Night Shamalan's \"Sixth Sense\" both from 1999, Christopher Nolan's \"Momento\" from 2000, and David Lynch's \"Mulholland Drive\" released the following year (all of which don't surpass the reigning king of this genre when Terry Gilliam released his 1985 masterpiece \"Brazil\") - by no means fails in this respect since I found it both entertaining and intriguing for the most part, but is noticeably long and certainly may confuse the average '2hr-max-movie-goer'. Penelope Cruz and Cameron Diaz both stand out playing their respective, 'good gal/bad gal roles and Jason Lee is quite appealing as the best friend of our dashing lead Tom Cruise. Yet Cruise may be viewed as stretching this performance given the physical challenges that are demanded. I hesitate to reveal these challenges to those that have not seen the picture as they are indeed the focal point of the plot. Many good things like the witty Cameron Crowe retrospective soundtrack that is weaved into clever culture references and tributes which are indeed enjoyable and even necessary to solve the riddle presented in 'what's is going on?' scenario of the main character's pressing dilemma which may not be easy to access with a single viewing. But still the ride can be entertaining as Tom runs away and into trouble as he often does in quasi-action films that are laced with mystery and intrigue like Sydney Pollack's 1993 \"The Firm\", Brian De Palma's 1996 \"Mission Impossible\" and even the more cerebrally dark, \"Eyes Wide Shut\" from Stanley Kubrick. As noted by many educated critics as well as the tasteless tabloids Mr. Cruise may be biting off more than he can chew as he dives into the land of independent production. I applaud Tom for his efforts and are rooting for his 'comeback' yet do believe that his choice for future roles should include a return to comedic territory as a deviation/diversion to selecting elaborate/complicated efforts which could be prove a bit too risky and result in a poor reception at the box office."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Vanilla Sky is, fundamentally, a movie about lucid dreaming. And there is something about it that only lucid dreamers will recognize. Sadly, it's a bit downhill from there. While Vanilla Sky is a solid effort, it's unfortunately short of genius. The very project is a bit curious. Is Cameron Crowe, the permanent teenager responsible for perfectly good yet light-as-a-feather comedies like Jerry Maguire and Almost Famous, up to the challenge of remaking a Spanish psychodrama? Crowe goes through the motions, and from time to time he proves that he can handle heavier material, but Vanilla Sky is too murky to be much more than a holiday distraction  far from the cult classic that the original Abre los Ojos (Open Your Eyes) has become. However... Cameron Crowe's DVD commentary track is one of the best I've heard. While he's overly proud of the middling achievement, he's honest about the tepid reaction from test audiences, and he does provide a little extra context for the various interpretations of the movie. (Also of note, this is the first commentary I've heard with a musical score: someone (Crowe's wife, Nancy Wilson) playing acoustic guitar. Crowe also phones up his stars during the recording... bizarre.) Unfortunately, none of this can make Pen\u00e9lope Cruz a good actress. An interview with songwriter Paul McCartney, two featurettes, and assorted trailers round out the disc. Vanilla Sky has moments of brilliance and bears a certain style, but the movie is neither simple enough for sheer popcorn-thriller fun nor complex enough for true psychodrama buffs. It lies somewhere in a middle ground, and anyone that tells you different... needs to open his eyes."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "This movie had a lot of good things going for it but you can't have a dream when you're dead, people.

This movie is no exception. Let me just make a personal note before I make this review. I'm one of those people that saw this movie for the first time and understood everything, and something I have to note about is that this movie is a true Cameron Crowe masterpiece if you actually understand it. I really went through a lot of emotions when I watched this movie, this is one of the more cinematic movies I've seen. From the music to the very clever lines, and to the story pulling all together on one very well made elevator scene. This movie has a really cool vibe to it from the moment it starts. Plus the ending is mind blowing. I really love Paul Mccartney's song played in the credits, it really brings you down to earth after seeing such a breathtaking ending. If you want to watch this movie go ahead, I think that some of the critics were a little rough on this movie.

I would've marked it higher if not for the pointless explanation at the end....For the psychedelic  mystery genre it does a decent job falling just below decent."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "This is undoubtedly a bizarre watch but the real issue I found with it, is that the main character, David Aames, is really not likeable. Pretty much at all. I admit I'm not a big fan of Tom Cruise, which is partly why I hadn't seen this film until now. I heard that its partly about dreams and fantasy, the surreal and that aspect of it interested me, as I'm interested in quirky watches but this didn't really appeal to me. It felt like a pretty big ego trip for Cruise, with the main female characters being his characters love interests, there being various scenes of moderate to heavy flirtation going on and the rest of it.At first the film seemed relatively basic and I wondered what the fuss had been about it, as I knew it was the kind of film that people tend to want to re-watch, to see if they can understand things better, spot things earlier on, when re-watching it but it didn't seem too complicated at first, although that did change later on. I think that, for me, it was the cliches that jarred a bit too much for my liking. This is perhaps more a film for men than women? I don't know but I wasn't especially keen on it, although it is certainly quirky and bizarre, something a little different, although not without cliches. Overall, I suppose I'd say this is an average film. I think there are some interesting themes at play - showing your true identity etc. and I was intrigued a bit to try and discover more about what really happened, where the flashbacks present relate to different events but not everything is explained (its perhaps a bit David Lynch-esque) and I didn't feel I greatly enjoyed it, although it is a curious watch. Also it contains some good songs on the soundtrack, so thats a plus. Other people may well enjoy it more than I did but thats my thoughts on it.
