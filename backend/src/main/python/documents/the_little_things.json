Could not make it past half way.  Something about the color grading made every scene too dark, had to turn up tv brightness all the way even for brighter scenes, something I've never done before.

Maybe it could be called a character study, but as bewildering as this movie was put together you could still see the final moments coming. It feels like they were going for \u201cup-beat\u201d as it rolls credits, especially in the music cue, and that for me felt like a very wrong direction with the current climate in regards to law enforcement. I know there isn\u2019t a lot of new content out there right now, but this is skippable. Rewatch \u201cSeven\u201d and \u201cZodiac\u201d and you have most of what this movie draws from."

      "text": "Academy Award Winners Denzel Washington, Jared Leto, and Remi Malek star in the new thriller \u201cThe Little Things\u201d and combine to make very gripping and memorable performances.The script was reportedly written over thirty years ago by John Lee Hancock who has gone on to write, direct, and produce multiple films of note in the decades since he first created the screenplay.The film is set in 1990 and involves a cop named Joe Deacon (Denzel Washington), who travels from his small California town to Los Angeles to get information on a suspect.Joe has a history in L.A as he used to be a homicide detective for the department which combined with his meltdown while obsessing over a murder case has caused him more than a bit of notoriety.Jim Baxter (Remi Malek) is the hotshot new Detective who has been leading the investigation into a string of unsolved murders. Joe accompanies Jim to a new crime scene and notes some similarities with his unsolved case.Joe takes some personal days and begins to do some legwork on the case and reports his findings to Jim which causes Joe to remember aspects of what drove him to his marital, health, and career issues as he is unable and unwilling to let the case drop.When a prime suspect no longer fits into the picture; suspicions fall on a crime enthusiast named Albert (Jared Leto) who seems to check all the boxes but is also taking delight in winding up Joe which causes Jim to question if he is a viable suspect or just an oddball who gets off on crimes and winding up the cops but does not actually commit any offenses.As the delicate dance unfolds between the characters the fact that this is an era before Cell Phones, DNA tests, GPS, and elaborate computer networks helps underscore the plight of the officers. If the film was set in a modern setting much of the suspense and uncertainty of the story and characters would be moot thanks to technology.As the game of cat and mouse unfolds between the characters Jim learns how a person can become obsessed with a case and Joe attempts to mentor him from the success and failures of his life which includes some gray areas.Aside from the strong performances and engaging story what makes \u201cThe Little Things\u201d work is that it is a film that does not take the Hollywood fallbacks of extended gunfights, car chases, and over the top action scenes. What it does show is real and flawed characters that are doing what they think is right and does not attempt to wrap things up in a nice and tidy package.The film uses the element of doubt to not only drive the story but to help motizate  the actions of the characters and underscore the elements of uncertainty exists in some investigations.ambiguity also puts the focus on how investigations and procedures have evolved with the resources available to police.The film will appear in cinemas and HBO Max and is a compelling and well-crafted thriller that is not to be missed.4.5 stars out of 5"

Rambling, confusing, lugubrious to a fault, lacking substance, style or any kind of thrill or fear inducing storylines, the film falls far short of its much better predecessors such as David Fincher's brilliant, Se7en or Zodiac. I guess people thought, \"Oh yeah, lets get 3 Academy Award winners together in one film and it's bound to be incredible.\" No matter the fact that the script was weak and the direction even weaker. There's no need to go into any spoilers for this mess of a movie because I never got fully invested in any of the characters or the very uneven plotlines which were so full of holes and convoluted that it made no sense to try and follow it at all. The acting was marginal at best, even from Denzel Washington who never looked fully invested in the character. Rami Malek was terribly miscast as the other protagonist, (he would've been better as the killer, or taken a pass at this film) and Jared Leto was his usual self absorbed \"method\" self. In the end, none of this mattered because the movie never gets up on its legs and stands tall. A disappointment which goes to show that the little things DO matter, they just didn't matter very much here."

Denzel Washington stars as a Deputy Sheriff haunted by his past, who travels to LA for a quick assignment. Of course, this develops into a full-fledged manhunt as he partners with upstart detective (Ramy Malek). The prime suspect is played by an almost unrecognizable Jared Leto, who transformed himself into a greasy, gross sleazebag and the movie\u2019s only interesting character. This genre usually includes some graphic and sometimes sick crimes to add an element of shock. Sadly, this killer\u2019s cases are bland enuff for a TV show. To make matters even duller, there\u2019s virtually no suspense and the final encounter pushes credibility. What\u2019s left is character and relationship development, neither of which offered much more than solid performances from the cast. A bland procedural."

The cast is stacked with Oscar winners. The cinematography is evocative and appropriately seedy. Even the soundtrack finds Thomas Newman operating at a relatively notable level. The problem here is that when you really dig into the intangibles of this picture, you really start to understand how badly this movie needed to be produced in its initial heyday - the 1990's. From the familiar structure, to the trope-y stylings littered throughout, to the deeply problematic nature of the film's conclusion, all of it sings of a movie from years ago that's watchable, but really hasn't aged all that well. Problem is, this movie was produced in the present day, thus making its issues even more flagrant. It's not terrible, but really, truly needed a second look in the pre-production phase of things."

It simply doesnt work.Remi whatever is horribly casted. HE is the creepiest guy in any scene he's in. He does not nor will he ever look or sound like a cop, let alone an LA homicide detective which are some of the hardest guys wearing blue in the world. Freddie Mercury maybe, a detective? Never. The women in the film are more masculine.Don't waste your hard earned money on this mess. Stay home and watch Chinatown, Dirty Harry, or Silence of The Lambs.

Its formulaic approach, uninteresting and unengaging story line, and plot twists that are easily spotted from a distance epitomize the triteness that has come to characterize many recent films of this ilk. And, despite a seemingly stellar cast, the performances leave much to be desired; Denzel Washington and Rami Malek could have phoned in their portrayals, and Jared Leto's much-heralded but overrated performance is capable enough in spite of the implausibly written lines he's called upon to deliver. If movies of this type are your thing, you might find it enjoyable, even though it pales in comparison to many of its much better predecessors.

In one scene they are drinking and talking in a packed bar at 4:30 pm. I know the time from Rami\u2019s watch. No bars in LA are packed at 4:30 pm unless it\u2019s a Saturday and Superbowl weekend.

With three Academy Award winners like Denzel Washington, Rami Malek and Jared Leto this film could grad the attention of those Academy members and play well for general audiences. Let's see if this star-studded cast delivers the big performances to the theaters and streaming service.The Little Things follows Deke (Washington) a burnt-out Kern County, CA deputy sheriff who begrudgingly teams up with Baxter (Malek) a young and talented LASD detective, to catch an elusive serial killer. And get this Deke has an eye for the \"little things\" *wink wink* that always seem to be eerily spot on. Yet, Deke likes to take his liberties with the rules, which entangles Baxter in an internal struggle, going against his otherwise by-the-book ways. Meanwhile, Deke is tormented by a dark secret from his past. Seems like a typical storyline we've seen. Old cop revisits his old stomping grounds to help solve a case he couldn't solve before. Alright, great, so you've already got me bored; but it's not that simple. The film uses the basic story and a slight twist ending to give you the feels, chills, aches, and palpitations. The movie moves along at a smooth but slow pace, always building but I felt like I never made it anywhere. I was fully invested but left hanging. I'm just living with the fact that some filmmakers really don't know how to end movies anymore. They've given up on originality, and they've given up good endings. It's a reality that us as viewers, and patrons, deserve better.Trip: Let me interject on this point. I completely agree that this movie left me hanging. While I was generally conflicted the entire time because I felt like the film wanted to be 2021's version of Seven, but there's no real hook like the creep-factor that that movie had. Deke's secret is supposed to be the lynchpin that makes you wonder why he's so invested in the search for this serial killer, but that's not interesting enough to propel the film forward. The slow burn is fine, but it doesn't truly catch fire. Pardon the interruption.S2S: You done?Trip: blink... blink...S2S: Okay, then. Outside of the storyline and plot, let's get to our leading stars. Leto is creepy, greasy, and not his best work. I'd watch him as the Joker again over this but he does bring his character to life in a subtle way. As for my guy, Rami, his character was in a way creeper than Leto's. Yes, he grows on you as the movie goes on but again not his best work, enjoyable but also meh.Trip: Raises hand...S2S: Yes.Trip: Yeah, Rami is so creepy. I feel like that was bad casting. He did a good job, but he was miscast. To me, Leto was good, but I felt like he didn't have much to work with. I wish there as more of him.S2S: Anyway, as for my guy Denzel, this is the closest thing we'll get to the Equalizer who doesn't fight anymore. This tells me that Denzel needs to step away from these cop roles for a bit and give us his full acting ability again. Again, his character is fine but really just meh. I can't tell if it was the writing or the directing that left our three stars going to leave you wanting more.Trip: What he said.Needless to say, The Little Things is a solid movie on execution until the end. In a way this slow burn of a film floats through in a pleasing way but the end taste is not satisfying. For those who want to go to the theater and risk Covid, save your money and yourself. For those who already have HBO Max, you can catch munch on a bowl of unsalted popcorn for this film.Trip: The Little Things is an okay, paint-by-numbers detective chasing a serial killer movie, but it will leave you unsatisfied. I\u2019d say it is fine to watch sitting at home on a lazy Sunday afternoon."

      "text": "After seeing the heavy marketing push for this film it was impossible for me to say that this film wasn\u2019t on my radar. The Little Things is Warner Bros second movie to release day and date on HBO Max as well as theaters and out of all of these home releases from the past year I can happily say that I\u2019m glad that I didn\u2019t waste my time seeing this in theaters. The Little Things portrayed itself as this suspenseful thrilling crime drama about 2 cops trying to find a Californian serial killer in the 1990\u2019s. With heavy hitting actors like Denzel Washington, Rami Malek, and Jared Leto one would expect this to be an amazing film on the same caliber as something like \u201cSeven\u201d or \u201cZodiac\u201d, but The Little Things does very little to invest the viewer like those films and if anything it made me feel as if I wasted 2 hours of my life for a story that doesn\u2019t even matter by the end.One would assume that the main focus of the film is trying to catch a serial killer. Well you wouldn\u2019t be completely wrong. Here\u2019s the thing; catching the killer is something that the audience needs to know is the goal of the cops, but that story arc is not the one that the movie wants the viewer to grasp. The film does an amazing job portraying itself as this game of cat and mouse, but ultimately it tries to be a character study. Specifically for the characters of Jimmy, played by Rami Malek, and Deke, played by Denzel Washington. I personally do not have issues with character studies, but when the characters the audience is supposed to follow are bland at best then it is hard to want to feel for them. I was very surprised when I came to the conclusion that the acting in this film was mediocre at best. Denzel and Rami were beyond boring in this film with Jared Leto actually being a great supporting actor. Going into this film I was expecting Oscar worthy performances, but instead I got Tweedledee and Tweedledum trying to solve a case. By the end the case isn\u2019t even solved. You spent 2 hours watching a film hoping to catch this terrible person, but you don\u2019t. It is heavily hinted at who the killer could be, but even then no one can definitely know who it is. The point that the movie is trying to convey is that everyone can be just as bad as the serial killer if you let yourself become that bad. A message that I didn\u2019t need to waste 2 hours of my life to figure out. Ultimately The Little Things offers very little and it is a shame."

      "text": "The Little Things is a classic Noir Murder Mystery set in 1990 Los Angeles.  Deke, a small-town deputy previously banished from LA returns to his old beat to retrieve evidence needed for a small case in his new life.  While waiting for evidence to clear, he becomes marginally involved in a case being handled by Jim Baxter, a series of killings eerily similar to the case that sent him packing years before.  The unlikely pair manage to pool their talents to move the investigation forward and identify a suspect.  As in all good mysteries, nothing, including the strongest suspect, is what it appears, and Little Things becomes a redemption story in a tale where none of the heroes are innocent."

The story itself was fairly bland and I didn't care enough about the characters to have any emotional investment in the outcome. Seven, Copycat, Kiss The Girls, Zodiac and even Bone Collector (also starring Washington) are far superior to this film."
