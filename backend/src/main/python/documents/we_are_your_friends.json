Incorporated into the movie is a lot of \u2018eye candy\u2019 of both sexes along with a screenplay by the director Max Joseph and Meaghan Oppenheimer based on a story by Richard Silverman. It\u2019s an old story offering very few surprises along with an unnecessary \u2018aw shucks\u2019 moment during the end credits. Joseph does add a few musical and southern Californian collages that are eye catching and like other films recently, including last week\u2019s \u201cThe Diary of a Young Girl\u201d plus last year\u2019s \u201cBirdman\u201d, also uses animation.\r Aside from his good looks Efron hasn\u2019t impressed me yet with his acting though to be fair I have only seen him in 3 films and he does have an impressive scene talking about how a DJ works the crowd. His friends played by Jonny Weston who wants to be a club promoter, actor and drug dealer played by Shiloh Fernandez and Alex Shaffer as the hanger on nerd offer good support. Wes Bentley is a has-been DJ living off his past and has a younger girlfriend, Emily Ratajkowski, with the latter basically in the pretty girl role.\r \u201cWe Are Your Friends\u201d was an interesting movie from the point of view I knew nothing about how electronic computer music is made and, of course, nothing wrong with eye candy. It was also interesting for the \u2018second movie\u2019 I watched in my head.\r When I saw Wes Bentley, September, 1999, when he was 21, in \u201cAmerican Beauty\u201d I walked out thinking \u201cWow! This is the next generation\u2019s Kevin Spacey!\u201d For the next decade he descended into the world of drugs admitting he made movies only to make money for drugs. He is 37 today, has been clean since 2009 and between his appearance in a Broadway play in 2010 and playing Seneca Crane in \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d in 2012 he has been working his way back but he lost the momentum of stardom that pursued him 16 years ago.\r Zac Efron had his breakout role in \u201cHigh School Musical\u201d in 2006 followed by the movie version of the Broadway musical \u201cHairspray\u201d when he was 19 and 20.  In 2013 at the age of 26 it was reported that he completed an alcohol and substance abuse program. Now at 28 will he have a decade unlike the one Bentley had? Did Wes talk to Zac and give him advice and/or did Zav ask Wes what happened and how could he avoid the same mistakes?\r Now that\u2019s a film I would like to see---and make!"}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Featuring stellar performances but uneven drama, We Are Your Friends might be the perfect end-of-summer story, yet it suffers from card-board cutout, insufferable characters."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "I don\u2019t think there is anyone in the world that actually thought this was going to be a good film after watching the trailer, and its not good at all. I think this story is impossible to care about. It is just a plot that very few people have any sort of interest in. This movie has way too many things going on for a film that is less than 100 minutes long. There are too many storylines and two many characters that take away from a simple overall story and finally by the third act the film is just a complete mess. Jon Bernthal is also thrown into the mix in this movie and he has no reason to be there, plus we have Cole\u2019s friends who are annoying for most of the film and just become so generic.\r There are really no awful performances in this film. Zac Efron and Wes Bentley are both fine in their roles and the scenes with the two actors involved where the best in the movie, but it is Emily Ratajkowski who steals the show. I almost feel bad for these actors for making such a terrible choice in a project. The script is just so weak and swollen that by the ending of the film the characters really aren\u2019t much further than where they started."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "\u0634\u0631\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062b\u0627\u062b \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062a\u0639\u0645\u0644 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0636\r\u0627\u0631\u0642\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u062b\u0627\u062b \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0639\u0645\u0644 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0636\r\u0634\u0631\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u062b\u0627\u062b \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0639\u0645\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0636\r\u0634\u0631\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062b\u0627\u062b \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062a\u0639\u0645\u0644\r\u0645\u062d\u0644\u0627\u062a \u0634\u0631\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062b\u0627\u062b \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062a\u0639\u0645\u0644 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0636\r\u0645\u062d\u0644\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062b\u0627\u062b \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062a\u0639\u0645\u0644 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0636\r\u0634\u0631\u0643\u0629 \u0634\u0631\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u062b\u0627\u062b \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0639\u0645\u0644 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0636\r\u062d\u0642\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062b\u0627\u062b \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062a\u0639\u0645\u0644 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0636\r\u0634\u0631\u0643\u0629 \u0641\u0631\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0645\u0644\u0643\u0647"}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Not a bad movie at all - just one lacking any serious ambition.

So yeah, I didn't get it with the story and it's confusing trailer alone, but I think this is the perfect movie whether you're an EDM fan or not. \"We Are Your Friends\" may have lacked charisma for a reality MTV-less generation, but I think Zac Effron did a great job.

That's not it, so far he had failed to take the right project to work with. His films are either having no story or a silly concept and his roles among the worst. I could have liked this film if it was done by some other young actor. It looked a decent storyline on how an aspiring DJ is fighting to make progress. Living with his friends, then suddenly an opportunity knocks and followed by some issues surround it that should be solved to see the success in his passion in the music. So the remaining is to reveal how the things go on for him.Too slow narration, and it is being a music genre, a little soulless. Yeah, there's no rhythm. All we have seen a DJ while performing, but what his life would be like is what this film was focused on. Directional debute for a documentary filmmaker and he should make a couple of things right for his next film, including casting right actors and preparing an engaging screenplay.
