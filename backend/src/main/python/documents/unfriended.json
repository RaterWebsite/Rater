It's worse than the Paranormal Activity Franchise. The actors in unfriended are terrible, it feels as if they are just reading their words off a script that is in front of them. People are saying that the video call format for the film is creative. No. It isn't creative, it is because the film is low budget. Also, half the film is a mouse moving around the screen and clicking on random crap. If I wanted to spend half an hour watching a mouse move around a screen I would give my grandma a computer and watch her try to work it for half the film. The story plot is OK until you realise that the thing killing all the friends is actually the ghost of Laura. She committed suicide because of a video of her passed out on the floor with poo on her leg. Another thing I want to complain about is the unoriginality of the film. 'Lets play a game', I wonder what film we have heard that quote in... People that are saying that it's tense and scary properly get scared of their own shadow. Overall, the film is a waste of time and I don't recommend it to anyone under the age of 10."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "I gave it a 1 for effort but this movie is just awful honestly.

There is a long list of movie elements missing from this, and caused me a great deal of disappointment.  Literally, there's 6 or 7 main characters.  Anyone with a PalTalk, YouTube, Skype, Facebook, and understanding of QuickTime could have made this movie.  There's zero talent there.  The plot of the movie leaves a lot of predictability for the end outcome, right from the first few minutes!  Probably worse than anything else is that I was hoping this might actually be a believable thriller about social media and internet technology that might teach a few people a good lesson.  On this front, it failed miserably.  This is total fiction.  Unless you believe that ghosts are computer-savvy, or that people using social media could be talented enough to form a collective group of 6 individuals networking to coincidentally knock off 6 people that had something to do with the death of a teenager on the date of her anniversary, this is a waste of time.  Sadly, the characters in this movie were compelled not to shut down their browsers and simply meet in person?  Holes, holes, holes.

What makes this concept so unique is the point of view: one girl's computer screen. All the action takes place via Skype, YouTube, Facebook, Google, other popular internet-based apps, even Spotify for the soundtrack. That's interesting, but then you have to put up with the teens who constantly over-dramatize, freak out and scream a lot.

The whole movie is done in real time. The characters are intriguing and the suspense builds from beginning to end. This movie has its flaws, therefore it's not a 9 or a 10 but for what it is, it does well. It's obviously an anti-bulling message. The whole movie is basically sharing the screen with the protagonist. You see her messages, ims, skypes, etc. That was a very neat concept and I praise that aspect infinitely. However, the cliches are also very obvious and the killer talks in the way that a mother would text, which kinda took away from the zing. However, the story was neat and the acting was awesome! There is also a lot of comedy thrown into the mix. It's a little bit of everything. You'll laugh your butt off and you'll also feel the dread building. Personally I'll say this is a very innovative horror movie and could've totally been a 10 but fell into too many cliches. See it if you're interested; I'm sure you'll enjoy. But it kinda sucks to know how great of a movie this could've been had it not done some of the things it did.

It's been a great season for horror fans with It Follows and now Unfriended in the lineup. (Though I'm not looking forward to much of the rest of the samey, occulty crap the industry has in the pipeline.  Vatican Papers?  Ugh.)  It fallows is more classic, retro horror, but Unfriended is horror for the new tech-savvy generation. It's a bit of a fable, really. I love the use of technology and the rules that define the action. In the same way that Blair Witch introduced the found footage element to horror, Unfriended does the Skype/YouTube thing perfectly.  Shelley Henning as Blair holds down the sympathetic lead role extremely effectively.  She's always been an underrated actress who has played the supporting role in such teen fare as Teen Wolf, Secret Circle, and Zach Stone is Gonna Be Famous, and I'm hoping that her exposure in this movie puts her into that category of actor who is considered for leads. Speaking of acting, all of the young actors in Unfriended bring a level of authenticity to the proceedings - they simply feel real. The film's only drawback - and this is something that bugs me about many horror flicks such as the Paranormals - is the excessive reliance on demons or spirits of the dead. It's almost a cop out - how does a spirit use Skype?  Oh well, don't worry about it, it's a leap!  I suppose I'm yearning for a bit more tangible reality in my horror such as the raw, depraved humanity of Rutger Hauer in The Hitcher.  But that's just nitpicking, I suppose.

But the few ideas it chucks at it do click. The story plays out like MTV's Catfish meets a really bad horror movie. The first half of the movie is not horror, it's young brats' Facebook and Twitters being shown, family photos, scam websites, so basically it's a teaching of the Internet plus a stupid teen love story you know you are gonna hate. The other 80 minutes is where the sh*t hits the fan, and it is... Pretty fun. Really, the jump scares and high octane thrills are well timed and just there and provide us with a better side of this already bad movie. It is a pretty good idea though, a psychopathic killer hunts down the people who shot an embarrassing video of her and she committed suicide, turns out is she alive? The thrill is nice but it could have been placed in a better movie than what we have here. I could have recommended it just for the thrills, but I review on the whole movie, and it isn't good.

Skype, Facebook, Google, messaging, you'll watch this group of teens use it all to interact with one another and the vengeful spirit while they play \"Never Have I Ever.\" This movie is really an anti-bullying message meant for this technology obsessed generation.\r It's remarkably entertaining to watch these teens turn on each other as their darkest secrets are being revealed. They are a remarkably convincing group of youngish actors who react just like they should when betrayals among each other are revealed, as well as reveals in the larger plot of what roles they all played in the bullying (both cyber and other) of their now deceased tormentor.

Something like sitting next to a friend's computer and looking what he's doing.\r I think it was a good film, keeps us guessing till the final minute. I'm watching it a bit late, but very happy I did not miss it after all and there is already a second film getting ready which is due this year's end. But I doubt the film won't get anywhere near to this one. The franchise might end up like 'Paranormal Activity' if sequels keeping coming. The actors were good though. I thought one of them was Jennifer Carpenter where one of the film posters resembles 'Quarantine', but during the watch I realised it was a different actress.\r Despite the familiar theme, the setting makes all the difference and pretty entertaining. The end scene was a surprise, because until that point I was not aware of this film genre. Definitely worth a watch for modernising the old storyline with lots of suspense.\r 7/10"}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Give credit where credit is do the concept works for the most part.  I wasn't expecting much and I got a film that at least kept me interested in a game of Never have I ever. C+"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Although Unfriended isn't very scary (it sells itself as a thriller/horror movie), it manages to be innovative. It is done in real time on a Mac computer screen, and we only see the narrator (Blaire's) point of view the whole film. This same technique was done on an episode of Modern Family, so maybe the creators of this \"movie-in-a-computer\" setting are on to something.\r As for the movie itself, it's not great. The characters are all stereotypes, and the story is pretty passive, leading to a predictable conclusion. However, it is only the beginning of film mastery in this new medium."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Unfriended doesn't entirely capitalize on its #cool premise through its lack of scares, but still delivers a reasonably fun horror movie that its specific target audience will enjoy."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Yep, this is the \"Skype horror movie\".\r It's a novel idea, making a movie that takes place entirely on a teenager's laptop screen, with all of the characters communicating via Skype video chat.\r A fun and interesting twist on the found-footage genre, although not a found footage film per se it undeniably takes its inspiration from those movies.\r As interesting as the concept for this movie is, it is also restrictive. The characters are one dimensional and aren't the most likable bunch which leads me to not care for their fates.\r All in all it's a neat little movie that has some flaws namely being lapses in logic or common sense on the characters' behalf. If I were them I would have hung up on the Skype call: \"peace out **** I'm going to sleep\", and then would have shut down my laptop and have gone to sleep. Another little grievance of mine is: they're teenagers, where the hell are all of their parents? I'm just supposed to believe that all of them are alone in the house and are part of an only child club? Come on.\r It's an obvious cautionary tale about the dangers of cyber bulling, the moral of which is: don't be a dick! (also don't talk to people on Skype, that **** is haunted!)\r Unfriended is a Blair Witch Project for the Facebook generation. Take that statement whatever way you want."}], "recommendations": ["paranormal_activity_the_marked_ones", "unfriended_dark_web", "chernobyl_diaries", "paranormal_activity_4", "the_devil_inside", "paranormal_activity_2", "the_strangers", "the_curse_of_la_llorona", "the_haunting_in_connecticut", "stay_alive", "countdown", "would_you_rather", "paranormal_activity_3", "better_watch_out", "splice", "the_blair_witch_project", "brightburn", "dark_skies", "the_bye_bye_man", "bird_box", "the_purge", "host", "devil", "the_possession", "slender_man"]}
