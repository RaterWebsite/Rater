His only concern is to make money in anyway. He is a second hand car seller.Mother is modern pop life wife with her only concern of her look.Then there is a School Master who is an frustrated fat sportive single woman terrorising the kids.And finally teacher of Matilda's class  at the school. She  is a good heart angel, and also a victim of school master.Self created, and self confident Matilda feels strong, and becomes a fighter against all the bullying of her parents, and school master.I just love the Matilda creating herself by reading a lot of books, but it felt bit superficial when she got witch like powers like moving things around.This is a great raw comedy. But again, witch like talents were bit too much.My most favorite scene was where Matilda visits the Public Library, and librarian lady asks her if she likes to have books with a lot of picture, her response to the lady."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "----------------------------------9.5/10-----------------------------------"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "It does all seem quite artificial, exaggerated and unrealistic, but it's also inspiring and fun."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "rude movie, annoying and irresponsible child, just wants revenge, I've never seen the movie where it encourages evil"}], "recommendations": ["wonder", "the_perks_of_being_a_wallflower", "stuart_little", "about_a_boy", "the_willoughbys", "endless_love", "sky_high", "12_mighty_orphans", "captain_fantastic", "nanny_mcphee", "young_adult", "the_spiderwick_chronicles", "moxie", "tooth_fairy", "christopher_robin", "juno", "little_monsters", "midnight_sun", "freedom_writers", "mean_girls", "you_again", "the_spectacular_now", "dora_and_the_lost_city_of_gold", "lady_bird", "the_glass_castle"]}
