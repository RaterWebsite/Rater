We will see if Hathaway can manage a similar transtion. In regards to this movie, I must admit I had to start fast forwarding."

This version had less of an impact to feel for the kids turning into mice than the original. There are a couple of things I did like about the movie, the mixture of the cast , and some of the actors . Would I recommend this movie..\"NO\", but would suggest watching the original. Not every movie has to be Americanized"

      "text": "I don't see how even the cast and crew of this remake can possibly think this comes even close to the original. The only reason I even gave it 2 stars is for Roald Dahl. This remake ended the way the book ended, with the children staying mice.  The original movie had a happier ending where they were turned back into human by a witch that had turned good.  I much prefer the happier ending of the original movie myself, but Roald Dahl hated it, he wanted it to end with the children staying mice because that's how he wrote the book.  I read that he even stood outside some theaters trying to talk people out of going into see it.  So the only reason I'm giving it 2 instead of 0 is for Roald Dahl (may he RIP), even though most people probably prefer the original, he may have preferred this remake."

Great direction and a fantastic cast, in particular Angelica huston who was superb as the grand high witch. Why anyone thought this needed a remake i don't know.Why take the setting of the movie to Alabama?!! or the U.S in general? why do we feel the need to Americanise everything?! Everything about this horrible remake is awful, the cast are bad and over act to a ludicrous degree and all the creepiness of Dahls writing has been replaced with a Disney like sugar coating. As a huge Dahl fan it's hard to put into words how bad i think this film is.."

      "text": "A soulless remake that may be too frightening for kids and too dumb for adults. The lack of charisma in the young actors and the overuse of CGI makes the previous film superior on every level. The only good thing about this movie is the presence of Hathaway and Spencer, whose scenes are the funniest. There's also an important racial subtext at the beginning, but Zemeckis and del Toro don't develop it further."

Anne Hathaway is great as is Octavia Spencer and while its far from Zemeckis's best film, it works as a family comedy.On the negative side, I wasnt a fan of some of the screenplay decisions that they made and I found it odd that they gave the witches Ectrodactyly hands and feet and did it with low budget B-movie CGI. Still, if you are in the mood for a family comedy with a dark mood then give it a try."

      "text": "Although countless people see this as a remake and not as a new adaptation, it's true that it's inevitable to compare it with Nicolas Roeg film, and unfortunately for this one, in that comparison it loses out.This new version by Robert Zemeckis is aimed at a child audience, like the first one, and I think that in that regard kids will enjoy it as those who enjoyed the 1990 film.However, if you take a closer look at what this film does wrong, you will realize that it far outweighs what it does well.And it is that Zemeckis abandoned the virtues of a strong narrative long ago and changed them for the visual impact and he makes that mistake again here.The film feels artificial, from the performances to the sets.Like a cartoonish world, unable to captivate or immerse you in its tonality.It doesn't risk anything and that same passivity is what makes it a film that perhaps can entertain the little ones for a while, but for any movie fan over 15 years old, there's nothing to rescue here."

Lets not sugarcoat the original too much, changes were made from the source material which even as a kid I wasnt happy with. But this is a fun film, kept me engaged.  Hatherway obviously had a great time filming and it shows, and Octavia Spencer was the standout.  CG is occasionally  meh however the film looked gorgeous,  I didnt mind the transfer to America as its general themes run true wherever you base the plot."

      "text": "Feels weird to watch a children's movie tailor-made to scare the crap out of them. Actually, upon reflection I'm amazed at how many horror flicks were designed with kids in mind. From Gremlins to Coraline and pretty much everything from Tim Burton, apparently watching something with the potential to give you nightmares is fun regardless of your age. And let me tell you parents, you're definitely risking your son and/or daughter's sleeping pattern with this one.The titular witches are terrifying in their disgusting, monstrous true forms. Not even Anne Hathaway's figure flattering dress and ridiculous, yet very committed performance can make her any less unsettling to look at when she loses the wig and gloves. Personally, I don't think I would have been able to handle this growing up.In order to keep things from getting too frightening for the target audience, the film balances the more hair-raising stuff with plenty of silly humor. There's a whimsical, escapist tone running throughout even during the darker moments that keeps things from ever getting too serious or intense and crossing over into the realm of adult-oriented entertainment. Perhaps too much so during the second half. The movie starts off with the perfect amount of fantasy and fairytale vibes. There's a strong emotional component that allows you to sympathize with and get invested in the young protagonist and his grandmother, with hints of race-related social commentary going on in the background. As soon as the first person gets turned into a mouse though it all starts to get steadily more over-the-top before devolving into a full-blown farce by the end.Yet, its worse flaw is Chris Rock's narration. His unbelievable old southern man accent only served to make me question how I could have possibly failed to notice he can't act before now. Outside of that there's not much too complain about. So if you've ever wanted to help ensure your future cinephile(s) enter adulthood with a healthy appreciation for the horror genre this will make for a nice building block. You may want to start with something tamer like 2015's Goosebumps, but regardless of when you get around to showing this to them I'm sure you'll find it to be petrifying fun for the whole family.8.3/10"

Sadly there is something lacking in the small changes to the setting and plot that take away from the flavour of the original book in my opinion. Octavia is fantastic throughout but Chris rock as the grown narrator felt like mis casting to me. Minor gripes aside it was a fun 'switch off' and watch film."

Firstly, the story is clearly suited to children, especially around 8-12 yo, however they have overlayed an almost horror-esque SFX take that is actively disturbing rather than suggestively scary. Then there Anne Hathaway's character - possibly the worst acting I've seen (and making me think she was entirely a CG actor... please learn how to do accents). Finally there was the overall structure of the movie... it was just cartoonish to the point of absurdity. The fact this is based on a Dahl book doesn't matter - it's a horrible movie, and one I think was more scarring to our kids in an almost sadistic and creepy way. This was a huge missed opportunity..."

The Witches came from good intentions but it stays there, just an homage to the classic and nothing more."
