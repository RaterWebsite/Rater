      "text": "The question is, does the viewer want an exciting Liam Neeson action thriller or not? The other question is, have we ever seen such a movie set on the ice roads near the Arctic Circle? Neeson does deliver a particular set of skills, in this case dangerous big-rig driving, and has to fight for his life along the way, together with his Iraq-vet brother and a drop-dead gorgeous Cherokee girl. Only the coda is predictable, but the action isn't, and it goes beyond mere hand-to-hand combat."

It's an entertaining  nail biter with lots of action and adventure, twists and turns you don't see coming and a nice change to see cold and ice after this super hot 100 degree weather!  Definitely recommend!. :-)"

      "text": "Liam Neeson is back on the action road\u2026literally. This time, he\u2019s one of several drivers who are tasked with transporting equipment to save trapped miners in Upper Canada. The route is literally ice and the perils are numerous. Even though the rivers are relatively straight, the road continually curves with calamities and challenges that only a superhuman hero can solve. Most of them involve manipulating the trucks in various ways (a clear promo for the Kenworth brand). The project has a cheesy made-for-TV feel with underdeveloped characters, sad attempts at emotional connection and increasingly implausible logic. Even though some of the feats are unfeasible, the execution is rarely impressive, plus the insistent score continually attempts to ramp up the tension. Overall, this is a middling action adventure."

      "text": "So, when is Liam Neeson retiring from action movies? He said he would a while ago.The movie itself, very predictable and stupid, not the best kind of stupid for these types of movies. The visual effects looked so awful and unconvincing I questioned if I was watching a Sci Fi channel movie. The directing wasn\u2019t anything notable and the writing was so horrendous, ridiculous situations and none of it was believable. I had a hard time finishing this one.I can't believe that both Liam Neeson and Laurence Fishburne agreed to be in this.'The Ice Road' is cold and boring."

The only question is why Morpheus , oh I mean Laurence Fishbourne    agree to be in a movie for five minutes."

      "text": "It felt like the film took the easy way out for what little character development it had. Liam has largely been the same nice guy in a few films so they just kind of leaned on that for this film. Early in the film, within about 90 seconds, we meet the brother, find out he's mentally challenged, he gets picked on, Liam's character saves him...again. There's a Mice & Men moment when we're shown the brother's pet mouse, er..., I mean rat, and he luckily doesn't squeeze him to death. It all happened so fast it felt odd and I suspect it's only because of Liam's past that you could set up the main characters so quickly. Next, there's Mr. Goldenrod. A name choice that baffled me because I used to work for a large studio and know about script paper colors. It was just weird to me.Then there's a throwback to a scene right out of Forrest Gump when he fixes the 'ain't got no gas' lawnmower and later reassembles his weapon faster than anyone else. In Ice Road, it is a different kind of motor the brother fixes. That's enough. It wasn't a very good film and as other armchair critics have said, it seems strange both Liam N. and Samuel L. Jackson said yes to this. (Lawrence Fishburn. Just seeing if you're paying attention this far down)."
