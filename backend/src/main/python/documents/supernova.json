Since Tusker was diagnosed with early-onset dementia two years ago, their time together is the most important thing they have.  As the trip progresses, however, their ideas for the future clash, secrets come out, and their love for each other is tested as never before. Ultimately, they must confront the question of what it means to love one another in the face of Tusker\u2019s illness.", "releaseYear": "2020", "mpaaRating": null, "imageUrl": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/xpLi04zHu36TH8nuvFAwAF3LUkq.jpg", "categories": {"plot": 0.75, "acting": 0.5, "ending": 5.0, "soundtrack": 5.0, "cinematography": 5.0, "familyFriendly": 5.0, "funny": 0.0, "action": 0.0}, "reviews": [{"rating": "8", "text": "iggugiguihugihuhiihojyfugyfguyfguguigugugihugdsrsrfuihohihihihihihihihhiihhiigyfguiyi7y"}, {"rating": "4", "text": "I rented Star Wars III (Revenge of the Sith) and this over the weekend. After suffering through the last Star Wars, an unmitigated disaster, I actually thought better of this sorry work - at least it showed that there is flesh underneath the makeup, something George Lucas forgot years ago."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Spider-Man 3 is the Lawrence Of Arabia of the superhero movies world. It is epic, sprawling, magnificent, meaningful, beautiful. Anyone who doesn't enjoy this movie must be a pretty spoilt brat or a cynical old misery. For near on three hours it envelops you in its world and makes you CARE about the characters. How's that for a special effects laden blockbuster, a movie with characters that matter? The comedy works, the emotion works, the action works. Everything Raimi tries comes off. The set pieces are particularly astounding, ranging from an out of control crane to Spidey's numerous battles with the meaty villains on show. Like others, I think this is by far the best of the three (though I loved the first two as well). It's a modern-day classic, an enrapturing fantasy that exhibits all that's best in modern movie making. An experience not to be missed."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "It's a little dry, but definitely not worthy of the unanimous dislike pointed its way. Predictable, but nice to look at.

Expected higher quality but instead i get garbage. Just a waste of time and we could watch better movies. Terrible SFX, terrible voicing, terrible story, what else?"}, {"rating": "1", "text": "One of the worst movies I've watched in a long time. The pacing is all over the place, only one character was remotely relate-able, and while some of the CGI is passable the practical special effects are laughably bad on any budget.\r I also feel like it's one of those movies that give the genre a bad name, the plot is essentially: ship breaks, evil guy turns up with shiny MacGuffin, tries to kill everyone, dies, ship fixed, survivors fly off into the sunset. It lacks any substance, and most of the decisions characters make have more to do with eeking out another 10 minutes of running time than solving the issues at hand.."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Supernova, although it is a Sci-Fi thriller, is mediocre as a film. There is absolutely nothing here that you want to praise the film for. It's just a B-level thriller that has no suspense. A dull main antagonist and predictable ending. You can recommend for viewing only the most ardent fans of the genre"}], "recommendations": ["independence_day_resurgence", "the_darkest_hour", "pacific_rim_uprising", "jupiter_ascending", "monsters", "the_matrix_resurrections", "transformers_the_last_knight", "into_the_storm", "poseidon", "geostorm", "battleship", "riddick", "bloodshot", "the_tomorrow_war", "the_new_mutants", "volcano", "rampage", "mad_max_fury_road", "battle_los_angeles", "clash_of_the_titans", "gravity", "pandorum", "the_cloverfield_paradox", "world_war_z", "underworld_blood_wars"]}
