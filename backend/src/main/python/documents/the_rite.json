Featuring cats, frogs, demons, and blaspheming soon-to-be priests, The Rite works best at dedicating itself as a paid sponsorship for your own future exorcism. Perhaps you should also invest in a lawyer, suing for fraud in false advertising as a Horror film."

This movie takes the idea of demons residing in people seriously, framing it in a story about a non-believer and a believer.  There are quite a few scary moments, and the exorcisms are rather realistic...no turning around of heads, and no pea soup."

      "text": "Although the exorcism sub-genre has been nearly worn to a frazzle, it is always refreshing when the film industry develops an original idea rather than churning out sequels and remakes. The Rite is sufficiently original in this regard; though overly reliant on cliches, stereotypes and the usual faith-versus-evil boilerplate, the film manages to keep you engaged mostly through the sheer talent of Sir Anthony Hopkins.At its core The Rite is the story of a young man tortured by uncertainty and indecision, walking the line between faith and skepticism. He is the archetypal faith-questioning falling-from-grace antihero we have seen waltzing through any number of religious dramas; yet for a character of such supposed moral complexity, our young seminarian is disappointingly static. This poor development is illuminated in contrast by the talent and experience of Hopkins. His portrayal of the unorthodox and tortured mentor simply dominates. In fact, once the movie reaches its pedestrian climax, you may find yourself wondering why the hero and the equally forgettable love interest/damsel are even in the room. Hopkins probably could have turned a more enthralling scene via monologue with his inner demons.Even so, The Rite is watchable. There are some things it does right: the veiled debate between supernatural and psychology that subsists throughout, for instance, is handled delicately and subtly enough as to enrich rather than distract. This possession-versus-mental-illness dynamic establishes a palpable sense of dread and unhinged suspense (despite some cheap jump scares and one unfortunate cat scare). Rather than preach or spoon-feed emotion and sentiment, the film leaves most of the judgments and evaluations for the viewer (that is, until the resolution wraps everything into a nice neat package). And, despite prominently featuring the Catholic faith, the church is neither endorsed nor denigrated but rather skillfully employed as a neutral backdrop to establish setting and tone.Classic cinema it is not, but overall, The Rite is a decent supernatural horror drama that won't leave you feeling like you've wasted two hours. Hopkins turns a solid but not brilliant performance, and you may be left scratching your head as to how he became attached to this project."

      "text": "Father Lucas(Anthony Hopkins) is not one of those diva Roman Catholic priests who shows up only when the devil gets ready to take complete possession of its victim's soul. This church servant, differing from his American counterparts, makes house calls on lesser cases, routine visits to his afflicted parishioners, just like a French doctor in Michael Moore's \"Sicko\". He's no Father Merrin(Max Von Sydow), a priest with a thing for dramatic lighting. His exorcism skills, as it turns out, are subpar. It's time for him to retire; he's too old to be the hero. Frankly put, the members of his flock are in trouble, because this man of the cloth is just not that powerful. To its credit, \"The Rite\" deviates somewhat from the oft-used template of William Friedkin's \"The Exorcist\", just enough to make things mildly interesting. Although \"The Rite\" employs the all-too-familiar trope of the demon possessed victim being a young woman, she's not the central figure of the story, since her supernatural ordeal with nefarious forces is not an isolated case. The film treats demonic possession as if it was a common malady, like the flu. Father Lucas has the aura of a country doctor, which is to say, he doesn't inspire awe. In addition to the pregnant girl that Lucas treats at his cat-infested abode, there's the battered boy covered with horse tracks he learns about from his extra-curricular rounds. Unlike past \"Exorcist\" knockoffs such as \"The Haunting of Emily Rose\" and \"The Last Exorcism\", the curing of the bedeviled young woman is not the primary objective of the film. In fact, the Italian girl doesn't get cured at all; she dies, in a surprising move, bringing to mind Alfred **** \"Psycho\", because her death thwarts audience expectations. The moviegoer expects Rosaria(Marta Gastini) to be there for the climax. But like Janet Leigh in that Bates Motel shower, the impregnated teenager meets a violent untimely end. Her swelled belly then becomes a red herring. Since the girl never named a father, the film teases you with the notion that Satan sired that baby. At the hospital, we're half-expecting her to give birth. But when the demon kills them both, we realize that the girl was an ancillary character all along. A \"Rosemary's Baby\" situation is averted. She was knocked up the old-fashioned way: the devil wouldn't kill his own spawn. Father Lucas fails her. More often than not, the priest can be counted on to save the day, but here, the servant fails; it's the man of god who needs saving. In \"The Rite\", it takes an atheist to do a clergyman's job. Michael Kovak(Colin O'Donoghue), the heretic from the states, needs a lot of convincing, maybe too much convincing(how many frogs will it take to convince you Mike?), before he finally acknowledges that the devil exists. \"The Exorcist\" exists, too. Father Lucas makes reference to \"spinning heads and pea soup\" when the fraudulent seminary school graduate appears unimpressed after witnessing his first exorcism. Foregoing the shock tactics of the 1973 chiller, \"The Rite\" presents itself as a respectable take on demonic possession. The film is notable for its lack of gore...and scares. Although Rosaria coughs up blood and nails, what \"The Rite\" needs is for the girl to regurgitate the blood and nails in the priest's face. By not embracing its exploitation movie roots, the girl might as well have psychological problems, because a tempered flick about the devil, as \"The Rite\" proves time and time again, can make for a pretty dull experience. Where's the blasphemy?"

      "text": "This film was always going to divide opinion. It's hard to tackle religion, theology and the prospect of demons and angels without arguments breaking out between believers and nonbelievers. As one who saw the film seeking entertainment and diversion - I can say I found it immensely entertaining. Indeed, I'm really quite astonished at just how violently the critics are canning this. The mood is excellent, the setting is divine, the cinematography immersive and the characters well rounded and believable. In addition, the demonic possession scenes don't stoop to spinning heads and climbing on ceilings to enhance the scare, but rely also upon well written dialogue which tends to be as thought provoking as it is mildly disturbing. Hopkins is magnificent, as per usual. All in all, it's probably the best movie of it's kind I've ever seen, critics be damned (if you'll pardon the pun). Go see it!"

I've just seen it and... well, Anthony Hopkins is, whether you like or not, a machine-gun in your head shooting all the time. In this movie you have the possibility to see him in every role you can imagine: sad, happy, mad, good, bad, evil incarnated, the best of the angels of God... God himself... don't know... whatever you want, each kind of character in the same role... this is what I've expected from Anthony. This great jobs he made me get accustomed to. The new one star, Colin O'Donoghue, not bad actually, but I was looking for him to react in a lot of scenes, but he didn't let his feeling command himself, is like when a stone is expected to crash, a bomb expected to blow it all, but it doesn't... I can see potential on him but... he need to improve a little. The movie itself has a good script, storytelling, fluently carried. The relation between personal stuff (Colin's character past and so on...) and the present (relation to Father Lucas= Hopkins, and exorcisms, the actual argument where you are put in the entire movie) is one of the greatest I've ever seen, fluent an well-mixed. Good job for me. Don't follow the trends. As I always say."

      "text": "Possibly the most unsettling part of this movie about exorcisms is at the end. We are told that the structural abuse of hapless victims, condoned by the Catholic Church, is not only a continued  practice today,  but is seen as something warranting praise. At least enough to make a movie about it that proclaims such abuse as a good thing. So we are told that one victim was starved of water and food for eight weeks before the devil was driven out. This might be a case of: operation successful; patient died. We aren't offered details. But it is even worse. It isn't just condoned: the Church has actually a list of official exorcists and a training program that teaches this stuff to promising priests.One of those promising priest is our main lead, who is actually a doubting Thomas. Only in this case he is called Michael. Doubting Michael turns priest because, according to him, it is the only other alternative to becoming a mortician. And as Doubting Michael wanted to be away from his parental home, seminary school was the way to go. Believing in the almighty daddy isn't sufficient reason in fact. God doesn't hold any sway in this movie about driving out the devil through abuse.In all irony, the portraying of the opportunistic Michael as agnostic, if not downright as an atheist, who wings it through seminary school backfires as it shows that the Catholic Church is bereft of a functional selection mechanism when picking priests and just about anyone can get A grades and get handpicked for the elite exorcists training course irrespective of the strength of their convictions. But to top it all: the years of seminary school does nothing to sway Doubting Michael one way or the other. He is as unconvinced about the Catholic truth at the end as he is at the start. Seminary school fails to turn doubters into believers. It attest to its utter failure as an institution. The proof is in the pudding.I see something special in you, says some teacher of his, just when the main lead is about to hand in his collar as it was never about becoming a priest. And in the next scene he finds himself signed up to a satan kicker course over in Rome. What that special is(it isn't the fervor of his belief) goes undemonstrated. You might even say that there is more evidence for the contrary as the whole time our hero demonstrates his disbelief. It is like saying that a guy wearing coke-bottle glasses must make an excellent sniper, without showing his accuracy in previous scenes and him refusing to even touch a weapon out of principle. I guess we just believe it without evidence.. shall we? It is what religion is about.Now I can't fault you for thinking that from reading the above that it must be a comedy, but it really isn't. It is nothing more that a straight telling without any mirth. The whole thing is about the exorcisms and the script rushes towards that part and just gives us a cursory nod towards establishing a background and personality for the lead. Since Hopkins  has enough personality upon entry without any need of establishment, the difference between him and the lead is so great that you can drive a truck through it, sideways. Was there anyone else in the room? Or even the picture? Even the extras and the support cast have more personality than Doubting Michael. Of course, we all known that this lack isn't surprising as Michael isn't a real person. He is the stand in for all the doubters and atheists who will become believers overnight when confronted by an 88 mm gun.. eh  the evils of Satan, just like Michael is. There are no atheists in foxholes! Funny enough, at best the movie demonstrates that a being named Ba'al exists. If you take that to be proof that god exists, this is because you have been doggy-trained to make that connection. Turning a believer because of an illogical conclusion or because you are afraid doesn't say anything about existence of the almighty. In rational reality it is more likely that any sane person, whether atheist or not, will prefer to have the victims transported to the nearest decent hospital, Hopkins incarcerated for his own good and that of societies,  and the Catholic Church outlawed until they stop actively supporting this kind of abuse. Like that will be the day!A remarkably disturbing movie that confronts you with the fact that while witch hunts and burning heretics has seen better days, institutional craziness and abuse is still rife in the Catholic Church. It once more shows how well-meaning people can do evil things if they just believe hard enough that their delusion is factual and they have movies telling them so."

The theme has given masterful films (\"The Exorcist\" is the most famous) and this is also very good. The scares are many, but what we see in this film is more suspense, tension, and not exactly scares. The devil is something that never takes shape, you never see, except for the famous mule appears in a single scene, which thickens the suspense: if we are afraid of what we see, we have more fear of what we can not see, of what may be anywhere. The biggest negative review of the film are almost romantic scenes of Kovak and Angeline (Alice Braga), a female journalist, because ultimately create the expectation of a novel, a sub-plot that never happens."
