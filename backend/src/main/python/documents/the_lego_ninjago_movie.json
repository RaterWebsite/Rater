There are a few solid laughs. but the storyline drags, has clunky moral messaging, and the script lacks the subtle flair of other Lego offerings. Sadly, there is little in the plot to necessitate this being a Lego movie, with a lacklustre script, and the various big names seemed to be under utilised as well. The film looks great, and the cat is brilliant, but otherwise this feels like a marketing exercise to sell Ninjago Lego, rather than a polished and clever story that we've come to expect. 4.78/10"

      "text": "With a surprising and touching adventure like The Lego Movie, followed by a funny and self-aware hero flick like The Lego Batman Movie, The Lego Ninjago Movie had a lot of expectations to fulfill, both from fans of the Lego sets and moviegoers. While the film boasts some great animation and a few great laughs, The Lego Ninjago Movie is a fairly disappointing but still fun romp through the ever-expanding Lego film universe. If you were expecting a funny but heartfelt adventure populated by the iconic five (or six, now, I guess) ninja, prepare to have those expectations ruined. Aside from Lloyd and Garmadon, there is little to no screentime or character development for anyone on the roster. Considering how well the other two Lego movies have tackled this, I'm surprised the writers dropped the ball so bad. The main four ninja can't even summon the effort to be one-dimensional. If you can't stand Lloyd and prefer the other ninja instead, this is a movie you can skip. Additionally, the action and animation feel a bit lackluster this time around. Instead of the exciting and spectacular chases in The Lego Movie or the hilarious and epic fights in The Lego Batman Movie, we're left with a few mediocre and rather poorly choreographed battles that can't even manage to be particularly hard-to-follow. Confusingly, the funny and clever smoke, fire, and water animation which utilized Lego bricks instead of simple CGI is gone; rather favoring a simpler animation that looks rather ugly at times. Even some of the landscapes aren't Lego. The story was okay, to be honest. It didn't have the heart of the first Lego film, nor the self-aware but also self-contained humor of the second. But the message got its point across, even if the plot itself was very bare-bones and frustrating at times. Lastly, the jokes in this film rely more on parodies, references, and drawn-out gags a lot more than the first two, making it feel like a crummy Marvel movie. While not completely unfunny, it signals a worrying turn for the future of the Lego Movie franchise."

      "text": "When The LEGO Movie first hit theaters in 2014, audiences weren\u2019t prepared for it\u2019s refreshingly fast-paced, eccentric style of comedy nor its surprisingly emotional third act. Now, three years later, Warner Bros. has begun its first step towards building out this unlikely franchise with The LEGO Batman Movie and, now, The LEGO Ninjago Movie, which hits theaters this weekend. While both films have managed to maintain the same comedic style and emotional themes of the original LEGO Movie, they\u2019ve also both shown signs of how quickly this formula can start to wear thin.Fortunately, The LEGO Ninjago Movie has a different enough backdrop and story to keep it from ever becoming too familiar or boring. Based on the LEGO property of the same name, Ninjago keeps the self-referential and parodical style of its two franchise predecessors, but swaps out the underdog and comic book movie settings of those films for a ninja-themed coming-of-age story. The result is an exuberantly told, if occasionally familiar and comedically uneven, story about a family learning how to come together for the first time.Borrowing the same general plot of the Ninjago TV series, the film takes place in the titular island city where the citizens are left constantly in fear of the frequent destructive takeover attempts by the evil Lord Garmadon (Justin Theroux), a maniacal warlord hellbent on ruling over the city and everyone in it. And when the film begins, the only obstacles in his way are a team of six young ninja, led by Garmadon\u2019s personal archenemy, the mysterious Green Ninja."

I think Lego can answer that with its new movie; The Lego Ninjago Movie and don't misunderstand me, this movie is not a failure in every sense of the word or a disappointment, it is simply that what worked so well in The Lego Movie and The Lego Batman Movie is not present in this one.Yes it does have a good dose of comedy, the animation is still excellent, the movie is entertaining but it does not feel different, it does not feel better, it does not feel like something has advanced especially because the movie never seems to be sure which direction is trying to follow, what we see seems only a succession of gags that lack order.Is it worth it? yes, you can watch it without complications and have a pleasant time but in my personal opinion this entry stayed short and very far from its predecessors."

      "text": "Before delving into the merits of \u201cThe Lego Ninjago Movie,\u201d it\u2019s worth pausing to reflect on just how remarkable it is that the third film in a cinematic franchise based on plastic children\u2019s construction toys comes with high expectations attached. Before Lego launched its own film empire, other toy companies like Hasbro had established assembly lines of often profitable, invariably awful branded theatrical entertainments, and there was no reason to expect anything different from Lego. Yet 2014\u2019s \u201cThe Lego Movie\u201d and last spring\u2019s \u201cThe Lego Batman Movie\u201d surprised just about everyone by being smart, sophisticated, cognizant of their own synergistic origins, and most importantly, actual movies. That the Lego Cinematic Universe (LCU) became a recognizable acronym isn\u2019t surprising; that it came to signify quality is almost miraculous.Superficially, \u201cNinjago\u201d is very much in line with its predecessors. Based on Lego\u2019s ninja-themed original property \u2013 already a Cartoon Network TV show \u2013 the film is a hyperkinetic assault of eye-catching faux stop-motion animation; packed with clever, self-aware, and sometimes boldly absurdist humor; and all anchored by a father-son conflict that the film takes more seriously than is strictly necessary. Yet for the first time, the franchise\u2019s house-style is beginning to show signs of wear. Whereas \u201cThe Lego Movie\u201d and \u201cLego Batman\u201d seemed to come by their cheeky irreverence naturally, the sketchier \u201cNinjago\u201d sometimes strains to keep up the pace, with its anarchic sensibility now having the air of a mandate \u2013 and few tones are harder to maintain than \u201cmandatory irreverence.\u201d Still plenty entertaining and occasionally very funny, \u201cNinjago\u201d nonetheless displays symptoms of diminishing returns, and Lego might want to shuffle its pieces a bit before building yet another film with this same model."

Yes, it's definitely the weakest LEGO installment thus far, but I wouldn't go so far as to call it mediocre, like what many critics and others have been saying so far. I still found it to be quite enjoyable and amusing for the majority of it, and it still has that zany style that the previous two installments employed. But yes, I will admit that it has become a bit formulaic at this point. Nonetheless, it was still an overall enjoyable experience for me, even if it didn't have me laughing out loud too much like 'The Lego Movie' and 'The Lego Batman Movie' did for me."

This is how i would describe the quality of The LEGO Ninjago Movie. A (half) disappointment.Though its quality doesn't make it a true block-buster (just like the wonders of The LEGO Movie or the Bat-giggles of LEGO Batman),there's not that much to talk about issue-wise,given the fact that it's a Warner movie,and they usually have things under control. The plot of this movie is something you most likely don't want to mess with at times,altough it gets confusing,and it HARDLY tries to reach Pixar levels of emotion with its morals. Act 1 felt a bit Batman V Superman-ish tone-wise,but it still managed to be fun,as the jokes rolled in. Getting to the 2nd and 3rd act probably made the movie more energetic,as it was getting more and more interesting. Lloyd and Lord Garmadon luckily do something in the movie,but what about the other charachters (you know,Kai,Zane,Nya,Sensei and the others)? Oh yeah,they're just there to sell some atrocious puns (especially Zane. I get it,he's a robot,but the more puns he was saying,the more i was quickly putting them into Batman And Robin zone. Ever heard of 'Ice is nice'?). There's also a giant cat in some scenes,and that's one of the moments where the audience TRULY bursted out of laughter. And,as i said,the morals were pretty surprising for a kids' flick (yeah,ok,we already saw the 'try and get along with your'...Wait,try living without weapons and wars? A Cars 3-ish moral about being a trainer? Am i looking at Warner Bros. or is this Pixar?!?)The animation is still great,even if you expected it,so yay? Tho,i was disappointed with some pieces of it,like the water and the forest being traditional and only Ninjago City being the only thing filled with LEGO.There are some issues,as i said,with this movie. One of them being the score by Mark Mothersbaugh (SO. OUT. OF. PLACE.) and also the jokes,where it's a hit-or-miss.The LEGO Ninjago Movie is definetly the worst LEGO Movie i saw so far,but that doesn't stop it from having a charming story and some decent jokes,as well as a bright animation. If they don't get The LEGO Movie Sequel right,then this and LEGO Ninjago could potentially be signs of  the apocalypse for the 'now' LEGO Movie Franchise,but for now,let's enjoy our lives."

The sour cherry on the sugarfree cake was the use of non-diegetic objects such as the laser pen and the above-mentioned feline. Number one rule for audience immersion is to not break consistency. And having the real-life cat appearing in an otherwise LEGO-based world (named Legoscope - I see what you did there) is all against the rules of consistency.

Justin Theroux shines all over the movie as Garmadon; the evil lord whose son i.e. Dave Franco as Lloyd, apparently battles against him. But the Jackie Chan here plays as a masterful trump card as Dave Franco's mentor Master Wu who is also the creator of the LEGO world and has a perfect comic timing with some good one-liners. The LEGO Ninjago Movie is barely standing on the script and more on the mockery which leads to the disappointment if taken the previous LEGO movies in account but still it's amusing screenplay and fast pacing won't let you regret any of it.
