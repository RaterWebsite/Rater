The plot is dumb, the characters are bland and boring, and this feels like a bad episode of the power rangers. The Jager pilots look like they are all 13 to 15 years old. No Rolly in this one or Herc. The only reason I am even giving this a 4 and not a zero is the action is ok. Not near as good as the first one though. When Jager fights were not happening in this movie I was zoning out due to Bordem.Really disappointed in this one. It was one of my more anticipated movies for 2018. I would say don't waste your time on it."

      "text": "This movie isn't just an insult to fans of the original, it's an insult to cinema as a whole. Uprising has a completely different aesthetic than it's predecessor and that's not a good thing. The original Pacific Rim was able to feel realistic and captivating, despite it's ridiculous concept. And a lot  of that came from director Guillermo del Toro's commitment to pseudo realism. He can take any ludicrous concept and make it feel real. That's not a common talent, and yet you would expect the director of this sequel, Steven Deknight to at least try his best to replicate that feel. But surprise surprise, he doesn't. This entire movie feels like a cartoon, all sense of scale and weight from the first movie are thrown out the window in favor of cartoonish antics which pull you out of the narrative. Most of the Jeager Pilots in this movie are literal teenagers, showing just how little the filmmakers cared about the original movie. This film was designed by focus groups, not artists, and it reflects very poorly on the final product. To make it even worse, the film feels like it was designed to ruin the universe the first movie established. One of the main characters in the first film has been reduced to a villain for no reason, but that's not nearly as bad as how this piece of trash then decides it would be a good idea to cram one of the leads in the first movie into the first act, have them show no emotion or semblance of character, and then kill them off, and act like it was nothing.Finally, the action is just useless. There is more of it in this one than the original, but there is no effort put into its' choreography. Fights are slow paced and uncreative, there are no distinctive weapons or abilities used, (none that mean anything anyway). There is no effort put into making any of the hits feel strong or impactful,the fights aren't nearly as visceral or captivating as the first one's. All around this is an abysmal movie with no redeeming qualities, anything that looks good in this garbage heap has been done better by other movies."

It has a simple plot, very young protagonists, a cute robot, basic morals, if you have some age on your shoulders you'll forsee every dialogue and situation of this flick. Battles are more flashy than the first film but are soulless, hollow, linear. It is sad to see enormous robots armed with nonsense weapons jumping all around like ninja (causing more colleateral damage than the monsters)....unlike the first one where you can feel the weights of monsters and mechs. Kaiju are veeeery scarce in this movie and have generic look and silly motivation. It is missing the love letter for vintage kaiju films or anime robot of the first installation. If you'll go to the teatre with childer they will have a good time but otherwise you can skip it"

Yes you get some hints on the why of the first movie, but it takes way too much time establishing the new characters and too much language translations. The visuals were pretty good and easily the fun aspect of the movie. The lack of an established movie star, was maybe a bad decision. And turning a previous fun/comedic character into the main villain isn't a good move at all. So yes, the mechanics works but the essence doesn't make that thing run very far. I give it a 55% because this movie seems to setup a follow up. Will we see it is another question..."

But then all the usual giant-robot combat ensues, and it wears thin rather quickly... why is that pre-teen girl able to build giant robots all by herself?  I never understood that... or any of dozens of other examples of far-fetched silliness that's taken for granted here.Really the best part of this eye-roller is the names of the giant Jaeger robots... \"November Ajax\" etc.  Definitely good stuff for 8-year olds to get into and then buy the plastic model kits..."

      "text": "Pacific Rim: Uprising goes full Hollywood with this poorly executed sequel. If you are hoping this film is better than the first, you'll be disappointed as the only real appeal to this film is the unrealistic physics of Yager Combat.The story leads a linear path and diverges into multiple complex situations that, if any of the characters were smart enough, could fix quite easily. The climax, although different in a way, gets to a point where the movie seems to keep falling from that point on and has no real return. So many plots are unrealistic and so many decisions the writers chose made this film a little bit more unbearable each minute.The only real positives are John Boyega's strong acting, Yager Design and, of course, the Kaiju, who are somehow back, and explained very briefly.If there are plans for another movie, let's hope anyone who writes it has a chance to develop a good story, with stronger acting and making the Yager combat as realistic as possible."

Copping out at every turn and displaying a complete lack of trust in its audience, the script to this sequel immediately devolves into spelling out everything that its viewers need to know (either through blunt voiceovers or on-the-nose dialogue). This sets the tone for the entire movie as we\u2019re exposed to every clich\u00e9 in the book (an exhausted plot line and flat supporting characters) as well as inattentive techniques (negligent pacing, transitions and effects). There may be some thrilling fights and the cool monsters but the entire ride rings hollow all the way through.While the design and potential of Pacific Rim: Uprising may have many wanting to give it a shot, its void of substance limits the film  to only the shallowest of successes. In the vain of Transformers or the Fast & Furious franchise, this film has oodles of popcorn appeal and a major absence of craft or distinction. Pacific Rim: Uprising is fun at times but, just like its over-indulgent action sequences, the film is wholly unoriginal and bordering on insulting.Writing: 4/10Direction: 4/10Cinematography: 4/10Acting: 4/10Editing: 4/10Sound: 6/10Score/Soundtrack: 5/10Production Design: 7/10Casting: 6/10Effects: 7/10Overall Score: 5.1/10Original Articles: https://thefilmguys.blog/reviews/augusts-reviews/pacific-rim-uprising-2018/"

This time jaeger move around like a sheet of paper blow by tornado wind. Action happen so fast that they should create sonic boom and destroy everything around it. Watching this movie is like watching physic(cally) torture movie. Another insult to the injury is the jaeger designs.

Being completely honest, it looks like a movie made for little kids, with characters that would only be appealing for little kids (like 8-10 years old). They lose a massive amount of time in ridiculous dialogs and cliche plot roles.Oh... and, there is an ENORMOUS plot hole between this movie and the first one that is never explained. You can see that the change of directors (del Toro does not direct this one) hurt the movie. The mecha fights were non-appealing, they completely break the laws of physics and were overall lame. The Kaijus are like completely secondary... in a Kaiju movie.So, in general... if you wanna see some mechs punch each other and with little to non-Kaiju action, and you don't care about writing and interesting characters, go see. If you want the opposite, just keed your memories of the first movie."

There's none of his visual inventiveness or compelling storytelling. The first half wastes time setting up relationships with uninteresting characters (headed by John Boyega). After suffering thru that, there's an extended, noisy battle of giant robots vs. a creature from the deep and an evil machine. There's destruction is so massive and repetitive that it quickly devolves into a dull roar. I didn't love the first one and I absolutely hated this one."

      "text": "Pacific Rim: Uprising is a big letdown for fans of the first movie.Whereas the original movie inspired awe in its spectacle, and even some of its characters engaged the audience, this light-hearted sequel is boring and its cast fails to engage the viewer. The absence of Charlie Hunnam, the protagonist from the first film, is a big negative.Sure there are some pretty CGI effects but nothing you haven't seen in Michael Bay's Transformers movies already. The only cool thing in Pacific Rim: Uprising is a plot twist regarding a traitor, but they spoilt it by making it obvious so early that it didn't pay off at all.The movie just brims with bad ideas and even worse execution. For starters the main mecha is named Gipsy Avenger (as in, Marvel's Avengers?). Next, 3 biological beings combine into a bigger one with the help of thousands of little machines that glued them together, as if the Constructicons appeared out of nowhere and combined into Devastator. The writers also made poor attempts at character development for all 10 Jaeger pilots when the focus should be on just 2 or 3 of them. And how about the sub-plot with the Kaiju's blood being excellent rocket fuel? There is an even dumber idea regarding the masterplan of the alien invaders, but I won't spoil it here. Lastly but not least, in the mid-credits they also tease a 3rd movie which should bring the fight to the aliens' homeworld. LOLI am very disappointed with Pacific Rim: Uprising, and this is one of the very few movies I regret watching in cinema. I'd rather watch a sequel to the newest Power Rangers movie."
