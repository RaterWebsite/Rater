Et si les responsables sont tout d\u00e9sign\u00e9s, \u00e0 savoir nos **** copains les requins, \u00e7a ne le d\u00e9range pas plus que \u00e7a !Des requins g\u00e9n\u00e9tiquement modifi\u00e9s, plus rapides, plus forts, plus intelligents : les requins qui valaient trois milliards. Ils peuvent nager en marche arri\u00e8re, font des cr\u00e9neaux et tapent le z\u00e9ro \u00e0 100 en 3 secondes. Ils sont trois et la jouent collectif : une vraie \u00e9quipe de foot.Ne tournons pas autour du pot : ce n'est pas aussi d\u00e9bile qu'un Sharknado mais presque... A force d'en faire des tonnes, Renny fait perdre toute cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 son film... Cela \u00e9tant, c'est ind\u00e9niablement dr\u00f4le de voir ces crevards se faire bouffer les uns apr\u00e8s les autres et se prendre des trombes d'eau dans la gueule. Apr\u00e8s un temps d'exposition syndical, le film ne marque par ailleurs aucun temps mort, \u00e0 part les morts !Les acteurs ne sont l\u00e0 que pour sonner la cloche du d\u00e9je\u00fbner. On notera tout de m\u00eame la tr\u00e8s charmante Safron burrows, une belle fille fort int\u00e9ressante que j'avais remarqu\u00e9 dans l'abominable nanar spatial Wing Commander.En tout cas, Renny sait toujours filmer et n'a pas perdu la main : un vrai pop-corn."

      "text": "Deep Blue Sea. This is got to be something that I've check out as a kid but didn't watch it all the way through but certainly interest me. Before I've heard of Jaws, this is the one I've heard of and the death scenes really interests me and I know exactly were it begins. Yes, my favourite part is where Jim got his arm bitten off by a shark. I just can't stop thinking about it. The opening scene is something that you'd expect from a horror slasher flick. I'm even surprised that Samuel L. Jackson's been killed by a shark. The special effects of the sharks are made of animatronics and computer generated effects and some of which are pretty decent. Some of them don't age well like the CGI of the way sharks look and some of them look good like you will see what you'll see. It's not the best film I've seen in years but enjoyable for what it is and Jaws is still to this day my favourite film of all time considering a great film of all time. Deep Blue Sea really does have those sequences of sharks and it didn't scare me and that's really about it."

      "text": "While it may not have the brains of Steven Spielberg's \"Jaws,\" this shark flick more than makes up for it with big thrills and all out fun. I feel like Deep Blue Sea doesn't get enough credit. There's a lot of good stuff going on here. The kills are great and often surprising. Renny Harlin shoots his shark attack scenes like traditional horror movie scares. We've seen these tricks used before, but they're much more effective here because it's sharks instead of apparitions.The cast is fantastic. Usually when a rapper steps into acting scene it's usually just to much things up. This is especially true with horror movies. However, LL Cool J proves to be an exception here. His character is one of the best parts. Simultaneously funny and someone you can root for. Samuel Jackson is excellent as always. This may not seem like the kind of movie where he would be allowed to flex his acting muscles, but he is given one of his more memorable monologues here. It serves as a reminder of just how talented he is at commanding the screen and taking hold of the viewers attention. Essentially, it's another reminder of why Jackson is one of the greats. It Thomas Jane who steals the show though by nailing the does-everything action hero role and adding some masculine sex appeal to the mix. He's all around awesome and Deep Blue Sea stands out as one of his best movies/roles.The plot may be a bit absurd, but stands to give viewers a great setting for underwater mishaps. Renny Harlin knows how to craft tension in his scenes. It's more than just sharks causing these characters problems. Their sea-based facility proves to be a crumbling death trap. The strength of the movie comes from just how exciting and enjoyable it is to watch the likable cast try to escape with their lives and dodge sharks in the process. At the end of the day, isn't that what you want from a movie like this? I know I do.Deep Blue Sea is a blast. Well-made, deceptively clever, and a whole lot of fun. It works as an action movie and serves as a decent (if unscary) horror movie as well. There's a lot more going on here than one would additionally think. It might all be of the cheap thrill variety, but it's hard to criticize the movie for that when it does everything so well. As it stands this might just be second only to the legendary Jaws in terms of shark movies. It's seemingly got it all. Provided what you're looking for is people getting chomped. Which is kind of the point of most shark movies, don't you think?9.2/10"

A doctor and her team of researchers looking to find a cure for Alzheimer's in sharks in an isolated facility in the middle of an ocean - what more do you need for some sweet chaos while also supported by some unethical practices? Deep Blue Sea is not the most realistic shark film out there but it has a lot of cool action, suspense, the added pleasure of flooding sequences, and a protagonist that you love to hate. Go for it. (Grade B-). TN."

      "text": "Deep Blue Sea (1999) is a movie directed by Renny Harlin starring\rSamuel L. Jackson, LL Cool J and Michael Rapaport. It's a shark based\rthriller with a twist that also makes it somewhat a sci-fi movie. It's\rimpossible to compare with the shark parodies made recently, but it's\ralso not like the previously released shark classics such as \u201eJaws\".\r The whole action happens on a floating facility used as a test lab to\rfind a cure for Alzheimer's disease. The medicine is being created from\rthe brain of sharks, which are kept in special cages to prevent them\rfrom breaking out. Which of course happens, it wouldn't be a thriller\rif everything went fine throughout the movie. Chaos breaks out in the\rfacility when a shark attacks an employer and they manage to escape. It\rturns out the sharks where genetically mutated to be 5 time smarter\rthan any other animal. The crew, all by themselves, must survive the\rshark attacks, and think of a strategy end this.\r Starting from the main \u201eactors\" in the movie, the sharks' visual\reffects are awful, in my opinion, the robotic shark from \u201eJaws\" looks\rmuch better. They are poorly made and all of the action regarding them\rlooks entirely fake, with blurry and stiff movements. Which ruins\ralmost the entire movie (as far as visuals go) because they are the key\relement.\r The real good actor worth mentioning here is LL Cool J (Preacher) who\ris the cook of the facility. He still manages to make a side character\rone of the most interesting and comic ones. He is the only reason why\rthis movie is watchable. Other scenes are either boring with no energy,\rpredictable or look totally fake\r If you wanna watch a shark classic i would much rather recommend \u201eJaws\"\rby Steven Spielberg. It's better in all aspects."
