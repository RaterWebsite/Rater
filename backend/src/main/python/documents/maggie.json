I think that Maggie has a least four excellent performances. The best is definitely Abigail Breslin. It is Arnold Schwarzenegger who is going to bring people to the theatre to see this movie but it really is Breslin's film, she is really the star. Schwarzenegger however is not his normal self. The man can act, and I'm sure that this film will never receive the credit it should because Schwarzenegger is in it and people are too quick to judge it by its cover. Maggie is slow but the performances managed to keep me interested. The film is also dark which perfectly captures its tone. I think that people need to go into this movie with an unbiased mind and it could really be enjoyed."

Arnie plays a father who shows his daughter love, devotion, trust and dignity after she is bitten and infected with a virus that will eventually turn her into a zombie like state, Where everyone else pretty much gives up on her he refuses to. Abigail Breslin plays Maggie as a teenager who accepts her fate without any outlandish behavior and just wants to be with family when the end comes, Her father is the only real family she has left. Breslin is outstanding in this role, she reminded me a lot of my own daughter which is probably why it hit me so hard. If the movie concentrated on just these two and trimmed maybe 10 to15 min I would have given this movie a 10"

      "text": "I liked this film, and I really wish I could give it a higher score.\r The script is terrific, exploring the overdone zombie genre uniquely as a heart-wrenching family drama. The film focuses on both a father's anguish at having to choose the ultimate fate of his terminally ill daughter, as well as the young girl's struggle to face her impending death on her own terms.\r The performances are terrific, surprisingly, since I don't usually associate Arnold Schwarzenegger with art-house acting showcases like this. The aging action hero does as good a job as anyone has a right to expect him to, and his face is well-suited for the somber material. Abigail Breslin outshines him, of course, with an amazing performance assisted in no small part by a top-notch makeup department.\r Unfortunately it's Director Henry Hobson, making his feature film debut, who keeps the movie from being everything it should have been. With his shaky, handheld shots and dingy orange-gray palette he's obviously trying to thread the needle between artsy and scary, but he doesn't pull either off particularly well. To be perfectly frank, sometimes I have no idea what he's aiming the camera at.\r If you can stand the uneven quality of the direction, and you love both zombie films and melancholic character pieces, this is a must-watch. Otherwise, I'd wait until it pops up on Netflix."

      "text": "f the audience goes into this movie thinking Arnold is going to be fighting zombies and killing bad guys, they will be extremely disappointed. Maggie is simply a father-daughter drama, taking place in an apocalyptic world with not much else going on.\rThe film revolves around the character \u201cMaggie\u201d played by actress Abigail Breslin (Little Miss Sunshine, Zombieland) who is infected with a deadly virus that eventually transforms her into a zombie. Then we have veteran actor, Arnold Schwarzenegger (The Terminator, Predator) who plays the caring father who tries his best to help his infected daughter until the end.\rAs for the film, not a lot goes on or happens, other than Arnold and Abigail\u2019s characters attempting to have quality time, and engage in conversations that the audience did not care for.\rThe film does a horrible job at keeping the audience interested and engaged while also lending a depressing tone or feel that ultimately allows the audience to feel unconnected with the characters.  I\u2019m not saying that all movies need to have action or a predominantly jolly and happy tone to it, but if they do choose a depressing tone, there should be a better effort on their part to establish deeper connections amongst the characters. The film \u201cMaggie\u201d had my peers and I feeling quite relieved when it was finally over.\rIn conclusion, this is a film that had a lot of potential to be great, but sadly falls short of that.  On a positive note, the film had originality and a brand new take on the zombie genre.  Other than that, nothing special here.\r Final Score: 3/10"

      "text": "Maggie is a film that was marketed as a slow drama with zombies. It turned out to be a pretty good slow drama that had a fresh take on the zombie apocalypse story we all know. It is widely disliked for not being an action-packed piece of crap with Arnold Schwarzenegger cracking one-liners constantly like they all thought it was going to be. If someone could explain that to me, that would be great.\r But seriously, Maggie is a pretty good little film, not perfect, but pretty good. It surprised me with it's simplicity and nice cinematography, as well as the acting. Arnold actually gives a very good performance as a father who has to deal with his daughter slowly becoming something else, and knowing he will have to do something about it. But this is Abigail Breslin's movie. She was VERY good as the title character. Joely Richardson was also pretty good as her step-mother. The direction was pretty good by first timer Henry Hobson, and I really liked how some of the shots were set up. Really, my only complaint is that the dialogue could have been touched up some. But overall, Maggie is a nice little slower drama with horror overtones, and a welcome lower-key take on the zombie genre. Without giving anything away, I think the ending was perfect."

Henry Hobson has done justice to Arnold fans, and given him the role of his lifetime. I can compare Maggie to my favourite video game, The Last Of Us. The result is haunting, suspenseful, terrifying and thrilling, every moment was crackling with suspense, an eerie quietness and powerhouse performances and emotions. Wade knows that Maggie will die, but he stays close to her till her last breath. Maggie captures the relationship between a father and her daughter masterfully. It's dark and scary, and meets the requirements of a zombie outbreak and its effect hits home. Maggie deserves a staring ovation. It's brilliantly written, sharply directed, masterfully acted and well executed. Take your father to watch this one, it's a love letter to all fathers in the whole world. Being a father himself, Schwarznegger beautifully captures a role of a father struggling to help his daughter before she turns into the things he most hates. Maggie deserves to be watched. 10/10."

      "text": "A slow-paced, emotional look at the effects of the zombie apocalypse. By focusing on one girl's transformation and the effect it has on her and those around her during a time when the world isn't completely ravaged by the undead, director Henry Hobson and writer John Scott III create a compelling world and effective tale. Even better is that it is brought to life by fantastic performances from it's two leads.\r One would think Arnold Schwarzenegger in a zombie movie would be a straight up zombie killing good time given the actor's pedigree. This movie is something wildly different though and Arnold shows just how great of a performance he can give. His emotions are real. It's both shocking and exciting to see the hero of countless action movies nail this dramatic performance. Abigail Breslin is just as fantastic. She really brings the process of turning into a zombie to life. She plays each stage of the change perfectly.\r The writing is just strong all around here. Characters act like real people and their dialog is believable. It's a treat for drama fans and for zombie fans who are interested in more emotional tales. So what's the catch? Unfortunately it is a very slow movie. It carries a very solemn tone. Perhaps too solemn. Characters wander around with their heads and act really glum. I mean, I get that this is a drama, but at times all this sadness can kind of suck the life out of the parts of the film. Luckily though it's not too bad, but the slow-moving melancholy nature of it all will turn off some viewers.\r \"Maggie\" is a powerful drama that provides an interesting take on the well-worn zombie motif. It's fresh and plenty emotional. Many might not be able to get past the pace and tone of the film, but those that can will be treated to a great tale and some incredible performances. It's not the zombie film you watch if you are looking for action. It's the one you watch if you are looking for some tears."

Despite the growing threat she represents, her father will defy both the risk and the authorities in order to protect her.\r Every since I first heard the news of Arnold Schwarzenegger in a zombie drama movie with Abigail Breslin I was sold already by the thought of it and the trailer for the movie helped a lot. I think it was about time for a movie starring zombies in it to be a deep drama I mean it would be interesting to see more then the goof over the top zombie movies that we always get. Now after seeing Maggie I was a little bit disappointed but there are a lot to like when it comes to positives.\r I know Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't the greatest actor on the planet but he is likable in real life and in movies, I mean I can you not like the guy his like the best worst thing to happen to cinema. Arnold in this movie actually pulled off a good performance, his wasn't just playing himself or doing one liners, he actually did a good and serious performance and it worked.\r Abigail Breslin also did a great performance in this movie playing the teenager slowly turning into a zombie and in the movie you see her turning and the effect's it has on her and her father is truly heartbreaking to watch, and her performance sold it for me.\r The chemistry between Arnold Schwarzenegger and Abigail Breslin was just spot on brilliant. They performances really helped me to buy into the father and daughter thing and it payed off so well because they are scenes in this movie were it was so sad to watch when it cuts to the two of them having a talk about their past life and how worried they both are.\r The movie was shot beautifully, the writing was okay for the most part, the directing was good and the Arnold and Abigail were the only thing that kept me watching till the very end.\r Now for problems: These a scene in this movie were Abigail character see's this boy the same age as her who's also infected and the two of them have a little love triangle and I didn't really care about. The scene it self could have been cut out of the movie as the scene and the boy never get brought up again.\r The ending to the movie just kind of ended just like that. I already thought of a better and more sad ending to the movie but since I'm keeping this a spoiler free review (For the most part) I just thought the movie ended at the wrong time and could have ended better.\r Overall Maggie was a okay movie with two solid performances from Arnold and Abigail."

There is no action and there is very little gore, its not a horror as such. Now my personal opinion. Lots of new going on in this film, i normally don't like Drama's but i am glad i gave this one a go. Acting is brilliant, the story is brilliant but slow, it's atmosphere paced and very touching. Very different take on a zombie apocalypse. Arnold's acting was brilliant and very surprising, Not massive dialogues, but enough, with the expressions and portrayal, Arnold did well. Everyone else in this movie also made it happen, nothing was flawed and it all came together well. Now it is slow and i was tempted to skip forward here and there but i stuck with it until the end and i am glad i did. It leaves a mark on you. Go into this movie expecting only a drama based in the zombie world and a whole new side to Arnold and you will appreciate it. Once again Drama's not my thing and Arnold's usual work is more to my taste, but i appreciated everything in this film, so on that perspective, il give it a 8.5/10. Its a shame people have not judged the film correctly. Nearly all Negative reviews say \"Bah where's the gore\", \"bah no action\" or \"Bah i hate Arnie\". If you see reviews involving anything similar to that... they have not watched it knowing what they were about to watch or are bigoted."

To overtly put, Maggie has breathed some new life into the tired zombie sub-genre.\r The film opens with the same bleak impact that Charlton Heston introduced in \u2018The Omega Man\u2019 (Sagal, 1971) as Wade, played convincingly by renowned action icon Arnold Schwarzenegger, drives through the depressing post-apocalypse as the once beautiful countryside burns its last breath, gradually unveiling the pandemic that is ripping society apart. Wade is searching for his missing daughter, Maggie (Abigail Breslin) and manages to track her down at a hospital, where he\u2019s abruptly informed of the non-curable infection she has contracted and is given a limited timeframe with his daughter, per the government ruling on the outbreak.\r This zombie virus doesn\u2019t turn victims into rotten, flesh hungering undead corpses within hours or days; it\u2019s a painstaking terminal illness that emotionally deteriorates the victim and the family and close friends unit suffering intensely. The hopelessness of watching a loved one gradually succumb to an incurable illness is displayed here with such honest depth, which also correlates to the disease that will eventually rip humanity into ruin.\rArnold gives the best performance of his career as a simple, every-day man wracked with the pain of watching his daughter descend into her illness. Wade clearly feels he\u2019s failed his own daughter and as she is dying, the last connection to his deceased wife is fading. Arnold\u2019s comeback to filmmaking hasn\u2019t been kind (the box office returns have been underwhelming and reviews mixed) but Maggie paints him in a different, mature light. Abigail Breslin anchors the film as the title character, witnessing her own body turn against her as the disease distorts her humanity. The necrosis make-up effects are shocking and heightened even more as Maggie twists into an emotional wreck at each instance of the virus closing down her mortality.\r The whole ordeal is punctuated by cinematographer Lukas Ettlin, who opts for a subtle yet realistic, intimate style, and the abundance of \u2018shaky-cam\u2019 shots gives the constant sense of disruption; you feel Wade\u2019s life tearing apart, a poignant metaphor for the film\u2019s world. The post-apocalyptic iconography that this sub-genre is so accustomed to is represented differently, relying on emotional impact rather than stylistic awe. The colours are faded and there are deep shadows peering over, the unknown taking hold. The zombie make-up effects are less traditional, with deep black cuts and gore unwinding. The scene where Wade encounters the reanimated father and daughter is textually abhorrent, with punctured eyes and near skull-like decay.\r But unlike other zombie films, these wandering corpses are given profiles and backstories, as Wade\u2019s action on dispatching these meandering carcasses faces the realisation of their surviving family which mirrors Wade\u2019s own turmoil. Schwarzenegger is able to demonstrate certain depth he has acquired over the years in one heartrending scene as he visits the house of the zombies he just killed to discover desperate carvings on the wall that read \u2018Love my daughter, love my family\u2019. Little sub-plots like these reinforce the main thread and builds up anxiety; every cause has an effect.\r Henry Hobson has made a unique and strong debut in his first feature-length director effort. To be able to twist genres and turn tired conventions into a dramatic fusion takes skill and craft, and Hobson has proved himself and paved the way for a promising future ahead. The script for Maggie, written John Scott 3, spent years on the Hollywood black list, garnering a positive reputation before the cameras started rolling.\r The zombie sub-genre always works best when there is something else going on underneath and Maggie is no exception; quantifying a worldwide outbreak to just a small group of characters and watching their lives fall is all the more effective. It becomes more personalised and the audience can sympathise.\r Maggie comes highly recommended for audiences who are looking for a different type of flesh to chew on."

I grew up watching Arnie blow stuff up, be a twin, dress up as Turboman, but Maggie is without a doubt his best performance.  The macabre undertone of 1 of 3 impending outcomes would be more than enough to push anyone to the breaking point, and Arnie hits the nail dead center on the head.  Brav-effing-o."

      "text": "First, I have to clarify this... Maggie is a human drama. Period. If you are expecting it to be anything else(an action movie or a horror movie or maybe even a zombie movie), this is not the movie that you are looking for. I know it sounds like I'm exaggerating, but I'm certainly not.\rIn this movie, zombies are just an element of the story, not the main opposition that Schwarzenegger has to fight against with a machine gun in his hand.  They are depicted as some kind of contagious disease that slowly takes people's souls and turn them into dangerous creatures. So this movie is more about the disease and families who are torn apart by the disease, not about the zombies themselves.\rOverall, this human drama(I have to emphasize this) is brilliant and emotional with a beautiful soundtrack, artistic cinematography, and great performances. And the first-time screenwriter John Scott 3 did an amazing job, and I'm really looking forward to his next work."

Maggie lurches a bit clumsily at times, but is partially redeemed by strong performances and an unexpectedly thoughtful tone. I'll give Maggie a B-."

      "text": "I have seen a few lower ratings on the internet before watching this movie, may be that's the reason I liked this film, the expectation was too low. To my surprise this film is not bad at all. As we all know, Arnold may not be so great in character roles, but everyone loves him. In this film you can see a different Arnold, very controlled acting to his best. The film is a very touching drama, mixed in horror. The bond between a father and daughter is the backbone of the story. It's worth watching, not bad at all. The film deserves a better rating for a reason."
