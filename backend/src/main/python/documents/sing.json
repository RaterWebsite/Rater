      "text": "The animation and visual look of \"Sing\" is excellent.  The story is simple, but not altogether predictable.  Not sure what the moral of the movie is, but I guess it would be to follow your dream no matter what.  If you're going to have a really simple story, then you should make the movie as funny as possible.  That's where the film fails for me.  I didn't laugh all that much.  It tries hard to be funny, and may succeed with small children, but not so much for adults.  The strangest part of the film is the Mom pig who creates an automated system for taking care of her large family while she is at rehearsals.  In a single night she creates a majorly complex auto feed, auto laundry system that would make NASA proud.  She needs to be an inventor, not a singer.  Not a horrible film, but could have been better."

The story was interesting, the songs were good, etc. My problems with the movie was the fact that \"Dream On\" was played in the trailer, but it was not in the movie. That is annoying. The other problem I had was the plot seemed to go all over the place. It's a good family movie to see this holiday season, but do not expect it to be quality like Secret Life of Pets or Despicable Me."

On the bright side, the music is enjoyable and the film does not even try to address social or political themes, which is absolutely not necessary."

      "text": "Sing is a movie that lures with the promise of being a modern day jukebox musical but ends up being a complete waste of time. Illumination was looking for another great hit since the only great movie they have been able to make was Despicable Me, but this wasn't it by long shot. It's not funny, unless you are two year old, and there are way to many characters to focus on. Thus every character in this film comes off as one dimensional and boring. with one exception, Johnny  the Gorilla. The only other good part about this movie is the ending scene which is when, shock of all shock, the characters actually preform full musical numbers. you see in the majority of the film we don't get full musical numbers just pits of the characters singing. Which, for a movie called Sing is a shame. In conclusion this movie is terrible if your looking for good Jukebox musical go check out Rock of Ages and stay far away from this pile of crap."

      "text": "The only good things Illumination \"Sing\" gives us are: Good action, animation, and story basis.  Other than that, Sing is a rushed movie on so many aspects.  One being that the whole story changes because of something so stupid and unrealistic (an eyeball falling out of a lizards head), they should have put more thought into that. Another being that they use animals instead of humans, and they don't even act like Animals.  Disney's \"Zootopia\" at least follows the basis that they are still animals, even though they are basically human, they still have animal traits that have a roll on the story of Zootopia, Sing falls short in that.  The characters really feel bland and not interesting and hard to love.  Sing is one movie that is very forgettable and Illumination better pick up their act soon or just stick to Despicable Me, and even that they can't do.  Sorry, but Sing is not for me at all, and it's a very bad movie thats hard to even enjoy."

One can perfectly identify with the characters and the proposal is great entertainment for the whole family. The dubbing is fine, it could have been better with real Actors of Dubs. The best thing about the movie is the soundtrack and it makes you sing it. The bad: few gags and the predictable and full of clich\u00e9s that is the plot (above the trailer tells you everything). Entertaining, it makes you laugh and thrill. A very good experience for the family."

      "text": "A Touching and Moving Animal American IdolIn 2007, Christopher \"Chris\" Meledandri, the founder and current CEO of Illumination Entertainment, founds his own animation film production company after having been President of 20th Century Fox Animation and supervised and produced movies such as \"Ice Age\", its sequel \"Ice Age: The Meltdown\", among others. Three years later, \"Despicable Me\" seeps in worldwide movie show-times as a joyful, energetic and mostly invigorating feature film. Since then, the company has been rising, collecting recognition and purification which are credited to its works. With discrepant spin-offs, sequels, and original ideas, they've been working on providing an annual film, and while 2011 didn't release any new project, they challenge themselves this year like the major studios with two films filled with magic, spirit, and exultation. After \"The Secret Life of Pets\" of Chris Renaud and Yarrow Cheney, arrives the seventh one and the first animated musical of the Universal Pictures section. The factory shows clearly conviction deposited in its product, since it has been a pretty competitive year in the matter, and even story lines of this film have been outlined in other projects, putting it at great risk around to the unpleasant and subjective paradigms. However, there are inexplicably films of which you cannot hate, even though you know that something goes wrong, well this is the case.In a universe where humans are substituted by animals, it's ordinary to glimpse a giraffe jogging, a lizard talking or a zebra cooking. In this domesticated world is set Buster Moon (Matthew McConaughey), a koala owner of a fluctuating theater which is falling apart due to the almost non-existent income. He hopes to become a virtuoso host and rebuilds the theater, which his father bequeathed him; so announces a singing competition without restrictions or impediments, anyone who considers that can hum has the possibility of auditing in the proscenium. After a grueling knockout round, there are five shortlisted contenders to fight for the tempting award, a prize that has been altered by mistake. The finalists are intended to be a heterogeneous group: Rita (Reese Witherspoon), a housewife and mother of 25 piglets should be related a lover pop culture pig, Gunter (Nick Kroll); an egotistical and individualistic small mouse, Mike (Seth Macfarlane); a teenage elephant with stage panic, Meena (Tori Kelly); a young bouncer who wants categorically a different tomorrow from his family gives him, Johnny (Taron Egerton) and a rocker porcupine with an amorous deception, which impels her to emerge as a soloist; Ash (Scarlett Johansson). Around these plots, the story succumbs in well-known territories, however, it comes out unscathed thanks to the thoughtful and authentic connection with their characters; a story that finds its main propellant in the wonderful inspiration.In times where scrupulousness for accuracy and concentration for detail ruled in \"Zootopia\" or \"Kubo and the Two Strings\", many people consider that the film does not take hold in visual terms regarding its predecessors, placing emphasis repeatedly in the facial gestures scarcity and poor worked textures, however, contrary to what many declares, I encounter this one even more effective since they put the organic aside for going deeper in significant features for development, it should be noted that the above does not mean that the movie perishes visually, it's gorgeous on the essentials; but evidently dissimilar against its competitors. It's noteworthy that Illumination has joined the trend of concealing different easter eggs among its films in order to generate a kind of not confirmed interconnection among them, clearly highlighting the masks used by gorillas in the robberies, the iconic and unforgettable face of Snowball of \"The Secret Life of Pets\".Music is a vital issue, therefore they inject covers of 65 different artists, which ranging from Ariana Grande's low notes to the exquisite polyphony of Frank Sinatra. Katy Perry, Kanye West, Sam Smith, The Beatles, Beyonce, Lady Gaga and Nicki Minaj lead the melodic lists artfully personified, linked and adorned by particularly humorous circumstances. In addition to this, the film also conceived two own songs: \"Faith\", performed by Stevie Wonder and Ariana Grande and \"Set it All Free\" sung by incredible Johansson.The last card of the ascending study is an uplifting, noticeably touching and fertile in laughs reality show that will return you the hope of finding simple films with teachings so important. With animation standards of the seventh art in these days, \"Sing\" may not be an aesthetic pearl, but who longs for sensational animals and computerized voices when you have Taron Egerton singing to the dreams, to Scarlett Johansson as a mother and model or to Mathew McConaughey keeping alive the illusion of dreaming and fighting; any human being would swap one thing for other."

The use of songs in this movie is just terrible; they use almost every overused song in movies out of the book. The song use is so terrible I was actually able to predict three of the songs that would play next! It's an offense to music and just barely not an offense to film. Just bleh."

      "text": "In a world of anthropomorphic animals, optimistic koala Buster Moon (Matthew McConaughey) is the owner of a music theater, having been interested in show-business ever since his father took him to his first music show when he was a child. His assistant is a slightly senile green iguana named Ms. Karen Crawley (Garth Jennings), who has a glass eye (which pops out at times). Lately, Buster's theater is in financial trouble due to showing productions that have bombed, and his theater is in danger of closing down. Buster tells his friend, Suffolk sheep Eddie Noodleman (John C. Reilly), that he will try and save his theater from closure by hosting a singing competition, with the prize being $1000, despite having only random stuff in his briefcase.Buster isn't the only one in a crisis, as other animals in the city have issues of their own. Rosita (Reese Witherspoon) is a talented singer, but has given up her dreams of performing to raise 25 unruly children and is constantly neglected by her workaholic husband, Norman (Nick Offerman). Meena (Tori Kelly) has a great singing voice, but has severe stage fright, causing her pushy grandfather (Jay Pharoah) to pressure her to face her fear. Mike (Seth MacFarlane) is a street musician who plays the saxophone but doesn't make easy money, prompting him to threaten people into giving him cheap profits. Johnny (Taron Egerton) is the son of mobster Big Daddy (Peter Serafinowicz) who wants him to follow in his criminal footsteps, but Johnny aspires to be a singer. Punk-rocker Ash (Scarlett Johansson) is in a band with her boyfriend Lance (Beck Bennett) who is critical of her rocking style.While printing fliers for the competition, Ms. Crawley's glass eye causes her to accidentally print $100,000 as the prize money instead of $1,000. Before the fliers can be checked, they are accidentally blown out of Buster's office drawing lots of candidates around the city including Johnny, Meena, Ash, Rosita, and Mike. After holding auditions with a turnout greater than expected, Buster picks Mike, Johnny, Rosita, Ash, and a few others to be in the contest. Meena's stage fright causes her to bomb her audition, Lance is dismissed from the contest when he auditions with Ash, and Rosita is partnered with another pig contestant named Gunther (Nick Kroll) to be in a dancing routine. Soon enough, Buster discovers Ms. Crawley's error when Eddie shows him the flier, but instead of telling the contestants of the mistake and of the true prize of $1,000, he tries to get enough money for the promised reward.Convinced by her grandfather, Meena tries to get Buster to give her another audition, but due to some technical difficulties, she is hired as a stage hand instead. After some of the animals quit, Rosita, Mike, Johnny, Gunther, Ash, and (eventually) Meena are the only ones left in the show. However, their individual problems begin to hinder rehearsals, such as Rosita floundering in her dance routine with the glory hog Gunther, Ash suffering from immense heartbreak when she thinks Lance cheated, Johnny inadvertently letting his dad be arrested during a heist in the shipping lanes, Meena's stage fright, and Mike owing money to a mob of bears when he cheats in a card game. Buster visits Eddie to convince him to get his grandmother Nana Noodleman (Jennifer Saunders) to host the reward money for the show. When they visit Nana, she accepts their offer, but in a snobbish manner. On the day Nana Noodleman comes, the bear mob who Mike earns the ire from come and demand the money from Buster, but his suitcase is full of junk, leading the others to turn on Buster for his deception. Before Buster can face anyone's wrath, a glass tank full of luminescent squids shatters and floods the theater, evicting everyone from it. After Nana leaves in a huff, the theater literally comes crashing down.Homeless and crestfallen, Buster takes up residence at Eddie's house. News of what transpired at the theater hits the airwaves and Buster is ridiculed, further diminishing his confidence. The contestants visit him and try to cheer him up, but Buster is too despondent to listen to them, so they leave. Buster tries to earn his keep by opening a car wash, using the same bucket that his dad used to pay for Buster's theater. Eddie, unwilling to see Buster so miserable, reminds him of what Buster had told him before: \"Once you hit rock bottom, there's nowhere else to go but up.\"After hearing Meena sing in the remains of the theater, Buster's confidence is renewed and he reinstates the show, leading everyone (including Rosita and Meena's families) to come. Mike bails out when he learns that the prize money is omitted, but soon returns to show his stuff."

While the characters are sometimes charming and voiced by an all-star cast (Matthew McConaughey, Seth MacFarlane, Reese Witherspoon, Scarlett Johansson), the writing is bland. There's little genuine humor, but there is a touch of heart. On the other hand, there are LOTS of songs, some with spirited arrangements and good performances. While it's ultimately uninspired, there's an energy that propels the action. Plus, with almost non-stop singing and lots of pop hits, it never gets boring."

A lot of laugh-out-loud lines, one classic sequence (the carwash) and, surprisingly, it veres from very funny to incredibly moving. Great for kids and adults.

      "text": "It\u2019s been said that the most powerful story is one that can be distilled to a single, simple, easy to understand idea. The more complex the idea the harder it is for emotional content to be connected to (or absorbed from) it. It certainly makes sense from a marketing perspective if not necessarily an artistic one; easily understood is easily sold.From that point of view, Sing makes perfect sense. Animate some current pop songs with anthropomorphic animals to add in some fun animation antics and sit back. It\u2019s a similar idea to the one behind stuff like Glee and Pitch Perfect but with more dancing pigs. It doesn\u2019t really make sense in any other way, but that\u2019s not particularly a deal breaker.The big driver is diminutive showman Buster Moon (McConaughey), the world\u2019s best worst theater producer. In love with musical theater since he was a child, Moon has been trying to make a go with his own theater for years but has come up with nothing but disappointment. On his last leg and with the bank threatening foreclosure, Moon has one last brainstorm \u2013 a singing competition that will both discover new talent and get the city invested in seeing one of their own make it to the big time.When a type-o in his competition flyer brings singers out of the woodwork, Buster is beset with more talent than he knows what to do with, including overworked housewife Rosita (Witherspoon), gangster-in-training Johnny (Egerton), brash lounge singer Mike (MacFarlane), wannabe punk rocker Ash (Johansson), and shy shower singer Meena (Kelly). But it will all be for naught if he can\u2019t get them to gel as an act or get anyone to come and watch, something he\u2019s never particularly excelled at.Simple ideas can have entertainment value and for all its lack of an animating idea (no pun intended), and when Sing does what it sets out to do, it\u2019s a solid time. It basically has two things to offer and not much else. The first is well-cast and directed voice work, primarily McConaughey. Buster is an irrepressible spirit, endlessly optimistic no matter what obstacles are thrust in his path.McConaughey imbues him with a can-do spirit and joy to be doing what he loves that his perseverance despite his failure is both funny and believable. He also eats up most of the screen time as his co-stars are constantly balanced against each other in order to keep their own stories understandable (if not developed) and reflect more light on Buster. And sing their songs really well, which they do. Egerton is a particular find and could easily have a career as a pop star if he decided to give up the whole acting thing.Beyond existing to have a place for the voice acting to emanate from the characters, Sing doesn\u2019t have a lot to offer. They are necessary evils for source music delivery and so that producers Illumination (Despicable Me) can practice the imaginative gag construction they\u2019ve become so good at. From Buddy\u2019s desperate attempts to fix his ailing theater to a very personal car wash, Sing\u2019s sight gags are where it\u2019s real innovation can be found."

It\u2019s not original. Children and teenagers could be fooled into liking it due to its  numerous pop songs, but there is insufficient story and there are not enough good laughs. As a results, adults would find it middling.>Cons: >1. For much of the film, it seemed like there was nothing special going on and that the film was merely propped up by the numerous recognisable pop songs. The last 20 minutes was much better, but even then there were only covers of pop songs apart from one new original song. Even so, that original song was not memorable.>2. One would think that the film would cover the long story behind each season of a reality TV singing competition show, but the potential number of \u2018contestants\u2019 were chopped down drastically at the first cut, to just seven acts! That seemed too few and too lacking in variety and talents. It was as if there was insufficient budget to get enough famous voice actors to voice for the animals! >Pros: Cons #2 ends up being a master stroke. There could have been too many acts if the format of American Idol was followed. More is not always better. More could end up stalling the film by having one pop song come after another. With fewer \u2018contestants\u2019, the end of the film felt sharper and sooner, which is good. >How would the different age groups rate it?Children: Excellent.Teens: Good.Young adults: AverageMedium age adults: AverageOld adults: Average.>My rating: 3/5 (no half scores).

Maybe because of that, I thought the trailers looked much better. I enjoyed the film, it had depth in characters than what I saw in the promotional videos. Though it is a simple story, and that worked so well.Its neither Disney or Pixer, but awesome. The good thing is the others as well getting there with par. It got nominated for the Golden Globe, but missed out the Oscars. A film for all ages. The musical is very common in animation, especially from Disney. This was a little different, a music genre. And the characters are the very special to this film to clinch the success.It could have been easily added to 'Zootopia' universe, since the two films are from different productions, that idea was ruled out. The selection of voice-over cast was excellent, particularly in the singing perspective. Recently Dwayne Johnson sang one for 'Moana'. I know the real life actors brought in for the marketing purpose, but anyway they all were so good.I liked a couple of tracks, but most of them are not original. Even the theme song from 'Zootopia' by Shakira had a small part in it. So this film is surely suggestible for anyone to try at any time in any mood. It only cheers, definitely worth spending time for it. Now bring it on a sequel. As per the latest news, they have announced which is going to hit the screen in 2020. That looks too long, I need it even before that. Meanwhile, you guys enjoy it if you'ven't watched it yet.8/10"

      "text": "Sing may be the most enjoyable film to come out of Illumination yet. Even more than the Despicable Me films. I know I gave criticism at The Wild Life for nothing happening whatsoever, but the reason for that is that it's executed in the most boring way out there. In Sing, nothing has been learned from Wild Life. The only difference is that the execution is much more fun. The story it tells is fun and witty, the animation is really good, and with the massive pile of characters, it's actually hard to pick a favorite. The only problem I have is that it constantly hops from one sub plot from another, which makes hard to focus on what's going on. It's even harder than choosing a favorite character. But despite the lack of focus on the story, it still passes as a fun movie."

      "text": "Well, I can certainly understand why the Golden Globes loved Illumination\u2019s thespian-infested movie.\u200bBased around something as universally understood as music, Sing seems to be an appropriate first-time directing effort by the duo Christopher Lourdelet and Garth Jennings (who directed live action before). The result of their hard work brings a passable accomplishment by the studio\u2019s sixth ever full-length feature, even if no studio gamechanger nonetheless.The feature takes place in an unnamed San Fran-Los Angeles-esque city painted by Miami, home to many anthropomorphic mammals, reptiles, birds, primates, household pets, cephalopods, arachnids, and whales. We focus on six mammals: one a producer, five the lucky choices for his theater-saving singing competition. Plenty celebrity voices deliver occasionally terrific singing, although the minor roles\u2019 unfitting voices draw back the overall quality. Surprisingly however, the anthropomorphic individuals\u2019 subplots are all masterfully balanced in their yearnings on the road to fame and fortune:Buster Moon the koala (Matthew McConaughey) wants to keep the theater financially stable after his father passed down the torch. Despite being the lead, he is the least interesting cast member, more existing to vocalize the clich\u00e9 morals. Though he still plays great off the more colorful characters, including his dimwitted senior secretary, Miss Crawly the iguana.Rosita the pig (Reese Witherspoon) wants to follow her passion away from her uncaring husband and twenty-five children. She soon meets unexpected challenges when the competition pairs her with an overly optimistic pig named Gunter. This widely marketed chunk of ham shockingly gets little stage time; and I should also mention how he flaunts an indistinguishable European accent exaggerated to the point of annoyance. The immature will worship him like Moccus, leaving adults to gag a bit while watching an overweight swine in a unitard stereotyping western culture.Johnny the gorilla (Taron Egerton) wants to escape his father\u2019s criminal lifestyle, and follow his heart for the microphone. Boys across all ages will relate to this highly soulful musician, despite a phoned in resolution to his subplot.Ash the porcupine (Scarlett Johansson) seeks public appreciation alongside her boyfriend/musical partner. While her story feels relatively unengaging compared to the others, she still brings a nice voice, especially when her guitar strums electrify her quills to the point of showering out.Mike the mouse (Seth MacFarlane) needs the prize money to pay back a bear gang who see him as a tasty meal. His ratty account maybe could have benefited from higher stakes against the law; but it does not matter anyway, for this crude comedian providing the voice amazingly makes a tiny crooner so ruggedly lovable with some spice thrown in.Meena the elephant (Tori Kelly) cannot pursue her love for singing, as her glossophobia gets in the way, with no thanks to her arrogant grandfather. She has the most poorly balanced yet easily relatable experience for all the boys and girls facing a similar fear.Together, doubt gets conquered in a unified walk to fame and fortune. So who ends up winning the competition?It doesn\u2019t matter! They are all too introspective to notice one another, as these well-rounded individual stories have zero interweaving amongst one another. In the end, Sing cares less about teamwork, and more about getting children to worship the most popular hits by Lady GaGa, Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, Carly Rae Jepsen, and everyone else out there (just stay through the credits, the list of songs used lasts over a minute). It doesn\u2019t matter if the human artist singles are sung by cute little animals; accompanied by predictable fart jokes, evidence proves why this movie aims squarely toward kids with an affinity of music over rules, offering the parents nothing more than a few scattered chuckles to at least manage without booing the artist offstage."

      "text": "Sing is another charming production by the new animation big shots in town, Illumination. It's story, following a koala bear trying to save his failing theater with a singing competition, is a wonderful film to keep everyone enjoyed. The characters are very interesting, especially Johnny the Gorilla, and the music numbers make the film even more fun. Surprisingly though, the film didn't quite live up to the mark in terms of story arc for its numerous characters or even in the humor department. Yes there were a number of funny parts, but after productions like Despicable Me and Minions, I had expected a little more amusment. However, the story is solid and this film is sure to excite every member of the whole family."

They warm my soul, make me feel like a child again, and usually always tug at my heartstrings. This movie combined humor, music, and love. Not a love story kind of love, but a deeper kind of love. It was smart, and it was smacked with stars\u2013literally and figuratively.Everyone loves an underdog. If you say you don\u2019t, you\u2019re lying. Matthew McConaughey voices Buster Moon, a passionate koala theater owner struggling to make ends meet. He hasn\u2019t had a successful show in years, he can\u2019t pay his employees, and the bank won\u2019t stop calling. In a moment of desperation, he decides to plan one last show, one that he thinks will save his theater and the Moon family name. A singing competition. He rounds up the last of his money as a cash reward and has his assistant, Ms. Crawl, to print out flyers for the event on the last bit of paper they have in the office. Ms. Crawl is a lizard with one eye, who seems to always be losing her fake glass eye, and while typing up the flyers for the event, she makes a grave mistake. What was supposed to read as a $1000 prize accidentally gets printed as a $100,000 prize.In the meantime, we have also met the rest of the main cast. They are collectively a group of talented singers, struggling living a normal everyday life all with the same passion: singing. We meet Rosita, voiced by Reese Witherspoon, a stay at home mother of 25 piglets. She longs for a life outside of staying at home all day, and her husband barely seems to notice her anymore. Ash, Scarlett Johansson, is a porcupine in a two person band with her egocentric boyfriend who tells her constantly that she isn\u2019t good enough to be heard. Meena, a shy elephant with a voice that will knock your socks off, being voiced by Tori Kelly what more could you expect? Mike is a little mouse with a big ego. He sings on the streets and has dreams to live a lavish lifestyle, Seth MacFarlane couldn\u2019t have been a better choice for this character. And finally, quite possibly my favorite character of the movie, a gorilla named Johnny, voiced by Taron Egerton. Johnny\u2019s family is involved in a shady gang, and Johnny wants out. He\u2019s too sweet for the lifestyle and just wants to do what he loves most\u2013sing. But he won\u2019t do anything to disappoint his father.They all enter the singing competition. There is a lot of different talent in the competition, as you see on actual singing competitions on television. Buster picks his favorites and the competition begins. Of course, then he learns of the mistake on the flyer, and now has to come up with $99,000 for the prize money. Now, without giving away any major spoilers for the movie, that is all I can really report on, but it is worth the money to take your kids! They\u2019ll love it and so will you.This movie is truly enjoyable for people of all ages. It has enough depth that parents or older siblings, or just adults like me who love children\u2019s movies as well, can watch and not be bored. The kids will love the different animal characters, and they\u2019ll love the humor. It\u2019s cute and fun, and it will make you laugh. There will be moments you feel sad. It teaches valuable life lessons for people of all ages. And the ending is perfect. No story line is left with a loose end."

Ultimately, \"Sing\" wasn't a huge leap forward from \"The Secret Life of Pets\" thanks to its slightly all-over-the-place story, the somewhat unlikeable protagonist, and the fact that Illumination's trademark humor isn't really on display here. However, I'd be lying if I didn't say that \"Sing\" had some beautiful animation, great music, solid vocal performances, heartwarming moments, and other charming characters that helped keep it afloat. Sure, it's a flawed film, and it won't rank as one of Illumination's best, but \"Sing\" is still an enjoyable entry in the company's filmography, and it's definitely worth giving a shot."

Well, that's a great recipe... to build empty movies.Sing delivers an important element of storytelling almost every contemporary movie is forgetting: The story and character building.For those who watch more than 10-15 seconds of the animation knows this: The story is about a dream. About a individual who never gives up on its dreams, and get to change the life of the ones who are alongside with it. The song they sing at the end of the movie has something to do with every character.\"American Idol\"? Did the reviewers REALLY watch the movie to the end? The \"singing competition\" NEVER happens at the movie! People are really missing the point about this movie!The animation is really enjoyable to watch.Voice casting is just right.The character construction is fairy tale level.Verdict: 10/10. Don't watch it if you expect a glittering superficial movie with no real meaning to be."
