Could it be the Franco-American Spaghetti phenomenon? Perhaps... I'll admit that could be part of it.Huh, you don't know about that? Well, when I was a kid liked FAS. If I had FAS as an adult, I'd no doubt hate it, but... well... it's too late... I love it, story over--I LUV LUV LUV'd it, as a child, and still do.Anyway, perhaps the magic this movie has is bound to time and age, but whatever, it will ALWAYS hold a  warm place inside me. How many fliks do that?Whatever, I HEREBY DECLARE THIS FLIK COMEDY GOLD -- A NATIONAL TREASURE!!!It is to me, no other will be declared as such--my review, my hyperbole."

      "text": "Weatherman Phil Connors is sent to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania to begrudgingly cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities. Following the broadcast he tries to leave town but finds himself caught in a snowstorm which forces him to spend the night. Unfortunately for Phil he awakes the next day to find that it is actually Groundhog Day again and again and again. At first confused by his predicament Phil soon realises that he can also use it to his advantage; to re-write the events of his day, and to generally have a whale of a time.\r The repeating day formula has now been done to death in movies and on TV but none have ever lived up to the quality of Groundhog Day. This is largely due to Bill Murray, always a brilliant comic actor, but is truly exceptional here. The movie does contain some darker moments as Phil finds himself losing hope but Groundhog Day is primarily a comedy, and an excellent one at that, and the fact that the term Groundhog Day has entered popular culture is the best testament to this.\r Often imitated but never bettered Groundhog Day is a must see movie."

Romance doesn't bother this cool old classic, it's all part of the beauty and the sparkling light at the end of this tunnel."

Everything about Groundhog Day is different than all comedies already existing. It's such an awesome and unique thing seeing somebody wake up, thinking it's a new day, but realizing it's the same day they already lived the day before.\r After a while, Connors tries to do everything he wanted to do before. You also feel sympathy for him, because there are scenes in which he talks to this girl that he has a crush on and they meet for a night, tell stories, etc. He wakes up the next morning, asking her if she remembers what they did yesterday, and she has no clue what he is talking about, because it's the same day.\r Groundhog Day is a bit of a confusing movie, but if you're up for watching it, definitely don't miss this film!"

      "text": "Groundhog Day is a movie with a simple message but the way in which it is developed is amazing, because it is purely human, the things Phil does are the ones that probably everyone would do if they were in that situation. At first he tries to resolve the problem, and then he takes advantage of the circumstances, after that the meteorologist attempts to finish with his condition, and finally Phil reaches the maximum level of egocentricity believing that he is some kind of God, until he realizes that there is only one way to scape. What the whole thing represents is the path you need to go through in order to lose and find yourself, although the things that happen in the middle are of your business.This film has a great cast, starting by Bill Murray, which I think is the best performance of his career; also Andie MacDowell and Stephen Tobolowsky are incredible. The music is so nostalgic, my favorite is I Got You Babe by Sonny and Cher, and the form in which is interrupted by the broadcasters always makes me laugh. This is a special picture and I will never forget it, and if you think the Groundhog day is repeated to many times, I can say to you: that day is repeated the same amount of times as the days in a season."

      "text": "The difference and long-lasting legacy that clings to Bill Murray's 'Groundhog Day' is that it is a genuinely funny film, Murray takes the reigns on a sort of time-travel/loop piece that is simple in premise, but complex and meaningful in delivery, witty yet slapstick at the same time.  It takes a natural approach to the subject of how someone would react to living the same day over and over again, the first step is shock and disbelief, but onwards its fun and reaping the rewards of an unexplainable phenomenon, that's exactly what weatherman Phil (Murray) experiences as he covers Groundhog Day in Pennsylvania, he is a confident, egotistical and charming man who meets producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) who sees right through Phil and his over-zealous personality. As he begins to relive the same day, he starts to use it to his advantage to try and woo Rita, this is where we begin to see Phil seeing the error of his ways and his attempts to try and change his life. Murray brings real charisma and vintage charm to a simple role, his timing and reaction is in full force here where he uses his repetition of days for selfish means and also to impress flabbergasted onlookers for his 'predictions' of Jeopardy. This is an interesting tale of how repetition and routine can change ones outlook in their own life, whether they feel meaningless or not, it also shows the impact that he can have on others, but it also studies the fact that everyone has the room for change and never to settle for the same old thing, even though he sees it day after day. While the film can be too deliberately paced for some, it explores each avenue of such a life-changing event even if it happens again and again, realising the people closest to him matter most, whether co-workers or even homeless strangers, he tries to change everyone's life even in the smallest of ways.\rThis is a funny, touching and equally as inspirational piece of cinema that takes risks in the repetitive nature but ultimately pays off to see the change in one person, Bill Murray couldn't have been more likeable or sincere in his delivery as he struggles with not knowing how to get out of the rut he is in, and how to convince other people to see the change in him."

      "text": "Groundhog Day is absolutely hilarious, but also manages to be a very heart warming and smart. Throughout, the repeating days never becomes old and tired, much the opposite in fact as every time he relived the same day it felt new and interesting. Plus, every scene never really ceased to be funny, as Bill Murray was undeniably at his very best in this film, both as a comedian and as an actor. In addition, the moral and events of this one are almost always very touching when they are not funny. Watching Phil Collins transform as a human being by living the same day is a great thing to watch and is also a credit to the great script for this one. The script manages to tell a story that has been told many times before in a very fresh and unique way, while almost tricking us into thinking it is brand new. That is not bad thing either, as it really makes this film all the more enjoyable and always leaves you wondering what is ahead next. Overall, this one is a very unique approach to a similar topic that never really feels tired thanks to its great acting, comedic elements, and script."

      "text": "Groundhog Day sets out to accomplish the inconceivable, where few comedies, or movies of any kind, or art forms of any device dare to tread. It is determined to ultimately answer: How does one find true happiness. The kind of baby that might have been hatched by crossing Woody Allen and Dali Lama. What's truly amazing is that it pretty well achieves this without being pretentious or portentous. Its humble, pedestrian style coincides with it's charitable message. Furthermore, it's a riot!\r What do you do when the snowstorm of life traps you into a place you don't want to be? Self-destructive anarchy is an option: drinking, stealing, screwing, lying, joyriding and suicide. But this is a big storm so long-term solutions are required. The good news if you're lonely and unhappy? You probably have more time to dedicate to self- improvement (music lessons, ice sculpturing).\r But challenging the self must have worthwhile outcomes. Phil, believing he's magical, challenges himself to get Rita to sleep with him within 24 hours. He's being dishonest, still playing games and ends up getting slapped in the face repeatedly. It appears that Phil's obstinate pattern of narcissistic behaviour is the cause of this inert existential loop, and one that traps everyone he is in contact with. When he finally realizes that while money, sex and immediate self-gratification might have their perks, they are short-lived and vastly overrated, and a major personality overhaul will be required to escape this Kafkaesque nightmare. An endless, insanely frigid winter is bound to contain him (them (us)) unless new strategies are introduced, alternative energies adopted, the shift away from a self-serving paradigm sustained.\r To his credit, Phil refuses to be cornered in by the status quo and become one in a million zombies chanting \u201cit is what it is\u201d.  Phil actually starts to recover when he gives up trying. When he dismisses the quick fixes (sex, booze, anger, lying and fighting), when he relinquishes his ego and lets go of his smarmy King Joffrey-Justin Bieber juvenility, when he learns to be himself, like himself, settle into his own skin so he can thrive in and, in turn, improve his surroundings. In a reversal of \"It's a Wonderful Life\", rather than Bedford Falls being worse off from George's absence, Punxsutawney is better off with Phil's presence. Routine days require routine acts of kindness and Phil and the entire town collectively benefit from it. Phil is a born-again humanist, one who rescues himself from himself, escaping a solipsistic rotation of mutually-destructive behaviour simply by being a good Samaritan. The forecast: many rewarding days of sunshine.\r I always had a bit of a problem with the ending. That the cycle of unhappiness only ends when the guy gets the girl. But now I see that getting the girl was coincidental (and symbolic). Before he gets the girl he has to get himself. That's how you put a reverse spin on a downward spiral. The girl is now able to love the boy because he is love-worthy. The boy could be anyone. A politician. A corporation. You."

While it is not reasonable to think what happens to Phil is truly possible, once you accept the basic concept of the plot, it is almost impossible to find any real holes in the remainder. Suspension of disbelief is not a problem.Performances are very good from the entire cast. There isn't a single player that doesn't add to the film. In fact, some of the bit parts are the kind of acting that you will remember the rest of your life.Also, I think that the material covered makes the most of the viewing time. The script is tight and poignant, all while being very funny for those that like this kind of humor. It's a must see for everyone. Even those that don't like the humor should be stimulated by the paradox of the film's plot. I find myself uplifted and inspired every time. For the Phil in every one of us, we are reminded that opening our eyes to the humanity around us is humbling, and that true love begins with sacrifice and modesty.If you haven't seen Groundhog Day, you are doing yourself a disservice."

The combination of the enjoyable idea, a charming cast with a great Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell and director Harold Ramis works excellent. It is a fantasy comedy that has elements of self discovery, a love story and a lot of philosophic elements that give a lot of depth. Also you can just see it as family film and it works also well. It is one of the movies you will rewatch once in a while with fond memories. The story is around the television weatherman Phil Connors. He, his cameraman Larry and producer Rita Hanson will travel to the small city Punxsutawney to cover the annual Groundhog Day festival for their TV station. This is actual torture for Phil who even does not hide his disgust for everything involved like the whole festival, town, coverage and citizens. This will get worse as he will end in a situation that will trap him in the town. I try to avoid spoilers here for those that do not know the excellent twist. The story works really well. The message and character development is a true strength. The movie is immersive, relatable and enjoyable. It has humor and seriousness where nothing harms the other. The conclusion is truly amazing and rounds up a great experience. Just as side note: The town of Punxsutawney and the Groundhog Day festival really exists but it was not filmed there. Just google it if you don't believe me here. Back to the review. I will praise Harold Ramis first as he is such a great director (also actor and writer). He deserved far more praise for his works as many of his movies are classics I and others don't want to miss. Now to the actors. Of cause this is an awesome performance from Bill Murray as Phil Connors. I say this movie was made for him as he could deliver the full range of his talents. He gives everything you want from a Bill Murray performance. I know the statement \u201cThe yin to the yang\u201d is cliche but with Andie MacDowell as Rita Hanson it fits perfect. She is the other half to Bill Murray\u2019s performance and truly excellent. These two together enhance the movie. The actors who play the townsfolk of Punxsutawney are all amazing and deliver such a good and natural performance. The overall performance is so good you often forget it is a movie. I have to praise the whole cast for their great performance. The movie town of Punxsutawney is actually Woodstock in Illinois who is famous for this. It is a beautiful smaller city that gave a remarkable location for the movie with a lot of charm. I have also to praise the music. Of cause Sonny and Chers \u201cI got you Babe\u201d is an integral part of the movie. There are some classical music and more modern hits (for its time). Some are well integrated into the movies story. Overall I see this as timeless classic and must see movie. The story is so relatable and heartwarming. The conclusion rounds up the character developments as much as the movie. I can say movies like this are not made anymore and it would be true."

The script is a delight, always funny, quotable and witty, while the story has a surprisingly refreshing concept and several great scenes.The cinematography is beautiful, and the locations and production values are consistently striking. Also Harold Ramis's direction is excellent, the pace rarely lags and all the characters are credible. The acting is wonderful too, and by far one of the best assets of this film. Bill Murray gives one of the best performances of his career, Stephen Tabolowsky gives a superb turn as the nerdy insurance salesman and the lovely Andie McDowell has never been better.In conclusion, a delightful film that works on all levels. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

      "text": "The artistic medium of film is very subjective. Every audience member has a different set of criteria they use to measure their viewing experience. Not everyone shares the same set of criteria. If we did, what a bland and uninspired world this would be.\r What I Personally Liked About \"Groundhog Day\":\rFirst and foremost: Bill Murray. Seriously, how can you not like this man's performance? It takes a very skilled actor to craft an arrogant, sarcastic, unlovable **** of a character and actually turn him into someone the viewer cares about by the end of the film. The man is a genius with his delivery of lines, his facial expressions are dead on in every scene, and the suffering he feels over his burgeoning humanity can be shared by each and every member of the audience. Andie MacDowell creates a wonderful counterpoint to Murray as well. The semi-awkward chemistry they share feels natural and unrehearsed, both when it's obvious she is supposed to be disgusted by Murray's egocentrism and when she is supposed to be falling for his cute attempts at chivalry. I also feel that one of the most genuinely romantic segments of any film released from the nineties can be found in this movie: Murray and MacDowell dancing in the gazebo to the Ray Charles version of \"You Don't Know Me.\" I often wonder how many guys in real life tried to recreate that scene on one of their own dates. I'm betting there were at least a few who did.\r What I Personally Disliked About \"Groundhog Day\":\rMy worst complaint for this film is the schizophrenic nature of the comedy. The subtle bits work well; particularly the many deaths of Phil Connors montage (and the subsequent discussion about Phil's status as a deity) and the gluttonous indulgence Phil displays with the sweets and coffee. However, the blatant attempts to lighten the mood with material such as driving on the railroad tracks or the stealing of the groundhog just seem too over-the-top when trying to fit into the general mood of the film. They stick out like sore thumbs which have been hit by twenty pound hammers, to be frank. But that is a minor quibble which can be overlooked by the magnificence of the remainder of the movie.\r My Overall Impression of \"Groundhog Day\":\rExploring the concept of being allowed to (or rather forced to) live one day of your life over and over again until you get it right (or rather as reasonable a facsimile of \"right\" as you can get) is an enthralling notion for me. It was also extraordinarily different from anything else which was being done in romantic comedies at the time. Oh sure, you had the wacky weatherman story of Harris K. Telemacher two years earlier, however that film just didn't have the same warmth or the same staying power that \"Groundhog Day\" showcased to perfection. This is an incredible film that I have watched more times than I care to admit and will probably continue to watch more times than I am currently able to imagine."

En fait, plus on la regarde, plus ses d\u00e9fauts vous sautent aux yeux : sa morale \u00e0 l'eau de rose, son romantisme de supermarch\u00e9 et sa na\u00efvet\u00e9 bon teint finissent irr\u00e9m\u00e9diablement par gaver.Pour autant, c'est un r\u00f4le sur mesure pour le fac\u00e9tieux Bill, lequel reste tout de m\u00eame dans les clous d'un sc\u00e9nario tr\u00e8s balis\u00e9 -on sait que le trublion se laisse facilement emporter dans les affres de la d\u00e9bilit\u00e9- pour le meilleur et pour le pire. Aussi rit-on de temps en temps sur ce th\u00e8me et variations au fil des essais et erreurs de ce sacr\u00e9 Phil... c'est-\u00e0-dire Bill perdu \u00e0 Peczouille-land.Pareil pour Andie l'andouillette au sujet de laquelle on arrive n\u00e9anmoins pas \u00e0 se d\u00e9cider (dans ce film pr\u00e9cis en tout cas) : est-elle d\u00e9licieusement charmante ou insupportablement pouffe \u00e9colo-bourgeoise ? elle et sa po\u00e9sie italienne du 19\u00e8me si\u00e8cle. Putain.A partir d'une id\u00e9e entousiasmante, Un jour sans fin est devenu assez convenu malgr\u00e9 ou \u00e0 cause de Bill mais surtout \u00e0 cause de son \u00e9criture tr\u00e8s Disney-t\u00eate \u00e0 claques.

      "text": "there wasn't one today..Groundhog DayEven though the premise had the potential and sometimes it does wander off on dark tracks the maker picks the smart approach on narrowing down the complexity to light and breezy tone that is mildly soothing and satisfying. Harold Ramis could have done some better work in it along with editing the screenplay a bit tighter too; around 90 minutes would have been adequate. Bill Murray is excellent as the protagonist in this fantasy and he pulls it off all alone in his shoulder with head held high and doing some of his career's finest work. Groundhog Day is a beautiful feature that explores the innocence and priorities of human nature by projecting some dark and practical work on screen that is supported by stellar performances."
