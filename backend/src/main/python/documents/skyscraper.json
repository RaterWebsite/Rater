      "text": "\"San Andreas\" was Dwayne Johnson's most fun as an action hero. Then, came \"Rampage,\" which was not. This time, they've heaped the absurd situations and ridiculous odds high enuff to reach the top of the titular structure. His character is hired as a security consultant on this incredible new building (the highest in the world). When it's sabotaged, he has to save the day and his family. Single-handedly, he overcomes outrageous obstacles and a fleet of armed baddies, but none of it is especially thrilling or even over the top in a fun way. It's big, splashy and predictable...and it's time for Johnson to find a new genre (or director)."

      "text": "Whatever you do, don\u2019t look down! Hope that you aren\u2019t scared of heights, because if you are, Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson\u2019s newest film might be a little hard for you to swallow and watch.The hardest working actor in Hollywood is back, and this time, teaming up with the man behind the hit cult comedy Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story and We\u2019re The Millers. But instead for opting for a straight up comedy, the two team up to deliver a Die Hard inspired and overly-stylized The Towering Inferno film that is meant to be the ultimate summer movie. Skyscraper is blockbuster, Hollywood entertainment like we have never seen before. Taking cues from the best and worst summer blockbusters before it, Skyscraper is a non-stop, high octane, adrenaline filled popcorn flick for everyone.Like any movie Dwayne Johnson does in his career at this point, he adds his undeniable charm and heart into each and every project, and the same could be felt with his newest. What makes Johnson\u2019s Will Swayer so likeable, aside from the fact that he is the ultimate family man, who will back down to no challenge involving his family, is the fact that he is modelled like any family man before him. Relinquishing his duties form the military following a rescue mission gone wrong, Will is faced to live the rest of his life with only one leg. Luckily for him, with every painful path in life, comes beauty. Sparking a romance with the doctor who saved his life, Will finds his life ten years later in Hong Kong, as a security assessment official, who must now give his expertise and knowledge to the largest free-standing building in the world, The Pearl. With a little help from an old friend Ben (Pablo Schreiber), Will pitches his small-business motto to Zhao Long Ji (Chin Han), the architect behind The Pearl, only to land the biggest deal of his life. Excited to share the news with his family, Will celebrates his big accomplishment with his best firmed Ben, only to find that The Pearl has been taken hostage and set ablaze, with his family still in it.From the first day of production, Skyscraper was always hailed as a homage to so many high-rise tension filled films before it. While no one ever believes anyone will be able to replace John McClane, Johnson is easily a very comparable action star with massive commercial appeal. Oozing with charisma and charm, Johnson\u2019s character will not only becomes likeable for his personal quality traits and his unpardonable love for his family, but I\u2019m sure that one of the biggest selling points of this film, was the fact that Johnson\u2019s character is in fact, disabled. It is almost unheard of that action stars are in fact, disabled ex-military personnel who are still capable of kicking butt and beating bad guys. Not only does Johnson play Sawyer with class and bravado, but the film also highlights many times where his prosthetic legs becomes a tool for rescuing his family, as opposed to a weakness. This narrative driving force, and this one alone, is one of my favourite and most enjoyable, as well as respectable character traits, in recent memory in the summer blockbuster genre.It is no surprise that Hollywood loves Johnson right now, inflicting him into, practically, every franchise available at the moment. With that said, it has come to a surprise to me that Johnson has not been inducted into the MCU yet, but I am sure time will tell.While many would be surprised to seer Neve Campbell cast as Sarah Sawyer, Johnson\u2019s wife in the film, it only goes to show how powerful Johnson\u2019s presence is on screen, even when actors who have been absent from the silver screen are able to come back to revive their careers for smaller roles like this one. While the only name that matters on the movie posters may be Johnson\u2019s, one of the best actors cast in the film is a person favourite of mine, Roland M\u00f8ller, the certified baddie in Skyscraper. While M\u00f8ller\u2019s Kores Botha doesn\u2019t have much intent, fibre or much to do or say within the film, but it is always great seeing foreign actors breaking through into Hollywood films. M\u00f8ller was astonishing in one of my favourite foreign films in the last couple years in Land of Mine. Skyscraper surely will have many palms sweating, many hearts racing and people forcing themselves to cover their eyes thanks to some very crazy and absurd stunt work and visual effects of Will Sawyer jumping, dangling and racing in and around the fictional largest building in the world. Skyscraper is the typical escapist summer blockbuster film of the year, and one that, for maybe two hours out of your summer, will be a satisfying retreat into the air-conditioned theatre away from the heat that is outside, even if more than half the action in the film is borderline ridiculous.Skyscraper is just another entry into the very expansive filmography of Dwayne Johnson, further reinforcing just how wonderfully suave and likeable he really is."

Just looking at the advertisements you can already tell it\u2019s gonna be those type of movies where you have to accept it to enjoy it. If you watched the trailer where Dwayne jumps off a crane into another building to rescue his family who are trapped inside, before cutting to the release date. It\u2019s absurd, although looks fun. Might follow the same path of \u2018Fast & the Furious\u2019 type of ridiculous, yet fun. However, what really took me by surprise is how the movie doesn't quite embrace it\u2019s stupidity, and instead goes for a more serious tone. So during those ridiculous moments, when I meant to switch off my brain and enjoy, but I couldn't buy into it. Basically it\u2019s \u2018Dike Hard\u2019 and \u2018Tower Inferno\u2019, drowned out in CGI.I know those comparisons have already been made by many people and the marketing campaign seemed to catch on by releasing spoof-like posters of those two films. What some have failed to bring up it\u2019s not just those two movies it\u2019s ripping off, as there\u2019s plenty more. Literally every action movie ever, just done better before.Die Hard? more like \u2018Try Hard\u2019.Dwayne Johnson can make anything watchable. The dude is instantly likable in everything he\u2019s in; both on screen and off. In this movie it\u2019s no different. Although It\u2019s not one of his best and we have seen better from him. Dwayne character is basic family man saving his wife and kids. The charisma was lacking and you expect more from The Rock in terms of picking roles. There\u2019s no witty banter between other characters to flesh him out or anything. Overexposed maybe?Neve Campbell delivered a decent performance and it\u2019s great seeing her back. Unfortunately, just like Dwayne Johnson, she has no character besides being a plot device along with the children.So let's talk about the villains, and yes I say \u201cvillainS\u201d because there\u2019s are so many the film keeps shifting focus. The bad guys are generic and not threatening at all. It\u2019s even more funny when you realize there was no thought about their plan for it to work- allowing only on luck and convenience. They morons.The biggest strength I thought the film succeed on was playing on your fear with heights. My hands started to sweat and your heart begins to beat faster. You\u2019re afraid to look down. I thought those scenes was well done, especially the close calls moments.Also the opening scene was pretty good. The way it opened was tragic and really sad, but that doesn't last very long.Overall rating: Better get more duct tape."

It is short on technical aspects like visual effects, (which is a downer considering that it depends a lot upon it) sound department and better editing. It is shot decently with some pleasing scenes here and there, that are implemented to attract the viewers which too wears off sooner than expected. The writing is cheesy, corny and amateur with forced humor installed to balance the commercial aspect of it which isn't palpable to Johnson's character whose effort to breed the sincerity and seriousness communicates unevenly. The characters are loud, unnecessarily expressive and aren't polished appropriately, leaving them a bit chalky around the edges to swallow. The action sequences are shot brilliantly with Johnson in command who hits hard and brutal with convincing hand-to-hand combat where his hard work is clearly visible on the screen. He is good on physical sequences although struggling; even though improving, on acting skills and also isn't supported to that extent by the supporting cast like Neve Campbell and Chin Han.Rawson Marshall Thurber; the writer-director, seems to have taken the opportunity granted for neither his sloppy writing nor shallow execution convinces the audience to be invested in it. The Johnson's hard work and few choreographed action sequences are the only high points of the feature.Skyscraper lacks a layered surface to scratch on, for the revealing hollowness in a material is neither impressive nor advantageous."

There's good tension in the action sequences and Dwayne is pretty convincing in his role and in portraying the terror and desperation of fighting to rescue your family from a burning uber-skyscraper.  But, the  plot and all that follows is not novel.  Most disappointing was that we never really got to know the intricacies of the villains.  We had their story and identity but that was all.  Their characters were flat and had no personality.  It's a film you enjoy and then forget."

We soon learn that the person who got him the job set him up, and then he gets lured away from the building and roped into what is essentially a heist story. The building is set on fire, and his family and the bad guys are in the building, so he jumps off of a crane to get back into the building to beat up some bad guys and save his family. That's basically it. This is a 90s-era action flick released in 2018. Clearly the team behind this film knows that, too, as one of the posters they put out while marketing the film had a 90s theme to it. Unfortunately, this isn't the 90s anymore and really this isn't even a good 90s action flick. The action is mediocre and honestly this isn't the best character Dwayne Johnson has played in his recent onslaught of the box office. He's charming, but humor is one of his strengths and there isn't a lot of it in this film. It's mainly him doing unbelievable thing after unbelievable thing until he achieves his goal of getting to his family. The story also takes a few leaps towards the end that I just couldn't get behind, most notably something related to how the fire containment system works at the beginning of the movie compared to the end. There's also some odd pacing in this story that we're supposed to just ignore because it's an action movie, but some of it is just so unbelievable I couldn't help but laugh. Don't expect any great dialogue here, either, as the script is mediocre at best. But, is it entertaining? That is usually the saving grace of these kind of movies. And, well...yes, it's entertaining. This is a film that will allow some people to turn their brain off for nearly two hours, eat some popcorn, and enjoy the show. It's incredibly forgetful, though, and I don't think I'll ever watch this one again."

I really liked a closed-knit fight near the beginning where both characters do a lot of damage to each other. The Rock's character having a prosthetic leg was a fairly novel idea that was well utilized for the survival and action elements.Also the film looks nice.

The performances as a whole are very strong, Neve Campbell is fantastic as a strong and capable wife. The problem with this movie as a whole, while it obviously \"pays homage to Die Hard, Towering Inferno, ect\" theres a difference between paying homage and ripping off. With that being said, it's a solid film but could have benefited more from being it's own film."

      "text": "The movie was ok, but the story is used so many times, in many different settings, that it basically did not bring anything that really interesting here. And I think this is a typical ''popcorn'' movie that is only good when watching in cinema, to fully see the special effects etc. Without that, it is quite average."

And the villain girl wearing big earings? What is the deal with that? Surely they cannot help her in fight scenes or can they?Rock is great as ever but the whole idea of the movie is as weak spot."

      "text": "Skyscraper is a very Hollywood movie. \"The Rock\" is a former FBI agent who helps his family in a fire. He fights with terrorists. I was impressed by Johnson's actions. He never made me sleep. Many critics say \"This is a recycled movie of \" Die Hard\". But computer graphics are beautiful. \"Skyscraper\" is much better than \"Die Hard\". This is a very international movie. It made me feel like living in Hong Kong. This is a 'popcorn movie\". You just enjoy \" The Rock\"! I want to watch it one more time."

The movie was a little too unrealistic, and a lot too predictable (throughout most of the movie). Even with those things though, the movie was still very fun and entertaining to watch, which is something I was wanting from the movie. I recommend it, even though it is predictable."
