Picking up a year after the events of its superior sequel. Jamie now lives in a foster home and is mute. Once again played by a solid Danielle Harris. After falling down the well in the last film he's saved by a homeless dude and awakens a year later to try and get Jamie once again. This entry is a little uneven tone wise. There are weird lapses in humor most because of two goofy cops. Michael is still in pretty strong form but his victims are mostly forgettable. Sadly Ellie Cornell is only in a small part and the new final girl Tina isn't as strong. It all leads up to a questionable finale and although nothing is on par with the rooftop sequence from the last film. The laundry schute scene is pretty terrifying."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "Where do i begin with this piece of trash movie? It's so boring , characters are awful aside from Loomis.

You almost ruined a film with seemingly good potential. Why? You really wanted to give us this annoyance? ..Good : There are barely any good things I remember in this film. The story direction they decided to go after they kind of undid the final moments of the previous film was okay. What they tried to do with Dr. Loomis was fine. But all these good things were executed improperly. ..Bad : By bad, I mostly mean frustrating. I liked the character arc they tried to give to Dr. Loomis. But they crossed a line. He was obsessed with bringing down Myers - fine. He is more obsessed in this film - that's okay. But he wasn't an **** in the previous films. If it wasn't for the previous films, I would clearly understand the characterization given to him in this film was that of a selfish **** He is simply annoying, even though I know what he was trying to do. The obsession factor overshadowed the likeability of the character. And, there has been no character development for him to act that way. The main character from the previous film gets killed off and instead we get a very annoying character as our final girl. I am not against the final character of the previous film getting killed. I am against the way they do it. It feels too disrespectful to a character I loved in the previous film. Some choices of music is quite annoying as well. You get that goofball music when the stupid ass **** dumb cops arrive, as if we didn't know that they were stupid ass **** dumb cops. They (spoilers for part 4) undo the thing with Jamie taking on the mantle of Myers from the ending of the previous film for just some psychic **** which feels like dishonest treatment of the thrill the previous had. It just doesn't feel right. Alright. I can digest all of it. But the main thing that bugs me and a lot of other fans is that it was just a mess to set up another mess titled \"The Curse of Michael Myers\". The entire set up for \"cult of thorn\" **** is the only thing that makes a slight amount of sense, that too because, it was explained in the next film. But again, all the good it does is to make us feel that the cult **** isn't forced. ..Conclusion : I really wanted to like this movie. I really did. But it makes so odd choices for some characters and continuity that all the choices simply overshadow the actual intent of the director. It doesn't feel right. ..Rating. ..Score : 5.5/10Grade : C"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Defining a new element to the franchise they tried, and the end it didn't turn out great. But i still enjoyed it anyway."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "John Carpenter's 1978 'Halloween' is wholly deserving of its status as a horror classic. To this day it's still one of the freakiest films personally seen and introduced the world to one of horror's most iconic villainous characters Michael Myers.Which is why it is such a shame that not only are all of the sequels nowhere near as good but that the decline in quality is so drastic. Ok, the original 'Halloween' is very difficult to follow on from, but most of the sequels could at least looked like effort was made into them. To me, and many others it seems, 'Halloween 5' is one of the worst of the series. Even with its attempt at a grittier tone, it is far from a thrill ride and there is very little scary about it, other than one scene and how poor quality the film is.Danielle Harris and Don Shanks give strong performances, as does Ellie Cornell in the limited screen time she has. Donald Pleasance does his best and succeeds in creating an unnerving presence, but his character is now too much of a caricature which is at the writers' door not his.There is one effective scene, that with the laundry chute which is actually pretty freaky. The setting has a haunting eeriness when it is not hindered by the low-budget-looking rushed-looking filming.Sadly, most of the time it is with the editing being especially amateurish. The direction is also sloppy, especially in the dramatically inept non-horror scenes. The music is here a drawback when it was one of the better elements of the three previous sequels. Here it sounds cheap, goofy and would have sounded out of date even in the 80s most likely.'Halloween 5' is also seriously lacking in atmosphere and the darkness and grittiness doesn't come through enough because too much of the film is dull and descends into overly-silly camp. Again, 'Halloween 5' feels more of the same, the chilling scares, nail-biting suspense and the feeling of being unsettled. There is nothing creative or shocking about the scares or deaths, it's all by-the-numbers, over-familiar and indifferent. Everything is just too predictable and dull in pace to be remotely suspenseful.Stupidity is also all over the film. So many moments are intelligence-insultingly ridiculous and almost illogical. The characters mostly are very bland and annoying, especially Tina. High quality of acting and dialogue is never to be expected in a 'Halloween' film, but both are especially bad here. The script is so last-minute sounding and not even half-baked and outside of the aforementioned the acting is terrible.In summary, one of the worst of the series. Scary and thrilling are the two last words to describe this revenge. 3/10 Bethany Cox"}, {"rating": "4", "text": "A) Don't get me started on the whole mental connection angle. B) That Michael mask is just come on man. C) The magic is almost completely gone with this one... the body count rises while the tension-building is down to trace levels. D) The ending leaves you with some unreasonably heavy questions... questions which Part 6 proceeds to answer in the most regrettable way.+2 points for that Jamie chase through the basement (muted piano track and all...) it was a flash of brilliance, up until the finish.

Halloween 5 is Halloween 4's less original cousin. She likes to act like number 4, dress like her, walk and talk like her, but she is just empty inside. Plagued with the infamous rushed-studio schedule and weak script, Halloween 5 is a mess of a film. Shot and released within a year of part 4, we see Jamie Lloyd in a mental institution voiceless and unable to cope with the previous year\u2019s events. Briefly mentioned is the ending of Halloween 4, and it is explained away as her trauma. Donald Pleasance returns as Dr. Loomis, and the cast is rounded out by a group of unlikeable teens.

This movie just continues to bury and spit on the original\u2019s simple concept and story. None of these characters matter. This is around the time that Halloween went from being the slasher everyone ripped off to the slasher no one watches. They got worse with their kills, the one thing that kept the later slashers interesting, while they continued to add convoluted and nonsensical plot points. It\u2019s bad when movies by Rob Zombie can make your\u2019s look worse by comparison but that\u2019s what we have here. This movie, along with 6, represent rock bottom for this franchise.
