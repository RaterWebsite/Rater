I enjoyed every minute and Mila Kunis and Kate mcKinnon are great as two ordinary, very innocent ladies who get thrown into a spy feeding frenzy when a boyfriend gives one of the ladies an object that all the spy agencies in the world are after.  As Audrey and Morgan, they are subjected to all kinds of danger and come through in hilarious fashion.  McKinnon especially is so fun to watch as she hams it up as the crazier one of the teo.  Especially loved a Cirque type performamce McKinnon ends up involved in.  Lots of car chases, close fighting and close calls.  I thought the laughs were right on and I loved the chemistry between the two and their bond in the film.  Great fun with lady spies for a change.  I too will be hoping for a sequel!"

      "text": "Legitimately funny movie, but be prepared to watch it more for the jokes than the plot.In the first ten minutes, I had my doubts. The characters and jokes appeared obvious and tired. (Plus, the movie has one of those  relationships where you have two attractive actors, but somehow Justin Theroux\u2019s character is considered out of Mila Kunis\u2019 character\u2019s league.) However, when the spy stuff starts and Kunis and Kate McKinnon are whisked out of their everyday lives, things get really funny.There is a lot of great comedy to be mined here from having the characters go from one insane situation to the next. There is some shockingly, surprising stuff in here. The theater audience laughed quite a lot. The action is delightfully violent and over-the-top.Good cast overall, but the MVPs are Hasan Minhaj and Ivanna Sakhno. Minhaj is delightfully douchey as a CIA agent who can\u2019t stop mentioning that he went to Harvard. Sakhno is the assassin trailing them and she kills it, no pun intended. She plays the role entirely seriously as she plays the kind-of-odd and completely dangerous pursuer.As much as I liked this movie, it could have been a little shorter. It tries to be an over-the-top R-rated comedy and a BFF-road trip of discovery, and it never quite balances perfectly. It\u2019s not that I disagree with the character work, plus Kunis and McKinnon have great chemistry together, but they didn\u2019t need to spend so much time on it. Those scenes just slow things down. Plus, the film also gives McKinnon\u2019s character more comic screen time than needed, and it feels too indulgent."

The plot stars with some impressive stunts and chases, but it soon becomes more about interactions and silliness than action. The women have fun chemistry, but McKinnon handles most of the humor with her wonderfully wacky approach. Even so, the script doesn't provide enuff funny lines or situations. Ultimately, there's an upbeat approach that keeps it from sucking, but it's not sufficient to realize the potential hilarity of the premise.

I think this was supposed to be Mila Kunis' biggest feature, she has top billing in it, but sorry, due to the on-all-the-time \"Family Guy\" show, I can only see her as the voice of \"Meg\" and even here you want to say \"Shut up, Meg.\" This effort is tough to rate. It's got great production values but Meg, I mean Mila, and Kate are just junior varsity in this, they don't have the chops, the gravitas to play in the big leagues. And the film is conflicted in what it wants to be and that falls on junior director/writer Susanna Fogel. At times it's a comedy/parody - mostly when Kate is active, and at others it tries to be a spy drama, featuring a serious Mila. But she's out of her element, she wants to be a \"big girl\" ala Angelina Jolie or Famke Janssen but she's just too small and cute, like Sarah Hyland, ha, they could be sisters/cousins. She's a romcom queen, not an action star, and that just poisons the experience. And it doesn't help that she runs around in soccer mom attire for 90% of the run time. The Powers That Be gave these gals a chance, but it's clear we won't be seeing them losing anymore studio money on their own."

I think they should've edited out about 20-30 minutes out of it and it probably would've played better.I think in the hands of a better director, it probably would've been a bigger hit.  As someone who's from Freehold, NJ, I did like the reference there.  :)  But you can't judge a movie by that.  I still think the whole thing of everyone chasing after a flash drive is kind of lazy.  No one has a laptop?  No one has a way to copy the drive and then give it to people?Also with the fingerprint and the phone, before you cut off his thumb, did you think.... gee, I don't know.... maybe you could add your own fingerprint to the phone so you didn't have to carry around a cut-off finger in your purse?  Anyone who has had a phone with a fingerprint sensor could tell you that.But I think the twists that were in here were meant to be bigger than they came across as.  In Prague, that one was pretty good... but at the end, the twist was OK... nothing amazing though.Maybe it's me but Kate McKinnon trying to be funny is good in small doses.  It's kind of like Kristin Wiig.  She realized that her SNL schtick wasn't something people wanted to see all the time and she has had some good roles.  With McKinnon, it's funny to a point, but you get tired of it after a while.  When I saw the ending, I figured OK.... what's going on?  And I kind of knew who everyone was but I really didn't care.I still think that if you get a flash drive decrypted that maybe you should back up the decrypted files to the hard drive so you can have them later?  But no one really tries to even write down the password he gave to them...  I liked the concept but it was better than the previews made it out to be... but not as good as it should've been considering how good Kunis is."

Unfortunately, the thing they are selling is mediocre. If you replace this cast which has a great chemistry together with some other actors and actresses, this film becomes a solid 4 or 5. Mila and Kate are great together and really sell the best friend aspect of the film. There are a couple of missed jokes in my opinions, a forced love triangle of sorts that lasts three seconds. Not a lot of twists that happen and if, so they are predictable or so random and unpredictable that it just hurts the film in the long run.  Still a fun ride for the most part. Pacing is good if only to get to the next fun set piece. Some decent action and running gags. One bit with a CIA agent being very funny and almost genuine. Like they recorded a blooper real in character. The title gives away that Mila has gotten dumped by a spy, for the CIA, and an ex Machina device is found, and Mila and Co. find their way around the world to deliver it to the right hand with many hijinks throughout."

The characters are too unlikable to be a 'buddy' movie.There is nothing to recommend about this film.This is the second Kate McKinnon buddy comedy I wanted to like--and DISliked mightily.  After suffering thru two of these I have a guess what's off.  I believe the whole premise is in conflict with the role of women now, since 2001 or perhaps 2012 (such shifts happen gradually).  The healthy aspects of women's liberation was NOT to empower women to make and star in Road To... movies ala Hope & Crosby, or character-driven buddy fare like Laurel and Hardy. Those old movies are farce made by men about the farcical world males create, populate and sustain with tired genre tropes. What healthy roles women women's liberated to play?  To LEAD in replacing conflict and competition with connection, collaboration and win-win negotiation.  The LEAD in replacing war with diplomacy, in business especially.  We see women stepping into these new roles very few places yet in pop culture.   The clearest examples so far is perhaps the first Gal Godot Wonder Woman movie. In mythological terms that actress and that director  demonstrate the new role of women.  Wonder Woman aspires to defeat the God of War himself.  By the Wonder Woman standard, very capable women playing buffoons, in a world run by buffoonish men, in a buffoonish world, made by men living one sided lives, is a theme more appropriate to the 1930s, 1940s or the era of  James Bond parody films. In 2018 or 2021, the premise of this film, is out of step with the exciting directions women are evolving."
