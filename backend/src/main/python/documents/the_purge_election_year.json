That said, this is a return to form for Purge movies.  I loved the set up in the original film, it was a dark look at what could exist and reflected an elitism that we see everywhere in society today.\r After a rocky and somewhat race-based sequal, the 3rd film returns with a set-up of a presidential candidate wanting to see an end to the annual purge, and then trying to survive the night after the 'establishment' change the rules and try to have her assassinated.  The characters feel like they represent the #blacklivesmatter movement, and these are portrayed well I feel, completely aware that the system is rigged against them, not in a whoa-is-me way, but literally they are stitched up.  The female candidate as the lead is acted very well, and I really enjoyed her righteousness, right up until the end - no spoiler - but it hit me that this film is a pro-Hilary piece.  Rebublicans are almost outright Klan members, and it works much better as a story than the second film.\r All in all, it's a hoot.  An hour in I was hooked and it was a great thriller, maybe not so much a Horror film, but it was worth the watch"}, {"rating": "2", "text": "The third installment to a series that was never that good but made too much money on how underdeveloped the movies are. The movie is too over the top, cliched, dramatic in certain points and it thinks it's so funny but it's not. The movie had some nice action scenes and cool uniforms that the Purger's had. But yet again the movie does not live up to its ambitious themes and ideas."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "This Year, The Elections Will Purge Our Deepest Fears\r DeMonaco evolves its subversive franchise satisfactorily, the third installment of \"The Purge\" is concentrated in please the bloody craving of the public and the delight critical about socio-economic problems of movie critics, as well, it takes advantage of the political event shakes to the country, currently, and makes use of the popular July 4th for its pre-release.\r Despite carry one theme in common, James DeMonaco has emphasized to give own personality to every film and apparently, \"Election Year\" goes beyond in a nuanced plot and an absorbent atmosphere; It integrates new ideas such as criminal tourism, lack of legal protection to governmental personalities and, of course, the emphasis on the political and human atmosphere.\r Frank Grillo resumes his character from \"Anarchy\", the former sergeant, Leo Barnes, who leads the Special Security Group of the controversial presidential candidate, Charlie Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell), who proclaims and longs for the permanent suspension of the annual purge. \"No one else deserves to die!\", many people (usually, belonging to the less-favoured social classes - Florida -) defend and support her proposals, on the other hand, her adversaries plan to eliminate the root of the problem. They conceive a dystopian world embellished with bloody sequences of murder, nevertheless, this utopia is really close to stop being so. Roan obeys its principles and determines to spend the night of the extermination like everyone, inside of her own house, nevertheless, the protection is betrayed, so Barnes and Roan will be faced to save their lives, walking within a hell of flesh-and-blood. The Mission of Barnes: keeping alive to the senator, at the cost of his own life; The Mission of Roan: Playing clean and win the elections without the dementia from her competitors. After the 'home invasion', the film runs with intimidating and twisted sequences such as diabolical dances around hanged men in a lugubrious tree or families tied up to a car and cruelly killed with flails, a 'survival' better designed than in the previous installments.\r Annually, on March 21\u201322, 7 p.m. \u2013 7 a.m., any crime is legal, all health care center public is suspended until dawn. The election year brings along with the dismantling of the true aim of the apparent catharsis, liquidate to the poorest people (among them, some main actors) and absorb the capital of health insurance, pensions and others of the deceased people, illegally, enriching to  \"The New Founding Fathers of America\". The government manipulates the minds of the weak and they camouflaged their dishonest intentions as a need to cleanse their souls, Did their souls clean with violence?\r It visually striking, \"Election Year\" permeates visual hyperrealism, accompanied by a not-so-ingenious narrative; its potential to create the vulnerability effect that the senator feels and distressing atmospheres is provides by bright neon lights, masks with important personalities in the North American country, bizarre costumes, such as the wedding dress accompanied by the mask with saw-tooth, where reads \"KISS ME\", a brown bear disguise and even Abraham Lincoln's monument bathed in blood and burning in flames. Executioners celebrating the purification childishly, a muscular man soaked in blood, a extravagant decapitation through the medieval guillotine (excellent handling of lights), a parade of iconoclastic masks, gangs and redeemers theatrically represent a modest, but somewhat foolish treatment to such storyline.\r For the third time, DeMonaco raises the success flag, with a rooted manichaeism and representations of foreign ethnic groups, \"Election Year\" explores new and dangerous areas and goes beyond than its predecessors, with marked current themes and strenuous visuals,however, it is the script, which reaches the risible, even evident in the so unusual plot. As horror movie is predictable and regularly is transform in a Eli Roth's gore, nevertheless, it works pretty well like a sociopolitical thriller film, corresponding with these dates perfectly (election period, Hollywood has it all carefully timed). This year, \"The New Founding Fathers of America\" are waiting for us, though, apparently, we will have to purge with fervent desires in this final year.

It essentially does so by amplifying everything that worked in Anarchy, while avoiding it's misguided political and social messages.

There's a sense of shock and tension that was missing from the other two. Themes of human cruelty are still on display, this time more maniacal than ever. The deranged costumes of the psychopathic purgers and the well-crafted action make for a more exciting experience. When it comes to horror this is the best Purge yet.It's actually the best Purge all around. It focuses on the best aspects of the first two movies, while scrapping most of the problems. Writer and director James DeMonaco even handles his political and social commentary better this time around. A few familiar beats in the plot are noticeable. The bad guys have that oh so familiar tendency to go on pre-kill rants that last just long enough for our heroes to save the day, but it's got enough twists, turns, likable characters, and brutal violence to keep us going. If this is in fact the last chronological Purge, the series concluded it's story on a very high note.
