I am not a fan of slapstick comedies but this movie does better. Is it silly? Yes, Is it a little inmature? sure. Is it entertaining? Yes it is, very much so.

Ace Ventura hit the big screens in 1994, and showed what a comedic powerhouse Jim Carrey is. This film showed a new style of humor that emanated from young Jim Carrey. This film revolves around pet detective, Jim Carrey, tracking down a dolphin thief by using a jewel from a world championship ring to provide him with a list if possible suspects, football players. During the film, there are many memorable and iconic scenes that continue to make me laugh to this day. The facial expressions from Carrey in this movie are priceless, and all in all it is a great feel-good film. This films remains to be a classic Jim Carrey film, along with Dumb and Dumber. Fun to watch with the family. 7/10."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "It takes a lot of guts to stick to a role like the one Jim Carrey played in this movie, it would have destroyed most actors careers.

You will find that a lot of the reviews are from haughty snobs who are looking for the next Citizens Kane.  The movie was meant to target people in their teens.

It introduced a unique comedy with a ton of one amazing one liners."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "I can't think of a more annoying protagonist than Jim Carrey's Ace Ventura. The story is just one big headache and anxiety attack after another."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Critics will hate it.  But make no mistake, Ace Ventura birthed the modern comedy scene by being silly, disgusting, and outrageous.  Jim Carrey, an actor that needs no introduction, leads the charge and is the reason why superstar comedy icons found inspiration and room to get crazy on camera.  Before there was Zach Galifianakis, Will Ferrel, and Jonah Hill, there was Jim Carrey.  Only names like Robin Williams dare be mentioned in the same breath.  Only my parents could have ever found this movie forgettable."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "A goofy and funny material film for Jim Carrey's performance."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "I got a lot of laughs from this.

And today at 13 it is still a masterpiece!!!"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Ace Ventura is a funny classic and a bit pain in the ass .\" Jim Carrey gives us a  performance of annoying , Hilarious and a jackass in all his movies\" ."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "A typical good Jim Carrey movie that would never been greenlighted today anymore. You get what you expect: A great comedy experience with a hilariously good Jim Carrey. He has its own style that is not for everyone but really entertaining for many. He was maybe to often typecast with this in his career and nearly vanished until he saved his career with his exceptional performance as Dr. Robotnik in the Sonic movie (which I recommend by the way). This movie started a franchise with 3 movies (1 unknown TV adaptation which I just recently discovered and have yet to watch) and an animated TV series (vanished quickly and I know only a few episodes). Back to the movie: The title explains already a lot. Ace Ventura is a pet detective who saves / searches missing animals. He is an animal rights activists and critical of humans that threat animals poorly. He is Jim Carrey role eccentric, socially unadapted and his methods are unordinary (but successful). He is hired when the dolphin mascot of the Miami Dolphins is kidnapped shortly before the Super Bowl. For those who are not that much invested in sports I should point out that many athletes are superstitious and things like this have huge impacts on motivation and mental attitude. Just research the \u201cCurse of Billy Goat\u201d for example;-). With this the hilarious detective comedy starts. It is a solid story for a comedy. However the make or break point is Jim Carrey\u2019s performance. He is often dividing the audience. Some say he is hilariously funny and the highlight of the movies while others find him annoying and would rate his movies as trash. So this is what you must find out for yourself. For me I enjoy Jim Carrey mostly. There are some exceptions like Cable Guy and small missteps elsewhere. In this franchise I enjoy him as Ace Ventura as most jokes work. This is a fitting transition to the actors / characters, I already explained that Jim Carrey\u2019s performance depends on your own taste of comedy. He is either brilliant or awful for you (Strangely I have not found people in the middle-ground yet). Just as sidenote: He often gets positive and negative awards or nominations for the same movie. Then we have Courteney Cox as Melissa Robinson. She gives a good performance but has not that many screentime. Sean Young as Lois Einhorn is a movie character that would get the film canceled today. Wont say why because of spoilers. The rest of the cast works well but it is a Jim Carrey movie so his hilarious performance outshines their performance somewhat. Special mention for Dan Marino as himself. He is one of the football quarterbacks that is universally acclaimed, set records but sadly never won a Super Bowl. I think I don't need to talk about visuals or soundtrack here. Overall this was an enjoyable ride and I can recommend the movie if you like Jim Carry. I will however say the sequel is better. If you dislike Jim Carrey\u2019s humor / style I would advice to stay away from this movie and possibly from all his movies as it is not suited for you."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "While Ace Ventura:Pet Detective is not my favourite of Jim Carrey's movie, it is a lot of fun. It may be a tad too short, and some of the silliness is overdone. But even with any problems, that still doesn't change the fact that I enjoyed this film immensely. The film looks good with the cinematography and scenery top notch. The script is incredibly funny and I like to quote it too. The story is quite silly, but it is a nice one too, and the film is also very snappily paced. Tom Shadyac's direction is also very energetic and imaginative. This was the film that made Jim Carrey an overnight sensation and a fine one it is too to receive that honour. He is excellent in this film, his style of humour mayn't be for everybody, but when he is at his best he is funny or nicely understated as he is in his dramas. All in all, fast, furious and fun. 8/10 Bethany Cox"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Jim Carrey does not disappoint in this film, possibly one of his best works.

I believe this is his best comedic performance ever. But the humor itself in this movie is, surprisingly, quite witty and clever.In its first act and most of its second act, Tom Shadyac fully embraces the movie's goofiness and absurdity, thus generates some inventive and crafty comedy set pieces out of them.In the second half, everything goes gradually downhill. The plot begins to lose its sharpness little by little, as well as the humor, which ends up relying merely on gross-out gags and low-brow, dirty jokes. The movie also has its slow, and monotonous, parts; but this is not before it has delivered some very big laughs that almost made me choke.(7.5/10)"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I remember Ace Ventura being a far better comedy and I've watched it plenty during the first decade it was out.

It seems like he is doing is best to keep us entertained but wow, the rest of the cast, the story, the environment, the level of jokes are just insufficient. Carrey certainly oozes this insane energy but it contributes to make him seem totally out of the plot. Like an idiot in the middle of a regular village.If the beginning of the story is particularly childish, the rest of it totally falls apart loudly, becomes as confusing as it needs to be for Jim Carrey to deliver his pathetic jokes and impressive facial mimics.
