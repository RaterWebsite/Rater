He's acting like he doesn't care, and it shows, from his very first scene he looks bored and that never changes. The problem with Bruce's approach of not caring is this; if he doesn't care, why should we?Frank Grillo's always going to be a B-grade actor because he takes what he gets. I can imagine he turns down proper dumpster fire scripts on occasion, but for the most part I'd say he's in it for the cash. Although, he's hardly in this film.With those two being the main characters, I immediately knew it wasn't going to be a good movie. The story line is boring & nonsensical, the actors are bad to middling at best. The writer can't even properly weave exposition into natural conversations or set pieces. Here's an example:The scene opens with 'Guy 1' walking by someone smoking.Guy 1: No smoking behind the wire, specialist!Guy2: Yes, sir.Guy 1: I don't give a damn if your uncle is our boss or not.LMAO! The writer couldn't even be bothered to come up with a decent way to let us know this character (in my example 'Guy 2') was the nephew of their boss. Who wrote this dialogue?! This happens numerous times, why is it so bad?! Worst of all, Guy 2 later confronts his uncle to ask if he can join the war, he even goes on to say, \"you would send them off to war, but you wouldn't send your own family?\" lol why the heck didn't you leave it there? There was no need for the initial exposition if you were going to drop it in a scene later. OMG!Okay, there are plenty of instances of that happening, so I won't harp on it. Let's get back to Bruce. So, at the (roughly) 25-minute mark there's a scene between the main-ish characters - Willis, Grillo and a third person are all there. Each one is playing a high ranking official, but Bruce Willis is clearly not in that scene, he doesn't look like he's responding to them, he nods in their general direction as if he's in the room with them, but you can clearly see he's not there with them, they do no wide-angle shots... until they do! And when they do, it's a stand-in for Bruce LMAO it's clearly not him. It's so obvious! Their heads look so different! This happens several times throughout the movie, imagine paying an actor to act and they just go, \"Nope! But he looks like me, so....\" LMAO!Ladies & gents I could go on for a day and a half but let me stop here and say this... This movie sucks! any chance it had at being a movie (not even a good one, just 'a movie') was killed when Bruce Willis was brought on. I recommend you avoid. Don't waste your time.

The premise of the movie had promise. An alien species that is hostile and warlike with no willingness to negotiate. Of course it's going to be about us and them. However, the movie makers made a dreadfully bad movie regarding the annihilation of an entire species. Go watch Ender's game, which did a much better job of presenting a futuristic genocide of an alien species.
