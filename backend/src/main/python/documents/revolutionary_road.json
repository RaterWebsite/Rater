Life can be depressing! To assume that all films should be happy and void of emotions such as loss, fear, emptiness, sorrow and regret would make going to the movies a bore. Mendes is a master filmmaker and this ranks as one of his best works. This film is only for those who can appreciated the mastery of a genius director and actors at the top of their game!"

You feel the tension, hate, love and thanks to Sam Mendes, the killing blow which is the lie of the perfect american dream which can be found without problems. The film is so devastating andit will leave you sitting in your seat pondering the film, letting the feeling sink in...just like any masterpiece should."

      "text": "This is a top ten movie of the 21st century so far, and a top 100 movie of all time. Where do I begin? Very rarely have I ever seen three characters so well developed as in this movie. Kate Winslet plays an aging, failing actress, while Leonardo DiCaprio plays a former soldier, now working in an office, just like his father did. The two eventually gather up the courage to realize where their lives are, in comparison to what they thought their lives would've been like. Michael Shannon plays the son of a neighbor of theirs, who is the only person who understands their situation. He is seen as crazy, and even Kate and Leo's characters start to come off that way to their friends. Each scene is so realistic, and the more you can relate to it, the stronger the emotions are. I am envious of the life of the reviewer who said this movie wasn't realistic. I feel like everybody sees themselves as special. After all, we are the stars of our own lives. This movie is about realizing you're not. It's difficult to put into words. The poignancy of the movie should speak for itself. The fact that some people don't appreciate this movie makes the movie even more real to the people who do. Even though this movie takes place in the 50's, and is a commentary to what domesticity was like back then, it is actually timeless. There will always be people who don't understand how the life that might seem ideal to most people, actually can feel like a prison to others. The former are the majority, and the people who are lucky, and will not feel this movie's pain, or the pain of the novel upon which this movie was based, while the latter are the people who could be motivated by this movie to change their own lives."

I think Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are in top form here, and Kathy Bates and Michael Shannon are terrific in supporting roles. There isn't a single scene or moment that rings false. It's not a nice holiday movie, but a tragedy very well-observed by Sam Mendes."

Every credit in this movie is flawless and I am baffled by the Academys indifference to it. It is not a cold heartless movie but a tragically real and honest film."

I was deeply moved by this movie and it was extremely pressing for me. I felt almost nauseous at the movie theatre at times. It was very tragic, but sadly so true. Revolutionary road has a great cast and Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet have amazing chemistry on screen as we have seen before in Titanic over ten years ago. I was actually thinking that this movie is almost like sequel to Titanic. What if Jack wouldnt have died? I also want to give extra credit for Michael Shannon, who well deserved his Oscar nomination. In this world where societies norms dictate how people live their lives the only sane person was the the crazy person. So it raises the thought that was he even crazy or was he the only normal one in the whole film? Shannons character sums up the whole theme of the movie and he said all the things that people are afraid to say, or even think."

No, it's not a chipper romp, it's art. The kind that Kafka says we should seek to wound and stab us and act as an ax for the frozen sea inside. This movie stands at the opposite pole from the laughable tripe that is \"blah, blah Benjamin Button,\" against which it competes, and dwarfs with its scalding dignity."

The two characters in this film struggle with these questions. Not a happy movie, but pretty true to the soul of its subject matter. Most people simply won't like this movie because they prefer not to deal with these hard existential matters. I don't think anyone involved in the making of this movie was out to win a popularity contest."

      "text": "While I haven't read the book (which is supposedly a lot better) on which the movie is based, in contrast with the problems in the world you can't help thinking there is something contrived about April and Frank's desperation for a better life. Few people are doing what they dream about, but most stuff their disappointment, count their blessings and muddle on. In this case the couple have no financial or medical problems, two healthy children, and are barely thirty years old. Realizing (as in the case of the Kate Winslet character) that you will never be a great actress, and in the case of Frank a great something else (he admits he has no clue as to what that would have been), being a rite of passage makes it hard to sympathize with the premise that if they just moved to another country (with April working as a secretary and Leo becoming a stay at home Dad), their dreams would fall into place. I would have found the premise even more irritating had the movie not been so relentlessly depressing, from the first scene - to especially - the last. Cyanide pills all around - sheesh!"

An unbelievable plot, a hyper-exaggeration of suburban angst, with characterisations lacking in warmth and softness, the perfunctory callous sexual scenes unsizzlingly pornographic - as if all these things were clever or artistic to set out thus. I often like Kate Winslett's performances, in fact as she's a distant cousin I am predisposed to approve, but even that can't elevate this movie to adequacy. If you are contemplating suicide, breakup or mental breakdown, by all means go for it, it will nicely help you on your way; otherwise, do yourself a favour and stay away.How this ever got nominated for awards is amazing to me, a testament perhaps to the \"Emperor's New Clothes\" effect."

As it is, thank Kathy Bates for providing the only light refreshment as the one character who appears at home in her role. The delivery is stilted and stagey and the supposedly 1950's dialogue, set and props are rife with anachronisms, at times humorously so but more often just jarring (even a bad episide of 'Mad Men\" is more authentic). If you're intrigued by the possibilities of the wife's take on a well-worn Death of a Salesman theme, read the book; you won't want to after seeing the movie."

First, what must have seemed like shocking material in the '50s (adultery! abortion! -- all lurking just below the surface of affluent post-war suburbia) is ho-hum today. Second, Mendes is just too enamored with surfaces -- the movie should win costume and art direction Oscars -- to get at seem underbellies. As far as the performances go, you have to admire the chutzpah of casting the protagonists of one of the most iconic screen romances in cinematic history in these roles. But precisely because they have to overcome our expectations generated by Titanic, the performances call attention to themselves -- they are most definitely crafted -- in a way that I found distracting. Michael Shannon as the \"village crazy who speaks the truth\" has a pair of great scenes, but all said maybe Oscar got it right in largely ignoring this one."
