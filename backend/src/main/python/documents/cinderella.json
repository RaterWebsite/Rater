While Alice in Wonderland and Maleficent were re-imaginings, Cinderella is retold respectfully for the new generation.  I genuinely believe that Disney did something right with their latest live-action film. While most people were probably expecting a sword-wielding action hero, I'm happy that Disney treated their most beloved character with the uttermost care and respect. The story of Cinderella is very personal to each person who has felt like the underdog, but managed to rise like a Phoenix from the ashes in the end. If Walt Disney were alive today, I'm sure he would be proud to see his most treasured little savior be retold to the new generation in a beautiful and charming way. Bravo!"

I expected at least a bit more from this Downton/Game of Thrones mash up, but the cast could not save this film from the poor dialogue, lacklustre plot and lack of depth to any characters. This is a carbon copy, albeit prettier, of the original Disney film, with less singing. The costumes are the only redeeming feature, spectacular in their design, and I woudn't be surprised if they win awards. Otherwise, in a post-Frozen era, the film fails to engage the audience and it feels archaic, with no attempt to redress the glaring issues with the story for a twenty first century audience. 3.21/10"

Cinderella is a soulless cashgrab and it shows through the needless padding, lack of subtlety, and poorly written characters. The film goes the route of the Hobbit trilogy dragging tiny pieces of the original out to excessive lengths with the two minute prologue lasting a whopping 25 minutes. Cinderella quiet resolve is thrown out the window as the narrator talks the audience through her character and the villain loses her quiet intensity. The acting from Cate Blanchett and Helena Bottom Carter is good and the visuals are grand and impressive at times especially during the ball scene but the film does nothing to justify its exsistence or give me any reason to watch this verison when there is a perfectly good version. The Frozen short before this was meh but it was way better than this turd. Unless you are a little girl or a die-hard Disney fan save your money all you are doing is encouraging more lazy live action films that butcher classic timeless stories. It saddens me that we live in a world where a studio will make terrible unoriginal films and they will be a success to this extent.

Whether it be for the first time or the hundredth.\r The romance, humor, and all around sweetness make it a delightful and charming movie. Everything looks gorgeous. The costumes and special effects bring the magic to life. The whimsical nature of the animated movie is expertly captured. It shows that the magic fairy tales can be brought to life in live-action film just as well as they can be in animated films.\r I have to give praise to the movies fantastic cast. With actors from Game of Thrones being present among them we really could expect nothing less than excellent performances all around. Some might have preferred some new twists to the tale, but the romantic and god-hearted nature of it still make it a joy to watch even if many of us have seen it before. It's a wonderful adaption that can make for a perfect family movie."

      "text": "After the success of last year\u2019s \u2018Maleficent\u2019, both commercially and artistically, another fairy tale gets the revisionist treatment although with far less success. This Cinderella lacks any sense of originality, magic or wonder and is a disappointingly prosaic affair. The finger must be pointed fairly and squarely at director Kenneth Brannagh whose direction is by turns both lack lustre and uninspired. Early scenes of Cinderella enjoying time with her father are painfully saccharine and set the tone for the rest of the movie in which composer Patrick Doyle is unfortunately complicit. His cloying score must be one of the worst of his career and never comes close to equalling the brilliant work he has done in collaboration with Brannagh before on films like \u2018Much ado about Nothing\u2019.\rThe cast also, in the main, offer limp or insipid characterisations. Lily James and Richard Madden, as Cinderella and the prince respectively, are desperately lacking any chemistry together and it is ultimately left to Cate Blanchett as the wicked stepmother and, in particular, Helena Bonham Carter as the fairy godmother to keep any interest alive. Eventually even their amusing moments are engulfed by the dull proceedings and the sea of treacle that drowns any initial enthusiasm an audience may have. Ultimately, It is left to the visuals to provide almost all the enjoyment, and in this area the production design excels as do Sandy Powell\u2019s beautiful costumes. These two branches of film making are the true stars of what is otherwise a very safe and ordinary adaptation of a classic fairy tale that deserved a lot better."

To be brave and kind cannot mean to be a door mat to unworthy beings. And parents who show good judgement cannot lose it if they need to remarry. And of course, if the shoe fits wear it- but your waist must be a size two. At least they showed no discrimination when seeking out the fair maiden even though one was quite sure of her age, size and color. And how evil must her fairy godmother be to give her only a taste of the good life after all that suffering. Why at midnight must everything go back to usual - except for the glass slippers ?  How convenient. If only the prince need not try on the shoe. It would have made a world of difference.  Remake your classics-  but remember - for once upon a time is not now.

Cinderella is a pushover, who allows her stepmother and stepsisters to abuse her. This film basically says to young girls that it's okay if you're poor, if you're hot and nice, then some rich guy will rescue you. Lame. I really wanted to see Cinderella have some more attitude. I wanted her to rebel against her **** of a stepmother. Yeah, right. She just kept letting them walk all over her again and again and again. I don't remember being so irritated by Cinderella's passiveness in the original. Here, in this remake, it felt like Cinderella had more of a choice and she chose to be bullied. Is there something \"courageous\" or \"kind\" about letting yourself be abused? Hell no."

      "text": "This adaptation of the classic fairy-tale doesn't really present us with anything new compared to the previous versions; this is not necessarily a bad thing, although it becomes one if the sticking to the traditional storyline isn't backed up by some new element, be it the mood, the character development, the cinematography, the soundtrack; anything, really. Unfortunately, despite the accurate choice of locations (whose beauty is nevertheless helped by CGI), the 2015 Cinderella doesn't add any, contributing nothing to the history in film of this story. In other words, the cartoon version of 65 years ago is still the better telling of the fairy-tale.\r As I said, the cinematography and \"embellishment\" of scenery is to be applauded, especially the prince's castle I'd say,  but some things Disney can't ever get right in their live-action, and those are, for instance, costumes, which in this movie look cheap. Another thing they just can't swallow is the original ending of the original fairy-tale, in all its gory madness, which they still refuse to put on film.\r What's also strange to see is how critics have deliberately lowered their standards, maybe to condescende to the industry... I notice how \"A Cinderella Story\" from 2004, which was bad but at least an original adaptation, earned a meager 25, while this new Cinderella, while being essentially on the same level, gets a 67, providing it with a very underserved green background."

When I heard about the Disney's live-shot version is getting ready, I had a serious doubt, but not anymore. Nowadays, the filmmakers know how to pull it off a big budget movie with ease. Especially from Hollywood, if one market fails, it will raise in another as the recent example was 'Age of Extinction'. I am glad this movie met a great success despite it was not a surprise material as a story, but was as the quality of product.\r The movie runs nearly for 100 minutes, that does not feel too long as the narration had a wonderful pace. Everything was awesomely handled by the director of 'Thor'. It's a new era of the live-shot movies, which borrows the stories from the fairytales, folklore and classical animations. Recent 'Maleficent' was one of the great examples and this film as well enters the book of triumph.\r Lily James was very good, I haven't seen her much, because she's kind of a new actress in the spotlight. She's cute and adorable, I love to see her in many movies in the future. While Cate Blanchett, I never had any disbelief in her and she delivered it perfectly. An ideal movie for a family to watch at the weekend. I think children would love it, so at least watch it for them, with them.\r 7/10"

      "text": "Like it\u2019s protagonist, Kenneth Branagh\u2019s live-action adaptation of the Disney animated classic Cinderella proves to be little more than a dull, vapid mess covered up by a sparkly blue dress, and no amount of computer-generated mice, slapstick pumpkins, or good old fashioned Bonham Carter charm can save it. Once again, director Branagh shows that the only thing he does better than Shakespeare is soulless CGI spectacle.\rEveryone is familiar with the Cinderella story, and being that this particular iteration makes no effort to diverge from the tried-true fairy tale anyway, this critic shall not waste any time in summarizing it. To be brief, heroine Ella \u2013 Cinderella being a derogatory nickname cooked up by her endlessly irritating stepsisters \u2013 is left in the care of her heinous stepmother after both of her parents contract a horrible case of plot device and die. There is a prince, a fairy godmother, a slipper, and a happily ever after. The entirety of the story is narrated incessantly by Helena Bonham Carter\u2019s Fairy Godmother character, and while I do not mind listening to the sound of Ms. Carter\u2019s lovely voice for two hours, this demonstrates the film\u2019s absolute obliviousness to the tenant of \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell.\u201d\rTo Branagh\u2019s credit, it must not be easy to craft a sensible film while working off of such a droll script \u2013 under the pen of Chris Weitz, esteemed writer of such masterpieces as The Golden Compass and The Nutty Professor II \u2013 while simultaneously being wrung through the dread corporate machine that is Disney. Still, the composition of this film displays a surprising level of incompetence. People slide down doors in despair, slippers can be shattered by stepmothers but left unscathed by a tumble down the stairs, and the characters seem to feel the need to babble incessantly about their feelings.\rOur Cinderella is here a blubbering, counter-feministic clod who spends an inordinate amount of time either weeping or pining over her man. Lily James embodies the very image of a breathless, exhaustingly optimistic idiot with her constant empty smiles and flighty gestures. Ella lives her life under her mother\u2019s dying tenant to always \u201chave courage and be kind,\u201d which evidently translates to \u201cbe a cheerful and willing servant to your abusive stepfamily.\u201d Thus Ella is enslaved not only by her wicked stepmother, but by her blood mother as well. Ella puts blind loyalty to authority figures over her own happiness and well-being, thus becoming a perfect role-model to young women.\rSpeaking of wicked stepmothers, Cate Blanchett as the evil Lady Tremaine lends a subtlety and nuance to the role that might be compared to that of a bull in a china shop. Of course, how else can the audience tell that the stepmother is bad if she doesn\u2019t follow every act of over-the-top, wanton cruelty with a smirk and a malevolent chuckle?\rThe film\u2019s saving grace comes, unsurprisingly, in the form of Helena Bonham Carter, whose light and incredibly fun portrayal of Ella\u2019s Fairy Godmother makes for a very watchable ten minutes in the middle of the film. Carter fills the screen with her presence and certainly woke this critic out of his near-catatonic state of boredom, even making Weitz\u2019s trite, wooden dialogue feel clever.\rOf course when it comes down to it this was a spectacle movie, and on that end it lived up. The use of CGI animals was obvious and often unnecessary \u2013 I\u2019m sure that they still make real deer, Mr. Branagh \u2013 and the magic of the movie was unfortunately limited to the Fairy Godmother\u2019s standout scenes in the middle, but the effects were nevertheless detailed and fun to watch. The film was an absolute parade of lovely costumes designed by Sandy Powell, especially the endless supply of bizarre yet beautiful outfits worn by Blanchett. Patrick Doyle\u2019s score was grandiose and seemed to be struggling to carry the emotional weight of the film, as the actors clearly weren't making any effort to do so.\rIn all, this is a largely forgettable flick that trudges on through an uninspired and clich\u00e9d retelling of a story that has been told far too many times already. Without any fresh offerings or inspiring role-models, even children are sure to be unimpressed by this obviously mechanical piece of cold corporate cash-in."

      "text": "Another offering in a recent string of live-action adaptations of Disney classics, Kenneth Branagh's Cinderella manages to (barely) avoid feeling completely devoid of distinction, though it is still marred by a stifling loyalty to it's hallowed source material.\r Two things save Cinderella from the fate of lifelessness so often met by remakes of revered works: (1) The holistic embrace of an innocent, almost naive method of presentation, an approach that makes the proceedings feel intrinsically, and subversively, pure, and (2) an ensemble cast that lends surprisingly decent performances across the board (Lily James and Cate Blanchett deserve particular distinction).\r There are a few other elements of Cinderella that propel it ever so slightly beyond mediocrity. The dialogue is thankfully not entirely dumbed down for younger audiences, instead the screenplay is a verbose flutter of an almost Shakespearean vernacular (what more could we expect from Branagh?). There is also the production design and costuming, a bright confection of color and pageantry that invades nearly every scene of Cinderella and makes the picture at least visually stimulating.\r However, the aesthetic design ITSELF remains pretty run-of-the-mill. There are no stylistic risks or visual flourishes that deviate enough from the norm to make sitting through Cinderella on mute little more than simply palatable. Cinderella doesn't escape groan inducing familiarity either, with nearly every scene playing out with ENTIRE predictability. Some slight additions to the story only momentarily change the direction of the plot or, worse so, wind up feeling like needless detours transparently existent to avoid a xerox effect.\r There is also the nagging issues of the original story itself. Cinderella has always been, though colorful, resplendent, and respectably un-corruptible, a tale as devoid of legitimately engaging conflict as Disney's works have ever been. Cinderella is a sympathetic lead figure, and the injustice she endures from her step-mother is given new depth in this retelling, yet the tale still paints the evils of cruelty regrettably one-dimensionally, a move that feels hazardously old-fashioned and one Disney as a whole has been prone to make recently (the term I would use is 'risk-less reinvention').\r By no means an experience entirely worth rehashing, Cinderella still surpasses expectations enough to BARELY recommend, and only as a reluctant viewing with the family or a small child. And it goes without saying that the decades old animated entry is the superior version."

This was a breath of fresh air after unremarkable films like Alice In Wonderland, Wizard of Oz and Maleficent (partly). Thank god this was the best anime to live action transformation from Disney. Plus, Cate Blanchett, Lily James and Helena Bonham Carter were amazing in their roles."

I think Blanchette be an amazing Maleficent, They should use her in all Disney movies!!!!!?  Lily James is just fresh, natural , girly and did a great job. Great chemistry between Cinderella and the prince. I enjoyed it very much, and I gave wonder woman and Aquaman a 2 rating!!! It\u2019s a fairytale story, didn\u2019t disappoint."

Unfortunately the acting in this movie is forced, the script is somewhat cringe worthy and the cinematography is lacking."

      "text": "Whats most refreshing about this retelling of Disney's Cinderella is just how straight Branagh and co play it. Resisting the temptation to update the story or take a revisionist view of the material we are left with a beautifully crafted, handsomely mounted fairytale that will delight children new to the story and charm adults raised on the original animated film. Cast to perfection this version should stand the test of time and become a classic in its own right"

But it could have been much better -- hey, SNL\"s live-action Bambi was better.\rUnfortunately, what should have been the best part -- the clothes! Was the worst. Didn't like Ella's big debut ballgown which was a real letdown...nor the evil step-sisters dumb costuming, didn't even like the fair god-mum's cheesy wedding-ish look.\rNo matter how many times the movie dialogue tried to tell me the glass slipper was comfortable, I kept wishing they'd gotten manolo blahnik to design this. So clunky and ugly!\rCate Blanchett's evil step-mom started out kind of interesting but soon devolved into a Joan Crawford parody, along with her dreadful 1940s costumes. What was up with that?\rMy two main complaints were: getting hit over the head a zillion times with the moral of the story, be kind and courageous, captain. And, the over the top CGI. The story would have been way more affecting if the palace were a believable castle, out in the countryside, not some ridiculous disney mega-manse.\rI'd have liked it if Branaugh has gone with a grittier, more realistic style.\rThe prince, Derek Jacobi's king and Cinderella were pretty good renditions of these characters. HBC as the fairy god-mum was just OK, kind of meh.\rNo complaints about the basic storyline, no feminist rant here, it was a different time and place and at least Branaugh's Cinderella got to ride a horse."
