But if they default on payments, an organization known as the Union sends agents to repossess the organs. Remy is one of the best agents in the business, but when he becomes the recipient of an artificial heart, he finds himself in the same dire straits as his many victims.",

It is based off of the book Reposession Mambo (The same movie repo the genetic opera is based off of). It's not for the squeemish. I didn't find the gore anything excessive, but I have a super strong stomach. It's not a movie for everyone... But is quite enjoyable."

The switch ending was completely unnecessary, but overall, a much better film than I thought it would be. Gory - yes. Plot holes - yes. Worth seeing - Hell yea."

      "text": "Remy(Jude Law) is no romantic; no Parisian/Montmarte poet dreaming about a comely courtesean named Satine, as he hunts and pecks at a manual typewriter. He's not writing \"Your Song\"; he's writing about your kidney, your liver, your heart. Remy is a repo man, a murderer. If this futuristic government organized a tribunal for the medical crimes perpetrated by these blue collar killers, both Remy and Jake(Forrest Whitaker), and others like them in \"The Union\", would no doubt utilize the Nuremberg Defense(the glee in which the repo men go about liquidating a ship seems very Nazi-like), since they were only following the directives from their boss Frank(Liev Schreiber). Unwilling to take his wife's advice about taking a new position in the company, Remy, nevertheless, becomes nearly human again after a near-death experience. While on a job(he shows up at the house of a composer who is late on a payment for his heart), Remy finally faces the music when an occupational accident leads to an organ outfitting of his own. With his humanity restored through addition by subtraction, the \"heartless\" repo man can no longer laugh at delinquent clients who \"Cry [Him] a River\" at collection time. As Remy hears this Etta James song a second time, performed by a lounge singer/prostitute(?) named Beth(Alice Braga), he receives the lyrics like poetry, without the veneer of his profession's cooptation back at the nightclub, where the credo \"a job is a job\" was uttered. During a routine sweep with Jake, the repo man uses his stun gun on a child, but he can't finish the job. Unlike Chan-wook Park's \"Boksuneun naui geot\"(\"Old Boy\" is not the only Park film that gets referenced), this young boy is spared the scalpel. Although \"Repo Men\" degenerates into pure spectacle near the end, it climaxes with a spectacular display of masochism, clearly, a loving homage to Korean film, in which Remy and Beth consumate their love(for each other and for humanity) through pain."

The film is too dark, and the action is average. Oh yes, let's not forget about Jude Law. What can I say, a role that seemed to fit perfectly with the film, but the film didn't fit perfectly with him. If you have money to spare, see it. Although, you'll be forgetting about it soon after."

Forest Whitaker mumbles through his lines and you can understand about half of what he says, while the other leads have English accents. Jude Law did the best he could with the cluncky diologue and shows promise as an action star, but this was not the right vehicle for his action debut. Worst of all, I hated the manipulative ending that I won't give away. I've seen worse, and this one does have a few good moments, but not enough."

How ever there were some up sides like... Jude Law has a solid performance and the action in Repo Men was really new and inventive and I truly enjoyed seeing that. They didn't overdue the action which is probably a first in most movies, so thats what kept me interested. When it's all said and done the ending is pretty rediculous and you realize you wasted the last half hour (need to see movie in order to understand). Anyways it was a half way decent movie with solid performances and new action so with that alone I say \"Rent it\"."

If it's got problems with structure and restraint, well, it is in the satiric mode, and satires tend to sprawl and have never been much into self-discipline, or respectability. At a time the US Congress takes a year and (as of this hour) still can't put together a bill to pay for US health care, there's much to be said for a nasty slicer/dicer dark comedy showing a terminally nasty corporation selling organs with usurious loans. _Repo Men_ deserves to become a cult classic."

      "text": "This film is an uneven mix, starting off as a black comedy, shifts quickly out of funny territory and into stilted drama, and eventually finds itself stumbling into an action picture. The plot, which has been derided by some as a poorer, commercial version of the cult classic \"Repo! The Genetic Opera\" and dismissed by others as a barely more palatable version of the atrocious \"Repo! The Genetic Opera\" in fact bears almost no resemblance to the 2008 film. In fact, it owes much more to \"Logan's Run.\" If you saw that film, you've already seen this one, and seen it better done with more imagination. The main problem I had with the setup of this film is that there was no reason to believe that this would actually happen, that in an otherwise quite mundane world we'd allow people to kill each other on the streets for the price of their artificial organs. That wouldn't be a barrier if the film embraced it's early, satirical tone, but as it quickly attempts to take itself seriously, it becomes very hard to ignore the fact that the entire premise is utterly ridiculous. In the end, I can't make up my mind as to whether this picture is a poorly conceived critique of the health care system in the USA or an unnecessarily graphic action vehicle, but it doesn't ever quite work on either level."

      "text": "TLDR: Repo Men is a sci-fi thriller about the dangers of treating peoples lives, health and well-being become a commodity. It deals with ethics and morality, and while it never reaches the great heights, it is a solid movie with a surprise twist.\r Full Review: A movie set in a bleak future reminiscent of a Ayn Rand-esque society where money decide whether you get to live with the help of artificial bodyparts or die, \"Repo Men\" sets out to show us what happens when one those tasked with repossessing the organs that people can no longer afford the payments on, finds himself with an artificial heart.\r The setting is fairly clever, and it is a dark and cautionary tale of what happens when the health and well-being of people is treated like a commodity. The movie has a gritty and occasionally extremely bloody artistic expression, best seen in the disused housing complexes where those who try to avoid being killed and having their organs repossessed by the repo men. The violence is in no way toned down and there are scenes that will make anyone with a weak disposition feel ill, but this only adds to the feeling that the movie has a message about the ethics and morality of \"just doing your job\"\r The actors are a bit \"flat\", but this may be as much from their characters being desensitized after killing people and ripping their hearts, livers, kidneys and so on out for years, as from a lack of acting enthusiasm.\r The ending, which many have disliked struck me as a necessity. Yes, it angered me too, but without the last few minutes we would be left with a generic sci-fi action thriller, while this ending made the moral and ethical questions stay with me, and force me to think more deeply on the implication of this movie.\r It is not a masterpiece, but it is a good movie that has a message to us all.\r 7/10"
