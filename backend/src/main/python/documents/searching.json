      "text": "This clever title is entirely appropriate, since the father (John Cho) spends this film looking for his lost teenage daughter on line. Also, because this is a screen-based film (everything takes place on some kind of screen: computers, cell phones, etc.). This could be considered a gimmick (like Unfriended in 2015), but this has several things going for it. First, it's a well-written mystery that would work without the concept, but becomes even more interesting with it. The superb editing and innovative approaches to storytelling (plus Cho's performance) elevate this film into smart, creative thriller."

      "text": "Searching is a good film and entrenched through its acting, cinematography, directing, and story. How seemingly connective may our lives be with technology? What connotes depths of connection with furtherances of technology? In the film, documenting is a huge factor which is a habit that aids the recovering family though comes with emotional challenges for the documenter because the recordings are memories so easily and vividly accessible.\u00a0Throughout the film, the emotional experiences are so visible through the actors; agony, concealment, conceit, deceit, depth, shallowness\u200a-\u200a but so ingrained in the film as natural by the actors portraying these sentiments. What is character beyond the ever-present face of individuals receiving amplification because of modern technological developments? A subtle question I find in connection with the title and the development of the film is, what connection is anyone really searching for with so many different mediums available to connect with others? We're connecting in connecting on connecting through connecting with connecting, but\u200a-\u200awhat's really flowing between humans that draws humans to be so?\u00a0Each character in Searching has a reason for being in connection in their location physical or virtual; each character has their own path set and connecting becomes a very selective process heavily shown among the aspiring individuals in the film. Yet\u200a-\u200athere is an underlying connection in which everyone is shown in connection deeper than each of them might seem privately which proves that people care though with their own intentions\u200a-\u200athough I think even more so in recognition of a life and the meaning of the life in connection with their own.I think Searching is a really good film addressing some modern social concerns and I think the film's title is apt. I'll always be a fan of short films before feature length films. Writing a review about the film makes me ponder the last time I've read a mystery novel. Cyber security and virtual social networks are definitely matters for discussion. Safe environments, virtual or physical, improve social interactions. Tragedy is not the only thing that brings people together; I think tragedy makes people feel like they need to be more transparent about their connecting to ensure all connecting circuits are functioning properly so as to prevent any further tragedy. Yet, on paths towards improvement functioning parameters may always find positively-assisting  adjustments.\u00a0Virtualities will always be checked by tangibles.\u00a0Overall Grade: B+/A--K.D.If you're into Poetry and other bits of creativity, check out my Instagram: @Dufreshest."

You will stick around the entire time. The ending will surprise you, even the dark humor will surprise you (it\u2019s not a lot or uber dark).

Later in the evening in an episode of \u201cBallers\u201d there were sections of texts being exchanged. (An aside: television has to learn to fill the screen with a text so it can be read!)Today I saw the movie \u201cSearchers\u201d which, from beginning to end, takes place on computer screens, smart phones, face time chats, facebook, google, dozens of hook up sites, vblogs and anything that can be done on the social media sites of a desktop or laptop.The film opens with montages of David Kim (John Cho) and his wife Pamela (Sara Sohn) happily raising their daughter Margot (various actresses at different ages with Michelle La at the age of 16) until Pamela\u2019s death from cancer. Through FaceTime chat between father and daughter we see they are very close and are adjusting as well as they can.Margot does have a habit of forgetting her job of taking out the garbage and David, jokingly, affectionately, sends her picture of the overflowing kitchen garbage can and she responds, apologizing, saying that she will take care of it the first thing when she gets home from school.Margot doesn\u2019t make it home!Not wanting to give anything away, you know, spoilers, I\u2019ll just say it becomes a mystery with the father going through everything on his daughter\u2019s computer and phone to find her. There are a few red herrings but if you follow it closely and are good at solving mysteries you might get the answer.Along the way we meet Detective Rosemary Vick (Debra Messing) who is leading the investigation and has a teenage child of her own, David\u2019s younger brother Peter (Joseph Lee) who is more laid back than the older brother, along with schoolmates, teachers, chat room friends and people who claim they knew Margot more than they did.The only deviation from the Internet and cell phone are a few television broadcasts but I was really surprised how easy it is to hack a website that you may think is so safe.\u201cSearching\u201d is a decent mystery thriller told in a different form which will hold your interest. John Cho is the center of most of the screen shots and holds your attention whether it is showing the feelings for his daughter, his mastery of today\u2019s technology or showing the range of emotions going through him not knowing what happened to his daughter."

      "text": "social media satire that it whips you with..SearchingChaganty's nail-biting thriller is a real gem on delivering the crisp and the current social media satire that it whips you with. Considering it is his first major motion picture, Chaganty is a force to be reckoned with. His obvious gravels that are hard to chew, in its initial stages, is so flamboyant in the latter ones, that you are happy to let them go by, as you are practically giddy up for more of the sweat drop precision that amps up the charge. It is very well and calculatively constructed structure that despite of having a newer territory to explore, still follows one's familiar textbook formula; Chaganty went safe on that section. To create an entire picture that is fixated on a screen and tell a story through it, as much as that idea is appealing, it also is immensely difficult to pull off, since even though the technology has come far enough to give you quite a range to explore in it, Chaganty does feel short handed at times, and finds himself straining a bit on screen which is something that should not have been visible to the viewers but unfortunately it actually is.The subjective procedure of the investigation might be rudimentary but is immensely entertaining and thoroughly enthralling to encounter. The real romance of Chaganty's is how he weaves out a character out of tiny notions and objects, to an extent that you start caring for that object or a piece of message that it is carrying. The antics installed in this crime drama is something to be learned from, not only are they a huge supportive base of the plotline but also essentially the heat of the soul.The narration is not only gripping and adaptive but layered and thought provoking, no matter how itchy the short stories might feel like, they are crucial to the plot points. Obviously, there isn't much range offered to the actors to factor in, still Cho is delivering all he can from his guts; he makes you care for him. The supporting cast is a similar victim of the concept as Cho is, there is very little and in bits and pieces for them to do in so much time. The crust of the feature that it surfs through which is also its distraction, is thoroughly gripping and the makers have equally invested their time and sweat into it to be as convincing as possible.So these little notions or piece of informations keep giving us hope whilst the real trick is happening somewhere else entirely. The makers also plays with you subconsciously where they impute various ideas and innuendos on the screen for us to look at it as clues while actually all it does is throw us back from the real game. It is a very smart tale retold with a fresher perspective than we usually get, it keeps you tangled in its search. Searching may not be path breaking on terms of storytelling but as far as technology and cinema is concerned they are walking in parallel in here."

      "text": "Daily, parents are left traumatized when their teenage sons and daughters go missing, a reality that Searching covers all on a computer owned by a single father named David.It starts with a montage of his old home videos that he stores into his desktop files, including Margot\u2019s daily 5pm piano with mom. These moments appear sweet until his wife acquires lymphoma, her return home date delayed until finally getting deleted. Then before this thriller kicks off the thrills, the sound design first calms down the mood with a YouTube video of peaceful music that David plays. This creative choice implemented within the soundtrack works well to soothe before the storm. Then a screensaver fills up the entire frame to express time passage\u2014a phone call alert pops up, the dad is asleep, and boom: his daughter, Margot, is gone.After the production crew ensures realism to a relative\u2019s death, the far more private, personal side of it is shown instead of the outside assumption of what cancer is like. The haunts of the aftermath reveal themselves when David copies memories including Margot\u2019s first day of school and her first piano lesson, once cheerful memories now too painful to relive. Other instantly relatable moments include his constant passive-aggressive reminders for Margot to empty the trash. This appears on FaceTime by the way, which controls all the personal interactions in this feature, a much closer to home way of communicating than a mere ordinary scene would have accomplished. You may not know one of your close friends or relatives copy his home tapes to his other private folders, as David does, but there are many similar unknown facts about people you know, as this film addresses. In fact, people nowadays may as well not have a concrete identity anymore, since in this fictional case file, no characters are actually ever seen, just pixelated versions of themselves adapted to fit the social platform.You easily comprehend David\u2018s guilt, thanks to the gradually escalating score, one that establishes danger when he sees some guy with a hookah commenting on Margot\u2019s Instagram posts, including one eggplant emoji comment. Without the audio work, this would be just another account found on social media, yet concerning Margot\u2019s unawareness of this guy\u2019s suspected intentions; it turns truthful to how most sexual exploitation starts. Other tiny details express complete knowledge of youth culture from the committed screenwriters; during one conversation Margot has with a stranger online, she\u2019s asked her favorite Pok\u00e9mon; her answer is Uxie, a memory-eraser, the other says her favorite Pok\u00e9mon is Kecleon, which changes color to disappear. Amazing how those two Pok\u00e9mon choices fit perfectly what these two online interactors want to do to themselves!Although it\u2019s essential to bring up that this is the first feature film of director Aneesh Chaganty, and although he put in a good effort, he\u2019s still got room for improvement. If there\u2019s anything this movie is merely decent at rather than tremendous at, it\u2019s the rather overlooked world building possibilities from inside the restrictive rooms the FaceTime callers sit in. Not much is done to utilize the background elements to give crucial information about the characters, and the random use of color for the sets doesn\u2019t generate enough claustrophobia. When the screen is not focused on the FaceTime calls, an apparent lack of mastery in this type of space resorts to cropping in on certain elements of a webpage, which extinguishes the feel of being on your own laptop this film clearly intends.Though despite those rather minor criticisms, genuine stress still leaves an impact by the familiar circumstances, including when Margot doesn\u2019t answer her dad\u2019s many texts. In another scenario, it could mean a delayed response, but here, it could be she ran away. Just his typing speed alone sparks the clear injustice, especially when revisiting the account of David\u2019s dead wife, which hasn\u2019t been logged onto for 694 days. That is why the montage in the beginning supports the emotional impact so well, because after given a chance to cry, you thus genuinely hope to see David get back all he has left.But there\u2019s no predictability in his mission to find his daughter: once the direction seems easy to figure out, it changes suddenly and constantly until the tension concludes. The tension is all thanks to how the final edit mixes in news footage to resemble an FBI case file compilation, structured appropriately by co-writer Sev Ohanian (second feature film) so that you naturally want Margot to be found.To stop future crises like this one from happening again, parents and children likewise need to know what goes on with each other. Lack of availability can mark the difference between two crucial seconds, which means minorities nowadays should stop being so shut away from parents. Please do the same."

Through family photos and videos, we get to see the Cho's family from the birth of Margot, the fun moments with her mom and dad, her learning the piano and the struggles of her mom as she battles cancer. \"Searching\" begs the question, \"How far will you go to protect a loved one?\"The dialogue in the script is believable as we watch David Kim struggles to understand his now teenage daughter, Margot who spends a lot of time by herself. He doesn't know her friends and when she goes missing, he realizes that there are a lot of things, he doesn't know about her. Questions like why she hadn't been to piano practice for 6 months even though he's been giving her $100 per practice session for her tutor. And why did she withdraw $1200 from her account before she went missing? Was she abducted or did she run away? To find the answers David Kim must break into her computer system and get her passwords for the sights she frequented. Debra Messing plays Detective Vick, who is helping David Kim investigate the case of his missing daughter. \"Searching\" shows the dangers of social media and it is a movie that parents should take their children to see. It also shows how insensitive people can be even in tragic situations.The film takes us on a journey of today's technology, but overlook the simple importance of a voicemail. It does, however, drag the audience in as we are with David Kim every step of the way. I give \"Searching 4 Stars out of 5 for its clever twists and turns."

It really sets the fairly standard story apart with a different perspective as the times where the Father, played by John Cho, almost through his own eyes during the segments of discovery he has throughout the movie. It was pretty interesting to see as you could really put yourself in his shoes during his investigation because of the almost first person perspective. If only the story was a bit more interesting and not as cookie cutter as it came off as here. It's a pretty by-the-numbers affair and the ending could be seen coming from a mile away.

Despite some weak points here and there in the story, the plot is thrilling and intriguing enough to keep you wondering where the hell Margot is, and the plot twist comes in the end to quench the viewer's thirst."

      "text": "Trendy aesthetic gimmicks notwithstanding, it's the central story within \"Searching\" that really makes it as engrossing as it is. I had about five different endings going through my head as I was watching this narrative unfold and all of them ended up being proven wrong by the -- actual -- end. It's the incredibly coy, red-herring-ridden script that really pulls the audience into the circumstances at hand and encourages them to play detective alongside John Cho's \"Henry Kim,\" ultimately keeping them chomping at the bit for more clues as to what went down and what could possibly happen next. This is a really solid thriller with some dynamite twists and turns. And as for that aesthetic, I found it to be about 85% effective. As things get a little too big for the visual premise's proverbial britches, however, that's when I found myself checking out. But, again, this story is what ultimately keeps you in it from moment \"A\" to moment \"Z.\""

If the hero and villain in the movie had had closer relationships with their children, tragedy might have been avoided. The use of computer technology was expertly used to tell the story; which was quite suspenseful, but the ending was, in my opinion, a bit off; i.e., if a 'slow' child causes an 'accidental' death, committing murder to cover it up doesn't make much sense. All in all, a very watchable movie, but great it ain't."

      "text": "At times, this film was a decent and entertaining thriller, but other times it came off as made-for-TV quality to me with mediocre acting from some. John Cho however makes the most of his starring role and turns in a pretty solid performance. I was already a little reluctant going in to begin with given the premise of it being mostly on a laptop screen, because films like those always seem cheap and only halfway decent most the time. And while this did make interesting use of the concept at times, for the most part it didn't bring a whole lot new to the table. The film also started becoming a bit convoluted and I had to suspend my disbelief with certain things towards the end as well. Overall, interesting enough gimmick, but I personally found the film predictable and with more cliches than I'd like to admit."

      "text": "A slow-burning, intense thriller that has more twists and turns than a winding mountain road. The film's unique narrative format -- done entirely on computer screens with video cams, web site windows and pop-ups -- presents its material using an entirely new cinematic vocabulary, opening the door to an inventive new way of telling stories on film. It also offers viewers a potent cautionary tale about the pitfalls of cyberspace communications and what we can actually believe about the identity of the individuals we're supposedly communicating with. An overlooked award-winning gem that, thankfully, is finding a life of its own on DVD and other home viewing options."
