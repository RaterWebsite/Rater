Cruelty to animals, realistic CGI animals or not, is always wrong and having it so graphically portrayed in a movie propagates those actions into society, making what they show more likely to happen in real life.

When Bobby (Washington) and Stig (Wahlberg) rob a bank filled with forty million dollars they find themselves hunted by multiple parties keen on getting their hands on the exuberant payday. Making matters worse is the fact Bobby and Stig aren't exactly being honest with each other about who they are. A fast paced, unrelenting joy ride through a simple but entertaining story that uses played out action tropes to tell its tale but manages to keep the proceedings thrilling despite some of the generic pratfalls. Washington and Wahlberg share some great chemistry as they sink their teeth into witty dialogue that Washington proves he is more than willing to take advantage of. The film doesn't take advantage of all its assets as Paula Patton is underutilized as Bobby's ex partner despite an interesting introduction filled with some completely unnecessary nudity to boot. Sure the films key demographic is young males but the film seems to be begging somewhat with the addition of dick jokes aplenty and the prerequisite pair of jubblies. That being said, 2 Guns is damn good fun, a breezy crime caper that while not entirely harmless is light on real consequences. Finally its a film worth watching for the shocking fact that Bill Paxton, an actor written off by most (including myself) gives a stellar performance as Bobby's adversary and CIA spook, a cruel sleazy and all around disgusting wretch of a human being  so wonderfully repulsive he bring the film to life whenever he appears and Paxton nails it. Ultimately its a smooth ride worth a watch not only for a taste of Washington as a comedy actor but also for Bill Paxton (Never thought I'd say that.)"}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Starts quite well but can't really sustain that level for the other three quarters."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Relies heavily on chemistry between its talents and quintessential gunslinger bravado, 2 Guns excels with classic explosion and slow-mo bullet dispenser moments. Mark Whalberg and Denzel Washington are well cast, they seem comfortable in their roles and exhibit the action oriented partnership patented in the late 80s. However, the story might have some inconsistent rhythm and convenient coincidental occurrences that could hamper the experience, considering it tries to put quite a few twists along the way.\r Story revolves around the two main protagonists, Robert Trench (Denzel Washington) and Michael Stigman (Mark Whalberg), who are undercover DEA and undercover Navy officer, respectively and unbeknownst to one another. Each plans to rob a bank for 3 million dollar and pins the deed to the other. They eventually find much more than they expect in the vault and will be hunted for this abundance of cash by drug lord and other shady organizations.\r There are arguably many angles to cover, especially since the perspective shifts quite a lot.\r The movie does a decent job of stringing these events together, but there are some cases which seems overly rushed. Timeline is used in a back and forth manner, locations could be identified more clearly. These sudden changes may perplex some viewers who aren't accustomed to crime action movies.\r For a movie that focuses mostly on the duo, Denzel Washington and Mark Whalberg deliver. They are fun to watch, give life to compelling characters and legitimately look compatible. It's good to note that Whalberg fits more in rugged debonair with quips as he doesn't revert to his confused face too often. Denzel Washington is as charismatic as ever with somewhat threatening air at appropriate times.\r Bill Paxton as the corrupt agent shows capable eerie remorseless performance as a corrupt agent. Paula Patton gives a certain feminine touch, although a little less quixotic. The stars are aligned and script is suitable to the theme. There are some lines that could sound overly childish, but for most the dialogues are aptly written and properly delivered. Expect some violence every now and then, mostly intimidating grunts and point blank shots, common bread and butter of gunslinger movies.\r The movie has certain heist and conspiracy flair, even though they are sadly not utilized too effectively. It's also nice to see some degree of variation so the movie isn't all mindless bullet-fest. Ultimately, it thrives on old school appeal of underdog vagabonds with lots of ammunition, and in this case, isn't necessarily a bad thing."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "...and the surprise winner of the year goes to 2 Guns! The only reason I decided to watch this film is because I am a huge Denzel Washington fan, however my expectations for it were extremely low. It's rare, but occasionally, a preview can harm the reputation of a film, and that's what happened here. The previews make this film out to be nothing for than a big gun fight with the occasional cheesy line, but it's so much more than that. In a unique twist, two undercover agents, from two separate agencies, wind up going after the same man. Looking for a way into his organization, they find each other and assume the other works for the bad guy. Both Washington and Mark Wahlberg create characters and put on a good show for the other, having no idea that they're actually working towards the same goal. What really makes this film work is the chemistry between Wahlberg and Washington. Denzel is plays his usual level headed, super intense character, while Wahlberg's playing a laid back, reckless guy, who actually does have some pretty funny lines, that they weren't about to show in the previews. Together they go through on an amazing adventure, full of good guys and bad guy crossing and double-crossing each other. There are at least a half dozen factions tied to this evil man, in different ways for different reasons, and each representative is more unique than the other, leading to some amazing interactions. 2 Guns is the story of 2 agents caught in the middle of a huge conspiracy, that seemingly involves every one. While that may be confusing to some, I found it refreshing, because the truth is you never knew what would happen next. When one side struck, it could have been anyone, for any reason. The unique story and large supporting cast, paired with the terrific chemistry between the two stars, made for an absolute classic that fell under most peoples radars. If you're looking for a good movie, that will have you on the edge of your seat, then you should check out 2 Guns!

In addition, to their chemistry, I did not mind the script. The plot was terrible, but I thought the script was largely pretty well-written and really served as a good foundation for Wahlberg and Denzel. However, in saying that, the plot was indeed terrible. Outlandish and completely unrealistic, it sucked all the fun out of the movie watching this preposterous plot unfold. Baltasar Kormakur is better than this, as are Wahlberg and Washington.

Don't anticipate a hard-hitting drama or an edge-of-the-seat thriller because the real focus of the movie is on the ever so slightly humorous relationship between its two main characters: Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg. Both interact well enough together, but the film falls flat when they're separated, and sometimes it's for long stretches. However, director Baltasar Korm\u00e1kur shows a great deal of improvement over the last time he worked with Wahlberg in the disappointing, and uninspiring \"Contraband\" (2012).\r \"2 Guns\" is about a pair of undercover agents, neither of whom is aware of his partner's real identity. Bobby Trench (Denzel Washington) is a DEA agent and Stig (Mark Wahlberg) is Navy Intelligence, but both are playing the role of a legitimate crook. Their mutual goal is to take down the cartel headed by Lord Papi Greco (Edward James Olmos). Their plan to do this, which is never really explained in a way that the audience can truly understand, has something to do with robbing a bank where Papi's money is supposedly stashed in safe deposit boxes.\r After the robbery takes place, however, it comes to light that the stolen money belongs to the CIA and their enforcer Earl (Bill Paxton), and he wants it back. The DEA intends to use it in a trial against Papi because getting a search warrant would be too much of a hassle. Naturally, our heroes end up being targets for what they know, having to finally work together to piece together your standard run-of-the-mill double cross extravaganza.\r The real business of \"2 Guns\" is the camaraderie between the two bickering leads, which comes across a lot like flirting. They finish each other's sentences, order each other's breakfast, chat about \"Les Mis\u00e9rables,\" and even have a scene where they stroll into the sunset arm in arm. There are chases, shootouts, and explosions, but there is nothing here you haven't seen before. With the exception of the final shootout sequence, the cinematography rarely impresses. There is limited amount of fun had in watching how Bobby and Stig survive a variety of seemingly inescapable situations, but sadly the predictable plot keeps getting in the way of all the action.\r The elements gel well enough to make \"2 Guns\" an enjoyable summer cinematic experience. However, it is never any doubt how things will play out, and it's nothing likely to resonate after the dust has settled."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "2 Guns is really only okay, just like Contraband. Unlike Contraband, it's really not that interesting. It has good action sequences that would be made even better if tied cohesively together into the plot.

I'm not trying to post my own political opinion here, but it felt like there were multiple plot points where issues paralleled hot political topics right now. These were then resolved with a liberal standpoint. For example: The ridiculous plot structure of having both a very corrupt and money lusting Navy/ CIA (On top of the cartel). Each of these organizations betrayed their single agents because they stood to reveal their bad nature. In turn, the \"2 guns\" went rogue and committed acts that would be deemed 'terrorist.' Of course, the audience is supposed to root for them, so everything they do is ok. This was just one of the political topics hit out of many I saw, including the debate on welfare (The ridiculously long and unneeded scene where they argue over tipping), and the morality of betrayal in relationships (Denzel and the Latino chick.) I saw others, but they don't come to mind. Maybe I'm just flipping out over a whole lot of nothing, but I still don't see the point in having a plot that tries to carry so many different things in it.

Buen negocio sin riesgos tomados."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Great action flick. Denzel doing his usual swagger thing that kinda gets annoying ya know? Mark doing his usual thing of fists and guns. and James olsmos doing his usual thing of being a bad ass."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "There's not much to say about 2 Guns. With such a poor script, Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg can't really be blamed for giving mostly charmless performances. The main plot \"twist\" comes out of left field and is absurdly random to the point of just being stupid, which pretty much sums up this movie. It's filled with guns and death but that's about it."}], "recommendations": ["shooter", "angel_has_fallen", "the_mechanic", "the_last_stand", "contraband", "16_blocks", "the_italian_job", "the_equalizer", "safe_house", "gangster_squad", "the_november_man", "sabotage", "the_commuter", "demolition_man", "spenser_confidential", "escape_plan", "wrath_of_man", "21_bridges", "honest_thief", "free_fire", "the_taking_of_pelham_1_2_3", "jack_ryan_shadow_recruit", "3_days_to_kill", "red_notice", "mile_22"]}
