Had the studio been willing to spend more on the movie, they could have had a really great, watch-it-multiple-times movie. Instead, it was worth seeing once on Netflix or a similar service. I would be pretty excited for a sequel based on what the last few minutes of the movie hints at, though."

      "text": "I admit I didn't expect much going into this, given the mixed reception.  But I actually left very entertained.  The story is loosely based on the old tale of Jack and the Beanstalk and while it for the most part stays true to it, it doesn't feel like some lazy copy from fairy tale book to movie script. But at the same time it didn't feel like a pathetic try-hard attempt to make a fairy tale \"edgy\" a la Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters.  It hits a nice middle ground that's able to work well on its own merits.  In other words the story isn't a rehashing or butchering but rather a reimagining.  The characters, while not particularly unique or original, do work in the roles they're given. Even if the whole lower-class-guy-meets-upper-class-girl thing is kinda done-to-death, especially when the latter is royalty, and you know very well how the story's gonna end in that department.  Also I like the idea of there being practically a whole other world within the beanstalk, rather than just an hour of climbing, which I feared the movie would be at first.  It makes for a lot of great visuals and action scenes.  Speaking of which, the fight scenes are very well-written/performed. Some notable ones (no spoilers) are the one with the giant chef and the one between Jack and Roderick in the stream.  The giants, aka the \"villains\", have a nice design to them.  And while I wouldn't say the CGI was amazing for them (especially in the close-ups) it worked well enough.  Though they were clearly the most \"cartoony\" part of the film.  One other thing I appreciate is how just when you think there's a cheap linear storybook ending about 3/4 in, it (somewhat realistically) continues in a way that would otherwise leave a massive plothole.  And I think it pays off quite nicely, with the final battle making for a great scene that really hooks you in, ending on a creative and kinda funny note, depending on your sense of humor.  Overall Jack the Giant Slayer exceeded my expectations and was very entertaining, albeit with a fairly predictable storyline and main character arch.  It's not a tear-jerker or a laugh riot but more of just a fun adventure.  I'd give it a 77/100.  It probably won't end up my favorite movie of 2013 but it is for now."

With thrills, spills, and chills, Jack is a good adventure film that successfully modernizes its' fairy tale basis while lovingly nodding towards the classic tale.\r Great visuals and acting by the cast, with the stand-out being Ewan McGregor, who brings an Errol Flynn-like personality to Elmont.  There's a few good messages also on embracing responsibility, bravery, and self-sacrifice.  As far as a family movie night is concerned, Jack the Giant Slayer is a very mild PG-13, but I wouldn't recommend it for children under age 10.  For while there is no on-screen blood or gore (the head-chomping is off-screen and the effects are seen from a distance), it still could spark a nightmare or two for younger ones.  There's also a bit of mild language and giants are seen having gross habits.\r For a more detailed review, visit www.moviestakenseriously.blogspot.com"

      "text": "Here's a storybook retelling by Hollywood that isn't completely rubbish. Jack the Giant Slayer stands proudly on the verge of decency, but doesn't really achieve greatness either. It is a stylized version of Jack and the Beanstalk that caters to more contemporary viewers. With the help of its stars, it provides a more palatable reinterpretation of fairy tale, although the script doesn't really shine. Effects are good throughout, gigantic creatures may have been digitally constructed before and while the giants here don't rewrite how they should be portrayed, they do have more humane motions in an attempt to include them more as characters and not mere monsters.\r Nicholas Hoult as Jack is an appropriate pick. He doesn't stand out as the heroic type, leaning more towards an urchin type of protagonist. His love interest Isabelle, played by Eleanor Tomlinson, is a princess who longs for an adventure. If I didn't know better, I'd say the first few scenes are from old RPG game, and truthfully. It starts slow and predictable, almost overly clich\u00e9. This is a movie that has slow beginning but eventually builds up to more interesting sequences.\r Stanley Tucci, Ewan McGregor and Ian McShane are no strangers to fantasy movie, these veterans are charming and act their parts ardently. They give more color to the otherwise wanting movie, I personally like Ewan McGregor as he steals the scenes even only as supporting role. Writing is somewhat inconsistent, some dialogues are corny and seem forced, and for those who aren't, they are decent at best. The pace is brilliantly tight however, the scenes are set in hasty fashion, not prolonged mundanely, and they are chained together fluidly.\r Action is integrated well, the ones towards the end are pretty amazing. It has compact and comprehensible battles, things happen quickly in sorted recognizable order, it's a good trait to have, considering the numbers of people involved are plenty at times. The use of 3D is serviceable, camera placement for the action are tailored for it, although not in invasive way as most 3D movies do. The switch to first person view briefly at some events is a nice touch.\r Wardrobe for the cast deserves credit, outfits are medieval yet seemingly have modern ambiance to them. Armor designs fit the theme, the characters look fine as each respective garment insinuate their personality more. Jack the Giant Slayer is a movie which isn't overly epic, it does have some issues and doesn't really make for a grand journey. However, the solid acting and good pace will likely amuse audience."

But it's the beginning of March and there's still no new releases for me, the only movie I want to see is \"The Host\" and \"G.I. Joe: Retaliation.\" Jack and the Giant Slayer, I'm not sure what the movie's all about killing giants and..sorry Jack, but Buffy is still the undisputed queen of vampire slayers. The movie was okay, but maybe the action scenes were a little too frightening for the little ones to see. The script looks like another one of those bad fairy tale movies (Hansel  Gretel: Witch Hunters is one of them) starting to take over the box office and well.. you get the picture. Another year, another mediocre so-called \"Slayer\" to start the March season, I think Jack the Giant Slayer is going to be one of the biggest flops of the year. Maybe it could match John Carter's terrible run last year."

At points it was a comedy, but sometimes it was a serious adventure, or a fantasy war movie, and I don't know what they were thinking with linking it to real life. As well as that, it wasn't even consistent with who it was made for. The plot was too simple for the older crowd, but too violent for the children the plot seems to cater for. I also found that not many people have much of a motive. Why did the obviously evil guy keep killing his teammates? Why did Princess Isabel run away from a moderately reasonable request from her father and king? There were some good points, like the action scenes and the character of Jack, but not enough to justify more than a 5."

      "text": "The special effects are good, the 3D is good.  The giants are inconsistent in size.  When we first meet them they are as tall as the trees.  When back on earth they are smaller, and the head giant that falls into the castle moat is way smaller still.  There is no way the giants they show at the beginning would fit inside a castle to run around chasing Jack.  There are also some ludicrous moments  the audience actually groaned and laughed at a couple of them.  The worse one involves a knife fight where Jack's head is pushed underwater and his lost knife comes floating back to his head, and he grabs it with his mouth and stabs his opponent.  Knives do not float, they sink.  And try stabbing someone with your mouth while your opponent is on top of you pushing you down.  Another bad moment involves the tug of war with the rope at the castle.  It would only take one or two giants to easily win that battle, yet an army of giants can't pull the wall back down!  In the meantime, they are so strong they are uprooting trees that are on fire and easily throwing them over the wall.  Yet another stupid moment is when Jack throws the bean down the giant's throat.  The giant has picked him up and is about to eat him.  Apparently he eats in VERY slow motion which gives the bean time to do its magic.  In the end I think young kids will like this movie, but adults will be rolling their eyes a lot."

A lot of the plot points have been done before, and better, in other movies. The movie gets point for its fantastic special effects that rivals the works of Peter Jackson, but that means nothing when the special effects aren't used in an entertaining experience. The action, the plot, and the humor all falls short. The cast does a good enough job even if there is some overacting from some of the supporting cast. Ewan McGregor's performance is especially entertaining and he's easily the best character in the film providing just the right amount of silliness and seriousness. All in all the movie just isn't that enjoyable and I don't recommend it. Better pass on this one. It tries hard to ride its beanstalk up into the clouds, but in the end the whole thing manages to come crumbling down."

      "text": "Yet another fairy tale re imagining that sounded interesting but upon execution left much to be desired but oddly enough not in the ways you would expect. When Jack (Nicholas Hoult) is given some magic beans by a monk he thinks hes been swindled but then the resulting beanstalk causes his house to ascend into another realm along with a princess he must travel up to rescue her and prevent the giants from coming down. As a film its a puzzle because it seems like the film's climax seems to be in the wrong place with the 3rd act disappointing the first two. Bryan Singer loves telling stories about outcast heroes and Jack is a gripping protagonist as he is someone you genuinely like, hes a charming, naive oddball of a hero. On his adventures he is joined by Elmont (Ewan McGregor), a knight sent to rescue Princess Isabelle (Eleanor Tomlinson) and it is clear that McGregor relishes his character's comedy. The films best quality is its ever mutating tone while managing to stay interesting and family friendly. The film is stuffed full of comedy to provide levity to a story that is filled with dark elements. The giants are dark and twisted but they are also entertaining in their large bumbling way. While the comedy tone makes for a fun watch, the movie lacks depth or any kind of real emotion or heart and when the film shifts in the 3rd act to allow for a stereotypical finale it loses its unique character. It's one of the few films that has an epic final battle and it isn't really as good as the conclusion at the end of the 2nd act. The visuals are outstanding with the land the giants inhabit being both beautiful and menacing. The giants themselves look gruesome but with individual personas to entertain, the chef giant is a particular highlight. Overall its an inventive and funny film but never really grips you to your seat in the way an epic should and the final act disappoints both in terms of gravity and tension making for another flat ending."

It won't win any awards or be remembered, but that doesn't matter, it provided the core reason we go to the cinema, to have fun and to be taken into a different world. The acting on all fronts was actually good and really brought the film to life, I went into the film fearing it would contain really mundane acting that drains the life of the film, but I was proven wrong. It was silly and never took itself too seriously, which is really the only way the film could have succeeded, it's a film about Jack and the Beanstalk for crying out loud. The bottom line is this, if you're looking for a fun family film that you can just watch, Jack the Giant Slayer is a good way to spend an evening. The reason I have not given the film a higher rating is because it didn't blow me away, it just took me by surprise that I actually enjoyed it. Fun, 74/100."

The film gives new meaning to the word bomb, as it cost the studio approximately 80 million dollars! The goal of this film was ambitious, but the problem was that it completely misses all of it's target audiences. The writers wanted to take the story of Jack & The Beanstalk and adapt it for more mature audiences. Parts of it almost seemed like they were looking to make it an epic adventure, like the Lord of The Rings, but the Lord of The Rings it is not. The problem with this film is that while they built up the intensity, they didn't go far enough to make adults want to see it. On the flip side, with all the added death and violence, it garnered a PG-13 rating, which meant that younger kids weren't going to see it either. Personally, I liked what they did with the story and I think Nicholas Hoult is a terrific actor, but the way they wrote this film was just a disaster waiting to happen. When they build up the suspense and something is about to happen, they don't show it, because it would be too intense for the kids. When they go the comedic route, the fart jokes, bees in the helmet, and gigantic bad breath is a turn off to the adults. At times I felt like I was watching a kids movie, while at other times I felt as though I was watching one of these three an a half hour epic trilogies. The film couldn't decide how it wanted to go and as a result, it didn't appeal to very many. You can't argue the fact that the film bombed at the box office and I think you can't argue the fact that it did so for a good reason."

This film's story is nothing special, just an adaption- even Walter Hill or James Cameron can do a book movie. It's good when you see it's speciality in action and special effects and coolness but nothing special."

The story is bland, clich\u00e9, predictable, boring and we've seen it all before in other movies.\r In today's day and age, we expect that good special effects does not a good movie make."

      "text": "Entertaining and enjoyable, but nothing groundbreaking or spectacular. A lot of drawn out and dull scenes which lose your attention and takes far too long for action to start. However when the action does start, it becomes better. The scene with the beanstalk growing in the house was very boring. Overall, it cames across as any other kids fairy tale romp film and generally forgettable, but not to bad."
