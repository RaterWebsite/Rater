Enamored as he is with anthologizing The New Yorker from its Paris days, he has little to say beyond the fact that he is a great fan. And though that does count for something, it counts little in terms of engagement beyond a moment's delight with the passing scenic designs that slide and shift without cessation. Anderson has many admirers, to be sure, but I can't count myself as anything but one who gave it a number of opportunities to 'get it' and didn't."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I think Wes Anderson films are all about style; I can hardly remember the story of some of them.

And, to his credit, he even manages to serve up a film that is often charming, witty and funny, elements often absent from his pictures in light of his substance-over-style tendencies. But this is still another example of close but no cigar. In this homage to old school foreign correspondent print journalism/reportage, told in a series of vignettes, Anderson gets it right about 50% of the time, despite the movie's superb technical and artistic accomplishments and its fine performances by a glittering all-star cast whose members obviously had a great time making this picture. It's a shame, however, that the filmmaker, in his typical manner again here, never quite manages to pull it all together to create a finished product that fires on all cylinders. Diehard fans of the director will no doubt love this release, while the average cinephile will likely come away impressed by its celluloid eye candy and modestly amused for its eccentric, if not always spot-on storytelling. Maybe one day Anderson will live up to his potential, but, based on this outing, he still has yet to do that."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "An extremely funny, ironic and rather melancholic requiem for classic modernism and its belief in art, love, humanism and intellectual discoveries.

This film focuses on 3 separate stories and all of them are great in their own way but some are definitely better than others. I\u2019ll rank them at the end. All of the performances are great with my particular favorites being from Benecio Del Toro and Jeffrey Wright. Every cast member is fantastic in their role although I wish we saw more of Owen Wilson and Bill Murray. As always, the production design, cinematography, and writing are top notch. Although I like the more streamlined writing of his other films, Anderson does a great job at juggling three different stories here. Some stories are more interesting than others though and that kind of diminishes some of the other ones. I also found this film to be really funny as well. There were a lot of moments were I found myself laughing especially in the first and third story. The third story even goes through an animated segment and while the animation looks rough, it\u2019s intentional. It\u2019s truly something to see on the big screen.

An excellent cast evokes nostalgia for a time and place I've never been. The middle article, underutilizing the talents of Frances McDormand and featuring that insufferable kid from Dune, was rather weak, but overall this is another artistic home run for Wes Anderson, with lots of laughs and his strong writing in full force. While it never reaches the heights of \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\", it's the best movie I've seen since \"Pig\" and a more than worthy entry into his catalog. It's also the first time I've actually felt his artistic flourishes get in the way of his storytelling, as the constant changes in format, color, and even aspect ratio can be jarring from time to time - a minor complaint that I'm sure will be remedied on repeat viewings.

He creates a colorful ensemble with a wild yet intricate imagination. However, like some of Anderson's previous works, 'The French Dispatch' is intricate to a fault. Unlike his previous outings, 'The French Dispatch' actually feels like two hours, twenty minutes longer than its runtime. There is so much witty dialogue that made me feel as though Anderson was deliberately trying to stretch time. While I appreciate his approach for standing out, I feel as though 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' had a far more grounded story that helped drive the plot rather than drag the moviegoers along. It's still a smart and well-acted film by an impressive ensemble, and I would recommend it to any film buff or Anderson fan.

The movie stretches out its runtime to the extreme. The stories are charming, surreal anecdotes that would make for great short movies, but fail to create a thematically coherent narrative for a feature film. The French Dispatch is lovely to look at. Anderson's signature style is delivered flawlessly - it feels like the movie belongs in a modern theatre. The attention to colour is outstanding among modern filmmakers and the camera work is never just there - it's actively telling a story (if you remember the ratio change at the end of the painter story, you know exactly what I'm talking about). It's a real shame Anderson is a visual artist first, and a storyteller second. The French Dispatch provides no food for thought and leaves your head as soon as you exit the screening room."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "The latest outing from whimsical cult-favorite director Wes Anderson sees the chief of a popular journalist column known as The French Dispatch of the Liberty, Kansas Evening Sun passing away suddenly, prompting a look into their last issue that takes a look at some of their stories over the years, ranging from a death row inmate who falls in love with and frequently paints one of the guards while finding himself at odds with an eager art dealer, a young man and his relationship with a much older journalist while he's writing a manifesto in the midst of a school-wide revolution, and another journalist who finds himself in the midst of a kidnapping/hostage situation involving a young boy. Anybody who's familiar with Anderson's directorial style will surely know what they're getting into with this, as he seems to fully embrace his signature whimsy and charm more and more with each new release of his, and this film is certainly no exception to that. Zippy dialogue and zany and colorful set pieces are plentiful here, with just a twinge of absurdism mixed throughout to create just the right blend of humor and intrigue. The film also uniquely and cleverly makes use of several aesthetics without coming off as gimmicky, such as switching back and forth between black and white, playing around with aspect ratios, and even switching between live action and comic book-style animation on occasion. As for the cast, it's stacked with a-list talent as you can see on the poster, and it's impossible to single anybody out since everybody here is just so enjoyable and endearing to watch! Those who know Anderson best will recognize his usual players, such as Bill Murray, Adrien Brody, Owen Wilson, Tilda Swinton, Willem Dafoe, and Edward Norton just to name a few. We also get some great supporting turns from the likes of Francis McDormand, Benicio Del Toro, and Timothee Chalamet to name a few more. Story-wise, there's plenty of entertainment enjoy to be found in each of the segments throughout the film. Really my only note would be that it feels a little TOO Wes Anderson-y, so those who aren't a fan of his or his style likely won't be won over with this film, quite the opposite probably, cause he's definitely not for everybody. Overall though, well there's not much in the way of story or narrative here, the cast is a delight to watch, the stories are all unique and enjoyable in their own way, and Anderson is in full command of his trademark aesthetic and style here, for better or worse."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Good !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "A great return to form in my opinion with Wes. With films like Darjeeling and Grand Budapest, it felt like Wes was more focused on aesthetic than compelling story and characters, and had just become a caricature. This film doesn't stray from the now neo-classic Wes look, but broken down into vignettes, it allows for multiple stories which is totally what saves this film. Before you get consumed by Wes-isms, the story changes, and each one has it's own flavor.  If Wes continues to make films look the way they do, I might advise that he keeps going with the vignette format, because it truly paid off in this, what I consider a very formidable and fun comeback film.  His best since The Life Aquatic if we're only doing live action. Best since Fantastic Mr. Fox if including animations. The cameos weren't rubbed in one's face too hard.

Same goes for all the performances.At the end of any of his previous works, I always took a favorite character with me. On this one I just couldn't.The French Dispatch is a lot of style and hardly any substance.It's all Wes Anderson, but for the first time it feels like an Anderson lacking in creativeness and insight.He's like a magician who has exhausted his repertoire.
