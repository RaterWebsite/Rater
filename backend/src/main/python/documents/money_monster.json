I thorougly enjoyed Money Monster, but it's nothing that I would write home about.  It's a full on, dirty and suspenseful thriller that offers much in terms of acting and storytelling.  While Kyle holds Lee at gunpoint, the entire city outside is in chaos, not only from the fact that a hostage situation outside, but from what Kyle is saying as well.  The whole controversy around the stock market and this supposed \"glitch\" that took everybody's money was interesting to learn about, even if it is complicated.  The acting was spot on, Jack O' Connell executed the best performance of the movie; his constant mood swings and loud personality gave me chills every time he would tell some body to be quiet.  The movie had a solid soundtrack, great characters, and an interesting story that makes you think about real life economics and the government.  It's a solid thriller overall, but as I said before, it isn't anything special.  It's a very good movie, but there's nothing in particular that blows your mind or surprises you.  In the third act of the film, you can pretty much predict what will happen at the end of the movie.  Also, the only thing that stands out about the film is that George Clooney is the star of the film; I felt like if it were any other movie star, the movie would lose it's charm.

But gradually this movie built up a head of steam and some real tension, and both George Clooney and Julia Roberts were very good. I think Jodie Foster did a good directing job, and I enjoyed this film, but I also think it could have been a lot better \u2013 funnier and more suspenseful and more biting in its message. Spike Lee\u2019s film Inside Man had a much better pace, for example, and the satiric edge was more cutting in The Big Short."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "George Clooney returns for another plain film that intends to solve its own mystery before we can even figure out the case.

It brings nothing new to the movie screen but it holds your interest, is a decent thriller and shows two stars at their best along with a supporting cast doing just that by giving strong support.\r The plot sounds very simple but the financial dealings aren\u2019t! Kyle, played by Jack O\u2019Connell, takes flamboyant TV financial host Lee Gates, played by Clooney, hostage while the latter is doing his live show, which Patty Fenn, played by Julia Roberts, produces and directs. Kyle makes Lee put on a rigged bomb vest and threatens to take his finger off the detonator unless it is explained how he lost all his money on a tip given by Lee on his show, which was blamed on a computer glitch.\r The company is owned by Walt Camby, played by Dominic West, a favorite actor of mine, whose communication director, and his mistress, Diane Lester, played by Caitriona Balfe, is in the dark about many things regarding her boss. Some of the best scenes in the movie are between Balfe and Roberts.\r Christopher Denham as a producer wanna be working with Patty has a role underwritten but played well by him and offering humor. Lenny Venito as the lead cameraman on the show, Condola Rashad as an assistant and Emily Meade as Kyle\u2019s girlfriend all make an impression with their time on screen.\r George Clooney is his familiar, wisecracking, mugging self at the beginning and growing stronger as he tries to bind with Jack O\u2019Connell who delivers a difficult role easily. Through it all Julia Roberts is the focus and main strength of the film.\r The screenplay by Jamie Linden, Alan DiFiore and Jim Kouf keeps the suspense going, gives the actors some funny bits and tries to look at all the aspects of Wall Street and how the financial world works but do their best keeping the dealings between Clooney, Roberts and O\u2019Connell at a high level.\r Though the film was suppose to have been shot in real time, a few scenes, outdoors, had to be fudged here and there. Jody Foster, as the director, keeps the tension going, the actors moving briskly and efficiently entertains. Though anything you can say about a thriller will be a spoiler Foster only did two things \u2018wrong\u2019, one regarding Roberts which is a personal spoiler for me and another regarding giving some information just a beat too soon.\r \u201cMoney Monster\u201d delivers any expectations a movie-goer could want and will certainly satisfy fans of Julia Roberts, George Clooney, Jodie Foster and thrillers."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Walking into Money Monster, I expected it to be uneventful and boring.

The performances are universally excellent, the script is superb, and the storyline is one which is satisfying and saddening, with a number of well crafted moments which surprise.

Featuring reliably solid performances from George Clooney and Julia Roberts, the real star here is Jack O'Connell. The next big thing in film, O'Connell continued his tour de force through the acting world with yet another truly powerful performance here in Money Monster. Unhinged, yet entirely emotionally vulnerable, O'Connell shows incredible range in this film that really allows you to feel incredibly sympathetic towards his character. As for the film as a whole, it is a well made and entertaining thriller/drama. It is never too preachy, but is quite conventional and your run-of-the-mill blend of thrills and emotion. That said, Money Monster's well-directed, well-acted, though capable of far more than it amounted to. As it stands, it is a conventional film that more than entertains, but never tries to be anything more than it would up being."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Try and disregard the prevailing critical message on this first directorial foray into the mainstream thriller for Jodie Foster, for the film remains a wildly entertaining, genuine thrill ride from start to finish. Indeed, \"Money Monster\" is as much a magnificent testament to the power of filmic tension as it is a riotous showcase of the respective dramatic talents involved. And thanks to a carefully-handled message and a killer final act, the film ultimately soars above expectations, delivering an almost completely satisfying cinematic experience."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "What if the experts are wrong! And how it affects the common man!\r Jodie Foster did wonderfully as a captain of the ship. She could have acted in it, instead concentrate only on the direction, so that opportunity went to Julia Robers. With George Clooney onboard for one of the main roles, this was one of the best team to work together, as well the film was very enjoyable. So better than what I thought of it and I feel I should have given a better rating. But one thing is for sure that it was made for the people to have a good time, not for the critics morons.\r A real time narration, takes place in one normal morning is a newsroom studio where the financial expert Lee Gates, going to give his advice to the investor where to put their money. But the show suddenly got hit by an intruder when he takes the host as a hostage. He demands some answers from him regarding what he'd said a week ago in the same show, which led him to lose all his money. With this kind of complication how its going to conclude was nicely told with some edgy scenes towards the end.\r Both, Clooney and Julia was good, but it was Jack O'Connell who hand upper hand. He has done some great films lately and now this, I hope he continues his good work. It was inspired by the real glitch that saw in the stock market, but altered to suit the cinematic, especially turning it into a crime-thriller with some powerful characters to deal such an interesting situation made big differences in its success.\r The writing was good, because, it was kind of realistic like what a common man do and his intentions are when he can't understand the terms the experts speak or give the reason for the loss. So there are some pauses like 'what next' kind of stuffs that intentionally did. Despite a serious thriller, there are some funs. Whom you're going to cheer is up to you, but it keeps your head up all the time with its fine pace and developments. This is not the best among you find from this year, but surely a good watch if your purpose is entertainment or timepass,\r 6/10"}, {"rating": "6", "text": "It starts as a weak try at showing a different side of the despicable business world by using a tv program as a way of doing something \"different\".

After Gates tells his viewers to invest in IBIS Clear Capital, the company experiences a 'glitch' in its logarithm and its stocks plummet; costing shareholders $800 million. But not everyone is satisfied with this explanation. Holding Gates responsible, Kyle Budwell (Jack O'Connell) sneaks onto the live show's set and holds Gates hostage; armed with a gun and a bomb vest strapped to Lee. He invested his entire life savings in IBIS and he wants an explanation for his loss. All broadcasted to the world on Live TV, Lee and his director Patty (Julia Roberts) must get to the bottom of the financial crisis before the gunman completes the unthinkable. Espionage, danger, and corruption ensues as everyone does their best to deal with this delicate situation before it's too late...\r I know some of you will be turned off watching this movie due to the financial jargon, and while it would be beneficial to have knowledge of such jargon before you watch this movie, it isn't compulsory to still gain some enjoyment from this film. It beautifully captures the outrage of a stock market collapse combined with the delicacy and tactics of a hostage situation. However, I feel as though Clooney's natural charisma and lighthearted disposition takes away from this delicate situation a little, appearing somewhat too calm under pressure and therefore lowered the stakes.  There's also a reveal about 2 thirds into the movie that decreases tension as well, but from the exterior stays the same. What works best for a movie like this is the tense ambience that keeps audiences on the edge of their seats, and sometimes it went astray from this central ideal. That was where the plot lost me. But when it does have those tense sequences, boy do they do it well... There were also some moments when the plot moved a little slow. This could've been fixed.\r The main cast was few but quality; George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Jack O'Connell, Caitriona Balfe, Dominic West, and Giancarlo Esposito were among those involved. Julia Roberts was PERFECTION. By far the stand-out in this one. She had the perfect manner for someone who would have been dealing with a situation like this in a role like hers if it were to happen in 'real life'. Fantastic. The others all performed, I think, to their expected standards. Clooney, to his credit, expanded his repertoire for this role, but you can definitely see the normal Clooney shining through. I appreciate the effort by Director Foster to blend together differing genres of Comedy and Drama/ mystery. But unfortunately, unlike the unusual blend of Comedy and Horror in The Visit, it didn't work in this form. It degraded the dramatic appeal of the film which was stellar at times.\r The script, soundtrack, and cinematography were all very good and contributed to that tense and dramatic ambience that audiences feed off of. With some luck there will be some award nominations- it certainly deserves a few. To improve, less focus on trying to maintain a lighthearted ambience within a very serious situation, and try to invent more fresh plot twists to invigorate the drama and keep the plot moving quickly. The movie's underlying purpose I feel was to send a message about financial decisions to the target audiences while blending it into an engaging storyline. This was successful, I walked away from this movie knowing that corruption is everywhere and that I should spend my money wisely.\r To finish, I enjoyed this movie a lot. It had some fantastic elements and strengths, but the biggest thing for me as I've already stated that brings down this movie is the attempt to forcefully blend wildly contrasting genres and their moods into this film. Some characters were nonchalant while others were deadly serious. This movie needed to focus all its energy on its strength; dramatic tension."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "I guess when they rate it R they can use the most filthiest language that they can think of.

Every minute is tense and keeps your eyes glued to the screen. George Clooney and Julia Roberts both provide great performances and the ending is rather unique. However, this film also tries to say something about Wall Street and the media. Rather, Wall Street is bad, corrupt, and full of greedy people. The Media is cynical and only cares about making news flashy, rather than properly reporting it. Also, that the American people are being ripped off by the corporate system. This is where the film falters. Instead of taking a strong stance on these issues, the film handles all of this more or less as satire and the topics themselves are oversimplified. For example, instead of explaining how Wall Street works, the movie simplifies it to \"it's bad and full of greed\".
