This film brings back the wonderful joy of the adaption that calls this film's attention and it's even better the why-do-you-think-this-was-a-great-idea-at-all live-action/animated Smurfs movies. Even if this is so, don't be completely expecting a great film from here to the movie's complete end (which is supposed to be the credits that follows the film). Smurfs: The Lost Village is possibly one of the best Smurfs films you could receive in this decade and for now even with its horrid mistakes they kept from the previous Smurfs films. I mean, at least you have someone to thank for the removal of the real world in the world of Smurfs. Watch if you completely dare, but don't expect this one to be winning an award or even being nominated for one whatsoever. I can't say all the mistakes this film has because that's spoiling it and it's not fun when you spoil the best parts of a film. To end this with a short diagram, Smurfs: The Lost Village is a huge improvement but the huge in the improvement is not present due to the many mistakes this film contains."

With no Neil Patrick Harris and Katy Perry involved, it doesn't even need a reboot and unfortunately, Smurfs: The Lost Village is just as boring as the other 2 films. But hey, at least we still got Alvin And The Chipmunks. As for The Smurfs, I believe this franchise is already dead & buried. Thanks, but no thanks Sony."

      "text": "An adventure to unleash the secret.After an average reception for the first two films, I did not expect one more in the series. They should have been dropped it, yet the film was not that bad. It was simple and cute, somewhat better than the previous ones. Basically, there's no story, everything was an adventure and the story came out of it. The adventure of four Smurfs to outdo their arch-rival, Gargamel. They were racing to find the secret village, but with different agendas. They had to face many hurdles before getting close to their destination. After that what came was a surprise. Not for us, but the Smurfs, and following, the story ended with the result of the battle that fought.From the director of 'Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarrom' with prominent actors behind the voice-over. Not one of the most expected animation of the year, but some people were, like the kids. The children won't go alone to the theatres, it always has to be with parents/elders/guardians. That is a complicated combination, and the filmmakers has to work on that. Which means making a film that can be enjoyed by them both. So this film is more a children's, but surely some grown ups too can enjoy it. Otherwise, it is a decent film, that's not deserved the poor box office respond it's got. That means, show it to your kids, even if you are not interested in it. That's how it should be!6/10"

The animation and sound is amazing. And of course Eiffel 65 had to be in the soundtrack with the classic eurodance track Blue. If you love some light entertainment and Smurfs nostalgia go watch this."

      "text": "Due to the live action versions being quite bad, no one expected much from this version. However it is more smurfy and more like the animated series from the 80's. Since they're actually in their own land throughout. Being magically transported to New York and then Paris, was just stupid.There's just a strange dirty joke thrown in when Papa Smurf (Mandy Patinkin) and Smurfwillow (Julia Roberts) are trapped in a cage together. He says \"time to rock the cage\" and she says \"don't make it weird.\" Although, my 13 yr old niece and I laughed hysterically at that. While Rain Wilson's Gargamel is so hyperactive you'd think Jim Carrey was voicing him.Otherwise the voice actors are better than the cast from the other films. It's especially funny that Gordan Ramsy talks for Baker Smurf despite rarely being shown. While of course Michelle Rodriguez talks for the tough girl smurf named Smurfstorm. Jack McBrayer is probably the best cast as Clumsy. While not as good as the show. Smurfs: The Lost Village is at least superior to the Neil Patrick Harris films. Well due to actually being watchable."

The story is rather engaging, the animation is absolutely gorgeous and the characters, as generic as they sound, are really funny. The only problem is that the film rather wants to play it safe, which takes out most of the tension. But thanks to the clever writing and gorgeous animation that stays true to the spirit of Peyo, it becomes worth a watch."

The trailer is hosted by an emoji named Meh, voiced in the morose observational tones of comedian Steven Wright; in just 30 seconds, he makes not being overly enthusiastic about anything seem the apex of hilarity. I won\u2019t prejudge the film, but it\u2019s a stupendous trailer.Then we get to the Smurfs movie, which has a hundred characters who are Smurfs, and not one of them is as funny, or wry, or distinctive as Meh. You might describe the Smurfs as blueberry Hobbits crossed with knockoffs of the Seven Dwarfs \u2014 or, more precisely, of Dopey, since they mirror his innocent leer of a grin, open-car-door ears, and hat that\u2019s like a folded-over blob of Poppin\u2019 Fresh dough. (I do realize that the Smurfs were created in Belgium in 1958, and that their headwear was meant to evoke the Phrygian cap, which signifies freedom. But they still look like Dopey.) As with the Dwarfs, the Smurfs have names that describe just what they are: in this case, Jokey, Nerdy, Grouchy, Brainy, Clumsy, Nosy, Hefty, Winner, Loser, Painter, Scuba, Paranoid, Therapist (\u201cSometimes,\u201d says a patient, \u201cI just feel blue!\u201d), and Table-Eater. Unlike the Seven Dwarfs, the Smurfs, even with their Defining Traits, seem to have more or less interchangeable personalities. They\u2019re one-note elfin mascots of cute who are all, in essence, variations on the same product.Last November, when \u201cTrolls\u201d came out, a number of critics described it as being sort of like a Smurfs movie. Well, it kind of was \u2014 but if so, it was the \u201cCitizen Kane\u201d of Smurf movies, a kaleidoscopic disco fantasia with marvelously individualized troll-doll characters. (I\u2019ve seen it three times and could easily watch it again.) \u201cSmurfs: The Lost Village,\u201d by contrast, is a sweetly benign fantasy for three-to-seven-year-olds, and though one should show no hesitation in calling it innocuous, because it is, I do realize that\u2019s all part of the design. It\u2019s not a rousing animated comedy that parents will cherish along with their kids. It\u2019s more like a colorful and diverting pacifier."

      "text": "Smurfs: the Lost Village is a rather competent film that strays away from the 2 god awful CGI/Live Action Cash Grab Films known as \"The Smurfs\" and \"The Smurfs 2\"While I didn't exactly grow up with the age demographic of most Smurfs Fans, I do remember watching a lot of the episodes on Boomerang as a kid, and all I can say is The Lost Village is an almost proper reboot/revisit to the Original Animated Smurfs cartoon. The Lost Village, unlike the blatant cash grab films is set in the same world as the original, with many of the same concepts kept untouched, or very slightly but elegantly altered. The only gripe I'd have is that the lore of this film somewhat throws out season 5 of the Smurfs, for example it's known that Smurfette isn't actually a real Smurf in both the show and film, but the show there is really only one actual Female Smurf (Nanny Smurf) and 2 Magic Made Smurfs (Smurfette & Sassette) However in the CGI Movie we have a whole Tribe of natural Female Smurfs when Smurfette was thought to be the only one even if she was made with magic.Essentially The Lost Village stays true to the original show but only if you exclude season 5 and after. But what they do with excluding season 5 is a really neat concept all on it's own. If you know just a bit about the Smurfs then the film comes across as an expansion of the original show, but if you are pretty well educated about Smurf Lore then this comes off as a different Universe entirely that can still spark that bit of wonder.The film also has plenty of interesting visuals and quality animation, but tends to lack in a lot of the writing and world. There tends to be a lot of obvious puns that are based off of the one dimensional smurfs, granted there isn't really a whole lot else you can do with characters that are intentionally designed to be 1 Dimensional, All Smurfs are personified by one single aspect, this makes it easy to write easy jokes, but it doesn't allow much character building. The only character who actually changes, or at least comes to terms with what she is is Smurfette, and even then she has no clue, there isn't an exact aspect to Smurfette's personality, but with her being the main character, character development doesn't seem to be that big of a deal in the film.Now I've seen some reviews claim that the film is using Feminist Propaganda, and I can't really agree here, I understand that there's a focus on powerful female characters, but it doesn't feel overly forced, it really fits in with that universe expansion, and really it rather makes sense for the Female Smurfs to be a force to reckon with given the setting of their village, the film builds up that the Forbidding Forest is a dangerous place, then throughout the film our protagonist Smurfs do end up having a difficult time in this unknown land. It wouldn't make any sense if the Female Smurfs were peacefully living pleasurable lives in this harsh environment, they fit in with the harsh environment by living a harsh lifestyle. Overall I think Smurfs: the Lost Village is an alright and competent revisit to the Smurfs, but could use some fixing up. And if Sony is ever going to reboot any other old classics, I hope this is how they do it, instead of cash grab crap like the 2 CGI/Live Action Films."
