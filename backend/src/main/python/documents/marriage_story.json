Everything about this film blew me away. Adam Driver and Scarlet Johansson have turned in career-best performances. Laura Dern is a revelation, and Ray Liotta is quite good too. And then there\u2019s writer-director Noah Baumbach, who truly has outdone himself (I have not seen all of his films, but this is by far the best that I have seen). The direction is outstanding. Perhaps the most exceptional quality of the film is the writing, which is truly ingenious. Not only is the screenplay really moving, but it\u2019s also hilarious; I laughed out loud frequently. I also love how unpredictable and quirky the screenplay is, which serves to make the action and dialogue more realistic, believable, and endearing. The writing and direction remind me a lot of Woody Allen, yet Mr. Baumbach manages to forge his own unique style. This film also reminds me a lot of Kramer vs. Kramer, but I think Marriage Story is superior. This film is sure to be honored at most, if not all, of the awards ceremonies. I for one think that it should win Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and at least three of the acting categories (actor, actress, and supporting actress). Obviously, I have not seen all 2019 awards show contenders yet, but I will be very surprised if a film comes out during the remainder of the year that is better."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Heartfelt, incredible movie.

Remembering that Mr.Baumbach\u2019s background as a child of two divorced parents and the ex-husband of Jennifer Jason Leigh, it is easy to understand where his allegiance lies amidst the two parents vying for the affection of their son. As is so often the case where the writer and director are one in the same, this film could easily have used the input of a third party to edit and minimize lengthy scenes and dialogue as well as a choice in casting (since some of the characters appear to be more like stereotypes than real life individuals). One might argue that these lengthy oratorical performances by the characters gives them an opportunity to exhibit their acting wares and, true as that may be, it adds to the length of the film which could be shorter than its 2 and \u00bc hours. All that being said, I give the film a 9.0 because it is a heartfelt and brilliant dissection of the divorce process, those who exploit it and those who are victims of it as written and directed by one of its vital participants."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "LIFF33 2019 #1\u201cI never really came alive for myself; I was only feeding his aliveness.\u201dI\u2019ve said some harsh things about Netflix movies in the past, but recently I\u2019m starting to warm up to them.\u2018Marriage Story\u2019 was absolutely excellent. A devastating portrayal of divorce that can bring out the ugly in people, especially with child custody. But it\u2019s not all doom and gloom. It\u2019s incredibly heartfelt with plenty of humorous moments. I guess you have to find the comedy during the difficulties in life. Lets just say my cheeks wasn\u2019t dry afterwards.And yes, I wept.Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson both gave masterclass performances. And I do mean some power house acting. Driver plays Charlie, a competitive and undaunted theatre director that he is very clear about what he wants. Johansson plays Nicole, a mother who\u2019s a delightful presence and loves to play, but is also a dedicated actor. This is the best I\u2019ve seen from Johnasson. Her character delivers a monougle where she\u2019s explains the issues in her life that\u2019s all shot in one take, which brilliantly displays her acting chops where she naturally shifts from emotion to emotion - it was impeccable.The supporting cast were all fantastic. Lauren Dern, Ray Liotta, Merritt Wever, Julie Hagerty, and Alan Alda were all brilliant and really bounce off the energy from Driver and Johansson. Even the child actor held his own between these juggernauts of actors.Not only are the performances the strongest element of the movie, but so is the writing. Every character is so uniquely fleshed out that the conflict feels so incredibly raw. It\u2019s one of the reasons why I was so glued to the movie from start to finish. One of the best screenplays of the year.This is the first Noah Baumbach movie I\u2019ve seen from him and I am aware of his other work, just haven\u2019t got around to watching them. However, I feel like this was the best introduction to him as a director, because he crafted such a sympathetic look on marriage dissolving away. We don\u2019t see the full relationship, but we do get to hear Nicole and Charlie individually describe what their love about each other, while there\u2019s a montage that flash\u2019s through their routine life together with their son. Nothing visually striking in the presentation, but not once did it feel stale.The score from Randy Newman was terrific and fitted wonderfully with the movie. I loved the aspect ratio as it added a lot to the overall mood of the movie. When the two go head to head in the custody battle - that doesn't mean they\u2019re enemies. They still talk to each other as if they are still a thing. It\u2019s also hard to pick aside, because you understand where each of them are coming from, and even if you do choose, you still feel bad for either one.Overall rating: Any other relationship movie aint sh*t compared to this."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Marriage Story is one of Noah Baumbach's best films, and perhaps one of the best movies of 2019.

Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver give the best performances of their careers, and Adam Driver in particular proves that he is one of the best actors alive today. His portrayal of a father going through the ringer in an attempt to protect his son broke my heart. He goes through every possible emotion flawlessly, and he is so vulnerable you can't help but feel for the guy.The script is a work of art. There are no good guys or bad guys. No one is right or wrong. Everything is a very human shade of grey, and the story just made me think about how I view my own romantic relationships. The score is beautiful, with a very surprisingly well utilized Stephen Sondheim ballad that anyone with any theatre history will recognize immediately.The cinematography is pure kino. The way space and barriers are used is just beautiful. Its very subtle, but its there. Its implemented wonderfully.This is one of the best dramas of 2019. It's definitely get some acting award buzz.

It's also a supremely well-executed artistic experience on a structural, dramatic, thematic, and technical level. It's rare to have a film operate so meticulously in its characterization process, yet remain so fascinating and emotionally impressive. In many other films, you'd label it a potential issue to have your average scene length be somewhere between 7-10 minutes, and to have most of those scenes involve characters simply talking to one another. But these are very carefully constructed moments of build-up, allowing the audience to breathe these characters in and empathize with every action taken and word spoken, no matter how hurtful or diabolical it may seem on the surface. At the end of the proverbial day, we find we're dealing with nuanced human beings trying desperately to navigate their respective ways through a tragic phase of existence (a kind of death, as the movie so aptly puts it).

This profound experience is so rare, that it has happened to me only once. In Marriage Story.Marriage StoryThe writer and director, Noah Baumbach is spewing love. Not the usual way of expressing. But then, miscommunication is a major factor in this film. He is sugar-coating or bitter-coating a love story, by deconstructing, reverse-engineering a love story. Although that is what it seems at first. The film, above all, wonder me the most, is when it balances both sides of the coin. Every now and then, I think about what happened, why we are here, just as those characters do. It all makes sense and nothing fits despite the description, the definition. And still you don't feel cheated. And Noah dodged that bullet so effortlessly that you- at certain points in the film, even when there is no particularly emotional hurdle to cross- melt with a cathartic smile and tears, in its simple wittiness. The film deliberately follows Adam Driver's perspective. Now, that is a perfect choice, considering he \"is walking on\" something that he doesn't fully understand, just like us, the audience. Hence, he comes off warm and even pitiful at times, more than he actually might be or should. For following Scarlett Johanson would have come off calculative rather than spontaneous. Not something that the film wants to put out. It is vulnerable phenomena to be in. And to experience it, you should be out of control. Desperation is what drives the greed. And greed, something you keep it off the table from Day 1, is what it will come to. Not materialistic but philosophical. You'd want to be how you think of yourself to be.

I love everyone involved in the movie so expectations were very high. But immediately, (IMMEDIATELY) the intrusive, BUSY musical score started to drive a nail into my head. Here were two monologues; letters written by the lead characters about each other. They were smart (if a little precious) and heartfelt and full of nice details. However, the entire time Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson were speaking, this wall to wall orchestra kept sawing away, frolicking and gamboling like a Rossini overture underlining the moments with 'whimsy' and the promise of 'heartache.' Like a bright yellow highlight pen, the music left no room for independent thought: I was being told exactly how to feel about every second. But I got through the opening bits; although I didn't quite buy any of the director/actor theatre scenes- Why is that no one ever seems to be able to capture the truth of what it's like to do small theatre? Those ridiculous rehearsal scenes were painful in their ostentatious inauthenticity...and don't get me started on the actual performance of the play. It was almost exactly like that old SNL sketch \"Bad Conceptual Theatre\" - If only Dan Aykroyd had stepped out as Leonard Pinth Garnell to give a review - Even more hilarious was the discovery in a later scene that this awful slice of \"high art\" was slated for Broadway. In what universe? But I stuck with it until the scene where Scarlett Johansson reminds her husband that she finds it difficult to cry onstage only to walk into her bedroom and burst into tears. This is a moment that should've wrecked me. It's beautifully set up, and would have been totally unexpected and rending. But at she walks through the hallway towards her bedroom, the score whips up into a Soap Opera ready string-filled cry of anguish so generic it could have been used for that old Carol Burnett sketch As The Stomach Turns. The camera pulls in to show Scarlett's tear-filled face - but any empathy is immediately sucker-punched to the ground by the hideously OVER THE TOP music.Cut to: this morning as I scanned through the Golden Globe Nominations. Not only is that exercise in bathos and banality actually nominated for Best Original Score... It was written by none other than Randy Newman. Bummer.If I make it through the movie it will be with the sound off and the subtitles on. I like to decide how I feel about things. I don't need to be smothered in kisses to know I am loved.

When she gets an offer to work in LA, it makes their impending separation much more stressful.

One critic declared it is 'easily the most compelling divorce story since Kramer V Kramer.' I suppose it depends on what you consider compelling. There are plenty of other films about divorce but the one that springs to my mind is Todd Haynes' 2015 film, Carol, impeccably cast, acted and shot. Carol received a 10 minute standing ovation at Cannes that year and scored 95 on Metacritic, just one point more than MS (though Carol is a far superior film in every sense). There are a good deal of curtain-chewing and adult tantrums in MS but these don't disguise the fact that there is very little 'story'. MS is well acted but the characters don't really have much to work with. Their marriage has real problems, certainly, but good grief, what marriage doesn't? Basically, they need to talk more; she needs to be more assertive and he needs to listen and make compromises. Instead, they wind up paying absurd amounts of money for something that could easily have been worked out with more mediation. No doubt this happens all the time, but do we really need to witness the histrionics? Put simply, Marriage Story is mush in the same way that the weakest Woody Allen movies are mush. If you engage with that kind of jump-improv, indulgent, pseudo-self-analysis; if you like watching dewey-eyed, beautiful couples who have an almost perfect relationship talk themselves apart (leaving their oddly untraumatised child apparently saner and happier than either of them) then break out the popcorn and paper hankies.

Any film that deals with divorce automatically hits close to my heart, as I come from divorced parents. I'm always interested to see how it will be portrayed differently in each film. And I gotta say, I think the last time I watched a divorce film that was so raw and honest about divorce was 'Blue Valentine' from 10 years ago starring Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams.

You'll laugh, you might cry and you'll definitely feel the heart strings tugged with this one, but the picture assuredly earns the reactions it evokes. Go see it in the theater or catch it on Netflix."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Best film I\u2019ve seen in a while and my favourite from 2019 so far. Way more realistic, captivating, gut-wrenching and well paced than say, The Irishman, for example. That film was a nice piece of rich storytelling, slightly over-indulgent in its duration, but Marriage Story just resonated with me more. To be honest, I don\u2019t think 2019 has been a great year for film. Preferred last year\u2019s releases (Roma, The Favourite, A Star Is Born, Green Book, etc) I\u2019m hoping on this Marriage Story winning big at the Oscars. It\u2019s superbly acted, that conflict scene at around 1:30hr in to the film was top class. Excellent writing, directing, and yes, the ending was a beautiful end to the journey witnessed onscreen. I don\u2019t get how anyone couldn\u2019t like it, but then again, I found the ending to The Sopranos and Breaking Bad great. Both are polarising endings."}], "recommendations": ["blue_valentine", "manchester_by_the_sea", "the_descendants", "collateral_beauty", "joy", "revolutionary_road", "blue_jasmine", "fences", "gifted", "scent_of_a_woman", "closer", "the_father", "me_before_you", "the_intern", "the_place_beyond_the_pines", "the_danish_girl", "the_fault_in_our_stars", "silver_linings_playbook", "leaving_las_vegas", "the_glass_castle", "21_grams", "rain_man", "call_me_by_your_name", "lady_bird", "lovelace"]}
