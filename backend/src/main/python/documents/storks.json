Yet another hugely entertaining animation from Warner Bros., Storks is one of the most insane yet absolutely delightful films you\u2019ll see all year. Mixing rapid-fire and random humour with a heartfelt and warm story about family, there was barely a moment where I wasn\u2019t grinning ear-to-ear in this film, making it one of the happiest, funniest and most enjoyable animations I\u2019ve seen in quite a while.Over the course of this film, the level of comedy changes quite significantly, but I want to start off by talking about the first two-thirds. Simply put, the humour during this part of the movie is utterly insane. Not only incredibly rapid and frantic, the sheer randomness of everything that happens on screen is at times bewildering to see, from a nerdy chicken with a jet pack to a pack of wolves turning into a submarine, there are literally no bounds to what this film will come up with, but that makes for massive laughs time and time again.What\u2019s brilliant is that this film knows how silly it wants to be, and that gives it a real confidence in the delivery of the insane brand of humour. It might not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but I guarantee that so many kids will love every second of it, and even adults can have a huge amount of fun too if they approach with the right attitude. Don\u2019t expect this to be a Pixar classic, because that\u2019s not what it\u2019s trying to be. If you\u2019re prepared to sit back and be hit with a barrage of utterly hilarious madness, then this film will be a massively entertaining watch.That brand of ridiculous comedy is by far the film\u2019s best feature, and it keeps it consistently entertaining and funny for the best part of an hour. There is a brief moment where it feels a little exhaustive, but that\u2019s fortunately when everything takes a different direction.Still retaining good humour, the final third of Storks is actually quite an emotional one. It\u2019s not necessarily a tearjerker, however the final act\u2019s heavy emphasis on family values and unity is exceptionally heartwarming to watch, and added an impressive level of depth to the characters and story as the film comes to a close, making it an even more wonderful watch beyond the hilarious comedy.Finally, I want to quickly talk about the performances. Andy Samberg and Katie Crown are simply fantastic in the central roles, with excellent chemistry throughout, and fantastic comedic prowess at every moment. Along with the leads, the likes of Kelsey Grammer and Stephen Kramer Glickman provide some hugely entertaining voice performances for supporting characters, giving the film even more vibrancy and energy wherever you look.Overall, I thought Storks was an absolutely brilliant film. Principally a hilarious and utterly insane family comedy, featuring bewildering humour, crazy animation and hilarious voice performances, it adds another level of delight in its final act with a heartfelt and happy climax."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "To realise their actual line of work.I usually anticipate the animation films, but I was not interested in this. I saw it mainly because of how much I liked 'The Lego Movie'. This is not as good as that one, but cute little adorable animation. The film is exclusively for the kids and the families, but anybody can have a good time if they are not expecting according to their age, gender and other things. So if you are yet to watch, leave behind those in order to enjoy it.It is nothing to do with the 2009 short film 'Partly Cloudy'. But those who wanted a feature film on the similar theme would enjoy it. It is a little different though. The storks who switched their business to another, 18 years later a chain of events makes them realise what they should be doing. So in an adventure, soon to be the boss, a bird named Junior struggles to fix his mistake. In the process, he unleashes some secrets which brings the final act where the narration decides which way to end.Not a bad story, which is a road adventure like many animation films. The comedies were good and the characters are well developed in the short span. Some parts seem very silly, but enjoyable. Particularly the wolf-pack and their weird approach to deal with things. The animation too was very smooth and overall film was short, so swiftly narrated tale. This is not the year's best animation, though watching it for entertainment would work. Animation fans should not miss it, and must see for little children.7/10"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Storks is an animated film that works because of its fast paced scenes and dialogue. Nicholas Stoller has a lot to do with this film's success. He doesn't let the film become to drawen out and lagging in scenes by just keeping it moving. It's not perfect some bits don't work, but overall this is just a good time. Plus those babies are adorable.

And I was not disappointed when it came to her. But almost everything else in Storks just doesn't entertain a late teenager like me.(I did \"like\" pets and zootopia. maybe not as much as hideo kojima) The kids should like it though. But don't expect them to be laughing all the time.\rNow to see DeepWater Horizon(Hopefully \"based on a true story\" can bring life to the excessive explosions)"}, {"rating": "6", "text": "I was actually kind of into this movie for a large part of it.  It\u2019s not a very good movie by any stretch of the imagination, I daresay it\u2019s more of a mediocre film than anything else, but I think that\u2019s because I was expecting too much of it since it\u2019s from the same studio that gave us the Lego movie.  That being said, however, there\u2019s genuine times that made me really, really laugh and if you have kids, I definitely recommend you take them to this one over Trolls any day of the week, seriously, this was alright, the only thing that is really vulnerable is that they don\u2019t really do much role building and the story has a lot of narrative issues, but you get extra points for casting Kelsey Grammer, that man is hilarious."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Storks is... ok. I liked the mostly original concept and the fact that the story was nicely offbeat, making a lot of unexpected twists and turns which meant that the story wasn't as predictable as some other animated films. Storks is cute and the third act was nicely emotional. However, I didn't like the improv-style comedy, the pacing was punishingly fast, the characters weren't interesting, and the animation was mediocre. This is especially considering that the studio that did the animation (SPI) also did the animation for The Angry Birds Movie. Overall, it's a safe film that kids will definitely like. Adults... not so much."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "My husband and I fell unexpectedly in love with this movie. We went to see it in theaters based on the humor evident in the trailer and were shocked by how much we enjoyed it not only for its humor but also its heart. The story goes surprisingly poignant places to do with parenting, family planning, and general themes about family relationships. The character design is extremely appealing, the animation is rock solid, and the lighting and materials are surprisingly lovely. I also really enjoyed the musical soundtrack. The score is unobtrusively supportive of the action and the pop songs for several scenes were very well chosen to contribute to the mood of the story points. Pigeon toady and the other characters' reactions to him are so darn funny. We keep quoting the lines to each other. If you are in the habit of assuming that films you didn't hear much about when they came out just aren't good, think again. This is an incredibly charming and enjoyable movie, and I recommend it to everyone who loves animated family films."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Storks soars in terms of animation and sentimental value, but it's humor feels like something that has already been laughed at countless times before."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I can't wait to see the movie Storks.

The story itself is pretty bland, extremely predictable and feels like it was put together within minutes without much thought.

Como se ve, las cig\u00fce\u00f1as ya no entregan bebes por ser \"peligroso\" y ahora entregan paquetes. Una cig\u00fce\u00f1a llamada Junior se ve obligado por su jefe a despedir una hu\u00e9rfana pero a la vez la \u00fanica humana de la monta\u00f1a cig\u00fce\u00f1a, llamada Tulip, a cambio de ser el nuevo jefe de la monta\u00f1a, pero accidentalmente Tulip enciende la antigua m\u00e1quina de bebes, y hacen una bebe, que Junior y Tulip de eran juntos devolver ese bebe.\rBueno, la historia es un poco simple, pero eso NO arruina la pel\u00edcula, en cambio es entretenida.\r La pel\u00edcula empieza de una manera medio extra\u00f1a, porque los personajes ya hacen todo su papel r\u00e1pido, como en la escena de Tulip queriendo volar con otros tipos de aves que no saben volar, y terminan casi incendiando la f\u00e1brica. Pero despu\u00e9s de todo, la pel\u00edcula se desarrolla de una manera normal, pues un ni\u00f1o, que pidi\u00f3 un bebe sin saber que las cig\u00fce\u00f1as ya no entregan bebes. A\u00fan as\u00ed Tulip y Junior tienen que entregarlo, pase lo que pase.\r La comedia de la pel\u00edcula es algo rara. Digo, los lobos se convierten en una escalera, un bote, un submarino, en un avi\u00f3n (que por cierto fracasaron en el intrnto) y luego se convirtieron en una camioneta. Cuando en realidad, son demasiados lobos para que se convierte en dichas cosas, pero al menos da risa, hasta mi pap\u00e1 se ri\u00f3 y yo tambi\u00e9n... Tambi\u00e9n vi esta pel\u00edcula doblada al espa\u00f1ol, y las voces estaban bastante bien, tenian puros modismos mexicanos, y les quedaban bastante bien a los personajes.\r La animaci\u00f3n es una de las cosas que m\u00e1s me interesa de una pel\u00edcula, y aqu\u00ed si supieron aprovechar la animaci\u00f3n, en donde se puede ver una gran calidad de animaci\u00f3n, los paisajes o escenarios se ven algo \"realistas\" y se ven bastante hermosos, bien dise\u00f1ados y bien detallados, hay lugares que no se ven feos, el dise\u00f1o de los personajes tambi\u00e9n me parece muy bueno, aunque, el dise\u00f1o de los humanos algunos se llegan a ver medio cabezones, y bastante delgados, pero eso no es tan malo la verdad. Tambi\u00e9n los bebes tienen un dise\u00f1o algo decente, pues estos si se ven un poco cabezones, y los momentos donde aparecen, me parece algo \"que me saca de onda\".\r Tambi\u00e9n me gusto la personalidad de los personajes, son muy carism\u00e1ticos. Exepto el puto jefe de la monta\u00f1a cig\u00fce\u00f1a es bastante plano y algo aburrido. Tambi\u00e9n el sentimiento de los personajes es bueno, no se ustedes, pero yo me puse muy pensativo con ver el final al ver a Tulip y su familia de nuevo. XD\rAveces me pasa con alg\u00fan momento similar en esas pel\u00edculas animadas..\r Debo decir que, cig\u00fce\u00f1as es una gran pelicula, no es la mejor, no es perfecta, pero para m\u00ed, es una buena pel\u00edcula que uno deber\u00eda ver este fin de semana..

Initially flying under my radar, I was expecting a generic animated flick of subpar quality that would really only appeal to young kids while boring and possible even annoying their parents. Imagine my surprise to find out that it's actually one of the funnier and sweeter movies this side of Pixar and DreamWorks.Basically this is a story about family. Morals of opening yourself to others and finding your family are on full display. It's even got a message for adults about spending time with your kids before it's too late. There are plenty of sweet and heartwarming moments. Maybe a few tearjerkers for the more emotional out there(nothing wrong with that). Then there are those cute babies.Storks is also flat out hilarious. There's a manic sense of energy to things that leads to the firing a constant stream of diverse jokes. With some range and energy it's almost unbelievable how well these jokes hit their mark. There's almost never a miss. The pace and almost insane nature of the humor may be off putting for some, but those who like their comedy fast, effective, and to the point are sure to be entertained.Storks is an all around success that probably hasn't gotten the attention it deserves. It's crazy nature, original concept, and wealth of heart make it an excellent choice for families.

There are a few troubles that I find with this movie that kills anything that could have made it great, firstly the plot can easiest be considered really fractured and broken since little to none of the things are explained properly for example they mention that the storks delivered used to deliver babies but decided to stop becuase one of the storks tried to kidnap tulip (the female protagonist)but it laters turns out that the stork has been looking for the pieces of the tracking device they used to deliver her but nothing explains the middle point other that whole his life he just wanted to deliver his baby (which earlier was told that he wanted her for himself). Secondly and most annoying is THERE IS ALMOST NO SILENCE, every single moment they talk and there is no silence what so ever except for the fighting scene with the penguins which should be the one part where there actually should be sound seriously this is one of the thing they should have considered. lastly is that none of the jokes in the movie was funny and they are getting totaly destroy with the character explaining every single joke to the audience and I know that the movie is aimed at kids but even kids would be able to understand most of the jokes without anyone having to explain it to them, it's just insulting to the kids watching it."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah why did 1 watch this**** dreamworks or whoever made this ****"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "funny and amazing animation..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Good visually but full of extremely annoying characters and writing.

Hunter assigns the task of firing her to Junior (Samberg) and if he succeeds, he will be promoted to boss. He is unable to do so and assigns her to the mail room instead.Elsewhere, a lonely young boy named Nate Gardner sends a letter to Cornerstone requesting for a younger brother. Tulip receives the letter and mistakenly creates a baby girl using the baby-making machine. Junior finds out about this but fearing that he will be fired, he has no other choice but to go on an adventure trip with Tulip to deliver the baby to Nate before Hunter finds out.For the second movie of Warner Animation Group after 2014\u2019s The Lego Movie, this is a fun and entertaining movie but not enough entertainment values to match up to The Lego Movie. Still, I am not saying it is a bad movie. For the cast performance, the voice acting is good which is not a problem and not really much of a flaw in that part. The movie\u2019s animation is really done well just like The Lego Movie which I really like it.However, the plot of the movie is not a very strong suit and it gets a little boring and become uninteresting in the middle of the movie.
