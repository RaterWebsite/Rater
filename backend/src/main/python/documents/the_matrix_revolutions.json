This kind of big-budget risk-taking is what classics are all about. Like 'Blade Runner' and '2001: A Space Odyssey' before it, 'The Matrix Revolutions' manages to say the things that are so difficult to say. Yes, there is action. Yes, there is spectacle.

The Battles are visually very rich and the VFX still hold up very well for an almost 10 year old film. The Messiah story is filled with philosofical content with which you might not always agree but it does provide food for thought and the films tend to stick in your mind much more than the modern day action fodder tends to do. This makes seeing these gems on Blu-ray again as much a joy as they first times I saw them at the cinemas!"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Alright, after being left with mixed feelings about the second movie I was hoping to have the question of how Neo managed to stop the machines answered adequately in this movie, but it was not. Also, this movie adds even more questions along the same lines: how does Neo manage to see in the real after he is physically blinded? (BTW: The same thing happened in the Dune saga which is probably not just coincidence, there's some deep philosophical meaning to these in both I'm just not entirely sure what it is). How does Neo absorb the sentinel into himself in the end? Three possible theories I have are: 1) Zion and the outside world are just another layer of reality inside the matrix created to fool the people who escape the inner layer of the Matrix that they are free. 2) Neo is actually a machine himself (or possibly the cookie the oracle gave him lets him carry a machine program somehow, after all in computer lingo a \"cookie\" is a small piece of data you give to a user visiting your website so you can track them), 3) Neo has achieved enlightenment inside the matrix but a side-effect is that he's also achieved enlightenment in the real world, in Buddhism for example it is said there are high-level monks that can bend reality melting snow with their minds and/or make thing materialize out of thin air, etc.. It's possibly Neo's enlightenment lets him do something similar in the real world. Any of these explanations work but we never really know what the creators of these movies really intended since they have stated they would rather let us figure out things for ourselves. The other confusing part of the movie is the manner in which Neo defeats Smith when he realizes he has to stop fighting Smith and just give in to win. I think it has something to do with him realizing he is only fighting himself or duality is an illusion, since a lot of spiritual paths say this. But once again we'll never really know. After watching the trilogy once or twice I suggest you view the versions where they have the audio by two philosophers watching the film over the film, you will understand the film a lot better after seeing that. Overall I love the trilogy. The one thing about this last movie is the beginning is really lame. The first and second movies had epic scenes to start them off, this one just starts up with the characters on the hover-ship having a conversation with each other, how lame is that? I docked a point from this final one for that. They should have started with the scene in \"Mobil Ave\" (ie: Limbo) that would have been more exciting to start with. But other than that a great movie, albeit still confusing the first time you see it."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Like the second one, this was good as the first one.

Good conclusion the series."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "This movie has his strong scenes with wow effect. Consider the visual effects and the epic story that comes to an end. But it has also some weaknesses: some characters are very boring and I had the feeling some actors and characters came into the movie, because the makers are so political correct. Also some fights are too long."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Although the film can get quite spotty and in many ways....droll, the action scenes coupled with the still top rate acting of it's major characters propels this movie to a solid an average 7. This movie could have been so much more than an action film in so many ways and at least a solid 20 minutes could have been trimmed from this film alone. The B-rate extras fudging up some of the easiest lines in Hollywood history. The Matrix Revolutions answers many questions in this final installment in better ways than many other sci-fi films  Terminator 3), but it fails to grip you the way the philosophy of the first Matrix did."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Much of the philosophical ambiguity of the first two is absent in this film, and a number of the characters needed more development.  The dialog is even more wooden than in the first two, also.  However, the action and soundtrack are both superb.  However, much like the second installment, the action scenes have a habit of overstaying their welcome.  The third act is what saved this movie though, with a LEGENDARY final fight sequence, and some good screen time with Neo and Trinity leading up to it.  In the end, The Matrix Revolutions is a mostly unworthy but still enjoyable concluding chapter to an exceptional trilogy."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "The conclusion of the Matrix trilogy. It is excellent and also a bit of a disappointment for me at the same time. Lets start with the good things: The characters, style, special effects, fights, action scenes, set up and story (mostly) are really good. I enjoyed the movie a lot because of this. On the other hand the conclusion is a bit unsatisfying, the climax of the movie battle is also a bit underwhelming (expected more with this build up), parts of the story are weaker and some questions are not answered or better said there are teaser that there was more than meets the eye. I read that the Wachowski brothers (now sisters) had not developed much for a sequel when the first movie became far more successful and influential as they expected. This put them under pressure when a sequel must be made to use the tide of the success. So I will say they had to make some sacrifices here but it is not garbage by any reasonable standard. The story continues after the cliffhanger ending of Matrix Reloaded. The machines have found the location of the underground city of humanity and started their attack. The human resistance has neither the resources or manpower to win an open war. Sidenote: I say this is beyond stupidity to have no back up. Meanwhile Agent Smith is turning the Matrix upside down with his new powers while Neo is unconscious and maybe even in a comatose state. As set up this is amazing. The situation is at an all-time low and the next hours will be the make or break point for everyone. I truly enjoyed the set up and the heroes journey against the overwhelming odds. Some parts are weaker like for example parts of the conclusion, some side story arcs and the climax. Visuals and special effects are awesome. Again they create something that feels disturbingly realistic and believable. The action and fight scenes are well done and do not disappoint. I dislike the final confrontation a bit as it feels a bit short and underwhelming but I will admit it is still awesome too. The actors deliver again a good performance. Keanu Reeves as Neo is fully convincing and I praise his role. Sadly Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus is barely in the movie. It is just slightly more than blink and you miss him ;-). Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith is the hidden star again. He is such an enjoyable antagonist and now he is overwhelming like an unstoppable force of nature. Carrie Ann Moss can shine a bit more with showing a bit of more facets of Trinity\u2019s character. For the side characters I will praise Jada Pinkett Smith as Niobe, Mary Alice as the oracle and Ian Bliss as Bane (I could Morpheus put also in the side character list for this movie but refused). Overall this movie hits more than it misses. It is good enough to be a satisfying conclusion but not awesome enough to get a higher rating. I say most people agree for this as mostly the first Matrix movie is brought up in movie conversations and the sequels are always seen as inferior. I would still recommend the whole trilogy but say it is not on the level of the best movie trilogies like for example the original Star Wars movies, Back to the Future or Indiana Jones. Bonus thought with a !!!Spoiler Warning!!!: After watching it I say Neo was never the chosen one. He was just the catalyst for agent Smith who is the true chosen one. This is not a joke. Think about it: Firstly: He fits all descriptions of the prophecy. Secondly: Without the thread of Agent Smith what could Neo hope to get done except slowing down the inevitable (Nothing to bargain with the machines)? Thirdly: It is already told by the creator that Neo is not that unique or the chosen one and a conversation near the end says all this was a dangerous gamble. Alternative: I could also argue that both Neo and Agent Smith are the chosen one as both were needed and one without the other could not start the chain of events that result in the outcome. This would be the two sides of a coin argument."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Absolutely amazing trilogy, love it. Highly recommended movie.

(Before I do anything else with this review, I have to say the user who complained about the contradiction between the original and the sequels is wrong: the Machines were manipulating the One so that he had to reboot the system periodically to keep it running.) This movie does have its moments--Sati is cute, in particular, and the assault on Zion shows remarkably subdued mindless action--but they're counterbalanced by the mediocre and outright bad. As an example, the scene near the end where Trinity flies above the clouds and sees the sun is simply beautiful--or it would be if the craft hadn't lost power as a consequence and crashed. Not only was it sad for me to see Trinity, my personal favourite character, die, it also struck me as unnecessarily cruel and a devaluation of her character. What happened to how capable she was in the first two films? Also, the final battle between Neo and Smith did take a bit too long to end.

Everything was set up perfectly leading into a potentially exciting conclusion, and most of the film went as expected. There was terrific action and science fiction drama, some amazing special effects, and the legend of Neo continued to grow, right up until the conclusion. The end of the film went from extremely predictable to ridiculously strange and confusing. While I'm sure the ending made perfect sense to the Wachowski's, it made no sense to me, an avid science fiction fan and movie critic. This being a review, means I can't go into specifics, but the ending was absolutely horrible and puts the whole series in a different light. The most disheartening part of this whole thing is that until that point, the Matrix has been done to near perfection. The story was solid, the action was out of this world, the special effects were amazing, the casting was flawless, and just when the trilogy should have reached it's apex, it all comes crashing down. Once again the cast is terrific and the story is great, which is why I don't understand how they could give us an ending like that. I thoroughly enjoyed the Matrix trilogy and it will certainly hold it's place in cinematic history, but as a fan I was horribly disappointed by an ending that came out of nowhere and left the audience scratching it's head."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "An improvement on Reloaded at the very least, but it just carries on far too long and has a rather pathetic ending.

The lavish and complex Zion dock fight, where a small group of human-controlled heavily armed mech suits desperately attempt to defend the last human city from a seemingly endless horde of merciless \"squiddy\" machine sentinels. That's really about it. The beginning of the film is OK, but the vast majority of it is so annoyingly mediocre, and some moments are so embarrassingly awful that Revolutions makes for a disappointing final chapter in the Wachowski's sci-fi blockbuster trilogy. All the cast's performances underwhelm, apart from Hugo Weaving whose performance as the increasingly power-mad Agent Smith becomes so gloriously camp and over-the-top that it's kind of funny to watch. He also has the only memorable line in the film - once Neo (Keanu Reeves) returns to an apocalyptic, stormy Matrix for his final showdown with his adversary, Smith asks him sardonically \"Like what I've done with the place?\". This final battle is, disappointingly a bit silly and repetitive, resembling a knockoff fight from Dragonball Z rather than the epic clash of titans the series has been building towards. About the only thing this final, underwhelming set-piece offers apart from intense tedium is some pretty slow-motion water effects. None of the film's characters really develop any further in this film, and most of the cast have very little to do apart from Reeves, who is basically playing Jesus in a big flappy coat. And don't even get me started on the clunky bit of exposition the Wachowskis crowbar in to explain why The Oracle is now played by someone else (Gloria Foster died between the second and third films).
