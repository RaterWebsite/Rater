For those reasons, I hadn't seen it since I was a kid. Watching it again years later, not only did I realize just how good a movie it is, but I also found that I took a lot more out of it. While being widely considered as one of the best mafia movies of all time, A Bronx Tale actually has a deeper meaning, which is not to waste the talent you have in the time you are given. I was also surprised to learn that this story is in fact the true story of Chazz Palminteri's childhood, with Chazz being a nickname for Calogero. For those of you who don't know the story, it's about the son of a bus driver, who grows up in the Bronx, right down the block from a mafia hangout. While this boy learns different things from his real family and his mafia family, who are always at odds, they actually both want the same things for this kid. A Bronx Tale isn't just another gangster movie, there is some of that, but it's really an inspirational coming of age tale that I found to be very eye opening. The cast is of course fantastic, featuring Robert De Niro, who directs and stars in the film, along with Palminteri, who wrote the film. The true irony of A Bronx Tale is surrounded by the true story of Lillo Brancato, the boy who plays Calogero. As I said the story is about discovering right from wrong and not wasting your talent, something Brancato did when he was convicted of an armed robbery, which led to the death of an off-duty police officer. There are many sides to that, but I felt it necessary to mention how ironic it is that the message of the film is actually lost on one it's stars. In closing, A Bronx Tale really is a lost gem, that lives up to all the hype, and I hope that now that's streaming on Netflix, a whole new generation will be exposed to the message it puts out there for them to hear."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "A Bronx Tale successfully brings out every emotion your system can handle. From anger, to joy, to laughter, to happiness, to sympathy, to empathy, to tears, and to, finally, satisfaction as the final scene fades into credits. This is De Niro's directorial debut and he handles the challenge exquisitely. Complimented by Chazz Palminteri's slick and fearless writing that documents the struggles, the gangs, and the racism of the Bronx streets with no sugarcoating and no easy ways out.\r Adapted from its stage play counterpart, A Bronx Tale focuses on the famous area in New York where little nine year old Calogero (played by Francis Capra during his tender years) is growing up on the unapologetic streets with his bus driver father Lorenzo (De Niro) and his nervous mother. Lorenzo frequently warns Calogero that \"the saddest thing in life is a wasted talent,\" hoping that his son will take the path of untold success later in life.\r One day, while sitting idly on his stoop with his buddies, Calogero witnesses a murder. The murder was made by the area mafia boss Sonny (Palminteri). Him and his crew are respected, at the same time feared for their unpredictable actions and their checkered history. When called back to the scene by detectives looking for the murderer, young Calogero lies and refuses to confess. His father is subtly proud, but warns his son that he has just done a good thing for a bad person. The good news is their family won't be on the hit list. The bad news is their family is now on the suspicious list.\r Eight years later, Calogero, now played by Lillo Brancato Jr., is nicknamed \"C\" by Sonny and has become his main-man. His second son as well as his partner in crime. His father is somewhat oblivious to what his son has been up to recently, but he believes he can take care of himself, while still nudging him in the right direction.\r Sonny's philosophy is greatly different from Lorenzo's. It's \"nobody really cares.\" When the chips are down, who's there to care? Nobody. You're a worthless human. The brutally honest, shameless half of the glass. Sonny's philosophy sticks with Calogero, but he also keeps his father's in mind. Do the two connect? Maybe in some ambiguous, unorthodox way, but it just seems they are two contradicting ways of life. Here's a film that also shows us that if we're lucky, we get two different outlooks on life from two very different people. A man who works in a town and a man who owns it.\r De Niro was in a very rough position when it came time to grab a hold of the camera for this film. He could either take the easy way out and make a Goodfellas-style mobster flick or mimic his stellar character's lifestyle in Raging Bull. But he doesn't. He most likely was the go-to guy for help with the script and offered Palminteri advice, but in no way is this another mafia film. It's a unique kind of mafia film. It shows the long-lasting and life changing effects it has on a youth growing up on the wrong side of the streets.\r This greatly reminds me of a phenomenal film from the eighties that tackles the same sort of subject. The film was John Singleton's Boyz N The Hood, setting its sights on three troubled youths growing up in the hood and getting caught in the mix of crime, drugs, and racism. The film was Singleton's directorial debut as well, featured stellar performances from every actor in it, a genius script, and some fantastic honesty about the life of the hood. A Bronx Tale does the same, but centers its story around the mafia. Not glorifying the violence, not acting pretentious over other classics of the same genre, but taking a cliche and turning it into a gritty reality.\r What is important to learn from A Bronx Tale is that it's a movie with values. It believes that beliefs and values should be the first thing someone should consider when in a serious situation. Sometimes we don't think about the consequences and dive right into what we think will satisfy ourselves and turn out the way we want in no time. It too forms the question; is it better to be universally loved or feared? I'd rather be a little bit of both with a strong blend of respect.\r Starring: Lillo Brancato, Jr., Chazz Palminteri, Robert De Niro, Taral Hicks, Francis Capra, Kathrine Narducci, Clem Caserta, and Joe Pesci.

A wonderful story on a boy and his Bronx neighborhood and all the colorful characters , both good and bad. This kid is eye view of the criminals and the lure of easy money and power is alluring and seductive. The cast is wonderful and colorful, ala Godfather, shot beautifully and with humor and a peek into innocence and a world of reality of a neighborhoods dirty secret.

C's apartment is just a couple of doors down from the bar where Mafia 'boss' Sonny (Palmintero) runs all of his illicit dealings in the neighbourhood.Young C is drawn into the lifestyle, against Lorenzo's wishes, and has to balance his personal life and his desire to become what both his father and Sonny want him to be.It's a by the numbers story, but it plays out incredibly well. All the actors know where their boundaries are, but go to town within them.Add in a fantastic contemporary soundtrack and well thought out cinematography and the illusion of the late 60s is put up well on screen.The film is let down though by a lot of heavy-handed moralising. It does feel out of place having both of the male adults in C's life spending so much time spelling out the ideals he should be living by.Overall, it's a great film, but falls short of both perfection and brilliance!"}, {"rating": "0", "text": "C'est tir\u00e9 d'une pi\u00e8ce de th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'acteur principal Palminteri et r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par De Niro, pas tr\u00e8s \u00e7\u00e0 l'aise dans cet exercice p\u00e9rilleux et casse-gueule dont il ne sort certainement pas avec les honneurs...

De Niro wisely stays away from the main acting spotlight and lets the other actors, such as Chazz Palminteri and Lillo Brancato Jr./Francis Capra, shine bright as their colourful and likeable characters. In fact, the whole film is populated by colourful characters who have memorable things to say. They all live in a well-established depiction of The Bronx that is complete with a well-executed soundtrack. Lastly, they all play a part in telling a story that proudly walks the fine line between Comedy and Drama. Before seeing this picture, I was afraid that it was going to be De Niro taking a stab at being a poor man's Martin Scorsese, but instead he has created a film that stands on its own two feet because it is marked by a unique identity that makes it stand out from countless other films that involve gangs/mafias."}], "recommendations": ["donnie_brasco", "only_the_brave", "fighting_with_my_family", "hidden_figures", "the_glass_castle", "goodbye_christopher_robin", "the_founder", "joy", "race", "42", "boyz_n_the_hood", "legends_of_the_fall", "gold", "just_mercy", "the_boy_who_harnessed_the_wind", "spotlight", "the_white_tiger", "white_boy_rick", "captain_fantastic", "the_longest_ride", "gifted", "dead_poets_society", "me_before_you", "charm_city_kings", "gangs_of_new_york"]}
