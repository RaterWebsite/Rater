Flint accepts the invitation from his idol Chester V to join The Live Corp Company, which has been tasked to clean the island, and where the best inventors in the world create technologies for the betterment of mankind. When Flint discovers that his machine still operates and now creates mutant food beasts like living pickles, hungry tacodiles, shrimpanzees and apple pie-thons, he and his friends must return to save the world.",

The foodimals will keep members of the film\u2019s kid-friendly demographic entertained and tongue-in-cheek social satire provide some decent chuckles for parents (as well as older fans of the prior installment). In general, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 doesn\u2019t taste quite as fresh as the original recipe but the film offers more than just re-heated leftovers  with another funny and entertaining adventure that justifies a second helping of Flint Lockwood and friends."

      "text": "Being a fan of the first Cloudy, I was excited to check out the sequel.  While the original is better, mostly because it has more heart, there's lots to keep adults and kids entertained here.  It starts off a bit slow, giving a short review of what happened in the first film for those who didn't watch it (which was definitely thoughtful), but once the story unfolds it pulls the viewer in. It's not a spectacular story; the twists are pretty predictable, but it has a good flow and there are no dull moments. Sony did a fantastic job with the visuals  very colorful, vibrant, and the living food really come to life.  Humor was in good supply, and the food-related puns were actually quite clever.  My only real problems with the movie were the somewhat lacking story line and the protagonist Flint, who didn't seem nearly as endearing as I remember him from the first movie.  They made him too wacky and all over the place, and it's hard to imagine kids relating to him or remembering him as a character they'd like to emulate.  Still, Cloudy 2 will keep you entertained enough, and it's worth watching it at least once, especially if you craved more after watching the original."

The animation looks fantastic, the food animals are creative and amusing, the voice acting is great and, like the first one, it's just hysterical.  While I didn't think it was as gut-busting as the first one, I still laughed a lot and I really want to add this to my \"repeat viewing\" list (come on, Blu-Ray release date...hurry up and get here!).  However, the one thing that I loved the most had to have been the background designs.  The way they created the landscapes into food-based locations was very creative and pretty cool to witness.  Overall, it's a decent and fun follow-up to a epic first film!"

The story went smooth through the first half of the film, but then it kind of just went down hill, from there. The first Cloudy, was funny, and  had a lot of creative  ideas pitch in there, however I felt like the squeal was to predicable, and the scenes just went too fast. I felt like they could've done better, with the music, and whatnot, but the kids well absolutely enjoy it. I'm ranking this a 6.9, or a D+"

But as a followup to the first CWACOM, the sequel fails at every turn.\r The story all but ignores what Flint learned previously and makes him learn it again, but with less clarity and focus. The only saving grace is that Flint and his friends were so well designed and characterized in the first film that some amount of charm has carried over. But considering these are some of the funniest and brightest animated characters of the last several years, they really missed the mark with each one of them. Additionally, the new characters stick out like sore thumbs because they were created with less care and attention that Phil Lord & Chris Miller gave their characters in the beginning.\r Watch the sequel and then immediately put on the original... The former might not hold up as well anymore as you start to see just how much better the original was at telling a story and making you laugh."

All of the story lines had been resolved and the world was safe again from food. Little did we know that Jurassic Park had been resurrected. Actually one of the best scenes recreates the first time in that original movie that we see the reanimated dinosaurs. Only this time they are animated and made of food. What a total ripoff! That is another movie series that should never have gone on. Of course in Hollywood if something works, then you need to keep doing it until you get it wrong. Flints relationships with his not really girlfriend deteriorates to the point of co-worker and the father son turns more into man and his dog. There are some fabulous scenes and humor as well but not enough meat on the bone even for our seven year old. After 20 minutes the kids were bored and the adults just wished it wouldn't degrade into potty humor. It did and that was unfortunately the only real laughs the rest of the way. The morals and lessons weren't too bad except they were just rehashed from the first movie and rather than expanded more like contracted. The funny food animals and especially their combined names were a bright spot in an overwhelmingly dull afternoon. Please do not make a number 3. We all know what happens to leftovers the second reheating."

The plot line was beyond ridiculous and much of the older audience with become fed up and bored with it's fast paced nature. No connection to the characters was present, and the animation was only mediocre. All of these aspects were obviously secondary on the directors priority list."

Personally I liked that the movie had a nice \"lesson\" in it too, it's brief and clear, it doesn't come off as preachy at any point.The movie also doesn't have all those forced long emotional scenes every movie for kids has been forcing in since Toy Story (which actually did it well), the emotional moments are short, sweet and genuine.If you're an adult watching this movie for yourself you'll be wrong to expect this one to be as good as the first, it's definitely not a bad movie, but I didn't feel as engaged with it as I did with the first one. Many of the original's characters return and some of them have sub-plots that get resolved in just one scene and no arc, they feel like they're just along for the ride because they were there in the first one. It isn't quite as good as the first, but it's definitely one of the good ones for kids."

      "text": "Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 is one of those cashgrab sequels in that it was only made to make money and cash in the success of the first one and it clearly shows. The story is nothing special it is generic, clich\u00e9, rehashes the first one and rips off the plots of other animated films, and honestly feels like it was written in one draft made in one hour. I don\u2019t care for the characters and any attempts at humor mostly fall flat. Even the animation isn\u2019t that great, for reasons I cannot put my finger on the animation is painful to look at and some of the character models are painful to look at. That being said I can\u2019t entirely bash this film as it is geared towards kid and as far as kids movies go its not awful I have seen far worse. There are films such as Planes were it was painful all the way through and I just wanted to stop watching. Then there are movies like The Wild were they makers were like **** it and then there is Foodfight, which makes me ask why. This movie will most certainly provide some joy for the kiddies but unfortunately that\u2019s about it. Everyone else don\u2019t feel obligated to watch this movie. Skip it and watch something better. There isn\u2019t enough good in this movie to make it worth watching."

So if you are looking for a something to watch on family movie night this is a good pick.

      "text": "The original film was a humorous and original masterpiece. This film on the other hand falls short in that regard.\rWhile there is still an indisputably long list of jokes, the humour for the sequel is more childish and weak, with the exception of some classic puns. However, on a pun note, a large majority of the film\u2019s dialogue is solely puns, with some even being repeated, not allowing any powerful story-line or morals to develop, resulting in this \u2013 a predictable (and frankly, dry) plotline from which you can know the outcome of the film within the first 20 minutes, such as with blatant foreshadowing and the villain; as soon as you see this certain character, you know he will be the villain without a doubt of hesitation, making the character very bland and uninteresting. Additionally, the story is very confusing at times, as quite often the scenes are very fast-paced with events happening too quickly for the audience to understand. It almost seemed the creators were really trying to squeeze as much in as they could, but quality is always better than quantity.\rOn positive notes, the animation was certainly fluid \u2013 with one character\u2019s animation being truly original with quirky elements that were very humorous and imaginative. The creativity of some \u2018foodimals\u2019 was remarkable, and the world itself was truly colourful. Seeing some of the returning characters was also very joyful, but I will note that some obvious cameos seemed very forced.\rIn terms of the original, this film also seemed to disregard its own lore created in the original, going against a lot of the reasoning to the first film\u2019s story and creating an entirely new reasoning, such as: why Flint wanted to become an inventor.\rConcluding, it is an enjoyable film targeted for kids, but if you were hoping for the same originality as the first film, you might want to stick with the first meal and not go back for seconds."

Story wise there isn't much to shout about it's just the good guys vs the bad. Visually, however, this is jaw droppingly amazing stuff. Beautiful colouring and some real imagination is on display here and this is enough to cement over the cracks of a screenplay that is at its best when batting out funny one liners. There are loads of jokes about the food characters on show. I particularly liked the 'leek on the boat  gag, and the one about cutting the cheese is proof positive that toons are no longer positioning themselves just for kids (Para Norman made that perfectly clear). The animal/food names are very inventive what with shrimpanzees, flamangos, tacodiles and melophants, and if  the humour at times is a bit corny (pun intended) it non the less raises a smile and is often very funny. Even the requisite cute character, a strawberry with the oh so original name of Berry!, is more tolerable than usual. Good fun."

But its time now people to understand animations too would have such low movies like this.\r Whatever you thought might be, but in my view and for my age, it did not please me like other animation features. I don't know about teenagers, but children will enjoy it for sure more than anybody else. I have not denoted the movie had flaws in the technical aspect, but the theme divides the audience as per age differece.\r The dialogues were what kept me alive. Many of them were very hilarious. One of it was 'It's enough to make a grown man cry. But not this man. Get back in there, tear'. In some portion the character Chester V annoyed me, I think that is what they wanted from a villain character.\r This movie itself an unnecessary follow-up so I don't want another sequel unless they initiate back the first movie concept of what title is represented.

While directors and writers Phil Lord and Chris Miller were busy on The LEGO Movie, Sony whipped up a sequel, hiring the writer of The Incredible Burt Wonderstone and the director of Open Season 2, and while the critics seem to like it quite a bit, I felt that Sony Pictures Animation disappointed me yet again.\r Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 has potential with its inventive designs, environmentalism and sweetness, but unfortunately it is only half the wit of the first, most of its attempts at comedy being food puns that start to get boring, repeats of whatever was funny in the first or even itself, none of them succeeding, and typical Hollywood poop jokes to make sure it doesn't get a G rating, the worst thing that can ever happen to a movie!\r The new voice actors lack charisma; Terry Crewes is even less Mr. T than Quinton Jackson and Kristen Schaal is far from Mabel Pines or Louise Belcher. Not to mention the theme of the plot twist has been discussed before in animation history. This is exactly the kind of movie the first one was poking fun at.\r Without Lord and Miller, or even Aardman, Sony Animation seems to be style-over-substance. They have some very talented animators who provide the cartooniest CG animation since the first Madagascar, but the output should be more than eye candy. A year ago, Hotel Transylvania paid more attention to unique animation than an inspired script; the rest was a sponge bathing itself in urine. In this movie, Chicken Brent comes along with the gang just to repeat his catchphrase and fall over repeatedly because FAT PEOPLE ARE COMPLETE DOPES.\r It doesn't help that Sony's big return in 2015 will consist of sequels to that and The Smurfs - as if 2013 wasn't lousy enough."

      "text": "Bottom line: Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 is the best children\u2019s movie I\u2019ve seen in a long time; I'd highly recommend it to anyone and especially those with children.\r I remember reading Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, or at least having it read to me, when I was little. I was apprehensive when the first CwaCoM film came out. I thought the animation was too wiggly and I didn\u2019t like the idea that they changed around the story. I didn\u2019t even see it. Flash forward to last night, at her request, my fianc\u00e9e and I watched the recently released sequel. It was such a good decision.\r Just like any sequel, the movie begins with a plot refreshment but it was short and sweet. It brought me up to speed and smoothly transitioned into the new movie. From a young age, Flint Lockwood has dreamed of becoming a world changing scientist/inventor like his hero, the CEO of Live Corp, Chester V. Flint eventually makes a device that changes water into food. The machine malfunctions causing the island on which Flint, his family and friends live to overflow with food. Flint destroys the device to prevent a global catastrophe. He and his friends decide to make a lab together to invent and change the world. Chester V (well, a hologram of Chester V) arrives to the food covered island and invites the islanders to live in San Franjose, CA. Flint is given a job at Live Corp, a science company whose flagship product is the Live Bar.\r Live Corp, and Chester V, is a source of constant, funny jabs at Apple and Steve Jobs. The Live Corp logo, a light bulb, is everywhere in the sleek, white design of the company headquarters: the building is a giant light bulb and it has a fancy light bulb shaped water feature. The entry-level inventors work in a cube farm in the basement of the building, tirelessly inventing for the biannual induction ceremony where one inventor becomes an Inventronaut, the upper echelon of Live Corp employees who have proven their scientific prowess. Numerous \u201ccaffeine stations\u201d provide free coffee while videos of Chester V speaking play at \u201cMotivation Stations\u201d. Meanwhile, back on the island, Flint\u2019s invention wasn\u2019t destroyed. It has continued to create food but the food has evolved to the point that the fruits and vegetables are now food-animal hybrids like Flamangos and Cucumbirds. I am a fan of puns and, if you have seen the trailer, this movie is full of them. Chester V orders Flint to shutdown the machine to save the world from the food-animals.\r I mentioned, previously, that I thought the animation was a little too wiggly. After watching the movie, I can say that I was incorrect; it's colorful and energetic. The same can be said about the humor. It was light, pleasant, and consistent. One of my pet peeves about children\u2019s movies relates to the poor attempts at humor. There are fart jokes, poop jokes, or slapstick. They make me uncomfortable because I don\u2019t think they are funny and I don\u2019t think they should be such a source of humor. Then there are the jokes geared towards the parents because they go over the heads of the children. When I was little, this was a source of frustration. I was aware that there was a joke but I didn\u2019t understand it. I felt like the movie was banishing me to the children's\u2019 table. CwaCoM 2 doesn\u2019t have many of these two types of jokes. It is an accessible movie. \u201cAh! There\u2019s a leek in the boat,\u201d yells Lockwood. The camera cuts over to a vegetable sitting in the boat which returns an equally startled yell. If a child didn\u2019t know what a leek was the jokes would not be lost and it would give the parent/s the opportunity to explain the joke.\r In terms of characters, they are all were pleasant. I loved the relationship between Sam and Flint the most. It is clear that they are a couple but the end goal isn\u2019t to get married and live happily ever after but to make a laboratory and invent. They want to change the world together. Sam is a capable scientist who isn\u2019t relegated to the position of damsel in distress.\r I don\u2019t know how I feel about attitude towards the food-animals. At one point, Sam says, \u201cYou can\u2019t eat them, they are alive!\u201d What are they supposed to eat!? Sam\u2019s objection, of course, is an common reason for becoming a vegetarian but now what are they going to do for food in general? If they shut off the machine, the food-animals will die, but it is stays on, the machine will keep making more. Does this mean people will just have to make sure the food they eat is home grown, or at least, not sentient? Perhaps this is can be interpreted as a statement about responsible food production practices. It isn\u2019t a question the movie directly raises or address, it was just something that came to mind. The main message of the movie is about friendship.\r The sense of humor is refreshing and the animation is bright and happy and so is the story and characters. If I had children, I'd have them watch this movie and would recommend it to anyone looking for a happy movie."

In part two of Flint and his wonderful/monstrous machine, the entire town in now being transported to California while a new character name Chester V. and his crew clean up Swallow Falls. But as Flint and the gang sneak their way back to Swallow Falls after a month, they realized that Flint's machine had created an entire forest with the food being alive and representing animals. Such as Shrimpanzees, Watermelephants, and tomatoes! The movie features the same protagonists from the first film, so nobody was missed out. And all the jokes are pretty much low humor comedy that you'd typically see in your average animated movie, but CWaCoM2 does it in such a way that it is 10 times more hilarious. The only real issue with this movie is the moral. Or should I say, the ridiculously obvious moral. Unless your really into animals and nature, I wouldn't look so much into the moral of the story. But overall, a hilarious and charming movie."

To write this review I first had to read something about the first movie, which I haven't seen yet but will see. So I won't say if this movie fits in well with the movie that precedes it ... maybe later I have a clearer idea. I will look only at this movie.The script is interesting: In the first movie, after an accident, a weird machine starts making live food to the point where the city needs to be evacuated. Its inventor, Flint Lockwood, eventually destroys the machine, saves the world, and is eventually called to work with Chester V, a world famous scientist he idolizes. In this movie, however, everyone finds that the island is still populated with animals made of food, the machine is still active and needs to be turned off. However, as Flint gets closer to his idol, he becomes detached from his friends and unknowingly enters a sinister and mysterious scheme set up by Chester V, which is not quite as innocent as it seems.Okay ... I confess this movie sounds surrealistic. Animals made from food and live food is something we don't see every day and it sounds pretty childish and boring for adults. It was one of the reasons why the movie didn't catch my eye when it circulated in theaters. I think I made a mistake. The film is not childish, and has a lot of material that will please or at least entertain a more adult audience that accompanies children to the cinema. The plot involves some more adult themes, such as betrayal and falsehood, the importance of friendships and the role of parents in the lives of their children, even suggests a romance between the protagonist and his best friend. There is also an environmental message implicit in the film. The characters are interesting and appealing, the villain oscillates between the sinister and the hilarious ...Technically, there is little to say. The work of the voice actors is impeccable, as expected, and the quality of the animation is superb, the state of the art today. Vivid, colorful, vibrant and imaginative, this film is a visual spectacle. Of course, there are strong appeals to sentimentality and the construction of animals has been designed for it. The soundtrack also sounds pretty good, with one or two songs that can be easily heard.Far from perfect or remarkable, this is a good animated movie. Not being too childish, it has enough material to please children, adults and teenagers. I don't waste the time watching this movie, even though I've seen it a lot better."
