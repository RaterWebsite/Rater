  "description": "Scott has been a case of arrested development ever since his firefighter father died when he was seven. He's now reached his mid-20s having achieved little, chasing a dream of becoming a tattoo artist that seems far out of reach. As his ambitious younger sister heads off to college, Scott is still living with his exhausted ER nurse mother and spends his days smoking weed, hanging with the guys \u2014 Oscar, Igor and Richie \u2014 and secretly hooking up with his childhood friend Kelsey. But when his mother starts dating a loudmouth firefighter named Ray, it sets off a chain of events that will force Scott to grapple with his grief and take his first tentative steps toward moving forward in life.",

It is the typical experience for aimless young men who have collapsed under the pressure of our society (and trauma of loss). But this movie is really boring, unfocused, and annoying. As an Apatow movie, it is easily one of his weakest attempts. The faux naturalistic dialogue comes off pretty cringey and the characters are all fairly one dimensional. I could see enjoying this film when I was just getting into film as a young lad, but today it just feels like a waste of everyone's time."

      "text": "Honestly, I'm not a fan of Apatow's work or really him personally. I find his public persona to be that of a pandering, hypocritical Centrist hack. That said, after seeing the trailer and knowing a bit about Pete Davidson's personal backstory, I was looking forward to something a little funnier and with possibly some genuine heart. I was disappointed. I like Pete but the material here didn't really give him an opportunity to be very funny or show any emotional range. He was more or less a pet goldfish through the whole thing. It was like \"Yeah, he's moving and doing stuff but is watching this entertaining to people who aren't stoned... or even those who are?\" I mean, there are little bits and pieces of a character arc for Pete but they feel like teases for some bigger evolution that never happens. There's nothing that is clearly defined here. There is a lot of meandering in terms of story, wasted minutes that didn't need to be there, as with most of Apatow's films. And this film really doesn't have the truly poignant moments that allow an actor to show emotional range and show a clear pivot for the character. Does Pete's character grow or change over the course of the film? Maybe a little but somebody should have told his face that because he seems to have the same look on it through the whole thing. There was an opportunity for a really good, funny, moving film here and it was missed by a fairly wide margin. It's too bad because this could have been the career transforming vehicle for Pete that allows him to move on to film stardom and he seems like a nice guy."

      "text": "This was the latest film from Judd Apatow ('Knocked Up', 'The 40-Year-Old Virgin') and stars 'Saturday Night Live' star Pete Davidson as a slacker living with his mom in Staten Island trying to figure his future out and pursue his dreams of being a tattoo artist. He also tries to come to terms with his mom's new boyfriend, following the death of his firefighter father. This film is actually rather semi-autobiographical, as Davidson really did lose his firefighter father in real life due to the 9/11 attacks and currently lives in Staten Island. I've always found Davidson to be a pretty funny guy, and his comedic skills and even a surprising amount of dramatic skills are on display here with him, as he turns in some rather heartfelt moments in this. Marisa Tomei also turns in some great work as his mother, and even Steve Buscemi has a small role in this as a firefighter (Buscemi also happened to serve as a firefighter during the 9/11 attacks.) Really my only issue is that the film's runtime feels a little too stretched out, but otherwise, it's got plenty of laughs and tender moments to spare."

      "text": "I'm a little surprised at both the user and the critic scores here. I thought that this was a really well put together film that had a lot of charm and explored something worth while. Possibly it's because people went into watching this thinking it was a \"comedy.\" I can understand how it not really being one could put viewers off. I found the movie to be pretty funny, but I had no expectations going into it because I though it was a drama before I started watching. (I really liked the Action Bronson sequence.) All of this said I thought the acting, story and cinematography where outstanding. When I say I'm not a big Pete Davidson fan it's not because I don't like him. I've literally never seen him in anything except a Comedy Central Roast, but I loved him here. He was fantastic. Both him and Bill Burr are so easy to connect with in this. I've seen some complaints about how long this movie is, but I never felt like it overstayed it's welcome. While I think the pacing of the story is fairly good, I do think that it took a little too long for it to get to what I'd consider the 3rd act. The thing is though, I'm not sure who this movie is for entirely? We all know or have that one person in our lives who is great and talented, but who also needs to get it together. This movie lets us root for them. I appreciate that because many times I feel like I am that person who needs to get it together."

He is credited as writing or co-writing and that right there on top of his acting, the casting is near perfect - big home run in my opinion that Davidson may not be able to take a victory lap for. Wherever the movie lags, or looses its narrative threads - overall I was extremely impressed. Bill Burr's casting and performance really brings it together in a wonderful way. I may be biased or see things in this film, due to my own experiences losing my father when I was 19, others may not. I really enjoyed it and I came in expecting to hate it. Note: I actually had to shut it off after the first 20 mins and had to try again because I thought I knew where things were going. So glad I was wrong. Damn, so many good performances."

      "text": "Pete Davidson\u2019s first starring role was in Big Time Adolescence, which showcased his solid acting skills. This newer film was created/directed by comedy icon Judd Apatow, but it\u2019s not really that funny. It\u2019s more of a character drama with Davidson at the center. In a scenario inspired by his own life, he plays a slacker living at home with his mom (Marisa Tomei) and still grappling with the death of his firefighter father when he was seven. The film rambles thru his days, getting stoned with friends and other useless activities. When mom forms a relationship with another firefighter, it causes the predictable conflict. While the situations are interesting and the cast creates uniformly interesting characters, the focus is on Davidson, who once again demonstrates his undeniable charisma and considerable acting talent."

      "text": "I have to admit, my interest in this project hinged almost entirely on Bill Burr's involvement and, in this admittedly flawed regard, I suppose \"The King Of Staten Island\" doesn't necessarily disappoint. There are some memorable Burr-isms throughout (rants, one-liners, ball-busting, etc.), but this obviously isn't the Bill Burr show. So, as a semi-autobiographical look into the life and struggles of Pete Davidson, I can say \"The King Of Staten Island\" does well enough. Some have offered up criticisms involving the likability of the lead character and I'll surely sit for those. My main, protagonist-centric gripe really only involves the amount of inertia present within him for such a long portion of the movie. I understand that laziness and disillusionment are big parts of the character's inner turmoil, but having to follow someone with no inclination for any sort of activity can spell for a trying watch. This was that kind of watch for me at times. You're also handed the typical, Apatow-ian pitfalls \u2014 directionless scenes, bloated running times, etc. \u2014 which I always expect, but somehow never quite get used to. It helps that the third act is actually the best part of the movie this time around, something I never thought I'd say about an Apatow film since \"the 40-Year-Old Virgin.\" In any case, though, this remains an ultimately enjoyable, yet occasionally rough offering."

      "text": "No matter how hard the filmmakers and cast tried to sell this story of an angst-ridden millennial perpetually mourning the loss of his firefighter father, I didn't buy it -- not for a minute, despite a semi-autobiographical story and script by protagonist Pete Davidson. Director Judd Apatow's overlong, unfocused comedy (a term I use loosely) takes far too long to find its feet, and it does so with an endless string of snappy, smarmy one-liners that don't jibe with the supposedly fragile mental state of the allegedly troubled lead character. And, when the film finally does start to move forward, the narrative's warm, fuzzy conclusion lacks plausibility in light of its cynical setup, a problem made worse by steaming heaps of melodrama and inordinately saintly characters primed for canonization. While the picture genuinely features a fine performance by Marisa Tomei, its attempt at making Davidson's character into more than the one-dimensional player he is sorely falls short, a fate not unlike that shared by many other former SNL regulars who have attempted to transition from the small to the big screen. In all, the premise here is shaky to begin with, and it's made all the worse by too many tangents, insufficient clarity and poor execution, suspicions that first surfaced when I screened the trailer and that became all too apparent while sitting through this endless slog."

Marisa Tomei and Bill Burr gave phenomenal supporting performances, they very both were really funny and Marisa had great emotional depth to her performance as well. Bel Powley, Steve Buscemi, Rickey Velez, Maude Apatow, and Mois\u00e9s Arias gave funny performances. The writing was exceptional, it was hilarious and had great depth and emotional weight. The character development was stupendous especially with Scott. The costumes were fantastic especially ones wore by Pete Davidson, Bel Powley, and Marisa Tomei.

Pete Davidson and Bill Burr are easily the best parts about this film. I\u2019ve never been a huge fan of Davidson but he really fits here. Burr brings his usual funny attitude here but shows a more sympathetic and kindhearted side which is nice to see. The biggest issue with this film is the screenplay. It feels like the first draft which means some of the dialogue is pretty rough. Some of the characters dialogue feels awkward and unnatural. I definitely would have enjoyed this film more if they had spent more time on the screenplay. The film is also about 30 minutes too long and that\u2019s a complaint I\u2019ve heard about a lot of Judd Apatow movies. A lot of moments could have either been cut out or just shortened. With all that aside, the film is well shot and I did get a couple of laughs here and there. Check this out if you want or if you like Pete Davidson and Bill Burr."
