The screen adaption of this criticly praised book (I haven't read) is very good directed, has a simply fantastic score, magnificient cinematography and highly talented actors. I admit that it could've been shorter and the love story gets too kitschy partly, however it's the best movie of 1996 and totally touching!"

      "text": "and you never want to talk..The English PatientFew high pitched dramatic sequences are shot so beautifully that it is almost impossible not to be moved by it but ticking for around 160 minutes the build of the scrutiny is chewed off way too much before it even hits the screen. Anthony Minghella's adaptation isn't smart enough to match its brilliant execution skills that helps connect the dots no matter how much time it consumes. Ralph Fiennes is brilliant in his portrayal and is supported thoroughly by a great supporting cast like Juliette Binoche, Willem Dafoe and Colin Firth. The English Patient is a character driven feature where it goes boldly to a dark place and still somehow manages to keep it beautiful and filled with hope where the key lies onto its moving performance."

This is classic, and I wish we had more movies as deep as this one is...I think it is about time for me to watch it again. Not a 10, but a 9 for sure! I highly recommend it."

      "text": "Don't let the Seinfeld episode convince you otherwise; The English Patient is nowhere near as bad as Elaine says. Instead, it is actually quite good. It is quite long, but it never becomes boring and plus, the visuals are so stunningly beautiful throughout, there is no way for you to possibly become bored anyways. Wondrously crafted and bold in scope, The English Patient may not be truly brilliant, but director Anthony Minghella certainly did a fantastic job. However, I will say I never found this one too romantic. People gush about how romantic it is, but it is simply about two scumbags who wind up having sex with one another. Maybe I am just jaded and have extra hatred for cheaters, but anyways. Ralph Fiennes is fantastic, as are Juliette Binoche, Willem Dafoe, Kristin Scott Thomas, Naveen Andrews, and Colin Firth. Though I did not find the love story to be charming or romantic, the story told by Fiennes' character is still incredibly moving and full of human drama. The romantic part of the film, to me, would be aimed at the desert, which is beautifully captured at both its best and its worst. A captivating World War II romantic drama, The English Patient is quite long and could stand to be shorter, nor it is particularly impactful, but it remains a beautiful film that does not deserve the negative impression I had going in."

Your assumed friends may suspect you, and your supposed enemy might respect you, that\u2019s why Alm\u00e1sy is delayed in rescuing his ankle-injured lover, and why the vengeful Caravaggio gives up revenge after knowing all these. A traitor is not a traitor when he himself is betrayed by some peremptory authority, and when such betrayal is necessitated by great love."

It's breathtakingly shot, and the score astonishing. Juliette Binoche, Ralph Fiennes and Kristen Scott Thomas give emotional, powerful performances on top of everything that is so great about this film.\rIt has a non-linear structure which is perfect for a longer film like this because it sucks you into it more and keeps you focused on the edge of your seat.\rThe script is perfect, the costume design is beautiful, the production design is believable, the cinematography is top notch, the editing is flawless, and this grade A, all star ensemble cast is one of the best you'll see in years.\r Dont believe the haters, watch '''The English Patient'', it's an absolute masterpiece."

      "text": "\"The English Patient\" has long been transformed into one of the most classic films of romantic cinema, but it seems that the public has had little appreciation or patience for romantic movies, particularly if they are very long and slow. Based on a novel by Michael Ondaatje (which I have), its located in Italy at the end of World War II, telling the story of a military nurse being in a ruined house to assist an aviator who was terribly injured in a plane crash. So, this movie was intended for a public that wants to follow the story, savor all moments, follow the emotions of the characters. The script makes a good adaptation of the book. Scenarios and costumes have been thought through to detail and the period elements have been well recreated and are historically suitable. Visually, the film is excellent: great cinematography, with Italian and North African landscapes dazzling the audience. Ralph Fiennes was excellent in the lead role, achieving one of the most remarkable works of his career. Juliette Binoche was not as surprising as him, but she was well in her role. To be fair, the only problem in this film is the overly slow pace, making it overly sentimental in some scenes. I understand the idea and the intention behind, but everything has its limits and even honey can make you sick."

      "text": "Stylish film about the beauty of extreme self-centered melodrama. Hated it from the early scene where the heroine walks into a minefield to retrieve a memento of a dead friend. If she wants to blow herself up, go ahead, but she had no right to endanger the other two men trying to clear the mines. From there, it goes on to justify helping the Nazis if you're melancholy enough."

The story is an accumulation of illogical developments that were totally unnecessary to portray a destructive passion that was big by itself. I give a 3 in recognition of cinematographer work."

How come the Academy chose a 3-hour-long passionate love story and win a Best Picture Oscar? I skipped on the final ending of the Oscars in 1997 and I was so pissed. There's a reason why Joel and Ethan Cohen were not too pleased with the stunning news because Fargo should've won the goddamn Oscar in the first place. I believe it's one the most embarrassing Best Picture winners and some people agree with me that The English Patient is completely overrated. Shame on You, AMPAS!"

The truth is that this movie is a jewel of the 90's and a masterpiece of the seventh art. The movie is amazing so there is beauty in the lines, the soundtrack and the cinematography, a masterpiece that will never be forgotten."
