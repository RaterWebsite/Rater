  "description": "Alex, Marty, and other zoo animals find a way to escape from Madagascar when the penguins reassemble a wrecked airplane. The precariously repaired craft stays airborne just long enough to make it to the African continent. There the New Yorkers encounter members of their own species for the first time. Africa proves to be a wild place, but Alex and company wonder if it is better than their Central Park home.",

Considerably better than the original film, and as someone else pointed out, hard to see how it could have been much better. Lots of droll movie references and in-jokes (The Lion King in particular gets a good workout) and one of the best scripts of 2008. Oddly enough, because it has so many in-jokes, it is probably a slightly better film for adults than it is for children, which makes me drop a point off what it might have been. But one of the best films of the year anyway."

This is particularly impressive since as an 18-26 yr. old male I'm not exactly the key demo group. My girlfriend loved the first movie so of course we had to go see the new one opening day. So it is safe to say that I was dragged to this movie and didn't expect to enjoy it in the least. The plot is not overly deep, and a lot of it is predictable kid stuff or scenes redone from other movies, but unlike other movies seem to try too hard to parody other flicks, I found myself laughing along with the kids more often than not. The silly gags will all there of course, but what really made me laugh were the more obscure adult references. Examples include: King Julian describing how he would invade a foreign country and force his political ideology on the inhabitants if he only had a few days to live, or the scene in which the monkeys are negotiating with the penguins and they are referred to as \"Communists\" because they unionized. The bottom line? Mad 2 is smart, funny, and definitely worth your time. If your kids want to see it, take them. You'll enjoy it at least as much as they will."

      "text": "So how will \"Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa\" play in Kansas? Sick of the cronyism he encountered at KU fraternities, Thomas Frank(author of the political and cultural critique \"What's the Matter with Kansas: How Conservatives Won the Heart of America\") left the Sunflower State, and became a democrat. While attending meetings for the Young Republicans, a wide-eyed Frank felt like an outsider; soon jaded, he quickly realized that the party of his youth on the Jayhawk campus, was more about harboring power than the promotion of ideals. In \"Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa\", fate thwarts the destiny that awaits Alex(Ben Stiller), who instead of being King of the Animal Preservation(read: the sequestered world invented by the Cons, not the real world(read: the jungle) unencumbered by party ideology), ends up as an entertainer in a New York zoo(read: lion as the liberal elite). Leaders of the ultra-right incite their Conservative Evangelical constituency with unfounded claims that the so-called liberal media and their latte-sipping subscribers are laughing at Middle America and their cultural bent for all-things-Orthodox. Not only was Alex a Young Lion(read: College(or Young) Republican), he was next in line to lead(read: W.) the animal preservation, and would be considered a God by all the lion-fearing animals. To his feral parents, and counterparts, Alex is a dancing fool; completely worthless, a wuss. For a lion to earn his spurs in the imitative Africa(not the real Africa), fighting is the only currency. The subtly satirical \"Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa\" turns the culture wars on its heels. It's Alex, the coded liberal, who is being persecuted. Late in the film, the satire grows more playful when Alex saves his own life, and his disapproving father's life, by performing for the safari tourists, led by an ultra-violent old lady(read: pro-hunting conservative), who ironically, permit the two lions to live because they can see that a lion well-versed in the dancing philosophy of Bob Fosse has worth. In this sequel to the uneven \"Madagascar\", there's a surprisingly savvy parable about our country's current political climate, that shouldn't be written off in favor of the penguin and monkey show."

While it is not laugh at loud funny the film has a lot more heart, the main characters while still just alright I actually have a reason to care for them this time around, the penguins are used better, and the animation looks nice. I\u2019m not going to recommend this film as it is not as good as something like Shrek 1 & 2 or Kung Fu Panda; however, this is a passable film and if you want something passable then this is it. Fans of the first film should check this out as it has more of the same characters and nice humor. This isn\u2019t a drastic improvement so much as it will win people over who didn\u2019t like the first one but if you are going into this film expecting another somewhat annoying film don\u2019t worry it\u2019s a bit better than the first one. This film is nothing but ok but it surpassed the first one and that\u2019s good enough for me. It\u2019s a rental, which is a lot more than I can say for other animated films like The Wild."

      "text": "There\u2019s a nuttier, generally more diverting entertainment creeping, crawling and waddling along the edges of \u201cMadagascar: Escape 2 Africa\u201d than the larger one lollygagging on screen. This central story of this new animated movie, written by Etan Cohen and the directors Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath, involves Alex (Ben Stiller in low gear), a lion who in 2005 journeyed from New York captivity (i.e., a zoo) to the jungle in the first \u201cMadagascar\u201d with the usual mix of celebrity-voiced racial and ethnic stereotypes: a motor-mouthed zebra, Marty (Chris Rock); a nice if woefully neurotic giraffe, Melman (David Schwimmer); and the token girl, a hippo with a sizeable caboose named Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith).\r Three years later Alex and company are literally ejected from Madagascar in a rickety plane operated by a penguin crew that\u2019s led by the supremely confident, quite possibly insane Skipper (Mr. McGrath), a sleek ball of feathers and fat who simultaneously brings to mind Jon Lovitz, Phil Hartman, John Wayne and a cue ball. Along with his two sidekicks, a couple of stooges called Kowalski and Private (Chris Miller and Christopher Knights), Skipper keeps first the plane and then \u2014 after crash-landing on an African savannah \u2014 the movie moving with his deadpan delivery and with some surrealistic nonsense involving a barrel of laughing monkeys. (I see a big future for Mason and his silent partner, Phil, the two-chimp team whose lah-di-dah manners and sartorial flair recall that of the 1970s television ape, Lancelot Link.)\r With King Julien, a deranged lemur whose daft non sequiturs and bon mots are dropped and dribbled with dexterity and control by an unrecognizable Sacha Baron Cohen (at times sounding like a less frantic Robin Williams), the penguins and chimps could have skittered into something memorable. Alas, the filmmakers, who clearly are having as much fun visually with these scene stealers as they are aurally, stick by the contemporary American animation playbook: Alex has a dream (gotta dance), father issues (with Bernie Mac as the pride of the pride) and a requisite baddie rival (Alec Baldwin, who else?). There\u2019s also an unfunny old lady with a Jackie Mason accent who deserves a violently cruel end, but this is a PG movie.\r Mr. Darnell and Mr. McGrath don\u2019t appear especially committed to these stale conceits and character dynamics, which may explain why they spend so much time playing with the penguins, chimps and King Julien, who may not roar but certainly rules. There\u2019s true playfulness here whenever this wacky animal pack takes over, a suggestion of delirium echoed by the zippy, at times overly zooming camerawork with its roller-coaster dips and swoops. And while the filmmakers throw the camera around almost as much as Brian De Palma does, every so often they slow down, giving you a chance to scan the softly muted colors of the landscapes and explore how the exaggerated character designs create a nice visual contrast with the photorealistic details and flourishes.\r It\u2019s unsurprising that Alex\u2019s mane registers as more realistic than any of his words or emotions, but it\u2019s also a bummer. \u201cEscape 2 Africa\u201d is good enough in patches to make its distracting star turns, storybook clich\u00e9s and stereotypes harder to take than they would be in a less enjoyable movie. Casting Mr. Stiller and Mr. Schwimmer may sear their brands onto under-age cerebral cortices but does nothing for the movie. And, really, did the hippo (voiced by will.i.am from the Black Eyed Peas) who courts Gloria with a low rumble and a suggestive shimmy have to sound like Barry White rather than, say, Marc Anthony or Justin Timberlake? I laughed, but honestly, if this country can vote colorblind surely its movie studios can animate colorblind too. (Can\u2019t they?)"

      "text": "Usually, when a film achieves remarkable financial success, the film industry arranges for space for one or two sequels. This is what happened with \"Madagascar\", but the sequel was able to maintain the initial level of quality. In this film, the attempt of the four zoo animals to return to the US fails and, by great coincidence (this only happens in the films), they end up falling in Central Africa, in the animal reserve where Alex was born, which allows him to know his parents and origins. The film is very good and fun, it retains most of the cast and voice actors of the original film and adds or recovers some characters, such as the Elder Lady, who gains some protagonism here, alongside Alex's parents. I also noticed that some characters who, in the initial movie, were secondary, were now approached for a more central space, a measure that was certainly the response to the affection they gained from the public. This is the case, for example, of King Julian. The four central characters do not change much, but the script tried to give them more space and attention to counterbalance the weight of several charismatic secondary characters. The script recaptures an old tradition of animated films and creates moments where it conveys moralistic messages, especially regarding the differences between individuals (the events between Melman and Gloria and Marty's dilemma with the other zebras are just two examples). Personally, I have nothing against this militancy implied in the film. Voice actors continue to perform flawlessly, as well as drawings, animations, and cinematography. Oddly enough, this movie is very poor in music or great songs. There are some, but none deserve particular attention."
