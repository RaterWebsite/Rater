Dwayne Johnson could've phoned it in and got a check for his time, but instead goes through the whole film looking like he actually enjoyed the acting process. This is a decent family film, much better than Disney's recently released, abysmal Snow Buddies."

      "text": "We know the drill. We know the narcissistic jock will be taught a life lesson or two from his long-lost daughter so why not make the transformation more meaningful and let Joe Kingman(Dwayne Johnson) be a complete utter a-hole? The star quarterback is an egomaniac but seems like a nice enough guy. When Peyton(Madison Pettis) shows up at his door, we should feel as if this arrangement of parent and child will never pan out. That's why \"The Game Plan\" is hopelessly innocuous; a family film that suggests, but glosses over the very real issue of promiscuous athletes and their illegitimate children. This Disney production is technically yet another family-friendly sports film, but the most exciting example of kinetic activity isn't the big football game; it's a handsomely mounted ballet recital. \"The Game Plan\", however, intended or not, manages to sling one pointed satirical arrow at the culture of modern athletics. Joe is allergic to cinnamon. The spice would seem hard to miss but he eats the cookies his daughter baked for him in seemingly blissful ignorance. Joe is like the athlete who claims he didn't knowingly ingest HGH(human growth hormones). \"The Game Plan\" could've used more edgy moments such as this. It suffers from an overdose of cuteness."

Maybe it was the popcorn that of which is giving me lumps on my body? Is this it? Is this all the rock has to offer? Yeah, sure the story is fine, but the movie itself never stays focused, it never is on a certain balance. The main attention is the humor, which surprisingly is funny, and the Rock isn't all that bad in this, to me he sucks as an actor. In The Scorpion King he smelt. But in this he wasn't bad, as a Football player, that maybe his best role so far. That little girl though is so annoying, and the most of the comedy near the end wasn't there, I didn't catch any. It was too light hearted, very weak, and overplayed, the ending was like any other ending, maybe they could at least try something different than just showing the final game and let the good team win. It is so predictable, and obvious, the dialogue made me roll my eyes because dah they were gonna' say that. But the rest of the movie is okay and funny, but the only real engaging thing about the movie is the Football parts, those parts are good. just the ending wasted the whole movie, and after a while it seemed like the movie ran out of ideas. I just don't get why there has to be such a boring plot, because you know in some movies like Master and Commander: The far Side of the World is predictable but done very well. I love that movie, I adore it, it is the best movie of its year, it beats Pirates, the best Pirate movie ever. And it got 10 Academy Awards, by Russell Crowe, he performances excellently. You know I rather would rate this movie a 10 and talk about Master and commander than this, I would but I just have a few things to say about The Game Plan. So, overall, do not watch this movie, it is not worth it, nor for free, I watched 3:10 To yuma for free because the manager gave us free passes due to poor service last time at the Theatre, but don't waste your free Sunady night to go to a movie with free movie passes to this when you can go see a good movie. Believe me, this movie sucks. I fell asleep for the first time ever in a theatre, this movie is so boring. Period. I never fell asleep in Epic Movie and it was terrible, worth a 0/10, and at least it had exciting things happening, with stupid but fun context from beginning to end."

You can't just say you are her Dad, when you would be knowing her your entire lfe if you had a Kid. So where did she come from? Is this a joke, because it sin't funny. There are so many flaws that is horrible."

      "text": "This is a Disney movie, so its obviously one that all the family can watch, as it has a universal rating. Its somewhere between a general family movie and a comedy and indeed there are some pretty funny moments in it. I haven't seen a Disney movie, even if it is live action, for a while, since I think that one with Tommy Lee Jones being made a fool out of (the one where he's in a house with cheerleaders lol) but I thought it'd be good for a laugh to see this one as this time its butch Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson playing the lead role and having to deal with a VERY witty little girl, which was indeed, quite amusing!There are some gags that adults will note and enjoy, such as the license plates on Joe's cars and then of course there's the visual gags which im sure children of all ages will enjoy, such as when Joe is making a nutritious smoothie full of food that you wouldn't expect to see go into a blender, put it that way! and Peyton ends up lifting the lid as its blending it and it goes everywhere.Its also quite amusing to see 'The Rock' attempt to do ballet as he gets involved with Peytons ballet class (it turns out that there's quite a twist in the story which requires her to take photos of herself in the ballet class she goes to), like I say I'm all for seeing such people make a fool of themselves I must say haha! also the actress who plays the ballet instructor is Roselyn Sanchez, who you might know from the US drama show 'Without A Trace' (she plays Elena Delgado). Its clear from the movie that 'The Rock' and Madison Pettis, who plays the girl Peyton, got on quite well, or they certainly acted quite well I thought, the two of them are pretty animated (pardon the Disney related pun) and it is interesting to see how Joe responds to some of Peytons more challenging questions. Seeing how the other members of Joes football team respond to him having a more feminine side to himself is also amusing at points and its also quite typically Disney in terms of the story and what the moral is about, in terms of the importance of family above everything else (Joe says early on in the movie that all that matters to him is football, nothing else).Its pretty obvious stuff but it is a family movie and a Disney one at that and its certainly not un-entertaining.The movie is pretty amusing in points and im sure if you watched it with some younger viewers, you would enjoy it with them enough for it to be worth watching, so yes I would recommend it. Its a decent enough Disney movie and it had me laughing a few times - you can't beat a decent Disney movie! its hardly earth shattering stuff but it could be worse."
