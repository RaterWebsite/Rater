I mean, this is truly one of the best movies that I have ever seen, and one that I will tell all my friends to watch. The tension and the unique atmosphere it builds is truly remarkable, the lead actor who I never even heard of before gave an astonishing performance. And don't even get me started on the soundtrack. Great movie, don't miss it!"

Great stuff."

Dan Stevens oozes cool from every pore and I just want to climb inside his body and be him. The synthwave music is very well done, kicking in nicely to build up the tension leading up to climactic scenes. The whole thing has an old-school 70's feel about it. The acting is superb and the action scenes are well filmed and intense. The film keeps you guessing right up until the last minute so the pacing from start to finish is spot on.It's good to see these quirky little films still being made, especially with some known faces in them. More like this please Mr Director man"

But as a series of accidental deaths occurs, the welcomed man soon turns into a suspect.\r Before seeing this movie I known nothing about it. I haven't heard anyone talking about it so I pretty much went in with a open mind knowing nothing, and after viewing I can say that The Guest is freaking amazing and brilliantly flawless with one of the best soundtracks I heard since the 2011 movie Drive.\r Dan Stevens did a outstanding performance as the nice guy that has a dark and uneasy side to him, which Stevens nailed that and I would love to see him in more movies. The rest of the cast did really good as well.\r The soundtrack in this movie is just so beautiful to listen to, and it may be the best soundtrack I've heard since Drive and all John Carpenter movie soundtrack. The soundtrack had that 80's and 90's nostalgic feeling to it which made the movie and the soundtrack even more awesome. No words can describe it, it should be viewed by people who love nostalgic music and movie lovers.\r The cinematography and the writing in the movie was just top notch and this has to be the biggest surprises of the year for me, because I wasn't expecting how fantastic and well done it was. I'm not going to give it the perfect rating as I thought I was going to give, because I don't this movie was \"The best movie ever made\", no it's really not, but still this movie is awesome."

      "text": "Creepy stranger premise has been used in horror or mystery to varied effect, the latest Jennifer Lopez's flick is an example of how not to welcome this premise. Luckily, The Guest has the luxury of having suave lead actor and good atmosphere for a thriller. Some of the kinks are predictable, but the dark humor as well as bizarre revelations offer much needed novelty to the movie.\r David (Dan Stevens) arrives at the Petersons resident, claiming that he was a friend of their fallen son. He's well-mannered and seems trustworthy, thus the family welcomes him openly. Upon his stay, strange accidents begin to happen, and suspicion arises with the casualties. The most important hook is Dan Stevens' portrayal of David. He looks like a rugged debonair, this is not average smooth, this is Ryan Gosling's level of smoothness.\r Stevens delivers a wide variety of emotions, he can be either friendly or deadly. Backed by good cast, such as Maika Monroe as the Anna Peterson and Lance Reddick as Mayor Carver, the movie has a solid degree on acting performance. The exchange of banter is enjoyable, often resulting in manipulation or downright violence for David\u2019s benefit. It elevates the human drama between him, the Peterson family and whoever unlucky enough to be in their immediately vicinity.\r Mystery of David's real identity is crafted slowly and it's compelling enough to pique interest without revealing too much. The film also has a touch of humor, albeit slightly crude. Strangely, in the third act it changes tone drastically for the climax. This shift is a bit odd considering it plays the thriller aspect with steady pace for the majority of early parts, although this explosive tone does have the merit of being entertaining.\r There are short bursts of Hollywood style carnage, but they are modest, not all out gunblazing from the start like Bourne or the recent John Wick. Action sequences are well choreographed, it has both devastating and ridiculous impact.. Good practical effect for the blood and explosion as well as its highly unorthodox soundtracks make the faster pace scenes more satisfying.\r Having good mesh of action, mystery and comedy, The Guest is enigmatically fascinating."

Dan Stevens is fantastic in the lead role, while Maika Monroe turns in a supporting performance that provides further proof of her brilliance. This film really manages to heighten suspense throughout and has a chilling coolness that both pulls you in and scares you that really underscores how cold and calculated everything done in the film is. In addition, the film is also really shot and has some great production design and the final act as a whole is brilliant and wraps the film up brilliantly.

Big thanks I didn't audibly fart at that very moment or I might have been lost in the story's conclusion. (Yes, that was sarcasm)\r On the plus side Dan Stevens was convincing from start to stop. Something felt legitimately off from his very first smile. His revelation from defenders of the defenseless to just plain balls out crazy off his rocker was truly scary to watch. It's a shame 10-15 min of back story wasnt invested in us.
