  "description": "It was a chance meeting started by one of Sol\u2019s friends trying to chat up Jennifer. However, in the end, it was those two who hit it off. Sol enjoyed Jen\u2019s smile, her effort, and how silly she could be. Jen enjoyed Sol\u2019s cooking, his athleticism, and that he would join her in fun moments. As you can imagine, love bloomed, and things got serious. Jen\u2019s investment in Sol led to her pushing him to follow his dreams and even move in to save money. Sol\u2019s investment in Jen well, it led to him proposing. But what started as a liver tumor grew into full-on cancer, so with a diagnosis of 6 months to live, Sol and Jennifer try to make the best of it.",

      "text": "2020 has brought us many things film wise. It hasn't been the greatest year and there's really no need to rush out to the theaters for this. But the film is a reminder of a simpler time when entertaining three hankie romantic dramas such as this would crowd multiplexes. Conceptually it's pretty generic and all the cliches are in place but the attractive and talented stars make it worth the watch. Jessica Rothe of Happy Death Day and Harry Shum Jr. Of Glee have awesome chemistry. The film tells the true story of a couple who are about to get married when they discover one of them has cancer. The movie is funny, moving and sad and as an added bonus at the end we meet the real couple. Sure I wished for just a bit more originality but was happy with this endearing little gem.***.5/5"

      "text": "This movie was so heartbreaking yet heartwarming at the same time! It had me ugly crying throughout the movie. The acting was great and the fact that it was based on a true story was incredible. I loved the fresh representation in a movie like this and Harry Shum was a great pick for this. They had amazing chemistry. It\u2019s not often you see sexy male Asian American leads and we\u2019re starving for more flicks like this! Highly recommend!!"
