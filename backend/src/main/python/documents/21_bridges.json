This is the production values of Captain America:  Winter Soldier applied to a 1980s NY cops movie script.  It's watchable and well-paced.  Critics imagining director or scripters were attempting to \"say something\" about 2019 I think are imagining things.  I saw no evidence this was more than 1980s tropes assembled and packaged.  Do corrupt cops still do what is suggested here?  I kind of doubt it.  If you want up-to-date realism in your cop stories, you can't do better than Blue Bloods on CBS."

You won\u2019t regret watching it but at the same time it\u2019s probably not going to leave a lasting impression either.Detective Andre Davis (Chadwick Boseman) is a no-nonsense revenge seeking kinda cop who grumbles his way through the entire film set over the course of one night. A robbery gone wrong leads to a city wide manhunt where Andre makes the bold decision to close all 21 bridges into Manhattan until the two criminals are caught. With a time limit of 5.00am to catch the bad guys before the bridges are reopened. Racing against the clock Andre teams up with Frankie Burns (Sienna Miller) but begins to get the unsettling feeling that not all is what it seems. Sure the plot basically writes itself yet the result is the kinda movie you can lose yourself in for a little under two hours.An entertaining popcorn flick for all you cinema goers looking for your weekly action movie. Delivers exactly what you expect, nothing more, nothing less and recommended if you\u2019ve nothing better to do."

      "text": "21 Bridges: a review by James H RobyAt a time when a stark divide exists between the police and the African American community, it might be a little risky releasing a motion picture containing those two populations. But when the picture is helmed by producers and an actor of literal super heroic proportions, I\u2019d say it\u2019s an even bet. 21 Bridges starring the hero, Chadwick Boseman (Black Panther), and produced by the Russo Brothers (Avengers: Endgame) is a thrill ride we haven\u2019t seen the likes of in a while. Boseman\u2019s character, Andre Davis, is a second generation NYC policeman with unquestionable ethics but, well, slightly more questionable methods. He\u2019s got eight shootings under his belt in ten years. So when a pair of crooks murder seven cops in a robbery gone wrong, the police puts the cop killer killer on the case. After all, he\u2019s the best man for the job\u2026or is he?There\u2019s a twist of sorts in the movie that\u2019s not terribly deep, still it pushes the plot forward. What should be a simple manhunt quickly devolves into a mystery and Andre won\u2019t let go until he\u2019s found the truth. The movie is fast paced and has the feel of a modern techno-thriller with various elements of the NYPD coming together to track down the killers. There\u2019s also some \u2018required\u2019 moments found in every action movie and Boseman delivers perfectly. There\u2019s one scene featured in the trailers where Andre reminds a white FBI agent to have perfect diction when referring to him as a \u2018trigger\u2019. That\u2019s about as deep as the movie goes into America\u2019s current Black vs Blue dilemma and really that\u2019s enough. Otherwise, Andre Davis is a cop\u2019s cop \u2013 vowing to do anything for his \u2018family\u2019 (the police) and threatening to flood Manhattan with \u2018blue\u2019 to catch his criminals. Boseman is backed up with a great cast of Sienna Miller as Frankie Burns, Andre\u2019s partner for the manhunt and J. K. Simmons as police Captain Matt McKenna, stepping out of his familiar role of the Farmers Insurance man and Spider-Man\u2019s nemesis, J Jonah Jameson. Add to the list Stephan James as Michael Trujillo and Taylor Kitsch as Ray Jackson, the movie\u2019s villains. The relatively short run time of 110 minutes actually works in the movie\u2019s favor as it keeps the picture tight with few wasted scenes. The only faults I felt was the soundtrack didn\u2019t seem to match the onscreen action and the story\u2019s somewhat simple mystery.Here\u2019s hoping Chadwick Boseman will don Andre Davis\u2019 badge after his next appearance as the Black Panther.4.5 out of 5"

Chadwick Boseman stars as the idealistic cop who's charged with solving a cocaine heist that results in 8 murdered cops. To trap the culprits before they can escape Manhattan, he orders all bridges shut down (hence, the title). The plot plays out predictably without any surprises in what should be a twisty tale (any savvy moviegoer will spot the corruption early on). It might be OK if there had been anything original in the direction, but as it is, the action is average and the storytelling is bland."

The action sequences where fine, but nothing new. The plot was fine but nothing new. I\u2019ll even say that the acting was good given the dialogue they had to work with, but there definitely wasn\u2019t any stand out performances.

Rather inspected by inertia, the ending of the film is so classic in the spirits of the worst police American films, with a minimum of gray morality."

      "text": "The Same Old 21 BridgesThe Stream: Not a shred of original plot or story-line in sightThe Big Screen: The action sequences are quite intenseThe Final Bill: The lack of originality dampens the need to pay for the action.\u2013 S2SWe are going to shut down the internet and then fill blog with blue. Wait a minute! That\u2019s not how that line went. Either way, 21 Bridges opened this past weekend and Stream to Big Screen was there for it. 21 Bridges follows Chadwick Boseman as NYPD detective, Andre Davis, while he tracks down a couple of cop killers. During his midnight Manhattan manhunt, and after completely locking down the island, he begins to realize that he is in the middle of what could be a bigger issue than expected. Check out the trailer for yourself.So, let\u2019s talk about the positive things. This movie is very intense and a has some great action scenes. Those of you who enjoy the John Wick style of shooting/killing, you will enjoy these action sequences. For those of you that love the Mission Impossible Tom Cruise endless sprint scenes, you too will enjoy portions of this movie. That\u2019s all I have.Everything else was not bad, but it was very forgettable. First, the plot of the movie is almost exactly the same as every other cop-figure-out-a-crime within a crime movie. The execution of the story IS NOT BAD. Chadwick does a relatively good job of being a realistic, straight-edge and uncompromising detective. The criminals, Stephan James as Michael and Taylor Kitsch as Ray, also do a pretty good job at being realistic and believable duo; however, the characters themselves are exactly the same tropes we get in all of these movies. There is not a moment in doubt for the viewer, which is quite amazing for an intense movie that lacks any type of suspense. This might sound harsh but this movie is beyond predictable and unoriginal, it is soul-less.Unfortunately, 21 Bridges is not worth going to the theater to view because of the predictable nature and unoriginal plot. Yet, 21 Bridges can be something to watch on an Amazon Prime/Netflix, if you\u2019re bored one day. Better yet, who doesn\u2019t like a shoot\u2019em up cop drama that you don\u2019t have to think about on a boring afternoon. This movie gets a handful of popcorn solely for the intense shootouts."
