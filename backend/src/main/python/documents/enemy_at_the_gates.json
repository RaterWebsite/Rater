But i'm extremely fond of saving private ryan(luv the characters and story) this ones concept, snipers playin cat an mouse is sooo cool but unfortunately, i felt bored, aggitated and quite shockingly resentful towards the film. the climax was lame, the acting wasnt horrible but its just how this ones written that doesnt wanna tick into stylishness. A mere disappointment. I am one of those rare people who actually despise this film beyond recognition. If only we had a different writer for it, such a waste of talent."

I would have liked to have seen it on the big screen, I\u2019m sure it was quite impressive. The music was pretty good; mainly relying on great sweeping themes throughout it did put me in mind of another epic war film set in Russia. All the performances were very good with Jude Law, Rachel Weisz and Ed Harris standing out for me. It was one of those films that was good, with ambitions of being great but never quite getting there. Sadly I felt that the love triangle got in the way, a bit, of a decent war film. I say \u2018sadly\u2019 because I thought Rachel Weisz was particularly good in this one. Over all though, I found it a bit too long but still quit a decent watch.\r SteelMonster\u2019s verdict: RECOMMENDED\r My score: 7.3/10."

      "text": "I had an opportunity to watch Enemy at the Gate last night which I had never seen and found it to be an enjoyable war movie. It was bold and daring to create and an English film totally set in Russia and not to feature any Americans which does give the movie some originality from the bucket loads of American hero themed WW2 movies out there. The gritty visual style, props, and costumes are also very impressive and believable. There are also some good war and battle scenes, some of which have gone on to influence popular shooter video games like Call of Duty. Some of the characters are interesting however the love story becomes silly and feels a little unsuited to the movie, I can see the intention to bring some warmth into the gloom and doom of depressing Russia but it didnt work. Some of the accents also feel out of place but the movies core strength is the cat and mouse hunting of its 2 leads which is entertaining and enjoyable. Not a perfect movie due to its silly mishandled love story but recommended."

Rachel Weisz is a nice surprise to see here, and adds some healthy romantic interest, and the rest of the lead cast puts forth good performances. The most interesting part of the movie is the story it's based on and the dueling scenes, beyond that you can expect some fairly standard war film fodder. Certainly not a bad movie by any means, so check it out if you're a war buff."

Jean-Jacques Annaud nous fait donc profiter d'une reconstitution soign\u00e9e -bien que s\u00e9v\u00e8rement romanc\u00e9e, un peu trop m\u00eame- de la bataille d\u00e9cisive. Le plus \u00e9tonnant est le r\u00f4le important accord\u00e9 \u00e0 Khrouchtchev, commissaire politique d\u00e9di\u00e9 et grand motivateur de troupes mais don't act...Il est camp\u00e9 par un Bob Hoskins tant\u00f4t enrag\u00e9, tant\u00f4t mena\u00e7ant \u00e0 souhait et tout-\u00e0-fait raccord avec les m\u00e9thodes sovi\u00e9tiques employ\u00e9es lors du conflit : loin de glorifier le Soviet Supr\u00eame et sa clique, le film nous montre \u00e0 la fois le d\u00e9nuement de l'Arm\u00e9e Rouge et le comportement abominable de ses grad\u00e9s qui tirent sur leurs propres hommes, enfin je veux dire ceux qui reculent, c'est-\u00e0-dire \"les tra\u00eetres \u00e0 la patrie\"...Du c\u00f4t\u00e9 nazi, tout n'est pas tr\u00e8s rose non plus avec l'histoire du gamin... mais au cas o\u00f9 vous n'auriez pa saisi, Stalingrad n'\u00e9tait pas une colonie de vacances, dans un camp comme dans l'autre... En tout cas, Ed Harris est excellent dans le r\u00f4le du sniper ennemi et d'une sobri\u00e9t\u00e9, d'une neutralit\u00e9 exemplaires.Jude Law dans le r\u00f4le du h\u00e9ros sovi\u00e9tique \u00e0 l'insu de son ignorance ne s'en tire pas trop mal mais ne s'av\u00e8re jamais r\u00e9ellement \u00e0 la hauteur de sa t\u00e2che : quant \u00e0 Rachel, elle est h\u00e9las un peu trop servie comme \"repos du guerrier\" et pas grand-chose de plus...  Joseph Fiennes est heureusement excellent d'intensit\u00e9, d\u00e9vou\u00e9 \u00e0 la cause et presque aussi cingl\u00e9 que ce bon vieux Nikita...En outre, la fin un peu trop hollywoodienne loupe le coche, car le film de JJ Annaud est globalement assez dur (avec quelques notes de psychodrame, certes) et gagnait jusque l\u00e0 sur les tableaux du r\u00e9alisme et de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9.Rien de grave cependant, car ce Stalingrad r\u00e9ussit \u00e0 atteindre et maintenir un bel \u00e9quilibre entre le grand spectacle, sa mise en sc\u00e8ne rigoureuse et la romance ainsi que quelques moments forts. Le manich\u00e9isme est finalement assez r\u00e9duit et on doit sans doute au r\u00e9alisateur fran\u00e7ais de ne pas en avoir rajout\u00e9 (sauf \u00e9ventuellement dans le psychodrame...).Il n'en a pas moins fait prendre conscience au spectateur via ce duel \u00e0 distance de la duret\u00e9 de la guerre, ce qui n'est certes pas toujours le cas dans le genre tr\u00e8s fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 des films de guerre : on en ressort ici \u00e9mu, pr\u00eat \u00e0 chanter l'hymne non pas de l'affreux camarade moustachu mais celui de la Russie \u00e9ternelle invaincue (et nous autres, Fran\u00e7ais, en savons quelque chose !)."

      "text": "Movie war / drama / romance, all in one.This film portrays the Battle of Stalingrad, considered by many the turning point of World War II, as it was the first crushing defeat of the Germans. The film focuses its history in Vassili Zeitzev, a soviet sniper who caused many headaches to the Nazis, killing his officers on the ground, something that was used by the communist propaganda machine to encourage the morale of Russian troops, worn by unstoppable advance of the Nazis. In this film, the story of Zeitzev intersects with Tania, a Russian girl who volunteered to help the forces defending Stalingrad, giving birth to a romantic plot that intersects the main one. Directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud (who also wrote the screenplay with Alain Godard), the film has Jude Law and Rachel Weisz in the lead roles and also features Joseph Fiennes in the role of a political commissar, Bob Hoskins, embodying the Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev, and Ed Harris in the role of a German professional sniper sent by Hitler to kill Vassili.The wartime love is a theme that has made great films. One of the most notable was obviously \"Casablanca\". This film, however, takes place not only in wartime but in the midst of one of the most raw and bloody battles of the war, which makes it more interesting as it is not just a romance or a drama, nor a \"conventional\" war film. It's a bit of all three genres combined. The sound effects, soundtrack, visual effects, sets and costumes are noteworthy for their realism and attempt to portray the combat scenario. The actors were also very good, especially Ed Harris (who has got used to doing tough-guy roles) and Weisz (finally a movie without mummies and Egyptian stuff). Jude Law and Fiennes, together, deserve a special greeting as they were able to incorporate very well the emotional and psychological conflicts of his characters, two friends in love with the same girl.As more negative marks, I point out the lack of \"chemistry\" between Weisz and Law, which should have been more crafted by two actors. Some dialogue required a greater commitment on the part of writers. Also I don't understand how Khrushchev was involved in that battle when, in reality, it was led by Georgi Zhukov. A good war movie, worth seeing because it will please both those looking for action as for those who enjoy a good drama."

Virtually the most bloody battle of WW2, even now, after 60 years from the battle, the scars of war still remain in the citizen of it.Thanks to the Russian propaganda, the Germans called their best sharpshooter, Major Konig, especially to kill Zaitsev. In the middle of the film, becames evident that the battle is not only in the city, but there's a fierce internal battle between Zaitsev and his fella Danilov (Fiennes), that have a special feeling for Tania (Weisz) and in a major moment starts to write lies about Zaitsev, and in the final sacrifices his own life to reveal the position of the german sniper, so Vassili can finnaly kill him. It is a interesting film that opens the people's eyes to they see how bad, bloody and terrible a war can be.You feel a little suspense during the film, because you don't know where can a soldier be and shoot you to death."
