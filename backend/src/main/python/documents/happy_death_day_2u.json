Nevertheless, this one surprised me in some ways. For one, it wasn't really a slasher like the first one was, rather it introduced sci-fi and multiverse elements to it, which I thought felt somewhat interesting, but also ridiculous at times. Some of the acting and dialogue from certain characters was also cringeworthy. However, I will say that the acting from lead actress Jessica Rothe was once again pretty solid, and there were a surprising amount of deep, meaningful, and emotional scenes with her character that helped keep the film investing at times. But overall, despite the handful of meaningful and decent moments, rather than building upon what the first film offered, it seemed to just jumble a bunch of genres together horror/slasher, sci-fi, comedy, etc.) with no clear aim if you ask me."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "The biggest mistake in this film. Making it an attempt to explain something that has never been asked 'why'. The first film works effectively with its ambiguity. No explanation needed. But if you want to explain, then do it really clearly. This second film has a scientific foundation to include all events, only that the foundation is built weakly so it raises many other questions. In the end the film told us to swallow the question completely. We are told to just follow, just believe, in the event that they are arranged as a storyline, there is no need to think of other alternatives. The irony is actually for a story about the multiverse and diverse human choices. Aside from all that, the film still retains the charm that made its first film liked and the aspects that made it exist; Jessica Rothe's sense of humor and appearance. So this film will work best if watched by a marathon immediately after the first film."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "When thinking about the comedy-horror genre, there are very few and far in-between films that come to mind. While it may be hard to conjure up a large number of films which remain memorable for quality and not for overall lewdness, gross out gags are born and raised in these types of films. While more often than not, many of the films born in this genre have made, for the most part, a mockery of the genre, thankfully there are a few gems to carry the cultish torch; gems like Sam Raimi\u2019s Evil Dead, Mel Brooks\u2019 Young Frankenstein, or Edgar Wright\u2019s Shaun of The Dead and Scary Movie from the lively Keenen Ivory Wayans remain some of the few films that come to mind right away. All notable and truly brilliant contributions to the genre, these films possess the impressive ability to walk the proverbial tightrope between the equally difficult threshold of outlandish yet effective comedy and frightening and truly terrifying horror. The natural benefit of combining the two is that both commonly rely on similar mechanics for the pay off or climax of scenes. The pacing is similar; you find the same tension that gets built up for a laugh but could easily shift gears and become build up for a gasp, and for both respectable genres, it\u2019s all about the revealing of what we the audience have been waiting for, the killer behind the shower curtain or the perfectly timed punchline.Happy Death Day 2U is directed by Christopher Landon, a filmmaker who jumped in on the train that was Paranormal Activity after the massive success of the first indie surprise hit. Yet, as devoted Landon is to the genre itself, directing and writing many entries in the comedy-horror subgenre, including 2015\u2019s Scouts Guide to The Zombie Apocalypse, Death Day 2U is a fresh and invigorating take on genre but also on romance, mortality and even includes a dash of science fiction. The brilliant, even outstanding advantage Death Day 2U has over films before it of its kind is its show stopping leading lady who is larger than the film itself Jessica Rothe. Death Day 2U is a sequel and we see Jessica reprising her role as Tree Gelbman, the time looped slasher victim of all slasher victims from the first film. This time around she gets caught in the Groundhog Day/Halloween type scenario once again. Let me just say that Rothe plays the role like an ace; funny, down to earth, beautiful and well-timed as a comic, she also crowns herself a worthy scream-queen next some greats.  While the film uses the reviving or reincarnating premise to the fifth degree unabashedly, luckily for the audience, it never feels tiresome; the cinematic gimmick stays fresh. The main plot device is primarily governed by the films main comedic power Phi Vu playing the character of Ryan Lin, a friend of Tree\u2019s who ends up getting stuck in the same \u201cloop\u201d or dimension that Tree was stuck in. With this new dilemma and multiple dimensions in the film, it never feels boring or clich\u00e9. One of the dimensions has Tree\u2019s recently deceased mother alive and well, along with her boyfriend Carter Davis played by Israel Broussard dating Tree\u2019s arch enemy from the original first dimension the film started in, these scenes provided surprising and truly moving emotional weight to the film, giving insight to relationships and life overall. I can honestly say that I was completely thrown off by the films ability to include so many different scenarios and ways for Tree to be murdered with some truly hilarious scenes. Yet all at the same time hold any kind of weight emotionally, the side plot involving her mother being alive is truly heartbreaking to see and did not feel melodramatic or forced. All of the side characters in the film held there weight and served there desired purpose and honestly the entire film is simply good fun. Popular culture references are present and the riffing on Inception and other dimension based works brought belly laughs out of the audience. The horror aspect of the film was designed with what I believe to be simplicity in mind, simple side plots including an affair between a young Nurse who is a friend of Tree\u2019s and a doctor set stage for some awesome suspense sequences. The killer possess zero qualities other than mild athleticism and a brilliantly designed school mascot mask that he dons as he attempts to satisfy his blood thirst, paired with a Michael Myers style kitchen knife as his weapon of choice. The mask is perfect and Landon does a good job at offsetting the usual jump out and scare tactics to actually be effective and a hell of a fun ride. Happy Death Day 2U is a destined to fail concept, with so many genres and feelings thrown into one mix, it takes quite the perfect storm to turn said mix into a good Manhattan, and let me tell you, Christopher Landon was the perfect bartender for this party."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "This movie started so well, it was so promising and suddenly it turn from light slasher movie into comedy/teenage drama/slasher movie. This transition changed the movie's dynamic. First - something brave,original and funny turn into boring, confusing, multiverse time-travel movie. Why, oh why they ruined their own franchise. Out of all possible scenarios they chose to run with the time-machine plot line interjected with family/boyfriend drama which just dragged for far too long. This was so unnecessary, so forced onto the viewer. Movie itself was a collection of sometimes idiotic deaths and the feeling of dread and mystery totally evaporated from the movie. I was really hoping for the better, bigger, bolder sequel and I got light s-f comedy instead. I know that the first movie had this funny vibe but it was leaning more towards slasher than comedy and here the scales tipped more on the comedy side.

For those of you who haven't seen the first Happy Death Day, college student Tree Gelbman (Jessica Rothe) must relive the same day over and over, getting murdered by someone in a baby face mask until she figures out who the murderer is. A movie so bad it's good and so good it made over twenty times its budget, not only have we gotten a sequel but there's a strong possibility of a third movie thus completing the trilogy. Happy Death Day 2U sees the return of Tree and if she thought dying over and over again was bad things just get a whole lot worse for poor Tree as she's faced with some rather surprising moral dilemmas with dangerous consequences.I really don't believe Happy Death Day needed a sequel, especially a sequel that honestly doesn't know what genre it wants to be anymore. I don't remember anyone asking for an explanation to the time loops but Happy Death Day 2U decides to give one anyway in the form of some really smart college students creating a molecular quantum glowy ball thing that isn't really doing what it's supposed to do but is definitely doing something freaky because why not? Why wouldn't the time loops be created like this, Happy Death Day 2U\u00a0makes the decision to just hop into a whole other genre. The first one is very much rooted in horror but this was all over the place. I felt it was a mess, story wise it just wasn't working for me and it only got worse, by the end it felt like a soap it was that overly dramatic. Despite this and the truly awful script, it's got more than a few laugh out loud moments, possibly for all the wrong reasons but that doesn't really matter if it's still making you laugh. And I did laugh, numerous times at just how daft this film is. Particularly Jessica Rothe who honestly plays this part so well, alongside a whole group of mediocre actors her performance stands out even more for an hour and a half and considering so many horror/comedies fail at this I have to give it some kudos because I have seen much worse. It's a bad movie that will entertain you. The first one is a better film and I stand by my earlier comment, there was no need for a sequel but something's gotta pay the bills, recommended for fans of Happy Death Day."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Great summer movie (but in winter) funny, light and doesn't take itself seriously. haven't seen a movie like this for a long time. it's like It's 90th again, in a good way. people like me from the 90th will really appreciate this movie, Shame that there are very limiter movies like this one out there."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Happy Death Day 2U is such an interesting follow up to the original Happy Death Day. In some regards, it improves vastly on the premise of the original film. Shifting the genre from horror/comedy to sci-fi/comedy is such an incredibly strong writing choice that only elevates the movie. There are some excellent character developments and world expansions in the script, and the script itself is quite witty. There are thought provoking parallels to absurdism, and without giving too much away, even the title of this movie, Happy Death Day 2U is a cleverly disguised plot reveal.Jessica Rothe triumphantly returns to the character of Tree Gelbard, and she's only gotten better since the first movie. The whole rest of the cast also reprises their roles, and you can tell there was a lot of passion that went into making this sequel. For the most part, the passion pays off. Where Happy Death Day 2U falls short is in its technical execution and meandering second third of the movie.Very noticeably, it seems like the production quality of HDD2U has dropped considerably. The lighting isn't as good. The CGI is more noticeable, the fake CGI blood just looks bad and is somewhat over indulgent. The camera work is cookie-cutter and uninteresting. The score is just noise. As far as the storytelling, about halfway through the second act, and halfway through the third act, up until right before the climax, nothing happens. You can skip this entire 20 minutes of screen time and not miss anything.

The first film was a lot of fun with some good humorous moments and horror. We were left with the only question of what caused her to relive the same day over and over again. It wasn\u2019t something that needed to be explained but sometimes to get an explanation. So with that comes the sequel. I was looking forward to this and had high hopes for it to be as refreshing and fun as the first. What we got was something like that but not quite as good. That\u2019s not to say the film is disapointing because it\u2019s not. It is still fun with plenty of funny moments that really gave me some good belly laughs. This is not so much a horror movie anymore. This is a sci-fi film with a time travel edge. I give the filmmakers serious props with how well they matched up scenes from the first film perfectily here and made everything feel seamless beginning to end. This time around, Carter\u2019s roommate Ryan is given more to do. We find out he and friends have made a quantum reactor that is fact causing these time loops. THe beginning provides a bit of a shocker with Ryan being chased by another version of himself. This leads to him activating the device and with it, Tree wakes up back in the same day as the first film but something is different. Carter is now dating Danielle, Tree\u2019s sorority sister, and her mother is alive. Jessica Rothe\u2019s scenes with her mother, played by Missy Yager, are very emotional scenes. I actually felt emotion in this scene and in a movie like this, that\u2019s not quite what you would expect but it\u2019s a good thing. One of the biggest disapointments though is the trailer was very misleading. It made it sound like everyone was going to be a vicitim of the killer and that is not the case. Also, the film kind of igonores one of it\u2019s rules only until he needs to use it again at the end. Tree needs to keep killing herself to get equations to help get her back home, but a problem in the first was her keep dying was affecting her body and it actually killing her. So, why does this not seem to be an issue here? Well, it is at the end when it finally starts affecting her but it feels like it\u2019s only being now brought up to benefit the plot. Also, I feel like some plot holes exists that the ending should have addressed, especially with Ryan number two. Now don\u2019t let my complaints fool you, this is still a fun sequel. It does a lot of things good too with some interesting plot twists with the alternate timeline and more characters that are great additions to the film. The first film is better, no question about it, but this is a worthy sequel that continues plot lines with some twists and intruging angle towards a third installment.Grade: C+"}, {"rating": "4", "text": "I wasn\u2019t expecting to feel so negative about this film.

They didn't. Instead of focusing on a new set of characters and possibly an even more intriguing death-defying situation that includes the Groundhog Day spin, they instead take the original cast and continually grasp at straws for each minute that passes over-explaining the story in an attempt to justify the film's existence, while at the same time doing whatever it takes to, as it seems throughout, fill-up the movie's runtime to an acceptable length.  This second entry once again sees the protagonist wake up on the dreaded day she's supposed to die, but this time she's stuck in a parallel universe due to a science experiment gone wrong. What unfolds from this is a story that's as lame as it sounds and it never even gives the viewer a reason to care at all who exactly \"the killer\" is because, after all, it's essentially a dream world she's stuck in. This time around, there's even more emphasis on getting things back to normal than discovering who's behind the mask. None of it makes sense. Every joke falls flat.

I was looking forward to this sequel, but I became a little apprehensive when I found out that this was going the Back to the Future 2 route and revisit the same day. The entire first film had been lead Tree Gelbman (played by the wonderful Jessica Rothe) reliving the same day over and over. I get that the movie was probably going to go at events from a different angle, but I was worried about them things and it seemed a little cheap getting Tree back into the exact same time loop after fighting so hard to free herself. But my worries were unnecessary, this wasn't a time loop movie, but a time loop that takes place in an alternate reality movie, which was different enough for me to work. In fact, this was a lot of fun and almost as good as the first one.Happy Death Day 2U shakes things up in three ways to keep things fresh. 1) It shifts the feel of the first movie from a horror comedy to more of a comedy-comedy. There are a lot less killer attacks. (There are a couple well shot scares for what there are.) The movie's soundtrack has noticeabley changed from horror to comedy. The whole thing's pretty amusing. They have more fun as deaths get even more ludicrous from the first. A funny joke you may have seen in the trailer turns out to be better in full.2) It finally explains what caused the time loop and gets all science-fictiony.3) The aforementioned alternate reality. After a rather interesting fifteen minute or so opener that I won't spoil, Tree winds up in a new timeline where events are mostly the same, so we don't need to waste time having with a lot of new exposition, but there are small but important differences scattered throughout. Tree finds herself going up against a new killer, and the film's strength is built upon twisting expectations.I liked that this managed to bring back all the main cast from the first. (Not to mention a lot of bit roles.) They're all likable. Still, the movie once againn rests on Tree's shoulders. Considering that the first film was all her reaching an emotional arc, you'd think they wouldn't have many more emotional places to take her, but it does. Tree has a big thing happen to her and she has to make a serious decision. Jessica Rothe makes this movie, whether being funny or sad. To be honest the basic plot is a little thin if you look back at the script intellectually. It is Rothe's charisma that guides the whole thing.Keep through the credits. There is a scene in the middle you shouldn't miss.

In every scene that she\u2019s in you can easily tell she\u2019s having fun with the role and giving it her all. She could easily switch from being funny in one scene too serious the next. Everybody else in this movie was good just not great. Now the relationship in this movie is kind of unbelievable like Disney level unbelievable. I mean Tree and Carter had really only been dating for what two to eleven days. I\u2019m sorry but like I said that only happens in Disney movies where the girl falls in love with the guy the moment she meets him and automatically wants to marry him. This film is a horror comedy and in the horror section it\u2019s a tiny bit above average but in the comedy department, it was really funny. If you guys have seen the trailer you know that Tree has to kill herself in many different and creative ways and all of them were kinda funny to me at least. Even some of the scenes that others will probably find cringey I found kind of funny because they were cringy. But again I\u2019m a teenager who reviews movies what do you expect. Now the horror element of the film comes and goes throughout the entire thing and is really put on hold for the comedy of the film.

It is not too more of the same and tries to build upon what we saw before, but also could have been fresher and not tried too hard in the story execution. It is not amateurish, is appealingly played and has enough amusement and atmosphere, at the same time it is not near as focused as the previous film.Will start with the good. The photography is stylish rather than slapdash, the editing has suitably unnerving moments and the lighting is atmospheric. Christopher Landon never lets it get too heavy while not diluting the fun or scares, and the at times haunting and at others times funky soundtrack adds a lot.There is a lot of humour, more so than scares actually, and again generally it's knowing and firmly tongue in cheek. There could have been more scares and suspense but when they were there there was some creepiness, or so to me. The acting is solid, but Jessica Rothe is great and one of the main reasons to see 'Happy Death Day 2 U'. The character chemistry is appealing and not forced.As aforementioned however, although seldom dull the story was much more focused before and slicker. The second half especially, thought the film started off great actually and held my attention, tries to do too much and can get over-complicated. The time dimensions stuff, focused on a little too heavily, could have had more clarity. Neither the comedy or horror feel as fresh. Some staleness in some of the gags and as said the scares and suspense are not enough.Despite the solid acting, the character writing is superficial. It was in the previous film too but before it felt more self-aware and acknowledgable of that, didn't get as much of that sense here. 'Happy Death Day 2 U' does get increasingly silly in the plotting on top of lack of sense and logic towards the killer reveal. Once again the killer reveal underwhelms, hugely underdeveloped, rushed and confusingly head-scratching.In conclusion, enjoyed the first but this sequel left me conflicted. 5/10"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "\u0421\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u043f\u043e\u0448\u043b\u043e \u043b\u0438 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c\u0443 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u0443 \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u043d\u0435\u0442, \u043d\u043e \u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0443\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0441\u044e\u0434\u0430 - \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0430\u0442\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c!"}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Not really a good movie.
