      "text": "A film that I considered my all-time favourite for years (which may be a little out-dated now) it has the stunning, British-representing main cast of Zeta-Jones and Connery. Their on-screen chemistry is not the most fantastic ever but in the context of the film it works well, the sort of hard-to-get to-and-fro play-by-play. I think the films story is great, a film does not have to contain explosions every few minutes to keep my attention, especially if it is one like Entrapment, that has a crime thriller element. In all, a well rounded movie, it has its downfalls but so does every other. Still enjoyable over 10 years on."

They are still the tallest twin towers in the world."

      "text": "Some of the information in Mac's file includes D.O.B. (August 21, 1937); P.O.B. (Edinburgh, Scotland); Citizen (U.K.); Height (6'3\"); Weight (210 lbs.); Race (Caucasian); Hair (Brown - graying); Eyes (Brown). This is almost identical to Connery, with the only differences being D.O.B (August 25, 1930) and Height (6'2\"). Mac's file also states; family (Age 5 - father died, age 12 - mother died, no known siblings); Marital Status (Widowed 1955, Camilla Charles); Languages Spoken (English, Mandarin, Japanese, French, Malay); and Military Service (Royal Marines 1956-1962, Commando Unit, Malaysian police). This is very similar to the character of James Bond. Family (Age 11 - both parents died, no siblings); Marital Status (Widowed in the book \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\"); Degree in Oriental Languages, fluent in French; Military Service (Commander in the Royal Navy)."

      "text": "In this film, an employee of an insurance company will seek to investigate and arrest a professional art thief without anyone knowing, however, that she's also a professional thief. The game of cat and mouse is very nice and gives this movie the pleasant adventure flavor, especially when we combine this with the sequences of the robberies, some of them so incredible that they stink the false (without this bothering us too much). Another nice point that helps keep the interest in the movie is the relative vagueness in which the movie keeps Gin's situation. Only in the end did we clearly see if she is a thief or invented all that to approach Mac and arrest him. In addition, the pair crosses with other dubious characters, whose connections also only clarify in the end.In spite of all this, its not a particularly deep film and doesn't have a very strong or solid story giving it basis. These basis is the action scenes and adventure/mystery atmosphere, and its around this that the script is developed, not the other way round. The film still has some romance but chemistry between Connery and Zeta Jones is virtually nil and romantic scenes aren't convincing. This doesn't bring any demerit to their sex-appeal, but there are some things that sound false and I think the mood of distrust was fundamental to discarding this attempt to do romance. The remaining cast is limited to what they have to do. The two main actors, combined, support the film successfully. So the end result is a good action/adventure film, with some mystery, charm and elegance, where the biggest absence is a solid story that builds on everything we're seeing on screen."
