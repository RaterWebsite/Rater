      "text": "Chemical Hearts is not that clich\u00e9 teen film, it is much more than that. It addresses subjects that are often difficult to have in youth films. It shows the reality, it conveys the message that not everything is perfect, that we cannot change anyone, however much we love them. It shows insecurity, fear, love, the difficulties of being young. I absolutely loved the movie. Lili Reinhart performed perfectly well I was absolutely speechless!"
