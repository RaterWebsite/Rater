What it does do well is creepiness.\rThe first time I watched it I was pretty underwhelmed. It was one of, possibly the only Kubrick film I'd seen that didn't deliver on my expectations. Often a Kubrick film will go above and beyond my expectations. However the more I thought about it, and after watching it a second time, and watching the documentary Room 237. My thoughts on the film have become much more positive and enthusiastic. In a lot of aspects this is some of Kubrick's best work ever. The carefully thought out shots. The way he creates such isolation and hostility for the viewer. You're off in your own world in the Overlook Hotel. Jack Nicholson is fantastic in it. The music in it is very good and effective to adding a whole extra level to the movie. And it'd have to be the most mysterious Kubrick film ever made. Even more than 2001. There are so many questions you'll be asking about this film. The ending won't solve all your questions; it'll add more. You could interpret this movie from so many angles. If you become intrigued in this film even after you watch it, go on the internet and look at the various interpretations and things the film had that you probably missed. This film still remains a mystery three decades on, it's not a total crowd pleasing film but if you're interesting it's definitely worth a watch."

It follows  Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) who is staying in an old, empty hotel with his family and begins to go mad. The events in this film spin into the strange and scary. It has many scary moments and it is very creepy. It also boasts excellent acting by Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall. It did, however, take a bit of time for the horror to start, and also it was quite long, but it is still great."

I mean it's bland at more than one point in the movie and it seemed like Kubrick was just trying to make a shocking film as opposed to doing Stephen Kings book justice. I have to it credit for how gorgeous it was shot and how well acted it was (beside Shelly Duvalls horrible performance) overall a fun movie to watch with friends to me but nothing special at all."

I hate her running style, its like from some parody, maybe first 30 minutes she was mysterious and interesting, then later she totally lost herself. Jack did awesome work, he laugh and he's angry in same time, change many faces in one scene so we can actually read his mind, which is pretty cool. Kid was pretty awesome too, one of best kid acting i saw lately in horror movies. But, i dnt think this is horror, it's more like drama. There was few really long scenes, that dnt really need to be that long. Anyways, worst thing about movie is music. You cant focus on scene because you need to take off your headphones because music become too loud on some scenes, and music is just random and weird, i really didn't liked that part. Not to mention that black guy traveled a lot to get one hit in chest after he just walked in hotel lobby. Pretty lame, he got involved in story too much, and he didnt had even one line when he arrived at hotel."

Everything is crafted so carefully since the very first minute.2)Acting is fantastic. Although i dislike Shelley Duvalle interpretation Nicholson alone is worth seeing. One of the best performances in the history of cinema.3)It will be scary. And i don't mean cheap jumpscares. I mean the anxiety that haunts you for days after you leave the theater.

Beautifully creepy music throughout and unforgettable performance from Jack Nicholson as the winter caretaker of the Overlook Hotel who loses his mind and finds redemption only in murder using an axe to go after his wife and son, Danny who has the shining ability and talks to some imaginary little helper named Tony but he's very real and warns Danny of danger. Some creepy moments including what Jack Nicholson discovers in the bathtub in room 237 plus the Grady twins and the river of blood gushing from a hotel elevator... Beautifully directed with sometimes amazing scenery especially from the start. The Shining has suspense and horror wrapped in a beautiful red bow and it delivers like no other horror movie has managed to do. Directed by Stanley Kubrick in 1980, The Shining delivers!"

To be honest, this movie is the reason I love Stephen Kings books and movies, it set the stage. The main reason that I like the movie is that its a horror movie but its not like a generic slasher flick that depends on the gore and violence, its not like that. Its an extremely imaginative movie that is based off of psychological horror, there's a lot of psychedelia in this movie, I'm not going to lie to you. It will put your mind to the test, it makes you think, how many movies can do that in such a beautiful way. The tone of the movie scares me, its a truly memorable film.

I now consider this a total failure of my youth. The Shining is my favorite of Kubrick's movies - and it ages incredibly well (unlike perhaps 2001 where the startling special effects are no longer so startling 50 years later). I'm not sure this is a horror movie, what I am sure of is that it is one of the greatest movies of all time. Brilliant. Kubrick is peerless amongst directors."

There are numerous hints about what's to come from quite early on and it has a somewhat slow plot but I'd say that works in its favour, for this film certainly as it leaves the viewer trying to second guess when things may suddenly 'come to a head', as it were.Its certainly not an utter gorefest throughout, as horror films go but as you may have guessed, it is very tense at times and I really liked the way the wide-angle camera (pan) shots and the music (quite old fashioned, spooky music certainly, often featuring strings (stringed instruments - it has a Hitchcockian feel to it)) go well together. The cast does a good job, certainly Jack Nicholson as John Torrance and Shelley Duvall as his wife, Wendy. I can understand why this is regarded as a classic horror film, with both of their performances being quite memorable. Wendy's look of sheer terror when things come to a head is quite chilling and certainly memorable, as is Jack's when he embarks on the infamous rampage.If your a fan of horror films and the like, then I'd definitely recommend this film."

Granted, Nicholson was great, as always, and Kubrick's direction - Though he's done much better - Is acceptable, outside of the casting of Shelley Duvall.  Actually, it is she that is the major problem with this movie, and the kid who played the kid doesn't help any.  Discounting those items, it's got a good feel to it, and creates a creepy atmosphere.  It's got a great music score, and excellent photography, but the script deviates too far from the book.  With Nicholson as the star, and Kubrick as the director of a Stephen King story, I expected much, MUCH more."

I really dont know why the critics give this masterpiece a 6.1, but thats out sh*tty generation, good movies are given bad reviews, and bad movies are given good reviews, thats just sad. To all people who gave this a good review, you have great taste, to all people who gave it a bad one, suck it!"

      "text": "\"The Shining\" is an unfortunate missed opportunity. Stanley Kubrick's adaptation squanders its source material, sacrificing the complex characterisation, themes and nuance that made Stephen King's novel so distinctive and compelling. Given the sheer brilliance of what it had to work with, and the immense talent attached to it, the film should have turned out to be far more than what it was: a disappointingly basic and stunted \"chiller\" does not do any semblance of justice to King's masterpiece. It lacks any form of suspense, thrills or chills, manages only to be slightly and sporadically unnerving. \"Here's Johnny\" and \"Room 237\" are memorable vignettes. But the film as a whole is forgettable. I will concede Jack Nicholson is excellent - the role of Jack Torrance is a perfect showcase for his talents. But even he cannot override the film's waste of potential."

      "text": "An atmospheric, slow-burning horror film that charts a man's descent into madness. Though the directing and writing is top notch, Nicholson is the real star of the show. His character is fantastically deranged and believable and is the commanding force in each scene he is in. Although not terrifying, the movie effectively builds tension and suspense culminating in a dramatic third act."
