It is really hard to imagine that this came from the same creative mind as Avatar. It's so cheesy, such wooden acting and stilted dialogue. Best unintentionally funny line - \"I'm not wearing the wet suit of a dead person!\" So there. Maybe if you could actually care about the characters it could have generated some emotional involvement. Only saving grace, some native folks got paid for working on this abysmal production."

Tight squeezes and narrow escapes are tense enough, but it's the spectacular scenery and stunning cinematography that make this a standout (the non-optional 3D doesn't really add much). The only downside is the dreadful drama that clogs the pacing. Otherwise, the visuals and effects are remarkable."

If it takes them ten years to explore it, still nobody cares. The death of the first diver is announced twenty minutes before it is actually happening. Since the rest of the script is not much better, this small flaw fits right in. By the way, a storm or cyclone does not surprise anyone for the last I would say 25 years. Satellites can track these things pretty accurately - how believable is it that a well-equipped expedition does not seem to have access to local weather data, and is actually surprised by a major cyclone ? All the drama never seems real, because it isn't: it is caused by the utter stupidity of these so-called professionals. All the yelling and screaming makes things seem even more out of control, but do not add an ounce to the quality of this flick. The name James Cameron appears in the opening title credits...hard to believe !"

The film is cheesy and the as we go deeper into the cave, every area is dull, looking exactly the same and lavished with unnecessary CGI, something I am not a fan of as a film buff. However, scenes that involve the spectacular 3-D effects make this one of the only reasons to see this movie. In sum, good 3d, mediocre film."

      "text": "Mother Nature is the monster. No aliens here, just a lot of rain, water made malicious by the forces of the cosmos, and then, gravity. Besides, what would aliens be doing in a cave system anyway? It's a question that Neal Marshall's \"The Descent\" never answers. Think about it. These extra-terrestrials travel all those miles, galaxies upon galaxies, to conquer...caves. Why caves? Now here comes \"Sanctum\". In the case of the diver team spelunking around the Papua New Guinea subterranean passageways of Esa Ala, a griping teenaged boy's cry of \"Why caves?\" to his explorer father gets a full explanation, but alas, Josh(Rhys Wakefield) must have a short memory, since he forgets the musings put forth by the expedition team's bank roller, prior to the hierarchical killings. (Naturally, the indigenous crew member dies first.) Carl(Ioan Grufudd) tries to justify his father's unconventional life, which took him away from home in long stretches. He says, \"Your old man is like Christopher Columbus, or Neal Armstrong,\" later adding that \"there's nowhere else on the planet left to explore.\" Apparently, these great men, these iconoclasts of history, make no impression on Josh. (Does he even know who these men are?\") With their lives hanging in the balance, the historically-challenged boy unloads all of his daddy issues on Frank(Richard Roxburgh) at the most inopportune time, whining like an overgrown baby about his father's chronic absenteeism, when his main concern should involve staving off imminent death from the infiltrating water that threatens to turn the caverns into watery graves. Such is the fallacy of the filmic world, where time compression creates a juxtaposition encompassing personal matters with the visceral physicalities of the moment, the latter which should have everybody's full attention, but doesn't, in which the secondary goal of reconciliation is poised to overtake the primary goal of survival. Fighting off mental and physical exhaustion, Frank, in response to his son's bad parenting diatribe, gets his metaphors mixed up, by comparing the cave to a church, and the cave system to religion, when in fact, caverns such as the Esa Ala, and others of its ilk, which took the veteran explorer away from his wife and child over the years, seems more like a mistress, and his penetration of her stone walls, an affair. Frank's church is like something out of the Flannery O'Connor novel \"Wise Blood\", because it's a \"Church Without Christ\". \"No god down here. We're just bits of dust passing through,\" says Frank(an Aussie Hazel Moates) to his only parishioner, \"The Son Who Grew Up Without A Father\", in between the deaths of their fellow divers, George(due to decompression sickness) and Victoria(on account of her stupidity), whom neither father nor son properly mourns like real people would. As a leader of men, Frank sucks. Despite his reputation of being a great man, Frank puts his whole crew in mortal danger right from the start, when he wrongly predicts that the machines will warn its monitoring subordinates of any oncoming flooding. The shouting obscures his incompetence. Frank's in charge, not his underlings, and yet he allows Judes(Allison Cratchley) to dive without a backup tank. It's Frank's job to neutralize her persistence with some persistence of his own. Following the drowning, Josh criticizes him, and instead of taking it like a man, he implicates his son in the accident, citing how the boy didn't procure those extra tanks like he asked. Even worse, he allows Victoria(Alice Parkinson) to swim without a wet suit. The novice diver(and Carl's girlfriend) insists that she'd rather be \"cold and alive than warm and dead,\" when she refuses to wear Judes' gear. During their post-mortem(following Victoria's where she sacrifices herself for the greater good), Josh call his father a \"heartless bastard\", but after a couple of minutes, they're hugging; they patch things up, right after Frank earnestly compares his passion to a religion, and for some asinine reason, this seems to satisfy Josh. Forgiveness should be doled out incrementally, but \"Sanctum\" treats their reconciliation, as it does everything else, like a plot point, as it marches forward into the abyss of formulaic filmmaking."

      "text": "Note: This is identical to my review of this movie on Rotten Tomatoes. So here it is: This movie was a surprisingly good one. Now I have to say around the first half hour of the film the dialogue is pretty bad. There is a hell lot of swearing and in reality nobody would really curse that much. But after the cheesy half hour ends and the real movie kicks in it's actually pretty decent. The 3D in the film is better than most I should say. Since it's by James Cameron. Now to state my opinion I have to say this movie was better than Avatar for me. The story of Avatar was bad even though I liked the film. But if the dialogue wasn't so cheesy in this film then the story would get perfect marks. Now the characters are sort of one dimensional but as the movie swiftly improves they become more realistic. And that's what makes this film so good. I went to see this last night on my birthday party with three of my mates and they said they really liked the film. Now I liked it a lot too. The reason being is that the start of the film you're probably thinking, \"Oh hurry up already I want to see the action!\", or something like that. And by the end of the film you would be completely satisfied. Because that's exactly what you get. Now I'm not going to spoil anything here but all I'm saying now is that there is one survivor. And I don't know why but I sort of knew that there would a sole survivor so during the film I was thinking, \"Who's going to escape safely?\", and you're probably going to be thinking that as well. So in other words this film is somewhat suspenseful. Now I'm running out of things to say here so here's the rest. Since the movie is in 3D, and the 3D is the best 3D I've seen in ages, the film sort of drags you in with the divers. You feel so claustrophobic during the underwater escape scenes and by the time the movie ends not only the survivor gets a huge breath of fresh air but so do you. You feel so relived and happy for the character by the end of the film so by the end you'll probably be thinking, \"That was worth it!\", and you'll probably never forget it. Another thing I should note that the film actually seems much longer than it actually is. Instead of being one hour and forty five minutes to me it actually seemed like two hours and forty five minutes. So time doesn't actually fly when you're having fun. It slows down a bit. And well that's the reason I had a hell lot of fun with this movie! So to say what's left I have to say the film is beautifully photographed and filmed. The film looks brilliant. It's graphics and effects are just amazing. But that's not really surprising since this is made from the guy who made Avatar right? So to end this review I'm giving this movie an 8/10 for it's brilliant scenery, effects and tension but also for it's cheesy dialogue and slightly cardboard characters. So that's my review for Sanctum 3D and this is Mewtwo465 saying goodbye!"

Good film, waited for the blu-ray so I didn't know what to expect, thought it was going to contain more about the earths crust but then disaster happens. But yeah not a bad film. Not amazing but pleased I bought it as it's a film I will watch again. People say dodgy camera movements but I think they were watching a different film. The reason I gave it a 7 is because it strayed off from the opening story however it kept me entertained so my review score is still ok. Good film!"

      "text": "A visual treat this one, especially in 3-D. Sanctum is a brilliant looker. The movie wants you to be in the cave with them. It works. It makes you feel like you're one of the divers on this expedition. It tries to show you the unpleasant and the pleasantness of underwater cave diving. It works. The script was written by the leader of a cave diving expedition which was the inspiration of Sanctum. James Cameron didn't want a script writer without experience of the subject, neither did Alister Grierson. But the script... Oh dear god! That was terrible. Cliched and rubbish are two words to describe it. The acting worked some of the time, but it just mainly fails. The characters are boring but Ioan Gruffurd's character is the worst. His character, Carl Hurley is just badly sketched. The pacing was too slow. It's only about half the length of Avatar, but it felt much longer than it. When Frank was dying, I had to go to the toilet. I was there for about 2 minutes. When I came back, he was still dying and one minute later he died. If you want to watch the movie, remember to look, not to listen."

George, all bloodied and suffering from an earlier bout with the bends, looks like he has minutes to live. But he must be killed \"mercifully,' which act we are forced to watch as he dies most unwillingly. The tough, sometimes driven father bids his son, who earlier in the film would have gladly murdered the old man, now does so reluctantly. An experience diver panics uncharacteristically.

      "text": "Although  \" Sanctum \" ( 3-D / IMAX ) has lovely scenes of back light divers, and huge blue-light caves, the film's dialogue collapses in the very first sentences, with the audience laughing at all the wrong parts ;A -la \" Catwoman .\"Added to this sloppiness  are a non-stop series of gruesome close up, drawn out, right-in-your-face deaths. The sheer volume and intensity of these moves this film from a simple \"Divers Underwater\" movie  into the \" Rebreather Snuff film \" category. In addition, \"Sanctum\" was filmed it on the cheap. True, the cave set is good,  but, I believe  the  base camp shots within the cave should have used stronger lighting, using a smaller \"f-Stop\" resulting in everything being in sharp focus for better 3-D effect.Finally, if your shooting in 3-D, you use it, redlining its capacities. As an example, In the film, there is a distant shot of someone base jumping off a cliff. In 3-D, Anything like this  should be seen from \"his\" viewpoint; standing on the cliff edge, turning away from his smiling friends, then slowllly tilting down, giving a little jump and falling off into space.Alas, they messed this up too.Despite the dialogue, I was rooting for this film; maybe they could turn it around but, as the body count mounted I realized they'd just lost it. Leaving the theater, I pondered \" why did they made the film\" ? True, it's \" Based On A Real Event\" but so what? Who wants to see this & have it rubbed in their face;  whatever possessed them ? A divers \" Angela's Ashes?\"  - Then Why IMAX? Why 3-D ?Seeing \" The Kings Speech next, that gets great reviews . ."

I have seen them from a distance on multiple occasions and can understand the emotion that was portrayed rather vividly in the world below the surface in Sanctum. If you like wilderness camping and survival you will enjoy and relate to this movie. Although unlikely in most situations, there is a risk involved with any extreme activity and caving definitely fits the potential for extreme activities. Great movie.

The father kept saying \"Help me\" while the son was crying and holding his father in his arms. Instead of trying to make this an emotional scene it was laughable it took 5 minutes for him to do it and the acting was so bad during this scene I just kept yelling at the screen, \"Just do it already!\".

But how deceptive that is. For me, Sanctum turned out to be one of the best films of its genre. Excellent level of tension throughout the film, properly balanced timing and plot. And the main ending of the film, which looks realistic. Yes, in words it looks that he described some film from the first hundred of the best on IMDb in the world ranking. But personally, Sanctum will be remembered for this. Surprisingly, sometimes little-known films, with little-known actors, can give such pleasant emotions."
