      "text": "This film works because the audience are given a group of well rounded characters; many of which are quite likable, which helps. These are then put into a sequence of situations that resolve themselves into a satisfactory conclusion. Of course we are taken on quite a journey before this conclusion and I can see how some may find the plot a little hard to follow. Fortunately I have read the Shakespeare play and even seen it performed and so am familiar with all its twists and turns. I love the way it"

      "text": "I resisted seeing this film for a long time, and to be honest I've no idea why. 10 Things I Hate About You is relatively self-aware for a highschool rom-com, and affectionately pokes fun at some of the genre's most annoying cliches. It also has a wacky comic energy and some hilarious dialogue which is the perfect mix of the bright and verbally dexterous and the very, very crude. There are decent performances across the cast, particularly from the effortlessly natural Julia Stiles and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Heath Ledger as a borderline sociopathic rebel-turned-lover-boy. Allison Janney is also brilliant as the entertainingly filthy school counsellor and aspiring erotica writer. It makes a refreshing change for a teenage comedy film to have a believably-aged cast, though the key players were aged 18-20 when the film was made, at least they weren't in their late twenties or early thirties as they sometimes are in Hollywood highschool films. Where the film pleasingly has its own identity for most its run-time, it does disappointingly sink to the level of every other teenage romantic comedy in its final act. At this point it feels a little like screenwriting pair Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith ran out of interesting ideas and just delivered all the soppy stuff you come to expect from this kind of film. And though Ledger is delivers a good performance, his accent is all over the place, and this is accounted for with some clumsy exposition about his character spending his early life in Australia. It might have been a little less jarring if Ledger stuck to one dialect or the other. Despite a generic ending and a couple of story elements that don't quite work, 10 Things I Hate About You is a smart, fun, heart-warming and hilarious romantic comedy, and this is coming from someone who doesn't really like romantic comedies."

      "text": "This one is a ton of fun. Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles are really good here and the writing is witty and funny throughout. As far as teen comedies go, 10 Things I Hate About You is a very good one due to its fun story, funny moments, and the way it just feels so high school. This film just feels high school, which works well in its favor, because it gives it an authentic feeling. Thanks to the comedy here, some actually quite powerful moments, and just pure enjoyment one can derive from this one, 10 Things I Hate About You is a success. However, it is not without its shortcomings. For one, plausibility of many things that happen here is up for debate. Based on what I know about high school, some of the stuff depicted here won't happen. For one, non-spoiler here, but you can't just decide to go to prom the night of, you have to pay well in advance for that stuff. Little things like that add up and really throw the whole thing into question. However, the characters do feel real, from Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles' mysterious, often rumored about characters to Joseph Gordon-Levitt's whiny little loser. An interesting twist on the Shakespeare play, 10 Things I Hate About You is a fun high school film that should manage to entertain you and get you to laugh numerous times."

      "text": "10 Things I hate about You is a 1999 American comedy film directed by Gil Junger. The main actresses are Julia Stiles as Katharina \u201cKat\u201d Stratford and Luisa Oleynik as Bianca the younger of the Stratford sisters.  The main actors are heath Ledger as Patrick Verona and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Cameron James.  The film was inspired by Shakespeare\u2019s comedy The Taming of the Shrew. The screenwrited hinted at this in the family name of the two protagonists, who are named after William Shakespeare\u2019s hometown Stratford-upon-Avon.The film tells about two sisters, Bianca and Kate, who are very different from each other. In fact while Bianca is very sweet and girly, Kate is determined and rebellious. Their father will only allow Bianca to date boys when her sister Kate goes out with a boy herself. Cameron, a new and nerdy schoolmate, falls in love with Bianca and to go out with her he pays another boy, the tough and mysterious Patrick, to ask Kate out. Will they get engaged in spite of their differences? This film showcases 11 upbeat and lively songs played by bands that are not well known in Italy. The genres are rock and punk. Some actors starring in this movie became famous, like Julia Stiles and  late Heath Ledger. The film is set in the 1990\u2019s and the actors are all good-looking. Especially the male ones who are particularly charming. The best scene of this film is when Bianca gave Joey, a guy she was dating, a punch in the face to avenge both her sister and herself for being such a jerk. Another good scene is when Kate reads out her sonnet in the English Lit. class. Very romantic indeed! The film tells about teenagers and their love life. Its is a good movie to see because it portrays a true-to-life story with some romance and comedy. Although the plot is sometimes a bit granted and cheesy, it is an entertaining movie with a pinch of poetry and some nice gags.It is great for teenagers and \u201cex\u201d teenagers who want to dream on about the foregone high-school days."

      "text": "In the opening scene, there is a group of very feminine women in a girly convertible listening to music. The song was very cutesy and playful but as soon as Kat, one of our main characters, drove up next to them in her rusty old car, the music changed to something more aggressive, giving a careless vibe to Kat. She gives the girls an annoyed look just as the music did. This was a great way to begin the film. It gave us an insight to Kat\u00b4s personality without actually telling us, which they do later on in the film. Kat is called a \u00a8difficult woman\u00a8 that many people fear and stay away from but it was much better to show us instead of telling us directly. Especially in the beginning of the film. The plot of the story was different. I\u00b4ve never seen any films with a storyline as such. Yes, the story was very entertaining and moving, but I wish there was a greater emphasis on Patrick Verona, played by late actor Heath Ledger, truly falling in love with the difficult woman Kat Stratford. When I first watched the film, I thought he was still doing it for the money but it turned out that he accidentally fell in love. I was confused the first few times watching the film but other than that, the film is great! I still question the name of the film though. I\u00b4m not quite sure that was the best title. The script of the film was also great. In my opinion, the best character with the best lines was Cameron James. His crush for Bianca, Kat\u00b4s younger sister, was so pure. He was so sincere with his intentions for Bianca. He truly is the ideal man. This dude literally learned french for Bianca. You can't find anyone like that anymore. He was, as gen z would say, down bad. He knew from the moment he saw Bianca, he liked her. He knew her personality and didn\u00b4t let other people change his mind, despite there being many rumors about her. He was indeed right about her. There's always that \u00a8good guys never get the girl\u00a8 trope, but this film defied that from the very beginning, giving out beloved Cameron a shot for the girl early on in the film. This film is totally worth watching. It is my comfort movie. It's funny, a little weird and has awesome characters. I truly recommend it."
