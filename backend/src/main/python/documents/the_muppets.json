I, however, am a big fan of both the muppets and cheesy musicals, so I LOVED it.  We were smiling and laughing the whole time.  I think this movie is great for kids and adults alike.  We just went last night, and I already want to see it again.  I will definitely be purchasing the DVD.  The plot is fairly similar to the first Muppet Movie, but I found that to be a good thing, because it was as if it was paying homage to it.  The new songs are pretty corny, but fun and enjoyable (and will get stuck in your head), and it was really nice that songs from the Muppet Show were used.  I would highly recommend going to see this movie...especially if you've ever been a muppet fan."

And not 'back' like they were in the late 90s (Muppets from Space), this time it's actually polished, and funny. Really funny.\r If you enjoyed the Muppet Show in your youth, see it."

My worries were put to rest when Kermit the frog appears and the 4th wall breaking jokes began. It is a fun and harmless movie with an interesting ending. It definitely ranks up high in what the Muppets have done. The cameos are great, as well the writing. I hope that this is not the final movie for the Muppets anytime soon."

I was a huge fan of The Muppets when I was younger even though there glory days were over. I used to rent out old tapes of the the Muppet show constantly and I would watch any of The Muppet movies whenever I could. So when I heard The Muppets are coming back and Jason Segal is writing and starring in it I was litterally blown away. If this review seems biased I'm sorry.They'res grat acting all round from both humans and Muppets. the jokes are fresher than ever and the celeb cameos are hilarious. Kids will love the muppets and the childish humour and adults will be covered from head to toe in Nostalgia and celebrity cameos, this movie is for everyone."

The Muppets are carrying one last show to raise money. In order to maintain their studio before the evil oil tycoon shatters it down. There is only one problem. Have they been forgotten? With the real world reflects just like the story in thiz movie, since the very first stage of movie-making process, thiz movie was way underrated. People keep asking, did thiz movie will actually work? Anyway, look how well the movie is doing now. The Stars sparkle all over the place. The famous frog Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo, Scooter, Animal and other members of The Muppets, can bring the hilarious atmosphere instantly, including the new introduced character, Walter. Jason Segel proves out to be surprisingly talented with his energetic singing and dancing. ENCHANTED (2007) princess Amy Adams is a brilliant choice for her role, she is an unarguable Disney princess figure in human form. The bad guy looks cynical and funny at the same time, played very very well by Chris Cooper. Not to mention, it is featuring endless Celebrity Guests such as Jack Black, Emily Blunt, Zach Galifianakis, Whoopi Goldberg, Selena Gomez, Ken Jeong, Sarah Silverman, Neil Patrick Harris, John Krasinski and even Dave Grohl from FOO FIGHTERS. James Bobin made his directorial debut through thiz movie. The songs are part of thiz musical extravaganza. The singles like LIFE A HAPPY SONG, ME PARTY or MAN OR MUPPET are one of the best moments. The ending scene is effective (Spoiler Alert!). When is told that they have finally got the appreciation and applause from millions of people outside the studio. It is simply to say, we could have happy tears along. It is not just about the Muppets anymore. But it is also about every one of us who have grown up with these guys. Whether we realize it or not, in that very moment, we had a sort of feeling, it was like we looked back the years we had been through and we suddenly realized how much we had already changed. The innocent world that we once had is exist. The Creator Jim Henson must be proud of what they have done. Thanks, guys. Thanks for bringing us the third greatest gift of all, which is the laughter! When they do, they have got the whole wide world in the palm of their hand.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com"

This is a pitch-perfect movie, both a love letter to the Muppets and their fans, as well as a very funny movie in its own right with a load of in-jokes and self references that are surprisingly funny, considering I usually find that kind of stuff annoying in many movies.

Some funny moments in between the HILARIOUS moments.  I loved the muppets as a kid and always wanted to be a muppeteer, so seeing the love that Walter had, as well as the obvious appreciation that Jason Siegel has for the muppets, it was truly the first Muppet movie worthy a Jim Henson name since his passing.  A great movie with the significant other, or with the kids."

They will always be loved by millions and be cherished for a long time, and I am glad they came back after those long muppetless years, and with such power too. This movie is probably actually my favorite muppet movie ever. The muppet charm we all love was deeply felt and greater than ever. Not only was Jason Segal and Amy Adams amazing additions to the gang but Walter (the cute 3-foot tall brown haired die hard muppet fan) was also a charming little muppet that was added to the gang. But as always, Kermit, Animal, Fozzie, and the rest of the gang really played a big part in the making of the joyful feeling that only the muppets can give. Awesome storyline also gave this movie its delightful mood. The way it fits it's awesome guest stars including Jack Black, Whoopi Goldberg, and Zach Galifianakis. The way it fits all the gut busting jokes that adults can even laugh too, and hard. Sweet musical numbers and even a little drama make this movie great. This will go down as mine and a lot of other peoples favorites for along long long long long long time. It's time to play the music. It's time to light the lights. It's time to bring the muppets back, and make the world bright."

The Muppets contains familiar flashbacks and moments we remember from Kermit and the gang, including a cast of celebrity cameos, and the witty comedy that we always loved from the Muppets.This movie was really funny and also had a lot of heart, which left me happy after the film was over. Is it the best Muppet film? Close, but not really. A tie between A Muppet's Christmas Carol and Muppet's Treasure Island will always be the superior films from the Muppets. I do admit that some sequences got a little too campy (though it didn't lasted too long) and the beginning of the film was too fast paced with it's storytelling. Other than those minor critiques, The Muppets is a must watched film for witty audiences and Muppet fans alike. You will not be disappointed!"

The plot of the movie is as simple as it comes, but this is where the muppets are playing at their strengths. The muppets are weirdos give them something simple and they run with it.  This movie has the exact right tone, and its one of the most fun movies I've watched in a long time. The muppets are mostly useless and that's what's great about them, you just have a blast watching them fail in their \"talents\" in the most charming of ways. Although the cameos are nothing compared to those of the original show, they are still additions which add on to the fun on screen."

I love the retro feel, and the quick-fire jokes (Ted Conference attending, google employee Scooter). Although it seems this is why we have ADD. Some of the jokes toward the end of the movie were just going by too quick. Sure it was hectic for the Muppets, but it shouldn't be for us.This is one time we can say something was better than the original. With Kermit asking for President Carter, and the Ms. Piggy disco sound, It seemed the movie didn't take itself too seriously with the self-deprecating humor and all. It seemed they were trying to say t\"yes we are out of touch!\" I was too young to remember growing up with the TV show, but old enough to remember the cartoons, and the re-runs. I've been waiting for this movie, and it didn't disappoint."

The musical numbers are brilliantly written and every one of them has this infectious energy that never fails to put a huge grin on your face. The movie also has its fair share of laughs. I particularly enjoyed all of the 80s references to \"The Blues Brothers\" and \"Indiana Jones.\" There's maybe one area in the middle where the simplistic story starts to drag it down a bit, but then Amy Adams and Miss Piggy sing an hysterical duet that brings the movie back up, and from there, \"The Muppets\" sails into magical bliss. I'm recommending this to anyone who likes to feel happy. If you're soulless and only enjoy movies that make you feel depressed or angry, stay far away."

It's 100% cheesy, musical, family entertainment but even though I usually give such films a wide berth I was happy to sit through this movie and I'll do it again when it comes to blu-ray. It's hard to fit every old Muppet sketch into the restrictive 90 minute time slot so I understand why some old favourites get little to no proper screen time, but I'm glad they at least used some old jokes to jog the nostalgic memories of us grown-up fans while still dedicating sufficient screen time to the new story to make this worthwhile for a new generation of kids who might have no existing attachment to the franchise."
