Directed by Ron Howard with an all star cast , Backdraft is the story of Chicago Firefighters of Engine 17. The film begins seeing young Brian McCaffrey (William Baldwin) witnessing his fathers death at a building fire. We cut to 17 years later  Brian having just graduated as a candidate Firefighter , he and his older brother Lt Stephen McCaffery (Played By Kurt Russell) don't get along so well , Stephen tempers with Brians station so that Brian is sent to his Department , Stephen looks over Brian & worrys about him after a factory fire , Brian did not listen to Stephens orders and nearly got killed. After a few weeks Stephen convinces Brian to give up being a Firefighter. Meanwhile thorought the movie , the Department responds to numerous calls that have been killing people with Backdrafts. Brian get's a new Job withfire inspector Donald Rimgale (Played by Robert De Niro), Him & Donald  investigate how & who is causing the backdrafts which end in an epic finally and a extremly sad ending. Why do I love this movie ? well beside from the fact that it has stunning special effects & visuals , amazing music & strong performances. I love it being that I watched it at a very young age and since then , my whole life i've wanted to be a firefighter , sure its farfetched & far from real but thats not the point. The movie made me love Firefighters & My dream is to someday be a professional firefighter. I could watch this movie 10 times a day and never get tired of it. Its one of those movies that get's even better after you watch it again & again . Backdraft.....Thank you."

      "text": "This film is decent but seemed like a wasted opportunity. William Baldwin\u2019s character is well fleshed out and his journey through the film is quite well written and believable. Unfortunately no other character including kurt Russell\u2019s character gets that chance.The film is largely about Brian McCaffrey (Baldwin) so it\u2019s a mystery why Russell is first in the cast whose character is too one dimensional. He seems to never be talking about anything but \u201cthe job\u201d.Scott Glenn does a great job as Adcox but seems a little uneven. His motivation only becomes clear at the very end of the film and his lack of regard for Brian is a little hard to believe given what his motivations are.Both female leads are too one dimensional also. Not enough time is spent on the reasons for Russell and De Mornays failed marriage and Jennifer Jason Leigh\u2019s character isn\u2019t given a proper third act.I liked the Irish tradition attached to the fire fighting clan party which you don\u2019t see in films anymore and the brawl that broke out between two different surnames within the firefighting world which you get the impression has been passed through generations.The film builds up to a good ending but overall it\u2019s early scenes were my favourite part of the film when a quite believable world is created but not expanded enough on.Bryan\u2019s friend Tim should\u2019ve gotten Atleast one more scene later in the film but for some reason is just forgotten after a significant moment for his character.De Niro is very good as always and plays his part well but seems totally removed from the rest of the story.A good effort but could\u2019ve been better seems a li"

Well, it has a good plot and a great ending."

      "text": "+Incredible practical action set pieces+Excellent soundtrack from Hanz Zimmer+Great lighting/cinematography+Superb cast-Weak scriptBackdraft is an incredibly well made film from the 90's peak of hollywood cinema sporting a superb cinematic look with a great cast and action pieces. Sadly the screenplay falls short failing to capitalise on some of the many plot ideas instead just throwing it all into the pot giving 'narrative texture' but to the detriment of 'narrative depth'. Despite this the detailed dramatic scenes of Backdraft let the film progress at a good pace yet something feels off with the overall story which left me confused rather than satisfied overall."

      "text": "My father is a firefighter so I have been brought up around it and know that there is quite a bit of \"Hollywood\" special effects and things of that nature that make bits of the film, particularly the firefighting itself, fairly unrealistic i.e. fire doesn't make a lot of the sounds it does in the film, the hose at the last fire flying around in the air, in some parts if you look close you can see that the fire clearly coming from a gas source that is used for fire in a lot of movies.\rAside from all of that I did like the movie. It has a pretty good story line and I pretty much automatically like any movie or TV show that involves firefighting. For example I love Ladder 49 as well even though it is not all that widely liked."
