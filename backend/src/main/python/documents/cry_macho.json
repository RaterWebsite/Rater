      "text": "While I enjoyed watching this movie and I understood the point, I gotta say, emotionally it falls pretty flat. I believe this is largely because many of the decisions that these characters are making would normally require serious contemplation but instead are made with little to no thought at all. Given that, it made it even more difficult to accept Clint's character at Clint\u2019s age. Finally add to that the supporting cast not being very convincing either and you're left with a movie where every emotional (or would-be emotional) crossroad misses the mark. All in all the movie is just poorly cast and it seems like it was butchered in the editing room."

It feels like the main character of the washed-up cowboy should be around 50 to 55 years old. But Clint Eastwood is 90+ and so the scenes where women are swooning over him are a bit ludicrous. With The Mule, Clint\u2019s age worked for the story (old grandpa as drug runner) but in Cry Macho his age works against the material."

It's like anything else in life: you think you got all the answers, then you realize, as you get older, you don't have any of them.\u201dClint Eastwood, man what a legend. My respect for this man hasn\u2019t faded.What\u2019s even more impressive is that at the age of 91 he\u2019s still acting and making movies, which is really inspiring.Also, the fact that 90-year-old Eastwood starred/directed a movie during the global pandemic, where he was the most vulnerable, it\u2019s kind of mind blowing and it's something that I can't get pass.Now for the movie itself, it\u2019s an uneven road trip movie that\u2019s more aimed for an older demographic. I don\u2019t know how to describe it, but everything felt stilted in terms of pace and the film making. The movie also has some questionable scene transitions, such as cutting to \u2018one year later\u2019, which made the previous scenes seem unnecessary.Even then, Clint Eastwood is still charming, and he made me smile at times. Also, the movie looked beautiful.Although, from how I see things, Eastwood is \u201cthe last cowboy\u201d in cinema. From Sergio Leone till now. This movie reflects on that deeply in every visual. His character Mike is past his prime; where horse riding and the inner grit of the west has become a distant memory as the modern age comes creeping in. But of course, in the end he is the hero, like he always has been."

Most dialogues feel empty and trivial, and there almost isn't any internal development in the characters. It also has some nice shots and landscapes, being a quite enjoyable film in visual terms."

      "text": "Cry, Macho or The Little Gallo That Could. Veteran actor Eastwood delivers an appropriate performance as Mike, a down-and-out cowboy looking for redemption and meaning in his later years of life. At 91, Eastwood may not be able to pull off the action stunts like he used to, but he ably bring his character to life on the screen to drive this otherwise dull and dusty screenplay. The plot moves along about as fast as the border line in Tijuana on a weekend and is full of outdated tropes that don\u2019t make the film special in any way. Mike is somewhat of a white savior figure who \u201crescues\u201d a teen boy from the dangers and wanton realities of Mexico in the 1970\u2019s. Mexican police are depicted as incompetent, taking bribes and being motivated by personal gain. A strange subplot where Mike plays Dr. Doolittle for a sleepy Mexican village. And of course, there\u2019s a love story interwoven for good measure.The relationship between Mike and the boy is not fully developed during the course of the film and makes the ending unsatisfying. The credits roll and I didn\u2019t feel invested in the journey the two had just been on. The titular Macho, a cock fighting rooster, is along for the ride as the boy\u2019s security blanket. Macho represents his transition from boy to man (as you will see from the film\u2019s ending) and serves no purpose to the plot other than helping resolve the film\u2019s main conflict (and no, I don\u2019t mean the pacing). Macho\u2019s role in the film is to wrap up a story that\u2019s been going on for too long. Macho doesn't cry in the movie either, though he does get something stuck in his eye. Hmmm\u2026 The plot, while contrived, manages to pull at a few heart strings and is really about the coming of age for the boy and the reconciliation of age for Mike. The action and pacing of the movie harken back to the films of yesteryear - dialogue driven plot with little wiggle room to keep the attention of modern audiences who are desensitized to gratuitous violence, sex, and unexplainable action sequences. The plot needed more action, more Western theme tropes to truly deliver on a meaningful cinematic experience. The film served as decent background noise and gave occasional glimpses of good cinematography. Though somewhat enjoyable, this film does not meet the mark for its potential. This film is not much of a quick draw with how Eastwood hobbles around screen at times, nor is it much of a bullseye."

The picture comes across like an awkward hybrid of classic Westerns, road trip tales and mismatched buddy films, with touches of horse whispering and totally preposterous romance tossed in. Much of the narrative is predictable, saccharine-encrusted and lacking in swashbuckling thrills. The mix yields a thin, uninvolving story brought to life by a lame script and even lamer, one-dimensional acting and character development, failings that even better casting and a more polished script wouldn't be able to help. What's most distressing, however, is that, with Eastwood's filmmaking days dwindling, one can't help but wonder why he would waste his time and talent on an underwhelming project like this. Riding off into the sunset should make for a grand exit, not a hobbled departure."

I know this might seem trivial, but you can't take a film seriously if there's no minimal effort to investigate more and try to insert your characters into a more believable environment. Come on, by that time, the country had already hosted the World Cup and the Olympics, and in the film, it looks like there are only cockfights, dust, and people in sarapes in Mexico City and its surroundings.And we need to talk about those female characters. The evil lady feels like a telenovela villain, and the good one is just an accessory to Mike. In the end, these characterizations don\u2019t support the overall criticism of the \u201cmacho\u201d figure in the movie.The plot is very average, and although I found Mike very charming and funny, it wasn't enough to keep me interested. Let's hope Eastwood has another shot at making a better movie next time."

      "text": "Howdy, Streamers! Cry Macho premiered this week in theaters and on HBO Max, and we watched it on HBO Max. It's the new film from prolific director and Hollywood icon, Clint Eastwood. At 90-years-old, it seems like Eastwood still churns out a movie almost every year, and he frequently has a starring role in his directorial efforts. Here, Eastwood has continued to trade on his legacy of old Western, strong-and-silent, cowboy type. The question here is whether that machismo in Eastwood is still compelling. Let's see how it goes.Based on a 1975 novel of the same name, Cry Macho is the story of Mike Milo (Eastwood), a former rodeo star, who after having suffered a devastating injury began working as a horse trainer on a ranch. Due to indulgence in alcohol and pills and, generally, no longer being reliable as a ranch hand, Mike loses his job. However, Mike's former boss enlists him to go to Mexico City to retrieve his son, Rafael (Eduardo Minett), from his abusive and neglectful mother. The boss' motives are unclear to Mike; nevertheless, with reservations, Mike travels from Texas to Mexico City to pick up the 13-year-old boy. Rafael is troubled, according to his unreliable mother, and Mike finds the boy out cockfighting with his trusty rooster, Macho. As Mike and Rafael travel back to Texas to meet his father, Rafael's mother sends her heavies and the Federales after them. From there, a road trip/lowkey chase movie ensues. It's Gran Torino on the road in Mexico, or many other variations on some Clint Eastwood movies.As we've come to know, Clint Eastwood is a simple filmmaker. There's not a lot of flash. It's all very uncomplicated and easy. Essentially, Cry Macho is a road movie between an old man and a kid where they break down each other's walls along the way. Nothing surprising, and so the emotion is key for this film to work. Like a sucker, it got me. Despite it all, it's a nice movie with a good central relationship. In fact, the simplicity of it all makes it so much easier to be endearing, especially since you know what's coming at almost every turn.If there are problems here, it is because Clint Eastwood is doing his regular Clint Eastwood thing. He is gruff and stoic. It's a carbon copy of many of the roles he has played in the last few years or throughout his legendary career. Eduardo Minett does his best as Rafael, but the acting is rough going - especially in the beginning. Eventually, he gets into the rhythm with Eastwood and they fall into a nice chemistry. I'll also shout out Natalia Traven as Marta because she sweeps in in the last third of the movie and infuses every scene of hers with charisma and beauty.The biggest problem is how basic, with a capital \"B\", this plot is - it tends toward eye-roll inducing except for how charming it ultimately becomes.Although Cry Macho can be bland at times, the central relationship between Mike and Rafael brings charm and sweetness to the film. Eastwood has a distinct style of direction and acting that can be repetitive from movie to movie, but this snuck up on me and has won me over and likely will win other viewers over as well. It's probably only a handful of popcorn for theater viewers, but it's a nice bowl of popcorn for those streaming on a quiet Sunday afternoon."

Clint is obviously much older now and he simply can\u2019t do the same action gun-toting that he used to in his earlier films; yet these new movies don\u2019t suffer for it. And why would that be? Because the film focuses on telling a strong story and having well-written characters that grow throughout the movie. You start Cry Macho with a washed-up rodeo cowboy named Mike, who\u2019s been through hell. His boss of many years is done and fires him but they\u2019ve been through a lot together and so he decides to call in a favor. He wants Mike to head down to Mexico City to retrieve his son from his ex-wife who isn\u2019t treating the boy well. And so the journey begins.Mike finds Rafo and with a little work convinces him to leave Mexico to live on a ranch in Texas with his father. However, his mother is not happy with this and does everything to stop him from leaving. Along the way, in which much hiding from cops and stopping in towns is done, Mike and Rafo learn more about each other and begin to trust each other and form a friendship. By the end, they\u2019ve both become better people thanks to one another.Overall, this movie is worth a watch if you\u2019re looking for a story with meaning and enjoy seeing characters bond over the course of a movie. Also, Rafo has a pet rooster as he was involved in cockfighting. Macho the rooster is a whole character himself, it\u2019s pretty funny."

      "text": "(Mauro Lanari)Like the Woody Allen of senescence who deconstructs himself more and more with each new work, Eastwood insists on using the films of his own old age to distance from his macho cinematic icon. Not a particularly difficult task when you are 91: you just need to be framed. In the embarrassing implausibility of the screenplay by Nick Schenk, already author of \"Gran Torino\" and \"The Mule\", \"Cry Macho\" is a buddy road movie stuffed with scenes tending towards science fiction. Essential, minimalist, simple, linear, frank, gentle direction, with too few things to say and show. The concluding considerations on life and of a life are a jumble of banalities, and the desire to enjoy it and still have a good time at his age is not commendable: it is a surreal exorcism of the sunset boulevard."

What was going through Clint's mind when he was shooting the widow trying to get him (a 91 year old) into bed? I think we should pass around the hat to have all copies of this destroyed to preserve the dignity of Clint's lifetime body of work.I'm a big fan of Clint but this is a movie too far. He is finally too old to play anyone and needs to stick to directing if he still can. A fabulous career deserves a better-ending than this. He's kind of doing a Joe Biden but I don't think a teleprompter would have helped in this case."
