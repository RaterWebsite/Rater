Its more reminiscent of old school sandler movies like happy gilmore. Some laugh out loud moments and cool to see sandler with his happy gilmore love interest. Great Hal L cameo. That was a great way to start the movie."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Adam Sandler has done it again this movie is **** awesome funny as hell the only negative is the critics that expect Adam sandlers movies to suck and even when he makes a **** awesome movie they are to up there own asses to see that this movie is the balls"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Adam Sandler plays a mentally impaired deli worker in this fun-filled, star-studded Halloween romp. You don't want to miss it! Surprises abound, the laughs and scares never stop. You will not be disappointed!"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "This almost feels like a love letter to the Sandler films of old. There are a ton of references made to some of his most notable works and we see him step back into a role similar to the ones he played in movies like The Waterboy and Little Nicky by adopting the persona of a loser with a speech impediment. It's good fun, but while the former SNL star's Netflix outings have gradually been improving in quality Hubie Halloween doesn't quite live up to its inspirations.Some jokes just fall flat on their face and the biggest laughs often come from the supporting cast, which means the Sandman himself regularly has his thunder stolen by his co-stars despite being the one who's onscreen the most. Part of this is due to just how bizarre his character actually is. Happy Madison comedies are always filled with weirdos and oddballs, but Hubie is too cartoonish for his own good with his kitted-out thermos and penchant for freaking out at the slightest fright. There is a likable quality to him however as he really is a good, goofy dude that doesn't deserve all the cruelty he is subjected to. This leads to a nice anti-bullying message that's good for children. In fact, outside of a character played by Maya Rudolph who makes it very clear she's sexually unsatisfied in her relationship and one or two more suggestive jokes this is actually a decent choice for an October family movie night.Overall, this is a solid little holiday caper. Happy Madison's comedy is still proving to be a bit hit or miss these days, but this is easily their most consistently amusing release in some time. It's throwback nature does allow it recapture the magic of Sandler classics like Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore at times as well. However, this is still probably only going to strike a chord with the comedian's most ardent fans.7.4/10"}, {"rating": "2", "text": "One of the worst Sandler films out there. I just feel sorry for the likes of Julie Bowen who were dragged into this wretched mess."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "This movie is okay but Adam Sandler and his character are a big disappointment. It feels like Adam doesn't even try anymore. Even for a kids movie this movie is boring. Yes it has AAA cast but again, main protagonist is just non charismatic. I think Sandler should either try harder as he did in his recent movie Uncut Gems with as brilliant or if he is tired he should just stop shooting movies. 4/10"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I did not expect much from this movie but me and the kids are Adam Sandler fans.

Why does he keep giving himself the same moronic slurred accent and three brain cells? Why are older people in his movies always written so dumb? Why are kids made to be either mean or pure of heart? Easy: he has no ideas. He's tired of making movies. Writing a good script is hard but even if it isn't good he still gets paid. The sets may change but his movies are populated by the same people going through the same motions, living out the same plot formulas."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "\"Never go full retard\" sums up the main character.

I didn\u2019t think the trailer was good at all but I held out up but alas, it was no good. This was so disappointing to me because this is the film that comes out right after his amazing performance in Uncut Gems. The film\u2019s biggest issue is its script and characters. This script is so poorly written that it\u2019s embarrassing. None of the dialogue feels natural. Instead, it feels like an incredibly rough first draft. None of these characters are relatable at all because everyone is so rude and heartless. No normal town would treat one person this way. I know it\u2019s supposed to be a little unrealistic but it was too irritating not to mention. The performances here really aren\u2019t that good. Some of them were fine and harmless like Steve Buscemi but Adam Sandler and Kevin James were pretty terrible. Their performances felt so unnatural and Sandler\u2019s accent was just very obnoxious. The plot itself made no sense at all and felt very loosely put together. It felt as if they structured the story around the jokes which is something you really shouldn\u2019t do. Most of the jokes weren\u2019t that funny anyway. That\u2019s not to say all of them were bad because I did chuckle a few times but not enough to make me think this film was clever. The cinematography and music were fine. The film didn\u2019t look visually bad at all but it didn\u2019t do a whole lot that was interesting. If you\u2019re a fan of Sandler\u2019s style of comedy, then you might get something out of this. If not, definitely pass on it."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "The directors, writers, and producers of this movie are 15 year olds with every mental disability in the entire world. When looking for a good movie I only judge them by this: a good story, it is meaningful, it is enjoyable, and not really offensive. It just fails at every filmmaking aspect.

I expected it to be dumb and silly so with those expectations and knowing what you are going into, then I think it was actually pretty funny. I mean by now you should know what to expect from Sandler's \"not so serious\" comedies - you even can see in trailer that he will be talkin in silly voice etc so like this is obvious if you have his previous comedies, then this isn't for you (even though in my opinion this was better than theme).

Let's say, you have a blender and three ingredients, those ingredients include the following. \"Boomer Humor\", \"Bad Writing\" and \"Comedy so bad that it's good\", don't forget the touch of Adam Sandler. This was one of, if not the most unfunny movie I have seen on my time on planet earth. Had it not been a pandemic, I can assure you the only people that would be watching this are 65 year olds and 3-8 year olds.
