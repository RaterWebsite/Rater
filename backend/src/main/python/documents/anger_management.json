When I watched it, I thought it was hilarious - I could never imagine Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson as such a pairing. The antics that both of them get up to could knock me off my feet any time. I wouldn't say that this movie was peppered with just jokes about private parts, because it wasn't. This film had a deeper meaning than that, especially as it was one man's unexpected journey to find himself.

The Village's twist was a groaner and the last scene of the Last Samurai knocked it down a rung or two. But in a comedy?\r Comedy is about laughter during the journey not the stories conclusion. None of our best comedies are known for their finales. Meet the Parents left with a comparative whimper, There's Something about Mary's ending is at best forgettable, and the bombastic over the top noise of say The Blues Brothers or Caddyshack certainly wasn't for everyone. (The exception to this rule is the wonderful Stay Puff marshmallow man payoff from Ghostbusters)\r Unlike thrillers or drama, comedy rarely invests enough in the plot to begin with for the ending to matter all that much. And an Adam Sandler comedy, lets face it, has less plot than most. (Or at the very least the same plot and characters over and over again. Sandler after all is the Jim Varney of Long Island nerds.) So to create a disaster this momentous you first need a good hour and change of comedy (rare enough esp. with Mr. Sandler on board) then you need an ending so stupendously bad it erases the laughter.\r Welcome to Anger Management. First the good news. This movie has some quite funny bits. The bad news well lets start with the last 15 minutes or so absolutely feel good romantic awfulness with enough celebrity cameos that could sink the Titanic, wipe out any goodwill one feels towards former Mayor Giulliani of New York and embarrass one to be a Yankee fan. Add on a plot device at the end that wouldn't be out of place in a Deanna Durbin film and let the jaw dropping awfulness commence.\r The last 15 minutes aside this movie has some really funny bits. Even stupid stuff like sweaters for overweight cats worked for me. Now that's rare. The set-up is pure gold and the cast is great.\r If anything Sandler is easily theweakest of the bunch. (Luis Guzman and John Turturro's characters needed their own movie and it was great seeing Jack be Jack again after that slog that was About Schmidt. Sandler knows how to do cruel. Anger Management was such a good concept and had such funny execution that it demanded a dark cruel outburst of energy at the end not this indescribably painful schmaltz."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I am not a fan of Adam Sandler, I find he is good in the more dramatic films(Punch Drunk Love and Reign Over Me are his best performances to me) and save a few exceptions(Spanglish, The Wedding Singer and Happy Gilmore) I find him irritating in comedy. However, Anger Management is one of the exceptions, Sandler is quite good here but Jack Nicholson outshines him. The script is funny likewise with most of the gags(the describing-who-he-is scene), the story intriguing, the pace snappy in the first two thirds and the characters fairly likable. What lets Anger Management though are one or two scenes that don't quite work such as the basketball scene and a final third that is not only a little draggy compared to the first two-thirds but rather clich\u00e9d and cheesy too. Overall, entertaining and a better film than I anticipated. 7/10 Bethany Cox"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I really enjoyed this one.  Adam and Jack were great together and it was hilarious.
