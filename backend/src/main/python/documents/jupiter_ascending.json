      "text": "As much as I wanted to love the movie as a chance for Mila Kunis to take center stage and as a Wachowski callback I simply did not find the movie engaging.  The plot was a bit muddled, the romance seemed extremely forced and there just weren't any really likable characters.  Mila Kunis' character, Jupiter Jones, is the protagonist but I never found myself rooting for her.  She was wishy washy at best and so lovestruck by the end that it seemed she had no character whatsoever but what was forced on her by the shoe horned romance.\rWhat I did enjoy:  The visual effects.  This movie does not disappoint on that level.  The CG is amazing and the detail is incredible, if it weren't for the great visuals I would rate this much lower.  The scene where they first come to the Planet Orus and show off the technology is quite breath taking."

Some of the acting and directing choices definitely stray into \"So bad it's good\" territory so if you are a fan of that (like me) it's not a complete lost cause. If you like cheesy sci-fi, you absolutely won't hate this one, especially if you watch it with friends for a laugh."

She was working as a poor maid cleaning toilets until that became known to her. After a lot of adventure and saving the earth, she decides to go back to scrubbing toilets (literally) for a living as a maid. The sci if stuff is fun, but the basic plot is ludicrously unbelievable. A similar plot would be: a maid wins a billion dollars in the powerball but decides to throw all the money away and scrub toilets for a living instead. Yeah right."

This was the best movie since the Matrix.  Even my mother of 65 loved it,  my wife and friends.  As usual so many truths that are are currently hidden to us are meant to be revealed here in a way the general population can digest.  The problem is the population isn't ready for this material yet.   Therefore you see the negative ratings.  Everything from the symbolism of the bees down to the decadence of the ruling elite.  The underlying premise of this movie is closer to reality than most understand.\r As far as the movie and superficial material .. The fight scenes and action were the most exciting I've seen since the Matrix.  Very few movie makers can can bring chills down your spine like the Wachowski's.  The action and special effects already made this movie worth the price of admission.  I may even go back and see it again.  The architecture and style were unique and a pure joy to watch.  PLEASE Keep MAKING MOVIES!"

There was plenty of action, an interesting storyline and sneaky pop culture references that were amusing.  It felt as though it had been heavily cut, however, and could have easily filled another hour or so.\r I wanted to see more of the universe.  It felt as though we were just looking through at a small portion of what this universe had to offer and I had many questions I would have loved to explore further.\r I really hope that there will be a directors cut, expanding on this universe and filling in some of transient scenes that felt missing.  The acting was excellent and the dialogue between characters felt real and not forced.  It was artistic and beautiful without sacrificing the storyline, though I wish there had been more of it.\r Not as amazing and ground breaking as the matrix trilogy, but a great watch."

This movie was not made for the masses.\r I went into \"Jupiter Ascending\", with low expectations after all of the horrible reviews but I was hopeful the Wachowski's would deliver something unique. On that note I was not disappointed. (Plus the movie gets bonus points for being original\u2014not a remake or sequel\u2014with a beginning, middle and end.)\r True, the film is dopey with characters named Jupiter Jones, Caine Wise, and Stinger (a guy who lives with bees). The dialog is flat and embarrassing, framed in a fairly simple story with a few twists and turns, And yes the story is completely unbelievable, nonsensical and disjointed with two-dimensional characters, and pacing/editing that exhibits a jumpy start and stop rhythm. But dammit, this movie was FUN and a feast for the eyes!\r With references to Alien, Blade Runner, Brazil, Cinderella, Dune, Men in Black, Planet of the Apes, Star Wars, Fellini's Satyricon, The Wizard of Oz, 20,000 Leagues Under the Seas, and more, \"Jupiter Ascending\" is a Science fiction/ Fantasy love letter to the genre. I'd say it's comparable to Pacific Rim from a few years back, another excellent, and rather silly science fiction/action film that under-preformed at the box office. Highfaluting, half-baked philosophical crap abounds, (there even seems to be a sub-text involving the virtues of cleaning toilets and maintaining regular bowel movements???) and I enjoyed the whole banquet.\r \"Jupiter Ascending\" is a deliciously layered candy bar full of nuts and honey and other weird things you probably shouldn't think too hard about. It's most likely bad for you but tastes so good! I want to go back and experience the film again and see how it holds up on second viewing. Probably too weird for mainstream audiences and too dumb for the art-house crowd, \"Jupiter Ascending\" has future cult film written all over it. Time will tell."

Struggled through about two thirds of it but it's totally unengaging. The main character, Jupiter Jones appeared to be played by a cardboard cutout with no character or acting ability. This movie is visually cluttered and badly scripted. Reasonable basic premise and storyline, but then it's nicked from an old science fiction story, as most of these kind of movies are. I had my misgivings from the start when I saw it was by the creators of the Matrix, yet another reworking of an old science fiction idea padded out with yawn inducing visual and action sequences."

The effects are top notch and the fighting scenes are well choreographed. The space battles and dog fights are also well done. Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis try really hard to make this work and neither were part of the problem.\r The Bad: The supporting cast was not up to the task and just about every one of them (save Sean Bean) was terrible. The villains (Eddie Redmayne, Douglas Booth, and Tuppence Middleton) were especially dreadful. Redmayne's performance was baffling as he's usually a very good actor. In this film, however, he was hammy and over-the-top ... and not in a good way. The story itself is weak at best, full of plot holes and infused with comedic elements that just don't work. Silly would probably describe the film's premise best. Lastly, for a regular Earth girl, Mila Kunis sure can survive a lot, making death-defying escapes, bending the laws of gravity, and ignoring simple science while doing so.

In fact, my 3 rating is high, due to my love for the genre and the Wachowskis. I did love Speed Racer and the Matrix, and I've enjoyed the Wachowskis other movies if not loved. Jupiter Ascending let me down in so many ways. The first half of the movie I found great. Whenever we were on Earth I was pleased. Smiling in my seat. Wowed by the special effects. When we leave Earth it all fell apart. The acting was all very well done, even Tatums. I don't care how well the digital effects are, they just do not move me in anyway. While on earth the gravity boots, the makeup, the digital effects mixed in real-world areas or sets all fantastic. The planet Jupiter was good. The rest just felt so awkward and emotionless. Maybe because we have seen this before, for many years, starting with the oft besmirched star wars. Putting the search for realistic eyes in a digital world aside the story is a complete and utter failure after we leave earth. As if they ran out of story and decided to just repeat what they did on earth in space. More of Kunis character Jupiter falling and being saved by gravity boots. Lots more. This isn't the creative repetition as with the matrix that lets us see the computer world of the matrix is being created on the fly, no this is we have completely run out of time or ideas. Have these movie directors learned nothing from the past? we could have stayed on Earth and armed Jupiter's excellent Russian family and had them fighting with slapstick humor and it would have been a hit. they could have wrote in a story about humans that know of the plot but are helping it along for the love of money. Instead we get repeated extremely lifeless set pieces that we have already seen at the beginning of this movie. So instead, we have another grand missed opportunity. And that is a shame, because no one can do this like the Wachowskis, and every failure will stop more space operas from hitting the big screen. Tisk tisk Wachowski brothers. And tisk tisk to all of your friends who obviously know nothing, or are too afraid to say anything about the course of your creations to you. The moral of the story is you don't need to own galaxies and cleaning up poop ain't so bad as long as you have a wolf-man with flying boots? Did you know you were making such a bad movie so you tried to force feed us an ideal that would let us cope?  Signed: devoted but bewildered fan. I hope you make enough to get another chance.

I whole-heartedly recommend Jupiter Ascending & believe a lot of lazy or cowardly bloggers/reviewers passed on forgivable negatives like wildfire. Frame of mind is always crucial going into a movie. I think going in w/ a purpose, to enjoy a space opera, expecting the worst will allow you to enjoy Jupiter to the fullest. The mistakes made with this one should pave the way for an even better sequel, which I look forward to."

      "text": "In these reviews, I notice two main groups of people - the ones who like a story, and the ones who like the eye candy. If you only like movies that tell a good story, you shouldn't even bother going - the story is pretty simplistic. The special effects, however, were spectacular. I also definitely liked some of the things they ended up doing with the Sci-Fi and how they introduced Jupiter to the greater universe. I also enjoyed how they explained a great deal of the 'aliens' being human while still including alien races. Despite the story being somewhat simplistic, the universe has great potential for expansion though I'm not sure another movie would be a good medium for it. I'd read the book though. In all fairness, despite the former, the movie and the action scenes got a bit tedious at times, but that's not hard to work around.\r Solid 3.5/5 in my book"

      "text": "I am amazed at the negativity surrounding this movie.  Granted it is a sci-fi picture which turns off a lot of professional movie critics, but seriously, its a sci-fi space opera, and its not supposed to have enormous depth of character, or a profound story line.  Its for fun, entertainment.  I found Jupiter Ascending fun and entertaining.  As mentioned in other reviews, the visual is on overload...from the world building to the fashions.  The story is very fast moving, and in this, I wish they had spent a little more time crafting the plot and having more emotion in the acting, particularly concerning \"harvesting\" or how long should society extend life past a normal 90 years.  It would have been fun to explore more of the world, but maybe this would be better for a game, than a movie.  There's something elegant about the movie.  Maybe its the way the bees react to royalty and the elegantly crafted and thought out world building.  This is probably not a movie for everyone, but it is a fun, fun movie to watch....and then to wonder about the creative energies that went into thinking all that stuff up..."
