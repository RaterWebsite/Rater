Remember the wonderful impressions of the scene in the church in the movie \"Kingsmen\"? So here are the impressions almost the entire movie.\r2. The director obviously loves Tarantino, fine jokes, blood abundance and diversity of murder. sometimes people in thecinema was just hysterical.\r3. Great soundtrack, which brought even a song by Queen.\r4. The plot, though not perfect, but it was much better than expected.\r5. Sharlto Copley rocks.\r6. Lots of interesting cameo, even Tim Roth.\r7. The film was made for just $ 2 000 000, and for any who doeth lawlessness udelyvaet \"Adrenaline\" and \"Raid\".\r8. The film was shot in Moscow. Very cool to watch the action taking place.\r9. The film contains a lot of dirty jokes, plenty of jokes is based on the obscene vocabulary.\r10. A number of references to (and not only) the gaming industry."

Hardcore Henry is a FPS with a simple plot that focus in comedy and high octane action with plenty of gore. During the film I was in my head just thinking of the different games it could easily be at that moment. While I was keeping count and I saw some Hitman, CoD, Splinter cell, Metal Gear, there was a point while it could be Infamous or Prototype. As a movie it was a fun experience. As a story it was simple, funny, and with one hell of a satisfying finale.  As a final though I will recommend this movie to any gamer that enjoy any of the game mention, anyone looking for something different or just something fun to watch."

If you're not ready for some seriously carnage - the most graphic violence you ever contemplated might be in a movie - then avoid it like the plague.

The sucker never slows down, yet you never feel like it gets mechanical or routine.  I wish we had a touch more back story on the dude behind this massive experiment, but that's really nitpicking.

      "text": "\"Hardcore Henry\" can be best described as an experimental film. I was intrigued with the concept of a whole action film shot entirely in first person view and the trailers showed some promise for this concept. Unfortunately , the concept did not do any thing for me. The action is visually impressive with stunts that were actually performed by the cast. The par-cor was also pretty impressive and the camera work made the city of Moscow feel like a character itself. However the camerawork actually gave me a few bits of motion sickness. I had gotten a few headaches from viewing the film after the first hour. The first person camera could have immersed the viewer into a gripping story but unfortunately the story itself is merely nothing more than a connection of the action sequences. The action sequences are impressive  The characters themselves are merely there to play a specific role. The main love interest is only there to be a love interest and the main villain is only there to be a villain.  In fact one plot thread that didn't lead anywhere was how the main villain has magnetic like powers. I was hoping that it would be explained but instead it was frustratingly put in the film with no explanation. Henry himself is really nothing more than a blank slate for the viewer to put themselves in order to immerse the audience into the experience. It is a commendable effort but it failed to do this for me personally. In my opinion this kind of perspective works well in a video game since I am directly in control of the character but in a film though we are watching through the perspective of a character in a story that is non interactive. The one character who does stand out was the scientist named Jimmy. His motivation was what got me enrolled into the plot and his eccentric personality got some laughs out of me as well. This film will have a massive fan base since the concept is unique but I am personally baffled by the critics saying that it is the best action film since\" Mad Max Fury Road\" . What made \"Fury Road\" work was the fact the action was supported b a narrative with a simple surface with complex layers and it had characters who the audience could route for against an adversary who was intimidating. At the end of the day though, your enjoyment of the film will sole-fully depend on how much you are willing to tolerate the shaky cam and first person view. It lacks any kind o nuance but to the films credit though, it knows what it wanted to be and didn't try to overstep its bounds. It will please a lot of people but it just wasn't for me."

      "text": "Enjoy video games? POV first-person shooters? Action movies? Unbelievable movie-going experiences?  Being a part of something completely different and revolutionary for the cinematic art medium? Having a good time? A really really good time? Then Hardcore Henry is undoubtedly a movie for you.\r Playing more as a virtual reality experience than anything else, Hardcore Henry is the first ever POV action film where the audience doesn\u2019t miss a beat as Henry; a resurrected human turned robotic super human man who climbs walls, falls out of buildings, jumps, runs, kicks, shoots and his way to save the woman he loves, Estelle (Haley Bennett), from a telekinetic super baddie Akan (Danila Kozlovsky) who is out to release his own army of Henry wannabes and uses Estelle\u2019s and Henry\u2019s technology against themselves. That\u2019s pretty well it for narrative, but Hardcore Henry is not about story, heck, it isn\u2019t even about redemption. Hardcore Henry is unlike you have ever seen on the big screen and is mostly about tantalizing every single sense in your body. The film is a go, go, go adrenaline ride filled with shaky cam goodness that will redefine the way action movies are made and expectations of audiences, forever. For real though.\r Exploding its way through the sky with pure craziness and some of the best stunt-work ever filmed, Hardcore Henry is the feature film debut of music video director Ilya Naishuller. Naishuller, frontman of the Russian indie rock band Biting Elbows, who first introduced the first-person action filing in the music videos for their band in their infamous song \u201cBad **** Naishuller directs and launched the band to online fame. After almost 33 million views, with the help of online word-of-mouth,  the support of the Internet, Kickstarter and some studio execs, Naishuller was able to develop his action-packed filming style to the silver screen, this time, with with Henry front and centre.\r Henry, who is never really revealed in the film, was played by ten different stuntmen and cameramen, including its director, gives the literal vision of the film; provided the audience with his complete perspective, and all his kick-assery as well as some flashbacks memories, including a very repetitive one, where his father, played by Tim Roth, encourages Henry at a young age, after taking a beating from some bullies to \u201cswallow the blood in his mouth, stand out, and go spill their\u2019s\u201d. Seems like some violent advice to tell a youngster, hence why Henry is so good at making everyone all bloody and bruised.\r Since its premiere at TIFF in the Midnight Madness programme in 2015, Hardcore Henry was being advertise as a movie going experience, unlike anything you have ever seen before. Thankfully, that pitch has been used with so many other films before this, yet, finally, for the first time in a long time, the tagline can live up to its reputation. Hardcore Henry is a gravity defining, atom bomb of excitement and energy on the silver screen. With a narrative pace that travels at the speed of light, the film never stops or ceases to disappoint fans of the hardcore action genre, it burns through its brisk and enjoyable runtime, and cements its place in your memory for life as one of the most exhilarating films you will ever see!\r Although much praise should be given to the super-sonic stuntmen and cameramen involved with this project, as well as all the dedicated cast and crew who were in love with the making of this film, including Sharlto Copley, who easily hailed the film as the most difficult project of his entire career, the results really speak for themselves. From the catchy use of Queen\u2019s undeniably catchy song \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Me Now\u201d, which I played on repeat while writing this review (hence why you can probably catch many references to the song within the writing), to the brave filming style Naishuller was faithful to throughout the film, to the tremendously sweaty and pulsating score of Darya Charusha, Hardcore Henry is not for the faint of heart, provided endless in-your-face moments.\r Oh, and when we say faint of heart, we mean it. Since the film was mostly shot using a GoPro Hero3 Black Edition camera, the film is for no one person who can\u2019t handle shaky cam, (including my father, who had to leave mere minutes into End of Watch and continued the rest of the film in the restroom). Hardcore Henry is a phenomenal action film and amongst the most superior action films ever made, period. As an action fan, please do not miss this landmark film. By the time the credits roll, despite its lack of deep story and one out-of-nowhere twist, Henry can only be described by the most obvious statement possible: one bad-ass, hardcore mother*cker!"

      "text": "Hardcore Henry is the best video-game movie, not based on any game; it is also the most unflinching, original, breathtakingly inventive and giddily exciting ride of the year, making full use of its great concept , superb technique , pushing it past its gimmicky roots and making one hell of an Indie Action Classic.\r The most impressive aspect of Hardcore is the pacing and how the actors, the director/screenwriter go about to deliver it swiftly, edited to perfection and performed brilliantly. Henry is immensely humanized, considering the fact that his face is obstructed throughout the whole film and is mute, yet through mannerisms and motions, writer/director Ilya Naishuller gives Henry a unique and often times funnily badass personality one that is sympathetic for the audience to root for and play as. Meanwhile Sharlto Copley, brilliantly jumps from various, engaging and weirdly fascinating characters, it\u2019s definitely hard to pull of so many different characters and retain significance and constantly come up with witty performance tricks that get either get the audience\u2019s blood pumping or get their interests peeking. Danila Kozlovsky plays an exceptional villain, one that is perverted, hyper-stylized, yet gets to pull one or two of his own great gags that evoke a feeling of fear and comedy. Whilst Haley Bennett is charming and convincing as the wife of Henry, wanting his safety and security, and hiding secrets under the fa\u00e7ade of love and compassion. The story is great too, it is strange, exciting and un-logical in the best possible way, drawing inspirations from various video-games and providing them with a new perspective.\r However it\u2019s the action in Hardcore Henry that is the most important, full of adrenaline, kinetic energy and meaty violence, Naishuller makes even the shakiest of images stable and clear using long takes of sweeping carnage and choreography that gives The Raid films a run for their money. In particular a wild, on-rails motorcycle chase with a minigun is not only awesome on its own, with passages through enemy vehicles and tearing of enemies with the high-caliber bullets that shred the forces of AKAN into pieces and thrill with unparalleled ferocity and drive. The Brothel shootout is mind-blowing too, full of utterly spectacular gun-fu action, that is punctuated by the picture\u2019s bucket load of guts and blood, with a little of misogyny which is always pleasant to see in today\u2019s Ultra-feminist society. The last 30 minutes of Hardcore are pure insanity and a barrage of almost gratuitous violence, head explosions, decapitations, savage beat downs and wall to wall action that had my heart pumping and sweat dropping at an almost alarming rate. Made even cooler and jaw-dropping by the fantastic score of the Director\u2019s band \u201cBiting Elbows\u201d, being their long-time fan, it was sweetly energizing to hear some of their new tracks at just the right moments to give the action even more punch, and yes Queen\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t stop me now\u201d is also here and yes that scene is the best part of the movie.\r Hardcore is as advertised a cinematic breakthrough and a terrific endeavor from the Russians, that created something truly new and exciting, it is a masterpiece of an action film, made impressively immersive by its POV style and engrossing by its story, plot, and characters, Kudos to Naishuller and his team for making this work.  It is worth every cent of every dollar and even my  5 dollar donation back in 2014.\r and yes I do feel proud of that :D"

Every minute was action packed and every fight scene was violence for the sake of violence and ridiculous for the sake of being ridiculous.

      "text": "With such a focus on originality today, many filmmakers feel pressured to go out and find the next big thing. Unfortunately, the POV first person camera may be the next big fad in Hollywood, and that\u2019s not good. Hardcore Henry is very original, but has no real story, and contains a lot of nauseating camera work. The biggest problem, is us, we\u2019ve encouraged things like this film to happen, and now we have it.\rToday\u2019s critics seem to latch onto one critique more than any other, and that is the originality argument. Many people will tell you no film today is really original, but then a film like this comes along. Shot like a videogame this film is original in both look and narrative, however, the focus on creating this video game like look lead to a weak storyline. It seems sad that our generation just craves things that are original, so much so that when we get it, we don\u2019t care about quality.\rThe greatest flaw of the film is the narrative, or serious lack thereof. Many, if not all, characters are grossly underdeveloped, especially the villain who is goofy and weak. The story is more of a incoherent assembly of scenes, that does little more than further the confusion. It seems that from the outset, Hardcore Henry was always about the POV feel and look. It is ironic, because the film is plotless, and the action doesn\u2019t really look good either.\rThe gimmick of this film is for the audience to feel like they are in the shoes of the main character. The problem is the main character bobs and weaves so much the film is more on a nauseating set of fight scenes. On top of the terribly shaky action sequences, where very little is visible, the film is poorly edited, furthering the confusing story by jumping around randomly. On top of that, the way the characters and story are presented, time in the film is totally jumbled, and nothing seems to make sense until the end of the film, at which time it\u2019s too late.\rIn conclusion Hardcore Henry, is an all-out attack on it\u2019s viewers senses, as they are put through a non stop set of nauseating action sequences. The film has no real story, and throws characters in and out of the film, creating a confusing mess of a story. So yes the film is original, but that doesn\u2019t make it good or worth watching, because there\u2019s a gross lack of craft in this film. I suggest you don\u2019t watch this film because the only selling point is the new POV shooting style, which alone is not enough to make a good movie."

Its either way ahead of its time, or everyone else has just utterly failed to deliver novel action, and video game-to-movie synchronicity. This shoestring budget, sophmore job by Ilya Naishuller will go down in history as the first movie that got so very much right for the first time.

If you want fun, you'll get fun in front of your face because this movie keeps the action going and the adrenaline pumping. I actually got goosebumps watching this movie. Guys, if you're looking for a fun, action-packed, bloody good time. Don't forget to check out 'Hardcore Henry'."

If you find some of the action being repetitive (which I didn't, but I can understand why some people will), please stick all the way through it. It has the most pitch perfect ending that could have possibly been written."

After watching the movie you don't feel betrayed by the trailer..a rare attribute these days.\r Meglio di quanto mi aspettassi. Non \u00e8 un Blockbuster ad alto budget, non sar\u00e0 uno dei migliori film azione dell'anno ma non \u00e8 neanche un film demenziale come i film-meme in stile Asylum. E' un B movie vero e proprio ma di quelli divertenti. Pieno di umorismo ed azione, girato in modo originale. Le riprese in soggettiva per i primi 15 minuti di proiezione possono risultare fastidiose..... ma dopo che ci si abitua il film scorre senza problemi ed \u00e8 divertente assistere alle scene degli stuntman da questa prospettiva insolita. Spettacolare il combattimento finale. Il film \u00e8 proprio come vi sembra dal trailer...se vi \u00e8 piaciuto quello potete andare al cinema tranquilli"

I paid, and I do not like leaving early, but if there was ever a movie I wanted to walk out on it was this one.  This is simply a video game from the perspective of Hardcore Henry.  Yes, I knew what it was about.  I had seen plenty of sneak peaks over the last couple of months to peak my interest, but after a while you can only take so much of that kind of shaky camera perspective.  This movie makes the Blair Witch Project genre of reality perspective films look like still footage in comparison.  There are a lot of positive reviews of this movie, but I have to imagine it is from those people who love this type of video game massacre.  I do not mind violence in movies, but to kill at a rate of 10 people per minute of film scene is crazy.  Henry is mute and so the majority of the film he is just a killing spree being guided by the mysterious Jimmy.  I won't spoil the movie for you, but if you are not a video game junkie that blood lusts, then you might want to go watch a less violent movie like Friday the 13th.  At least your eyes will be able to focus on the murderous demon and his piles of death."

I really wanted this movie to be good what with the super cool FPS-movie gimmick it had going, but it's just garbage in pretty much every category. Obviously this movie wasn't trying to be some blockbuster high budget movie, but you can't even enjoy the FPS action because it is just so poorly filmed which was the whole point of the movie. Stablise. Your. Footage.\r Also the villain was written to seem creepy but he just ended up cringey. Like he graduated a C+ student from the Tommy Wiseau University of Cringe. A prestigious establishment no doubt."

      "text": "Maybe with all of the advancement in VR tech, it's a good idea to make a film that satisfies one's deepest desires not achievable in AAA titles. Or...maybe not. \"Hardcore Henry\" is an action-packed (emphasis on the \"packed\") 90-minute 1st person thrill ride that puts audience members in a visceral and nauseating position. The endless barrage of action sequences stacked on Cloverfield-approved camerawork may have you regretting not picking up a couple of aspirins before the opening trailers.\r The early 2000s game plotline opens on a lab setting where synthetic goodies are being stitched to the protagonist/director/audience's body by an increasing gorgeous Estelle (Haley Bennett) who claims to be the wife of said character Henry. Just before our hero's voice can be activated, the lab is raided by heavy-armed men at the command of telekinetic albino antagonist Akan (Danila Kozlovsky) whose B-button weapon is the death of story originality. Next, there's the first of many struggles, complete with an impossible dive from the airship housing the lab and the inevitable kidnapping (inciting incident) of Henry's wife.\r A classic run'n'gun-inspired button tutorial follows as Henry makes his way through Moscow until he encounters an alley named Jimmy (Sharlto Copley) who feeds him mini-missions which ultimately lead him to the final boss who wants to take...over the world? Gripping.\r \"Henry\" is a free-for-all of the most epic moments in video game history adapted into live-action form. No matter how impossible, no matter how grotesque, it check off every gamer's to-do list without breaking a sweat or breathing for that matter. At times, it feels more like the creator's personal quest to produce the world's first action trope encyclopedia than a Friday night flick.\r The excessive stuffing of crude excitement eventually becomes the film's undoing as we are left with little personal involvement aside from Copley's comedic antics. If doused in paint thinner, it would be unfortunately reduced to a VFX YouTube playlist, modern stereotypes and a thinning plot.\r Still, newcomer Ilya Naishuller's technical direction reflects a struggle for true innovation in the action genre and whose efforts closely align with those undertaken decades ago by a young George Lucas with a breakthrough experiment called THX 1138. While innovation may be present, cinematic merit is awarded to quality, not quantity much of which is absent from the film's foundation.\r The muted superpowered hero and the creative annihilation of the interchangeable NPCs may speak to the Millennials whose ideas of entertainment are built around the freedom of Grand Theft Auto and the immersive nature of Battlefield, but ultimately the film's incapability of delivering user control, the most alluring feature of such an experiment, denies itself submission to the list of great modern action films.\r There has always been a thin line between gimmick and game-changer but taking a half-hearted step forward is only two steps back.\r --FilmReviewWeekly"

The first-person perspective was surprisingly effective for the majority of the film, although it admittedly became excessively shaky at times. As for the performances, the obvious standout here was Sharlto Copley, who completely nailed his role and owned every scene he appeared in with his zany performance! As for the rest of the film, despite what I considered to be a rather ridiculous third act, the first two thirds of the film had me completely enthralled and on the edge of my seat! Overall, this should prove unique and innovative enough to satisfy most action junkies and keep them entertained from start to finish!"

      "text": "My son plays first-person shooter video games, mostly Call of Duty, all the time. He is not interested in Hardcore Henry. You may be familiar with the objection: He doesn't wish to watch a video game he cannot control. The funny thing is I've probably held a game controller for less than a half hour my whole life. Somehow this PoV experiment intrigued me.\r First-time director Ilya Naishuller explains that you get a believable immersion by strapping a GoPro on your surrogate at mouth or chin level. You don't want him to speak because it would break the believability. What else do you need to know? Strap in (as long as you're not the queasy type) because you are going for quite a ride. Hardcore Henry is truly an original cinema experience, and mostly it works terrific.\r Another funny thing is gratuitous gore is not really my thing. Don't let anyone tell you this movie holds back. You'd think there's a carnage Oscar category or they're getting paid by the body. I won't say it is tastefully done, but in the world of Henry, ultra violence works fine.\r The filmmakers are a little afraid of breaking the spell they have created by the pacing. They don't wish to provide too much relief. Personally I think this is a mistake. After all, Hardcore Henry is at heart a suspense thriller. The story would benefit from a few more misdirections and a bit more character development. But then I am asking a lot. As it is Henry is pretty busy staying alive and solving the case. Honestly it is enough that the producers, director, actors, and stunt people (and the glorious city of Moscow) invested so much heart into Hardcore Henry.\r I am going to see it again soon."

He's been transformed into a superhuman, who is thrust into a world crammed with people out to kill him. Like a character in a video game, Henry barrels through all kinds of obstacles and incredible stunts leaving an outrageous body count. The extreme violence is highly imaginative and flies so fast that's it's sometimes hard to follow. The reasoning behind the plot is murky (even though it includes some cool sci-fi elements), but it's all about the insane intensity of the carnage and breathtakingly ingenious filmmaking."
