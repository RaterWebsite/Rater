However, the story truly does not live up to the deep, thought-provoking epic that the marketing campaign lead us to believe we would see. The final product of Gemini man feels like a tech-demo starring Will Smith with about thirty minutes of script hidden behind some good action scenes. While the action is fun, and Will Smith does have some good one liners, the action lacks weight. As far as the tech showcase we were supposed to see with the deaging and the HFR, there really is not a noticeable difference between this format and regular high definition. This might be an okay movie to throw on in the background, but there was nothing here that grabbed my attention."

So many characters that other characters have to remind you of who they're talking about with nudges like \"the bald guy\". Real subtle. Meetings on meetings to rehash what we already know!

Its def worth the premium pricing because the action throughout the movie is on a different level with 3D effects and higher frame rate. Usually movies are changed to 3d post production and they don't do 3D justice, however this movie was filmed with 3D in mind and it shows. As for the story, to be honest its pretty straightforward, there are no twists, you can tell from the very beginning how the story will unfold. Its an action flick. and thats all it is but because of the visual aspect, i would say its worth it in theaters rather than waiting for it on tv. If you already saw the joker and want to see another movie, i would go give it a try lol"

      "text": "Will Smith does some of his best acting in this film, which is doubly impressive since he's essentially playing 2 roles. First, he's a 50ish government assassin who's ready to retire. He also plays the 20-year-old clone of himself, who is sent to kill the original version. This is supposed to be an action film, but there's too much conversation, which dulls the pace. Most of the fights aren't special with the exception of an incredible motorcycle chase that's impressively close up and wild. Director Ang Lee has directed with an assured hand, but the lackluster script gets in the way and slows him down. As for the de-aging effect, it's pretty impressive and the most memorable thing about the film. One woke change: The older version of the character teams up with a much younger woman, but they do NOT end up in bed!"

Will Smith's acting was good, there was plenty of tension, the fighting was quite intense, and the father-son relationship built between Henry Brogan and Junior was touching.If the movie had intentions to comment about how men feel like younger versions of themselves make them obsolete as they age... well done. Touching, sad.The bad guy's reasoning was more James Bond madness than an interesting philosophical idea, but it did serve as a motivation.The most nonsensical thing in the film was a 40 pound, stick figure of a girl beating up a man 3 times her size, but hey, Hollywood and its fantasies, what can you do?I enjoyed this movie more than expected.

Just a nitpick but I would\u2019ve liked to have known how he survived and how Henry found him. Final Verdict: Gemini Man is an enjoyable flick with some truly impressive technology behind it that is worth checking out if you are interested, and it\u2019s a shame that it hasn\u2019t been doing very well at the box office."

      "text": "I saw it in 4K 60fps 3D. I recommend you do too. First of all, the technology used to recreate Will Smith as a young guy was hit or miss. In some scenes it was very convincing, but in others I could sense the same dead eyes and weird expressions that I\u2019m used to from videogame cutscenes. There was a sappy college campus scene at the very end that looked particularly bad from a CGI perspective. His jean jacket looked like maybe a PS3 texture. Second, the movie itself wasn\u2019t bad. It was an action film. It would have been better if the violence felt more impactful, but like in many films the characters seemed to be able to shrug off bullet wounds, take enormous physical abuse with just a few aches and minor cuts, and heal lacerations and abrasions at remarkable speed. I thought the story was passable. A little bit of Bourne, a little bit of Orphan Black. It\u2019s not going to win any awards and some things (such as the implications of cloning or the super soldier program) could have been done a lot better, but it wasn\u2019t terrible by any means. I did think there was an interesting point raised at the end by the main villain. Now, as to the 60 fps. I thought it was amazing! It was so clear, it was like being there. Right off the bat I got this feeling of the veil being lifted, like a layer of vaseline that pervades all other films had been wiped clean. It was very easy to follow the action, even just camera pans, and to feel a part of it. The actors could not hide behind the judder of film creating artifical gravitas. Instead, I was there with them, seeing what they were ACTUALLY doing in each scene. It is un-movie-like, because I think we\u2019re used to the obscuration of the low frame rate \u2013 think about when you\u2019ve seen \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d features or \u201cmaking of\u201d clips shot on video, where it feels like you\u2019re seeing the ACTUAL scene and actors revealed without the layer of \u201cfilm\u201d turning it into a film. That\u2019s what it felt like, like we\u2019re getting to see a whole movie done like that in a much more true-to-life way. I didn\u2019t notice any of the lack of depth of field that a couple of reviewers have complained about \u2013 there was quite a lot of depth focus / blurriness as well as decent 3D. I would say the 3D effect was used sparingly and didn\u2019t take center stage. I\u2019ve certainly seen more pronounced 3D, going all the way back to Avatar 2009. I had no trouble following anything or taking it all in, in fact I would say it was the opposite \u2013 but this type of film might lend itself more to that, since (other than young Will Smith) there was effectively no obvious CGI whereas The Hobbit film was mostly CGI.Now, as to the action sequences \u2013 WOW. The first scene that made my jaw drop was the motorcycle chase scene and attempted assassination. It was stunning! The other scene that I would say really showed the potential was a fight scene between the two Wills down in some sort of catacomb with skulls. It was so easy to follow the fast action and to know everything that was happening (unlike, say, the Bourne films). There were other flourishes throughout the film \u2013 the drowning scene felt extremely real, whereas slow motion breaking bottles and water splashing were pure eye candy. On a 120Hz or 240Hz television with frame interpolation turned on, there are obvious artifacts everywhere you look and the effect is fairly unpleasant (despite the fact that 90% of the LCD televisions I\u2019ve seen in peoples\u2019 homes have the feature turned all the way up). This was smooth but also immaculately clear with no artifacts, obviously. I\u2019d love to see what 120fps looks like (no currently available projector can do 120fps in 4K with 3D). Overall I didn\u2019t find it distracting (the young Will CGI was sometimes immersion-breaking, however). I really liked it, I\u2019d just like to see a better film utilize it. Actually I can think back to a lot of existing films that would have benefited from this."

      "text": "Boring, emotionless, lazy and above all else... A waste of your time. I wondered for nearly two hours how this abomination came to be... But then i saw David Benioff credited as writer, and suddenly everything made sense again.The story: Will Smith is a hitman, who is indoctrinated with the idea that he's 'the best', even though no arguments are presented to support that theory, nor are other assassins presented. Nonetheless, we watch a movie with over one hour of lazy and emotionless conversations that haven't been changed from the first draft of the script. Will Smith, who is usually such a good actor, has no emotional reaction to hearing that someone used his DNA to create a Clone before the first sheep was cloned... The ****Some of the fight scenes are impressive by using high frame rate camera's, but can't elevate the movie higher than something that looks like it was filmed on a spare requisite set. Supposed soldiers die like flies, and the laws of physics only apply to those that aren't working for the government. Yuck.I could go on about this abomination, but the fact remains that this movie is underwhelming and lazy in each aspect. Stay away from it, don't watch it on any streaming platform, and go watch Rambo: Last Blood. Sylvester Stallone is not a good actor, but his performance is Shakespeare compared to Gemini Man. I give this movie a 3/10. It is a terrible movie."

      "text": "Seen before, done many times, there isn't much new with \"Gemini Man\" except it's gimmick feature of cloning.That being said, it's not bad, it's just simple. The story is basic and has been similar to the plot of many other action films that involve government security. Although they play it safe it does excite, it does draw you in, and it is enjoyable. What counts most in movies like this, that try to get you asking questions, is the ending. When you think of the plot and soak in what just happened, you cannot help but think \"oh, it's a less complicated Bourne movie.\"Acting from its lead, Will Smith, is great and he is in incredible shape for his age. He is undoubtedly committed and truly becomes the character that's been written for him. He is impressive when acting out his clone, however the CGI is hard to watch. For the most part it works, but some scenes focus too much on his face, forcing the viewer to dwell on the fakeness of the CGI. The supporting cast are also quite good, although a little shallow with them not being fleshed out as well as they could have been. This isn't because of their acting ability, but because the writing was simple.At the end of the day, what takes away from this film is it's writing. It could have explored the moral choices and consequences of cloning a little more but all we get is a little conversation at the end with no real outcome. If not that, it could have made the plot of government conspiracy a little more complex and heavy.Good acting. Fun time. Uncomplicated."

My mistake was to watch a lot of reviews of this movie before attending cinemas and I was negative anticipating everything from this movie, but.....Fine, let's break it down by parts what was really good and what was bad in my opinion as a viewer who likes Will Smith acting.Good: Actors.Will Smith - he was decent here, not the best role ever but his acting here was good 910.The rest actors were not very impressive, tbh I don't even know who are they. The girl usually acting in some mysticalhorror movies, not best choice IMHO.CGI:Since it's my first HFR movie, everything in the movie was above and beyond. Yes, guys, it's not marvel or dc, you will not see super effects or super fights, but believe me or not, the HFR makes this movie really good. Every chase scene, every fight scene feels so smooth that you can't even share it here by text. It's really worth your money. It's almost the same when you spent all your entire life on 60hz monitor and switched to 144hz with G-sync. It's like the next level. Unfortunately, I watched some reviews before the movie and it was my biggest mistake since almost everyone said how this bad the movie is. How bad young Will Smith was in CGI perspective, etc. And because of that, I was watching very closely at young Will Smith, I was trying to find anything just to confirm what critics said, fortunately, didn't find anything. Even my friends who are not watching movies that much, even trailers, said: 'How that young actor was really good, interesting who is that guy, never seen him before in any movies'. Well, that was a bit fun for me, and I've explained that it's CGI, etc. Hence they said it was really good. So let's say we are satisfied with it. For such movie - 1010(if it were marvel movie type then the mark would be a lot lower.Chasingfight scenescamera:HFR really matters here. The camera was very smooth in every scene, zoom- zoom out was not shaking at all, everything was in the move and very smooth and at the same time very dynamic. There are scenes that are shot by 1 frame (scenes which are continuously going for 20-30 seconds by a single camera, with cool views and angles).Motobike chase scene - very dynamic and fast, especially with HFR. To believe in it, guys you must watch it. Do not believe or trust anyone else review, watch your self and make your opinion regarding this movie. Catacombs fight scene - if not HFR, nothing really special here. Just 2 guys fighting between each other. But with that frame rate, it feels so fast, so smooth... I was watching that scene on a 1 breath. From technical point and operators' work - I have nothing to say, this is probably something the best I ever saw recently. It was really worth attending the movie to check yourself.Now it's time to discuss what was bad in the movie, which could be improved:Soundtrack - nothing memorable, very usual and static. They were applied very well in the fightingchase scenes, but nothing extraordinary to remember, so 410.Storyline - 404 error: the storyline is not found. Very cliche story, cliche characters, even Will Smith. 4.510.Action - movie basically has 3 or 4 action scenes with the shooting which is extremely low for such movie. Watching this movie in HFR gives you the wish to see more and more action but the movie is not giving it to you... Like teasing you... I was very satisfied with that few actions scenes, but I am not glad that its count is ultra-low. 410.Overall, I think I covered everything that was really important for me in a movie, the details I paid attention to, etc. I hope it was helpful. Cheers guys and as I mentioned above, see the movie and make your opinion about it."

Has very good action sequences and Will Smith is brilliant as both Henry Brogans older and younger self. The cast all do well enough acting as well. What lacks is the ending wasn't the best for me as when the antagonist dies it dosent feel impactful and feels that the final blow was to easy. Also the villian is a bit to weak and never gets involved in the action. Theres also another plot twist at the ending but you find out it leads to nothing and gets your hopes up, to drop them back down again. There was one death that seemed pointless and when it happened I was more surprised and wondering if they really died than being saddened or feeling the stakes getting higher. The start and middle though had two brilliant action scenes and were highly enjoyable. This might be a generic action movie, but it sure is good, fun and thrilling for the most part."

The action was great, having Will Smith act both characters was interesting and the film does raise some interesting points about cloning and modern warfare. Yes, the human drama and script could've have been smarter and more profound - a golden opportunity for a great movie was definitely missed here - but overall, it was a solid, entertaining movie."
