We learn now that he wasn't wearing a bathing suitAnother scene shows Kathryn getting mad at her housekeeper, Mai-Lee. Mai-Lee accidently hurts Kathryn while doing her toe nails and Kathryn yells at her in VietnameseA third scene is from the end of the movie, when Kathryn and Annette meet each other in the bathroom of Manchester. Only a minor change of dialogue takes place here thoughFinally and most interestingly there is the alternate ending scene. Sebastian still gets hit by a car, but not because of saving Annette. He just stops fighting when he sees her standing across the street and gets hit when he crosses it. This scene is probably changed to the version as it appears in the movie because his death is more heroic that way."

      "text": "A fantastic update about the rules of seductionCruel Intentions was my favorite movie when I was 14, to me it was everything I just wanted to be as a teen, despite how cruel and manipulative Kathryn was, I thought she was the coolest and strongest female character I'd ever seen on film. Now a couple years afterwards I read the book and saw the original Dangerous Liasons with John Malkovich and Glenn Close, I still very much enjoy Cruel Intentions. Like I said, this was just a terrific updated version of the ultimate story of love and betrayal, it was a little Dawson's Creek at moments, but from what angle they went at, it was understandable. It had the biggest stars: Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillipe, Reese Withersppon, Tara Reid, Joshua Jackson, and Selma Blair. May I say they gave extremely impressive performances, but the best without a doubt goes to Sarah Michelle Gellar, she was just ultimately brilliant as Kathryn Muertiel, the cruelist girl in school who's goal isn't to be the most popular, but to dominate everyone's innocence.Kathryn and Sebastion are step brother and sister, they have a partnership together to work the school into a total wave of turning the most innocent into the most corrupted. They also have a love for each other, but Kathryn is the only girl Sebastian can't have, it kills him and she teases him constantly over it. Kathryn asks Sebastian if he could help her corrupt the girl that took her boyfriend, Cecil, a naive young girl who is under Kathryn's wing, but isn't aware of her intentions. But the plot thickens when Kathryn finds out that Cecil is in love with her black music teacher which her mother wouldn't like very much. Then Sebastian finds a girl, Annette, who believes that people shouldn't experience the act of love until they are in love. He and Kathryn make a bet while he seduces Cecil, that if he can corrupt Annette, he gets to bed Kathryn. But there's one problem, he might be in over his head when he starts to fall in love with Annette.Cruel Intentions is a great movie with good, strong performances. For what might have been a typical teen movie, this was just a good idea on where the director made decisions on how to make the story real. It's very romantic, heart breaking, and even has it's dark comedic moments for a little breath of air. I will always recommend this film to anyone, it's a great story. I would also highly recommend to watch Dangerous Liasons along with Cruel Intentions, so you have a little bit of a different variety. You'll find yourself a bit seduced with these movies."

      "text": "Breaks the barrier of the conventional teenage genreSarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy) stars as Kathryn, a manipulative woman who places a bet with her step brother Sebastian that he can't get the principal's stepdaughter Annette into bed.Based on Choderlos de Laclos' novel, Cruel Intentions brings a dark and sexy tale of lies, manipulation and romance to our screens in a dramatic and diverse way, with superb acting and excellent direction and acting.The lead three actors, Gellar, Phillippe (Flags of our fathers) and Witherspoon (Walk the line) are all tremendous in their respective roles and do the plot justice by giving sexy and sophisticated performances in one of the sexiest dramas of the 90's.The plot is very character driven, which was helped along by these great performances. Focusing strongly upon ideologies of love, sex and trust, Cruel Intentions breaks the barrier of conventional teenage films by being serious with strong issues rather than slapstick with no point.Very consistent and sophisticated is the narrative, and these issues give a little side story and advice to teenager viewers about the do's and don'ts in relationships. This film has convinced me to give the novel a try.Ryan Phillippe is the star of the show with a very dramatic and calm performance as the lover boy, very sarcastic and smart in his approach to dealing with the opposite sex.Gellar's performance is remarkable, an intelligent portrayal of Kathryn.The whole concept of sex is staring at you in the face for the majority of the film, with controversy also showing, making the film a thought provoking film that is an essential watch, and one of the finest acted teenage films of recent years."

      "text": "Questionable acting and some bad script decisions aside, Cruel Intentions is something to be admired for its edgy story and raunchy personification of its characters. Ryan Phillippe and Sarah Michelle Gellar take centre stage as step brother and sister Sebastian and Kathryn, filthy rich teen who pretty much prey on the weak minded for their own pleasure.\rSebastian is the slick and handsome teen who woos and seduces the young women he wants, until he no longer sees them as a challenge and dumps, destroying their reputation in the process. His stepsister Kathryn is the manipulative temptress who gets what she wants whenever she wants it, they decide to place a bet that Sebastian cannot tempt and seduce the new straight A student  Annette (Reese Witherspoon), a young girl who has decided not to lose her virginity until she finds love, something Sebastian wants to take advantage of, especially in a film or setting like this where reputation is everything.\rThrown into the mix are a range of other interesting and unique characters, but some who ultimately don't have enough screen time.\rCruel Intentions immediately sets out to impress yet put the viewer on edge with its crude dialogue and sexual tendencies, Ryan Phillippe plays a confident person in Sebastian, but also shows a much deeper and more meaningful side as he gets to know Annette. Reese Witherspoon, as excellent an actress as she is, really doesn't have very much to say, her dialogue seems very constrained throughout the film which limits her talents.\rFor me, Sarah Michelle Gellar was the weakest part of the film, until the last five minutes. Her acting was completely off and her facial expressions were virtually non-existent, this just isn't the same person we seen in Buffy. Her constant teasing of her stepbrother just became annoying and cringeworthy, not for the the reason of it being her brother, but it was just very unbelievable.\rSelma Blair also puts in a decent performance as the airhead teenager Cecile, sought after by her music teacher and manipulated by Sebastian and Kathryn.\rA comedy while also painting a dramatic piece in the closing half hour, Cruel Intentions could hit much higher notes, relying too heavily on its leads to carry the film when a strong cast is already there. But still a nice twist on the typical teen dramedy."

      "text": "\"Cruel Intentions\" is so atrocious and gross that I felt like I needed to take a shower right afterwards. The entire team of this movie was made up of men, so that explains why the whole thing was shot from the male gaze. Witherspoon gave a good performance with what she was given with: a celibate \"Jesus freak\" that decided to give it up as soon as she met the disgustingly manipulative and border-line assaulter Sebastian, without looking back. It's obvious that Sebastian's character was intended to be mysterious and broody but there's a simple difference between complex and completely arrogant. With one half of the relationship being a complete **** and the second half being the stereotype for a \"sweet and innocent,\" vulnerable teenage girl, it doesn't make it easy to root for their relationship. The writers don't make a distinct characteristic shift between when Sebastian's intentions are to win the game he set up with his step-sister, and when he actually starts to feel the real feelings. Coming back to Witherspoon's character, despite the inaccuracy of what a real teenager is like, through all the complications you can still tell she's a nice enough person if you unwrap everything. However, you never really get the chance to \"unwrap\" her character because she's never actually alone. It's clear her character revolves around the way that Sebastian see's her; which is a view point I wish there was less of. Because of never really understanding her true character, it's hard to tell if you want her to be happy or not. All this emptiness in the character and lack of depth is filled with sex scenes that aren't helpful, fulfilling, or benefit the relationship at all. There are a few other disgusting side-plots they threw in; like the step-bro and step-sis (essentially incestual) relationship, and the make-out scene between two girls (basically just purely for fun) which I guess could be classified as queen-baiting in this day n' age. To summarize: this is the biggest **** bag of a movie which they tried to hide behind sensible actors, but didn't work out at all."

This is a great film, all the right elements fall in the right places... perfect cast, jokes and drama.The ending to this film makes the movie if you ask me. And the music is great! Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillipe have great chemistry... The cast gives a fine performance. Yes, its trashy, but its entertaining... it's hip and it's sexy.Cruel Intentions is not your ordinary teen movie, it has more than what meets the eye. An Entertaining, clever pleasure that every movie lover can enjoy."
