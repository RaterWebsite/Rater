And the plot is so clich\u00e9 but so messily convoluted that it pisses me off to no extent. From this comes comedy, unwanted comedy that had me in stitches which is why I cannot give this film no admiration for just how appalling it really is.

The acting, the script, the directing, everything about this movie is so weird and out of place that it's impossible to take seriously. It's obvious why this movie has become such a cult hit. There's a fantastic book called The Disaster Artist (now also a movie) which tells about the making of this... \"thing\" and also about the friendship between the director, Tommy Wiseau, and the actor who plays Mark, Greg Sestero. I highly recommend it and I also recommend watching this movie just so you can say that you've seen The Room, you'll love it."

      "text": "When it comes to filmmaking, there are specific rules...it's not just about picking up a camera, hiring some people off the street to be your actors, and then writing whatever story you want to tell...\r ...This is where Tommy Wiseau's cult masterpiece 'The Room' comes in, a movie that essentially doesn't know how to be a movie. It is written, produced, directed by and starring Tommy Wiseau as a banker named Johnny.\r Johnny lives a sort-of happy life in San Francisco, he is engaged to his \"future wife\" named Lisa (Juliette Danielle), I use the term \"future wife\" because that's what this movie is saying. The first problem with their chemistry is pretty much everything, they do not look like a couple...if you saw the two of them walking down the street, the last thing you would ever think is them being madly in love. Wiseau looks way too old for her.\r The first half-an-hour of this movie is four different sex scenes...these scenes drive the movie nowhere, they just put the movie to a dead standstill. The sex scenes are not at all steamy in the slightest...they are actually quite hard to watch.\r Later we discover that Lisa is having some extra on the side, she calls Johnny's best friend Mark (Greg Sestero), and it turns out that she seduces him and they have sex...on the swirly staircase...that is a very interesting location since the bedrooms are only a few steps up the stairs, and that the front door is beside the staircase, so it's a surprise that none of them get caught. That was close.\r There are so many subplots added to the movie that also lead it nowhere, we hear about Lisa's mother Claudette (Carolyn Minnott) having breast cancer, we never hear about this later on in the movie...we even see Claudette in later scenes of the movie and her health doesn't seem to have deteriorated. There is one pointless scene where we see the young character named Denny (Philip Haldiman) getting into some trouble with a big thug named Chris R (Dan Janjigian)...this scene is over before it even begins. And, of course, who can forget the football scenes...\r ...this is really where the film (can I even say it's a \"film\"?) starts to get dragged down by pointless padding. There is this one scene where we see the main characters; Johnny, Mark, Denny and a psychologist named Peter (Kyle Vogt) dressed up in tuxedos, so you think it's finally the wedding day of Johnny and Lisa. Nope! Wrong, they end up going outside, and toss around the football about three times (yes, I counted), and then Peter trips and falls over, and they decide to go back inside the house. What was the point of this scene? If you took this scene out, it would not affect the movie, but then again, it wouldn't improve much either.\r Later on in the movie, Johnny decides to record phone calls as he begins to grow suspicious that Lisa is hiding something. This is sort-of important later.\r We cut to Johnny's birthday party and all of his friends are there...apart from Peter, if you've read Greg Sestero's book \"The Disaster Artist\", you'll know why. Mark and Lisa decide to feel each other up again... during the party!!! And surprise! They're caught, by a random character who we do not know, nor does the screenplay allow us to get into detail about him, he's just some guy that finds out about Mark and Lisa's affair behind Johnny's back.\r Johnny does find out about this affair, and is very angry about it. The thing is; Wiseau tries to position his audience to make us care and feel sorry for him...I don't care...nor do I feel sorry for him. His acting is so over-the-top sometimes, and laughable, you are fully aware that you are watching the film.\r But the worst performance by far is from actress Robyn Paris, who plays Lisa's best friend, Michelle. I know a lot of people say Wiseau's acting is bad, but her acting makes Tommy Wiseau look like Daniel Day-Lewis. Seriously, she is bad.\r The dialogue here is atrocious, too. \"I did not hit her, it's not true, it's bulls**t, I did not hit her, I did NOT\" *throws bottle in anger and notices Mark* \"Oh hi, Mark\". Or try...\"No, I cannot talk about that now, anyway, how's your sex life?\" Who asks like that?! Better yet, there's that famous \"You're tearing me apart, Lisa\".\r 'The Room' is the worst film ever made, period. It drags, there is a lot of padding, there are stories and characters that are introduced, but then are removed abruptly...and the story is generic and uninspired. God knows what was going through Tommy Wiseau's head when he was making this. Although, it is enjoyable, I am rating this a rare 0/10 simply because it is a film that is bad in every level...but on an entertaining level, it does get a 10/10...for all the wrong reasons.\r You're tearing me apart, Tommy Wiseau."

Me and 7 of my friends were having a movie night yesterday and my friend Stephen brought this with him, claiming \"I don't know what this is and apparently no one on the planet does so we should watch it.\" There was me, Stephan, Mason and Shane who are all male and Anna, Katie, Zoe and Gina who are female (I'm saying this just so I can establish and go into more detail about one of our reactions later) and all of us had different reactions to what we were seeing. Me, Mason Anna and Katie were looking on in confusion throughout the whole thing, Stephen and Shane were laughing uncontrollably, Gina was offended and Zoe fell asleep.\r There was just so much stuff wrong in this thing that I repeatedly asked the question \"why was this made? What possessed Tommy Wiseau to make this? Did he intentionally make this bad? Did he make this to\rsettle debt? Did he actually think he could become a memorable film director?\" I can only answer one of those questions, he became a memorable film director/producer/writer/actor but for the wrong reasons.\r Where do I start? The acting is some of the worst caught on camera. I was in an amateur theatre production by Queen's hall arts called Minor's Strike and I would like to emphasize, it was an amateur production and all of our acting was praised in the performance and I was 13 at the time. These actors, who are around their 30s/40s are acting worse than we did and we were amateurs and hadn't taken acting\rschool at the time. Tommy Wiseau is easily the worst though. He is the worst actor and this film and what goes well with a bad actor you might ask? Badly written dialogue for this bad actor to spout out.\r \"We have a new client at the bank we make a lot of money, anyway how is your sex life\" This is an actual piece of dialogue that was delivered by Tommy Wiseau, imagine that an 8 year old French boy is saying this line and you will get Tommy Wiseau's whole performance.\r There are also these really uncomfortable sex scene moments which is what Gina was offended by. I know that we're in an age where the ESRB raters are awfully sceptical about letting certain age demographics\rwatch certain movies and usually controversy is applauded by audience and that's why Harvester and Hatred got as much attention as they did but this thing in The Room, these sex scenes which is applauded by possibly the horn word (not allowed to say it because of Metacritic's rules) teenage boy demographic, these sort of scenes are just plain awkward for people to sit through. Also, there is about 5 of these\runcomfortable sex scenes in this film, each lasting about 5 mins. Which means the total amount of time we spent watching some porno was just under 1/3 of the film.\r There are also these really weird scenes that don't go anywhere. They happen and then that's it.\r I wish there was a way that I could unsee this film and none of you get this film, even if you're curious, don' get it. I wish to never see Tommy Wiseau in anything again, if he even is in anything else and if he is, there's something wrong with this world."

It's pretty much like a porn movie without the porn, the conversations are completely non sense, crazy dialogues with zero speech tone, the acting is so bad that you can have some fun out of it. There a lot of sex sequences it the movie that last for many minutes and just for no reason and no meaning, at the beginning of the movie there are 2 sex scenes with the same woman with 2 different men that took like 10 minutes. Some dialogues are just dubbed after the movie in post production, and it sounds awful in the movie, cause it's easily noticeable the change of voice quality between studio and shooting, not to mention the lip movement that ends up getting very weird. I can feel that they tried to put some epic shots, wiht beautiful ambience and some nice music in the back, and it kind of works like how it's done, just not how it was suposed to. But it really makes you laugh and have some fun, that famous punch line followed by the \"hahaha\" that got me everytime. A terrible love triangle story that becomes a GREAT involuntary comedy.

Most bad movies are forgotten because of how forgettable they are, but The Room is so inept, so random, and so bizarre that it achieves cult-status at how horrible it was! It's kind of sad, because Tommy Wiseau did pour his heart and soul in this project. It just ended up being famous for all the wrong reasons.Worth watching with friends.

I'm pretty sure Tommy Wiseau had some sort of message about life and love that he wanted to give us. Maybe even one that was deep and insightful. It's impossible to tell though as the movie is incomprehensible.It runs on a loop of the characters having the same conversations over and over again with the occasional nonsensical moment or long, drawn out sex scene thrown in to break up the monotony. The dialog the cast was given is atrocious and they seem to be playing people who are only capable of making the dumbest possible decisions at any given moment. The acting isn't as bad as you would expect. With the exception of Sestero and Wiseau himself I actually thought there were some decent performances for a movie of this caliber. Sestero seems uninterested in really trying as a result of being fully aware of just how bad the project was going to turn out. Wiseau on the other hand is just a block of wood. Even his fits of rage seem devoid of energy.The direction and writing are just all around terrible. But rather than creating something that's painful to watch, Wiseau's ineptness both behind and in front of the camera inadvertently led to The Room becoming strangely lovable instead. It's still an awful movie, but at the same time it's hard to not be entranced by the unnatural interactions between everybody onscreen as it's all just too funny. As uncomfortable as the sex scenes are to watch I couldn't help but laugh. They have the corniest love songs playing overtop of them and Wiseau apparently doesn't know where the vagina is located. I couldn't tell is he was putting it between her breasts or just had some sort of weird bellybutton penetration fetish. The whole thing is a great source of unintentional hilarity. I'm not sure that's cause enough to recommend it though.1.3/10"

Worst actors, worst director, worst screenwriter, worst lighting, worst editing, worst cameramen, and poof! Genius.Nobody anywhere could ever make a worse movie no matter how hard they tried. In my humble opinion, that's why The Room is a monumental success.

Quality acting, directing, writing, cinematography, production design, and editing, are all left behind in this tale of love, deceit, and I am honestly not sure what else. While it delivers many laughs, it is at its own expense, as the comedy is to be found not in the quality comedic writing, but in the acting and horrendous dramatic writing. A serious film, this one could be mistaken to be a comedy if you did not know better. Really, the best quality brings to the table is an additional running joke for you to have with anybody you watch it with.

How can I avoid releasing a torrent of anger wrapped in objective criticism?The Room is perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen in my life and yes it is probably one of the worst in history, this movie is an argumentative and narrative vomit that lacks of all the basic rules of cinematic language, it is as disconnected as stupid and boring, is as unsuccessful as indescribable and lets say it, the background story of the script has a thematic full of clich\u00e9s but any screenwriter with some talent could have made something respectable from it, but Wiseau's script is a **** disaster. A **** disaster to which he gave a beginning and an ending but everything else is just crap.Believe me, unless you are someone like me who always finishes a movie or worse you enjoy it, I do not know how a regular audicence could find reasons or excuses to continue after the first twenty five minutes.And it's not only the lousy script or the bad direction, The Room is also plagued by such miserable performances that I cannot understand how they moved forward when they were editing. Everything looks neglected, false, overacted and most importantly, everything looks lost and out of focus, not only is the stupidity of the dialogues and the abandoned narrative threads, it's the way in which these things come out of the mouth of the actors. What was their motivation? I ignore it, maybe I should read the book or Franco's movie will throw some answers, otherwise it will remain an incredible mystery for me.Leaving aside the film a little, what concerns me now is what the film has become, because for those who do not know this movie is now considered a cult film, yes a cult film, with special screenings in which Wiseau finally has some success and hhe embrace it without any kind of reluctance, let's say that it was the success he longed for, but it's worth asking if it's valid to find success in mediocrity.Who are to blame for it? Who creates it or who consumes it? And don't get me wrong, I always advocate for what people enjoys or love, but you have to be able to draw a line, because if they convert this type of mediocrity into success what does it says about the spectators? What about the great films that are ignored annually and are condemned to the dark while this is the object of admiration and success? What do we aspire to? Failing in order to achieve fame by being a joke? Honestly with what I've seen in the trailers and the interviews, that's precisely what Franco is doing, maybe Wiseau ignores it or if he doesn't, he let it go, in one way or another the recognition is already his.Honestly, avoid it, stay away from The Room, there is nothing in it nor you will learn anything from it, it is a miserable movie, a crushing failure with all its letters, is bad and yes, not even the involuntary humor works for a ****"

Tommy Wiseau is one of those men who can produce, act, direct, and edit all at the same time on a godly level that no one had ever witnessed before now. His performance cemented himself as one of Hollywood's elites and made the already-great supporting cast even more enjoyable to watch. The plot is perfectly paced and varied, with all scenes coming together at the end for an impeccable finale. No talent is wasted or misdirected, and the dialogue is so hauntingly realistic that it makes it hard to believe that the actors were given a script to work off of. Overall this film gets a 9.9/10 from me, the only thing that is holding it back is that the 1.5 hour run time is just painfully short, and makes the film seem like only a snippet of what these talented people can really do."

I love the bit where Spagget spooks Johnny, and then cheeky Denny walks in while shoving a toaster where the sun don't shine. But then Lisa walks in because to bark at everyone, which satisfies Mark. But Saujanic is having none of it  and uses the speakeasy to kill Lisa, while simultaneously saying, \"BUT! BUT! BUT! SPEAKEASY!!!\" Then shortly afterwards, Naruto comes in and scopes Pingu, who is smoking a massive joint. But Robbie Rotten isn't having any of this either, and grabs Stephanie and Sportacus and hurls them at Denny. Deny iss deed. Jhnny rns ova tu hm nd shds a single tear."

The acting is wrong, the writing is wrong, the directing is wrong, but it makes this film so much of a laugh that it just catches me off guard every time with clips on Youtube, like the infamous flower shop scene or the part on the roof with Mark.    There isn't anything I can really say about this movie which hasn't already been said about it, but with friends this film is less of something to avoid, but something of near infinite hilarity, with moments so funny you will have to pause the movie just so you can watch it normally again, utterly laughable moments are almost constant too, not just the odd few clips you see around the web, the WHOLE movie is like this.    If you have some friends and stuff around, you cannot pass this movie up if they all find those little clips of the film funny, despite how bad it is, I would watch it with a group of friends any time, I would rate it lower for being an absolute abomination of a film, but its just so laughable that I can grant it a four."

This movie will take 10 years off of your life. This movie is a masterpiece and triumph in film-making. This movie is an unmitigated disaster. This movie is a blessing from God. This movie is a curse from Hell. I've seen The Room 33 times, and I honestly find new things to love/hate about it with every  watch. This movie is a BLAST to watch with friends, and I honestly highly recommend it! The flowershop scene alone defines modern cinema, and Tommy's greeting of \"Oh hai doggy\" will echo through time just like Citizen Kane's \"Rosebud...\""

The worst part about this film is that the director/star/executive producer/producer/writer Tommy Wiseau thinks he's making a modern masterpiece and I'm sure he is surprised that this didn't get Oscar attention. See this movie only to laugh at how horribly bad it is. If you don't like laughing at bad movies, burn every copy of the film you find."

In order to enjoy this movie, you honestly need to like this type of humor because if you watched this movie with a serious tone, of course it's gonna suck. It's so bad you'll love it.

To be honest, I would rate this film a 0, but I decided to give it a 10 because of it's laughable quality of satire. This movie without a doubt, is considered to be the greatest bad movie ever made."
