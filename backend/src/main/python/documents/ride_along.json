  "description": "For the past two years, high-school security guard Ben has been trying to show decorated APD detective James that he's more than just a video-game junkie who's unworthy of James' sister, Angela. When Ben finally gets accepted into the academy, he thinks he's earned the seasoned policeman's respect and asks for his blessing to marry Angela. Knowing that a ride along will demonstrate if Ben has what it takes to take care of his sister, James invites him on a shift designed to scare the hell out of the trainee. But when the wild night leads them to the most notorious criminal in the city, James will find that his new partner's rapid-fire mouth is just as dangerous as the bullets speeding at it.",

Ice Cube does a very solid job playing the straight man and for a few fleeting moments, this is a decent buddy comedy.\r The Bad: I don't expect a whole lot in regard to story from a film like this, but even still ... this movie was underwhelming in that regard. While Hart was funny, they leaned way too much on him and on occasion it went on too long and wasn't humorous anymore. The film's final act is a predictable dud. A very formulaic movie."

However, the movie's ending feels rushed and incomplete, and basically makes the rest of the movie feel as though it was there for nothing. A lot more could have been added to the movie; in fact, an additional 30 minutes could have been added to prevent the ending seeming as incomplete as it is."

Ice Cube wasn't acting the best this time but that's okay Kevin Hart made us look over the fact that cube wasn't on his game. It's definitely worth the time.

It's his goofy character that never stops talking that makes the movie worth watching, and easily makes up for the lackluster plot that is full of cop movie cliches and the surprisingly disappointing Ice Cube. So yeah if you're looking for some laughs Kevin Hart brings them. It's just a shame that the rest of the movie around him isn't so spectacular."

The sad thing about a film like this is that its rock-solid financial success will result in more Ride-Alongs when the first one wasn't even that good.  I'm not sure what this says about America's cultural appetite but I'll bet that it isn't healthy."

This movie was much better than staying at home and playing Call of Duty. Now I can go to the theater and watch actors pretend to play Call of Duty. All this while Ice Cube pretends to be a detective with no self control, and some forgotten actress pretends to be some borderline annoying clueless forgotten girlfriend/sister with a strange midget fetish. But hey its funny and your bored so what do you have to loose?"

The 40 minutes that do relate to the main plot just shows the audience how unoriginal this movie is , with its main mystery going to waste and the ending turning into useless mini-version of die hard providing a very unsatisfying ending.\rThe characters are cliche and consists of everyone you would expect in a typical cop buddy movie, a bad ass cop protective of his sister, the strict police commissioner who disapproves the bad ass cop, and the seemingly puny weak stupid guy who is in love with his sister and of course, some sort of uninteresting gang or cartel with its mystery leader. I would highly recommend anyone to not watch this movie."

Instead what is left is an unoriginal cliched plot filled with more jokes than real story. Although the chemistry of Ice Cube and Kevin Hart is good, Hart's manic demeanour becomes overbearing sometimes. The buddy cop genre is terribly cliched but a little more effort in story and characters would have gone a long way to making this a better film. Ride Along is a very undemanding piece of action entertainment so if I were you, I'd just ride along and not expect anything."

Ice Cube, however, sounds as if he's a franksenstinian amalgamation of cliche'd overworked cops that we've seen time and time again. The plot is clustered and unfocused, the relationship between Hart and Ice Cube makes little sense, starting off rough, as was intended, and follows through with that until the very end, with little to no form of development in between barring the insane amount of slapstick humour. The plot is clustered and non-sensical, and, unfortunately, even though the entire focus of the movie is the jokes, it fails at that miserably. I would only suggest this movie for any government agents looking for any viable torture techniques."

The only negative, to be honest, was Ice Cube. He seems to have regressed, if possible, as an actor and there were certain scenes that were just tough to watch without his mediocre acting breaking the immersion. All in all though, this is definitely a hilarious movie worth watching. As usual, the critics know nothing about comedy."

Nothing all that memorable or hilarious though."

Kevin Hart plays Ben Barber a security guard, who has tried to convince James (Ice Cube) that he is worthy of marrying James' sister Angela (Tika Sumpter). Ben is invited to the police academy, James decides to test his mettle by inviting him along on the shift designed to scare the trainee. Director Tim Story (Barber Shop, Think Like A Man and Fantastic Four) provides Hart and Cube some funny comedic landscape and Story does succeed by making it making it funny, but overall Hart and Cube would do better if they had a different director and had a better director instead Hart and Cube are trying to shine and make the script work also outshine the bad direction by Story. Laurence Fishbourne is good as the villain, also John Leguizamo is miss-cast."

The chemistry between cube and hart was pretty good but with a so,I'd script and director I think they could be great together.  It's very formulaic in the story structure, characters are not too deep (doesn't need to be in a comedy but depth still helps) as with most movies, especially comedies dumb things people say or act  that would never happen in real life do happen in the movie for the sole sake of moving the story forward. There's no real tension and I think it just comes from a weak script and the directing could have been miles better."

I don't easily laugh at old elements of comedy and I tend to look for something new so this movie disappointed me there. Another thing I want to say is not all the scenes are particularly captivating so expect lulls in the film.\r All in all, it gets a 6 because you'll get the laughs and who doesn't love a bit of cop-badguy action?\rWord to describe: Wandering, it's not as good as you think as it gets predicative so your mind will wander every once in a while.\rWatch it with some friends and it's okay to get the annoying movie friend to come because it's a comedy. Even the annoying movie friends deserve to laugh a bit."
