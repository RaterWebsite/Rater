And while it's all told in a pretty straightforward manner, it's nonetheless very compelling, and the performances from all involved are terrific! Overall, while it's a formulaic biopic in some ways, and with some important details about the true story that I noticed were left out, the film's clever editing, standout performances from everybody, particularly the three leads, and the all-around importance and urgency of the story make it a very worthwhile watch."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Exponentially more troubling than it is as breezy or as cheeky as its promotional material may lead you to believe it is, \"Bombshell\" is a good, but not great film that suffers from the tragedy of existentiality, albeit slightly. Being a movie that's based on such a well-publicized and recent event automatically amps up the chances of the narrative losing weight, lulling the audience into a trance-like state of, \"oh, yeah I remember this\" and \"yep, here comes this part.\" And, though it may not be saying or revealing a whole of new information to the audience, it helps that the events are so unflinchingly depicted, creating this inescapably horrific, cloud of uncomfortability for the audience to soak up in the theater. Some of the scenes border on just downright hard to watch -- in the right and most necessary way. The acting checks out, featuring a trio of committed performances, bolstered by convincing efforts from the hair and makeup department.

For the most part, I found this a worthwhile offering, serving up a probing look at a troubling story that effectively mixes cynicism, satire and serious drama in examining a serious workplace matter that often isn't taken seriously enough.

Frankly, I don't understand what disappointed viewers expected out of this release, but I find their criticisms misplaced, suggesting that \"Bombshell\" should have somehow handled this material in a way that it wasn't intended to be handled in the first place, an unfair disparagement if you ask me -- and one this film doesn't deserve."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "It wasn't a bombshell, it was more like a scratch.Don't get the wrong idea, it wasn't bad but at all times it felt like a measured and tamed story."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Simplesmente amei o longa.

Given that this is about a pretty unpleasant subject matter, director Jay Roach (who started off in comedy with such films as Austin Powers and Meet the Parents) made perhaps the wise decision to try not to go too dark. There is a more of a focus on the female leads efforts within and against Fox News, trying not to define the women merely with what was done to them, and a darkly humorous look at a the company culture. A lot of exposition in the first third is is presented in a pretty audience-friendly manner.Understand that when I say that things don't get too depressing that that doesn't mean the harassment is sugarcoated. The scenes that address this are emotionally striking with how awful the whole thing is. The movie is also pretty nuanced and three-dimensional in depicting the people involved and the situations.My one issue is that a little too much specific factoids are spoken directly to the audience. However given that a movie criticizing conservative Fox News is a politically taut situation, I can see why the filmmakers want to demonstrate that they weren't being sloppy with their presentation of the events.The cast is all around great. You'll probably be surprised by some of the faces that pop up here. Charlize Theron and Nicole Kidman are great in this. John Lithgow delivers one of the best roles of his career as Roger Ailes, managing to portray a loathsome creep while also making it seem natural how he manages to command loyalty among his employees and allies.This is a well done film and I recommend this."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "It\u2019s nearly impossible to address a topic like sexual harassment while avoiding taking a point of view.  By trying to maintain a fair and balanced perspective, \u201cBombshell\u201d remains frustratingly superficial on a topic that deserves much deeper exploration.This film examines the end of the Roger Ailes era at Fox News, a period during which anchor Gretchen Carlson sued the network for sexual harassment when she was fired.  After the suit was announced, the film depicts on-air-personality Megyn Kelly\u2019s internal debate on whether to go public about her own brushes with Ailes.Director Jay Roach (\u201cTrumbo,\u201d the Austin Powers series) and Writer Charles Randolph (\u201cThe Big Short\u201d) have created a film with an uneven, confusing tone.  In \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d Randolph\u2019s script relied heavily on voiceovers, actors speaking directly to the camera and excellent use of humor (Margot Robbie in a bubble bath explaining sub-prime mortgages is one of the funniest vignettes of the past few years).  Here, deploying the same techniques just seems out of place - dressing an actor to look like Geraldo Rivera is guaranteed to cause a brief smile, but it\u2019s a cheap laugh that\u2019s simply distracting.  When addressing a subject like sexual harassment, so weighted with profound personal emotional cost, the superficial jokes and visual humor just seem painfully out of place.The core cast contributes almost entirely to whatever success the film does achieve.  As central character Megyn Kelly, Charlize Theron (with the help of facial prostheses) does an eerie imitation of her real-life counterpart\u2019s appearance, gait and style of speaking.  As Gretchen Carlson, Nicole Kidman relies less on visual similarity but still effectively conveys the essence of her character.  As Kayla, who represents a composite of real-life female employees at Fox, Margot Robbie is compelling as she struggles with the compromises she\u2019s willing to make to \u201cmove to the head of the line\u201d and become an on-air reporter.  Robbie offers the most powerful scene of the film as she second-guesses with considerable anguish the choices she\u2019s made.  John Lithgow (as Ailes) is powerfully effective as a self-absorbed bully.The creative team has an amazing supporting cast at its disposal - Kate McKinnon as a Fox employee who\u2019s a closeted gay Democrat, Allison Janney, Alice Eve, Rob Delaney, Richard Kind (Rudy Giuliani) and Mark Duplass, among others.  It\u2019s no small irony that two males, Delaney and Duplass, are the most sympathetic, thoughtful and appealing people in the film.\u201cBombshell\u201d shows several major flaws and raises several major questions.  First, the screenplay totally fails to explore how, if at all, the inward-looking culture at Fox New contributed uniquely to an environment where serial sexual harassment could thrive.  Instead, the script settles for portraying facts from the public record with no real attempt at context or interpretation.  Second, the central characters are generally unsympathetic.  Megyn Kelly, in particular, appears so driven by her own ambition that she seems oblivious to the situations of women around her.  Her early comment \u201cI\u2019m not a feminist.  I\u2019m a lawyer.\u201d offers only the laziest of explanations.    Third, there is no serious exploration of why women, informally, didn\u2019t help other women avoid Ailes\u2019 predations.  For me, one of the most intriguing but inscrutable characters in the film is Holland Taylor (she was Charlie Sheen\u2019s mother on \u201cTwo and a Half Men,\u201d more notably Ann Richards in the one-woman-show \u201cAnn\u201d on Broadway) in a totally uncredited role.  In multiple scenes, you see Taylor smiling knowingly as she ushers the latest young woman in a short skirt into Ailes\u2019 inner sanctum, fully aware of what is in store once the door closes and locks.  Finally, totally separate from the Fox News context, is this bland approach to harassment what\u2019s always going to happen when the #MeToo movement is written, directed and packaged by men?If you want a deeper understanding of Roger Ailes and his legacy, read the carefully-documented \u201cThe Loudest Voice in the Room,\u201d by Gabriel Sherman.  \u201cBombshell,\u201d on the other hand, is a superficial glossing-over of an essential topic and an insular culture that deserve a much more thorough examination."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This is not a summation of the complexity and depth of sexual harassment.

Going into the movie, everyone needs to be aware that it is largely told from the three female leads perspectives. It is not an anti Fox News movie, but tells the story of Theron, Kidman, and Robbie's characters experience at Fox News. The movie deals with many major stories from 2015 and 16 and contains many Fox News figures past and present. It relies on viewers knowing who they are for those scenes to really sink in. I think the film could have sunk deeper into the culture at Fox News and why so many people were unwilling to defect on Roger Ailes. Conservatives in general are quick to defend white male figures who are accused of harassment and continue to support a president who has been accused of sexual indecency by over a dozen women.

Well, she did I still go and today I saw a performance by Charlize Theron that might not get her that second Oscar but she, along with Nicole Kidman and Margot Robbie, certainly deserve nominations. (Robbie stands a chance in the supporting category as the other two have won best actress Oscars.)I honestly did not recognize Theron until the near end of the movie due to makeup and prosthetics---another Oscar nomination?--and she has lowered her voice that she is Megyn Kelly. Though the film revolves around Theron/Kelly, for those who don't know the whole story, it was Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman) who was responsible, not only for the downfall of Roger Ailes (John Lithgow) but helped bring the #METOO movement to the forefront.As with all 'based on a true story' I often wonder how true private conversations are but this man was so abusive that you know a lot wasn't being told and it boggles the mind what he did do and what he, and other men, got away with. The fact that many women covered up for him and one seems to be a pimp for him, doesn't bring any shame on them but on the industry for their practices regarding women.Any film dealing with the politics in the past 5 years will have to involve Trump and Fox News but, even if we see the behind the scenes involving the Murdochs, this is not a Republican versus Democrat movie. There is a reason why the 3 leads, and so many others, are beautiful blondes wearing tight and short dresses and showing their legs and it all points to Ailes, and Fox, allowing him to do what he did because he was making the company billions of dollars.Aside from Theron, Kidman and Robbie there are many name actresses such as Holland Taylor, Kate McKinnon, Allison Janney and Connie Britton playing large, small and all important parts.Lithgow is a repulsive looking man as Ailes--again makeup and prosthetics--making it so unimaginable that he could get any woman that he wanted sexually but he does because of the way the industry worked. Richard Kind does a quick impersonation of Rudy Giuliani while Malcolm McDowell plays Rupert Murdoch and various actors play well known TV figures.The screenplay by Charles Randolph holds your attention no matter how familiar you may be with the story while director Jay Roach keeps the film going at a quick pace.\"Bombshell\" is a must see for the performances, the story and getting out to all the public exactly what brought the #METOO movement forward.

Wish I could unwatch this so called movie."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "A highly topical film with a stand out cast, the three central performances by Theron, Kidman and Robbie are reason enough to see Bombshell.Bombshell is heavily based on a real scandal against Fox News head Roger Ailes (John Lithgow) and the toxic atmosphere he presided over at the network. It follows three women working at Fox News, Megyn Kelly (Charlize Theron), Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman) and Kayla Pospisil (Margot Robbie). As with all \"based on true events\" movies one has to be aware that certain creative liberties will always be at play. Yes the main plot details will hopefully be accurate but everything around that is up for debate. It's best not to dwell on that as it may hinder your enjoyment of the film itself. In one way you will be entertained watching Bombshell with its snappy dialogue, hoping to get a few laughs from you. But keep in the mind the subject matter. It flips from one end of the spectrum to the other very quickly and there are a couple of scenes that are shocking and very uncomfortable to watch. John Lithgow is absolutely vile as Roger Ailes. I do mean that as a compliment, his performance is so convincing it will make your skin crawl. Lithgow and Theron's transformation into their characters is very impressive and credit has to be given to the prosthetic makeup designer, Kazu Hiro. There are a lot of good contenders among the Makeup and Hairstyling Oscar nominees this year but Bombshell deserves to win.Bombshell does highlight the toxic environment of the news network and you'll feel two very strong emotions when watching it. Empathy towards the women, which is only enhanced by the superb acting from the cast and anger towards the harmful work environment and severe lack of repercussions to these high up sexual predators abusing their positions of power. Although I can't fault the acting from anyone I'm not sure Bombshell is making the grand statement it thinks it's making. It doesn't shy away from the allegations against Ailes but other than that it doesn't really deal with the issues it has raised. Has anything really changed? I didn't have a high opinion of Fox News and Bombshell doesn't do a whole lot to change that. It also feels like it's trying to empower women yet it doesn't exactly achieve that either. It's an appropriate film and suitable for today's climate, I only wish it had tried to be less like a comedy and delve deeper into the subject matter. Regardless it's still worth your time and recommended."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Pretty much everyone knows the story behind Fox New president Roger Ailes and his serial harrassment of potential reporters and anchors at the network.

Director Jay Roach continually uses close-ups to probe the paranoia.

The film tells the story of three women at Fox News - Megyn Kelly (Charlize Theron), who becomes embroiled in controversy when she asks Donald Trump about his history of misogyny; Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman) who is fired from the channel, having already complained about sexist treatment in 2013, and who now plans to sue president Roger Ailes (John Lithgow), who she claims sexually harassed her for years; and research assistant Kayla Pospisil (Margot Robbie playing a composite character) who learns what Ailes means when he says he will need evidence of her \"loyalty\".Written by Charles Randolph and directed by Jay Roach, Bombshell's depiction of the nature of sexual harassment in a corporate arena that's male-dominated and female-enabled is chillingly effective, with the film depicting an environment in which women are victims whether they resist or submit to sexual advances \u2013 resist, and they risk their job; submit, and they lose their self-respect.At the same time, Roach is not trying to examine the monolithic political ideology of Fox News itself. Sure, it features lines such as Ailes claiming, \"news is like a ship, you take your hands off the wheel and it pulls hard to the left\", whilst Pospisil is told the main goal of the channel is to \"frighten and titillate\", but these are the exceptions. Instead, the film is about self-loathing, fear, and anxiety \u2013 it's about workplace bullying and the human cost of sexual harassment, and part of the film's point is that politics are irrelevant \u2013 sexual harassment is sexual harassment, and your politics, religious beliefs, race, and gender are all beside the point.Something that works especially well is the triptych narrative structure. It's not an even divide (this is Kelly's film before it is Carlson's or Pospisil's), but it does allow Roach to dramatise how much Ailes looks on his female staff as commodities. Carlson is the washed-up former beauty queen who no longer holds his interest; Kelly is the current flavour of the month; Pospisil is the future, young, vital, keen, and in awe of the man himself, as all women should be \u2013 for every Carlson, there's a Kelly to replace her, and for every Kelly, there's a Pospisil ready for grooming.From an acting perspective, Theron is extremely impressive. Normally, she looks nothing like Kelly, but through posture, mannerisms, wardrobe, voice, and the subtle prosthetic genius of Kazu Hiro, the actress disappears into the character in a deeply impressive performance that transcends mere imitation. The other standout is Lithgow, whose performance is fascinatingly modulated. He initially portrays Ailes as a flawed human being, and it's only later that he lets the monster out of the box, in a horrifying scene in which he asks an increasingly uncomfortable Pospisil to hike her skirt higher and higher, to the point where her underwear is showing, as he becomes increasingly aroused, indicated by nothing but his breathing. It's a nauseating scene which gets to the film's core \u2013 Ailes knows that if women like Pospisil value their job, they'll submit, just as they have done for men like him throughout history; as he sees it, ambitious women will always need powerful men.As for problems, the film is probably too silent on some of Kelly's history. I understand that Roach wants to avoid anything resembling victim-blaming. But if you knew nothing about these events, you'd think the only controversy Kelly ever encountered at Fox was asking Trump about misogyny. There's no mention, for example, of her infamous \"Jesus was a white man\" comment from 2013. Granted, it doesn't have much to do with the story at hand, but my point is a general one. The film's Kelly is almost virginal, without blemish. Interestingly, the film does address that Kelly knew about Ailes for years before Carlson was fired, and it takes her to task for not doing anything with that knowledge. However, after she watched the film, the real Kelly cited this scene as an example of victim-blaming \u2013 make of that what you will.Certainly, the opportunity for Kelly to explain why she stayed silent for so long is available, but is never availed of. But is that a fault of the filmmakers or a reflection on the actual person's reluctance to take that journey inward? Sure, the film is at pains to avoid showing either Carlson or Kelly as in any way complicit in creating the hideously outdated patriarchy at Fox. But this is by design. Were Bombshell a story about Fox News, such things ought to be examined. But it isn't. It's a story about humiliation and bullying, a story that says people do not deserve such treatment, no matter their race, religion, or politics."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Bombshell Goes BustThe Stream: Nothing new that you didn\u2019t already know or suspect.The Big Screen: Charlize Theron\u2019s uncanny resemblance to Megyn Kelly is a remarkable feat.The Final Bill: A star-studded TV movie on the big screen.-Trip FontaineIn the colloquial sense, people and things can be described as a bombshell. Catastrophic news can be a bombshell; or, an attractive woman may be characterized as a bombshell. Most likely, you have heard the term \u201cblonde bombshell\u201d \u2013 get it? Whatever. Okay, Jay Roach\u2019s Bombshell plays with those connotations in alluding to the revelation of rampant sexual harassment at Fox News as well as the numerous, mostly blonde employees of the network. The titular bombshell was reported in 2016 when Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson exposes then CEO Roger Ailes and the toxic culture at the network, so the history is very recent. I would suspect anyone going to see Bombshell will mostly be curious about the star-studded cast because they would already know the basics of the story. There really isn\u2019t much more to it.Nicole Kidman plays a fierce and steadfast, Gretchen Carlson. She\u2019s tired of the \u201cboy\u2019s club\u201d antics of her co-anchors and the disregard she is shown by Roger Ailes, who is played by John Lithgow under layers of makeup. I think Kidman is made up to resemble Carlson, and it\u2019s a good job because she looks like herself but not unrecognizable. Carlson is out on a limb when she goes against Ailes by exposing him and Fox News, but she needs allies.The remainder of the film is basically grappling with whether any other women related to Fox News will tell their stories. The primary focus is on Megyn Kelly played by Charlize Theron and a composite character, Kayla Pospisil, played by Margot Robbie. Theron is unrecognizable. She looks so much like Megyn Kelly and sounds like her too that it is mindboggling. Her performance is really good although it doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s much at stake for Kelly. She seems pretty insulated from any potential fallout whether she supports Carlson or not. Robbie is very good as well. Because her character is fictionalized, she doesn\u2019t come with the baggage of Megyn Kelly or Gretchen Carlson and gets to be the ambitious, young wide-eyed fool who wants to work at Fox News and naively trusts these people she idolizes. Robbie gets to be tender and devastating in her own right.It is hard to be spoiler free on Bombshell because we lived these events so recently or you can just go to your trusty internet search engine and read the articles for yourself. I ask, does the film justify its existence? The cast does a good job. There are a lot of cameos throughout of the other Fox News personalities \u2013 Geraldo, Judge Jeanine, Greta, etc. The make-up is great \u2013 just look at Theron in one clip. The film as a whole feels like the other political retellings that have come out as of late, mostly on HBO, Recount, Game Change and last year\u2019s theatrical release, Vice, but there\u2019s really no deeper point of view about any of these characters or the situation. I do not know that this movie is necessary now \u2013 aside from depicting that women working in the conservative news field endured their #MeToo moments as well.The only real reason to see Bombshell is to watch Charlize Theron, Nicole Kidman and Margot Robbie in these performances. They are all great, but the first teaser for Bombshell (the 3 women in the elevator and that suspenseful music) was the most impactful part of the film. If you really want to know what happened, read the articles from only 3 years ago. Save the viewing of the movie to when it premieres on HBO next year or whenever, if you must see it."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "this movie is great. really brings to light what happens behind the scenes. people say it hates on men, but here's the thing. if it don't apply, let it fly. but if it stings, then maybe it was supposed to sting. if you assume that an instance of sexual harassment is an attack on men, then that says more about you than the movie."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Quite a good film about the goings-on at Fox News during the last years of executive Roger Ailes.
