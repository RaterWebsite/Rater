The thing about reviewing Comedy is its so subjective - either you find it funny or you don't. In this case, I'm in the camp of the former. One of my favourite comedy movies of all time, and definitely a benchmark against which other parodies should be measured."

      "text": "Scary Movie (2000) is the first film in the \"Scary Movie\" parody series that revolves around making fun of what was originally just horror movies, but eventually by the time of the 3rd part, features other movies that were not horror. Scary Movie is a very memorable film to me, and really showed what a true spoof is. To me, this film is up there with Airplane! and Spaceballs. The film has non stop humor much like Naked Gun, while having characters that you actually care about and have some development. Directed and written by the Wayans brothers, who also act as main characters in the movie, this film received an R rating, as did the second film. However, 3-5 were directed by different people and received the PG-13 rating, giving them less freedom. Scary Movie was actually a box office hit, making a few hundred million dollars. Acting isn't too bad in this film, and you are constantly entertained. As a bonus, the main antagonist, Ghostface, taken from the popular 90's horror franchise Scream, has some very funny scenes where he interacts with other minor characters. All in all, this is a great spoof movie with an actual story, that is entertaining with decent cinematography and puns. Overall, I give thus film a 8/10."

The fact that the franchise managed to go downhill from here is quite frankly staggering.\rIt is all very well spoofing another movie (The Hot Shots movies were largely successful at doing this) but it needs to be done with some level of intelligence. Simply copying scenes from well known movies, in this case mainly Scream and adding in a few rude jokes is not clever or funny. In fact the writers of Scary Movie seem to have completely missed the point of Scream, which was itself already a send up of horror movie conventions.\r Avoid at all costs."

      "text": "Even spoof movies deserve a few good jokes. For the most part the humour in Scary Movie is obvious, inept and crude. We get it Wayans Brothers and co. you've seen Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, The Blair Witch Project and scores of other films - so why do you fail so completely in writing clever gags referencing them? There are a couple of moments I must admit that I laughed at, and the Usual Suspects homage and some of the Scream nods raise the odd smile, and Anna Farris works rather well as a goofy comedy performer. Beyond providing some mild amusement, however, Scary Movie is pretty awful. Clumsy direction, lazy performances, uneven story pacing, in addition to a quite grating overall feel of buffoonery drive the film into the ground. A Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker parody film this is not - it's simply not smart enough. It's merely a poor imitation, both of the aforementioned comedy trio's landmark spoof films, but of the films that Scary Movie itself chooses to spoof."

I still have the same thought about it in Scream, but it's more clear here than ever. I mean my God this is so pathetic. It is the antithesis of what I look for in any film: likeable characters, a point, being interesting overall, and visually pleasing. Not only are the actors bad in this, but they're so annoying. There's no settle moments; sure I'll laugh maybe once in a while, but I feel like shot afterwards. The point of this film is to only cash in, there's no other fricking reason for this to exist. I think this could be done well; the idea of parodying a parody is somewhat interesting, but this is the completely wrong way of doing it."

The infantile humour is getting annoying as the movie progresses. Profanity and fifth-grader tiltillation is no replacement for what brought the movie down most in my opinion: a dire lack of wit in the dialogue. And by that I mean the British definition (look it up). This is probably the only good movie from the Wayanses before they lost their funny and went desperate, aka: cluttering up movies with subpar spoofs of everything under the sun. This is the only one where the subpar and good parodies are in equal number. For the rest, it's a needle in a haystack. This is probably because... well... they didn't write it. Which begs the question. Why is it that when \"Scary Movie\" was directed by David Zucker (I still admire the guy for the sheer comedy of \"Airplane\" and \"Naked Gun\"), it still blew? Maybe the Wayanses wrote that one."

Each sequel got worse and worse. With 5 movies this is an achievement that I don't think I can archive willingly (Maybe I am exaggerating because I am incompetent in movie making, but not as much as it should be). But back to this movie: It is a parody of different horror movies, mainly Scream with side jokes for Blair Witch Project, Sixth Sense, American Pie, Matrix and more. The humor / jokes in the movie work really well and play with the stupidity,  stereotypes and tropes of Horror Movies. For me >90% of all jokes are funny. The Actors are well chosen for their roles and deliver the stereotypes and their jokes very well. I don't think I should rate the story for itself in a spoof movie that can completely tracked to another movie. I will rate the humor and creativity instead which is a win for this movie. Overall a movie worth watching but not in the Top 10 for spoof movies. Special warning! Like I said each sequel got worse. Stay away as far as possible from the Sequels especially from 4 and 5."

      "text": "This adolescent film (one of the most abominable cinematographic genres) was made to mock some well-known horror films. The clearest victim was Wes Craven's film \"Scream\", but if we pay attention we will see scenes that satirize other films such as \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\", \"Blair Witch Project\" or \"Sixth Sense\". Interestingly (or perhaps not so much), the working title of \"Scream\" was \"Scary Movie\" and the studio responsible for the two films is the same: Dimension Films. Talking about the plot here would be not only redundant, but it seems to me a mistake: by mentioning the most spoofed films here, I think I have already left enough clues about the plot. Whoever wants to know more, please go see the film.The film is a satire, it was made to entertain, and it is clearly aimed at young audiences, so it is better not to be expecting something complex or a dramatic show. This is not a movie designed to win Oscars or anything like that. It is a film to make people laugh, for the easy laugh of teenagers who don't think much, love eschatological humor or suffer from a serious obsession with everything related to sexuality. But that does not mean that it is a bad or abominable film, as many teen films really are. In fact, it turned out to be a pleasant film, one that you can't revisit often or make us laugh out loud (although it varies from one person to another) but it will put some smiles in the most circumspect audiences. For me, the film has both good and bad things: I don't like such an immoral humor, but it is impossible not to laugh at some situations. Parodying horror films also helps, although the choice of these films is debatable.The cast is led by Anna Faris, and she does a satisfying job, just as Regina Hall and Jon Abrahams, Marlon Wayans and Shawn Wayans are decent enough, but do not exceed the average. Carmen Electra does not work well as an actress, she appears only to show her generous cleavage whenever necessary, and Shannon Elizabeth is not much better than her. But the one who really does badly in this film is Dave Sheridan, thanks to the horrible and offensive character that happened to him. There is a limit between being politically incorrect and being offensive, and the character Duffy overcomes that limit by the insulting way in which he portrays a mentally retarded man. And it's not even worth mentioning the fact that this character is annoying and not funny at all."
