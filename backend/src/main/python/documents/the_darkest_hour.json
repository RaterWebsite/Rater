I just always watch Independence Day and Mars Attacks! I like Emile Hirsch when he was Speed Racer, but the characters from The Darkest Hour is more stupider than Jack and Jill was and they don't even know what they say. The action of the movie is wasted too much time in about a minute or so and the script is a mess. Who needs Battle Los Angeles when you need 'em? Forget about renting on DVD or crappy 3-D versions, this is an absurd title with a made-for-TV monologue. \"The Darkest Hour\" is pretty dark and pretty damn boring. One of the worst movies of the year. They had their hour, but when the lights are out, it's game over!"

Moscow is shown very well, with famous city locations.The performances are regular to bad, and full of clich\u00c3\u00a9s. The story isinteresting at the start, but in the final third of the film moves abit from the original focus, and the explanation of the invaders wasvery strange and forced - not to mention it has a hook for a sequel,wide open.It's a good movie to watch without expectations, but nothing more thanthis (or to showcase your new 3D HDTV) - the movie is worth for theimages of Moscow and its beginning. My score: 6.0 / 10.0."

      "text": "The plot: aliens invade, everybody dies, some survive and find way to fight back, the end. So not much story there, it is 'explained' very shortly why the aliens are there but it's one of the classic reasons so not much creativity in the plot. The 'novelty' here is that the aliens are invisible (a bit like those in Final Fantasy - Spirits Within) but power up electric stuff as they pass it (lamps, cars, cellphones,...) so our heros have to move by night instead of day (inverse of zombie flicks). If the aliens kill someone they evaporate to dust (like in War of the Worlds) and the night look of the film reminds me somewhat of Cloverfield. So they stole from a lot of other good movies but it's not nearly as good as any of them. Some of the heros die, but you won't care much coz the acting isn't great. The VFX are okay for it's budget but we've all seen better. With all that said, it's not as bad a movie as you would think. If found it enjoyable as light entertainment so if you set your expectations low enough you can give your brain 90 mins of braindead fun."

The special effects were on the level of a made-for-TV-movie on the sci-fi channel. The 3D was needless because there was nothing enhanced since the special effects and the aliens were practically non-existent. I would advise to save your money and time and stay home and watch a good sci-fi dvd. This movie would have appealed to children from 10-15 years old, with absolutely no knowledge of what constituents a good movie experience, plot or special effects. When it was finally over, I wished that I could have gotten my time and/or money back."

And even then, they rarely answer the question \"why\". \"let's go this way, because this that and the other\"... and why does that matter? And beyond that, it didn't even spend that time developing any of the 5-6 main characters more than \"I have a family somewhere else in the world who I'm wondering if survived!\" and, about the special effects stuff, the only thing it really had to offer, were some cool death scenes, and one or two cool landscapes (the one involving the airplane was rather cool). Everything else was either dull or silly looking... If you are absolutely dying to see this movie, wait until it's on Netflix so the only thing you're wasting is the hour and a half spent watching the movie. :P"

The acting was laughable and there was one cheesy speech after another, but my dad and i watch the primetime scifi channel movies every saturday night, so we have experience with these movies, and we love them. I really enjoyed this movie because i went into it with the right mindset. Expect it to be terrible and still give it a slight chance and you won't be disappointed. They definitely did the whole invisible alien concept really well, and the special effects were pretty nice at times, but as always with a cheesy scifi flick, like i said before the acting was a complete joke, but i enjoyed this movie. If you go into the theater expecting a really good alien invasion film with suspense and terror and a solid cast, then don't bother, but if you enjoy a laughable and cheesy film, then this is a must-see, i enjoyed myself. 6.5/10"

This translates into a movie that might just be different and strange enough to keep westerners engaged even though the movie has some pretty weak parts. Character development does'nt always make sense, there were a few people that seemed interesting and worthwhile at the beginning that just lose all speaking lines at a certain point and simply hang around making stupid decisions until the inevitable death. The unmasked aliens look pretty ridiculous."

But what I must point out is the length of film is always important to note - I felt it was too short to hold my attention. I wanted to know more. As it was quite short, it is also useful to illustrate the pacing, as it realised it had to skip certain areas, rushing in order to make the 85-90 minute time limit. The beginning normally needs to either fill us in properly on background detail or give us time to develop it during the disaster. Although this did happen throughout the film, we did get a little background detail of some of the main characters. What made this film not sink into bad territory was the continued update of the journey to escape from the electric creatures, which I thought were awesome. It was quite courageous to use them as the mainspring in this film, as it was obvious in this situation that it was a devastating attack. It was amazing to see the characters start to rely on each other in such dire need and that rescue came when it was most needed."

The critics seemed to like him so much, heaping praise for his 'innovation'.  However, his higher budgeted pictures felt amateurish at best.  The Darkest Hour started pretty good, but felt so unsatisfying and derivative of every Alien invasion film that you felt cheated in the end.   If you want an Indie genre director that really delivers, wait for Neil Blonkamp's (District 9's) next features."

Emile Hirsch is one of the most underrated young actors in all of Hollywood and Olivia Thirlby holds her own. And I'm a huge fan of Rachael Taylor. I hope she gets more and more chances to shine because she could be the next Cameron Diaz. She was great in the short-lived remake of Charlie's Angels and I see she's going to have a new show on TV this fall. As for the actual aliens, I actually really liked the concept used in this film. It wasn't the same old regurgitated idea from every other alien-invasion film before it. It uses a refreshing idea that creates an enemy that rivals any in terms of hopelessness. There were some plot holes and some aspects that were because of low-budget issues but overall, this film was very good and doesn't deserve the shortsighted criticisms many people have given it."

This is an alien invasion theme, but slightly different than those similar films. It never gives the reason, just the destructions like apocalypse on its way. That means it is about the survival. A group of Americans who are in the Moscow for different reasons joins the hands after people started to turn into ashes with the contact of the strange electric mist that came from the sky. So what's their plan now and whether they get out of it safely or not focused on the remaining film.Surely some people would enjoy it. It's not all bad if you are not expecting a masterpiece. I should have seen it in digital 3D for a better experience, even the normal watch is not that bad. The turns in the story were unpredictable, particularly the film characters, but the twist wasn't. They kept the open ending, and you know why is that. I liked the performances, not individually, but the overall everyone, including the Russians.The film was also shorter, which means fast moving tale. The graphics were okay, especially those electric mist thing, but disappointed for not show the aliens other than for fractions of seconds during the fightbacks.

I'm looking at you 'Battleship'. No burrito references in sight either. No tit-fest for 15 year old boys. Clever female protagonists. Inventive and a breath of fresh air in the most tired and cliche ridden of US genres. A low budget film shows how it might be done if LA studios only had a brain.
