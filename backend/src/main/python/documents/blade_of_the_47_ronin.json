It feels like more than half of the movie is missing, and the story, in fact, THE WHOLE MOVIE would have been a lot better if the fantasy elements were removed, and it stuck to telling the true story. Also, the character with the skeleton tattoo who was so prominently featured in the advertising? HE ISN'T EVEN IN THE MOVIE! It's utterly terrible. Keanu Reeves is the one saving grace of this film, however."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "The poor reviews from both critics and users are misguided; this was an excellent telling of a 300 year old legend, the Chushingura. The legend is based on a historical battle, and the multitude of versions of the Chushingura all tweak some element of the historical events in order to either feature a certain element, actor, or viewpoint. This movie does the same thing.\r The dialog is in keeping with typical Japanese historical/fantasy action movies--it's direct, stoic in manner, and yet expressive. All of the actors deliver their lines believably and with grace--much as one should expect from this story. Keanu Reaves, while the Hollywood A-lister, is not the focus, but his strengths lend themselves well to the story. The real stars are Hiroyuki Sanada as Oishi, Tadanobu Asano as Lord Kira, and Rinko Kikuchi as Mizuki--the three of them are the heart and soul of the movie, and the plot moves with them. The action is swift, clean, and beautiful, which shouldn't be a surprise given the level of talent in the film. The CG adds only the fantasy elements, and doesn't detract from the rest of the story.\r The love story between Lady Mika and Kai is the twist of this story, and it works well because it's not the central focus of the plot. It's a nice addition, one to get American female audiences involved, no doubt.\r Overall, I'm highly satisfied with this movie. The only reason I don't give it a 10/10 is because, for me, that rating is reserved for the most epic of movies. \"47 Ronin\" isn't epic, but it's definitely excellent."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "\"I didn't ask you to build me a watch, I only asked what time it was.\"  Seems this is very true for this particular film: Critics want to deconstruct it down to every nuance while making sure to factor in the original cost, how the CGI compares to other films, etc.  What so many people, including critics, seem to forget is that most people go to the movies for entertainment.  They don't care if the movie cost $1 or $1 billion to make.  They don't care if the CGI wasn't as good as XYZ film or if a particular piece of dialogue wasn't great  they simply want to be entertained for a couple hours.  If it was widely publicized that it was made for only $40,000 would people have then said what a remarkable achievement it was?\r 47 Ronin was a big surprise in that sense as it simply didn't disappoint as so many said it would.   Indeed, we bought our 3D tickets before we read any reviews and started regretting the purchase before even seeing the film.  We finally decided to go ahead with what was sure to be a terrible movie ticket investment  four hardcore movie watchers who can generally be pretty objective when it comes to movies.   As it turned out, the movie was entertaining in virtually every respect.\r Was it a great movie?  Not necessarily, but it was good and certainly worth the ticket price.  The story had a few lulls but none that inspired a \"this is probably a good time to go to the bathroom\" moment.  The CGI was fine for 99% of the population, possibly excepting graphics designers and hardcore video game players.  The dialogue was fine for 99% of the population, possibly excepting writers or professional speakers.\r Instead, this movie entertained right from the start and had a plot line that followed just fine.  Sure, sure, perhaps a couple \"roll your eyes\" romantic moments but that is no major sin.  The action scenes were good with a couple very minor \"huh?\" spots.  The ending wasn't my cup of tea, but would seem to hold true with the storyline and the samurai code of that day.  But hey, how many people in the US are well-versed in those ancient traditions?  Probably less than 1%.  Which again leaves it as a satisfying film for the other 99% of us."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Wow. I am shocked by the bad critic reviews.

I think it is an intentional nod to traditional Japanese form, but what do I know?\r Frankly this movie reminded me of one of the \"Lord of the Rings\" movies, Japanese style. It is a complete and intriguing universe. The cinematography and artistic direction feel coherent and well conceived.

The CGI was well used. The emotion never seemed forced and the moments of humor were well-placed. The only thing this movie needed was some extended story and screen fight time with some of the characters on the fringes (the giant suit of armor guy and the pirate skeleton guy in particular).

It's OK, but not the star among holiday films:  Pedestrian, effects-laden, fantastical retelling of a Japanese legend with fluent English by the mostly Japanese cast so no subtitles needed.  One of those films that makes you wonder what happened to that Ted Logan we grew up on all charm and spewing catchphrases?  What process of maturing turned Keanu Reeves into this stone-faced, emotionless guy?  With few spoken lines and just the expressions on their faces, the rest of the cast could communicate tragedy, malevolence, or pride, but our half-breed is so lacking in personality that the actor who played his younger version could infuse his small part of the script with more feeling.

The opening dialogue just repeated what you were already seeing. This is not a character movie but a plot movie that cultures which value the group over the individual would enjoy more.

What really drove me crazy was that leaders don't have to be responsible for their bad decisions and that the greatest sin was disobedience not wrongs.

I view it is a fantasy flick, full of sorcary and demons set in Japan. A fantasy depiction of a real event. Nothing wrong with that. I just think that the all japanese cast except for Mr. Reeves didnt flow well with the american audience and the fact that as the main character keanu Reeves didnt rub too well with japanese audiences. However these racial issues were addressed in the film an justified. Keanu Reeves character was a half breed and it was well established and in context to the story of the film. And i can appreciate the all Japanese cast, if the film is set in japan, it should be that way. It was also a very pretty film to watch, especially on a large or 3D TV. The depiction of japan and characters wardrobe were absolutly awsome. The story telling was good and so was the pacing. So i dont get all the bad criticism the film has gotten."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Ultimately I enjoyed this movie as just a movie but what really sets it back is having the fantasy elements thrown in.  This true legend of the 47 Ronin doesn't need fireballs and a mystical hair demon lady, it made the experience more cartoonish than serious.  Another dropping point is Keanu Reaves, a random white guy samurai who's acting capability compares to the plank of wood people call Kristen Stewart.  Luckily for this film Hiroyuki Sanada makes up for everything, he is a fantastic actor.  I really enjoyed that they used mostly Japanese actors but again, they're speaking in english.  I do not mean to insult or sound like a jerk but their accents added to the hilariousness of the film.  When the shogunate speaks it's just funny.  This is very unfortunate because Japanese is such a bad ass sounding language filled with great emotion.  Had they allowed the actors to speak Japanese it would have elevated the experience.  But for whatever reason Keanu Reaves had to be there.\rAnother issue I have, that isn't the biggest deal, but it was PG13.  Which means people get cut by a katana and there's no blood.  That doesn't swing with me, the sharpest blade in history will make you bleed.  Much like my issue with Krueger in Elysium, the giant towering fear-invoking demon samurai never really did anything in this movie and his death was an absolute cop out.\rThis movie had so much potential to tell and recreate a true epic story.

After a cursory glance at reviews I thought it would be a mindless throw-away experience.  However, I could not have been more wrong.\r This movie surpassed all of my expectations.

It's an ending that Western audiences may not understand as being \"happy\" without having some knowledge of the Bushido code.\r In terms of pacing, I felt that the movie moved along at a brisk pace - never at any moment did I feel a scene overstayed it's welcome.  In comparison, when I watched Hobbit: Desolation recently, I fell asleep probably 2-3 times due to many of the over-drawn scenes.\r Overall, I thought it was a great, entertaining movie.

While such premise could draw people attention, but there also lies its weakness, it's severely predictable. Many have used simple already known concept and made it into fresh interesting watch, unfortunately for this movie spamming CG is not amongst the way to accomplish that. Hindered by poor acting, questionable cast and uneven storytelling, 47 Ronin feels detached and uninspiring despite its gorgeous visual.\r From graphical standpoint, it's actually quite impressive. Mythical creatures roam its vibrant realm, colors are brightly sleek and the dark contrast makes for a good view. It's certainly up to par on other fantasy movies, although it does detract from more historical portrayal of feudal Japan. There's a bit exaggeration in it as well, almost as if it's a westernized version of Japan. Some scenes, especially with the quick battles or bizarre giant characters, have the grayish murky tone of medieval fantasy like The Hobbits, and while the style direction is a bit excessive, seeing kimono in brimming flamboyant dye is rather peculiar, it's acceptably eye pleasing.\r Problems emerge when it tries to implement the story, which could be inspirational but remarkably falls flat. Keanu Reeves plays Kai, a half breed from an Englishman and a Japanese woman, the film's original character meant to portray an elevating underdog story, yet Reeves displays only one set of facial expression. He looks almost completely the same throughout the movie, there's barely any allure on seeing such monotonous hero. At the very least, his stiff performance can be considered as consistency, ironically so.\r The use of English is awkward as well, The Last Samurai did the multilingual tone and it worked, so it could have used Japanese for more authenticity. There's a nagging feeling that something is amiss, specifically when the movie enters supposedly dramatic moments. Setting that aside, the script isn't exactly great either, most of the time it goes overly melodramatic, as if it wants the archaic feel of Japanese classic but delivered in mediocre English.\r Casting is dubious, everyone has the samurai look and with boorish script, everyone is equally trapped in their respective dull role; there's your serious samurai and next to him are the sad samurai and funny samurai. Granted, there's not enough time to highlight them all, but none of them stand out or have the chance to perform to the fullest. Rinko Kikuchi, who earned Oscar and Golden Globe nomination for Babel, plays the evil witch, although her presence merely resembles a bitter high school cheerleader. The characters are just terribly shallow, when the leading male barely does robotic mumbles and the Oscar nominee looks that uncomfortable, it does nothing to draw the audience's interest.\r During the two hours of its length, the flow feels fragmented, mainly because it consists of drab scenes with little beautiful vista sprinkled in between. There is no epic scale engaging skirmish to behold, just some small CG fights, which is odd since the appeal should be a smaller group of warriors against mightier force. It does boast a spectacle, but no amount of cosmetic can justify the bland use of Japanese classic."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I just saw the movie, and I must say it\u00b4s really  a Masterpiece.

Anyone who saw this film and thought Keanu Reeves was the star was mistaken. Keanu is a viewpoint character for (western) viewers. Hiroyuki Sanada is the star of this story of betrayal, revenge and misplaced but well-intentioned bushido. The fantastic aspects are simply flash on the side that embellish a long embellished story and expose uninitiated audiences to the alien mythos of Japan. They aren't necessary, but they add elements those in the know will appreciate.\r That's not to say the film is perfect. Other than a brief but solid set piece involving the aforementioned mystical elements (and a great and novel interpretation of a classic Japanese race of creatures), the second act is sloppy with far too rapid scene cuts, dissolving from one to the next without a fair share between the lot as if to remind the viewers that certain characters are indeed still in the film. After that, the third act rolls on without a hitch to an excellent climax and a bittersweet finish that might leave oblivious westerners with a sour taste.\r This reviewer noticed that apparently many reviewers were \"forced\" to buy a ticket themselves to see the film (oh the horror!) and wonders if it's too beyond the pale that their reviews were especially rotten for this reason. In any case, it's worth noting that while a certain aggregate site has critic reviews at around 10%, the audience review is closer to 65% (which is approximately the same here). If 47 Ronin looks interesting to you, you'll probably like it. Ignore critic reviews since they seem to have a natural aversion to scifi and fantasy, really anything that requires suspension of disbelief (beyond Keanu Reeves' ability to emote). Check it out at a matinee showing with some friends and judge it for yourself.\r (The only real gripes I have are that the swordplay is more European--sword clashes are almost never okay with katana unless you want a chipped or shattered sword--and the Dutch pirate with the skeleton tattoo makes a cameo appearance at most.)\r Also, complaints about inaccuracies or additions to the film ring hollow for me. The Chushingura has been told countless times in bunraku and kabuki plays, other films by Japanese directors, and even in opera and on and on. This is a new and original take on the story and should not be discounted due to tertiary liberties."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "though it has some dull action sequences in between..but the first 40 minutes and the ending truly kept me gripped onto the movie..And its definitely one of the most underrated films of 2013..its not that bad.."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "All the action the movie has can be seen in the trailer. The acting is not what made the movie bad, i can't even put my finger on what made it bad exactly, all i can say is that it's a very boring movie, you keep waiting to the action to start only to see the movie is about to end and no decent action scene was seen."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "47 Ronin is a well-done presentation of one the most famous legends of Japan. Keanu does a splendid performance, but the other leading men are great.. Sadly, the critics' Eurocentric attitudes have blinders on and just don't get it. I applaud all the care and hard work put into this wonderful movie."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Takes the historical true story and infuses it with elements of mystical beasts, magic, and witches. This and the ham-fisted and occasionally goofy dialog do make it hard to take the movie too seriously. I did enjoy the action scenes a lot and wish there were more of them. It's the moments between the action that lower my score for the movie. There's nothing particularly wrong with the slower scenes, it's just that nothing really entertaining happens in them. Still, these scenes are at least watchable.\r I didn't really find anything terrible about the film at all. Yes I would have preferred more of the cool action scenes, but the moments in between didn't bore me even if they didn't necessarily entertain. It's a highly watchable film, but I recommend only a rental and only when other options have been exhausted. If you liked the trailers you should find something to like here, I just recommend you don't expect anything particularly great. My total score is a 6.1/10=Okay."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I see why many critics weren't happy with 47 Ronin.  The plot was predictable and well-worn in places as was some of the dialogue.  But it was a fun action picture with lovely cinematography.  Keanu Reeves does facial expression nuances well.  I went into it knowing it wasn't going to be winning any awards for thoughtfulness and depth, and I came out satisfied, having enjoyed this movie for exactly what it was."}], "recommendations": ["beowulf", "jupiter_ascending", "samson", "valerian_and_the_city_of_a_thousand_planets", "sucker_punch", "the_13th_warrior", "dredd", "ben_hur", "king_arthur_legend_of_the_sword", "9", "the_three_musketeers", "alita_battle_angel", "oblivion", "avengers_age_of_ultron", "v_for_vendetta", "the_green_knight", "hercules", "inception", "the_darkest_minds", "hugo", "300", "tomorrowland", "serenity", "mortal_engines", "the_american"]}
