      "text": "I really like Omar Epps, I've been a fan of his ever since House but this film was embarrassingly bad even for Netflix standards. The cast itself, especially Epps and Long give their best efforts but the story and screenplay is just so by the numbers and it does nothing to even try to be scary or at the very least thrilling"

    {
      "rating": "5",
      "text": "I watched this because it had a couple of old school actors that I liked (Omar Epps and Nia Long). However, the acting was not that great. And the plot was slightly predictable. It was a good one to watch in the background while working out or doing something else on your to-do list. Entertaining in a junk food consumption type of way."
