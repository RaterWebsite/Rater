Well you have if you've seen the 1941 animated version, but these days Disney insists on remaking all their old classics because\u00a0they're all out of ideas, they want to bring in a new generation of fans. In 2019 you can see Dumbo fly all over again in a live adaptation remake. A truly magical moment on the big screen again only with better effects, so does it hold up to the original animation? No, it doesn't. Sorry Tim Burton I'm a huge fan and all but this is nowhere near the standard it should be.Dumbo isn't exactly a film that needs an introduction but you're getting one anyway. It's a baby elephant with oversized ears that allow him to fly, which turns out to be a blessing for a struggling circus but also attracts the attention of the shady entrepreneur V.A. Vandevere (Michael Keaton). This remake or reimagining as they like to call it, for the most part is pretty much the same story with the addition of some new characters, Colin Farrell, Danny DeVito, Eva Green and Michael Keaton. Honestly if it wasn't for Farrell and DeVito this would be so much worse, their characters are interesting and time has been spent developing their characters. I can't exactly say the same for everyone else. Eva Green is just there to look pretty and the rest of the cast if I'm honest don't add much. It all feels very generic. Michael Keaton just went full on with this role, yes Michael we all know you play a great villain but perhaps you should have toned it down a notch, I understand as a children's film certain things are embellished slightly but there's a line and Keaton goes well beyond it. I've mentioned this before, if you're going to remake a film you should at least try to make some changes and add your own spin on it. Well this may have Tim Burton's name on it but it doesn't really feel like a Burton film. It has the signature Danny Elfman score sure but that's about it. Dumbo 2019 doesn't tug at the heart strings like the original 1941 version. If like me you haven't seen the original since you were a child then maybe give it another watch because there's a lot of dark themes within the story. Whereas this remake has little to no impact which makes you think what was the point. No seriously Disney I'm actually asking you, what is the point? Remake everything almost shot for shot, or else make another sequel to one of your many franchises, is that all we're getting now? At this rate the trend of Disney making a live adaptation of their old movies is going to get tiresome real quick.\u00a0The Jungle Book\u00a0and\u00a0Beauty and the Beast have done well but with\u00a0Aladdin, The Lion King\u00a0and\u00a0Mulan on the horizon it doesn't look like we're getting anything original for a while.

I can not say either that it's a good movie, is not up to the old one. It has the essence of the original but a lot of things are changed (I already said it, the Burton label).

But what we ended up getting in Tim Burton's \"Dumbo\" is a movie that tries too hard to be different than the original animated effort. Whether it's Michael Keaton's evil carnival tycoon character, the financial integrity of his suspiciously anachronistic amusement park, or any of the other non-animal beings associated with the title character's plight, there's simply too much going on in here that either diverts too far from the source material, fails to entertain, or does both of these things. In fact, the only elements of this movie that do work are the few that are actually retained from the original. Dumbo is cute, you ache at the fact that he's lost his mother, and it is a joy to see him fly. What exactly are you trying to be, movie? A faithful retelling of a beloved children's tale or a more post-modern examination of the same events? Trying to be both of these at once is unwise, yes? Yet this is the film we're given; a moderately enjoyable yet frequently baffling mishmash of ideas that amounts to what I can easily say is the weakest of Disney's live action remake catalogue."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "This was nothing like the classic I remember from my childhood.

Or he was just deliberately made a stupid character to prop up the character of Milly. De Vito was excellent. Farrel was meh. Rest of the characters were forgetful as well.

However, I will say that from what little I do remember from the animated version, they did do a rather fine job of building upon the story and also adding to it and making it interesting and worthwhile with human characters, as there weren't really any in the animated version. It's got a stellar cast, including Colin Farrell, Michael Keaton, Eva Green, Danny DeVito, etc. all of whom give great performances. Furthermore, the visuals are a spectacle to behold, much like the circus and shows within the film. As for some minor cons, I wasn't sure what to think of the slightly darker tone in comparison to the animated version (though I should've known better since it's Tim Burton directing), but the more I think about it, the more I believe that his trademark style added a unique and worthwhile touch to the film for the most part, even if it did feel quite a bit like a sequel to 'Big Fish' often times (the fact that DeVito is in both films and Burton directed both only added to this feeling for me.) Overall, it's obviously nothing too fresh or new, and while I found it to be maybe not as solid as some of Disney's other live-action adaptations, it's still pretty dazzling and fun for the most part, making it just worthwhile enough."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "The 2019 live action remake of Dumbo helmed by Tim Burton falls short on almost every aspect. The plot of the original Dumbo takes up the entirety of the first act of the movie. The second and third acts of the film become a weird, meta commentary about Disney as a corporation, with a scenery-chewing Michael Keaton holding the audience's hand as he guides them through a diesel-punk capitalist nightmare. There's a lot of strange attempts by the movie to be \"woke\" about animal cruelty, but being \"woke\" about race or class is strikingly absent. Maybe this is intentional, as the original Dumbo is racially insensitive at best. While the movie isn't bad per se, it is disappointing, and left me with a feeling of \"so what?\" as the credits rolled."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "First of all, baby Dumbo is the cutest thing ever and whenever he was on screen I only paid attention to him. The special effects team had to make a cute baby elephant with big ears and they did just that. Now the acting in this film could\u2019ve been better by certain people and others did their parts really well. One of those people was Colin Farrell, who played Holt Farrier. He stood out to me mainly because I really enjoyed his character and what he was going through and out of all of them I think he\u2019s definitely the most relatable one. For the rest of the cast though I could tell they were trying but probably should\u2019ve been recasted for example, Michael Keaton as V. A. Vandevere. I\u2019ve seen Michael Keaton be a great actor in other works but this just didn\u2019t suit him. The character seemed like it was created for Johnny Depp but Tim Burton couldn\u2019t get him so he had to go with the second option. Also, I hate hating on kid actors because they\u2019re kids but the daughter in this film was just bland. But then again this is her first movie ever so I\u2019ll give her a break. I do love the set designs in this film though. I also love the message in this film and I think there\u2019s actually two now that I think about it. Two things I would change if I could would be the pacing in the film and the ending. The pacing in this film felt slow until the end where it picked up way too quickly that it felt rushed. Which leads into how the ending was awkward and I didn\u2019t feel like it was a good conclusion. In the end, Dumbo is a good kids film or for people who like Disney movies.

Also it's hard to resist the charm of Danny DeVito and Michael Keaton in their roles. However, the film falters in most other regards, with a story that puts more emphasis on the lifeless, boring human characters instead of Dumbo, changing a lot of the main significance/themes from the original movie. Even with a longer running time, it still feels like the story is rushing out of its originally okay beginning to a lackluster second half.

Probably, this has always been the risk that Tim Burton's (the director) sketchy cartoonish world comes with. Even looking at his previous projects, you can easily say that each of the visual galores could have gone wrong. But it is that fine analysation of emotion that Burton personifies on a screen with one dimensional characters; that makes it, against all odds, much better. So when you hear about the collaboration of Burton and Disney, you would think that it is a match made in heaven. Unfortunately, you are going to lose that bet, for carrying out such a wallop of drama, he has decided to surf above it, in fact hover around it, but will not and does not get his hand dirty.There is no string attached to the storytelling, no thread to link them all, ironically in a concept where everyone is rooting for one innocent character. You feel physically distant with this world, not when it tries to brag about its cookiness but when expresses the humane qualities. Although, for a brief period, it does get your feet taping in rhythm, but the credit goes to the \"teamwork\" theme that Disney has been endorsing since ages.The performance is decent coming from Danny DeVito as a goofy manager and Nico Parker as a sweet host of the storyline. And on the other hand, major contenders like Colin Farrell as an over brooding post war hero, Eva Green as the dame and Michael Keaton as a stereotypical evil billionaire fails to make our heart pump fast.

Disney's new Dumbo recreation is not only a technological marvel, it's a precious tale with heart and deep elements. The message of the original film still has failed to been heard and many horrible acts of torture exist on earth. This is why I was not mad about the plot pretty much being the same as it's animated counterpart. Anyways let's judge the actual movie for what it is. The film began pretty poorly to me, it's lousy editing and slow start discouraged me but that first flight gave me chills. The way they treated Dumbo's mom made my blood boil which means they really put shrill and real life elements into this flik. Danny Devito (Max Medici) and Nico Parker (Milly Farrier) were huge standouts to me. The heart and devotion they put into their characters was undeniable. Most of the other actors did amazing as well. It was hard to imagine them pulling off the dialogue as the original doesn't have much of it, but they do. But the third act is where the movie really peaked. I couldn't take my eyes away. It was so magnificent but horrifying at the same time. Overall this movie was good, the first 2 lousy acts were made up for with a magnificent finale."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Although I put it on the list of my top 10 most anticipated movies of the year, I can't deny that I was very skeptical about this. From the moment I knew that the original 1941 animated classic would made into a live-action film, I was really worried how it would turn out. I mean, the beloved animated classic has a very simple story that could only work (at least as I thought) in an animation form. The original Dumbo alongside My Neighbor Totoro are the most \"innocent\" films I've seen in my life. Add to this the fact that it's directed by Tim Burton (one of my favourite filmmakers) whose adaptation of Alice in Wonderland wasn't the best thing it could be (although I liked it).To my surprise (and a lot of people's, I reckon), Burton's rendering of Dumbo marks Burton's return to his creative, unique vision he's always been known for. I can see Burton here at his brilliant. The eccentric visual panache that distinguish Burton's works are evidently present here and not only for its own sake. Burton's imaginative visuals that leap off the screen, as Dumbo's cuteness do, also add to the storytelling a great deal.What surprised me even more is when I found that this live-action remake isn't a \"remake\" per se. This is more like a movie that's inspired by the story of the original. Needless to say, the human characters here are way more richer and well-rounded than they were in the the animated film. Simply because: 1) most of them are new. 2) some of them are technically the protagonists of the story. And I can say that these characters are given a considerable amount of depth.The villain, played by Michael Keaton, is a bit over-the-top, but I think Keaton put his touch on it, and made me forget about that for the most part. Eva Green is just fine as always. Colin Farrell is just great as always. Danny DeVito is just likable as always. All the actors did a fine job, except for Nico Parker whose acting rubbed me the wrong way as well as her infuriatingly stereotypical character.Halfway through I thought the movie is pretty good, if certainly not as poignant and warm as the animated classic. At the third act, which is a bit overlong, the story became quite basic. It ends up treading very familiar territory. Even some characters have changed to fit the approach the movie took at the end, such as the villain who became even more over-the-top. For all that I couldn't help being less invested in the story, and the stretched denouement didn't help either. I also found how the things tuned out at the end a tad unsatisfying. And I believe that the moral at the end was slightly on-the-nose. That said, the messages that the movie conveys are well-woven into the fabric of the story. Mostly due to Burton's masterful visual storytelling techniques, including ingenious foreshadowing.The CGI isn't as good as I expected. I wasn't looking for something like what I saw in Favreau's The Jungle Book, but I hoped the rest of the animals would look as good as the elephants do, Dumbo in particular. Because if there is only one thing Burton did better than Favreau, it would be making the lovely baby elephant Dumbo as realistic as it's agonizingly cute. But unfortunately the CGI in general looks a bit outdated in comparison to what Hollywood has achieved in the recent years.All in all, I loved this version of Dumbo so much. And I think it's one of the best live-action remakes Disney has made so far. Also, now I can be pretty optimistic about Tim Burton's upcoming projects after I was quite disappointed from Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children.(7.5/10)"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This film has done its job.

The story, very faithful to the Disney original, with the exception of one scene. The characters, yes a lot of them are human, but it's live action (touche to Disney). To an emotional scale, I am not one to actually break out in tears in the theater, being I'm very thick-skinned when watching a movie, but 'Dumbo' takes the very first time I broke out crying when \"Baby Mine\" is played. The scene itself, from the emotion, piling on itself numerous times in a matter of thirty seconds, just completes the movie, even though it's not even halfway through.

Yes, Disney may want to captivate a new public using the tools they used years ago, but it is not entirely fair not to innovate in the frames and only get to limit themselves to the superficial of their previous proposals.Dumbo is simply wonderful in every technical sense. Tim Burton is undoubtedly a master of inventiveness and imagination since the world created in this movie is simply spectacular. We know a director who is not always conventional and he surprises us with his films in terms of the plot and the effects, but here in Dumbo, I find it fascinating as he is a retailer and how honest his proposal is.

Yeah, no comment.Now, for some lessons on Mouse House screenwriting 101:Pander early on by throwing in a lazy shot of field-working slaves for no reason.Neglect the details, don\u2019t make it clear right away that it\u2019s the ears that make the pipsqueak a freak.Don\u2019t show anyone affected by the danger of a baby animal.Make sure when there\u2019s a sad scene between animals, don\u2019t show them crying, a lady playing on a ukulele will suffice.Reference an old Hollywood masterpiece, Raging Bull, by making Dumbo\u2019s big top intro mimic a boxing match, with focus on the mike\u2026 to please genuine movie fans!Talk down to the PG-rated crowd.\u200bWith all these blaring issues, it goes to no surprise that nobody in the screenplay changes by the end, particularly the daughter, who hopes to pursue science outside the three rings. A key necklace is supposed to be a core component to her arc, yet it\u2019s addressed exactly twice\u2014nowhere near enough times! She almost positively hates being in the project, much like Colin Farrell, as he makes clear through his performance.There are those appropriately dark moments, ones with indistinguishable animal silhouettes in black fog, but they are so short and so sparse, it doesn\u2019t redeem how little the adults behind this feature expect out  of young developing minds. It thinks children are inept at comprehending tragedy, just a lemur singing, \u201cI like to move it, move it!\u201d Yet in truth, as much as you try to sustain a crap circus for gullible minds to watch, the financial complications take over. These losers cannot bring the near-bankrupt circus back on top\u2014they cannot manage money responsibly!Yet Disney still builds up the hype, as after their past hits across animation and Broadway won over the public, they now continually tarnish their reputation with awful photorealistic remakes. People have said good things about them so far, but it seems over time that lower faith will be found toward such a nostalgic studio as it becomes a victim of its own identity. Of everyone responsible for this train wreck, only Oscar legend Colleen Atwood meets her high standard as she allows the visual power of costumes to flourish.Surely you know yourself well enough to know that a movie where Morgan \u201cGod\u201d Freeman gives Steve Carell ark-construction supplies is really only an excuse to make poop jokes. Surely you trust yourself enough to stop gullibly giving your money to an evil corporation despite all the signs from trailers and marketing saying to you, \u201cwe don\u2019t care!\u201d Do civilization a favor; ignore the pachyderm conga line at the Disney Corp. & Burton & Keaton Circus."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "I'm sorry, but this movie is pure garbage.

Burton\u2019s world-building is transportive, with the aid of Ben Davis\u2019 stunning, silhouette-adept cinematography which sends the heart soaring when Dumbo takes flight. There\u2019s an enchanting bubble sequence that, albeit momentarily defies the grounded feel prior, feels like an ode to the wonder of Fantasia (the music from Danny Elfman, a frequent collaborator, is toe-tappingly excellent but lacks in walkaway power). But the same magic isn\u2019t there. Dumbo is, in fact, an aerodynamic impossibility, there\u2019s a scene where we\u2019re supposed to believe Green\u2019s character can\u2019t see an airborne elephant around her, and Dreamland is a telling indicator that Disney have never heard the phrase, \u201ccheck yourself before you wreck yourself\u201d.
