      "text": "A mediocre action movie made in 2018. Another one of Bruce Willis' last term fiasco. I'm really sad watching it. Two of my favorite actors, Bruce Willis and Frank Grillo, are ruining their careers in both movies they played together. It's hard to understand why this duo has dropped to TV movie quality.A bank is robbed. Bank manager Grillo. His neighbor is retired cop Willis. He is trying to find the man in these. That's the point. It's just comedy that American cops always stay on target and fall like a pear. No one can catch the man in the heart of the city.There is no sex in the movie."
