It's a pale shadow of a Pixar film, but the kids in the theater all seemed to enjoy it.

The movie also does a great job of capturing the personalities of Red, Chuck, Terence and Bomb. That being said, the writing is clunky  and the plot is just slightly more complex than the original game story. Most of the gags involve potty humor, but I'll admit to laughing a few times.

Now, it is no 'Inside Out' movie - but still a funny movie with an decent flow.  Yes, the script is predictable - in Angry Birds the pigs are always after the eggs, right?  So you know where the movie is headed - but that alright.  That is the same with many movies.  What is more important is the movie has good humor along the way and develops the characters well  ...  well, about as well as you can develop a cartoon character.  My kids loved it and there was a lot of laughter throughout the theater from all the other kids as the movie played out.  So the kids in attendance enjoyed the movie and that makes it a success.

Because 'Angry Birds' game is one of the mainstream games which is originally from Finland. Despite the mixed reviews, it is a box office success and definitely a sequel on the card. After lots of animal themed films, now in the line of underrated animation 'Free Birds', another the bird's quest begins with this.\r I'm not much into this game, but I was looking forward to the film since it was first announced. Now I'm here after the watch and I think is a good film, but better suitable for children than the adults. That did not stop me from enjoying it. The target audience might be the kids with those cute film characters, as well as the story, but there are some dialogues that are written keeping in mind the grownups. Anyway, most of the adults won't feel they are in a wrong cinema hall if they regularly watch animation films, especially in the present world animations are accepted as for all ages.\r So this is the story about the Red, an orphan bird lives in a small house on the sea shore. The kids from the island loves him, but the adults stay away from him for his bad anger attitude. One day a ship of pigs arrives on the bird's island offering friendship, but their intention was later known once the valuables things were stolen from them. So the revenge and rescue operation begins which stretched with full of action-adventure in the remaining parts.\r Filled with lots of fun moments, it was much better than I expected. Sometimes it looked cute, but you know our angry bird, Red with his companions makes it not to stay that way. Peter Dinklage as Might Eagle was one of the highlights of the film and the rest of the cast did well too. It is definitely a great directional debute for the two experienced animators. Makes a bit sad how the film was received, but after seeing it myself I think its fine. Different people have different opinion. In my perspective, it was a good watch so I surely suggest it, especially for animation fans and obviously children.\r 7/10"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "The movie is really entertaining , fun all the time, i was totally enjoy watching the show , it deliver more than expected , it deserved a score of 10 out of 10 !"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "One of the best videogame movie adaptation!The main problem is PG rating which is clearly should be PG-13)))"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I remember when i played Angry Birds on my ipod, it was a fun game.

It stayed true to the source material like the personalities of the birds and the birds going on the slingshot to defeat the pigs. I liked the idea of giving the birds and pigs feet and arms instead of having birds and pigs without those body parts, that was a smart idea. The plot is kinda predictable, the humor is a hit and miss and what the **** is with pigs slapping their asses? Isn't this a kids movie you guys?

So huge was its success that seven years later, a film adaptation has been established in the theatres around the world, while retaining the same color palette of the game, its main characters and even a song from the original. However, its characters aren't the only ones angry, spectators are really angry to see the silly and unbalanced screenplay of the story. In certain way, the extravagant colors, cheap jokes, and even references manage to hide that lack, even so, lack is evident. Nevertheless, \"Angry Birds Movie\" is the greater favorite video game adaptation in the summer season, with the support of adolescents, adults and most children. At least at the box office amass more fortune than its competitors due to the level of recognition, although \"Warcraft\" and \"Assassin's Creed\" may give the fight.\r Fortunately, Sony film is not worthy of the ratings and opinions negative by the audience, well, at least not of all. The expectations for this film were too low, due to the complicated and arduous work to create a story with so few elements, adding to this, the little experience evidenced in previous adaptations of electronic games. Sony gets to engage in a true animated movie, failing in its terrible script, creating lack of chemistry and consistency, not very present in neighbouring companies (Diney - Pixar and even Dreamworks). Bird design is beautiful, majestic and excellently projected, its colors, textures, personalities and sizes make this adventure, a real game of \"Angry Birds\".\r We meddle in its main scarcity, \"The Lego Movie\" is a clear reference of a flawless screenplay. Perhaps, screenplay by Jon Vitti (Alvin and the Chipmunks) is simple and limited by the almost nil tools on which they are based, hampering the creation of characters more deep. They thought that by being a film directed mainly to the public children, the plot should be simple and clear, without much depth or complexity in order to solve the basic questions of the game.\r Why are angry the \"Angry Birds\"?\r In an anthropomorphic world, all kinds of birds coexist in a peaceful, fun, colorful and friendly place (an island), all but Red (voiced by Jason Sudeikis) a embittered and resentful bird with life since child due to his physical appearance, his temperament was not the best and he is forced to attend classes to control his anger with the beautiful and delicate Matilda (voiced by Maya Rudolph). There, he finds to his three companions of adventures, Chuck (voiced by Josh Gad) an animated yellow canary with  speed powers (with a clear scene referenced to 'Quicksilver' (\"X-MEN\")),  Bomb (voiced by Danny McBride) a black, bomb-shaped bird, which cannot control his temper and simply explodes and finally and less present Terrence (voiced by Senn Pean) a biggish red bird with noble feelings. The group of misfits will have to save their city from the dangerous and malicious green pigs, an unprecedented adventure began.\r \"Angry Birds\" pleases to infants with a predictable, colorful and entertaining story, but also meets with ironic humor to the public adult with perfect and clear references to \"The Shining\", \"X-MEN\" and classic Tex Avery gags. If the screenplay had not been so redundant in the themes and repetitive objectives in animated films (the family, the hero, save your city, happy ending), would be the perfect blend with high quality graphic effects. We consider, this film like a game of \"Angry Birds\", where all pigs have been defeated, but the final score doesn't reaches three stars of score."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This is the best video game i have ever seen.

It's just like Hotel Transylvania to me; the story's great, the characters are memorable, the jokes are funny, the puns are decent and the high speed, energy and quick pace matches the comedic delivery perfectly. Sure it doesn't reach the lengths of Pixar, but what do you expect from Sony. It's just a good movie.

Where are the female pigs?!\rFor me, this movie is worth it! 100%"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "The movie was enjoyable, for a Angry Birds fan like me The only problem with the movie is that the movie was labeled to be about a island full of happy birds, but Red has a really bad temper, which he is labeled as an outcast. His stories are shown, like his early days, it shows that Red hatched without his parents by his side, he is alone, with no parents. Then during his school days, he gets bullied for his big ass eyebrows, and the fact that he was born without parents, labeling him as a failure to his parents. The main problem is that you need to give more detail to the story, here is an example. Show how the parents abandoned Red, or show more of his bullying, like maybe him getting harassed so much that he losses it and beats one of them up, since the rating is PG, this can be acceptable. Same goes for Chuck and Bomb, show their stories. They are labeled as outcast also, so show how they were born, were they abandoned, mistreated, abused, or given a special power. Show their school life/early childhood, were they bullied, picked on, or did they get in a lot of trouble, we don't know, there is a lot missing here! Make the birds relate to the kids, so they can relate them self to the birds, maybe they are going though that situation or something, we don't know, but it would add spice to the plot. Just add more flashbacks, since it adds a lot more to the plot, like add Mighty Eagles story for god sakes! Tell us how he became mighty eagle, or what he is notable for. Another problem i have with the movie is the fact that the adult jokes go WAY to far if you think about it. Like when red says \"Drop your nuts and move your butts!\" If you think about it, it is literally a masturbation joke, and some kids might even realize that, i don't know, there are a lot of screwed up kids these days. One more problem I have with the movie is that none of the fan fiction lovers are in here. Like Chuck and Stella, or Bomb and Matilda. The fact that Matilda and Terrence sorta loved each other at the end pissed me off! This could have added alot more action to the film. Maybe Chuck saves Stella from danger and risk himself, or a love story between Bomb and Matilda, it would have made the film more action packed, which I KNOW it is rated PG, but still, kids deserve better.

It's a funny and charming movie that's for the entire family! Forget about what the critics say. This movie really is this years LEGO Movie."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "'The Angry Birds Movie' is, in short, harmless. We all know as adults, we tend to dread these kinds of animated films because they seem so obnoxious, and rather pointless. I say pointless simply because the game, which you can download on your iPhone, which was released in 2009, peaked in popularity through the early 2010s. Had this movie been released at least 3 or 4 years ago, it would seem more relevant.\r \"Angry Birds\" focuses on a bird named Red (voiced by Jason Sudeikis), who has pretty much been ridiculed his entire life due to his short temper and thick eye brows. When an incident occurs at a little child's birthday party, Red has been told he needs to attend an anger management session. This is where he meets the fast-paced Chuck (Josh Gad), and Bomb (Danny McBride) who share their stories of how they can;t control either their speed, or how Bomb can't control not being able to explode.\r The plot kick-starts as soon as we meet Leonard (Bill Hader), a leader pig who comes to the birds' hometown, and starts holding parties and begins to win the community's respect. However, Red isn't so sure about this, and himself, Chuck and Bomb discover that they are hiding something in the ship that they travelled in.\r The rest of the birds' think that they are lying, and Red tries his best to convince them that the group of menacing pigs are trying to steal the birds' eggs.\r Red, Chuck and Bomb travel far to meet the Mighty Eagle (Peter Dinklage) and ask for his help. This scene, strangely enough and without spoiling it, leads to nowhere. The plot speeds up as soon as Red, Chuck and Bomb convince the bird population to go to war with the pigs, and develop a massive slingshot to hit their castle. Anybody who has played an \"Angry Birds\" game on their iPhone will know that's the aim of the game, assemble your bird onto a slingshot and sling them against the pigs and their obstacles. It's admittedly addictive, but to put this into a film, it can be hard to make it interesting and convincing.\r The main problem with this film is that it seems to have trouble balancing the jokes and the plot. There are times where the plot will move for about 10 minutes, and then the film grinds to a sudden halt to make a joke that has nothing to do with the premise of the film for about 5 minutes, then the film wakes up and the plot continues. The fact that it keeps stopping to make jokes in order to get laughs seems forced. Plus, the nature of the jokes are predictable. Let's just say that there is a scene in which a main character lands in a small room full of dynamite and he gets up and says \"Well, that's dynamite\". Or take another scene, where we see the main characters bathing and drinking in some holy lake, only to discover that every morning a certain character urinates in that lake every morning, the urinating joke goes on for about 3 or 4 minutes. If you wanted those jokes to be a surprise, then I'm sorry I spoiled it for you.\r The only character that made me laugh the most would be Bomb, voiced by Danny McBride, but even then, his joking time seems to be limited. The rest of the talented cast do seem wasted in their roles, Sudeikis, who is very funny, doesn't have much inventive material to work with. The same can be said for Josh Gad and BIll Hader, two actors who can be funny with the right material, but they are weighed down by cliched, animated kids movie, predictable jokes.\r Like I said before...this film is harmless...children will definitely have fun with its fast-paced and colorful tone, and adults will tolerate this enough, but you will forget this film existed. It's funny at times, but the predictable jokes are noticeable, plus the fact that the plot has to stop in order to make these jokes can be a distraction."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "why so much hate for this movie?? see.. this movie is for kids.. big donkeys like the critics go and watch this film and give a bad rating.. i took my little sister to this movie and she enjoyed a lot.. probably that kid had the best day in her life.. so i definitely want to give this movie a perfect ten!! and talking about the movie, the graphics are flawless and awesome.. the movie is a decent watch for me too.. it never gets boring.. despite very little run time, it entertains the most.. and i have to mention about the final half an hour of the movie.. the action scenes were just great and highly entertaining.. thumbs up!! haters go get a life..!!"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Rovio's mobile game series manages makes the turn to movie form better than the average video game flick. The direction of family-oriented animated movie was a great move. Granted, that was really the only area they could go, but still.\r The sense of humor is on point for the majority of it's running time. Given the lack of really any sort of narrative in the games, we do get stuck with a chintzy plot and some awkward characters, particularly in the villain department. These pigs are kind of a bland threat. However the movie more than makes up for it due to it's fun, imaginative, and energetic nature.\r The jokes come a mile a minute. Just about any type of humor you can think of is here. Even some surprisingly mature jokes here and there for the parents. Every now and then some of the more questionable gags will drag on for a bit too long and there's a weird fascination the directors seem to have with their character's butts, but for the most part all of the humor nails the landing.\r As far as the presentation goes it couldn't be much better. The animation is so stunning that it rivals the best of Pixar and the entire voice cast is almost perfect. The flaw comes from Bill Hader who hams it up (I'm so funny) too much as the main villain. The soundtrack is both surprising in it's choice of songs as it is fantastic.\r It's a great movie for the kid fans of the game as well as their parents.
