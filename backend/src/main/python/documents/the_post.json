With HANKS & STREEP in mega large font at the very top, and the actual title of the film in very small font at the bottom.  \"Look, two names we know an love!... oh, and it's called The Post\".  Pathetic tactic.  Totally unoriginal, banal and just plain boring.  The shame lies in the fact that the true story is an amazing one.  You've seen this film a million times over.  It was called 'All the Presidents Men' the first time.  Cookie cutter political big name bait at it's finest.  I advise leaving this movie for the birds and watching 'All the Presidents Men', followed by a Pentagon Papers documentary of your choice.  There are many great ones. In ten years this film will be hardly remembered, regardless of hollow accolades."

The cast is excellent and Spielberg does a good job of evoking the look and feel of the era.  Many will roll their eyes and sneer at the self-congratulatory nature of the proceedings, but it's still a story that's worth telling nearly 50 years later."

      "text": "It's always been a delight to watch a Steven Spielberg movie; no matter which style or genre he's tackling, he's a proven master craftsman who has a unique way of handling lives. This time, he has chosen to say the story of a big triumph in a small world of 'free expression'; the courage it took for Katharine Graham, the owner-publisher of the Washington Post, to divulge highly classified information on one of the biggest diplomatic lies that has ever been told-the Pentagon papers and the Vietnam War! It was no mere journalistic victory, given a bold Lady's guts it took to make an advance move; the effort put in by Ben Bradlee-the Editor in Chief, and his team in condensing the immense contents of the papers to its simplest relatable form. There's a scene in the movie where Katherine quotes her husband Phil, on the ironic immensity of the press' nature-\"News is the first rough draft of History!\". And who brings it out, definitely the Press. If there's been a big reason as to why Spielberg made 'The Post' in 2017, it's to assert the significance of free Press and censure in a Democratic setup.Meryl Streep as Mrs.Grahams and Tom Hanks as Bradlee is a dream cast for any movie on the same subject; yeah it's not a dream anymore! There's nothing more to comment on their acting or Spielberg's direction, they're proven masters of this trade. The way Streep and Hanks make their acting seem so effortless presents a true befuddlement. When it comes to the other master, there's a specific purport, dignity, intrigue and mastery in his storytelling, as always. Nowadays, only in a Spielberg movie can you spot a neatly executed Dolly zoom, trolley movements and classic close-ups. There'll definitely be Janusz Kaminsky, Michael Kahn and John Williams to his legendary squad, and so they are here. An impeccable army!Investigative journalism is one of Hollywood's widely dealt with topic; to pick some classic examples we have an 'All The President's Men', a Spotlight and a Zodiac-even the father of all well made movies 'Citizen Kane' is ultimately a movie on Press. 'The Post' begins off like a satire on 'Nam, and later takes off in a more linear direction. It's a known story, rather a page from renowned History textbooks; that's where the real challenge lies, to make an engaging movie on a story whose beginning and ends you already know, everybody knows. I believe Liz Hannah has achieved it hands down, credits to the rightful assistance meted out by Josh Singer, one of the men behind Spotlight, a rightful hire. Needless to say, the 'class' and the substance is only amped up by the hands of the big Master. From what happened in 'Nam, to what happens in the Post's unofficial Board Meetings, to what goes through the mind of a sensitive Mrs.Grahams, to what's going on in the White House and down even to Watergate, Spielberg has shown it all. We know the Vietnam War wasn't neither a big victory, nor short of a great number of casualties; it was a long kept Diplomatic Secret which left no more spaces to public negotiation; a terrible loss followed by inglorious consequences. To rationalise the ill sides of such an important event in History; to make it available to the Public is a sure buy for any seller, but an even riskier task for a journalist.Now, one may ask who really cares whether or not someone had made an age-old lie; one may ask why it needs to be discussed in the current world scenario? The world is getting torn apart by civil wars and mostly internal strifes, democracies are nearing a halt, nepotism is gaining a headway in all spheres, and totalitarianism is slowly finding its way back to immense adjacencies(even Disney bought Fox AF!). The face of the world is changing, and new currents are growingly apathetic to public expression and free press. This is where 'The Post' holds a contemporary relevance; this is an ode to unsung journalistic heroes, and a note of encouraging their good spirits. Such an important lesson to come from a classic team, 'The Post' is for times to come!!! Won't be surprised if it wins the Big Prize!????"

      "text": "This true story of the battle between the 1st Amendment and a paranoid Nixon administration and the cover up of papers that admitted in classified documents that the Vietnam War was a losing battle that could never be won, but kept dragging on because every President from Kennedy to Nixon did not want to be the one holding the bag for a lost war, the first one protesters and many Americans had already decided was a pointless genocide of innocent lives of civilians and American soldiers alike.    While the New York Times was the first paper to break the story after a \"source\" had managed to make copies of the multitude of pages of the criminal extension of the war and gave them to the NYT.    A court injunction swiftly followed, and the Nixon regime was hell bent on denying the American press the freedom to publish articles that he felt were incriminating to him.    Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep play the editor and publisher/owner of the Washington Post, which thanks to a fluke of timing, had escaped the dragnet Nixon imposed on the NYT because the Times scooped the Post.    The Post eventually got copies of the documents, printed part of them and found themselves in court, too.    The fight leading up to releasing these documents is the primary focus of the movie, with both sides having good arguments for running the story and not, with freedom of the press at stake if they didn't, and the possible total failure of the Post, which had just begun publicly trading shares on the American Stock Exchange.    It was widely known that Nixon and his henchmen were very dirty players, willing to do anything to protect the President.    Streep is always in fine form, playing Katherine Graham, who must make the final decision to run the first series of articles, and Tom Hanks as the editor Ben Bradlee, who is for publishing the article in the name of press freedom and the right to exercise press' obligations to expose wrongdoing and informing the nation or city where a smaller paper may be to its readers.    The acting is top notch, the tensions palpable, and for Spielberg, a somewhat modest screenplay but effective nonetheless.    What is disturbing is the fact that this type of journalism that took guts to even practice is sadly gone today.    Rather than big corporations being subject to being covered in the major papers if they did bad things, now major market media is totally operated by big corporations who decree every last detail what will be allowed to print in any paper or most internet sites, how it's slanted, or what is covered up.    When we live in a time when the New York Times won't even call Donald Trump a racist we know the fix is in.    Some maverick remnants of real journalism exist online, but now that internet neutrality is dead, it is a matter of very little time that providers will be pressured or paid to make access to web content the corporations that own them harder or impossible.    The only way to preserve our 1st Amendment is to practice it, and see \"The Post\" to see what real journalism used to be like."

Almost everyone in the film is well known for one project or another, and two of the greatest actors alive are playing the two lead roles. It is obvious that this was an all out attempt to win all of the awards, but surprisingly the film doesn't appear to be a favorite for really any of the major awards. And that's surprising to me, very surprising, because I found this film riveting from start to finish. The matter at hand couldn't be more relevant today, and the way Spielberg decided to present the story takes what could be a rather slow and boring film and turns it into a highly re-watchable film. I will say that I might be a bit more interested in the subject matter at hand than most people, which may factor into my fondness of this film, but I still think most people will enjoy it. 2018 is off to a good start."

      "text": "The Post tells the story of how the American press faced the dilemma of whether or not to publish the Pentagon papers, containing information about the Vietnam War that was withheld from the public. I thought this film was incredibly well acted, and as always Tom Hanks was excellent in this role. He really sold you his character, and brought a sense of realism to this amazing story. For a film where almost nothing action-happens save for the intro, the script was very well written and tied up all loose ends by the film's end. Meryl Streep played the owner of the Washington Post, and really portrayed the sense of naivety and shyness her character has at the beginning of the story (as a new businesswoman thrown into the deep end very well due to catastrophic circumstances) very well, and throughout the film you could really see her changing and adapting to the times, so by the end of the story she is an assured, sure-footed woman who knows what's best for her and her company, and this was a very satisfying arc and storyline. This film is extremely prevalent in today's society, as it explores themes of woman empowerment and the obvious political situation of 'fake news' and whatnot, and I think Spielberg struck the perfect balance between subtlety and over-doing it, as if one wanted to watch this casually as a film when bored, these serious themes wouldn't jump out at you and take your full attention. Speaking of Spielberg, he has yet again brilliantly helmed this movie, mixing longer takes with shorter ones and never keeping you bored, however I admit the second half of the movie picks up significantly and is much more involving and riveting than the first, although a film with this much backstory and context is bound to have necessary exposition and introduction. Overall, definitely see this movie, definitely for the story and then for potentially Oscar-nom worthy performances of Streep and Hanks (oh, and Bob Odenkirk was great too.)"

You lived through the exposure of the Pentagon Papers and the ruling of the Supreme Court\u2014as most of the members in the audience did\u2014yet as it comes closer and closer to the outcome you question yourself as to whether you remembered it right!\u201cThe Post\u201d shows that our current President wants to curtail what and which news reports on him, including what reporters, just as President Nixon did when, at first, the New York Times exposed the massive report on the Vietnam War and was challenged by him and brought to the court.\u201cThe Post\u201d tells the story of the Washington Post, whose owner Katherine Graham inherited the paper left to her husband by her father and she became the owner after the former committed suicide. The company is talking about going public and her decision to print the Pentagon Papers, started by the Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, a good friend of hers, could bring disgrace to him for continuing the indefensible war, she and her editor played by Tom Hanks could go to prison and the new shares of the company could be worthless.There is a lot of exposition to be told but Spielberg, along with writers Liz Hannah and Josh Singer, keeps the movie going until the story takes over with the decisions Graham must make, the actual showing how a newspaper is put together from setting the type to getting the paper in bundles and delivered. There is very little time wasted in this 1 hour and 55-minute movie that doesn\u2019t seem even that long!From Bruce Greenwood as Robert McNamara, Bob Odenkirk as the Post\u2019s managing editor Ben Bagdikian, Matthew Rhys as Daniel Ellsberg who  leaked the Pentagon Papers to the New York Times  reporter, along with other actors like Tracy Letts, Sarah Paulson, Bradley Whitford, Alison Brie, Carrie Coon among others get their time/moments to shine.Tom Hanks, as good as he is, fights the memorable Oscar-winning performance of Jason Robards as Ben Bradlee in \u201cAll The President\u2019s Men\u201d. I am not particularly a fan of Meryl Streep as I always see her \u2018acting\u2019 but in this movie, she becomes Katherine Graham.\u201cThe Post\u201d, in spite of the story, the actors and writers, is a Steven Spielberg movie from beginning to end, who at 70 seems to still have not reached his height yet!"

Everything about it was just, okay.Acting: Tom Hanks was definitely not the perfect actor for the role. Ben Bradlee was a meaner, cigar-smoking guy, yet whenever Hanks appears on screen, I see Tom Hanks. He does try to fit the character more, but in the end, he's still Tom Hanks.Miscellaneous: The thing about this movie is that Spielberg obviously had to make 2 hours of talking interesting. Hence why most of the scenes in this movie involve choreography. In nearly every scene, people are circling each other or moving around in some way, to give the scenes energy that they would lack if they were just talking about newspapers. This makes it feel all the more unrealistic and even makes it feel like a play. Characters will often speak in perfect order, starting right after the last one stops. The whole movie is so Hollywood and polished that it feels completely unrealistic. I also felt it lacked complete emotional investment. Sure, seeing Meryl Streep shut down the men in charge who dislike her is great and all, but otherwise I never felt much tension, even with the intense movements.I did not love The Post, but it killed 2 hours and I don't feel they were wasted. It's worth watching just because it'll probably get a few nominations, and it is Spielberg after all. It's probably one of the most average, passable movies I've seen in a while."

Tom Hanks is the primary weakness in the film - his performance pales on comparison to Jason Robards' performance in All The President's Men. Bradlee was a much tougher, acerbic, dynamic figure than Hanks displays. And Sarah Paulson as Tony Bradlee is equally as weak. (As an aside, when she says she was \"sad\" looking at the picture of she, Ben, Jack, and Jackie, I wish Spielberg had gone the step further to explain WHY she was said - what happened on the boat - when Jack assaulted her, which was discussed so artfully in the recent HBO doc on Ben's life.) The other primary weakness is the Daniel Ellsberg role. Matthew Rhys is outstanding, but I wanted to know more about how and why he decided to leak the papers. (Especially given the recent actions of RealityWinner and Snowden.)  The Vietnam sequence in the beginning is wasted. Also, Bradley Whitford hams it up like he does in most roles, largely to negative effect. Meryl Streep really saves the film with an elegant, nuanced performance, though again, I would have loved just a bit more information about how a 45-year-old who never held a job in her life was able to transition in to the primary ownership role of the Washington Post."

Political parties and media corps have been in bed together since the country's inception after all. Look up Tammany Hall for an example from 1790. Also remember that we have been at war continuously for about a decade and a half now... Where was the \"heroism\" of the 2012 \"The Post\"? If that doesn't matter to you put on your horse blinders and prepare to be \"inspired\" by this Bezos funded prop piece."

The Post tackles the story behind the Vietnam War and the need to expose the truth! It is about Freedom of Speech and how newspapers are \"the draft of history.\" The movie is slow at first but escalates rather quickly."

It's like Spielberg is assuming we all have this understanding and refuses to put anything in layman's terms. Maybe even a short paragraph at the beginning to introduce the story or setting would have been nice. It was so boring that I left the cinema after half an hourand I'm a trained journalist with an interest in politics. Where's the drama? Where's the excitement? Is this what cinema has come to? Intellectual masturbation? Surely we go to the cinema to be entertained as well as informed. It's not so much the way the story is told as it probably couldn't be told any other way, its the fact that this subject has been made into a movie at all. I'm not saying I just want to see super heros pounding each other, but let's at least keep to the spirit of entertainment encapsulated within the birth of cinema."

The phone scene alone makes that clear as day. And thank you Ann Roth for that glorious caftan. There\u2019s a reason why the 1st Amendment is 1st y\u2019all."

Limping to a measly $27M which won't even pay for the principal cast let alone full production. Way to go America for ignoring political hate messaging!"

As we watched this movie, it's incredible how the tension builds even though we know what's going to happen. I was reading the negative reviews of this movie, and it's quite obvious which side we lean on when giving a review for this movie. I wish people had honorable convictions in real life as they appear to have in this movie. Even if the people they are recreating in this movie didn't do everything the movie says they did, I wish they had. So for us, it was a wonderful movie about people's integrity and what they do about it. Our 23 year old was amazed at what life was about without cell phones, without electronic data, and how we used to publish papers. Finally, while the acting was good by all with much sincerity, Meryl Streep's role sure shows her merit as our greatest living actress since this isn't a showy role. Meryl has to convey emotions with subtle face expression and the tone of her voice. She truly gives us the feeling that she knows she's in over her head, yet hangs in there. This story has been made necessary to remind the public of how some politicians work against Americans."

      "text": "\u201cThe Post\u201d is the best kind of movie.  A thoughtful, erudite story, with a real sense of idealism and history, told in the best cinematic language.  This is Steven Spielberg\u2019s finest work, the movie that proves him to be a real auteur.  The performances are uniformly excellent, with Meryl Streep\u2019s remarkable rendering of Washington Post publisher Katherine Graham possibly the best work of her long and distinguished career.  Tom Hanks perfectly captures Ben Bradlee\u2019s charismatic personality, gravelly voice and vocabulary, and the zest for journalism and for life that dominated and shaped his career.  Everything is right about this film, it is exquisitely paced, lovingly detailed, and equally moving, funny and thrilling.  That it is subtle in such wonderful ways, at a time when there is very little subtlety or care in storytelling on screen, makes \u201cThe Post\u201d a rarity to be cherished.  It also makes it, in my opinion, the best film of the year."

      "text": "\u201cThe Post\u201d stars Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks in this bio-drama written by Liv Hannah and Josh Singer and directed by Steven Spielberg. This film is more than the story of the publishing of the infamous Pentagon Papers for it relates to the role of Kathryn Graham, the first female publisher of a major newspaper, and the culture that brought her to that position, as well as the basic issues of press freedom and whether any one person in government can be more powerful than the media and its position in our society. Ms. Streep, as Mrs. Graham, and Mr . Hanks. as Ben Bradlee, render superb performances as protectors of the public\u2019s right to know. For anyone growing up in this era and for those who are unfamiliar with the events of the time, it is a story well told as Mr. Spielberg educates and entertains the audience. For all of those reasons. I give the film an 8.0 rating and recommend that it be viewed by as many as possible."

      "text": "If you don't remember or don't know the story behind the Pentagon Papers, look it up. This movie outlines the debate by the Washington Post about printing those revelatory documents. Meryl Streep plays the paper's publisher, who must make the decision that risks the future of her business. Tom Hanks gets to be a bit gruff as the editor who fights for freedom of the press. Streep plays a subdued character, but still subtlety broadcasts every moment of doubt, as well as her discomfort with her treatment as a woman. The story is compelling and director Steven Spielberg sometimes uses swirling camerawork to create tension. On the other hand, the political debate sometimes seem repetitious and the film takes too long to get to the conclusion. Overall, this film serves as a fascinating history lesson told in a compelling manner."
