Since Katie is female, the adjective \"solo\" should also agree and be \"sola\", so the entry should read \"viaggiando sola\"."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "When we think we've seen a bit of everything in horror, comes a movie that surprises us with something new. It can be good or bad, better or worse achieved, but has the added value of novelty. This is one of this cases: movies about haunted houses come in droves, but movies about haunted ships is something different. The director (Steve Beck) and screenwriter (Mark Hanlon) did a reasonable job and got a very interesting story, without the dead times and gratuitous violence that infest the actual horror films. The cast, headed by Gabriel Byrne and Julianna Margulies, also did a decent job, although I believe that Byrne would be able to admit that this was not one of his best films.Blood abounds, there are scenes able to revolve the stomach and times when we really got stuck to the screen, but its not an overly graphic film. Everything rests beautifully in a slightly blurred picture, a very threatening and gloomy environment discreetly accentuated by sound effects. The decadent scenarios of the ship were designed in the smallest details, and are elegantly compared to their \"original\" aspect, through the use of a kind of \"hallucinations\" that closely resemble temporal flashbacks. One of the most impressive moments of the film, however, is its opening scene. Its something that we simply are not expecting to see. The end is not as strong because we, from the middle, can predict some of the key points in the outcome, removing impact to the climax. In the middle of the film, the director and screenwriter were lost, revealing themselves unable to better develop the plot.I confess that this film impressed me when I saw it for the first time. I loved it then, and it still is one of my favorite horror movies, by its potential and its scowling environment more than by it's quality. Not a great movie, its not a work of art, but its entertaining and gives some nice chills."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Anachronisms The handgun Francesca uses right before her death is a model that didn't exist in 1962.

The inspired script by Mark Hanlon and John Pogue offers a few neat twists as well as a valid reason for why the salvage crew can't simply just leave the ship once they realize something is seriously amiss. The sound acting by the tip-top cast helps a lot: Gabriel Byrne as crusty captain Murphy, Juliana Margulies as the gutsy and resourceful Epps, Ron Eldard as the rugged Dodge, Desmond Harrington as antsy greenhorn Ferriman, Isaiah Washington as the easygoing Greer, Alex Dimitriades as smartaleck Santos, Karl Urban as the scruffy Munder, and Emily Browning as helpful ghost girl Katie Howard. The luscious Francesca Rettondini slinks it up nicely as sultry singer Francesca. Kudos are also in order for the excellent art direction, Gale Tattersall's glossy cinematography, and John Frizzell's shivery score.

To discover halfway throughout the movie that one of the main characters, Jack Ferriman, is actually a sub-servant of Satan himself is just too damn far-fetched, even for the most optimistic viewers.

Also it was a lovely surprise to see a young Emily Browning.However, the movie itself is filled with problems. The visual effects are outdated, some of the acting is a bit iffy, and I feel like the director who previously made 'Thir13en Ghosts' the year before, just made the same movie but this time it's on a ship.I find it really annoying how early 2000's horror movie, for whatever reason, has a heavy metal soundtrack to it.

It opens very strongly with a brutal and scary opening sequence. It does look good, with a good and atmospheric vessel setting and the effects are much better than the cheap and over-used ones I was actually expecting. The ghost is sexy yet quite frightening as well, there are definitely some nice jumpy and suspenseful moments. As well as some good photography, decent direction and a spooky but not obvious music score. The acting overall is better than average, Julianna Margoyles has the most interesting character and she is very good here. The support cast support her solidly, especially Karl Urban, Issiah Washington and Alex Dimitriades. Ron Eldard is also good though he does have some of Ghost Ship's worst lines, while Desmond Harrington has a brooding presence if occasionally a too obvious.Gabriel Byrne is somewhat of a disappointment though, he seems to be aware that his character isn't in a lot of the movie and he doesn't seem to be making of an effort as a result. The script does have poor moments, coming across as stilted and clich\u00e9d, while apart from Margoyles the characters are never realised fully. The story gave me a mixed reaction, it does have a great tense atmosphere and some nice creepy moments, plus it does deserve plaudits for not being completely predictable, but it is sluggishly paced a little too often and while creepy apart from the opening sequence there is never anything particularly scary. The last 30 minutes are underwhelmingly silly and the only scene really that I'd consider predictable.Ghost Ship does have its faults, but overall it is a decent movie with a good atmosphere, decent acting and a great opening sequence. I just wish the pace, script and ending were better and that I learnt more about the characters. 6/10 Bethany Cox"}, {"rating": "6", "text": "The beginning and the end of this movie is really the only good thing about the movie.
