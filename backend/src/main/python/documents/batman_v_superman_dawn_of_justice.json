The redundancies fly high, from stopping an alien who destroyed a city....by destroying a city; to Luthor knowing way too much because he apparently traveled to normal Earth and stole the BvS script.\r Despite the runtime being too long, it still isnt enough for Znyder to make a coherent set-up for the Justice League.

There is no quick cameo on Earth thats good enough to save a 150-minute mess though....\r Also, I can't imagine any kid going to see this and not being bored to tears...if it was made for comic fans, then they should've dropped the PG-13 rating."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "I wanted to love Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. So badly. Although my expectations were low, I hoped for the best, and all I wanted to do was to have fun.\r I underestimated this movie. I underestimated how bad it would really be.\r Batman v Superman introduces a semi-interesting Batman, presents a few cool visuals, and the story itself has some ideas in it that have potential. However, the script itself is a mess, being one of the worst screenplays in terms of structure that I have seen in recent memory. The movie has about seven storylines going on all at once, none of which tie together in any cohesive way, and none of which get enough screen time to be developed or interesting. Here, characters feel empty and shallow. Ideas are silenced by explosions. Potential future storylines are wasted.\r After enjoying Man of Steel, and being a fan of the genre, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is one of the biggest letdowns in cinematic history. It's messy, tonally confused, often times unintentionally funny, and every bit as much boring.\r When the film was first announced at Comic-Con a few years ago, the sheer epic nature of the announcement had me in giddy tears.

Batman is a moronic jerk who prefers to destroy stuff than being reasonable. Superman doesn't do much aside from looking sad. Wonder Woman is just there so Warner Bros can have more toys to sell. Lex Luthor is a spoiled brat with with way too much time on his hands. You could remove several sequences and it wouldn't make any difference.\r With the exception of Jesse Eisenberg, who was embarrassing to witness, the actors looked like they wanted to be anywhere else. I can't say I blame them.\r Not even the action scenes live up to the hype. They're awkwardly staged and sometimes it's hard to tell what's going on (the cinematography is too dark). The music is laughably overdramatic.\r It's sad how Warner Bros has been working with these characters for ages and can't make a competent crossover movie with them.

The whole fight between Batman and Superman was less then 5 minutes and 90% of the fight was in the trailers already, the longggg build up with the pointless bullet plot was boring, it was just a mess. Affleck is one amazing Batman, have to give credit where its due, but Cavill is still a horribly wooden Superman, and surely I dont need to mention how painfully awful the new Luthor is, i actually turned my head away in the cinema to avoid the cringe he provides to the story. The setting up for other films was so lazily done and stupid, did Lex design there logos too in this universe lol? Speaking of stupid, Lois Lane gets saved like three times during the film, she is so irritating and pointless. The final act with Doomsday, the disgusting ugly troll was just filled with CGI explosions, nothing about it made sense, from how he became real to why they even used him in the first place, such a wasted opportunity if you know what he looks like and can do in the comics. He has a second form where he does nothing new and pebbles come from his back too, so theres that. Superman does 'die' and what a dreadful mistake to make, killing him off this early is beyond idiotic for obvious reasons, but we all know he isnt going to stay dead which means using the death of Superman for another film in the future is going to have no emotional impact whatsoever. Overall the film is a rushed mess, there was some nice cinematography and as i said before Batfleck is great but all this film did was waste my money, biggest disapointment in years."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "The hate for this movie is really unjustified. Is it flawed? Sure. But what movie isn't. We should be glad that we were given the chance to watch a superhero movie that doesn't follow the same old  formula, which in my opinion is getting quite repetitive, and is something different both in tone and story. The fact that the movie reminded me of Batman TAS and Superman TAS is definitely a plus.\r Let's start with the performances, everyone from the main cast to the supporting worked well, the stand out being Ben Affleck. Not only did he prove the haters wrong, but he brought something new to the role. For once you actually fear the Batman. Cavill was good as well, and you could really feel his pain of being an outsider (which is continued from Man of Steel). Amy Adams was much better this time around in her role as Lois Lane, and she again reminded me of Superman TAS. Jeremy Irons was obviously great as Alfred. Gadot in my opinion was alright as Wonder Woman, I guess we need to see more from her. Now let's come to Lex Luthor... instead of feeling like a man of grace and one that you should fear, Lex feels like a wannabe Joker, it felt like Jesse was playing a cartoon cartoon and it is quite clear that he needed a paycheck. But if you ignore the character's roots, he is a decent enough villain even if you would like to punch him every time he's on screen.\r The pacing although not great, was not terrible either. It was quite noticeable that a few scenes were cut in between and maybe the R-rated cut should help with the movie's flow. There were also quite a few choices made by the filmmaker that would anger quite a few fans. But this is something to be expected from Zack Snyder.\r Overall the movie was quite enjoyable, it had some really amazing parts and some that you would outright hate. But these parts really didn't ruin the experience for me, because at the end of the day it is someone else's interpretation of these heroes. I'm just glad that we were able to watch these two iconic heroes on the screen together.\r This is my own opinion and you should make your own. Watch the movie if you are interested but don't let the critics have an effect on your viewing experience because it definitely isn't the abomination that some would like you to believe. Although far from a perfect superhero experience, it is in my opinion better than quite a few thing that we have seen before. Maybe in the next couple of years, people might appreciate it more."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "For all its controversial casting choices, it isn't Ben Affleck or Gal Godot that drags this movie down, it's Jesse Eisenberg's ridiculous Lex Luthor. His pointless yammering represents the film as a whole; it has a few good moments and plays with a few interesting ideas, but there's no there there. The real blame for this mess, though, lies on the people who made it.\r The movie suffers from the excess of characters usually reserved for the third, bad film of a superhero trilogy. Did a movie about Batman vs Superman really need Lex Luthor? Probably not. Did it need a CGI wasteland with Doomsday at the center? Definitely not. And while this was a passable Wonder Woman, the forced inclusion of Superman's wife and mother, both dithering about pointlessly with cringeworthy dialogue, is unlikely to placate whatever portion of people looked at a BvS movie and thought to themselves \"this needs more women\". The excess of characters leaves little time for the movie's central conflict, with Batman's one-note rage coming off as hollow.\r Even more time is wasted on CGI fakery (whereas the smart blockbusters, Batman movies included, go hard for real locations and practical effects), and the hallmark of lazy writing: excessive dream sequences. And for all the stakes this movie purports to have, the ham-handed introduction of the Justice League leaves little doubt in the viewer's mind that regardless of how many explosions we see, everyone will be back for the next movie.

The addition of Wonder Woman and Doomsday is unnecessary and only adds to the convolution. That remains me, the actress who plays Wonder Woman is atrocious. The only actor who did a good job was Ben Affleck. It is a shame that Batman and Superman are unlikeable psychopaths.

When the movie approaches the end you have lot of actiongasm that works for everyone but that is so artificial that you should better watch video game cinematics on youtube. Snyder managed to take away the soul of the Dark Knight comics in favor of a shallow fight and managed to completely waste Doomsday, I mean, Doomsday is only there as \"geekgasm enhancer\", like the Wonder Woman (to present her without a deep context is just so shallow it hurts). Overall this is what all this film was about, a lot of nothingness followed by shallowness, it completely fails as a movie and fails to please me as a fan, the only thing this movie is good for is to teach people nihilism or even make teenagers go to the church looking for god after such an empty experience.\rSeriously, do not waste your time watching this.

Amazing action scenes, bats is an older version that is clearly on the edge after fighting crime for 20years. I don't get what more you could ask for in this film, there were some poor editing of scenes near the end and Jessie Esienberg was a bit dung but everyone else nailed it, Wonder Woman is a bad ass."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "The movie is really cool, is the best adaptation of a comic book and seen, Ben Affleck is the best Batman story and the film exceeded my expectations 10"}], "recommendations": ["percy_jackson_sea_of_monsters", "justice_league", "terminator_genisys", "spider_man_3", "x_men_apocalypse", "man_of_steel", "the_chronicles_of_narnia_the_voyage_of_the_dawn_treader", "the_twilight_saga_breaking_dawn_part_2", "the_twilight_saga_eclipse", "green_lantern", "indiana_jones_and_the_kingdom_of_the_crystal_skull", "the_twilight_saga_new_moon", "superman_returns", "dark_phoenix", "fantastic_beasts_the_secrets_of_dumbledore", "bumblebee", "teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles", "the_new_mutants", "glass", "batman_the_killing_joke", "riddick", "the_hobbit_the_desolation_of_smaug", "black_panther_wakanda_forever", "seventh_son", "avengers_age_of_ultron"]}
