One minute they are having a gag sequence on farts and the next they are talking about two scorpions mating on a person's head. It could have been good if they hadn't gone slapstick. Didnt appreciate the animated sequence where the adult takes off his clothes because of some plant pollen and you see his bare buttocks. Totally unnecessary.  Not the dora you watched with your preschooler.  Felt like in some places it was a total spoof film and other places it had potential as an action film. Really glad I saw it before my cousin took her 4year old to see it. It was a disappointment."

Just like \u201cKicking and Screaming\u201d or \u201cThe Boss Baby\u201d\u2019there are some dark, mature or well-written jokes that in no way belong in a PG flick, and I laughed more here than many recent films. It actually pays tribute to the animated series (which I watched as a kid) in very clever ways (think \u201cSponge Out of Water\u201d) and anyone downvoting on here saying otherwise hasn\u2019t actually seen the film. I don\u2019t know, I enjoyed it."

C'mon, let's be real.Depending on your own cynicism and interest it's how you will find some relevancy in this film. Otherwise I think it's quite obvious that you know very well where you're getting yourself into."

Who honestly thought that portraying Dora as a teenager would be a good idea? It has a dumb script, scenes that don't make sense and cheap humor mainly aimed towards little kids..... honestly, very boring and not something I would spend 1.5 hours on. But again if there's nothing else to watch and you just want to make fun of it, it has a lot of material to choose from"

      "text": "A live-action interpretation that's as truly confusing as it is confused itself, \"Dora And The Lost City Of Gold\" neither establishes a consistent world, nor effectively communicates a true vision for what it's supposed to be, how everything within it is supposed to be treated, or why it's all supposed to be funny. Seriously, what is going on here? Why is Dora so drastically different from everyone else, including her parents, who are two seemingly normal human beings? Why would you even bother entertaining the notion that all of the television adventures we've seen over the years are fantasies, when you have an actual,  anthropomorphic Swiper The Fox existing in what we're supposed to believe is \"the real world?\" Why does everyone view Dora with such disdain and derision but treat the talking fox and blue and yellow monkey as just naturally occurring elements in existence itself? What is going on? They're clearly trying at some sort of parodic treatment of the material, yes, but they're also implementing some elements of the show unironically, ultimately making it feel like a soulless hodgepodge of ideas you've seen done better and more consistently in movies like \"The Brady Bunch Movie\" and \"Christopher Robin,\" two very different movies with very distinct rules in play for their respective worlds. This movie wants to do all of the above and it's simply asinine. One of the more excruciating testaments to the power of having a singular vision in the writer's room."

      "text": "It's one thing to slip in jokes only adults will get, as in Jim Carrey's Grinch movie. It's another thing to slip in cynicism and events that will create awkward moments between parent and child at the movies. The woman cast as Dora is as perfect as a real person can be in the role. However, the story at times edges from sincerity into mocking the character, as when she comes across a plant with a long scientific name and says to the camera, \"Can you say [insert long unintelligible scientific word with about 20 syllables here],\" clearly intending to mock the cartoon Dora who teaches kids new words.My almost-5-year-old daughter loves the cartoon, and the movie was heavily promoted during the cartoon show on TV, so of course I assumed the movie would be for the same age bracket. It is not. It is full of poop and fart jokes. It also left me having to explain to my daughter what hallucinogenic drugs are and \"why that man took his clothes off.\" Not to mention the concept of 'mating' which I had planned to introduce my daughter to at a later age. The story itself, once you remove these unfortunate bits, is just OK.In short, not appropriate for the littlest kids, i.e. those who likely most enjoy the TV show. A bit snarky and cynical with a Dora who seems perfect except that they made her such an intense pollyanna the mocking is unmistakable.Also could have done without the woke interpretation of Moby Dick as \"appropriating indigenous blah blah blah.\" I had thought it was about a man obsessed with a whale."

Eugenio Derbez\u2019s role is not something u would expect, so, no spoilers about that. Also, expect some cute callbacks to the original \u201cDora The Explorer\u201d cartoon in the opening scene and during an important scene in the movie. Also, while we don\u2019t hear much from Danny Trejo as Boots The Monkey, I will say that Benicio Del Toro as Swiper the Fox was genius casting and I really enjoyed his performance, especially when he utters the famous phrase \u201coh man\u201d.Overall, a charming fun surprise in the end of the summer that you should all check out. I\u2019m gonna give this a 10/10. 5 out of 5 stars. \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f"

      "text": "\"It's easier when you're alone.\".( 30/100 ).Si sigo viendo y rese\u00f1ando este tipo de pel\u00edculas me van a tomar como un espectador muy exigente y odioso. Dora me deja resignado y, al mismo tiempo, reflexivo en ciertos aspectos. Quitemos la escarcha: Las actuaciones son muy malas e invisibles, la narrativa aspira a ser un episodio extendido de cualquier programa de Nickelodeon con s\u00edntomas de que ser\u00e1 cancelado, la m\u00fasica tambi\u00e9n es invisible y los efectos especiales son de bajo presupuesto. Sin embargo (con cierto \u00e9nfasis para cuidar mi imagen propia y no convertirme en el Comic Guy de los Simpsons), el film mantiene un animo alegre y positivo que cualquier raz\u00f3n de molestarse por pagar para ver un episodio de relleno de Dora La Exploradora en el cine se resbala f\u00e1cilmente. A lo que me refiero es que a pesar de lo idiota del personaje de Nicholas Coombe, lo pesimista de Jeff Wahlberg, lo inmadura de Madeleine Madden y lo molesto de Eugenio Derbez todo es bien mediado por la ingenua pero positiva chispa de Isabela Moner. No, su actuaci\u00f3n no es mejor que la de los dem\u00e1s, pero carga con un personaje escrito justo para anclar al p\u00fablico. Por lo tanto los acompa\u00f1antes de Dora tienen tan poco incentivo que el positivismo y cosmovisi\u00f3n de ella es suficiente para entretener a los ni\u00f1os sin hacer molestar a los adultos. Es pr\u00e1cticamente lo \u00fanico que puedo rescatar. Tambi\u00e9n quiero dar una menci\u00f3n honor\u00edfica a la escenograf\u00eda, por ser din\u00e1mica y \"realista\", sin embargo lo que admiro es la capacidad del estudio en recrear un ambiente as\u00ed de grande y no la calidad de la producci\u00f3n. En fin. Dora no es nada que los ni\u00f1os no puedan ver en la televisi\u00f3n o en sus tabletas y nada que los adultos vayan a disfrutar plenamente, pero los ni\u00f1os se la pasar\u00e1n bien y los adultos no la sufrir\u00e1n mucho.-If I keep watching and reviewing this kind of films, people are going to take me as a very demanding and hating spectator. Dora leaves me with resignation and, at the same time, reflexive in some aspects. Let's take off the frost: The acting is very bad and invisible, the narrative aspires to be an extended episode of any Nickelodeon program with symptoms of a future canceling, the music is also invisible, and the special effects are low budget. Nevertheless (stressing enough to take care of my self-image and not becoming the \"Comic Guy\" of The Simpsons), the film manages to keep a happy and up-beat soul that any reason of getting mad for paying to watch a filling episode of \"Dora The Explorer\" in the cinema slips easily. What I mean is that it doesn't matter how idiot is the character of Nicholas Coombe, how pessimistic is Jeff Wahlberg, how immature is Madeleine Madden and how annoying Eugenio Derbez is, all is well balanced by the naive but positive sparkle of Isabela Moner. No. Her acting is not better than the other ones but she carries a character written just for holding the public. Therefore, since Dora's friends have so few incentives, her positivism and worldview are enough to entertain kids without bothering grown-ups. It's practically the only thing that I can rescue. I also want to give an honorific mention to the scenery, for being dynamic and \"realistic\", however, what I admire is the ability of the studio to create an environment that big, and not precisely the quality of the production. Any way. Dora is noting that kids can't see on the TV or in their tablets and nothing that grown-ups will enjoy fully, but kids will have a good time and grown-ups won't suffer it too much."

      "text": "Such a confused and misguided movie. In effort to bring Dora into a more realistic world free from things like talking backpacks, this live-action update establishes that all of the events from the TV show were imagined by the protagonist and her cousin Diego when they played pretend together as children, and proceeds to make fun of its animated counterpart from that point on. An idea that almost works. At least until the film breaks its own reality by including an anthropomorphic fox in a mask. A fox we are clearly shown Dora and Diego imagining at the start of the movie. Yet neither of them even react in the slightest to seeing it stand before them in the flesh. Or that he's talking. Which is messy to say the least.The humor is very hit or miss. Things are at their most consistently humorous and entertaining when Dora goes to the city after years spent living in the jungle and has to navigate the intricacies of highschool. This is where I wish the movie had stayed as it was really on to something there. Unfortunately, it takes it takes a bizarre left turn and we end up back in the jungle on some sort of Indiana Jones-esque adventure where we are then ferried from one tonally incoherent setpiece to next and it seems like the movie loses all grip on what it wants to be before culminating in one of the most poorly choreographed musical numbers I've ever seen.It's definitely a cute film, but the vision behind it seems so muddled and even self-contradictory that all I feel is confusion and disdain. Little kids on the other hand are likely going to love this for all of its silly humor. I'd challenge those youngsters to revisit it in a few years though, as I doubt that they'll find much value in it when they're older."

Throughout the movie Dora is developed to be the cartoon character, but in real life, a fun take on the character, especially when she turns to the audience and asks them to spell out a word. Showing this character get to grips with high school was very funny and interesting. But then they start changing what they want it to be. Love plots appear out of nowhere, with Dora's cousin Diego falling in love with stuck-up top of the class girl stereotype, and one other strange one with nerd boy stereotype falling in love with Dora, but nothing ever actually happens because of this, all the cast seem to ignore it. They try to make the film funny, and succeed some of the time, but then also try and force morals down the audience's throats. The cast is brilliant, Isabela Moner captures Dora's constant upbeat attitude perfectly, and Diego becoming a regular teenager is very well done. Dora's dad is played by Michael Pena, who I think the makers of the film saw being funny in Ant-Man and other films so cast him and left big holes in the script that probably said \"MICHAEL DOES FUNNY THING HERE\". Because of this, he's wasted on a really unfunny joke where he explains what rave music is to Dora. I think with a clearer idea/plan and some slightly better writers, Dora could make for a really good movie."

I was surprised that the film got 84% approval on Rotten Tomatoes and negative reviews from the audience. The film is quite fun, has charismatic characters and a very interesting story. (Estilo sess\u00e3o da tarde). I thought the jokes about the drawing itself were great, which basically bring the main character's traits to our reality and that that would be considered strange. (Who would look at nothing and say: Can you say \"Delicious\"?). Amazing! Isabela Merced is wonderful as Dora, but Madeleine Madden is my favorite as Sammy. Even if the joining of the four characters is a bit forced, it is beautiful to see them helping each other throughout the film. I loved the music. It doesn't get out of my head. : 3 About the carelessness they had with the children about the mating jokes, the plants that cause daydreams and etc. Here in Brazil, the film had an indicative rating of 10 years. So it's kind of weird to take children ages four and five to the movies. ^^ (But I still understand foreigners. At least a little.) In short: The film is fun, welcoming and a good pastime."
