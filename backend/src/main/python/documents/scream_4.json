      "text": "To start, I am a massive \"Scream\" trilogy fan, but my thought in going in was that \"the franchise has had it's time and this is completely new, a new trilogy\". The film rewrites the rules of the first trilogy, and one of the most evident changes comes in the opening scene, in which 2 characters, 1 male, 1 female are killed. This scene will be seen as either boring and long-winded, or completely genius; my belief being the latter. It excited me and shocked me, without ever leaving the viewer lost, and in it's last moments (while giving a violent nod to a famous death from the 1st film) becomes the most violent and aggressive pre-title scene from all 4 films. Following a couple of misleading \"jumps\" and a little exposition, with the original 3 survivors positions all being developed quickly and efficiently, it isn't long before the film delves into the \"who's next?\" pace. With the standard \"CiCi/Candy\" kill being presented, in this movie as a more intelligent, brutal killing (and a particularly active Sidney Prescott facing off with 'Ghostface'), the movie already feels very different to it's predecessors. The kills are creative, quick and in heavy supply, and the list of suspects is soon whittled down, leading to the most shocking, well-acted, and at times hilarious conclusion that leads the viewer asking \"When is Scream 5 coming out?\".The overall game is still same, but the rules are so different that this movie is the most dramatic of the lot. Roll on 5."

      "text": "The series that refuses to die.  Most horror movies have been going down hill for years so I'm glad they took another stab at resurrecting the SCREAM franchise - why not?!  Big stars, decent twists and lots of blood will almost always equate to big box office bucks and SCREAM 4 adequately mocks and embraces the horror genre all at the same time.  It's a little cheesy and too self-referential for it's own good (which is the idea; although I'm not sure they intended to be as over-the-top as it is) - but it mostly knows how to maintain  the suspense, occasionally entertain and, heaven forbid, be a watchable movie.  It won't bring back much life to a dilapidated genre - but it works.  If you're a fan of the series carve out a little time this weekend - you won't be disappointed."

      "text": "I was really quite surprised at how much I liked Scream 4 - I was honestly expecting another Scream 3, or worse. The franchise is probably never going to equal the heights of the first installment again, but miraculously, it still remains a hugely enjoyable series. Wes Craven thankfully got the three main players back again (four if you count Roger L. Jackson). Neve Campbell's Sidney Prescott still makes a likeable protagonist (even if you wonder why, after all she's been through, she doesn't arm herself at all times) and David Arquette's Sherriff Dewey and Courtney Cox's Gale Weathers are still entertaining. The cast of young newcomers including Emma Roberts, Hayden Panettiere and Rory Culkin all serve their purpose, either by dying horribly or as potential Ghostface suspects. So it's business as usual in Wes Craven's Scream world, and while the plot's a little too predictable, some of the self-referential winks to the audience a little smug and annoying, and the run-time a bit lengthy, the film's energy and Kevin Willaimson's sharp script keeps you entertained throughout (bucket-loads of blood and some good jokes don't hurt either). So it's not as good as the original (something the film itself even amusingly points out at one point), but I struggle to think of many (if any) other fourth films in a franchise that are this decent, and that still have something to say. Horror films, after all, have evolved (or devolved, depending on your perspective) over the last decade, with handheld horror mockumentaries, torture-porn and the seemingly endless procession of remakes giving Craven an Williamson ample ammunition for affectionate parody. Scream 4 is a much more satisfying conclusion to the series than its underwhelming predecessor, but unfortunately, Hollywood being what it is, I doubt Ghostface is gone for good..."

      "text": "When it was first released in 1996, the original 'Scream' was an intelligent, and fun horror film that gave the slasher genre a big boost of much needed energy.  'Scream 2' was an entertaining sequel that cleverly built upon what the original film started.  'Scream 3', although not as bad as some people say, was admittedly a bit of a let down.  So after more than 10 years of horror films in between, we have 'Scream 4', ready to dissect and poke fun at recent horror films (and the state of the horror genre in general) once again, and it turns out, it's pretty good!  If you thought this series couldn't get any more self-aware, you were very, very wrong.  'Scream 4' is a hall of mirrors to the horror genre. It is arguable that this film is self-aware to a fault (with constant references not just to other horror movies, but to past 'Scream' films as well). And this time around the comedy is turned up a few notches, which does take away a bit from some of the bloodshed.  But, if taken with a small grain of salt, this can still be a fun movie. So enough about the cons, and onto the pros. Although not as good as 'Scream', 'Scream 4' is about on par with 'Scream 2', and is admittedly an improvement over 'Scream 3'.  For starters, it has a decent amount of fresh faces to liven things up (Hayden Penattiere and Rory Culkin are two standouts).  Like before, the characters in the film all speak with clever, self-aware dialogue.  There are also a few reasonably suspenseful set pieces, and the who will get it next/whodunit angle still works well enough to keep you guessing throughout the film.  If these movies are not your thing, I would be surprised if this one changed your mind.  But if you do enjoy the 'Scream' films for what they are (entertaining and suspenseful horror-comedies), then give 'Scream 4' a try."

Courtney Cox and David Arquette were great in their parts, but then again, they always are. Emma Roberts blindsided me. I had no idea her acting abilities were to that standard, as I always remembered her from 'Unfabulous' or 'Hotel for Dogs'. She really played her part magnificently.

Its been a decade since scream underwhelmed everybody with its lacklustre third instalment and with a fourth on the way I was sceptical about how the fourth would go and how it would affect the introduction to the review I would to write about it.In my second paragraph, I can now write about how much I enjoyed the film and how I can now use my summary in that Scream 4 (or Scre4m)was \"great fun and I was pleasantly surprised\". I can't begin to tell you how true this statement is, the plot manages to weave a tidy little knot of a mystery that comes to a surprising and comical climax. The body count is large, making killings in this instalment come thick and fast. Though with a reduced age rating, scream 4 is far more gruesome than the previous threesome and a lot more in keeping with the current horror movie gore fest. To finish off the second paragraph of my review I will conclude that Scream manages to stick to its guns, but modernise itself not unlike the remakes it satirises.Paragraph 3 contains scenes of critical nature. Now the film is paced very well, however there are a lot of characters to get through. And despite its self aware nature the two-dimensional characters are so underplayed that its hard to feel much for them as they quickly get stabbed to death. The only characters you feel much dread for is Gale, Dewey and Sidney as familiar faces that you don't want to meet there bloody doom,however the new cast have so little characterisation that you really couldn't care less if their stabbed to death and left to dry on their parents lawns. The film also wasn't as scary as the original and despite the \"kids\" knowing the rules of the horror movie they were starring in they all seem to go outside to investigate a strange noise when they know they're all being hunted by a killer. Whether this is done on purpose, as to mock other horror films is a possibility, but to be honest it would make the film a lot less predictable if they didn't make there predecessors mistakes.So my conclusion is gonna be as sharp and concise as a horror movie should be. Scream 4 is entertaining, funny and thrilling. And one of the last lines of one of the survivors is bloody great."

The plot is pretty solid with a few blatant winks to the first film. The acting is mostly stellar (some hamming-it-up moments detract from the impact of the film in some instances) and the gore does not disapoint. Where does the film go wrong? Well, the opening sequence, in trying to be spectacular, kind of falls flat and turns out to be the weakest opening yet. It tries to take a stab at the ridiculous franchises out there that seem to fall apart as a new installment hits but doesn't take itself seriously enough in the moment, thus rendering it more of a Scary Movie type spoof than an actual slasher flick shocker. Still, the film delivers in thrills. And the pop culture references serve as a fun interlude to all the killing."

Not everyone shares the same set of criteria. If we did, what a bland and uninspired world this would be.\r What I Personally Liked About \"Scream 4\":\rUm. Give me a minute. I'm thinking. I'm thinking!!! It's saying something when even the normally reliable Neve Campbell seems like she's just going through the motions to grab a quick paycheck. Well, here's one thing I do like: Hayden Panettiere. She always deserves more credit than she receives and has the propensity to be a serious actress if given the opportunity. She's easily the best part of this sorry excuse of a \"film.\" I suppose Emma Roberts is okay, too. She's certainly not horrible, she just feels like she's holding back for some reason, even in the finale. She needs to learn to cut loose a little.\r What I Personally Disliked About \"Scream 4\":\rIt's hard to pick a place to begin with this one. I will say that the triple false opening is a mind-numbingly tedious experience that should have been scrapped. There is a lifeless pacing to the entire production and there are too many stretches that rely on cliches instead of actual substance. There are no really solid supporting characters. While a lot of the ancillary characters weren't exactly fully formed in the original trilogy, they were still more interesting and had more personality than the ones seen here. The relationship between Dewey and Gale that was so unbearable in the third chapter has become rip-your-eyeballs-out-of-their-sockets-so-you-don't-have-to-witness-it-anymore bad. But the biggest drawback to this film is the one missed opportunity that could have saved the entire movie: Sidney Prescott should not have lived. Seriously. This was a monumental oversight by the filmmakers that could have brought about something unique within the genre. Having Jill Roberts get away with murder could have opened new doors for the franchise. Focusing on how a serial killer secretly maintains her \"survivor\" fame while trying not to get caught killing future victims would have been a superb idea for a fifth installment. \"Scream 4\" should have ended after Jill beat herself up and was being carted out of the house through the flashing of the paparazzi. Fade to white. End of film. However, mediocrity reigned supreme, Sidney lived and the whole shebang wound up scraping the bottom of the cinematic barrel.\r My Overall Impression of \"Scream 4\":\rThis is an inconsequential sequel that exists solely to appease the almighty dollar. Why tarnish a decent legacy for the sake of being greedy? It never works out well in the long run. I guess, to paraphrase a line from the movie (which came from Dewey no less - ugh!), \"One generation's classic horror movie is another one's joke.\" This film is the joke and it is one that fails miserably."

It was one of the most ridiculous attempts at a horror film that I have seen. With no scares, and barely a few thrills (but 49 different plot twists to make up for it, unfortunately), Scream 4 just fails at being a horror and turns into a parody of itself and of the franchise it represents. Not remembering most of the previous Scream films, since I watched them a long time ago, I soon enough realised that there should not have been another Scream film in the first place. The desperation of the producers to get some more money out of the died franchise is obvious, when they are trying to \"re-invent\" the franchise through recycling old material but making it seem \"original\" and \"different.\" I ended up laughing at most of the film (I guess, at least it was entertaining in that regard), but also found myself palm-slapping myself a number of times because of how poor the screenplay was. It is basically a comedy and has nothing what a horror ought to have. It is a failed attempt to rejuvenate the franchise, which in my eyes, has utterly failed. Hopefully this will be the last of the Scream films."

      "text": "Funny, meta, and for once actually unpredictable, Scream 4, in my opinion, actually outdoes the original.  However, it's still hindered greatly by the fact that it's the fourth in the series, and the fact that horror movies have been satirized and spoofed for well over a decade now doesn't help it out much either.  There were parts of it that I actually laughed out loud at, and other parts where it actually got me nervous.  It wasn't terrifying, but I can live with that.  My main complaint is that it takes itself too seriously.  It too often just feels like another horror film.  Craven directs it confidently, but couldn't he give it a little more style, or make it a little bit more of a spoof?  4 movies in I wish the series would stop trying to mix actual horror with the laughs.  I'm not saying to make it like the Scary Movie series, but I feel that a lighter tone would have helped it out.  Still, I'm hard pressed to try and recommend any other slasher film over it.  I had a decent time with it, but not a great one."

      "text": "I remember seeing this opening night, which I'm happy to say was actually my best theatrical experience I've ever had. Within the first seven minutes the film brings meta-humor and self-deprecation to a new level, pointing out all of the supposed flaws that anyone could complain about and opening addresses itself with, \"It's been done to death... Stick a fork in 1996 already.\" The dialogue is witty and acerbic the entire time and all feels fresh and modern, which in itself is a huge accomplishment. Characters are completely believable as teens and the acting is actually great, specifically Hayden Panettiere who plays my favorite character: a dry, sardonic and sexy closeted film geek. The brilliantly orchestrated final act discusses modern society's obsession with technology and easy-found fame and the identity of the killer surprised me to no end; even being a die hard fan of the franchise and a cinephile, I didn't guess anything correctly. There are SO many red herrings that make you contemplate if something is too obvious, who was doing what when, and makes you double check yourself in regards to reverse psychology of believing who the killer is. The best part is that all but one of the cliches and tropes that are utilized for satire are subverted and/or openly acknowledged. The script justifies a character's seemingly stupid actions or flips it outright. Everything is shot well with good use of lighting as well as a good orchestral score and the directing is good (pay attention to the increasing corniness of the opening scene). It's actually the best of the series, better than the first with very clever kills and witty satire regarding torture porn, found footage genre films, modern horror, remakes and reboots. And yes, it scared the crap out of me. 9.5/10, incredible, two thumbs up, etc."
