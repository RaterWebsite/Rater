That may be in large part do to Octavia absolutely phoning in this performance. She's a FAR better actor than she is in this. 1/3 in and still no fights or laughs, which as an \"action comedy\" you'd kind of expect. McCarthy does her best, but her FAT-LADY-FALL-DOWN running gag stopped being funny a long time ago. The film also has a serious issue with logic too. The \"miscreants\" that get powers activated are also violent psychopaths... okay, but that doesn't really explain why they're a problem? Like, they have powers sure, but it's not like they're bulletproof. Why can't the police just, you know, shoot them. The movie is full of logical inconsistencies like this.The costume design is also, let's be real, is just terrible.A lot of people in these reviews are very much coming from dishonest people who straight up do not want movies staring plus size women and women of colour. The reality is though... it's just bad. It's just really, REALLY bad."

I want to cancel my Netflix account just because they thought releasing trash like this to people that willingly give them money for their service was the right thing to do. Please don't watch this. Melissa McCarty sucks, this movie sucks, and Netflix sucks for subjecting us all to it. 3/10. and that's being generous"

She's such a great actress with so much potential, yet we get a train wreck like THUNDER FORCE! This film was all I needed to determine that McCarthy's career may very well take a nose dive if she doesn't start dipping her feet into some untried waters! She's getting older, and we can see her aging in this film. She's gotta try something new."

He\u2019s helmed most of the recent films starring his wife Melissa McCarthy and they\u2019ve all been mediocre. This one co-stars Octavia Spencer, who plays McCarthy\u2019s best friend since elementary school. They end up with super powers. In addition to McCarthy playing her usual bumbling loser, there\u2019s lots of potential for physical humor. Sadly, neither of these opportunities is especially realized.  There are some mildly amusing moments for McCarthy, but no situations or lines are especially funny. Spencer just plays the straight woman without any potential for comedy. The action revolves around encounters with villains, but it\u2019s mostly just bodies flying thru the air. McCarthy needs to break out of her husband\u2019s mediocre abilities if she ever wants her movies to get better."

      "text": "Okay, Streamers, I accidentally watched another female-led superhero flick this weekend instead of that anticipated one from the MCU. Yes, I watched Thunder Force starring Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer, which was released on Netflix back in April. It's a nice, family-oriented action-comedy set in a world where supervillains called Miscreants run rampant. McCarthy and Spencer play estranged best friends, who reconnect in the midst of Spencer's character developing a treatment that provides superpowers to counter the evil Miscreants in order to avenger her parents' deaths.A new movie starring Melissa McCarthy and directed by Ben Falcone seems to come out every six months (Superintelligence was released on HBOMax in November 2020). She typically plays the main protagonist, who is an unhinged mess with a heart of gold. Usually, there is a more grounded foil to McCarthy's character, who puts up with her antics and builds a friendship despite all of the mess. Thunder Force follows that formula to the letter except there is the superhero twist this time. In that sense, there's really nothing to see here - the only additional development is that there are two middle aged women kicking butt, which is nice. They have some fun with that, but it's not something that's acknowledged much. Octavia Spencer does her best to keep up with McCarthy's high-wire comedy. Sandra Bullock was a better match to McCarthy in The Heat. I did like seeing Spencer in this mode even though it is not a natural fit - Ma was a better departure for her. I'll also mention that Jason Bateman has some very funny moments throughout.Meh.If you've seen one McCarthy/Falcone movie, you've seen them all and if you like them, then you may like this. Thunder Force is nice, inoffensive and has some funny moments, but there isn't anything special here. I'd say play it in the background if you are bored with just a handful of popcorn."

Algunas escenas realmente muy graciosas quedan medio perdidas, como sueltas, en una pel\u00edcula que parece decidirse m\u00e1s por la comedia sentimental que por la parodia y sale perdiendo.Rese\u00f1aUna radiaci\u00f3n c\u00f3smica convierte a algunos seres humanos en malhechores con determinados poderes. A\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, una cient\u00edfica y un amiga de su infancia de reencuentran y por accidente terminan formando un escuadr\u00f3n de superhero\u00ednas que se enfrentan a un candidato a intendente de Chicago.Melisa McCarthy y su esposo Ben Falcone (director y guinista) constituyen una dupla art\u00edstica con varios t\u00edtulos en su haber, basados en el carisma y la indudable gracia de la primera.En este caso, Fuerza Trueno parece un collage de dos pel\u00edculas diferentes que no terminan de combinarse: una comedia sentimental sobre el reencuentro de dos amigas (una exitosa, la cient\u00edfica Emily , a cargo de Octavia Spencer, y otra no tanto, Lydia, interpretada por McCarthy) y una comedia par\u00f3dica sobre dos superhero\u00ednas obesas de dise\u00f1o (cercana en estilo a la maravillosa Spy, tambi\u00e9n protagonizada por McCarthy pero dirigida por Paul Feig), . Es como si hubiera una indecisi\u00f3n por parte del director entre filmar una pel\u00edcula en serio sobre superh\u00e9rores o una parodia sobre ellos (una s\u00edntesis que si logra Shazam!, por ejemplo).Pero la parte \u201cseria\u201d resulta bastante anodina y uno queda, en cambio deseando m\u00e1s momentos graciosos, que los hay y mucho. Tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1n logrados las escenas de acci\u00f3n y sus efectos especiales.Contribuye al resultado general la actuaci\u00f3n de Octavia Spencer, que mantiene el mismo registro desganado durante toda la pel\u00edcula, con escasa qu\u00edmica con su coequiper; como si la comedia no fuese lo suyo. No tienen desperdicio, en cambio, las escenas con Jason Batman, que derrocha qu\u00edmica y gracia. (Spanish / English)A film that seems to decide more on sentimental comedy than parody and loses.SummaryFailed comedy with Melissa McCarthy and a reluctant Octavia Spencer as two designer superheroes. Some really very funny scenes are half lost, like loose, in a movie that seems to decide more on sentimental comedy than parody and loses.ReviewA cosmic radiation turns some human beings into evildoers with certain powers. Years later, a scientist and a childhood friend meet again and by accident end up forming a squad of superheroines who face a candidate for mayor of Chicago.Melisa McCarthy and her husband Ben Falcone (director and screenwriter) are an artistic duo with several titles to their credit, based on the charisma and undoubted grace of the former.In this case, Thunder Force looks like a collage of two different films that do not finish combining: a sentimental comedy about the reunion of two friends (one successful, the scientist Emily, by Octavia Spencer, and the other not so much, Lydia, played by McCarthy) and a parodic comedy about two obese designer superheroines (close in style to the marvelous Spy, also starring McCarthy but directed by Paul Feig),. It is as if there is an indecision on the part of the director between filming a serious movie about superheroes or a parody about them (a synthesis that Shazam! Can achieve, for example).But the \"serious\" part is quite anodyne and one is left, instead wishing for more funny moments, which there are and a lot. The action scenes and their special effects are also achieved.Contributing to the overall result is the performance of Octavia Spencer, who maintains the same listless register throughout the film, with little chemistry with her coequiper; as if comedy wasn't his thing. On the other hand, the scenes with Jason Batman, which exudes chemistry and grace, are not wasted."
