Puppy-dog eyes are my achilles heel, in other words. In the world of the absurd (and more specifically, the gothically absurd) Burton shines, and Depp's ability to just simply be anyone or anything makes this one perfect. No one can touch this one- I think it quite conclusively proves that Burton is the evil-genius we all hope he is."

Truely remarkable in every sense. Once I had watched it at a much younger age but still I could remember it fair enough but when I watched it again today I couldn't stop playing it till the end though I had other films waiting in line. I am writing for the first time for any movie, I couldn't stop myself."

The ultimate beautifully sad fairy tale that does not let go for days. R.D. and Ugly are right."

This is by far one of johnny's best performances and why I call him my favorite actor. If you haven't seen it give ti a watch, but if you have watch it again this movie merits re watches and I always catch something new that I didn't see the other times I watched it from the house getting bug bombed in the background to how well the sets and character comment on a slice of suburbia that I honestly can say i live in."

The title itself practically gives away the whole dull plot of this terrible movie, and I must say that I have absolutely no idea why a man with Johnny Depp's talents would resort to acting in it, and why anyone would like this trash... Why is the user rating on metacritic so high!? 'Edward Scissorhands' is another work of utter garbage from a most dreadful director/screenwriter in Tim Burton, who has not as of yet (and most likely never will) created a movie that is enjoyable to watch in the slightest. How can he still be allowed to write and direct movies for Hollywood, and how can anyone possibly bear to give him any compliments for his works of complete and utter crap!? The first time I watched 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' (the original) I wasn't particularly impressed, but after watching Tim Burton's feeble attempt at it (why was Johnny Depp in this one as well? Does he feel sorry for Burton or are they so closely related that his parents won't let him refuse his offers or something), I thought of the original as quite a masterpiece. I like randomness, in fact I think it brings in an amusing factor that is often needed in a movie, but Tim Burton's 'random' just adds more boring to his already tedious and nonsensical story-lines. Wasn't Beetlejuice supposed to be a comedy/horror movie...? Those are the best two combination to keep a viewer interested, but I actually fell asleep after just 15 minutes... ...and I'd gotten 14 hours sleep the night before!!! What made 'Edward Scissorhands' all the worse for me was that, after viewing it at school (I would never have watched it otherwise), our whole English class had to explore into the movies' depths and find out how it was made and how different stupid things had hidden meanings (things that Tim Burton himself probably didn't even think about when writing it). Delving into the movie itself did nothing to make me enjoy it any more, in fact it made the dreary experience just as bad as when I watched it in the first place (I mean it couldn't possibly get any worse!), it just took a hell of a lot longer to get through. So overall, 'Edward Scissorhands', worst movie ever, pointless plot, overly colorful, completely unfunny, totally unrealistic (which ties in with my last point, if the unrealism had a little humor it would have been okay, but scissorhands...? Scissorhands!? That's like something a Primary School Child would think is cool, until they GROW UP!!!), awfully directed and written (I hate you Tim Burton!), and even completely disgusting at times (what was that woman doing to Depp in the back room?). I wouldn't recommend this atrocity of a film to anyone with at least half a brain."

      "text": "From the wild and wacky mind of Tim Burton comes Edward Scissorhands, a tragic and charming look at a man with scissors for hands. A film that only Burton could make, his direction is as sound as usual and he manages to evoke considerable sympathy for this tragic figure who is, otherwise, a normal man but cursed to live his days with scissors as hands. Johnny Depp does a great job bringing this man to life and brings a certain tenderness and has fantastic chemistry with Winona Ryder when it comes to the romantic element of the film. The writing is incredibly strong and, together with Burton's direction, keeps this one reined in and keeps it from getting out of control when it easily could have with such a crazy premise. The characters are well developed and truly multi-dimensional. Edward Scissorhands' portrayal of suburban life also feels delightfully and quintessentially late 80s, early 90s and really serves as a perfect backdrop for the introduction of such a weird and unique person. Though I may be one of the few to have never seen Edward Scissorhands, it is truly timeless and will live on for a long, long time due to its fairy tale and thematic elements that really are universal and its ability to be both unique, yet incredibly stirring, tragic, and moving. This one is Tim Burton at his very finest."

A sort of comedy/romance kind of film starring Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder but will not give the story away because I'm sure most have seen it. However my opinion of this film is Winona Ryder as Kim looks beautiful in this film, infact she's the real highlight that stands out in the whole film for me!! Johnny Depp was clumsy but good as Edward Scissorhands and it's a funny but beautiful film. Great movie which would be good to watch at Christmas because of the scenes when it's snowing."
