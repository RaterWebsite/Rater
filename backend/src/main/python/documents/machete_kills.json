Some people will never ever say anything bad about the guy and some will genuinely like it, but to be honest.. it just didn't have that X factor the first Machete did. This time around Machete is more like a super hero. He is sent on a mission to Mexico by the President (excellent choice of casting Charlie Sheen, using his birth name of Carlos Esteves). But other than that, (and of course Danny Trejo and Michelle Rodriquez), the rest of the cast just didn't fit. The schizo Mexican revolutionary didn't fit, Cuba was completely out of place, wasn't really feeling Lady Gaga or Amber Heard (even though she is gorgeous) and the gorgeous Sophia Vegara was just a little too manic. But it really wasn't that.. the film just was kind of flat, even the action scenes weren't clicking. Maybe because they gave away too much in the previews. Maybe its because they made Machete inhuman.. All I know is that when I was in the theater, 3 people around me fell asleep and 4 people walked out a hour after the film started... AND it wasn't that many people in the theater. Gosh I wanted it to be so much better.. This is a rental, at best"

Director Robert Rodriguez has returned to grindhouse territory with over-the-top violence, hot women and cheesy special effects. His script is too often talky and the dialogue isn't that clever. Some of the action is inventive, while a lot of it is just noisy. The star-chocked cast doesn't go far enough into camp (again, blame the writing).  When this movie is good, it's loads of fun, but it's not as outrageous or inspired as the genre demands. NOTE: Stay thru the credits for 2 outtakes."

They just don\u2019t kill Machete (Danny Trejo), whom you\u2019ll recall from the first film survived a shot to the head when the bullet was blocked by another bullet, already lodged in his skull. Machete Kills continues director/co-writer Robert Rodriguez\u2019s penchant for outrageous plot developments performed by \u201cwhat-the?\u201d casting choices. Mel Gibson plays a villain straight out of a Bond film  Moonraker, to be precise. Charlie Sheen (listed in the credits by his birth name, Carlos Estevez) follows in his father\u2019s footsteps as the U.S. President. And Lady Gaga is introduced as \u201cwhoever she wants to be.\u201d Name your box-office poison. If Fatty Arbuckle were still around, he\u2019d have a cameo for sure. Yet somehow, the results work. That\u2019s probably because Rodriguez takes nothing seriously. The plot  which could fit on the back of a cereal box, but only the really sugary kind  involves a Mexican madman (Oscar nominee Demian Bichir) who wants the U.S. to clean up the corruption in his country, or he\u2019ll fire a nuclear warhead at Washington. (Apparently he\u2019s been reading Madman Tactics for Dummies.) President Sheen, or Estevez, or whatever, calls on Machete to help. \u201cYou know Mexico,\u201d he tells the taciturn strongman. \u201cHell, you are Mexico.\u201d Helping him will be a government agent played by Amber Heard. Her cover identity is beauty pageant winner Miss San Antonio, but has the operative gone too deep into character? In one scene she texts Machete: CU There!   More about the story I cannot reveal. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m against spoilers; I just wasn\u2019t sure what was going on most of the time, although whatever it is, it\u2019s as funny as a roadrunner cartoon and only about 2.5 times as violent. Machete faces off against La Camale\u00f3n, a shape-shifting assassin played by a bewildering array of actors (Cuba Gaga Banderas Jr., etc). He crosses paths with Desdemona (Sofia Vergara), whose 32F brassieres pack a 38-calibre punch. (You\u2019ll never guess where she keeps her backup firepower.) He hooks up with former partner Luz (Michelle Rodriguez), who sports a sexy eye patch and has a feminist revolutionary poster on her wall that reads Sh\u00e9. And he makes use of a road-tunnel under the U.S.-Mexican border, stolen directly from 2009\u2019s Fast & Furious. The movie runs for 107 minutes but features a ticking-clock timeline that allows it to pack more into 24 hours than, well, 24. And it opens with a fake trailer for Machete Kills Again  In Space! At least, I think it\u2019s a fake trailer. You may recall that the first Machete sprang from just such a bogus teaser, attached to 2007\u2019s Grindhouse. So while Machete likes to say \u201cMachete don\u2019t\u201d lines  Machete don\u2019t smoke, tweet, joke, etc.  the one thing Machete seems destined to do is return."

Great escapism over the top fun as well as a good parody of the grind house type films I saw as a teen in the 70's at local theaters both drive-in and otherwise.  My only complaint about this movie was the lack of gratuitous female nudity.  Hopefully Mr. Rodriguez will make up for this in the next installment \"Machete Kills Again... in space!\"  Looking forward to that one.  Ignore the negative reviews!  This is a fun, entertaining film; it doesn't take itself too seriously and nor should the viewer,  Watch it and enjoy!"

It tries (but fails) in any attempts at humor, has an uneven plot, and the action simply does not compare to the first one. Maybe some movies just shouldn't be done again.

The first movie was pretty watchable, but the joke was starting to get overused, you can't make a good movie out of a single gag (or at least Rodriguez can't). This time, the sequel has come very close to the line that separates a crappy movie from a mediocre one. Utter senselessness, poor visual effects, cheesy acting and stupid forced dialogues just don't go unnoticed.\rWho pulls this from the depths of awfulness are Michelle Rodriguez (she's hot), Amber Heard (she's even hotter), Mel Gibson (it's a shame he's had a blow to his reputation, he's still same ol' awesome Mel) and Charlie Sheen (because any movie gets better with jokes about Charlie Sheen and hookers or drugs).\rSo, Machete Kills is barely watchable and gets a very weak 4 out of 10, which is actually 3.5 rounded to 4, something like that. And considering the open nods to an even more ridiculous sequel set in space, things will get worse."

Dark comedies are fantastic (in my opinion) and Machete was just an unapologetic jumble of boobs, blood, guns and sheer ridiculousness.  However, the sequel fails to recapture that formula and, ultimately, ended up feeling like a parody or like someone was making fun of Robert Rodriguez and the first movie.  The jokes are terrible, the action is forgettable and the story is a sloppy excuse of a Grindhouse parody.  While some of the characters might have been intriguing or even awesome, Rodriguez wastes them and treats them like they are nothing more than filler to make the film get to a feature length.  The only saving grace is that Mel Gibson is incredible as the film\u2019s bad guy.  Other than that, the film was just a sequel that didn\u2019t need to be made\u2026but that\u2019s not shocking when you take into consideration that the film is a sequel to a movie that was created from a fake trailer."

      "text": "Isador Cortez, a.k.a. Machete, always had Danny Trejo\u2019s face since his first cameo in Robert Rodriguez\u2019s \"Spy Kids\" (2001), and has always been portrayed as an over-the-top caricature of the infallible action hero. His first sporadic appearances in different films were intended as Easter eggs and nod to the fans: the best known reference of all is the fake trailer included in \"Grindhouse\" (2007), by Tarantino and Rodriguez himself. It took Quentin\u2019s genius (but most of all his reputation) to raise the funds for a project that had been their forbidden desire for a long time: a so called \u201cb-movie\u201d, a low-budget exploitation film as in fashion in the \u201870s. Rodriguez jumped at the chance to give depth and notoriety to Machete, laying the foundations for what would later become the 2010 feature \u201cMachete\u201d, a critical, public and box office success.\rFormer Mexican Federal Machete is a living legend, a die-hard incorruptible law man, whose face is scarred by violence and whose soul is scarred by death and suffering. Armed with his inseparable and lethal machete, he is the perfect war machine that every villain fears but invariably tries (and fails) to kill. This time, his nemesis is Luther Voz (Mel Gibson), orchestrating an intricate plan to threaten humanity. Machete, personally hired by the funkiest President of the United States ever (a brilliant Carlos Estevez, a.k.a. Charlie Sheen, typecasted straight from his previous roles in the \u201cScary Movie\u201d saga), must travel across Central America to save the day. Alongside him, a number of disreputable characters follow one another while the plot unfolds. Enter hot secret agent Miss San Antonio, Vanessa Hudgens playing the prostitute, Mendez the Madman and his split personality, his bodyguard, corrupt Sheriff Doakes, Sh\u00e8 coming back with a bunch of guys from the previous film - and then this hitman, el Camale\u00f2n, who is actually four different people! Seriously? That\u2019s way too many characters for me to care about, especially given the standard of the film, in which everything is a farce built for Machete to destroy - while possibly maiming some limbs.\rAway from the dusty and western-like setting of the first chapter, Rodriguez shapes \"Machete Kills\" in a way that reminds me a bit of James Bond, and too much of \"Expendables\".  Rather unfortunate, for a film that tries hard to be cool, but ends up looking like any other average action feature. It is this strange ambivalence that makes \"Machete Kills\" hard to appreciate fully: a few scenes are memorable, and some are pure works of genius, but the uniqueness of a character like Machete is game-changing, and it soon becomes clear that he doesn\u2019t fit the genre\u2019s standards. His invincibile and illogic nature is the elephant in the room that makes everything else pointless. \u201cMachete Kills\u201d attracts its audience with promises of absurdities, silliness, and gratuitous gore; all this aside, it feels just like a 2-hour long cartoon, or an ice cream with a dozen scoops. After a while, you just get tired. That\u2019s not to say that the film isn\u2019t worth the ticket price: when written wisely, its episodic gags make the whole cinema laugh out loud, and the fake trailer for \"Machete Kills Again... In Space\" is one of the funniest things I\u2019ve seen in the last ten years. This is why Machete remains one of the cult icons of modern cinema, and just as I am ready to point out all the film\u2019s weaknesses, I\u2019m also impatiently waiting for the next sequel."
