Decent plot, some good CGI and a fair few twists and turns. I also feel it benefited from setting it in Africa rather than a western country.

The story is very cliche, the characters are not interesting at all, there are incongruous data (such as the fact that in one scene a robot resisted 3 missiles but then later people knocked it down), or a lot of unexplained things! Why did the ship capture people? How did the invasion start and why? Why was Bo locked in a cage? Why the robots choose him? Why did they put that \"device\" on? It is a shame! The only thing that more or less saves him are certain moments of action, but nothing more. I'm not saying that I can't get to entertain in some parts, but I can't recommend it"}], "recommendations": ["the_last_days_on_mars", "captive_state", "spectral", "monsters", "pacific_rim", "battle_los_angeles", "reign_of_fire", "sunshine", "predators", "alien_outpost", "riddick", "elysium", "aliens", "the_tomorrow_war", "kong_skull_island", "alien_covenant", "jurassic_world_fallen_kingdom", "daybreakers", "resident_evil_apocalypse", "world_war_z", "surrogates", "prometheus", "abraham_lincoln_vampire_hunter", "the_girl_with_all_the_gifts", "mortal_engines"]}
