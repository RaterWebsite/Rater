Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo are great and their chemistry with one another feels authentic. Hailee Steinfeld is also good in a supporting role here.

The characters are well put together, the story is told well, and as I just said, the overall experience is a feel good one. Nothing really overly unique and great about the film as a whole, but it works for what it is. However, the one area where the film is phenomenal is in its music. The songs in the film are magical and really click every single time.

Although her role requires singing, this is obviously not her professional forte. Nevertheless she handles the role nicely. Alas, that\u2019s where the accolades for the film end for the performances of Mark Ruffalo (who always seems to play the same part) and the other performers are hampered by an average script and music that two generations after mine probably love but this writer could do without. Writing and directing the same film is an art and a task not easily carried off.

Refreshingly, in some respects, they didn't, although the potential was there in several scenes.\r The music to the film was probably the most engaging set of songs that I have heard in years. Did Keira do her own singing? Loved hearing Stevie Wonder's 'For Once in My Life' again, so appropriately done. The envisioning of musical accompaniement to Keira's first solo song was almost magical.\r Strangely, Adam Levine of Maroon 5 acquitted himself exceptionally well as I was prepared to dislike him for all the media hype.

The soundtrack is filled with pleasant poppy songs, none of which are memorable. Ruffalo is interesting as always and Knightley may be the most charming she's ever been. Adam Levine co-stars as her ex and does fine as an actor (of course, he sings).

See it if you like music at all...I will probably buy this soundtrack just due to how great the music sounds. The acting was okay, I think Knightley stole the show though, Ruffalo playing second fiddle, and his \"character daughter\" even upstaging him at times. Is it just me or does Ruffalo seem like a type-cast at this point? I mean \"Thanks for Sharing\" and \"Begin Again\" seem like the same guy - disheveled, broken, and generally out-of-sorts.

With its gentle charm and simple, but not simplistic storyline it captivatingly draws one into its wish fulfilment, fantasy romance.

Mark Ruffalo is outstanding here and there is real chemistry between him and Keira Knightley, sporting a very acceptable singing voice. Supporting actors also contribute to the charm, although a little of James Cordon does go a long way. Unfamiliar New York locations are also refreshingly used.\rPersonally I enjoyed it more than John Carney's previous hit, 'Once', and it does share that film's love of music and the endurance of the human spirit.

Maybe yes to a large degree this is due to the fact I sensed very quickly that the bench mark of ONCE would not be found or close to being found by this outing.\r Unfortunately I gave such little attention/interest to the characters in this film I am unable to provide a more detailed review of the actual film itself.\r Carney can do and must do much better than this mild sell out of a production.

Her voice is average, and I couldn't get behind any of the songs.  It's a problem.  And the chemistry between Knightly and Ruffalo is just strange.

Fortunately, the chemistry between the two is there but not exploited in the usual Hollywood fashion.  Whether the music is good, bad, or indifferent will depend on the viewer's background and age.  One wonders, as in so many movies, how the directors and writers of movies from the 1930s to the mid-1960s were able to produce often excellent movies without use of the f word and variants, which trips off the tongues of  the main characters like water dripping from a leaky faucet."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Pretty formulaic.

Ruffalo, a down-on-his-luck music producer, hears Knightley's low-key and poorly received singing in a bar. Then it shows him imagining all the elements that could make the song a hit -- mentally adding in piano, drums, strings, backing vocals.

A good film should be unpredictable and leave you with no clue on what is to happen next.  It is also very \"Cliche\". You will find very little here that has not already been done in many other films. These two points are big ones that take away from the whole movie. The comedy also was not that great. I feel like there was no in between. Either the jokes were hilarious or they flat lined. As the movie went on the jokes became less funny.  The beginning of the movie showed quite a lot of potential. All the comedy was nice, the plot looked like it would go in another direction, and it looked enjoyable. You don't really care for the characters at all because you have seen it all before. None of this is terrible...... It is just mediocre. 4/10\r Characters and Actors: Zach Braff play's Aidan Bloom and he does a pretty good job. His performance was the best part of this film. There isn't really any chemistry between any of the characters. All the characters are just there. Kate Hudson plays his wife Sarah, Josh Gad play's his brother Noah, and Mandy Patinkin plays his father.

There is such a strong cast in this movie. Mark Ruffalo shows off some talent that I had never seen from him before.

Begin Again, while good in its own right, does not measure up to Once. It's a charming movie, with complex characters and a non-edginess that is refreshing, but part of the charm of Once was the anonymity of the cast, the lack of preconceptions made the movie more enjoyable: I was distracted, thinking about the fact that that was Keira Knightly, singing better then I thought she could: Was she being dubbed? And was Adam Levine just playing himself? All this was distracting me from fully enjoying the movie, which is too bad because it is a good film.\rAnother comparison with Once: A plot point in Begin Again is authenticity vs. selling out.

What else can we ask ?\r An amazing musical coming age film well directed by John Carney an amazing director.

Also he character Gretta is really likable and really helps develop Mark Ruffalo's character Dan. The second thing is Mark Ruffalo performance making one of his best performance in my opinion dealing with problems and actually growing and developing his character through the movie.   Finally Adam Levine known from the popular band Maroon 5 making he's debut as an actor making in a great way by adapting to the environment and to his characters situations really good, plus he is great singing.\r The third thing is that this movie is brilliantly written by John Carney using time in a brilliant way to tell his story in amazing way. This script is really good since the characters due change through the movie, also the songs are really amazing and likable.  Although the movie is cheesy sometimes the script is good in general since Carney uses time, well and his characters are really likable.\r In general this is a great age coming film, that should be taken more seriously by critics since a 62 is not what it should have in my opinion.  It is really sad that this movie will not be considered by the Academy Awards (Oscars) for a prize since this movie   is totally a great summer blast and a great musical age coming film that will definitely make you buy the soundtrack of this movie.

It features themes including showbusiness, singing, recording and female musicians. First off, I quite enjoyed Kiera Knightley's singing (which is mostly pop/folk type songs) and I liked that she, as the lead female character, was quite independent, fiesty and self assured, hence she's clearly more on the up than the male lead, Dan (played by Mark Ruffalo). I felt it was quite refreshing to see a film depicting a woman being more in the driving seat, if you know what I mean. It could easily be classified as a chick flick type of film I suppose, with Kiera's character, Gretta, being sassy and so on but it didn't strike me as quite as pure saccarine sweet as some rom com's I've come across. I don't tend to watch many of those.I liked that the singer Adam Levine appeared in it - he's well known for being in the US group Maroon 5, so it does add a certain element of realism to it. I'm not sure I'd agree that fellow co-star James Corden (who plays Steve) is quite as good when it comes to singing or performing as a musician however(!). Joking aside, other cast members include Hailee Steinfeld, who plays Violet, Yasiin Bey as Saul and Catherine Keener as Miriam.The music featured is predominantly quite light in tone, acoustic/unplugged, pretty pleasant, if a little 'airy fairy' but I quite enjoyed it. I suppose it helps to be in a good mood when watching this, as if your in a bad mood then you may feel more likely to roll your eyes and switch it off possibly. It probably didn't quite contain the substance I may have hoped for in such a film categorised as a drama and by that I mean it wasn't exactly a fast paced thriller of a film. The characters are fairly interesting/intriguing and I liked Gretta well enough but the main plot wasn't exactly amazing. Its a pretty light and I guess easy watch.Content wise, the film contains sex references and strong language including some offensive instances of name calling and some pejorative references to different groups of people (teenagers/singers etc.). There are drug references and characters shown who are drunk but otherwise there isn't anything much likely to offend to upset. The film has been given a 15 rating in the UK.Its fair to say that this is a film which is optimistic in tone, which is somewhat summery and may be an enjoyable watch, particularly if your keen on dramas which focus on character development, films with strong female lead roles and you like contemporary folk music perhaps. It isn't in any way a memorable film - I can't see myself thinking back to it in the future at all but it isn't as bad as it perhaps could have been. To me it was relatively good but, I suppose, probably more average or alright over all, as for my personal tastes it seemed to lack a real depth or substance, so I'll err on the side of caution somewhat and go for an overall 5 out of 10 rating for this one.I suppose I would cautiously recommend this film. It features decent performances from Knightley and Ruffalo and has some fun music - the plot pace is a little slow and it isn't especially dramatic as such but itd alright. Its a fairly easy watch and it isn't as cringey as some 'chick flicks' I've seen, so it could be worse. However, it won't suit everyone - if your looking for a really dramatic film, or a film featuring a speedy plot pace, or if you hate cheese then this won't be for you and I didn't feel it was very memorable either. It has good points and bad points, so I suppose I'd leave it up to the individual to decide if they'd enjoy it or not - I'd, personally, hoped for a bit more substance but thats a personal preference."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Relationship to being true: Not true.Description: A story about a woman living in New York who comes into conflict when her boyfriend is unfaithful to her.

Not bad for before breakfast.As verdict, then, and sorry to be like that, the Gregg Alexander songs, knocking round in head a week later, were just a tad drear- sorry, Gregg.Costume: some very nice clothes, and... no jarring notes.Tech: probably brilliant, and must have had to bite tongue? as plot suggests it is freedom of human spirit, to want to record an album in the open air.Script: The conversation flowed, I'd say.Does it use beautiful people to get your attention? The answer is yes- but I found them endearing people. Good for structure- about 90 mins, and 3 acts.Acting: everyone? seems quite relaxed.Further questions.1) Jove the philanderer, actually has a record deal and a film and does what people \"want\". Juno releases her album for free but has spirit. Which sensibility made this film, Begin Again, though, do you think?2) I'm not sure why I was crying, at the rooftop scene.3) I liked the film. However, if I am being safe, then I suspect New York and music is not so wholesome. Thank you."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Begin Again is a rare movie that have a perfect big decision in every single one of them, they have a perfect decision to not do this and they have a perfect decision to do this, and that is hard to do, it's subjective like the movie itself but for me it's just perfect, Begin Again is not just a typical street road music performer movie, John Carney give every single heart of his to the movie that surprisingly didn't take a long time and it surely give the movie more positive things, he can just not put or do that but he did and it's amazing, it's just one little thing but somehow it's like a guarantee for me especially to enjoy and liking the whole movie, and i did, i like every single second, decision, song, and act performance in this movie, Begin Again is a movie that it's not gonna go in any greatest movie list or whatever, but it's still hell of a priceless movie."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "The film has heart and the chemistry between Kiera Knightly and Mark Ruffalo is nice, but the experience one gets from watching the film is the equivalent to being on tour with an uninspired, lazy tour guide. I'm talking about that one guide who doesn't care if they get fired soon. The one who will show off the locations and attractions, but they want to get the tour done and over with as quickly as possible."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "fine movie with a really good acting and actors and an absolutely awful ending , its like the screenwriter has died at the middle of film and they just wanted to prolong it with music and then it got out of their control and they found their selves without an ending then decided to show us some part of it after the actual ending at the credits , watch it if you are bored or you are music lover but i think its not a good movie and you cant enjoy it very much if you watch it for being a good movie , just watch it as an amusing movie...."}], "recommendations": ["yesterday", "mamma_mia_here_we_go_again", "bohemian_rhapsody", "burlesque", "into_the_woods", "a_star_is_born", "the_greatest_showman", "in_the_heights", "almost_famous", "crazy_heart", "the_sound_of_music", "cats", "rocketman", "whiplash", "hairspray", "chicago", "sweeney_todd_the_demon_barber_of_fleet_street", "we_are_your_friends", "jingle_jangle_a_christmas_journey", "annette", "eddie_the_eagle", "mary_poppins_returns", "moulin_rouge", "american_hustle", "magnolia"]}
