Nothing but spastic, close-up, 2-second shots from a bunch of random-ass perspectives, in order to create a manufactured sense of frenetic energy (which end up coming off as totally flimsy and cheap). I couldn't stop comparing this spastic piece of crap to the original (brilliant) \"Dawn of the Dead\" as I watched it, and yearning for just ONE damn scene with a sense of pacing, and gloom, and contemplation. This movie is completely tone-deaf and confused as far as the genre it's going for.  I absolutely hate movies like this. No contemplation. No wide shots. No subtly. The **** camera NEVER stops shifting around and shaking up and down and side to side. It's like what a zombie movie would look like if directed by Michael Bay; but even Michael Bay probably would have done a better job than this.

By now we have seen them basically every way and everywhere- that's not true. Back then when they started as a witty and witchy horror spectacle to when they were boiled to a mindless harrowing personality to just simply being mindless. Somehow as time travelled, the numerosity became their identity and the only strength they posses. While this is of course not the reality- in a comic con language obviously- there are few spins that has tested well among the audience. Comic being the major one. And then comes this Marc Foster project or more like Brad Pitt project that takes it seriously.For they have a source, Marx Brooks whose book the film is novelizing has managed to come up with a solution that is not a headshot or a parody. And as far as that \"novelization\" genre is concerned the film aces on all levels. The character gets enough room to spread their legs and walk as slow and act as they wish to. And that is the only section where this summer blockbuster is different from any other punching bag game show.And what's medicinal to the film is the concept itself. What they were endorsing about. Very few times do we get a product that gets the identifying quality of it on the spot. And for that scene- you'll know which one am I talking about- this war is worth it. Speaking of it, the title is almost too perfectly titled. The zombies were never previously shown so passionately. Their aggression is their hobby and not something that they are slave of.

I grew up on George A. Romero's zombie movies, the ones with sluggish undead people craving for human \"braaainz!\". I realize of course that that type of monsters are too slow for our modern movie munching society but consider this, if the British were managed to make a fast paced zombie movie with great action scenes and compelling story from a marginally smaller budget (28 Days Later), then why could not the Americans achieve the same?\rThe protagonist  the average male figure who is just looking out for his loved ones  is common enough in these movies (and video games of the genre), but this movie failed to utilize him the way it meant to be. We got Brad Pitt loosened on a wild goose chase across continents and countries achieving virtually nothing, and without skills relying on sheer luck to survive and magically save the whole world at the end.\rThe story was not engaging and the climax came too late to stimulate my attention, although it would have been great for a family drama, but clearly not for a thriller/horror show.\rMy verdict is that this movie is a one time popcorn movie which did not deserve the \u00a313 fee I had to spend on it."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "BRAD PITT COLLECTS ANOTHER PAYCHECK ....and audiences continue to get dumbed down into paying for lazy trash like wwz\r don't expect to be horrified, expect to be bored and annoyed"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I want to start by saying that overall I enjoyed the movie and thought it was pretty decent.

Secondly, the first half of the film was extremely good especially as things in the world were going to hell. But it seemed to fall apart a little when Pitt started just flying all over the world. Finally, I think the movie suffers from a lack of identity because it wasn't really a thriller or horror and it seemed to try to do a little of both to no real success.

What brings that down is that the story is basically focused on the zombies, they don't utilize a great actor, the story is frankly dumb sometimes, and there aren't any characters to delve into. I like Brad Pitt, but for being the lead and the most focused character, there simply isn't much to him or anyone else in the movie. With that in mind there are definitely some enjoyable scenes that are shot very well. I left the theater just not caring about anyone that I saw, there is no human connection to the film other than Gerry (Brad Pitt) and his family.

It was destine to become a movie, especially now, with the popularity of zombies, but ultimately, the highly anticipated film fails to deliver anything different. U.N. Employee, Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt), is out with his family when a recently discovered virus hits the United States and all hell breaks loose. The first 45 minutes of this film were literally like the pilot of The Walking Dead. No one knows what's going on, people are panicking, it was all very predictable. The film does go into a different direction after that, but how many different ways of doing a zombie film are there? Lane starts traveling the world seeking a cure for the disease, while at the same time trying to avoid being attacked. The unfortunate fact is that no matter how good the acting or the writing, there is very little you can actually do with a zombie film. The zombies and the circumstances behind the outbreak are always a little different, but ultimately it becomes about survival or the race to find a cure. Brad Pitt is terrific, and as I have been saying for year, it doesn't matter how good looking the guy is, he belongs in action films! This is the genre where he excels and even though World War Z was painfully predictable, Pitt makes it worth watching. He is the focus of the story and it takes a lot of quick thinking and tremendous stunts to keep him alive. For me that was the best part of the film. There was a lot of hype behind World War Z and it was a very intense film, but like I said, there is very little you can do with an end of the world/zombie film that hasn't been done over and over again.

Brad goes off on a mission to save the world and he does a good job, the zombies are both scary as hell but gore-free more or less and weirdly 'family friendly' as they both race around and shuffle and jerk in the time-honoured zombie style.

That being said, if you've read the book beforehand, the trailers alone should let you know that the film is going in wholly different direction that Max Brooks laid out in his novel.\r I am a huge fan of the zombie franchise, which George Romero essentially put a patent on and dozens of films have branched off from over the years. What \"World War Z\" does is attempt to mesh the behavioral patterns of the \"28 Days Later\" infected undead (I refuse to call them zombies, zombies are the slow, shuffling Romero staple) with the essential ideas behind Brooks' book. It does this admirably, but it's a direction that ultimately didn't need to be taken in order to make the film successful. In my mind, it felt like a lazy way of telling a story that builds itself up, cutting time off of the reel in favor of a more fast-paced, energized film experience.\r Being a huge fan of the book, I refused to shell out the $10 to see it in the theaters; as I said, the trailers told me clearly that the film was going to diverge far enough from the book for me to lower my expectations. As a rental, and for what it is, it's nowhere near terrible. Remove all comparisons to the book it takes minor inspirations from, and Brad Pitt does a solid job of weaving his way through a decently scripted and constructed horror film.\r This ended up being Pitt's highest grossing film to date, and a combination of factors play into that, not least of which being a rather stale list of opposing options in theaters at the time of its release.

It's as though not a single person who worked on the film read even the synopsis of the book. I suppose if I could get past that, I may have been able to see some entertaining value here.

I mean sure there are zombies and the world as we know it ends, but when the whole movie theatre laughs when a zombie gets a close up, it kills the essence of the theme. The movie attempts to be character driven but the acting and plot are just plain weak. On top of that, the story literally gets no where. Every new scene seems to be completely disconnected from the previous. I honestly cant think of a moment in the movie that awed me in any way. The positives to this movie are so minuscule. There really are no similar movies to compare this to, but if you have seen the show, The Walking Dead, the quality of screen play and emotions provoked from a zombie apocalypse do not even come close. 3 seems like it may be a rough score but as a fan boy, this movie was a true let down."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Simple and typical may be what I may describe this movie.

I'm sure that the movie has some intellectual or subliminal message hidden in and around the movie, or whatever message the writers want to convey.

If you like gore, putrefy zombies and fear, there is none of this, but this movie have other qualities.\r The plot: this time it's not some young collegians trying to escape the building in the middle of a party, it's a worldwide pandemic of zombies that collapse most of governments, had already destroy half of mankind and threaten the rest. So the UN investigator Gerry Lane and best dad of the world must travel around the world to find a way to stop the ``virus``, alongside some allies, the most interesting being Segen, the short-haired woman soldier. the first two acts are of the same qualities: good to great.

Go get the AMC series Walking Dead and you will find more character depth, action, and suspense in one 40 minute episode."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "World War Z is a film that has so much potential but 'decided' to become simply a film targeted at the teenage 'Resident Evil' crowd. Absolutely great set pieces are framed by a narrative that is too simple, disregarding the heavy morality prevalent in brilliant series 'The Walking Dead' in favor of large scale action. Sure these set pieces are pulse pounding and brilliant, Pitt still the always great leading man and all, but hey... where are all the nuances that made the original novel a masterpiece? Nevertheless, a very watchable film but just leave 'your brain' at the front door of the theater ;p"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "I was simply blown away with how amazing this film really was. It's safe to say it's up there as one of the best zombie films, but its also one of the more unique zombie movies that has been made as they put a real twist on the genre. Brad Pitt leads the way in a cast of no other real stand-outs as family man Gerry trying to get his loved ones to safety along with working out what started an outbreak. It had minor flaws but they were overshadowed by effective scenery & impressive CGI. Top stuff!"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "First off, I have not read the book, but I get what the general idea of it is. I went into this film with low expectations, with Brad Pitt being the main draw for me, but this film was fantastic! It more than exceeded my expectations and features an unusually smart script, a great performance by Brad Pitt, and surprisingly scary and intense sequences. But the biggest shocker of the film is that the PG-13 rating actually works! It forced the filmmakers to be more creative and focus on actual tension and horror, rather than a zombie in the dark chewing on a human arm. The characters in the movie actually call them \"zombies\" unlike every other zombie film where people say \"walkers\" or something along those lines. Overall, a really fun, scary, and smart film that constantly surprises you and, while it doesn't re-define the genre, it effectively freshens up the zombie film genre."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Good summer movie. They should of made it R rated. CGI could of been better. Script needed more work. But with all that said, it will entertain you. The ending wasn't as bad as some made it out to be, just to abrupt."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "With a world-sweeping plot reminiscent of Steven Soderberg\u2019s Contagion, an intense, kinetic pace tastefully interspersed with snappy dialogue, and a leading man, in Brad Pitt, up to the task of anchoring it all in the realm of suspended disbelief, World War Z may very well be the best modern zombie film yet to grace cinemas.\r To say it was an arduous task to deliver the movie might be this year\u2019s movie-related understatement, and there have been  and there still remain  many doubts as to whether or not it would all be worthwhile.\r Based on the novel, World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War, penned by Max Brooks, the son of comedy filmmaking legend Mel Brooks and actress Ann Bancroft, the movie\u2019s script went through several difficult and drastic alterations before filming wrapped in October of last year. Initially adapted in 2008 by sci-fi and comic book scribe J. Michael Straczynski, the screenplay went through a complete overhaul by Matthew Michael Carnahan, whose debut film, The Kingdom, delivered the kind of politically-infused action Paramount Studios and Pitt\u2019s production company, Plan B, were looking for.\r For the rest of the review, please visit:\rhttp://tuffgnarl.com/world-war-z-review/"}], "recommendations": ["maze_runner_the_scorch_trials", "i_am_legend", "daybreakers", "chernobyl_diaries", "army_of_the_dead", "riddick", "underworld_blood_wars", "pandorum", "the_girl_with_all_the_gifts", "the_tomorrow_war", "28_days_later", "bird_box", "the_last_witch_hunter", "the_purge_election_year", "the_mist", "the_maze_runner", "the_book_of_eli", "monsters", "priest", "the_cloverfield_paradox", "surrogates", "independence_day_resurgence", "poseidon", "abraham_lincoln_vampire_hunter", "underworld_awakening"]}
