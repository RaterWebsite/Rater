Wes Craven just took the limits and broke it in half with no remorse! Scream is the normal run-of-the-mill slasher at first glance, but is it really? Not really. While yes, Scream IS about the final girl being chased by the creepy masked guy trope we\u2019ve all seen throughout the years, but scream takes on a more meta approach and adds more humor along the way. This movie predicts itself in a lot of places, but stills add a bunch of new and creative ideas, such as the kills.\tThe kills and the scares are one reason to watch this movie, and it's a good reason too. The kills are AMAZING in this movie. Their creative, gory, gut-wrenching, but most importantly, scary. The movie captivates you with the mystery of who the killer is and what they plan to do next to our protagonists, which are also a good reason to watch this movie. The characters are not bad at all, they\u2019re fun to watch them do their thing and see how they react to their upcoming demise, which sounds dark but hey, it's just a movie.\tIt Overall Scream was an instant classic and scared many when it first came out and still scares people today. I even found myself on the edge of my seat while watching. While it's good scares, great actors, good scares, great kills, amazing killer persona (Ghostface), and what matters most, a damn good twist.

I'm sure not everyone understands the refrences but if you really think about some of the lines that they say, they are hilarious. For example, when \"Sydney\" is talking about who would play her in a movie, she said, \" Thanks Dewey, but with my luck they would cast Tori Spelling...\" Which in Scream 2, the movie that they \"made\" of \"her life\" was called \"Stab\" and her character was played by none other than, Tori Spelling... Then when \"Principle Himbrey\" was looking around the office trying to figure out who was knocking on his door, he startled the janitor...who was in a red and green sweater and he called the janitor, \"Fred\" as in \"Freddy Kruger\".  Wes Craven directed \"A Nightmare on Elm Street.Then \"Tatum\" tells \"Sydney\"  that everything that is going on is like a Wes Carpenter flick, which is a combination of Wes Craven, the director of \"Scream\" and John Carpenter the director of \"Halloween\". I also love the part when Jamie Kennedy who plays \"Randy\" is watching \"Halloween\" and telling Jamie Lee Curtis to look behind her because the killer was there, while the killer in \"Scream\" , \"Ghostface\", is actually sneaking up behind him, at the same time. Basically, I think everyone should watch this movie because I think it is fantastic!! :)"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "An excellent film.

I wholeheartedly believe hat SCREAM  is better than HORROR CLASSICS SUCH AS A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, THE SHINING, PSYCHO, and even it's biggest inspiration HALLOWEEN! The acting is phenomenal, and when you have actors/actresses such as, NEVE CAMPBELL, DREW BARRYMORE, SKEET ULRICH, MATHEW LILLARD, and ROSE MCGOWEN, you have a good movie there. The people who say that this film is just a generic teen slasher flick obviously haven't seen the movie. This movie is so much more and is very high on story, emotion, and once you see this movie, you just can't stop. Its like a vacuum that just keeps sucking you in, there is not one dragging, slow or boring moment in the film for it is truly a masterpiece. Even if there is a moment where the killer isn't there and no action is occurring you're just so entertained by the unbelievable dialogue! Many consider it overrated, but I view it as the complete opposite, this film is overlooked, and misunderstood by many. This is one of those films that you could watch twenty times in a row and still enjoy it, he'll about a year ago I spent about two weeks watching the whole franchise multiple times. This is not a movie that deserves any negative reviews and almost seventeen years after its release SCREAM IS TRULY A CLASSIC! IT IS A PERFECT MOVIE 10/10! You can't go wrong with this film (which by the way is my SECOND FAVORITE FILM OF ALL TIME behind no other than a certain Spielburg classic.) SCREAM IS ABSOLUTE PERFECTION AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT SHALL NEVER CHANGE!"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "I saw this film for the first time on Halloween night right after I finished watching Halloween(original) for the first time. Also I saw Nightmare on Elm Street before I watched this movie as well. This is how this movie is intended to be viewed: after NOES and Halloween. THIS IS KEY PEOPLE!!! you MUST see A Nightmare on Elm Street, Psycho, AND Halloween to get the full effect for this one. Friday the 13th and The Silence of the Lambs don't hurt either. If you do not you can never appreciate this movie fully. There are so many little things in this one that you will pick up that make your enjoyment of this film more complete.All that to say, this film is a very smart and witty comedy/horror film that is as funny as it is suspenseful. you never really know where it is going to go next. I'm not sure what I can say without giving away plot, but I'll do my best. This film is an addition, a parody, and an homage to the Slasher genre. it pulls it off beautifully. it perfects the genre if you will. It...it's very tongue-in-cheek. it is sort of difficult to explain the relationship this film has to the rest of the major slashers. you just have to see it for yourself (READ THE FIRST PARAGRAPH).One of the major reasons I like this film, is that everyone in this film is HUMAN. In other slasher films, people aren't as human. As characters, you can't relate to them. take Halloween (the first one) for example, Laurie is just a character. you get no backstory from her at all (as far as I remember). she's just a random girl who some killer stalks (keep it in the perspective of the first one). and don't even get me started on her friends. all I can say is: knife fodder. with Scream, all characters are easy to relate to. what I mean is, they are clearly human characters, which brings me to my NEXT point: THE KILLER!!!The Killer. aaah yes, the killer. Ghostface. let me start of by saying this, in any other slasher film, we'll pick on Friday the 13th this time, it goes like this: Jason could be sitting on the couch flipping channels for 90 minutes doing NOTHING and still make his kill quota for the movie. How? because the characters in his movie are so dumb this is how it would go: Jason would be sitting there and dumb chick #1 would come up to him screaming the \"the killer is chasing me\" scream. he wouldn't react and so she would take his machete and stab herself still screaming. it would continue like this until Final Girl would bonk him on ht head and he would get up, stretch, and go off to hibernate until the next sequel. It is just that easy for the average slasher film serial killer to kill his victims. you don't believe me? watch some of them. not Ghostface though. ohohoho no not Ghostface. no Ghostface EARNS his kills. I can't tell you what I mean though. you have to see it. this proves though, that under the awesome costume, Ghostface is just an ordinary person with ordinary strengths and skills. It makes the film a lot more believable. none of this \"Arnie in his prime hit me over the head with a 100 megaton Hydrogen Bomb that went on to explode sending the sun crashing on me and I picked myself up brushed myself off and went on my way\" crap. You get bored of an unkillable killer after a short time.well, I've written out my confusing rant long enough. I hope you enjoy reading it. this film isn't perfect but I would highly suggest this one. it is certainly my favorite slasher film and it also comes with the bonus feature of a rare (I actually think one of a kind) good sequel. but, I must leave you with one final piece of advice: pay attention to the DIALOGUE. well, yeah. I've ranted long enough. (although if you want, for the people who have seen Scream, I can make a blog about all of the little...well, extra bits of this movie. trivia relations stuff like that. let me know if you want me to). but yeah. it was a great film."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "One of the best horror movies of all time.

There were several actors who became Hollywood mainstays after the release of Scream.

Made for $15 million and opening with only a little over $6 million it looked like a flop. But as the weeks went on and word of mouth spread and critics started seeing it. The reviews shot up and so did the box office. Ultimately making over $173 million worldwide. I'm happy to say that I got to experience the phenomenon first hand working at a movie theater. To this day the movie is still fantastic. It's truly a perfect storm from the fluid, accomplished direction from Wes Craven to the brilliant screenplay by My personal idol Kevin Williamson and a perfectly cast of actors giving inspired performances. Neve Campbell was without a doubt one of the strongest scream queens to grace our genre and of course we can't forget the charasmatic Courtney Cox or lovably dopey David Arquette that followed her through the excellent franchise. And of course memorable work by Rose McGowan, Matthew Lillard, Jamie Kennedy, Skeet Ulrich and more. Of course no one can forget the amazing cameo by Drew Barrymore.

That's what this movie is. Not only it's a modern day classic, it's almost a perfect film. It serves as a slasher flick, a perfect blend of slasher and whodunit, an excellent thriller and an extremely exciting rollercoaster ride. In my opinion, Scream and Scream 2 are better than his most popular movie, A Nightmare on Elm Street. No, I don't hate original Freddy movie, I consider it to be one of the bests of the genre. But I find Scream way beyond that. It might possibly be because I am more into thrillers, murder mysteries and whodunits, but that doesn't change the fact that I find Scream to be Wes Craven's greatest work.There are a lot of goods I have say about this movie, and I won't be spoiling anything. All these stuffs aren't probably things that have not been already said prior to my review. But these are the reasons why I love it so much. First, it's extremely well-paced. It has a definitive tone it goes for, any doesn't miss a bit at all. It is almost two hours long, it begins to end at around 1:30:00 mark. The last 30 minutes doesn't even feel like 30 minutes. It's almost like 5 or 6 minutes, and I am not even exaggerating. There's not a single moment in the movie which doesn't give an uneasy feeling. That uneasy feeling lasts throughout the movie, until things start getting revealed. And after that, what follows is an intense, action packed finale that the movie absolutely deserves. And I almost forgot. The opening of this movie is perhaps the best opening of all the slasher films since the late 70s. ..Even if it wasn't a meta film, except for a few interesting pop culture references, it would've worked equally well. That's because it has a story of it's own. You are constantly gripped by the whodunit aspect of the movie. It completely understands that it's actually the intensity, the tension and the characterizations you give in the film that makes it work, not some pointless gory scenes. Thegore and kills are mere aftermath and payoff of what we had just witnessed in the story. Gore doesn't equal a great horror, and in particular, a great slasher. Seems like this film understood it really well. And there's something that this movie does, which none of the slashers before it and (except for a little extent in Scream 2) none of its sequels do. That is getting the uncertainty factor absolutely right. Definitely, I would say none of the endings of the Scream movies (1 to 4, at the time of this review) were quite predictable to me. But, even in the beloved classics, except for a possible few dodges, we get to know who the main lead is and who's going to be the victim. It's not that with Scream. At many moments, even though we recognize the main lead (who's awesome, btw) we feel like she might not make it. And, definitely a lot of people are sliced. But, we do not, or should I say, cannot expect a character to die or not to die because it plays the trope of \"everyone is a suspect\" extremely well. ..This movie has the best batch of characters in any slasher movie. All the characters are so memorable and the characterizations are brilliant. You cannot exchange one character with the other. There are no stock characters for extra kills or something like that. Every kill happens for a purpose, may it have a motive or may it be an act of a pure psychopath. And in that line, I would also like to mention that Neve Campbell is my most favorite actress (and Sidney Prescott is my favorite slasher lead character) when it comes to the ones who've been the lead of a slasher movie. Unlike a lot of such leads, she doesn't feel like a \"typically written to survive\" lead. She has more depth to her character than many of the leads from many different franchises combined! She does a lot of stuff that kinda reminds me of John McClane. She definitely does whole lot less of over the top things that McClane does, but she does have some great one liners, fantastic fight/action scenes and the vulnerability that makes us feel that she's one of us, and not a movie character. That being said, the performances are extremely great. Neve Campbell as Sidney Prescott, Courtney Cox as Gale Weathers, David Arquette as Dewey, Shaggy (Matthew Lillard) as Stu, and Skeet Ulrich as Billy Loomis and all the others have given a fantastic performance. ..It's a movie which doesn't use its meta nature as an excuse for being lame, in fact, it's everything but lame. Being a meta movie, it serves as a celebration of almost two decades of slasher films by taking jabs on cliches while using that cliche in a much more grounded way. It gives a well written story and a whole bunch of well written characters and an intensely exciting storytelling. That's what makes it so great. If you haven't checked it out, don't waste any time. Please, see this movie. It's a highly underappreciated (though insanely popular) and a criminally underrated gem of a movie. ..Rating : absolute 10/10; golden A+"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "scream is one of my favorite slasher movies of all time. i would recommend it for any thriller lover. i love the ironic and sattiracal humour throughout the film's run time and all the quirky characters. even the villians are likable and cool. overall it's not a very scary film, but it's not exactly meant to be. it's a fun movie for teens and slasher lovers and one of my favorite movies."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "The film was released in December, five days before Christmas.
