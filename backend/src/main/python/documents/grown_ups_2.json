The bar has been set so low for this franchise that I am actually scared to see even trailers for the inevitable third film. Mark my words; Grown Ups 2 is so insufferably awful it will win Razzie awards. Good luck searching for a worse comedy in 2013."

This movie is one of the worst films I have ever seen in the past decade. There is no plot/story whatsoever, a bunch of pee/poop/ass jokes that even kids can't laugh at, and terrible acting by nearly the entire cast. This film is so bad it should not be considered a movie, but a f****d up, very bad sitcom from the 90s that never hit tvs. Never see this movie in your life."

Sandler, who earned $37m in 2012, releases yet another unfunny and offensive film on the public. That he genuinely thinks his films have worth reveals more about Sandler's state of mind than the state of the industry. Eventually the rest of Hollywood will see the light. Terrible."

This is what you get when Adam Sandler makes a movie a piece of garbage that is not worth 12 dollars to go see I mean I felt like they should have at least bring down the price a couple of bucks because I felt like I wasted a night of my life. Now I will say this though some parts will make you laugh but it's not enough to take your mind off the stupidness of this movie. I have to say this though I felt this movie had potential a lot to because it has such a funny trailer but when you watch this you fell like you watched a lie. So I would give it a little less if I didn't  laugh at something's but this is a movie that you rent and watch with your friends because I rather get it a redbox for 1 dollar than pay 12 for this garbage."

The movie has no story to speak of and the plot was forgotten in a haze of bad bodily function jokes and Nick Swardson once again trying way to hard to be funny and failing at every turn.  The film sets up dozens of potential plotlines but most are forgotten about or quickly thrown back in to try and recover by giving it a poorly constructed resolution.  To top it off, the jokes in the film are so painfully bad that it should come with a warning that expecting mothers should avoid the film and how it will destroy your ability to ever find joy in this world again.  The worse part, Adam Sandler will make sure to be a part of something even worse in 2014."

      "text": "Okay, so because this movie is a sequel and we all know how sequel's generally only exist due to the production team wanting to cash in on the success of the first movie, this review is based on this movie living up to the same standard of it's predecessor. Grown Ups (The first one) was quite a heart-warming film, about a group of childhood friends reuniting to bid their Basketball couch farewell, who seemed to have given all of them a sense of purpose and drive to continue their lives into adulthood. The second film, has none of the first movie's seemingly moral stature. There doesn't seem to be any apparent plot, and it merely follows the group of friends around their everyday existence in their neighborhood. There were a few minor chuckles here and there, but with the amount of lame, \"teenage\" toilet humor jokes, it's clear that the only reason this movie had a theatrical release was because of the cast, and I suppose also because they expected the same crowds that flocked to the first installment. This movie was a disappointment, and not worth paying money to watch at the cinema. Wait for dvd, even better, wait till your local broadcaster airs it, because technically it's a bit embarrassing people would contribute to a million plus in box office sales, as it certainly isn't worth it."

James is himself as usual (which isn't a compliment) I preferred him in 'King Of Queens' and Rock doesn't unleash his full potential.

Everyone from the first film (and then some) are back for more wacky adventures, delivering what you Grown Ups fans would expect. Beyond the film's exterior, you can see that the children are getting older and the main characters are trying to accept that, but it's just shrouded in crazy jokes. In most parts of the film, vomiting, homosexual undertones and male butts are the butt of the jokes, so it's not for everyone, but I'm pretty sure that teens would love it. Although there are way better comedies out there, this is a guilty pleasure of mine. The film's very colorful and filled with life and it's fun to watch once in a while. But all in all, it depends on the type of person you are. So if you liked the first one, I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy this. Not much has changed."

Many people complain because they think Grown Ups 2 has no plot, but the plot is Lenny and the crews life. The overall theme in this movie is family life, unrealistic family life, but still family life. You can't walk into a Adam Sandler movie believing your going to see a high powered dramatic movie.
