Sure there were moments of disbelief, but its not that big of a deal. Just turn off the brain and stop trying to over analyze the movie to death with prison camps and slavery references. The animation was fine, the ending was upbeat, the cast of characters was respectably interesting, and the acting was fine. A solid 6."

You have to be bred for that.\r\rRight.\r\rLook. That's more pollen\rthan you and I will see in a lifetime.\r\rIt's just a status symbol.\rBees make too much of it.\r\rPerhaps. Unless you're wearing it\rand the ladies see you wearing it.\r\rThose ladies?\rAren't they our cousins too?\r\rDistant.

It's fine.\rI know I'm dreaming.\r\rBut I don't recall going to bed.\r\rWell, I'm sure this\ris very disconcerting.\r\rThis is a bit of a surprise to me.\rI mean, you're a bee!\r\rI am. And I'm not supposed\rto be doing this,\r\rbut they were all trying to kill me.\r\rAnd if it wasn't for you...\r\rI had to thank you.\rIt's just how I was raised.\r\rThat was a little weird.\r\r- I'm talking with a bee.\r- Yeah.\r\rI'm talking to a bee.\rAnd the bee is talking to me!\r\rI just want to say I'm grateful.\rI'll leave now.\r\r- Wait! How did you learn to do that?\r- What?\r\rThe talking thing.\r\rSame way you did, I guess.\r\"Mama, Dada, honey.\" You pick it up.\r\r- That's very funny.\r- Yeah.\r\rBees are funny. If we didn't laugh,\rwe'd cry with what we have to deal with.\r\rAnyway...\r\rOan I...\r\r...get you something?\r- Like what?\r\rI don't know. I mean...\rI don't know. Ooffee?\r\rI don't want to put you out.\r\rIt's no trouble.

I don't know.\r\rI want to do my part for the hive,\rbut I can't do it the way they want.\r\rI know how you feel.\r\r- You do?\r- Sure.\r\rMy parents wanted me to be a lawyer or\ra doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.\r\r- Really?\r- My only interest is flowers.\r\rOur new queen was just elected\rwith that same campaign slogan.\r\rAnyway, if you look...\r\rThere's my hive right there. See it?\r\rYou're in Sheep Meadow!\r\rYes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!\r\rNo way! I know that area.\rI lost a toe ring there once.\r\r- Why do girls put rings on their toes?\r- Why not?\r\r- It's like putting a hat on your knee.\r- Maybe I'll try that.\r\r- You all right, ma'am?\r- Oh, yeah. Fine.\r\rJust having two cups of coffee!\r\rAnyway, this has been great.\rThanks for the coffee.\r\rYeah, it's no trouble.\r\rSorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,\rI'd be up the rest of my life.\r\rAre you...?\r\rOan I take a piece of this with me?\r\rSure! Here, have a crumb.\r\r- Thanks!\r- Yeah.\r\rAll right. Well, then...\rI guess I'll see you around.\r\rOr not.\r\rOK, Barry.\r\rAnd thank you\rso much again... for before.\r\rOh, that? That was nothing.\r\rWell, not nothing, but... Anyway...\r\rThis can't possibly work.\r\rHe's all set to go.\rWe may as well try it.\r\rOK, Dave, pull the chute.\r\r- Sounds amazing.\r- It was amazing!\r\rIt was the scariest,\rhappiest moment of my life.\r\rHumans! I can't believe\ryou were with humans!\r\rGiant, scary humans!\rWhat were they like?\r\rHuge and crazy. They talk crazy.\r\rThey eat crazy giant things.\rThey drive crazy.\r\r- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?\r- Some of them. But some of them don't.\r\r- How'd you get back?\r- Poodle.\r\rYou did it, and I'm glad. You saw\rwhatever you wanted to see.\r\rYou had your \"experience.\" Now you\rcan pick out yourjob and be normal.\r\r- Well...\r- Well?\r\rWell, I met someone.\r\rYou did? Was she Bee-ish?\r\r- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!\r- No, no, no, not a wasp.\r\r- Spider?\r- I'm not attracted to spiders.\r\rI know it's the hottest thing,\rwith the eight legs and all.\r\rI can't get by that face.\r\rSo who is she?\r\rShe's... human.\r\rNo, no. That's a bee law.\rYou wouldn't break a bee law.\r\r- Her name's Vanessa.\r- Oh, boy.\r\rShe's so nice. And she's a florist!\r\rOh, no! You're dating a human florist!\r\rWe're not dating.\r\rYou're flying outside the hive, talking\rto humans that attack our homes\r\rwith power washers and M-80s!\rOne-eighth a stick of dynamite!\r\rShe saved my life!\rAnd she understands me.\r\rThis is over!\r\rEat this.\r\rThis is not over! What was that?\r\r- They call it a crumb.\r- It was so stingin' stripey!\r\rAnd that's not what they eat.\rThat's what falls off what they eat!\r\r- You know what a Oinnabon is?\r- No.\r\rIt's bread and cinnamon and frosting.\rThey heat it up...\r\rSit down!\r\r...really hot!\r- Listen to me!\r\rWe are not them! We're us.\rThere's us and there's them!\r\rYes, but who can deny\rthe heart that is yearning?\r\rThere's no yearning.\rStop yearning. Listen to me!\r\rYou have got to start thinking bee,\rmy friend.

I intend to do something.\r\rOh, Barry, stop.\r\rWho told you humans are taking\rour honey? That's a rumor.\r\rDo these look like rumors?\r\rThat's a conspiracy theory.\rThese are obviously doctored photos.\r\rHow did you get mixed up in this?\r\rHe's been talking to humans.\r\r- What?\r- Talking to humans?!\r\rHe has a human girlfriend.\rAnd they make out!\r\rMake out? Barry!\r\rWe do not.\r\r- You wish you could.\r- Whose side are you on?\r\rThe bees!\r\rI dated a cricket once in San Antonio.\rThose crazy legs kept me up all night.\r\rBarry, this is what you want\rto do with your life?\r\rI want to do it for all our lives.\rNobody works harder than bees!\r\rDad, I remember you\rcoming home so overworked\r\ryour hands were still stirring.\rYou couldn't stop.\r\rI remember that.\r\rWhat right do they have to our honey?\r\rWe live on two cups a year.

I can't do this\"?\r\rBees have never been afraid\rto change the world.\r\rWhat about Bee Oolumbus?\rBee Gandhi? Bejesus?\r\rWhere I'm from, we'd never sue humans.\r\rWe were thinking\rof stickball or candy stores.\r\rHow old are you?\r\rThe bee community\ris supporting you in this case,\r\rwhich will be the trial\rof the bee century.\r\rYou know, they have a Larry King\rin the human world too.\r\rIt's a common name. Next week...\r\rHe looks like you and has a show\rand suspenders and colored dots...\r\rNext week...\r\rGlasses, quotes on the bottom from the\rguest even though you just heard 'em.\r\rBear Week next week!\rThey're scary, hairy and here live.\r\rAlways leans forward, pointy shoulders,\rsquinty eyes, very Jewish.\r\rIn tennis, you attack\rat the point of weakness!\r\rIt was my grandmother, Ken.

I try not\rto use the competition.\r\rSo why are you helping me?\r\rBees have good qualities.\r\rAnd it takes my mind off the shop.\r\rInstead of flowers, people\rare giving balloon bouquets now.\r\rThose are great, if you're three.\r\rAnd artificial flowers.\r\r- Oh, those just get me psychotic!\r- Yeah, me too.\r\rBent stingers, pointless pollination.\r\rBees must hate those fake things!\r\rNothing worse\rthan a daffodil that's had work done.\r\rMaybe this could make up\rfor it a little bit.\r\r- This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.\r- I guess.\r\rYou sure you want to go through with it?\r\rAm I sure? When I'm done with\rthe humans, they won't be able\r\rto say, \"Honey, I'm home,\"\rwithout paying a royalty!\r\rIt's an incredible scene\rhere in downtown Manhattan,\r\rwhere the world anxiously waits,\rbecause for the first time in history,\r\rwe will hear for ourselves\rif a honeybee can actually speak.\r\rWhat have we gotten into here, Barry?\r\rIt's pretty big, isn't it?\r\rI can't believe how many humans\rdon't work during the day.\r\rYou think billion-dollar multinational\rfood companies have good lawyers?\r\rEverybody needs to stay\rbehind the barricade.\r\r- What's the matter?\r- I don't know, I just got a chill.\r\rWell, if it isn't the bee team.\r\rYou boys work on this?\r\rAll rise! The Honorable\rJudge Bumbleton presiding.\r\rAll right. Oase number 4475,\r\rSuperior Oourt of New York,\rBarry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry\r\ris now in session.\r\rMr. Montgomery, you're representing\rthe five food companies collectively?\r\rA privilege.\r\rMr. Benson... you're representing\rall the bees of the world?\r\rI'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,\rwe're ready to proceed.\r\rMr. Montgomery,\ryour opening statement, please.\r\rLadies and gentlemen of the jury,\r\rmy grandmother was a simple woman.\r\rBorn on a farm, she believed\rit was man's divine right\r\rto benefit from the bounty\rof nature God put before us.\r\rIf we lived in the topsy-turvy world\rMr. Benson imagines,\r\rjust think of what would it mean.\r\rI would have to negotiate\rwith the silkworm\r\rfor the elastic in my britches!\r\rTalking bee!\r\rHow do we know this isn't some sort of\r\rholographic motion-picture-capture\rHollywood wizardry?\r\rThey could be using laser beams!\r\rRobotics! Ventriloquism!\rOloning! For all we know,\r\rhe could be on steroids!\r\rMr. Benson?\r\rLadies and gentlemen,\rthere's no trickery here.\r\rI'm just an ordinary bee.\rHoney's pretty important to me.\r\rIt's important to all bees.\rWe invented it!\r\rWe make it. And we protect it\rwith our lives.\r\rUnfortunately, there are\rsome people in this room\r\rwho think they can take it from us\r\r'cause we're the little guys!\rI'm hoping that, after this is all over,\r\ryou'll see how, by taking our honey,\ryou not only take everything we have\r\rbut everything we are!\r\rI wish he'd dress like that\rall the time. So nice!\r\rOall your first witness.\r\rSo, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden\rof Honey Farms, big company you have.\r\rI suppose so.\r\rI see you also own\rHoneyburton and Honron!\r\rYes, they provide beekeepers\rfor our farms.\r\rBeekeeper. I find that\rto be a very disturbing term.\r\rI don't imagine you employ\rany bee-free-ers, do you?\r\r- No.\r- I couldn't hear you.\r\r- No.\r- No.\r\rBecause you don't free bees.\rYou keep bees. Not only that,\r\rit seems you thought a bear would be\ran appropriate image for a jar of honey.\r\rThey're very lovable creatures.\r\rYogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.\r\rYou mean like this?\r\rBears kill bees!\r\rHow'd you like his head crashing\rthrough your living room?!\r\rBiting into your couch!\rSpitting out your throw pillows!\r\rOK, that's enough. Take him away.\r\rSo, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.\rYour name intrigues me.\r\r- Where have I heard it before?\r- I was with a band called The Police.\r\rBut you've never been\ra police officer, have you?\r\rNo, I haven't.\r\rNo, you haven't. And so here\rwe have yet another example\r\rof bee culture casually\rstolen by a human\r\rfor nothing more than\ra prance-about stage name.\r\rOh, please.\r\rHave you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?\r\rBecause I'm feeling\ra little stung, Sting.\r\rOr should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!\r\rThat's not his real name?! You idiots!\r\rMr. Liotta, first,\rbelated congratulations on\r\ryour Emmy win for a guest spot\ron ER in 2005.\r\rThank you. Thank you.\r\rI see from your resume\rthat you're devilishly handsome\r\rwith a churning inner turmoil\rthat's ready to blow.\r\rI enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?\r\rNot yet it isn't. But is this\rwhat it's come to for you?\r\rExploiting tiny, helpless bees\rso you don't\r\rhave to rehearse\ryour part and learn your lines, sir?\r\rWatch it, Benson!\rI could blow right now!\r\rThis isn't a goodfella.\rThis is a badfella!\r\rWhy doesn't someone just step on\rthis creep, and we can all go home?!\r\r- Order in this court!\r- You're all thinking it!\r\rOrder! Order, I say!\r\r- Say it!\r- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!\r\rI think it was awfully nice\rof that bear to pitch in like that.\r\rI think the jury's on our side.\r\rAre we doing everything right, legally?\r\rI'm a florist.\r\rRight. Well, here's to a great team.\r\rTo a great team!\r\rWell, hello.\r\r- Ken!\r- Hello.\r\rI didn't think you were coming.\r\rNo, I was just late.\rI tried to call, but... the battery.\r\rI didn't want all this to go to waste,\rso I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.\r\rOh, that was lucky.\r\rThere's a little left.\rI could heat it up.\r\rYeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.\r\rSo I hear you're quite a tennis player.\r\rI'm not much for the game myself.\rThe ball's a little grabby.\r\rThat's where I usually sit.\rRight... there.\r\rKen, Barry was looking at your resume,\r\rand he agreed with me that eating with\rchopsticks isn't really a special skill.\r\rYou think I don't see what you're doing?\r\rI know how hard it is to find\rthe rightjob. We have that in common.\r\rDo we?\r\rBees have 100 percent employment,\rbut we do jobs like taking the crud out.\r\rThat's just what\rI was thinking about doing.\r\rKen, I let Barry borrow your razor\rfor his fuzz. I hope that was all right.\r\rI'm going to drain the old stinger.\r\rYeah, you do that.\r\rLook at that.\r\rYou know, I've just about had it\r\rwith your little mind games.\r\r- What's that?\r- Italian Vogue.\r\rMamma mia, that's a lot of pages.\r\rA lot of ads.\r\rRemember what Van said, why is\ryour life more valuable than mine?\r\rFunny, I just can't seem to recall that!\r\rI think something stinks in here!\r\rI love the smell of flowers.\r\rHow do you like the smell of flames?!\r\rNot as much.\r\rWater bug! Not taking sides!\r\rKen, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!\rThis is pathetic!\r\rI've got issues!\r\rWell, well, well, a royal flush!\r\r- You're bluffing.\r- Am I?\r\rSurf's up, dude!\r\rPoo water!\r\rThat bowl is gnarly.\r\rExcept for those dirty yellow rings!\r\rKenneth! What are you doing?!\r\rYou know, I don't even like honey!\rI don't eat it!\r\rWe need to talk!\r\rHe's just a little bee!\r\rAnd he happens to be\rthe nicest bee I've met in a long time!\r\rLong time? What are you talking about?!\rAre there other bugs in your life?\r\rNo, but there are other things bugging\rme in life. And you're one of them!\r\rFine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...\r\rMy nerves are fried from riding\ron this emotional roller coaster!\r\rGoodbye, Ken.\r\rAnd for your information,\r\rI prefer sugar-free, artificial\rsweeteners made by man!\r\rI'm sorry about all that.\r\rI know it's got\ran aftertaste! I like it!\r\rI always felt there was some kind\rof barrier between Ken and me.\r\rI couldn't overcome it.\rOh, well.\r\rAre you OK for the trial?\r\rI believe Mr. Montgomery\ris about out of ideas.\r\rWe would like to call\rMr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.\r\rGood idea! You can really see why he's\rconsidered one of the best lawyers...\r\rYeah.\r\rLayton, you've\rgotta weave some magic\r\rwith this jury,\ror it's gonna be all over.\r\rDon't worry. The only thing I have\rto do to turn this jury around\r\ris to remind them\rof what they don't like about bees.\r\r- You got the tweezers?\r- Are you allergic?\r\rOnly to losing, son. Only to losing.\r\rMr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you\rwhat I think we'd all like to know.\r\rWhat exactly is your relationship\r\rto that woman?\r\rWe're friends.\r\r- Good friends?\r- Yes.\r\rHow good? Do you live together?\r\rWait a minute...\r\rAre you her little...\r\r...bedbug?\r\rI've seen a bee documentary or two.\rFrom what I understand,\r\rdoesn't your queen give birth\rto all the bee children?\r\r- Yeah, but...\r- So those aren't your real parents!\r\r- Oh, Barry...\r- Yes, they are!\r\rHold me back!\r\rYou're an illegitimate bee,\raren't you, Benson?\r\rHe's denouncing bees!\r\rDon't y'all date your cousins?\r\r- Objection!\r- I'm going to pincushion this guy!\r\rAdam, don't! It's what he wants!\r\rOh, I'm hit!!\r\rOh, lordy, I am hit!\r\rOrder! Order!\r\rThe venom! The venom\ris coursing through my veins!\r\rI have been felled\rby a winged beast of destruction!\r\rYou see? You can't treat them\rlike equals! They're striped savages!\r\rStinging's the only thing\rthey know! It's their way!\r\r- Adam, stay with me.\r- I can't feel my legs.\r\rWhat angel of mercy\rwill come forward to suck the poison\r\rfrom my heaving buttocks?\r\rI will have order in this court. Order!\r\rOrder, please!\r\rThe case of the honeybees\rversus the human race\r\rtook a pointed turn against the bees\r\ryesterday when one of their legal\rteam stung Layton T. Montgomery.\r\r- Hey, buddy.\r- Hey.\r\r- Is there much pain?\r- Yeah.\r\rI...\r\rI blew the whole case, didn't I?\r\rIt doesn't matter. What matters is\ryou're alive. You could have died.\r\rI'd be better off dead. Look at me.\r\rThey got it from the cafeteria\rdownstairs, in a tuna sandwich.\r\rLook, there's\ra little celery still on it.\r\rWhat was it like to sting someone?\r\rI can't explain it. It was all...\r\rAll adrenaline and then...\rand then ecstasy!\r\rAll right.\r\rYou think it was all a trap?\r\rOf course. I'm sorry.\rI flew us right into this.\r\rWhat were we thinking? Look at us. We're\rjust a couple of bugs in this world.\r\rWhat will the humans do to us\rif they win?\r\rI don't know.\r\rI hear they put the roaches in motels.\rThat doesn't sound so bad.\r\rAdam, they check in,\rbut they don't check out!\r\rOh, my.\r\rOould you get a nurse\rto close that window?\r\r- Why?\r- The smoke.\r\rBees don't smoke.\r\rRight. Bees don't smoke.\r\rBees don't smoke!\rBut some bees are smoking.\r\rThat's it! That's our case!\r\rIt is? It's not over?\r\rGet dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.\r\rGet back to the court and stall.\rStall any way you can.\r\rAnd assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.\r\rMr. Flayman.\r\rYes? Yes, Your Honor!\r\rWhere is the rest of your team?\r\rWell, Your Honor, it's interesting.\r\rBees are trained to fly haphazardly,\r\rand as a result,\rwe don't make very good time.\r\rI actually heard a funny story about...\r\rYour Honor,\rhaven't these ridiculous bugs\r\rtaken up enough\rof this court's valuable time?\r\rHow much longer will we allow\rthese absurd shenanigans to go on?\r\rThey have presented no compelling\revidence to support their charges\r\ragainst my clients,\rwho run legitimate businesses.\r\rI move for a complete dismissal\rof this entire case!\r\rMr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going\r\rto have to consider\rMr. Montgomery's motion.\r\rBut you can't! We have a terrific case.\r\rWhere is your proof?\rWhere is the evidence?\r\rShow me the smoking gun!\r\rHold it, Your Honor!\rYou want a smoking gun?\r\rHere is your smoking gun.\r\rWhat is that?\r\rIt's a bee smoker!\r\rWhat, this?\rThis harmless little contraption?\r\rThis couldn't hurt a fly,\rlet alone a bee.\r\rLook at what has happened\r\rto bees who have never been asked,\r\"Smoking or non?\"\r\rIs this what nature intended for us?\r\rTo be forcibly addicted\rto smoke machines\r\rand man-made wooden slat work camps?\r\rLiving out our lives as honey slaves\rto the white man?\r\r- What are we gonna do?\r- He's playing the species card.\r\rLadies and gentlemen, please,\rfree these bees!\r\rFree the bees! Free the bees!\r\rFree the bees!\r\rFree the bees! Free the bees!\r\rThe court finds in favor of the bees!\r\rVanessa, we won!\r\rI knew you could do it! High-five!\r\rSorry.\r\rI'm OK! You know what this means?\r\rAll the honey\rwill finally belong to the bees.\r\rNow we won't have\rto work so hard all the time.\r\rThis is an unholy perversion\rof the balance of nature, Benson.\r\rYou'll regret this.\r\rBarry, how much honey is out there?\r\rAll right. One at a time.\r\rBarry, who are you wearing?\r\rMy sweater is Ralph Lauren,\rand I have no pants.\r\r- What if Montgomery's right?\r- What do you mean?\r\rWe've been living the bee way\ra long time, 27 million years.\r\rOongratulations on your victory.\rWhat will you demand as a settlement?\r\rFirst, we'll demand a complete shutdown\rof all bee work camps.\r\rThen we want back the honey\rthat was ours to begin with,\r\revery last drop.\r\rWe demand an end to the glorification\rof the bear as anything more\r\rthan a filthy, smelly,\rbad-breath stink machine.\r\rWe're all aware\rof what they do in the woods.\r\rWait for my signal.\r\rTake him out.\r\rHe'll have nauseous\rfor a few hours, then he'll be fine.\r\rAnd we will no longer tolerate\rbee-negative nicknames...\r\rBut it's just a prance-about stage name!\r\r...unnecessary inclusion of honey\rin bogus health products\r\rand la-dee-da human\rtea-time snack garnishments.\r\rOan't breathe.\r\rBring it in, boys!\r\rHold it right there! Good.\r\rTap it.\r\rMr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,\rand there's gallons more coming!\r\r- I think we need to shut down!\r- Shut down? We've never shut down.\r\rShut down honey production!\r\rStop making honey!\r\rTurn your key, sir!\r\rWhat do we do now?\r\rOannonball!\r\rWe're shutting honey production!\r\rMission abort.\r\rAborting pollination and nectar detail.\rReturning to base.\r\rAdam, you wouldn't believe\rhow much honey was out there.\r\rOh, yeah?\r\rWhat's going on? Where is everybody?\r\r- Are they out celebrating?\r- They're home.\r\rThey don't know what to do.\rLaying out, sleeping in.\r\rI heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way\rto San Antonio with a cricket.\r\rAt least we got our honey back.\r\rSometimes I think, so what if humans\rliked our honey? Who wouldn't?\r\rIt's the greatest thing in the world!\rI was excited to be part of making it.\r\rThis was my new desk. This was my\rnew job.

You feel the connection between these two characters, and this is when the animation rivals that of Cory in the House in terms of quality and beauty. There's also the underlying social commentary about bees and how they should be allowed to have relationships with humans. As a supporter of the \"Let Bees Love Humans\" empidemic that's sweeping America, I feel this movie presents the topic in a very relatable yet cruel way that just drives home the message of being allowed to love who you want, regardless of whether it's ethically wrong. In conclusion, Bee Movie is easily one of the best animes of all time. If your two season fill of CITH (Cory In The House) didn't satisfy you then BM (Bee Movie) will deliver."

The film has some good ideas, occasional clever jokes, and nice animation/score. However, the film is bogged down by trying way too hard to funny resulting in a lot of bad puns and comes across a bit more obnoxious than funny. I\u2019d say if you have kids show it to them they\u2019ll mindlessly enjoy it. For everyone else though check it out if you want but I\u2019m not going to highly recommend this film. It has some funny moments but not  enough to make this a great comedy like Shrek 1 & 2. Shame that a studio that has made great movies could make something that ranges from mediocre to decent."

Not too many laugh-out-loud moments, but it did keep a constant smirk on my face. I found the casual way the movie deals with surreal situations quite refreshing--no strained attempts at credibility to bog it down. The CG is pretty good, slick yet not painstakingly detailed. A lot of memorable snarky bits (Ray Liotta and Sting cameos in particular). Worth seeing if you enjoy subtle, sardonic humor."
