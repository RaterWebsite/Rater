      "text": "This true story of the breaking of the enigma code, which effectively ended World War 2, could so easily have turned out to be one of those overly clich\u00e9d and conventional bio-pics. However, in the hands of director Morten Tyldum it has, surprisingly, become so much more. Starting with a smart and dense screenplay, which hones in on three different periods of time in the life of code breaker Alan Turing, the story is utterly compelling. Wisely, it has also been told in a straightforward and un complicated manner and after about 10 minutes one gets a dizzying sense that the film is going to be an absolute gem, a feeling that reaches fulfilment 2 hours later as the credits roll.\rThe recreation of time and place has been lovingly captured via excellent production design. In fact, the film is rich in detail. There are breathtaking vistas of war torn Britain which includes shots of bombers wreaking devastation over London and submarines firing rockets, as well as more ordinary depictions of rubble strewn streets and houses. It is also good to see the appropriate use of historic Bletchley Park as a backdrop to where all these events actually unfolded over 70 years ago. The editing seamlessly takes us from year to year without confusion or jarring transitions and the scenes leading up to, and immediately following, the breaking of the code are just thrilling. The music is another plus and whilst not particularly melodic it underscores what is happening on screen brilliantly.\rCriticism has been levelled at the film for not focusing more on Turing\u2019s sexuality which is as untrue as it is unfair. Beyond seeing him actually bonking we have more than enough information as to the effect his sexuality had on his life and, ultimately his death. Scenes of his childhood also give insight into the man he would become. End titles, unlike the recent \u2018Foxcatcher\u2019 are also helpful and informative.\rUltimately, the film belongs to its powerful cast. Benedict Cumberbatch is a revelation and he brings real humanity to the tortured Turing. Some of his moments, particularly near the end, are almost unbearably moving.  Keira Knightley is almost his equal in a smaller but crucial role. She has real power here as Turing\u2019s one time fianc\u00e9, the lone woman breaker who as it turns out is better than the men. Supporting actors Charles Dance, Rory Kinnear and Mark Strong all contribute characters that are more than mere ciphers. Also, it is to the credit of the boy playing Turing as a young man that we believe in the subsequent actions and performance of Cumberbatch.\rRarely is a film as all encompassing and engrossing as this one. It is a triumph on every level and a cinematic treat."

The storyline was always going to be fascinating, and this is paced very well, with a thorough and considered script enabling what could be a somewhat 'been there' war drama a more poignant note.

Co-written by Andrew Hodges (based on his book \"Alan Turing: The Enigma\") and Graham Moore, the film was ably directed by Morten Tyldum and tells of the extraordinary efforts of one man, Alan Turing, to create what was basically the first known computer. The information the film imparts and the tremendous undertaking of Turing and his aides  to help shorten the war and save millions of lives will hold the interest of the audience to its exciting and unexpected climax.

      "text": "First movie review, alright here we go,\rThe Imitation Game is without a doubt one of the best film's I've seen in 2014, based on a true story, the film is based on the life of Alan Turing and how his genius saved England from Nazi, Germany.\r The film is set in the World War 2 and the Germans are getting the advantage over England because they are using cryptic messages to each other to plan attacks or change strategies, these cryptic messages are known as the ENIGMA code and its supposed to be the most unbreakable code in the world, and it's up to Turing and his team of geniuses to crack the code.\r Now the plot of this film is so good, at times it can show entertaining, emotional or tense scenes and it all works so perfectly. You even get to see flashbacks from Turing childhood and find out how he becomes the man or should I say hero of his time and even the today's modern era.\r Now about the characters in this film, Benedict Cumberbatch does an amazing job as Alan Turing, and what about Turing himself well all I'll say is that he is such a smart, to the point, and sees the world in a completely different way, that's what makes him so interesting, however the other characters in this film aren't really that interesting.\r So if your a fan of history or a fan of Benedict Cumberbatch or just enjoy great films, than The Imitation Game is just for you."

Benedict Cumberbatch turns in a great performance as Turing, an egotistical anti-social professor and closet homosexual, which in Britain at that time could result in prison.\rWhile historical purists chafe at the nit picking details, it's still a very compelling, intelligent movie that grips you from the start and brings the accomplishments of Turing's work into fresh focus.    He tragically died of what is considered suicide by cyanide, although some think it could have been an accident during one of his experiments when he inhaled cyanide fumes while working on a project.\rHe was found guilty of homosexual behavior and ordered to undergo inhumane drug therapy that was designed to basically destroy his sex drive and chemically castrate him.\rIn death though Turing was finally accorded the hero's acclaim he deserved, and today is considered one of the first great pioneers of the modern computer.\r\"The Imitation Game\" is a brilliant film, and a great relief from the load of hit movies out there right now."

How was hard the path Dr.Turing took to decipher German code during World War II, starting from his enrollment in the British army, and the jealousy of his colleagues, and his own non-sociable character. With the help of a lady of his team, Keira Knightley, he could step by step have his colleagues in his side. To have his project continue Turing married Mss Knightley, she accepted despite his revelation of being homosexual. Lastly they all succeeded in deciphering German code and win the war. Everything is over, the project should be kept as it never happened, and the teammate never met. Dr. Turing back home accused of homosexuality, committed suicide after going through forceful castration to avoid jail. A movie  that deserve-fully earn the applaud of the audience."

      "text": "If there is a role of eccentric genius in near future, it will either land on Benedict Cumberbatch or be inevitably compared to his on The Imitation Game. As homage for a prestigious man, he displays acting caliber of the highest level. He dons the personality and quirks, brings out the best and also most fragile quality of a character. In no overstatement, he introduces a man on-screen and makes audience sympathizes with him as he should be appreciated in life.\r His role as Alan Turing is as splendid as one could hope be represented with. This probably rivals Russell Crows's performance in A Beautiful Mind. That being said, the rest of cast performs beautifully as well. Keira Knightley as Joan Clarke is wonderful. She's not flashy or extravagance in this role, instead she is deceptively bland, but has a more approachable and kind nature. Her demeanor is calming, also effective in bringing a pinch of innocence on time of war. The charming accent doesn't hurt either.\r Script are well done, dialogues fit the characters in less complicated way. It helps significantly since the theme is already a complex one, yet the underlying message is resoundingly clear, it need not to be deciphered. Character interaction feels authentic, from the honest troubling confession to the more awkward banter, even though some of these must have been slight exaggerated for cinema. Still, it's a nice way to convey their feelings.\r Pacing is meticulously done, often the movie strolls between different timelines, and manages to highlight each portion with timely fashion. The transition doesn't feel forced, it moves just the way it should naturally. It cleverly depicts Alan Turing's life, the better part and also lonely part of his time.\r The Imitation Game has a heavy undertaking of presenting a man's personal story, and with excellent acting and amazing script, it has done so marvelously."

      "text": "The Imitation Game is a biopic and historical film, but it never becomes boring, the dynamism is well achieved by telling the story in three different times: Alan in the school, Alan at world war II trying to break Enigma (by itself a great story for a movie) and Alan in the present, when he is nothing but ordinary. The big thing is how these three tales are mixed up to reveal the real essence of the protagonist, his objectives, joys, fears and concerns. The complexity of this character is beyond imagination, there are no words to describe Benedict Cumberbatch's performance, probably nobody could have done better; he definitely carries the movie on his shoulders. And by his side is Keira Knightley, whom maybe gave us her best acting in years. The problems start because the emphasis on the characters is so huge, that other things are left behind and not well appreciated, like the clever screenplay, the beautiful score and the coherent cinematography. However, as the story goes by, you discover the strong message behind it exposing one more time the awful nature of human being. At least there movies like this one to teach us, better late than never."

Throughout Cumberbatch shows true passion for playing this character causing much emotion when necessary but some comedic elements as well. From time to time you feel for Turing as he makes his attempts to crack Enigma. Not only does Cumberbatch provide emotion but the other cast members are at the same level. Joan Clarke (Kiera Knightley) the female member of the group is as allows you to see such a strong bond developing between the two of them making them a great pair when they are on-screen together. The bond also extends to the other mathematicians like Hugh Alexander (Matthew Goode) and John Cairncross (Allen Leech) which incites a sort of family between them expressing not only the darker moments but some of the comedic elements from time to time.\r The story itself was incredible and kept me interested and engaged throughout. The film does put the emphasis on the Enigma code causing an awareness of how important the code really is. This emphasis does impact the story greatly in a positive way. During the film there are some extremely emotive scenes that envelope the audience die to the horrors of war and the importance of Enigma. The pacing was well done allowing time for not only the codebreaking itself but allow development of the characters and to see the changes of their understanding to not only Turing but to the code Enigma itself. There is a small part I did trip up on and did not understand however upon re-watching the film and investigating further it had become clearer. The most shocking part I found was the ending which makes me feel sad but more knowledgeable at the same time knowing what had happened within World War II and the factor that Turing played in.\r In all the Imitation game was an excellent film depicting the behind the scenes of the spy network. It was great to see such emphasis being placed on the codebreaking rather than action which most spy films are affiliated with. The story of the code breaking is enhanced even further through all the actors.

The powerful performance from Benedict Cumberbatch alone in portraying the awkwardness, triumphant, arrogant, strangeness, both physical and mental struggling of this notorious protagonist and at the same time well supported by great delivery from the supporting cast have elevated this epic material entirely.

Known for his expertise as a mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, and philosopher, he was a pioneering computer scientist who created the template for what would become the computers we use today. However, his accomplishments were never publicly known due to his criminal prosecution for being a homosexual.\rBenedict Cumberbatch stars as Turing, and along with his team of code-breakers, were responsible for cracking Nazi Germany's Enigma code. This is particularly important as this was the Nazi's primary code for communicating with its forces around the world. Many of the worlds brightest minds had tried and failed to find the solution to the complex code, but it was this group of minds at Britains top-secret overnment Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park (Charles Dance), a head strong military man with his suspicions about Turing, and MI6's Stewart Menzies (Mark Strong), who has a keen interest in the results of the groups work.\rAfter several unsuccessful tries at breaking the code, Turing began his work to develop a machine that could find a way to break the code on its own. Turing took his thoughts directly to Prime Minister Winston Churchill and was given ultimate power over the project. Assembling a team which consisted of scholars, mathematicians, linguists, a chess champion, the team continued to search for an answer to the riddle while Turing began his work on the machine. Turing, being a socially awkward person, found it difficult to work in a group setting and alienated himself from his coworkers. The caring voice of Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley), a brilliant mathematician who would aid Turing into winning the trust of his team, would become his most trusted confidant. The clock was ticking on the group to crack the code as the war began to reach a breaking point for the allies. The pressure to achieve his life's goal was beginning to take hold.\rWe experience the troubled childhood of the young genius as his deals with the loss of his most cherished love, we endure the journey of the genius responsible for the end of the war, and we suffer through the the tragedy of his post-war decline following his conviction for gross indecency, but we are rewarded with the story of a brave, tortured soul who became a national treasure. The performance of Benedict Cumberbatch is one to cherish. The portrayal of such a frail human spirit who defied the odds and shaped the history of the world is inspiring and Oscar worthy. Keira Knightley is strong, charming and a perfect compliment to Cumberbatch. Each scene between the two was magical. Matthew Goode is tremendous as Turing's reluctant ally. Goode engaged his characters spirit head on and challenged Cumberbatch's Turing as a chess champion would. Each member of the remaining cast, including the wonderful Mark Strong, was sensational with each providing a wonderful compliment to the telling of the story.\rOverall, The Imitation Game is an absolute treasure and should no doubt hear its name called at nomination time this year. A captivating story of loss and tragedy, but also one of triumphant victory which will no doubt engulf you in your thoughts of how sexual persecution has crippled our society for too long. Alan Turing deserved better, thankfully he has finally gotten his due."

The director keeps up the tension throughout. A beautifully made film, and although I have not seen all of the competition, certainly Cumberbatch's performance is Academy-Award-Nomination level."

      "text": "I work at Bletchley Park and when I asked my colleagues what they thought about this film they were all scathing. I watched the film with a notebook beside me and filled two A4 sides of notes with historical and technical inaccuracies!!\r Anybody who knows absolutely nothing about the wartime history BP and the history of Alan Turing, both at the Park and after he left, will - no doubt - find this a very entertaining film! Those who DO know the history of BP during the war, and the part played by Alan Turing, will find this film the biggest load of garbage ever - not to mention an insult to both Bletchley Park and Alan Turing!!\r I'm not surprised that Benedict Cumberbatch was nominated for an Oscar but it was for his acting ability and certainly not for an accurate portayal of AT! Those who describe this film as: \"Brilliant\"; \"Genius\"; \"Magnificent\" etc etc, obviously know absolutely nothing about what REALLY went on at BP during the war and the part played by AT.\r You mention the name \"Bletchley Park\" to most people and they think: \"Enigma and Alan Turing\"! This is wholly due to the blind promotionof the Park as being entirely the home of Enigma and Alan Turing! He was one of between 8,000 and 10,000 people who worked there and there were many people who contributed just as much as he did, if not more, that nobody has ever heard of!\r For Instance: Col John Tiltman; Bill Tutte; Prof Max Newman; Major Ralph Tester; Tommy Flowers, Alan Coombs; Sid Broadhurst and many, many others. These were the people responsible for breaking the German Lorenz code, and making the machines that did it, that was used by Hitler and the High Command who did not want to use Enigma, but who has ever heard of these people? The forgotten genius's of Bletchley Park!\r BP did NOT revolve aroung Enigma and Alan Turing but thanks to modern TV, films and the such like we are all led to believe that this is, in fact, the case.\r If you visit Bletchley Park make sure you visit The National Museum of Computing that tells the entire story of Lorenz, Hitler and the High Command - it might surprise you!! That is the OTHER side of wartime codebreaking that very few people actually know about!"

      "text": "A shockingly dull rewrite of history, the only highpoint of which is Cumberbatch's above average performance. The script is sloppy, the narrative bloated and is literally brimming with falsehoods, inaccuracies and downright lies. If you know anything at all about Turing or the history of Ultra, then this film will not fail to irritate. The exaggerated attention to detail in terms of wardrobe only exacerbates the director's complete disregard for historical accuracy, which is frankly bizarre given the fascinating real history that the film pretends to dramatize. Hysterical trash to make Daily Mail readers feel like Britain single-handedly won the war."

      "text": "THE IMITATION GAME is a 'nice\" movie. And that's it's core problem. This middle-brow entertainment makes WWII, misogyny, and homophobia digestible for an audience that clearly does not want to be challenged or believe the world can truly suck. The film feels like a network TV movie from the 1980s which would deal with adult issues all with a very pretty little bow and a post-script that would often indicate the opposite. In its last moments, THE IMITATION GAME, suddenly underscores the homosexuality of Alan Turing who is depicted as asexual throughout. So why the fuss? And then there is the plot driven AH-HAH moment when out of a simple convo the enigma code is broken! Isn't it time we stopped making films like this?"

      "text": "\u201cThe Imitation Game\u201d is that rarity, an almost perfect film. The technical and scientific aspect will be satisfying to nerds and not so detailed to go over the heads of the rest of the audience. The acting is natural, believable and gets you involved with the lives of all the individual. Though it covers many serious subjects there are quite a few laugh out loud lines and scenes spring from the natural aspects of the characters.\r For those who never heard of Alan Turing he was an English mathematical genius who broke the German Enigma code and is said to be responsible for WW2 ending 2-4 years earlier than it would have. He also was arrested for being a homosexual in 1951 and was given the choice of prison or chemical castration. He was to eventually commit suicide though his mother contends that it was an accident.\r Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing shows the man\u2019s brilliance while at the same time shows that he wasn\u2019t comfortable around people and offering all around him humor by his lack of social understanding. Keira Knightley as Joan Clarke the only female member of the group who worked on the Enigma code and accepts Turing proposal of marriage. Each member of the group are comfortable in their roles with Matthew Goode, described as a \u2018cad\u2019, a standout. Charles Dance, Mark Strong, Allen Leech, Rory Kinnear, Mattew Beard and Alex Lawther as the young Turing, all add to the strength of the film.\r The screenplay by Graham Moore is sharp, the direction by Morten Tyldum moves things smoothly along and handles the alternating between the three different time periods without any confusion.\r Right now Cumberbatch is the front runner for the Best Actor Oscar, deservingly so, and the movie is on many 10 best lists. Though I feel what makes it from being a perfect movie is how he was brought down in his life, his homosexuality, is sort of slighted from how/why he was caught and the society that made it a crime at that time.\r \u201cThe Imitation Game, is a must see movie for anyone who likes an intelligent, emotionally moving finely acted film."

This movie explores the life of Alan Turing who broke the enigma code used by the Germans during the world war. The amount of tension between each scene is JAW DROPPING, seriously.  The battle scenes are harrowing, the emotion is intense. This movie actually inspires you to make something great or do something great like Alan Turing. The Imitation Game is one of the best movies of the year, and my favorite biography movies of all time. Watch this movie,  its worth it, trust me. 10/10."

      "text": "The Imitation Game isn\u2019t just a film about breaking codes but a man\u2019s struggle between logic and emotion, man vs. machine, and above all else dealing with being different. This personal story allowed me to get invested in the film in a way that I couldn\u2019t\u2019 have otherwise. Alan Tuning\u2019s story is one that I was able to relate to with Bennedict Cumberbatch doing a wonderful job portraying the character. Along with this gripping story the film also has the intense conflict of the codebreaking, is well acted, and well shot. I would highly recommend this film to everyone especially anyone who felt like the black sheep growing up. Don\u2019t be surprised if you find yourself on the screen and bring some tissues if you are emotional its not a happy story and if you are sensitive you will probably shed a tear. Happy this film is getting Oscar buzz and wish it the best of luck at the Oscars as it deserves all the recognition it can get. As for Cumberbatch I hope this if the first of many excellent films eh will star in."

      "text": "A Gay Man Saves 14 Million Lives Throughout the World....by shortening humanity\u2019s worst war of all time by at least two years! He may even have saved the life of my own beloved grandfather who worked in the Brooklyn (New York) Navel Yard all throughout World War 2! A military target that would have eventually been within reach of German submarines.\r If it wasn\u2019t for Alan Turing\u2019s genius, integrity and perseverance all of history would have been changed for the worse. Another minor footnote: He\u2019s also the father of the modern computer and one of the greatest mathematicians who ever lived.\r Despite being one of the giants of the 20th century, few people outside those with a passion for history or computing have ever heard of the man until now. No universities or streets are named after him. No statues or portrait honor him anywhere in the world all because he is gay. In fact, it took the Queen of England to the year 2013 to issue him a pardon for having consensual sex - in the privacy of his home - with another man! In 2013! That\u2019s an abomination. The Queen of England is sitting on her throne in one piece because of this man! She should have laid a wreath on his grave decades ago!\r I\u2019m not ashamed to admit it, but I sobbed at the end of this movie! This is a most profound story about love!  YES! LOVE! Intense, passionate love is not limited to just heterosexuals!\r It\u2019s also a story about sex. I was born in the 1960\u2019s and consensual sex - in the privacy of one\u2019s home - between men was legal in the State I was living in when I turned 18. But the stigma of being a sexual minority remains in way too many places \u2013 and affects me greatly in my own personal life to this very day. The pain I \u2013 and others \u2013 have suffered for being \u201cdifferent\u201d is indescribable. This story validates my experiences and the experiences of millions of other sexual minorities \u2013 from around the world - both living and deceased.\r The cruelty Alan Turing experienced from his classmate is similar to what I had to endure in high school. But I was lucky; I never had to worry about having consensual sex with another man in the privacy of my own home. But in Alan Turing\u2019s case you get to see a good man who gave so incredibly much to the world be ripped apart by pure evil that was 100% legal back in the 1950\u2019s! It\u2019s so ironic too! Watch closely. The police officer breaks the law and he is the one who should be legitimately imprisoned! It\u2019s not just in the United States that police officers feel they are above the law they supposedly serve!\r Memo to Hollywood: This shows you know how to make great movies. Sure, you won\u2019t make billions every time, but you\u2019re gonna make a tidy profit by doing a spectacular job. Wouldn\u2019t you rather make a film people will be watching 500 years from now on another planet in another solar system then making trash, like The Hobbit trilogy, that no will care about once it leaves the theaters?\r One more point to ponder: Michelangelo is considered by most people to be the greatest sculptor who ever lived. He was a gay man and he lived centuries ago - in peace - till he reached 88 (Yes 8-8). Now fast-forward to the 1950\u2019s - in what was supposedly the country that birthed modern democracy - and look what the British did to one of the greatest mathematicians that ever lived only because he is gay!"

The movie is compelling but you can tell when Hollywood adds a part here and there for emotional impact and you feel a little manipulated.  His personality reminded me of Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory, so maybe they were taking advantage of his current popularity as well.  The other actors were all fine, but Cumberbatch really carries this film.  The film looks good, too."
