I played the games, I\u2019ve bought each iteration from DVD to 4K\u2026yet this movie\u2026this is not a Matrix movie to me. This was a parody. The acting, the lighting, the choreography, the script, the overall story all failed.I went and watched the original after watching this and literally on 4K the 22 year old movie looks better. This was\u2026a waste. Id rather it had never been made. I give it a 3 instead of a 0 simply because I love the Matrix, but there isn\u2019t much to love here."

From the re-hashed story, to the constant usage of footage from the first film, to the lack of an intersting story and the bloated 2 hour 30 min runtime.  The casting of Doogie Howser as the big bad guy was the worst casting choice possibly ever in the history of Sci-Fi movies.  This movie also showed  just how bad an actor Keanu Reeves really is.  He is passable is other movies but here he was absoloute trash.  If this is all Wachowski can come up, then please never make another film.  You had a hit with the first film, milked 2 more that were barley passable, and this is a pile of festing dog crap."

      "text": "There is inevitably going to be a lot of political backlash around this film from angry people who don't like some of the changes that threaten the cool masculinity of the original films.  For me, those changes weren't a major issue, and if anything were some of the more entertaining aspects of the movie.  There were a few moments that felt a little overbearing, but nothing too egregious.The real issue is that the movie just isn't very good.  The music was bland, the CGI was ugly, the editing was bad, the choreography was uninteresting and the action was occasionally hard to read a la the Bourne films, the cinematography was lifeless, the script was pretty abysmal, with several interesting ideas all executed poorly.  The use of flashbacks were atrocious.  The meta commentary immediately wore thin.  While this is definitely not a full retread of older Matrix films, it still carries the baggage of one.  Huge swaths of the movie are just people explaining things to the audience.  The earlier movies are somewhat guilty of this, but Keanu just doesn't work as an audience surrogate or as an engaging character here and we are mostly taken out of the film as a result. Keanu lacks the intensity he had when he was younger, leaving him to mostly just appear bored, and the flat framing and editing does nothing to help remedy that.  This especially comes across in the action, such as when he's jumping away from an explosion and it really feels like an old dude jumping in front of a green screen.  The newcomers were fine, but the Morpheus surrogate didn't feel anything like Morpheus or the other character he's meant to embody.  The whole thing felt like a made for TV movie with a bigger budget that went almost entirely to bad CGI.  Carrie-Anne Moss is fine, which is good because her character is integral to the better aspects of the plot, but Keanu really is the crux of the film and fails to carry it.  The new villains do not work.  This honestly just doesn't feel like a Matrix movie.  It feels like a pitch with some salvageable ideas in it."

      "text": "Honestly, I'm a fan of Wachowski movies. I think they're special filmmakers - unconventional and somewhat profound. From The Matrix to Cloud Atlas to Jupiter Ascending, and even the much maligned Matrix Revolutions I've found them all brilliantly intriguing. However, The Matrix Resurrections is a different movie.It differs so much from its original trilogy the only commonalities they share are their titles and characters. This movie looks modern, polished, and very in the times - a whole lot more than the trilogy that precedes it but it unfortunately, ends up feeling much cheaper and very conventional.There's some beautiful CGI and Visual Effects, some of which is entirely impressive. So the movie looks good enough and properly 2021. It also presents concepts that shine and introduce some new ideas or implementations of AI programs in cinema. And this is one of only a few positives the movie offers - positives are few and far between. While, it also does an OK job of representing aspects of our current world within the context of The Matrix.The movie certainly doesn't take itself too seriously. It does not try to be revolutionary and while that could have been a plus, in the end, it plays out negatively. The plot is weak, sterile and unexciting. Its action sequences are poor and barring the casting of Neil Patrick Harris as The Analyst and Toby Onwumere as Seq most of the cast of the movie while talented - seem completely out of place, and uninspired. As if, they were simply - easy and convenient casting choices.Every Matrix movie from the original trilogy was about a world vast and deep, with consequences that carried a whole lot more purpose for everyone linked to that world including its audiences, this movie however is based upon simpler, less interesting, less impactful - terms. There's some sprinkling of profundity within The Matrix Resurrections but throughout the movie it seems to be battling with the depths and grandeur of its past so much that it fails, and cannot realize its purpose. It cannot escape the shadow of its predecessors, it does not separate itself from them, and it ends up being worse off as a result.It tries to do too much and explain too much all in one movie. So much so that this fourth installment alone could be a trilogy of its own, which I think would have helped the story and its characters - but here, everything is rushed and packed into this singular title that just ends up feeling a little ambitious but truly disjointed. While sometimes literally trying to recreate its past.This is probably not only the poorest Matrix movie but also the poorest and most meaningless Wachowski Movie. Perhaps, the point was to kill any hope, idea, or possibility of the franchise having a future. Because this is a lifeless, conventional, and unfortunate disappointment."

Resurrections is easily mistaken for a marvel superhero movie. 2 hours and 28 minutes of unnecessary scenes and boring jokes, which even for me, a big fan of the franchise, got tired of watching the movie halfway through. Yes, it has good points like good special effects, good music and good acting, but that stand out only for the budget of the movie, after all this was the minimum to be given to the fan. Definitely a 5 out of 10."

      "text": "Overall this is very bad and I think it was a mistake to make this.  If we are looking for positives, there are decent special effects and we learn a tiny bit more about the machine world and their motivations.   That\u2019s about where it ends.  Even the first point about the special effects is countered by the fact that the effects in the first Matrix were pretty revolutionary when it came out, but now in 2021 there is really nothing special and in particular the characters look very silly when they are flying.  Next, the endless pointless shooting and fighting scenes in this movie really highlight a fundamental issue with this entire story, which is that it makes no sense for the humans and machines to be fighting in this way.  Both the fights themselves and the reason for the fights are severely lacking.  There\u2019s are dozens of times in this movie when 10+ guys with automatic weapons are unloading on the good guys from feet away and I\u2019m pretty sure no one got hit by a bullet the entire movie.  We are supposed to just accept this because Matrix.  As I watched all these nonsensical scenes it really makes you think, why is this even happening.  In this future dystopia where machines have enslaved the whole human race, why are they even bothering to punch and shoot each other inside the simulation.  It does not appear to be lethal for either side and really just feels pointless and silly.  Next, The dialogue was pretty garbage;  just lots of cliche throwbacks (\u201cI still know Kung fu\u201d are you kidding me!?)  Well I have a lot more thoughts that head into spoiler territory but overall I think this movie was unnecessary and has tarnished the overall quality of the trilogy.  I can\u2019t give it a 1 because I made it through the whole movie but damn it was dumb."

Retreads the same general plot, but with confusing caricatures of the familiar characters and plain parodies of the best scenes from the series. It shows no respect for the material (as absurd as it seems from one of the original creators) or the viewers that hoped for a meaningful expansion of the Matrix universe. The returning actors definitely try their best, but could only do that much with the atrocious material they were given.Shockingly enough, watching it on a dual screening together with the first movie, Resurrections doesn't even look or sound particularly well \u2013 the editing feels chaotic, CGI is mediocre and the soundtrack forgettable. The only way I can explain to myself how this movie happened the way it did is going along with the meta-narrative \u2013 maybe WB really forced Lana Wachowski to make this sequel and it's an act of industrial sabotage. If it was meant to make a laughing stock out of Warner Brothers and make sure to kill off the whole series for the future, that'd be the one thing it very much succeeded with."

I thought this would tell some metaverse story, they would explain something about the real world being a 2nd level of the matrix. They could focus on quantum computing and make the world much broader and deeper, while explaining new sci-fi concepts.First matrix was deeper and more technologically advanced than most viewers. This one is stuck in the past, and is far dumber than most people watching it. This is honestly an embarassment, and im embarassed i have seen it.

The story is god awful, why they\u2019ve decided to dig up the old story and add onto it I have no idea. The fight scenes are like watching your drunk uncle trying to fight other people at the Christmas party, and the portrayal of Morpheus leaves a lot to be desired the same goes for agent smith. These characters were brought to life by the actors and to replace them and to try again just feels lazy and sub par to the originals I didn\u2019t have high hopes but I didn\u2019t think it could be this bad.

I'll tell you how, they edited the film while stoned and laughing at the WB sugar mommas.After all, this movie is the epitome of getting back at Mom and Dad, who raised the spoiled brats who made this.I'm actually embarrassed for the folks that created this cringefest. There must be something truly awful going on in Hollywood when you realize just how poor these people are at story telling.  What was once an admiral art form has really fallen into something lazy and ugly; the politicization and subversion of everything for the sake of the Twitter mob.  The premise of the film was almost interesting but then again, it wasn't executed well at all.  I came into this realizing that the blue haired trans was there to tell some woke diversity story and was willing to look past it, but then everything else happened.  It was quite boring and I turned it off.This thing was cringe and lazy.I'm sure they don't care though.   This was probably not meant to be a real film but a middle finger to anyone who ever worked at making something memorable and creative.

Only instead of the flavor of body sweat this film leaves you thinking you just got a face full of urine. Far more insulting. Barely cohesive enough to function.Its truly a bizarre sight to see a director so oblivious as to why people liked the original source material. Then again it should not really be that shocking. The matrix never actually was about what the real matrix is. If you were online during those days and somewhat knew these hidden stories that are now the lore of the internet and proto dark web, you would know things like The Black Vault. The Matrix document has NOTHING to do with this franchise and it was basically leeching off something much more fringe and dark. So its that sort of drop off and disrespect for the orignial film from the true source material do you see here with this \"film\" from the Original Matrix movie. Basically unrelated. Simply sharing the same name.Dont bother watching unless you want to be underwhelmed, disappointed by a preachy and bloated vanity project."
