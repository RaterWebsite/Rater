And yeah I didnt know that it is Michael Bay's movie, but when seeing it at the end in credits I am not surprised. Basically action is good, but the plot itself a bit stupid and over the top."

All of the character backstories are nicely built up but not overdone.  Then we get to the main mission and it involves the dictator of a fake country, which I just found totally lame and cartoon-like.  Also, they drag out this final act for far too long.  Any political commentary about the evil holding people down is completely toothless because it doesn't have the guts to go after anything real, despite having style that is so over-the-top."

So this is Directed by Michael Bay and after the first ten Minutes, I'm like of course it was. The action is intense the explosions big and the cars are fast. Ryan Reynolds is just playing Deadpool again which seems to be all he can play now. He even does the narrating same as Deadpool. They are trying to replace a Fascist dictator in the Middle East with his brother that is the main plot of this movie."

      "text": "The Netflix movie 6 Underground is about an independent/off-the-radar task force trying to topple a dictator. Though light on substance, this turned out to be a crazily entertaining film.If you've seen Michael Bay's Bad Boys movies, you know the director has no qualms about violence, but here he kicks it up to another level. Everything is up at11 out of 10 in this, and Bay makes the most of the R rating. There are some innovative action ideas in this. The movie also looks great. Overall, this is one of those Bay films where he leans into his best qualities and mostly avoids his worse. It doesn't hurt that this is written by Deadpool and Zombieland writers Rett Rheese and Paul Wernick.Also being a Bay film, the plot isn't as strong as the action. It's pretty hard to believe the characters are able to stay off-the-grid as many of them exercise very little discretion throughout the film. Still, the plot is decent, not to mention the characters and villain. Admittedly the movie does lean into the character of Three (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo) either making too many jokes or stupid decisions. Still, he does have his moments. I went into this without a lot of expectations and was surprised. Recommended."

It's definitely waaaay better than any Transformers movie, but it is still abundant with all the dumb elements you expect from a Michael Bay movie.The Plot: 6 people form a vigilante group to take out bad guys because they don't believe that the legal process will bring justice. They follow a billionaire who wants to bring down a dictator by replacing him with his liberal brother. What are the odds...They do this by screaming out of place lines during action scenes, making jokes all the time, and shooting people that result in slow-motion shots of bullets piercing faces. The action is over the top, but nonetheless amusing.It's dumb, there's no way around it. The characters are cliche's, the violence is so gruesome that is doesn't look realistic anymore, and there are lots of explosions. And in end, it was actually just okay. I give it a 6/10."

The script / dialogue are pretty bad, the story is all over the place with flashbacks, and the general directing is pretty poor. Every scene is spliced together with 20 or more takes, which becomes all too apparent anytime the characters try to hold a conversation, it's jarring how many cuts a scene of dialogue has. It's quintessential Michael Bay."

Ryan Reynolds proves once again his whole repertoire consist of one character that he can \"act\". If you seen any of his past movies you know what I mean. The effects are pretty good but that's the only redeeming quality this movie has going for it. The team the movie revolves around is about as stereotypical as it gets, and I couldn't care less about any of them. I have no idea what happened in the last 40-45min because by then i had already completely lost interest and shifted my focus elsewhere."

      "text": "The two universal truths to this movie: 1) The opening sequence is vintage Bay at his best, and 2) The storyline is it's weak point. The latter would not be a problem, and indeed it doesn't render the Bay-esque 10-angle-action-shots/second opening sequences futile. However, the first Act writes cheques about the expectations of the rest of the movie that the remainder of the movie sadly can't cash. It almost does the job of being the genesis of Bay's answer to the Fast & Furious / Mission:Impossible franchise, albeit the wonderfully ridiculous over-the-top version, under the cover of Reynolds' idiosyncratic humour. Alas, the aforementioned weak plot is not only found wanting, but also wasting the opportunity of what could've been the start of something everlasting, if even a fun and exciting stand alone movie in its own right....this review would be longer but I'm still having to concentrate on the never-ending action scenes that are still somehow not over despite finishing the movie hours ago."

Honestly thought it was written/directed by the same people at first but turns out it's Michael Bay. When he's not involved with Transformers or TMNT he can do some neat things (The Island was pretty good). Starts out way too jumpy for my taste but it quickly comes around. It's a fast paced, highly stylized action movie with lots of irreverant humor. Characters are one-dimensional and the actual plot is rather uninspired but nothing wrong with that from time to time. Refreshing to have a movie that focuses on style and sequence over substance once in a while. The film largely boils down to 3 or 4 lengthy (but exciting the whole time) action scenes and I am ok with that. Great for what it is. Don't watch it expecting Oscar-worthy material unless the Oscars is going to start recognizing stunt doubles and stunt coordinators and things like that."

It is a pretty explosive, violent movie. But damn the humor was pretty low. I laughed maybe once through this movie.The plot is... well pretty mediocre. The start of this movie (that probably burned half the budget alone) tries to establish a background by jumping back and forth to get some sense of character development which turns the movie into a mess. Michael Bay has no clue on establishing back stories. But half way in it lets go and gets on with the story that is not much to get smart about.The acting is OK but that's it. Reynolds is barely holding up this movie to be enjoyable.  But the movie is typical Bay over-the-top production and bad humor lines.And btw, who moors a yatch with an anchor if you are docksided?"
