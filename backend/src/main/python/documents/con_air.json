      "text": "When it comes to action films you can't really go wrong. There are several films out there were turning out to be good or bad or okay or a bit of both. They're not guilty pleasures unless they're considered to be cheesy. In everybody's eyes when they think about it, it stars Nicolas Cage, John Cusack, John Malkovich and many other actors. The result in John Malkovich puts it best: \"Welcome to Con Air.\" Oh yes! This is one of the most ridiculous over-the-top action flicks but in most parts they really love it and doesn't care. Well, I'm on the other hand had seen it and you know what, I like it. It's not a perfect film in anybody's opinions they still enjoy it. Nicolas Cage is Cameron Poe, an Honorably discharged Army Ranger is been sent to prison for manslaughter after killing a drunken man and his three men who tried to attack him. He befriends with Mike O'Dell aka \"Baby-O\". He's been paroled and takes a flight to Alabama on board. U.S. Marshal Vince Larkin played by John Cusack who is approached by DEA agents Duncan Malloy and Willie Sims. Cameron and the other prisoners are on flight and now it's been hi-jacked by John Malkovich's character, Cyrus Grissom aka Cyrus \"The Virus\". Now I went into this movie thinking I'm gonna look upon it and no, there's nothing much apart from the action. It just takes place on the plane at Alabama. I looked up parts of it and what I find is those lines that I can't get out of my head. The first of which is \"Put... the bunny... back... in the box.\" \"Why couldn't you put the bunny back in the box.\" and \"DON'T. TREAT. WOMEN. LIKE. THAT!\" And there is one part that I found stupid is that when a dead body who is actually Pinball played by Dave Chappelle thrown off the plane with a message sent by Poe to the U.S. Marshals and landed on the car with people in it. That scene looks like I'm watching a commercial even thought kids love watching commercials. I just find it silly. \"I like Pinball.\" And before that, I just found a song that I think I listen to when I was a little kid and that was \"How Do I Live\" by Trisha Yearwood and I think there's another song which sounds like that with LeAnn Rimes but I am thinking about that, I'm thinking the Trisha Yearwood version, the version that I always love. I listened to this song every time I'm in the mood cause when I was a kid I'm into 90's songs and in recent years I did not know this song is from Con Air, so that might've been a coincidance. But what's really strange is that this song is been nominated for both an Academy Award for Best Original Song and an Razzie Award for Worst Original Song. How does that make any sense? I think I do believe that this is not the first time that I've ever come across a movie that has been nominated for both Academy Award and the Razzie Award and with this song I have no idea. So as I like Con Air if people were interested in this will know that it's over-the-top and silly however they might love the silliness already. Some people love it are fans of it and some people hate it saying that it's silly and stupid or even as I said already they enjoyed the silliness, it just doesn't matter. I think somebody puts it best: \"Con Air won't win any awards for believability \u2013 and all involved seem cheerfully aware of it, making some of this blockbuster action outing's biggest flaws fairly easy to forgive.\" \"Well, hooray for the sounds of f**king silence!\""

Con Air doesn't just ask the viewer to check logic at the door but throw it out altogether and I must say, as soon as I did it became a film so sure of what it was doing I admired it, then I enjoyed it. Con Air tells the story (story being used loosely) of Cameron Poe a retired Army Ranger who gets in a drunken brawl and accidentally kills a man. He is sent away for 7-10 years, even missing his daughters birth. The film's main action however takes place on his flight to the free world as he is being transferred to his original prison for release. However they just so happened to (if you didn't think this plot was bizarre you will now) be flying him by high security plane with some seriously dangerous folk on board.Poe (Nick Cage) tries his best to get his friends through the flight but considering his best friend is diabetic (I couldn't make this up if I tried). The film goes on with a fast pace with a entertaining yet repetitive score backing up the action. Its a sound action film to watch if you are bored, if only to see John Cusack as something other than a mopey heartbroken teenager."

      "text": "This film is slightly based on true air travels made to transfer convicted criminals. I think I don't need to say that the idea of \u200b\u200ba plane full of chains and bars, with criminals traveling like caged beasts, is pure fiction. Despite having a good cast and some regular action scenes, this film has a very poor quality. The script, written by Scott Rosenberg, is too unrealistic and implausible, starting with the totally stupid idea to fill a plane with crazy killers (one wearing a mask out of \"Silence of the Lambs\"), side by side with an arsenal of light weapons and fatty policeman full of donuts. This scenario could only end badly, making the hijacking too predictable. I don't understand how the police had so much difficulty in tracking the airplane with so many locators and covert surveillance devices available in that days, on the service of the writers and the director, Simon West. Starting from there, the film only gets worse, with a huge circus of unlikely and unbelievable scenes. The end is worthy of the Razzie Award that this film won.The film has a good cast led by Nicolas Cage, John Malkovich and John Cusack. Also participating, among others, Ving Rhames, Steve Buscemi, Danny Trejo, Renoly Santiago and Dave Chappelle. Nevertheless, none of the characters was particularly interesting with the exception of John Malkovich, who gave his Cyrus all the required malice and wickedness without allowing himself to explore a little more his evil. Some of the characters tries, mainly through dialogue, rehearse a few moments of humor, but it's a shot that backfired. The action scenes are truly impressive, but most merely to show-off, being clogged with special effects and sound. For posterity remains a regular action movie, able to entertain, which seeks to impress but ends up leaving us a bitter taste, like a good wine that was too long exposed to air."

Nicolas Cage just wants to see his kid so stops the badguys with the help of John Cusack using constant communication and saves the day.
