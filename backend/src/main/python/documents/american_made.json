Al is straight in Carlito but he's a former drug procurer and seller. Clint drops the drugs for survival and to aid his estranged family. The best ending out of all these movies is Goodfellas, the movies end on a positive note. The rest of the films have negative, disjointed endings that are lacking.

The movie took great liberties but there was a lot to pack in a two hour film. Its moderately fun, the action scenes are well choreographed and Tom is ...well, he is just Tom !

TOM CRUISE is doing TOM CRUISE as only TOM CRUISE does best. See TOM CRUISE fly all over the world in a whirlwind of guns, money and charisma. A very fast paced and entertaining story, wasting absolutely no time from the get go. So if you find yourself stuck for this week\u2019s movie fix well look no further.

Yes, it may contain many tropes previously explored in other films of this nature, but it still had enough wit, humor, and energy about it that kept it all pretty worthwhile for me. Overall, it stands out as one of the smarter and wittier films of Cruise's in a while, which is definitely a fresh relief from his horrible misfire that was 'The Mummy' reboot this past Summer."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Tom Cruise is good but the true story is predictable and nothing particularly fresh with distracting photography and overly stylistic editing to make it fresh in an all too common attempt to be hip and energetic that along with the over use of profanity only wind up hampering the somewhat compelling subject."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "One of the best Tom Cruise movies in years and it passed incredibly unnoticed. It has style and an excellent rhythm, it gets lost in moments but it's a minor problem that is fixed by Cruise's work and with the ease with which he prints that cocky attitude to his character.The interesting thing is that it touches an issue already known of the US government and repeats the formula in which the CIA missions to destabilize governments in real life is always denied and some twenty or thirty years later end up being stories worthy of movies."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "The whole movie was so vibrant, it was smelling of that awesome 80's style. The actors did an amazing performance, Tom Cruise did dominate the hole movie, with his charismatic personality, because he basically was in his element, and you can see that he delivered. Directing methods where pretty basic, and the director knew exactly when he had to use 3rd person and shaky cam. The script was perfect, didn't drag at all, and the humor was great and the seriousness as well. Visual effects where great because they did everything practical, 2 pilots even given they lives to this movie, because they just wanted it to look amazingly realistic. Sound effects where just on point as well. There where no pacing issue the whole movie was very eventful. The plot was pretty messed up, but that is what made it interesting and entertaining. Because it was based on real story it could play with the details, to make it look more fun for the big screen, and I think they did a great job at that.Overall this movie is a very good movie, in short a very entertaining and fun movie about a pilot's life who was very clever."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "In recent years, there seems to be a run of somewhat comical biopics with a frat bro edge to them in the aftermath of The Wolf of Wall Street. Films such as this one, The Big Short, and War Dogs, certainly seem to check similar boxes in showing their protagonists do horrible things. Yet, in finding comedy in the absurdity of what their protagonists did, the underlying cover-ups and corruption at hand, and the sheer insanity of the coke-fueled antics ongoing in the film, it is hard to define these as anything less than greatly entertaining. In fitting squarely into this sub-genre, American Made certainly limits itself to some degree. Consistently coming back to pointing out how crazy everything that goes on is with director Doug Liman winking and nudging the viewer every few seconds and saying, \"Look at this **** Ain't this just wild?\", the film does become rather tiresome. In saying that, American Made is a film that features one of Tom Cruise's very best performances and is greatly entertaining cinema, even if that bit is incredibly fleeting.Set in the late-1970s and early-1980s, American Made details the exploits of pilot Barry Seal (Tom Cruise) and his work for the CIA and the White House. Initially just taking photos of communists in Central America before graduating to being a bag man in Panama, arming the Contras in Nicaragua, and later delivering cocaine for the Medellin Cartel in Colombia, Seal's journey is one that goes right up to the top under the direction of Ronald Reagan. While Liman may not necessarily do the material justice and even with many embellishments along the way, it is hard to say that the story is not the film's greatest asset. At all times, this absurd and comical true story is one so crazy that it has to be true. In detailing the government's involvement in Central America, the lack of organization with the Contras, and the rise of the Medellin Cartel, American Made may not be revelatory or original, but it works all the same. The reason why the film winds up being so entertaining, thrilling, endearing, and engaging, is because of how compelling its story is with a great political kick and cover-up angle to add solid intrigue to the film.In telling this story, Liman does a great job in doing two major things: creating the right look and feel for his throwback 1980s notalgia appeals and making the documentary-style work. For the former, the grainy footage, music, cocaine, and old school photos, all combine to giving the film the right free-wheeling and drug-induced atmosphere to really sell itself. In telling a story littered with horrific human beings, it is imperative that American Made nonetheless make itself entertaining and show the short-sighted appeal of their lifestyles. With the frenetic fun and lavishly extravagant lifestyle led by Barry Seal, it is hard to not get swept up in the chaos and fall in love with the way the film tells its story through this misguided guise of nostalgia.For the latter, the film's documentary style is one that plays perfectly into the style that Liman once displayed in the first Bourne film. Heavy on close-ups, handheld camera, and even some shaky cam, this blend of found footage and docu-style gives the film a greatly frenetic feeling that makes every shot kinetic. Everything seems to be colliding and rushing forward in this film with every shot adding fuel to the fire. Matching the manic nature of Seal's lifestyle, his rapid rise to the top, and quick fall to rock bottom, the film's style is one of its greatest appeals. With Tom Cruise bringing great energy and earnestness to the picture in the lead role, the film's frantic and deeply charismatic display of the life of this man making runs for the CIA and White House turns into a film that seems to have pushed the gas pedal through the floor. There is hardly time to breathe with American Made acting as a whirlwind of pepped up energy.With Cruise dominating in the lead role, it is no surprise that American Made is incredibly watchable as Cruise often makes his films just that when he is on his game. He certainly is here alongside a solid performance from Sarah Wright as his wife Lucy, a strong and unexpected appearance from Jesse Plemons as the Sheriff in Mena, and Caleb Landry Jones as Lucy's dimwitted brother JB. All three give the film great spark in supporting roles, especially Jones' deeply stupid and redneck character that acts as a parasite in the Seal household. However, where the film does slack in the acting department is Domhnall Gleeson. As I will later touch on, American Made's greatest issue is its tone and this is a problem that Gleeson never really helps. Always awkwardly being introduced, seeming uncertain of how serious or comedic his lines should be, and playing like a character cut from an entirely different film, Gleeson gives a performance that is far below his usual standards. Unlike Cruise, he never elevates the material. Instead, he plays right"}, {"rating": "1", "text": "Not to burst any bubbles, but most of this film is fictionalized. Which is a pity, as the real life story is far more interesting. Unfortunate. Not certain why that didn't interest Hollywood."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "It's rather surprising that 'American Made' isn't a particularly good movie given the combination of its subject matter, star, and director.The story is based on the life of Barry Seal, TWA pilot turned drug and gun runner for the CIA in what would eventually be known as the Iran-Contra Affair.  Tom Cruise has both the right kind of moxie and manic energy to step into Barry's shoes, but these days it's getting harder and harder to distinguish where Cruise's own personality ends and that of his myriad action characters begin.  Most surprisingly of all is director Doug Liman's inability to turn this film into a hit.  After all, he certainly has the directing chops, most notably helming 2014's Edge of Tomorrow--also starring Cruise--in what many consider to be one of the best movies of that year and one of the most overlooked films in recent memory.Instead, 'American Made' features numerous shots of actors faces out of frame, an over-reliance on the shaky camera effect, and too much exposition.  Though the movie could have certainly turned into a complete disaster if left in less experienced hands, in the end it simply feels like a lower quality facsimile of the movie 'Blow.'"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "\u201cAmerican Made\u201d shows that even at 55 Tom Cruise, in spite of a few lines under the eyes, still has that contagious smile, only equaled by Julia Roberts, the firm buns that he flashes a couple of times and the infectiousness of his enjoying what he does.\u201cAmerican Made\u201d is a \u2018based on a true story\u2019 film about a pilot Barry Seal, who I had never heard of, that seems to have been quite the wheeler-dealer not only with the CIA and the DEA but the drug lords of Latin and South America plus delivering guns to the Contras among others.The movie is an easy going, thoroughly enjoyable caper story written by Gary Spinelli and directed at a fast pace by Doug Liman.

Et c'est \u00e0 chier.Tr\u00e8s regrettable, car le sujet en lui-m\u00eame est compl\u00e8tement dingue (la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 d\u00e9passe la fiction...) mais massacr\u00e9 et foutu en l'air par le metteur en sc\u00e8ne, l'acteur imb\u00e9cile et l'approche... trop cool ! alors que franchement, il n'y a vraiment pas de quoi \u00eatre hilare, n'est-ce-pas Barry ?"}, {"rating": "6", "text": "\u0421\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0430 \u0441 \u0443\u043e\u043b\u043b \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0442, \u043d\u043e \u0432\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u0445\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u044b. \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0446\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430 \u0432 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043f\u0435 \u043e\u0436\u0438\u0434\u0430\u0435\u043c\u0430\u044f. \u0421\u043d\u044f\u0442\u043e \u0432 \u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043e\u0442 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u044f. \u041d\u0435\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0439 \u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c. \u041f\u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044c 1 \u0440\u0430\u0437 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Following the success of Edge of Tomorrow, Tom Cruise is at his best!

In the beginning, it was a bit chaotic with all the characters they needed to introduce. In 5 minutes of film, they introduced 10 people, which was very much to take in. Some characters got introduced, but later in the story they weren't important at all. Then you ask yourself if it was even necessary to introduce those characters. It manages to establish a bond with Tom Cruises character. The story was smart, but i tell you, very chaotic. I think halfway through the movie, the screenplay writers lost their focus and lost the whole point of the story.I know it's based on real events, so it's crazy that all of that happened."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "If you want to watch a movie and is fun watch then you'd do a lot worse than watching this. It's got some snappy scripting, and the characters are generally likable. (Casting on the red neck brother in law is spot on! haha).
