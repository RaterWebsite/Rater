I wasn't expecting much when I went ahead and watched it but actually liked it almost as much as the first Underworld and definitely better than the second in the series. Any fan of this genre should at least see it once just for the epic werewolf (what seems like 1000 werewolves) stampede."

      "text": "I'm very disappointed at Underworld: Rise of the Lycans. The script is just not looking too good and I was feeling emptied on why Kate Beckinsale didn't return as the sexy vampire hunter, Seline. I thought the series were going to be dead on arrival, but thanks to her comeback in Awakening, I feel like I'm in heaven for more of that wickedly kick-ass moves and killing more vampires. Nothing new for Lycans, however, Martin Sheen's performance look pretty good, I might say. So in conclusion, Rise of the Lycans, rather safe than sorry, but this is one of the worst sequels in the Underworld series."

      "text": "While nowhere near as bad as the 2nd installment of the Underworld series it is still a toothless, soul sucking experience. The change in setting and time period actually help with the return of menacingly good villain Bill Nighy. The loss of Kate Beckinsale can only be seen as a positive (although she does bookend the film) with a prequel story which knows how to have fun. Rise of the Lycans doesn't take itself seriously which is one of the main reasons its enjoyable. However they have gone from one wooden female lead to another with Rhona Mitra's Sonja being just as useless and tiresome as Beckinsale's Selene. While bringing back Michael Sheen and making it an origins story does add a certain gravitas, it fails to wow or at least entertain mainly due to its clearly reduced budget, wooden female lead and depressingly bleak design. Not awful but nowhere near great."

You got to learn a lot more about the history and, as the title says, the Rise of the Lycans who turn on their Vampire owners. Beckinsale is absent but is replaced by the equally as stunning Rhona Mitra, and its also great to see Michael Sheen back playing a more likable Lucian. Overall an enjoyable film and fans will be pleased"

The film is about the beginning of the feud between vampires and Lycans Lucian came when he decided to rebel against the tyranny of vampires. The film is the prequel to the first two and could also be considered the best in the Underworld saga. With a great cast, dark atmosphere, great fights and good special effects, the film manages to entertain the audience well and never bored."

The era in which it takes place, the story behind the entire UW realm makes this 3rd installment one of the best in the series. UW, was great. U:E was so so. U:RotL rises above the others (including U:A). The acting by Bill Nighy is just amazing, to his character. In most scenes.. There was something to focus on. In Viktors (Bill Nighys), I couldn't overt my eyes from his character for nothing. Those gazing stares, that amazing accent and the over-all UMF he puts in every one of his scenes, was simply awesome. Micheal Sheen held the second best character of Lucian. His acting was flawless as well. You could really tell he put his heart into it, as well as Bill Nighy. Both set the stage for an awesome flick for those die-hard fans of the UW saga. And last but not the least, Rhona Mitra as Sonja was great. She held the character well and did her part to make this an epic addition to the UW series. A must watch and definite see on Blu-Ray!"

It's a really good prequel to the series, and is definitively recommended to watch. It's maybe not the best movie out there, but it deserves at least 70/100. I mean, c'mon.

I have read some of the views from some of you & my question is, \"If you're such fans of the Underworld series why didn't you get board with the movie???\" I was reading someones comment saying that it asnwered a lot of questions. What kind of questions did it asnwer cause the frist movie told this entire story!!! This movie didn't even go with the first movie!!! It was like it was it's own story not a continuation of the first or second movie. I kept sitting there saying when are we going to get past all of this & jump to the future. It told the majority of the story the same as they told it in the first movie until they got to the end. The way they killed them (lucian & sonya)was different from the first movie cause they had an audiance before but not in this movie & also lucian was supposed to have thought dead (in the first movie viktor thought lucian was dead) not Viktor. So to me the thought of the rise of the lycans would have been the present day lycans comming back agaisnt the vampires & that is how the new daughter of viktor makes her way back to the vampire family since she is an outcast now, There is so much more I was looking for withthis movie but not a story that I already know. It was a good movie for someone that had not seen the first movie cause action wise it is good. But for a huge fan of the first Underworld movie this was a waste of my money. I could have waited till it hit the dollar movie theater or even video."

(-1)\r - Also, thought that Sonya's death was pretty underwhelming. Not saying I want a gore porn, but I think her prolonged suffering shown viscerally is necessary in these types of films. She cried a bit and then \"oh, wait, she's dead already?\". I might just be kind of a **** up person."

      "text": "So what is this? Another sequel to Underworld after Underworld: Evolution? No, actually. It's actually a prequel, with no Kate Beckinsale as Selene! But how is that possible? Well, it's because it's an origin story that is taken place before Selene is hunting for Lycans. Many centuries ago a werewolf battle known as Lycans are at war before Selene was born. And one vampire elder named Viktor had a daughter named Sonja and one adopted son named Lucian. Lucian escapes Viktor's fortress but is being whipped and imprisoned. And Viktor knows all about him and Sonja. Now Lucian has to go and rescue Sonja from Viktor and Lucian and the Lycans are at battle. Yeah, I can see why this is taken place and I can see why this is a prequel. Lucian is actually a bad guy in the first film and Tannis from the second film is the one who help Selene and Michael. Now then, I actually like this one because I kind of liked the idea of where it has sword fights against werewolves and castle fortresses. Don't get me wrong, I did like the Underworld fine despite it's pretnetiousness and I actually think that Underworld and Rise of the Lycans are better than each other now that is saying much. Underworld: Rise of the Lycans is an obscure film to a certain extent much like Underworld. Now that I've got that decent prequel film out of the way I am now ready to do a sequel with Kate Beckinsale returning as Selene. Stay tuned for that!"

The films have been a combination of soap opera-like drama and over the top borderline absurd action, but for the most part they were \"fun\". Rise of the Lycans is probably the better film of the series...while the 2nd film was the most polished of the 3, this one has the most \"oomph\" behind it. The action seems a bit bigger and borderline epic...given the material, but it still comes off a bit flat. It tells the story of a Lycan (Lucean is his name, I believe) and how he rose from being a slave to the vampires, to a sort of leader. He dosen't really hate the vampires..at first...just tolerates them, but when its exposed that he is having secret \"meetings\" with one particular female vampire...well...the worst happens, and he quickly becomes veangful and hate-filled. The action is over the top, which is to be expected...the FX are nice one minute and Nintendo 64 graphics the next, which is ALSO to be expected...overall...entertaining as an action film. I've always hated the use of color...these films are like \"Visual Sleeping Medication\"...the use of blacks and blues makes my eye-lids heavy, but its the \"mood\" of these films. In the end...its a worth a look if youre a fan of the series and a buy for the more hardcore. I had my fun with this film...but its nothing im gonna plunk the money down for.

This also puts a completely new approach on the series will make you actually think about which side you want to win the war. Normaly in movies like this there are the bad guys and the good guys but this with this movie thats just not the case. It is more realistic in the sence of both sides having there rights and there wrongs because in real life people are rarely completely bad and never completely good. So in the end it will just come down to your own opinion. Assuming you saw the first two. But this isn't a bad place to start if you haven't or if you have no other way of watching the others. This one was alot more emotional that the others. Big time. I won't give anything away but by the time your done watching the movie you will definitely notice that. It was good and I'm glad I went to see it. It was worth it. I also liked Rhona Mitra's charicter way more than Kate Beckensale's because it was a ton deeper.

However we all knew very well, at least should have known, long before the movie came out in theaters, that it is in fact a prequel. You don't have to be a fan of Underwolds to know that \"Rise of Lycans\" would probably be about the times when warewolves had to rebel against the vampires. Of course when opressed, when else woudl they?! Good job, awsome movie. P.S.: Someone had a good point, but Where in the first two of Underworlds did Viktor say or think that Lycan was dead?!"
