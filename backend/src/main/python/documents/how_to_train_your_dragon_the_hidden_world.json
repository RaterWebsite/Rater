The way it wraps up the story of Hiccup and Toothless and Berk as a whole was masterfully done and leaves you satisfied instead of pondering ways that future installments can be made. I really, really, really hope this wins the next animated feature oscar! Sure, Toy Story 4 is brilliant, but I like this better!"

      "text": "As a HTTYD fan since 2017, and someone who loves the series, I can say that I believe in all honesty that The Hidden World is not just the worst of the trilogy, but probably the worst Animated Movie in the last few years. The plot is borderline incomprehensible at points, the characters don't feel alive but more like puppets of the plot, and the dragon flirting scenes drag on for too long (pun intended), the villain is a total idiot who only succeeds based on luck and the main character's being stupider than they ever were in the previous two, and a forced \"Humans don't deserve Dragons, Humans are bad and you should feel bad cause your bad just for being Human. Bye bye Dragons\" message at the end.Hiccup has gone from someone who always does the right thing, who doesn't give up easily (or at all) to someone who would rather run from their problems and give up on trying to make peace with Dragons work (even though it was already working for SIX YEARS up to that point). Toothless has gone from a fiercely loyal, lovable in the \"he's just as much a dork as Hiccup\" and also that factor of \"I want respect\" and been turned into less of a dragon and more of a dog which wants to f##k and nothing else. As someone who's favorite character is HTTYD1 and 2 Toothless, seeing this version of 'Toothless' made me wonder when they'd actually bring THW out and stop showing us this fake. Also, suddenly this Toothless is now the King of All Dragons just so Dean can say it was responsibility that tore them apart, not Toothless wanting to f##k.Grimmel's plans only work because of stupid f##k-ups which characters previously wouldn't have made or pure dumb luck. The Light Fury was just sitting in the forest unchained, if she had woken up earlier and flown off, Grimmel's plan to \"lure Toothless away\" would've been dead in the water. If Toothless and the Light Fury had gone to the Hidden World (which isn't very hidden, being a gigantic **** hole in the ocean) and not come back then Grimmel's plan would've been derailed. If Ruffnut had looked back at all on the flight to New Berk or Ruffnut had not been left behind in the first place, Grimmel would've taken much longer if not never have been able to find the Berkians.And now let's talk about the Light Fury. I hate her, she is a plank of wood sprayed with a white variant of Flint Lockwood's Spray On Shoes. She has zero personality to speak of, and the only reason she exists is to tear Hiccup and Toothless apart so Dean doesn't have to make a fourth movie, also so Dean can push his message of \"Humans bad agghh\"The Riders act like bumbling idiots in this movie, now somehow unable to work without their dragons even though the last act of HTTYD2 literally had them working together, WITHOUT DRAGONS, to distract the Alpha. Valka has zero to no relevance to the story or Hiccup's character besides one scene. If you were hoping to get more of Valka and how she and Hiccup interact, you'll be majorly disappointed.Berk in this movie has been transformed into a seizure inducing sensory overload hell, I would rather drink boiling water than look at this movie's Berk for more than a few hours. New Berk is the most geographically impossible location I've ever seen, and the actual Hidden World is literally a underground cage just dressed up to look like some fantastical world, when it reality it isn't.Also the forced separation at the end is only so Dean doesn't have to make sequels. Dragons aren't safe? They literally just DECIMATED the Hunter Fleet with little to no difficulty, and compared to Drago, they didn't even loose anyone or suffer any injuries. Dragons don't belong with Humans? What about the last 6 years where the Dragons were PERFECTLY FINE on Berk?I could go on and on but I see no point to do so. To cut it short, I'd rather watch paint dry than watch this movie, it'd be more entertaining and less painful. Don't watch The Hidden World.0/10, would rather slam a rock on my foot than watch again."

      "text": "First of all, this is just something I wanted to talk about and that\u2019s Toothless and how he\u2019s just so cute and innocent. Every scene that he\u2019s in he just steals it. If they made a solo Toothless film, which please don\u2019t, I would see it. Since the very first film that came out in 2010 the animation in this film series has just constantly been getting better and better from each entry and in my opinion this one probably had the best animation. Whenever you saw water it looked like real water, all the buildings had the look and texture of real ones. Even the people looked somewhat like real people. All the colour in this film is vibrant and bright that it helps bring you into this world. Also, the lighting in this film helped with what you should feel in that scene. If it was more bright and colourful you knew that it was a happy scene compared to a dark and grim look that would represent a sad moment in it. The characters in this film felt real because they had flaws and made mistakes. Since the first movie to now you see all of these characters grow up over these films and it\u2019s great to see them all mature into these grown adults by the end of this film. All of the action scenes in this film were just breathtaking and were probably better than some of the live action fight scenes you see. The camera angles that showed the action no matter and knew where to focus at what point and time was just amazing. Of course, the music in this film, which was done by John Powell, was intense and easy listening to. I can easily see myself listening to it. The message in this film is great and everybody should follow it. I was going to complain about the subplot between Toothless and the Light Fury but then I realized that it had to happen to help with the main plot and so it really wasn\u2019t a subplot. The humour in this film is subtle and doesn\u2019t over power the film. When there is humour it\u2019s placed in an appropriate place. This isn\u2019t a spoiler because it\u2019s in the trailer but one of the funniest scenes is when Toothless is trying to flirt with the Light Fury. I think really my only problem with this film is the villain Grimmel. He just wasn\u2019t a fully developed villain and this could be because they wanted to keep him a mystery but after the last movies great, one they needed to step it up in this film. I highly recommend seeing this film in 3D due to the breathtaking visual effects. In the end, this film was great and is a great wrap up on one of the best trilogies to date. Also, the ending to this film made me actually cry."

And I'm more than happy to say that it did not disappoint! The magic and fantastical elements that made the first two so enjoyable are all here, along with a touching and bittersweet but also fitting ending to go with it. Storywise, I will say it felt a bit rushed in order to get to the great big emotional ending sooner, but the payoff of the ending was worth it and made up for this for the most part. Overall, this was a great send off to a really solid animated trilogy of films that l've come  to consider to be among DreamWorks animation's best works over the years and will likely remain that way for quite some time to come!"

Every character has a solid Arc, every character shines in their own way, and every character makes you care about them IMHO. (your mileage may vary of course.) But even if you have not seen the first two movies you can still come into this and enjoy the ride as is... you will miss some subplots, but you can still enjoy it. The dragons are every bit as real characters as the people. One of my favorite parts is the way Ruffnut... how shall i put this. Confounds the villain.

Of course since it's the end of the entire franchise, we might as well never see anything like this from DreamWorks Animation unless they manage to step up their game from this point on."

Despite being less electrifying, with less intense battle scenes compared to previous films, the film manages to replenish the lack of intensity in conflicts with the addition of Light Fury. His characters remain naive, even after years in the timeline of the film. We missed a great villain, but it wasn't disappointing. Overall, it is beautiful to see a beautiful conclusion at this level. 8.9/10"

      "text": "First, I would like to note that even though this movie is intended for children, it also appeals to the older audiences as well. I have been a fan from the very first movie and fell in love with the relationship between Hiccup and Toothless. It made me reflect on my own relationship with my pet dog. Usually when the first movie is really good and the director decides there needs to be a second, or a third, they sequels are not as good as the first. Unlike most movie series, How to Train Your Dragon 1, 2 and the Hidden World all complement each other equally. From the first movie to the third, you can see a progression of the main character Hiccup as he grows up and learns the ropes of becoming the new chief of Berk but also can see the progression in the other main characters as well. In the Hidden World, the beauty of the world around them just shines through and is honestly jaw dropping. For anyone, the ending of the movie is very touching and heart breaking but for those who have taken the progression from the first to the third movie, like I have, the emotions hit you more. I was impressed with the detail it all went through to create the movie because the writers and animators could have easier made it much more simple yet they jam packed it with mini details."

      "text": "Moving to a new place can feel like your own house got set on fire. Meeting someone who speaks another language can feel like you are talking to a wall. Deciding to shower in the morning instead of the evening can shift your entire sleep routine. Embracing change puts a toll on anyone, myself included. DreamWorks\u2019 attentive conclusion to their popular trilogy presents these challenges and more in an approach that guarantees any child at heart watching How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World will confront transformation greater as a result.The screenplay to this otherwise watchable feature remains too safe by keeping the side characters to one-note comic devices, as was the problem with previous installments to the franchise. While Toothless learning how to court a white female dragon of his own species becomes a sweet scene without dialogue, the na\u00efve bonding still may distance most others who would see this as too little-kiddish. Adults may enjoy the relatively huge clouds that progress into a powerful storm, yet the sudden splendor ultimately remains pretty hollow in its true meaning. Some older viewers may see it all as nothing but a weak tool for empty spectacle to prioritize its claims to help sincere problems. Not all kids would be totally into the experience either, as some could possibly find some of the dragons too scary, especially a couple of sabretooth venom-spitters who go on a rage in their own flames. Stuff like that could make children skip over the message.Speaking of the message, a bland flashback copies The Lion King with an overused theme, \u201chumans shouldn\u2019t exercise authority over the environment,\u201d with little added on to it that other family films have done better in the past. Its catalyst for delivering that theme centers around an unnecessary lazy old villain trope who kills Night Furies when the focus should have stayed on a true, healthy friendship. There\u2019s the strong friendship between Hiccup and his dragon alright, but what about Fishlegs, Snotlout, Ruffnutt, Tuffnutt, and even Astrid? Nothing exploits the clear changes in each of the friends since their first appearances to display their growth\u2026 not even Fishlegs\u2019 new braided moustache. It\u2019s the same problem movies numbers one and two have: the gang is not fully invested to help Hiccup decide what\u2019s best for Berk.Now with the negative aspects out of the way, DreamWorks\u2019 franchise still remains a wonderful investment. Considering our culture wants to build up borders, what a breath of fresh air that the big screen unites nationalities through something unanimously tangible. The Hidden World does so in a way that must be seen only in IMAX as more dragons fly than ever within neon glows, even to the extent of caressing a silent storytelling language! At a smaller scale, the white Night Fury\u2019s slumber within radiant backlights looks pure inside her misty forest. Then she moves catlike before turning invisible: prim, independent, and well mannered.Everyone can understand animals (that includes dragons), a truth exploited to its full potential when some green auroras grace a sky dance to contrast against other larger, uglier, beast designs. The immense range of scale guides Berk\u2019s soft sunrise stretched from one of Earth\u2019s corners to another that looks much stronger after the foggy rescue mission prologue gives a cold aura. To tie it all together into a cohesive unit, the franchise\u2019s usual director adds dramatic flames beneath the magic hour moments to symbolize Hiccup\u2019s fear of being a nobody without his pet.To make things better, the vocal cast puts their best feet forward without any more of those fake-sounding accents! Jay Baruchel improved quite a lot after struggling a little throughout the first two installments; he carries our familiar hero to take on those new responsibilities of being chief to great success.The wonderful continuation off past movies helps our sympathetic capacity, both in the story arcs and the quality of the animation; Toothless\u2019 sand drawing turns out better now because the sand texture moves so realistically thanks to technological wizardry! These filmmakers clearly matured as they present a series finale that sweetens the senses, as if you too grew over the last decade.We all must take on those risky challenges, as do I, being always caught in personal thoughts. So, I recently joined my church\u2019s Spain mission trip as a way to enforce needed growth. In that same way, Hiccup\u2019s sky-riding has done wonders to inspire fans the past nine years\u2014you can do the same, whether raising a son or daughter, a dog, a cat, employees, or a workspace. Then, proper etiquette can be taught and learned to eventually help others expose the hidden."

They continued with that alpha, dragon-king nonsense, despite toothless not having hypnotic powers. They add to its ridiculousness with some magic mind-control venom.They find a hidden undergorund world where magically there's sunligh. And lots of dragons. And apparently they feed on nothing at all. Of course toothless instantly becomes king and the other dragons bow... Even the Alpha from the second movie. Of course all dragons need to hide there, for some reason...Such a steep downhill from the first movie to the third. It was painful to watch. It has no sense or palatable story. Only cheaply constructed sentimentalism (dragons good, humans bad), beast love, and equally cheap human romance.At the end they apparently stayed at a remote unfamiliar island, instead of going home for no reason...Toothless apparently learnt to fix its mechanical tail on its own BTW.Good graphics though."

That music feels like a perfect 80s VHS intro,aside the interesting animation.Onto the review.Ok,so...Now that DreamWorks is owned by Universal,I know what you're thinking. I'll talk worm squat about this movie,then telling you not to go see it. Right?Not this time,dear! (or,at least for 50 or 70% of it?)How To Train Your Dragon 3 is a great movie,and it's chock-full of stuff everyone will enjoy,but it's also a tiring point for DreamWorks\u2019 style of making sequels.But let's get the positives out of the way.I love how the story writes Hiccup. Sure,now he's the \u201calpha\u201d of Berk,but how is he going to handle everything going on and try to make Berk a safe place? The villain is also great. While they steer to the Ethical Villain route (where he thinks he's making good choices,but really,he isn't),they try to make him just as likable as Drago (who is still the better villain of these movies). Hell,with a shot of Grimmel killing a dragon like nothing,you're starting to cook things up nicely. It's visually spectacular,yeah,but also very busy. So many things are going on,and sometimes,it's so chaotic,right from when we see a Busy,Busy Berk.And the score by John Powell is nothing special and really good at the same time. The beginning set the music up for some greatness,but then,it had a balance with Good and Great,aside from the 3rd Act filled to the brim with fantastic choral work. It\u2019s right up there with Lisa Gerrard\u2019s choral work on Gladiator (2000)The relationship between Toothless and the new Light Fury was...Interesting...although it's mostly used for Dragons Schtick.That\u2019s where I say \u201cToo bad this franchise caper feels like DreamWorks getting tired of their traditional Sequel formula\u201d (\u2018Who really am I?\u2019 and \u2018Gee,I wonder where my parents are\u2026\u2019).It\u2019s not DreamWorks\u2019 fault,though,as they make clear in the Screenplay that \u201cSometimes,you\u2019ll need to let go of your beloved one\u201d,polite and good enough for an animated franchise. Believe me,I\u2019m struggling to find other good stuff about this movie.The Screenplay,aside from that gold nugget,feels like Dean DeBlois getting tired of the franchise and writing this as the epic finale,since he understands the franchise finished its gas (something studios like Universal doesn\u2019t want to understand). Hey,at least someone understood this car ran out of fuel.Unlike the first two movies,they try to shoehorn in the secondary characters too. While Gobber,Astrid and Eret (the Jon Snow character) are still hilarious,the kids,on the other hand...Get ready for what are they going to do with it.There\u2019s a romance B-Plot in here that it\u2019s so weird,it\u2019ll make the kissing scene from Venom look like the Church sequence from Kingsman 1.And,once in a while,they just stop the movie to make you look at the visual prettiness,and it\u2019s something I\u2019m kinda starting to despise. I get it,your movie is gorgeous.I don\u2019t know,man,maybe it\u2019s my head telling me \u201cIT\u2019S A UNIVERSAL MOVIE. GIVE IT A NEGATIVE RATING\u201d,but at the same time,I\u2019m battling with the traditional movie critic head against the Universal Virus. That sure as hell felt better than the actual movie.This could\u2019ve been one of the greatest animated trilogies of all-time,but sadly,I can\u2019t say it for how this conclusion turned out to be. But hey,it\u2019s still one of the best trilogies of a book-to-movie adaptation,so a cup of cheers for that ;-D"

      "text": "\"You're supposed to be the generation who lead us into the future.\".( 65/100 ).No hay mucha diferencia entre \u00e9sta y varias otras pel\u00edculas infantiles. How To Train Your Dragon jam\u00e1s fue mi mayor afici\u00f3n y ver la conclusi\u00f3n de esta saga no me fue conmovedor. Sin embargo debo de admitir que hay un par de momentos de gran valor narrativo y emotivo que la salvan de ser totalmente invisible.En esta aventura, Toothless y Hiccup, interpretado por Jay Baruchel, rescatan dragones y los integran a un estilo de vida m\u00e1s seguro. Sin embargo, el espacio en donde habitan ya es muy peque\u00f1o para todos los integrantes y tambi\u00e9n es muy vulnerable de los agresores, por lo tanto, el plan es mudar a la sociedad de dragones y humanos al mundo escondido en donde podr\u00e1n vivir sin confrontaciones.La \u00fanica parte de ingenio que vale la pena rescatar en la narrativa es la forma en la que el amor no se puede sostener sin la amistad. Me hubiera gustado una resoluci\u00f3n en la que el sacrificio y el abandono no se hubiera dado, pero tambi\u00e9n entiendo que es parte de una intenci\u00f3n que har\u00e1 que sobreviva tanto la emoci\u00f3n por la saga como el respeto por la mitolog\u00eda en la que se basa. Visualmente, s\u00ed es un fest\u00edn. Hay una aglomeraci\u00f3n de elementos y detalles que hace que el recorrido asombre con colores, formas, especies, lugares y una que otra secuencia visual que har\u00e1 que el cari\u00f1o de la gente por la saga no desaparezca pronto. Hiccups le ense\u00f1a al p\u00fablico el valor del ser incondicional y la forma en la que eso crea amistades y relaciones tan fuertes, humildes y transparentes que la distancia, cuando es la soluci\u00f3n, no es un obst\u00e1culo. The Hidden World es una pel\u00edcula carism\u00e1tica que no aspira a nada m\u00e1s que a mostrar un mundo visualmente hermoso y una narrativa f\u00e1cil de digerir cuyas peque\u00f1as vueltas dram\u00e1ticas enganchar\u00e1n a grandes y peque\u00f1os.-There's not much difference between this and many other kids movies. How To Train Your Dragon never was my biggest fondness and seen the conclusion of this saga was not really moving for me. Nevertheless, I will admit that there are a couple of moments with great narrative and emotive value that save it from being completely invisible.In this adventure, Toothless y Hiccup, voiced by Jay Baruchel, rescue and integrate dragons to a much safer life stile. The problem is that the space where they live is too small for all of the members and too vulnerable to attackers, therefore, the plan is to move the human-dragon society to a hidden place in which they will be able to live with no confrontations.The only clever part that is worth saving in the narrative is the way in which love is unsustainable without friendship. I would\u2019ve liked a resolution in which sacrifice and abandonment would not have happened, but I also understand that is all part of the intention to survive both the emotion for the saga and the respect for the mythology in which is based. Visually, it is a feast. There's a jam of elements and details that makes the travel to surprise with colors, forms, species, places and some few visual sequences that will hold the affection of the people to the saga for some long time. Hiccups teaches about the value of being unconditional and the form in which that creates strong, humble and honest enough friendships and relationships that distance, when it is a solution, it's not an obstacle. The Hidden World is a charismatic movie that doesn't aspire to more than a visually beautiful world and an easy to consume narrative with little dramatic turns that will engage kids and grown ups."

It's beautifully animated with lively main characters that have been developed well through the past two films, backed from a top-tier voice cast. The story is also entertaining with the action and flying sequences being as stunning as ever. The only thing hampering this film from being as great as its acclaimed counterparts is the weak, cliche villain, which has seemed to be a problem with all the How to Train Your Dragon movies. In the end, Hidden World closes off Dreamworks' best trilogy yet, even with new parent company Comcast/NBCU at the helm for this one."

      "text": "\u201dHow To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World\u201d should be the equivalent of how every other animated or live-action trilogy should add up to when it reaches the end of their run. It takes the gorgeous 3D animation, the interchangeable characters, the stellar action set pieces, the breathtaking cinematography, the captivating musical scores, the emotional but heart-tugging messages, everything that made its predecessors so adorable, so lovable, so relatable, so reeling in awesomeness, it all carries over here. The only major downside is the fact that despite how good this movie is, despite the fact that it\u2019s one of those rare gems in a trilogy where the third film doesn\u2019t suck, it is still effectively the weakest out of the three. It separates away from the darker and more mature tone that its predecessor set, the two main story arcs that come together seamlessly wrap up to the benefit of one arc as opposed to the other and there was no need for an antagonist here. In a movie this simple but so complex in its execution, you either give its villain the Drago treatment or you don\u2019t wanna include him here PERIOD. Here, it should\u2019ve been the latter.As far as I know though, these stories aren\u2019t exactly very original as far as these movies go but it isn\u2019t so much on what the story is that matters more than it is how it\u2019s executed. It\u2019s how these stories are presented plus the relationships they build plus the journey they take to get to the destination that matters the most and the presentation for how all three of these movies executed it is the very reason why we\u2019ve been able to have so much fun with it for this long. But all things considered, it manages to end this series on a high note, the way it deserves. All good things come to an end......and there\u2019s no denying we\u2019re gonna miss you, Toothless."

Vikings who suddenly become enemies of the crown. Most scenes have no downtime, no breaks. The result is a work of staging particularly well worked. The combat choreographies are nice, but not exceptional. This dragon 3 leaves us less an area of solitude as are predecessor, but on this episode the environments are completed by copy / pasted and it sees that. Beyond that, there remains a nice film powered by his catchy music.Dragon 3 est un bon film mettant en sc\u00e8ne deux Dragons rois devant lib\u00e9rer un peuple opprim\u00e9 pour leur puissance et leurs mani\u00e8res de vivre au milieu des Vikings.
