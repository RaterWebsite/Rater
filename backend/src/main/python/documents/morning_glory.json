This is NOT one of those.  Harrison Ford's character was over the top obnoxious and Rachel McAdams was overly perky and annoying to the point of a bad sitcom.  Diane Keaton was good but she isn't featured all that much.  Very little chemistry between the two romantic leads.  I didn't care about anyone in this film and it simply wasn't very funny."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This was a LOL movie. Rachel McAdams was wonderful. I never realized she had such comedic timing. She was the key to the movie's success. The audience seemed to love every minute of the movie. Go if you want to laugh."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Rachel McAdams is annoying.  Well, I'm sure she's lovely in real life, but her character in this film would not be in your inner circle of friends.  Examples of why not?  Let's see.  She's ridiculously gorgeous but gets flustered when people ask her if she has a husband or boyfriend.  She says \"sorry\" all of the time.  When there is something she cares about and gets animated it comes off as \"I'm so perky!  Listen to me because I'm perky!\"  She is always flustered, is dropping things on the ground, and her face usually has a vaguely incredulous look on it.  Enough examples yet?  Hooray for Harrison Ford and Jeff Goldblum who verbally smack her down like the yappy dog she is playing.  This movie reminds me why I hate morning shows.  At one point, Rachel tells Harrison that there was a war between news and entertainment, and news lost.  So did America.  Shows such as the Today Show, Good Morning America, and the Early Show are just ridiculous.  God forbid Americans learn what happened over night in other countries while brewing their coffee.  Ford's dialogue saves this film from being a total loss.  \"You want me to banter?  Isn't banter from the Latin word meaning to jabber like a moron?\"  Responding to Diane Keaton who says, \"I had to say rectal and moisture in the same sentence\" he retorts with \"Well, first dates can be tricky.\"  These lines are few and far between and do not make up for the rest of this nonsense.\r Thought of some other ways why Rachel's character is annoying.  She bangs her head against various items with an alarming frequency to convey to herself that she is frustrated or embarrassed.  She says \"hi\" at least twice but usually three times when she enters a room.  So much to not recommend this film, but to end on a positive note, Chris Matthews and Morley Safer make cameo appearances."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This movie is a good feeling movie, is interesting, have a good humor, the cast have a great performances, is like this movies that made to hang, are really great case. I love morning glory, is a great movie."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "I almost walked out of the theater 3 times, but I wanted to see the relationship between McAdams and Patrick Wilson fleshed out a bit.  What the hell is going on with Harrison Ford these days?  His \"sensitive\" turn reminded me of his child-like role in Regarding Henry.  Is it just an age thing?  I almost have to rent Working Girl to wash the image of his performance in this movie out of my head."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Contemporary films are edited to death. It's a criticism made over and over again, ad nauseum, by old people with long memories. In Robert Altman's \"The Player\", a security guard grouses to his much younger colleague about how \"everything these days is all cut, cut, cut,\" citing Orson Welles' \"Touch of Evil\", with its long opening shot as a dramatic counterpoint to the chopping speed of modern movies, while they traverse the studio lot. Walter Stuckel(Fred Ward) remembers \"Network\", a filmic augury about the encroaching sensationalizing of broadcast journalism, which \"Morning Glory\" clearly descends from. While the sunny child birthed from Sidney Lumet's loins may have some of 1976's looks, along with 1987's congeniality(James Brooks raised it), \"Morning Glory\" differs in this very important aspect: the news industry's degradation into its current information/entertainment hybrid that both \"Network\" and \"Broadcast News\" prognosticated from their own respective eras were, at the time, still a laughing matter, extrapolative art which bore the habiliments of satire. Concerning the state of the news, \"Morning Glory\" is post-stupid, and has no qualms about it. The devil's minion doesn't carry a pitchfork, but give Becky Fuller(Rachel McAdams) time, and she will, as the producer of \"Daybreak\" helps drag the low-rated morning show to hell without any regard for the hallowed industry's past that she professes to love, all in the name of the bottom line: ratings, and the glory that comes along with the territory, ephemeral as it may be. Becky, a thoroughly modern update of the Faye Dunaway character in \"Network\", is a 24/7 workaholic with little room for a personal life, just like Diana Christensen, the programming chief for the UBS network, but since McAdams' character turns up in a light, breezy comedy, and can light up a room with her megawatt smile, unlike Dunaway's dour, lipsticked shark, the ramifications for the industry that follows Becky's success may not be as readily apparent. It's a crying shame that the tenacious woman settles for being a pawn of the status quo, rather than aim to be a proponent for change, because she's clearly dynamic enough to exact a revolution. Together with Mike Pomeroy(Harrison Ford), a lion in the news biz(cut from the same mode as Walter Cronkite) who takes the \"Daybreak\" gig for the money, Becky could restore news to the news division. And should their best-laid plans fail to procure traction with the general public, at least the producer can say she fought the good fight. Her utter competency, especially her hyper-ability to process information is the film's comic highlight, when Becky proves her mettle during a production meeting on her first day, in which she answers all of her staff's questions with rapid-fire economy, an exhilarating retort to the bombardment of information that seemingly overwhelms her. The MTV-style editing that Walter Stuckel hates is a reflection of her fast mind. More often than not, the camera's reluctance to linger on a subject for any length of time is purely a commercial matter, but in \"Morning Glory\", the conventional editing style is predicated on an adducible tangent; it prevents Becky from getting self-introspective. If this woman-on-the-go stopped for one second and examined the damage that she presides over on a daily basis, as the network news producer(played by Holly Hunter) does in \"Broadcast News\", in which the filmmaker utilizes a long take, time enough for Jane Craig to have a good cry, maybe she would have second thoughts about replacing the show's soporific segments from its prior incarnation with pure spectacle, and listen to Pomeroy's heeding for a return to old school journalism. Since the newsman's cries fall on deaf ears, more or less(the two, however, do reach a compromise that allows for SOME substance in the program), \"Morning Glory\" should have forewent the motions of a romantic comedy(by dropping the needless love interest, as played by Patrick Wilson), and mirrored the May/December romance between Dunaway and William Holden, by pairing up Becky with the older man, as well. Despite the sex, Max never compromised his integrity, as it pertained to his professional life, whereas Mike Pomeroy joins the riffraff, selling himself out through reinvention. Donning an apron for a cooking demonstration, a trusted voice in America's living rooms suddenly becomes a comradely one; he turns into Regis. Worse than Diane Christensen, Becky has a touch of evil that's even more insidious, more far-reaching Diane captured a groin. No biggie. Becky, however, captured a soul."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Being dragged along to this movie by my Fiancee I really didnt expect much!!! The cast seemed good enough, but isnt this the same Ho-hum drum that gets released every week!? Well to my surprise it actually started pretty well, Rachel Mcadams does a good job portraying a perfectionist OCD work freak, but its exhausting just watching her(and quite depressing). The supporting cast is okay, but Harrison Ford is so unlikable in his narcisitic tone that I just didnt find him funny. Diane Keaton plays her same Kooky self and Patrick Wilson the man in her life who is meant to be a 'good' guy, gives off a player/ sleazeball vibe. All in all though the majority of the film does hold firm!! The final 30 minutes however It seems to lose itself in all its contrivences ...I mean come on...\" You do not go for a job interview at NBC and have a tv in front of you showing your rival breakfast show...come on...and your cell phone is on?\"...Please!!! I left this movie feeling sorry for all the characters, and maybe that was the point!!!...actaully...what was the point?"}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Morning Glory suffers from what most 'bad' romantic comedies suffer from: a uninspired, cliched central romance. Two beautiful people who inexplicably can't find love, but do with their fellow 'unlucky in love' beautiful person. Sure, it makes you go 'awww!', but it isn't realistic or interesting in any sense of the words. What elevates Morning Glory past this weakness is the strength of the large cast of small, quirky supporting characters. Harrison Ford and Diane Keaton absolutely shine as old egotistical reporters, and the group of strange managers and writers around them are adorable. Go see this for them."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "\"Its Harmless and really dull , Morning Glory lacks some more likable talent then the film has to offer it has its moments of pure joy , but then slips and falls and never really recovers , not a good choice for Harrison Ford , it lacks in many areas\" ..

Highlights: Ford's deadpan, it's message work can be pleasurable in itself. Lowpoints: Keaton not being put to better use, the romantic sub-plot's utter lack of sexiness."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Rachel McAdams plays a terminally perky producer who gets hired to revitalize the worst-rated morning show on network TV. Her primary battle is with a news legend (Harrison Ford), who hates doing the fluff. McAdams gives the role plenty of pluck, but doesn't have the natural comic charms the role needs. The rest of the cast turns in acceptable performances. The script/direction are energetic and predictable. Overall, it's a mildly appealing trifle."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Morning Glory doesnt really offer anything new, and ends on just being okay. It is just kind of the same old movie we would see around this time of year. It is cute enough to make you smile a little, and can be clever and charming in some parts but this film really under performs and really kind of settled for the absolute least."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "There are some funny moments, but they are few and far between. A lot of the dialogue is laughably bad, and, most egregiously, the musical cues are some of the worst and least subtle in recent memory. McAdams is clearly a talented actress, but her character was insufferable, and she deserves better than this dreck."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Rather disappointing after generally decent reviews for a romantic comedy. Most of the actors were rather fun to watch, especially Harrison Ford, but the romantic sub-plot was poorly placed and directed, so it felt pretty uneven. The comedy only comes in spurts. And it's about a half hour too long."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "This is not the next \"Devil Wears Prada\"  Very similar story of a young ambitious woman trying to find her place in the real world and learning life lessons from bitter old work-a-holics.   Characters aren't as charming and you won't laugh as much.    The cast in Morning Glory is incredible just like the Devil Wears Prada but there is definitely a lack of chemistry in all the relationships presented in this film.  Save this for Netflix."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "There are unquestionably an absurd amount of flaws in \u00e2"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "It has been a long time since I enjoyed a movie this much.

Rachel McAdams did a great job, and frankly I think that this movie is really worth to watch, but that's just my opinion.

You seemed to be the golden thread that tied it all together."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Always nice to see Rachel Mcadams. Not to mention Harrison Ford.

Yes McAdams is unfeasibly chipper and Harrison Ford is overly miserable, but you know what, it had some really funny laugh out loud moments and for that reason alone I'd recommend it to put a glorious smile on anyones face on any given morning!"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Harrison Ford is in truly fine form here, along with everyone else. This film is so perfectly cast.....the players really make the film hard not to like. I found myself at times laughing so hard that tears came to my eyes, and yet there was enormous heart and deeply buried human emotion that fleshes out in this film. McAdams and Ford really hit a strong connection here in sort of a father/daughter sort of way. Keaton is priceless as the happy-go-lucky co-host who just so happens to be \"game\" for anything!

This romantic comedy is definitely above the average."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Morning Glory is a film about a woman who runs a failing morning show and her struggle to bring it back to what it once was. The title is apt not only in the fact it describes what Becky (Rachel Mcadams) is trying to return the show to but it also describes the feel of the film. Its a feel of cheerful possibility as if after the film is over you have the rest of the day to enjoy. Its a film that is undeniably chipper and is all the better for it. In Becky's quest to help the show regain some credibility (and hopefully some ratings) she enlists the help of legendary news anchor Mike Pomeroy (Harrison Ford), a washed up presenter whose career has hit a low point. He begrudgingly accepts a position at Daybreak where his sarcastic wit and his contempt for all things morning show drive people up the wall, especially his co-anchor Colleen (Diane Keaton). The film works Ford for every ounce of sarcasm he has and in doing so infuses some much needed comedy into the proceedings (especially in his interaction with Keaton). Mcadams proves a talented lead (much like she does in The Time Travellers Wife) as her perky demeanour fits the character of Becky whose eternal optimism is entertaining even when it borders on naivety. She and Ford have great chemistry and their scenes towards the end of the film are delightfully heartfelt giving the ending real heart unlike most modern relationship comedies. The cast is rounded out by some equally talented comic actors like Patrick Wilson and John Pankow. Pankow gives a particularly entertaining performance as ever cynical producer Lenny Bergman. The writing is quick and funny while also allowing for some touching moments, specifically between Ford and McAdams with the direction emphasising the light cheerful tone the film is going for. All in all it works really well and if it is let down anywhere it is in its beginning which seems a little too cornball but it soon shakes it off with a good dose of grumpy Ford which everyone loves, even if they don't want to admit it."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "this was an amazing movie wow, there was drama, humour, a roller coaster of emotions and i got to say Rachel McAdams was not only inspirational but simply spectacular in this movie, definitely a must watch movie."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Rachel McAdams shines in the leading role and it does provide laughs but not enough in my opinion. Morning Glory should have been better but the film is still technically a good movie. I give this movie 63%."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Another news-workplace comedy elevated by a strong premise and a spot-on cast. It has Aline Brosh McKenna written all over it--but when you have Diane Keaton and Rachel McAdams attached, it's wonderful."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Light-hearted and enjoyable.

This movie is good in this respect and has been able to have good decoupages in the interior scenes. The behind-the-scenes issues of TV shows or movies and how they are made have always been of interest, and that the movie's script was written very carefully, and the success of the movie is due to its good script and characters, and the actors were good. Good actors were chosen. And they have good games. \u201cHarrison Ford\u201d and \u201cDiane Keaton\u201d and \u201cRachel McAdams\u201d are all three very good, good.
