  "description": "In 1863, Mississippi farmer Newt Knight serves as a medic for the Confederate Army. Opposed to slavery, Knight would rather help the wounded than fight the Union. After his nephew dies in battle, Newt returns home to Jones County to safeguard his family but is soon branded an outlaw deserter. Forced to flee, he finds refuge with a group of runaway slaves hiding out in the swamps. Forging an alliance with the slaves and other farmers, Knight leads a rebellion that would forever change history.",

      "text": "Matthew McConaughey is a powerful actor in a powerful role but \u201cFree State of Jones\u201d is not as powerful a screenplay, by Gary Ross, as it could have, should have been. All the elements are there from the story being based on a not too well known chapter in American history that includes the Civil War, slaves being mistreated by owners, inter-racial lovers, voting rights, KKK attacking, the poor who are fighting the war so the rich can get richer, a band of escaped slaves, a time in the future when a man is put on trial for marrying a white woman because he may be part black and just after that scene the film doesn\u2019t go into the high you would not only expect but want.\r The idea of a band of people calling a section of their State, here the Free State of Jones, and how that is done or would work is passed over just as what the slaves and poor white people have in common enough to unite and go against those in charge.\r Gary Ross, who also directed the film, tries to stick to the facts of history and, in most cases, stays away from over dramatizing those scenes that might have been more moving, for instance the coupling of white, married Newton Knight (Matthew McConaughey) and black slave Rachel (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) who give birth to a son and, due to reversals in fortune, his wife (Keri Russell), along with his first son, comes to live with them.\r McConaughey continues his winning streak of strong characters but here he applies the strength that is only hinted at by the director and writer, while the depth of his relationship with Rachel is helped by the subtle playing of Gugu Mbatha-Raw who, after \u201cBelle\u201d and \u201cBeyond the Lights\u201d should be a huge star. Mahershala Ali, who names himself Moses, starts with a repulsive iron necklace with spears eventually removed by McConaughey, and winds up in one of the most shocking scenes of the film.\r The cast, with many speaking parts, is an honest look at all sexes, ages, social strata most of who made up the armies of the Civil War. The swamp, filmed in Louisiana, provides some breath taking scenes.\r \u201cFree State of Jones\u201d will show many viewers a part of American history not too well known, contains strong performances but at 140 minutes could have been tightened by eliminating the courtroom scenes that take place in the late 1940s making for a tighter, faster moving and, possibly, allowed some room to add emotional scenes as even most of the death moments offer nothing."

But as a result we are looking at critics looking at the film through that lens critiquing based off of the wrong criteria. This film was not about a gripping plot, it was not about the story of a hero, it was not a mere attempt to shift hollywood paradigms on the \"white savior.\" This film is above all else a conversation starter. And it wouldn't be doing its job correctly if it was overdramatized, overwritten, and done in a way that is meant to be digestible for your typical moviegoer. Ross does a spectacular job preserving the integrity and academic nature of the content.\r So for those looking for the next wartime hollywood drama, maybe check out Captain America: Civil War. For those intrigued by the unearthing of a controversial piece of history, I would highly recommend this film.  Not to mention it came paired with a primary source reader that documents and provides footnotes for every scene of the movie. www.freestateofjones.info"

There are parallel stories about his relationships with several slaves and a flash forward to a racially-charged court battle in the 20th century. A lot's going on and even with the deliberate pace, it manages to maintain interest. Writer/director Gary Ross has purposely let this sprawling story take place slowly and took advantage of McConaughey's star power with lots of lingering close-ups. The cast is strong and that helps, but this film is dramatic, solemn and noble\u2026a mighty effort to make important cinema\u2026and it somewhat succeeds. Plus, it's based on a remarkable true story, which makes it more interesting."

Wonderful performances by all the leads and beautiful cinematography that takes you back to what it must have been like in the south.

This was a riveting movie that kept me interested throughout, as it looks at Newton Knight's life as a Confederate deserter, leader of a militia that controlled a portion of Mississippi, and a civil rights supporter during Reconstruction.  It then flashes forward to the miscegenation court case involving his great-grandson in 1948.\r Matthew McConaughey does a terrific job as Knight, and makes us understand his transformation.  Keri Russell, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and the actor portraying Moses also turn in stellar performances.  Yes, there is considerable graphic violence, but it does not seem gratuitous.  The reconstruction part of the film is also quite difficult to watch (and somewhat long).  The film is not at all sympathetic to the Confederate army, particularly the officers, since it is told from Knight's perspective.\r I actually found the flash forward to 1948 to be a valuable part of the film (at times, it was a break from the Civil War/ Reconstruction action).  This film has a lot of interesting things to say about race and class in America, and it should be seen by more people."

If you have no interest in history, you will be bored. If you love studying history as I do, you will be fascinated. At its heart is a very tender love story between two people whose lives have been unforgiving but who find some measure of peace in each other in the midst of the maelstrom of war.\r There are superb performances from Matthew McConaughey, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Mahershala Ali. The audience follows Ali in his journey from runaway slave to insurrectionist warrior to happy family man and political organizer. Keri Russell in a small role breaks your heart. They are all trying, in the words of another Mississippian William Faulkner \"not merely to survive but to prevail\". A film that is deeply affecting and causes the viewer to reevaluate everything you thought you knew about the South during the Civil War."

      "text": "Free State of Jones commits a few key sins, but for me, I really do not care. Yes, it is a bit long. Yes, it does love speeches. Yes, it does cover too much. Yes, interspersing scenes from the future kills the flow of the plot, even if it continues the thematic elements of the film. Yes, it probably does simplify more than a few things. All that said, I still really liked this film.\r As I greatly enjoy history and have long craved a new film about the Civil War, I was just about to accept any drivel to make me truly satisfied. Fortunately, this one fits the bill and is slightly better than drivel. Matthew McConaughey turns in a typically charismatic and cool performance as a man I would follow to the end of the Earth and jump through a brick wall if he told me to. Not even as Newton Knight, either. I would jump off a bridge if McConaughey told me to without regret or shame.\r A sprawling and ambitious attempt to not only cover the story of Newton Knight, but also the period just before and right after the end of the Civil War in the South including topics such as apprenticeship, the rise of the KKK, inter-racial love, voting, literacy, \"emancipation\", and reconstruction. This often untold area of the Civil War is told very well in Free State of Jones, even if its jumping through time a bit is a clunky way of approaching the topics. That said, each scene it does show covers the topics it sets out to cover very well and accomplishes its main goal: to inform. Even better, it not just informs, but it entertains with tense and well-constructed action sequences that capture the look and feel of the Civil War. If nothing else, Gary Ross did his homework and that is truly admirable.\r Though the general plots expansiveness could have been better handled, Ross does a great job balancing his characters. Focusing in one people from different worlds, he does a good job developing the major players, especially Knight (McConaughey), Rachel (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), and Moses (Mahershala Ali). These characters really have good chemistry with one another and are largely well-written.\r The production design and costume design is another major win for Free State of Jones. With shocking attention to detail from the swamps of Mississippi to the battlefield, the film is masterfully crafted. The costume design for the uniforms and clothing is terrific and really impressive with its period detail. This, in addition to the characters, is where the film's bread and butter can really be found. Ross' ability to create well-developed characters and attention to detail is really evident in these two areas and why I found the film to be better than expected.\r On the negative side, Free State of Jones' use of the future case does further its examination of the power of prejudice. I mean, Newton's great-great-great grandson looks white, yet the fact that Newton had a child with Rachel means that he cannot marry the white woman he is in love with. Many took issue with the film supposedly mirroring the struggle of blacks with those of whites, but to me, it is not doing that. Instead, it is showcasing how deep and far this prejudice go. For all intents and purposes his great-great-great grandson is white. Yet, in the chance he any black in him, he must go to jail for trying to marry a white woman. Incredible stuff that shows how deeply hatred runs. Unfortunately, Ross has no idea how to work this into the film and the scenes play far too briefly and with little emotional impact. Instead, they are like blips that break up the rest of the film.\r Overall, Matthew McConaughey is very good in this film destined to be shown in history classes across the nation. An untold story from the Civil War, the story of Newton Knight and Jones County is an inspirational one of fighting for what you believe in. Though it is a bit long and could have been told better, the acting, characters, and production/costume design more than elevate this one in a well told history film. Above all, I am more than willing to accept this film to try and fill my craving for more historically-based films, especially ones from the Civil War."

      "text": "Free State of Jones\" is a moving, authentic, important film. Matthew McConaughey gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Newton Knight, an historic figure. I forgot I was watching Matthew McConaughey and felt that I was watching Newton Knight. I've really never seen a performance quite like McConaughey's here. His Newt Knight is the most manly man in any room \u2013 or swamp \u2013 and yet he is also as tender as a mother.\r In the early Civil War battle scenes, he plays a nurse. Knight is not shown mowing down the enemy with impressive, explosive gunfire. Rather, he is shown risking enemy fire in order to save men's lives, or to retrieve and bury the corpse of a boy shot in battle on his first day. My tears flowed freely during these scenes. Later, Knight himself cries after one of his men is hanged. But Knight gets his revenge, an eye-for-an-eye revenge scene that I won't soon forget.\r Newton Knight was a white Mississippi farmer. He was the grandson of a slaveholder, but Knight owned no slaves himself. He served in the Confederate army, but deserted in 1862, after serving for almost a year. He was outraged by the Twenty Negro Law, that allowed families who owned twenty slaves to exempt one family member from service for every twenty slaves they owned.\r Knight and other deserters formed The Free State of Jones, declaring their loyalty to the Union, and flying the stars and stripes rather than the stars and bars. After the war, Knight worked for Reconstruction and married Rachel, a freed slave woman. His children also married cross-racially. He died in 1922. As might be expected, he is a controversial figure in Mississippi. Fans of the Confederacy denounce him as a traitor. Others celebrate him as one white Southerner who had a conscience and resisted white supremacy.\r Newt Knight was clearly someone with a bucketload of charisma. His power inspired men to fight to the death against their own nation. McConaughey radiates charisma in this role. He is masterful and yet intimate. I'd follow this Newt Knight into battle and feel proud to do so.\r \"Free State of Jones\" is receiving negative reviews. It's easy to see why. There is something in this film to anger multiple grievance mongers.\r First, race hustlers will hate this movie. Race hustlers want the official story to be that all whites are supremacists and all blacks are heroic. A film that depicts a white man who worked for black rights is taboo. Race hustlers anathematized \"Mississippi Burning\" and \"The Help\" for the same reason. Such a shame that the race hustlers' ideological blindfolds make it impossible for them to appreciate great art.\r Liberals might hate this film for a couple of other reasons. I don't know if I've seen a movie where almost every scene hinges on how guns are used. Almost everyone is armed, and uses those weapons to keep breathing and to settle disputes. Even little girls have guns and use them heroically. Second amendment fans may love this film. It depicts what they dream of: oppressed citizenry taking up arms to defeat their own government.\r In addition to clinging to their guns, these rebels cling to their God and their Bibles. This is one of the most religious American films I've seen in a while. It's an historical fact that Newt Knight was a devoutly religious Primitive Baptist \u2013 he didn't drink, for example. The film drives home Knight's Christianity. He is shown in a long scene using a quill to record a birth in his Bible. In one heartbreaking scene, a slave who has been sexually molested survives psychologically by reciting verses from Genesis. \"Free State of Jones\" practices a muscular Christianity. One eye-for-an-eye scene takes place in a church.\r Republicans will be torn about \"Free State of Jones.\" On the one hand, Knight, like many populist leaders, preaches against economic inequality. \"No man should be poor just so that someone else can be rich.\" I can hear theater seats squeak as Republicans head for the exits. Knight's words, though, reflect the facts. Poor white Southerners were sabotaged by the slave economy and they knew it. That's why they deserted.\r But Republicans, if they sit through the entire film, will see how the Republican Party was the favored choice of freed slaves in the post-Civil-War era.\r There is a narrative problem in the film. The viewer expects \"Free State of Jones\" to end after the Civil War. I actually began tying my sneakers, readying to leave the theater. But the film keeps going in what feels like an anti-climax. Gary Ross, the filmmaker, wants to make a point: the Civil War was *not* the happy ending. The KKK rose up, and Jim Crow became entrenched. Black men who tried to exercise their right to vote were lynched. This is an important point, but the film should have been better structured so its narrative flow didn't stop before the film itself did.\r \"Free State of Jones\" was clearly made by sticklers for authenticity. Everyone looks dirty and tired. The clothes look like clothes people wore in the nineteenth century. A confederate officer's uniform looks baggy and tacky, not sparkling and admirable. Scenes are shot in lamplight. I loved this aspect of the film, as will Civil War re-enactors."

A movie that adults won't even sit through 30 minutes of one scene. My evidence? Just don't waste money on it. Free State of Jones may look promising, but don't let that look fool you. It's a trick to let them know you wasted hours hoping for something to some, but it never came anyways."

This is the Civil War and Reconstruction as THE American tragedy.  Be prepared to watch a lot of characters suffering.  Acting and production design is near or at the level of Spielberg.  Probably unknown to most viewers is numerous communal, cross-racial, intentional communities were tried in the late 1800s.  This was one of them.  This film was probably a labor love for all involved."

He plays a charismatic leader of a group of people that feel have been wronged during the American Civil War by the Confederacy.I found the Free State of Jones to be an excellent historical period war film. The story is very compelling which kept me riveted to the events of the movie. As someone that enjoys historical films I would suggest this movie to anyone that does as well."

Matthew McConaughey plays a soldier who treats the wounded but ends up \u201cdeserting\u201d his unit after a boy he knows gets killed in battle. After forming a ragtag militia he becomes a thorn in the side of a Southern LT who steals food and supplies from locals who\u2019s are barely getting by to begin with. This is a Robin Hood\u201d type of story set in the 1800s.I think it\u2019s  pretty well acted with a bit of action here and there\u2019s. It is definitely a bit long but I enjoyed watching it... The only thing I didn\u2019t like was a trial they kept flashing back and forth to throughout The movie. I definitely thought they could\u2019ve done without! All in all I feel it\u2019s a decent film and if you like period piece movies, especially the Civil War, I think you will enjoy this flick!"

Apparently many critics thought it was poorly done, or they are feeling some confederate itches because i've seen some really poorly made reviews on this movie.The story tells an untold story from a key moment in the fight against slavery, and shows ones again how rotten humanity and americans in particular have been throughout history. Matthew McConoughey plays excellent, and embodies the sanity and human caring that the world needs. This movie touches my heart strings, and i would love to see more like these."

      "text": "A country that existed for a brief time in the history of American.Once again, it proves that the critics are so dumb. In this people to people and people to filmmakers contact era, no one listens to them. Let them do their own sideshow. This was partially based on the real events that takes place in the following years of 1862. When America was fighting a civil war, a man named Newton Knight returned home from the battlefield where he started to help the farmers who were robbed by the armymen. Its like they are fighting their own war, to protect the land and the crops. They knew the consequence and so they were prepared for it.This is over a two hour long film and I think they had covered everything nicely. At some stage it looked like the Daniel Craig's 'Defiance'. But it reveals many events like changing time and the atmosphere, how they adapted to it along to move on. In the opening scene only they had shown us the war, but very soon it moved away to tell what's happening off the battlefield. Like how it's affecting the people. So the resistance emerges and the days going by they gain large power in the region. Very interesting perspective, though everything in the film was not true despite overall plot was inspired by the history.Matthew McConaughey alone steered the ship. You will like his performance. The locations were good, but most of them were either farmland or swamp. There's a little event that follows the 80 years later, just to disclose some court law debate over interracial marriage. Not a must see film, maybe if you are an American, then it might be, but other than that its a good watch. I hope the people would realise that and watch it.8/10"

Some of the movie is just walking around doing a bunch of nothing and funeral services. Also the part with Newton Knight's grandson shouldn't of been in the movie.

A secondary story of discrimination against a descendant in the 1950s is told in small segments. It's engaging, but not fully because the main characters are all too saintly or downright wicked."

It focuses more on the main character, witch did have a pretty big impact on the black society's first step to acceptance, so it is understandable but still not satisfying enough. Sadly the way the story is told is also pretty non-coherent so it's hard to understand everything at first watch. And the movie is simply boring enough not to demand a second viewing."

      "text": "It literally sickens me to my core to read on as the so called professional critics trash this film. Yes it has some flaws but it tells an important story that completely outs the democrat party for what they have been, what they are and what they can never not be. Any person with an iq over 80 should be able to see that something is fishy about a metascore of 53, that's 7 points under Wonder Woman 1984 which is the most expensive piece of absolute trash that Hollywood has generated in years. It is a film that unabashedly tries to commit suicide on a regular basis but never quite fully succeeds because it contains a single immortal credit that saves it from all criticism, a strong female lead. The incredible criticism that Free State of Jones received should be enough to inform any thinking individual of exactly how threatened Democrats are by it's very existence. It inundates them with inescapable and damning truths that are present but hidden still today. They have endeavored to educate people of the opposite, to demonize conservatives, to project their own hate and racism out onto anyone but themselves and they have largely succeeded for many generations. Look at the truth and then observe the den of hissing vipers for what it really is. They truly in their dark hearts miss the white hoods and the lynching but the world no longer accepts such evil and so they have moved underground and from their places of hiding they manipulate society and steer it back towards darkness under the veneer of healing and justice. Do not be a fool and don't be fooled. They hate this movie for no reason other than the fact that they cannot argue against plain and simple truth and such truth puts a wrench squarely into the machinery of their systemic and procedural will to absolute power."
