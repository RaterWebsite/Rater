It feels like too simple of a film, but in some ways that's actually a good thing. It doesn't take any risks, but it also manages to be light-humored at the same time. And the supporting name cast that includes Susan Surandon, Sandra Oh, Kathy Bates, etc, manages to make it worthwhile as well. So overall, while \"Tammy\" isn't hilarious, it's still a simple, lightly funny film that isn't too raunchy and zany like many of today's R-rated comedies."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "This movie is so awful ,That's three McCarthy movies in a row that were horrible.

Never again."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Melissa McCarthy is both well-known and great at playing crude, loud, and yet somehow likable characters. Seeing as how this movie was co-written by McCarthy and her husband, who also directed, this is a movie that was built from the ground up to play off of that character type and I was sure it was going to be hilarious. While it is funny it is also unfortunately bogged down by some lackluster and overly-familiar dramatic elements. It's very been there done that, and often that will apply to some of the movies jokes as well. There are some times when the jokes just fall flat, but thankfully the overall movie does pack plenty of laugh-worthy moments even if it does play things safe at times by not straying too far from what is expected of R-rated comedies nowadays. It's a good comedy, and while it's emotional moments fail to deliver, Melissa McCarthy is still funny enough to make it worth a watch. So if you've enjoyed McCarthy in the past I think it's safe to say that you'll enjoy the film.

I love McCarthy's acting and I hope she continues to entertain for years to come!

It's non-stop, no holds barred, bull in a china shop broad strokes in every scene.

Her typical slapstick comedy and over the top raunchy humor simply resonates with audiences, and in the meantime they flock to see everything she does. First off, I loved \"Bridesmaids\" (I mean who doesn't?). I throughly found tons of enjoyment, and laughs in \"The Heat\", and I hated \"Identity Thief\". Her latest, \"Tammy\" lands smack dab right in the middle. It's not as good as \"Bridesmaids\" and \"The Heat\", however it's far lightyears ahead of \"Identity Thief\".\rThe story comes from director, writer, and husband to McCARTHY Ben Falcone who got the film made on her box office appeal alone. Tammy ... is struggling, going about day to day life. This morning she hit a deer thus totaling her car. She also lost her job at Topperjacks to her egotistical manager (played by Falcone). And to top it off she comes home to find her husband (Nat Faxon) is cheating on her with the next door neighbor (Toni Collette). In a last ditch effort to reclaim her \"independence\". Tammy decides to go on a cross country road trip (of sorts) with her alcoholic and drug induced Grandmother (played very well by Susan Sarandon).\r Where \"Tammy\" severely lacks, it makes up for in McCARTHY's performance. The script is not as tight and condensed as it needs to be. Running at a very modest, and crisp 90-minute run time (something we ALL can be thankful for). The film saves itself from running to long to drag the morale of the audience down with it. Not to mention the cast itself is top notch (another added strength). Featuring a last second addition of Dan Aykroyd, to Mark Duplass and Gary Cole, the list goes on.\r Even if the script is loose and a retread, if anyone could have pulled this film off.. it was indeed McCARTHY. Weather your a fan or not, you can find something in \"Tammy\" that will at least make you chuckle. Though it's not consistent enough to be a full fledge comedy blockbuster, and when it falls flat (which it does a-lot) McCARTHY is right there to pick the film back up again. Best Joke? McCARTHY tells a skippy young teen to go eat some bath salts and then eat his girlfriends face off.\r B-\r By: Nate Adams for I-Tunes and The Movie Buff blog.\r Directed By: Ben Falcone\r Rated: R\rRun-Time: 96 mins\rStudio: Warner Bros.\rRelease Date: July 2nd\r Thanks For Stopping By \u00ae"}, {"rating": "0", "text": "melissa apparently sold her soul to make this sophomoric pun-riddled mess.  how in the world did susan sarandon let herself get dragged down to the bottom of the abyss?"}, {"rating": "1", "text": "Its a \"Rental\".

Though that may be true of most mediocre movies."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Melissa McCarthy stars in her first lead role and is a comedy mess for starters.\r It's about a woman named Tammy (Melissa McCarthy) who ends up losing her job at a fast food joint. She discovers her husband is cheating on her with the next door neighbour so she packs her clothes and walks two houses down to her mothers house. Soon after, she decides to move away but doesn't have her car or money. Her alcoholic Grandmother, Pearl (Susan Sarandon), does and tags along for the ride to Niagara Falls with a lot of booze. After falling off track and a series of misadventures that land her in hot water, she begins to re-think her life all the while dealing with her out of control grandmother who is more trouble to handle sober then she is drunk.\r Melissa became well know for her role in Bridesmaids and she made us howl laughing with Identity Thief. Her new movie Tammy is an unpleasant comedy that has no story, no evolution to it and jumps from one thing to another and continues throughout the whole film.\r Aside from the fact that it does seriously make you laugh throughout the movie, because of Tammy, the jokes are all one liners and they mostly come from her while Susan Sarandon is unfunny as her booze guzzling grandmother. The whole character is played out on laughs because she has booze hidden everywhere and it runs dry very fast. The story drags on from one thing to another while it slows to explain events of the character's life and why they don't like each other then continues on with the same thing.\r The one thing about the film that drags is that Tammy is made out to look like a slobbish piggy loser. It also attacks her weight in seriously insulting scenes that make you feel bad for the character because she wants to be human like everyone else. While everything goes wrong for her, they make her feel even worse about herself by calling her a \"Cheeseburger\" and \"Fat slob\" and it is not funny at all to watch. Melissa McCarthy is a beautiful woman and to have scenes of this nature in the film, because she is a bigger woman, is a poor excuse for jokes and ends up making you shake your head in disbelief and disgust.\r It seems like this was her dream project because she wrote it with her husband Ben Falcone, who makes his debut as well, but the acting to it is shaky and alone Melissa pulls off the acting to the movie. Kathy Bates just hangs in the shadows in some scenes and offers advice to Tammy about her life and then she even falls short soon after along with Susan who is a drunk mess.\r It's sad to see actors/actresses who are very well known, fall short in their roles and look like it is their first time on screen from either little screen time or due to bad writing that makes them look foolish. Granted, it does have laughs and will make you howl but if you look at the overall of the film, it's a wild mess that makes you wonder what happened and Melissa is the only good thing to watch for the film. She proves she can do comedy alone and make you laugh with her crude and foul mouth.\r Tammy is a mess and not what was expected. It's good for a few laughs but other pictures are a lot better and funnier."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I can never get tired of watching this movie.

This film was nominated for the worst actress and supporting actress at Razzie Awards, but I found they were awesome. You can't blame performers for the bad story, in fact the screenplay was okay, but again the story did not influence to build a better screenplay. Hard to predict the scenes, though one would know where the story is heading and that's the difference in this movie. Keep in mind when you're going try it, that you're not watching a Bond movie or a Peter Jackson's, but a small budget comedy. Anticipate as much what the movie weighs, overall and you would never regret for watching it.\r As usual a perfect role for Melissa McCarthy, but Susan Sarandon was surprisingly good. It was just a fun road-movie, mostly a semi-fictional to the reality, but who knows there might be people out like these film characters. Like I said, a decent story, it had all the ingredient to be a good comedy flick except one serious scene at the end needed to turn over. Yep, I would have liked to have an unexpected twist, that could have been a game changer in the movie's success. Anyone can enjoy it, if he's/she's open minded. I am already expecting the next movie from the same cast and crew combo which is due early next years.\r P.S, there's something between Melissa McCarthy and prison. In the next film I mentioned as well she will be seen in the prison.\r 6/10"}, {"rating": "4", "text": "A movie that tries to make you like some very unlikeable characters.

Melissa McCarthy is Tammy (the film's title) she is down on her luck, she is fired from her job from a burger-joint, her husband cheated on her, so she leaves and goes on a trip with her alcoholic grandmother (Susan Sarandon).

Doing movies like this will only hurt her career as most like myself will be hesitant to go see her in anything else if she strings several like this.  Such a great cast is totally wasted, why they would do a movie like this is beyond me!  I only chuckled once when she told the cops she had a bee in her hair and was running.

That being said, their first collaboration is still not a nice try given the involved star-studded talents. It takes amazing talents such as Kathy Bates, Dan Aykroyd, Allison Janney and Sandra Oh as underused and useless supporting actors to the story.There are few chuckle-able and giggable moments in the movie, but it never saves Tammy in its poorly written script and terrible direction.VERDICT: McCarthy and Falcone's collaboration is a wasted comedy movie, missing in comedy."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Usually I prefer my comedies to be funny, but maybe thats just me.
