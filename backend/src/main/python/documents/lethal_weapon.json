      "text": "One of Mel Gibson's better efforts, but it still has more than its share of cliche's. It is indeed very fast paced and has some great action sequences. I am not at all a fan Mel Gibson, so it may effect my rating. Others may enjoy it more."

      "text": "They don't make em like this anymore. Unabashed macho testosterone fest with just enough vulnerability & humanity to make us gals weak at the knees. Glover's gentle puppy dog eyes as he rolls his head around before taking his man out with one shot, and Mel's wild law man on the brink crossed with that kooky little-boy streak (\"I'm hungry\") - potent magic potion, this. Guilty pleasure? Maybe. But I feel no guilt at admitting that I've watched this franchise a number of times."

      "text": "A very strange movie for me, mostly thanks to Mel Gibson as Riggs. He has weird hair, weird accent and his way of taking down bad guys is totally ridiculous. Thankfully, Danny Glover gives a more or less normal performance that really stretches the intentional difference between the two. Gary Busey is also quite strange. Also the end fight between the two is plain silly. Gibson and Busey deck it out in the mud and rain near the end surrounded by gun wielding police officers. Why doesn't Riggs just let them arrest Busey? Questions like these really make you wonder what they were aiming for when they shot this movie. Music is good and there are some good action scenes, but the rest isn't worth watching."

      "text": "Mel Gibson and Danny Glover star in Richard Donners original action classic thriller, Lethal Weapon (1987) .. After a woman jumps from a high rise building Mel Gibson (Riggs) and Danny Glover (Murtaugh) are two cops who join forces to investigate the case and bring down the badguys. Gary Busey plays a good villain in Lethal Weapon and the acting is great by all the actors and it's a good action film with funny moments and plenty of violence and explosions and this film involves drugs. Lethal Weapon is a good film but not as good as the sequel, Lethal Weapon 2."

      "text": "Following the death of his wife, Los Angeles police detective Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) becomes reckless and suicidal. When he is reassigned and partnered with Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover), Riggs immediately clashes with the older officer. Together they uncover a massive drug-trafficking ring. As they encounter increasingly dangerous situations, Riggs and Murtaugh begin to form a bond. Riggs' volatile behavior might just help them apprehend the criminals -- if it doesn't kill them both first. The most successful installment in a phenomenally successful series, Lethal Weapon helped redefine action movies for the 1980's and 1990's. I'll give Lethal Weapon an A+."

This movie should'nt get a 7.8 IT NEEDS TO BE HIGHER This movie Beats Rambo, Bourne and callaghan. about the same as Bond and die hard... but if you want a great movie night that has Cussing, Explosions, Great Actors, Guns and Agreat director YOU HAVE IT!!!"

One guy... no, screw that, add another guy in there since he needs all the attention he can get, but who are we supposed to get? Hire Danny Glover since he needs attention along with Mel Gibson. Ok, not one guy anymore? Nope. Ok good. Let me start my script all over again.

      "text": "This film is one of the most interesting action films of the Eighties and started a brief, but interesting, film franchise. The key plot point is the collaboration and friendship between two substantially different policemen, but who have just been paired by their bosses: Murtaugh is an experienced middle-aged cop, disciplined in methods, married, a father and very attentive to his family ; Riggs is a police officer who has worked for several years in the Narcotics division and is experiencing severe depression, with suicidal tendencies that lead to impulsive, violent and risky behavior. Both are assigned to investigate the apparent suicide of a prostitute who is the daughter of a longtime friend of Murtaugh's, and who may be associated with a group of drug traffickers.In addition to the film having a good police story, the huge difference between the two protagonists and the way they manage to learn to respect and collaborate makes this film a good entertainment piece. It's not a movie made for thinking, nor is there a real mystery behind the crimes. It is an action-oriented film, punctuated by a light, intelligent and well-placed comedy. It's a movie made to enjoy and entertain.Much of the film's success rests on the back of its protagonist duo: Mel Gibson gives his character a bold, insane and intelligent aura, making good use of the opportunity and protagonism to popularize and leverage his career. Danny Glover is not far behind and offers us a mature, more restrained and intelligent performance. There are still several other actors, but none of them received material capable of allowing them to be highlighted.Technically, it's a regular action film, with elegant but understated cinematography, well-constructed sets and uninteresting costumes. The most notable technical aspect is the visual, special and sound effects department, which provides us with a job well done and realistic. There are lots of explosions, wrecked cars and insane fights that oscillate between the epic and the far-fetched, and the movie sometimes overdoes its spectacularity. The soundtrack is forgettable."
