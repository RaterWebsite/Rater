It truly shows how disconnected the critics are to the everyone else. Me and everyone i know that went to watch the movie truly liked it. Even people that had no knowledge on the Warcraft lore. A few friends even started playing after the movie. An amazing job by Duncan and the team. The actors were great and passionate and the CGI was one of the best i've ever seen. Go watch it, you won't regret it."

The majority of critic reviews are pathetic and should just be ignored. The CGI is mostly fantastic, and the story while it is a little rushed at the start is also pretty good. I saw the movie with two other people one who knows a little bit about Warcraft but who has only played WOW, and someone who has no interest in video games at all and they both loved it. I recommend if your a fan of Warcraft as a franchise go see it, if your a fan of high fantasy go see it."

      "text": "I Honestly don't even know why the movie industry has critics anymore... This movie is one of the movies that prove that critics just don't know what they are talking about. Now to give you some background, yes i am a gamer, no not any movie that is based on a video game is good, and lastly i have played a very small amount of WoW or Warcraft. To start this movie was no masterpiece, BUT it was a good movie. The story line although critics would leave you to believe that you need to know EVERYTHING about Warcraft in order to understand was surprisingly good. That being said the story is tough to follow ALTHOUGH not for the reasons stated by said \"critics\" The main problem the storyline has is that it throws out A TON of hard to pronounce and even harder to remember names that get the listener confused. How is someone that has never played a video game going to remember who's name is who's when there are names floating around like \"dalaran\", \"lothar\", \"Gorona\", \"Gul Dan\" etc. the answer is they wont, they get frustrated and stop because \"it doesn't make sense\" when they really mean that they are lost because they dont know who is who and what is what. Now imagine if the main character was named Jason and instead of saying the complicated names of cities and towns they started saying names like \"New York\" \"Tokyo\" and \"London\" that literally EVERYONE knows! yes that would make the movie easier to understand, but because people are too lazy to even try to remember a name as complicated as \"Medivh\"(i think i spelled that right) they give up and call the movie **** THERE IS A REASON THIS SHOW KILLED IT IN CHINA! long story short if you only watch movies to be TOLD a story instead of watching movies to LISTEN to a story then this movie will be tough to watch."

      "text": "I was lucky enough to see this at a Preview showing in IMAX 3D. Whilst the story and characters are only skin deep, this did not detract from the absolute spectacle that was on screen. Having been an on/off fan of the franchise for sometime - I really enjoyed watching characters on screen that I have been playing alongside for near two decades. Yes this is Fan fodder, and unashamedly so - that's a good thing. Definitely the best video-game inspired movie ever made and deserving of multiple sequels. My only complaint - the running time was trimmed too much, therefore there wasn't enough time to develop characters; the focus shifting between too many characters; within too short a space of time. In many ways I wish that had been a TV series rather than a movie, that would have given more time to give to character development and being in parts of well known locales. Ironforge and Dalaran were brilliantly rendered, but never on screen for long enough. That said, other movies like the Jurassic Park series had the same level of 2D characterisation and this did not detract from the stunning spectacle of the CGI dinosaurs. Warcraft has its flaws, but bloody hell is it one hell of a spectacular, no.. EPIC. Ignore the bad reviews, they are written by a constant flow of mainstream critics who wouldn't understand what Warcraft is about, or how deep its lore and canon is. If your a fan of the series its a must see, if your not a fan of the series - but are a lover of fantasy/sci-fi its a must see. If your tastes are more high brow then avoid this little gem."

I didn't really connect to the characters but the film is really able to sell the world. I felt immersed in a beautiful cinematic universe with believable fantasy wildlife and magical powers.\r The action was brilliant, The Magic was beautiful and the Overall quality of this film was really high.\r Honestly this film is a 7/10 for me, I'm giving it 9 to help the average as the Critics genuinely angered me on this one."

      "text": "As a fan of the Warcraft games (Both RTS and MMO) for over 10 years now I wear my bias on my sleeve. The film's greatest strength is in the love and care that have gone into adapting this world for the big screen. Its a difficult task to try and distill over 20 years of lore and storytelling from one medium to another. Even more difficult is trying to tell a coherent story from this material in the space of two hours. The film largely succeeds in doing so despite a few stumbles.\r Blizzard and Duncan Jones wisely chose to start from the beginning. The story is fairly simple but serviceable. If I had one criticism its that the story is fairly generic compared to those found in later games. But that isn't a slight against the film as the movie is a faithful adaptation of that story. It wasn't until Warcraft 3 that I really felt that the storytelling really became interesting.\r The film can be a bit too fast paced in the beginning of the film which I do think may be disorienting to those who are not familiar with the lore. However I do feel that casual moviegoers can still have fun with it if they allow the film to exist on its own. If you can divorce yourself from the idea that the LotR is the standard of fantasy films I think you can have a great time with it and become invested in its characters.\r The cast does a great job of bringing these characters to life in my opinion. Durotan and Drakka are notable standouts. Lothar and Khadgar have decent chemistry between them and I would have even liked to have seen more of it. I know Ben Schnetzer has been criticized in other reviews but I actually quite liked him as Khadgar. Another casting choice I have seen criticized is Ben Foster's Medivh. Again I actually thought he put in a decent part as Medivh. I would be remiss however if I didn't give praise for Daniel Wu's Guldan. They captured Guldan's cunning and ruthlessness perfectly.\r The special effects are quite special indeed. I really do think the effects are a visual feast for the eyes. I saw the film in 3D and I even liked the extra sense of depth it added to the experience. I never really was taken out of the film by something looking fake or out of place. I found myself easily immersed in this lovingly crafted world.\r The score was solid as well. If you have played the games you will recognize familiar themes from the games as well as some original music. The fantastic audio extends to the sound effects as well. Punches feel like they have power behind them and even the sword strikes and magic carry spectacular weight through the sound design.\r Its worth noting that there is an abundance of fan service in the film and it never really felt too on the nose but there were some very clever subtle uses of it. Some of these may be lost on casual movie goers but I don't think they will detract from anyone's enjoyment of the film.\r In the end Warcraft is a solid fantasy film and one I recommend to any fan of the property. For die hard lore fans there are some changes made to the lore but they too never detract from this adaptation. If you are a casual moviegoer my advice is to just go into the movie with an open mind. Not every movie has to be a Lord of the Rings. I do hope we see sequels so that we can get the Lich King on screen someday."

It is like trying to collapse half a season of game of thrones into 2 hours.\r This makes it feel a bit rushed, but that's not on the actors or the direction, rather on how much they tried to squeeze in, making the writing a very difficult task.\rBecause of this, they lost a lot on character development and we don't get to relate much to Durotan or the Orc culture.\r The settings and art are beautifully done, the acting is adequate though limited by the fact that they couldn't develop that many characters concurrently.\rThe adaptation is impressive, albeit not loyal to the lore. It is worth noting that Warcraft lore is more of a history than a narrative.\r Critics never really gave the movie a chance, and if you read the reviews, you can tell how they never tried to understand it.\r Give it a chance, most questions you might have might at the end will be answered in the sequels"

Azeroth is the world where this story takes place. When the Orcs planet was destroyed, they use a magic portal to get to Azeroth and make a safe home. But that is where humans and other intelligent species live peacefully. A new race means a new conflict to solve the differences. So the battle commences at no time to gain the power to rule the land. Between the two great powers, who wins is the film to tell us in the rest of the parts.\r It was something like 'Avatar' and 'The Lost of the Rings' coming together. Despite having alien race, it is very much an action- fantasy film, not a sci-fi. From the games to film, it was awesomely made which is obviously a latest trend in the filmmaking. The graphics were good, but not perfect, and that's fine, because it succeeds to give the game look than the realistic one. I think that's the point, otherwise no disgrace to call it was inspired by the games or comic book.\r I know it is not a masterpiece like 'The Lord of the Rings', but there's a promise like the quality and story and its characters. There's no big names, but these actors who are known mostly for their supporting roles has given their best. Like I said I'm new to this Warcraft universe, so I don't know anything outside this film, but I'm kind of neutral on the war between the humans and orcs. Because one's world was destroyed and they're seeking a new home and the other ones are defending theirs. So everything makes sense from both the perspectives for their actions.\r This is just a beginning, there's lot more sequels to come. Though, it's a pity that it failed in America, the native product, but internationally proved it is one of best of its kind, I mean games to screen adaptation. The director of 'Source Code' did a great job and all the actors, including those motion-capture artists. I missed Zoe Saldana in this, to be as another blue or green skinned alien specie, instead Paula Patton did well in a similar role. The character name also very similar to the one from 'Guardian of the Galaxy'. I know it's going to get even bigger in the follow-up, so I can't wait for it. Hope it will release in less than couple of years.\r 8/10"

The action was also well done, considering human actors were battling CGI orcs (though the humans often became CGI after putting their greathelms on). The environments were stunning. The overhead shots of great capital cities like Stormwind and the floating city of Dalaran were impressively detailed. The magicians' spells looked much better than Gandolf the Grey. The wolves, horses, and gryphons also looked spectacular. Overall, the movie was visually epic.\r The plot hewed closely to the original Warcraft video game's plot--which was a good thing, IMO. Due to the 2 hour time constraint, the movie moved at a dizzying speed and tried to cram in as much as possible. In the trade off between remaining authentic to the source material and cutting things to make the movie more watchable, Duncan Jones chose the former. And thank God he did. Fanboys of the world rejoice.\r A lot of casual references were made to Azeroth's characters and lore that required intimate knowledge of the game. When characters casually referenced the Redridge Mountains, Goldshire, Blackrock Mountain, Deadwind Pass, etc., I possessed a detailed knowledge of exactly what they were talking about (having ventured there many times myself), whereas casual babbies prob got confused. Same thing with all the names--Gul'dan, Medivh, Lothar--you get the picture. Same thing even with the jokes. Example--murlocs were considered a humorous enemy in World of Warcraft that made a distinctive gargling sound when attacked--the exact same audio recordings were used in the movie, which caused me to L\u00f8l W\u00fct.\r Some parts of the movie were predictable and uninteresting. A certain character died midway through. This elicited zero emotional response from me. I gathered early on that the only reason for that particular character's existence was to be slain to add emotional oomph to the movie. Judging from the music, the movie makers intended that scene to be quite dramatic. It failed entirely. But overall I was on the edge of my seat throughout.\r I loved the atmosphere at the theater--fanboys shouted \"For the Horde!\" at various intervals, and I of course responded with cries of \"For the Alliance!\" I definitely recommend seeing this one in IMAX 3D. It's the only way to do such a fantastic film justice."

Having said that, the rest of the movie was unimpressive, in the way that the first film of a series often is. It introduces characters and gives a rough background. So, go see it, once, for no more than US$9 or local equivalent and if you can't avoid saying \"ready to work,\" or \"zug zug,\" you probably won't be sad. To the professional critics I ask, \"what you want?\""

It was a good fantasy movie in its own right, with great visuals, good pacing, and nice action scenes.  I hope there is a sequel or maybe they will decide to make a starcraft movie, which would also be great."
