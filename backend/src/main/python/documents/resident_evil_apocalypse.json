It isn't a great movie at all, but it isn't meant to be and it's a lot more fun than the original. My two gripes are that the CGI hasn't improved much (but it's still an awful lot better than in the original) and Nemesis didn't feature quite as heavily as I expected. The thing that made the movie was how fun it is. It doesn't try to be serious and just takes you from one action scene to the next in style, and that's what I expect from a movie like this."

      "text": "For the first ten minutes or so of Resident Evil: Apocalypse, you could be forgiven for thinking you're about to watch a decent film. Don't be fooled, Apocalypse is really quite awful. The budget may have increased, but the story is meandering and ridiculous, characterisation non-existent, acting wooden, and script all too often unintentionally hilarious. It breaks my heart to see decent actors like Thomas Kretschmann and Jared Harris (who's the best thing in this film by quite a way - at least he attempts to imbue his character with a degree of humanity) involved in schlock like this. It's really quite an achievement for filmmakers to imbue their characters with so little life that they start to resemble the reanimated corpses that they're fighting - almost the entire cast act like they're part of amateur dramatics society, and not a good one at that, this even goes for Milla Jovovich, with all her charisma and ability to kick your face off with her sturdy boots. The bigger budget really didn't help matters, and just gave director Alexander Witt an excuse to waste money on boring and poorly executed set pieces. Yes, there is more running, gunning and explosions than in the first film, but at least the action the first Resident Evil did have was entertaining (do you have anything to match the laser scene, Apocalypse? I think not). Unfortunately, Resident Evil: Apocalypse is the kind of film that'll stay with you for a very long time, as its sheer ineptitude and soullessness truly is the stuff of nightmares."

Resident Evil: Apocalypse takes all the camp video game fun of the 1st film and chucks it on the cutting room floor for the zombie dogs to eat. Milla Jovovich returns as Alice to kill some more zombie ass and take some more names and she is joined by some even more stunted characters on her way in the shape of Sienna Guillory's Jill Valentine (who managed to make her even more idiotic than the video game version) and Oded Fehr's Carlos Olivera (the dud from Resident Evil 3). Although at first it tries to build a tone of dark and depressing (I mean it is the zombie apocalypse) it quickly realises its failing and turns back to camp, but throws so much of it at the viewer its like watching West Side Story and Flash Gordon all at the same time. Long story short, its terrible and a little part of your soul will be gone after watching this. you might even forget how to talk properly and have a hankering for human flesh."

It acts as a figurative melting pot of ideas from W.S. Anderson, who has apparently watched a couple of gameplay videos of the Resident Evil games, but has never actually played one himself. Aside from the diabolically pathetic 'plot', the movie boasts lingering and repetitive action sequences, which are unequivocally textbook in execution. Included in this tour-de-farce is a hackneyed story, flagrant slow motion, unnecessary angled camera shots, embarrassing one-liners, paper-thin characters, dreadful dialogue... okay, you get the picture -- it sucks; avoid."

      "text": "The second movie of the franchise. It continues after the events of the prequel and uses the Resident Evil 2 and 3 games for inspiration while not being an adaptation of those. It continues the story of Alice who awakens in a hospital and escapes. Meanwhile Raccoon City is quarantined by the Umbrella Cooperation as the virus escapes their secret facility. They are in full damage control mode and want to silence all witnesses and destroy all evidence. Because Alice is a threat they send a newly developed enemy after her who will become her Nemesis;-). For me this movie is a hit and miss. Resident Evil 2 and 3 were excellent games back then and helped to shape the survival horror videogame genre and this franchise. I like that they use many ideas, themes and aspects of these games. My complaint is that they should have used more. Many of us thought that these 2 games are excellent choices for an adaptation.  Another point is that this started the \u201cWhat the f*** is Umbrella doing questions. From movie to movie their plans make less sense and become something maybe Nostradamus could arcive as the events and outcomes are not predictable nor should be included into a strategy. Also they start using characters from the games that are different in irritating ways. For example Jill Valentine is far less competent while being the same character. Resident Evil 3 Jill Valentine would do really well in this setting and does not need help. Carlos and Nicolai are not up to their counterparts. The Nemesis is nothing against his menacing counterpart that haunts you. Gamers still feel terror when they hear his deep scratching voice saying \u201cStaaars\u201d. What saves this for me are the actors. Again Milla Jovovich is great as Alice, Sienna Guillory is still a good Jill Valentine that I could imagine in her own movie. I like also the Ashford family here. The story is engaging but a bit foreseeable. I could strangely predict many twists and outcomes. This might sound to negative as I still enjoyed this movie. It is not a mistake or even bad. However it is also nothing you will remember often or discus with friends in \u201cmovies we could / should / must rewatch\u201d arguments. Overall a solid sequel and worth watching but not remembering."

      "text": "Perhaps the least necessary movie sequel since \u201cBenji: Off the Leash,\u201d \u201cResident Evil: Apocalypse\u201d picks up where the surprisingly profitable 2000 original left off, telling another tale of T-Virus-infected zombies wreaking havoc in fictional Raccoon City. Calamitously uninspired and borderline incoherent, new pic lacks even those fleeting pleasures (namely, a sense of humor) that made the first film a passable popcorn attraction.\r Conceived as a prequel of sorts to the enormously popular videogame series, which in turn owes more than a bit to George Romero\u2019s \u201cLiving Dead\u201d trilogy, first \u201cResident Evil\u201d pic depicted the outbreak of the corpse-reanimating T-Virus in the underground lab (known as the Hive) of the sinister Umbrella Corp. Trapped inside during the ensuing lockdown, a small band of uninfected survivors tried to escape. In the end only two did: amnesiac security guard Alice (Milla Jovovich) and Matt (Eric Mabius) who was searching for his missing sister. Just when it seemed as though the worst was over, Alice and Matt were abducted by shadowy Umbrella employees amid talk of something called the Nemesis program. (New pic was originally known as \u201cResident Evil: Nemesis,\u201d until the failure of the bigscreen \u201cStar Trek\u201d entry bearing that same subtitle.)\r At the beginning of \u201cApocalypse,\u201d all seems well again in Raccoon City. Then, in the interest of figuring out \u201cwhat exactly happened down there,\u201d some Umbrella honchos approve the reopening of the Hive, which in turn unleashes a new wave of zombie terror on the unsuspecting city above.\r Interested only in preserving its corporate image, Umbrella Corp. seals off Raccoon City, allowing its denizens to gradually devour each other.\r Umbrella does try to evacuate a few \u201chigh-priority extractions,\u201d including paraplegic company scientist Dr. Ashford (Jared Harris) and his teenage daughter, Angie (Sophie Vavasseur). But the SUV transporting the girl crashes, stranding her amid the zombie infestation.\r Meanwhile, another posse of survivors is forming, led once again by Alice, who has been infected, guinea pig-style, by Umbrella Corp. with both the T-Virus and its antivirus.\r Along for the ride are tough-talking female cop Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory, in vidgame-esque tight-fitting top and ultra-miniskirt), the leader of Umbrella Corp.\u2019s elite tactical rescue team (Oded Fehr); and the obligatory fast-talking hustler type (Mike Epps).\r Unable to get help for Angie from Umbrella\u2019s nefarious Major Cain (Thomas Kretschmann), Dr. Ashford promises to provide Alice and her group with safe passage out of Raccoon City for the safe return of his daughter. So begins a tiresome game of cat-and-mouse, as the rescuers make their way toward the girl while doing battle with the same assortment of baddies introduced in the previous pic.\r The only major new element is the Nemesis creature itself \u2014 a giant monster that may or may not be a mutated version of the Matt character from the first pic. Otherwise, new pic is less an advance on its predecessor than a re-staging. But dramatic energy is dissipated in transposing the setting from the claustrophobic, bunker-like environs of the Hive to the spacious city.\r First-time director Alexander Witt seems at a greater loss than previous helmer Paul W.S. Anderson in staging action sequences. The movie is so underlit and overcut it is frequently impossible to discern what\u2019s happening. If this were a videogame, one would be compelled to return it to the store for a refund.\r As before, pic racks up some novelty value for its willingness to let its heroines do as much or more of the ass-kicking as its heroes, though Guillory doesn\u2019t seem to be having nearly as good a time as Jovovich.\r But the whole enterprise registers as a missed opportunity when one considers the satirical potential of the premise, particularly in this moment of Enron and the other corporate scandals \u2014 exactly the sort of sociopolitical subtext Romero has played up in his work and that even this year\u2019s lackluster \u201cDawn of the Dead\u201d remake tapped into more effectively than this assembly-line offering."

      "text": "The story in this film has a nice base, the first movie worked really fine, and now they kind of do the same thing, but bigger, instead of a confined underground place, the zombies reach the whole Raccoon City, that idea of bigger, i don't quite like it, but i did enjoy the atmosphere as well, the whole idea of being in a sieged city with no way out and a lot of zombies inside is nice, the whole prologue where we see normal people around and the Umbrella members opening the hive is very nice. The story overall is about a run away, an escape of that place, it is ok, there isn't many aspects that make it unique, and is based on convenience and coincidences all the time, and that pisses me off, i really dislike when something crucial to the story happens based in a coincidence or covenience moment, but when it does happens a lot, that is just so bad, like some character finding the other out of nowhere, in a giant city they got so lucky to find eachother, come on, the first time that Alice meets Jill and the others is so ridiculous and so out of nowhere per example. There is one moment in the bridge, where you can see a whole bunch of people, like the the bridge is almost full of people, and when the officers there evacuate everybody that is there, they went back to the city, but when the movie goes back to there, there isn't anyone in the streets, where all of that people went? there a lot of zombies but there is no way that all of these people would become zombies that fast, it feels like a abandoned city, wich gives a cool atmosphere but at the same time it didn't fit on what they were showing before. The 3rd act of this film is totally a mess, for the video game fans it is ofensive, in Resident Evil 3, the game, Nemesis was a really scared dude that was impossible to kill and was always running after you in a crazy speed, every time that you heard that \"STARS\" you knew that you had to run because **** got serious. Nemesis in this film isn't scary or anything, his visual are fun, but what they did to him dosn't really have the same feeling as the game, but that isn't a big of a problem. The fact that Alice all the time exchange punches with Nemesis is really a horrible thing, more at the end when she fighting with him one on one that is all ridiculous, the conclusion of that battle is even worst, they completed lose a chance to make a remarkable villain like he is on the games. More towards the end you can see Alice killing someone with telekinesis, and that is where Resident Evil movies completed threw it down, a super character in this kind of films just doesn't work, because what would even happen to her if she is a super human against zombies and stuff and can even beat Nemesis one on one, is just isn't fun anymore there is no danger feeling.Jill Valentine is probably the best thing in the movie, even if she wasn't used as well as she could. Jill Valentine is by far my favorite Resident Evil characters from the games, i really went through many things with her in Resident 1, 3, 5 and other games, so we are very familiar already. In this film, first, the way that she looks and dresses is exactly like the game Resident Evil 3, it is so perfect how she is compared to the game in a way that i don't think that we have any other so close to the original in any other video game movie this far. Sienna Guillory portrays her perfectly, she is badass, she speaks with autority, she is well decided on what she do, and also is a very respectful person, i really like her, is to bad that Alice is always over her.The action in this film with Alice are just sad, she having super jumps or super moves, that is not fun, the way that it is filmed is also incomprehensible, the camera have some blurs and some strange slow motions, i really don't get what they were trying to do. The action with Jill and the others, does work, so as the scary and thriller moments, there some nice badass moments with Jill, some moments where you can totally feel the vulnerability of them compared to what they are getting into, it is good. The Star team that gets in the city is also good in action, they have some choreography moves that are fun to watch.One thing that it is good in this film, but it could have been much better, is the atmosphere that they created. The whole thing in the city, with small streets, giving claustrophobia in some situations with a lot of zombies in a small space, that was nice, the ambience in the curch was also well constructed, with water and darkness, far noises. But overall around the city, i felt it much simple, even compared to Resident Evil 3 from playstation one, there was many more places that you could feel that there were something wrong, just by when you stepped there, or even the first movie from this franchise, i think that there is a lack of details that really bothers and makes the difference."

I hate the fact that Alice, once again is back, and she lives through another stupid near death experience. I don't like the way they used Nemesis....... I CANT! Nemesis will rule all!!!! I tell ya! But in this movie, Anderson did a HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE job with the placement, role, and scenes with Nemesis. The Nemesis in RE3:Nemesis, would go after S.T.A.R.S members which, hence, is the purpose of the B.O.W. But in the movie, he was commanded to take out S.T.A.R.S, not on his own will. Nemesis was also created for hand-to-hand combat, not to actually use the chaingun or Rocket Launcher, which thankfully was there. In the game, he used the RL, true, but he overly used it in the movie. Jill's role was bad too. Jill sucked... Where was Brad? Where's the plot with Nicholia (The main thing in RE3!) ?!!! Alot of things were wrong with Nemesis, the cast, and the movie itself, but alas, as a Resident Evil die-hard fan, I must go where the plot and stuff takes me. So for now, I''m happy with a 5/10, but not happy with the ending results of the movie. I will be fully happy with the movies, when Alice finally meets the ground.....in hell."

Seriously, that pretty much NEVER happens to me, unless the movie sucked so bad that it wasn't worth remembering which was clearly the case in this instance. (Actually, it happened to me with S.W.A.T. as well) What a completely flat and boring action movie! And both of the \"tough women\" in it were so damned skinny that just about any man who weighs over 150 pounds could toss them around like rag dolls anyway. Suffice it to say that suspension of disbelief only goes so far!"

Men, the movies are pretty bad..entretainig, but they don't have nothing to do with the great story that charmed me in '90's...oh well, i guess there's no hope for the resident evil:exticion (aka resident evil 3)...still, I LOVE RESIDENT EVIL!!!! AAAAAAAAH!"

I had not seen these movies because of all the bad reviews i heard about from everyone. I love the games! I thought the first movie could have been better but this second one was great! It had a lot of references to the 2nd and 3rd RE games. No movie can be just like the game but i thought this one did a good enough job. As for a Zombie movie, I thought this movie was one of the best! If it wasn't for it being based on a game, i bet it would have gotten a higher score! Overall, very pleased! now i can't wait to see the 3rd one!"

      "text": "This is the least of the live-action trilogy, but it's still a highly enjoyable and over-the-top action film. Sure some fight scenes were a bit cheesy, but the rest of the film makes up for that by having Milla Jovovich kick a great deal of ass. The Nemesis fights were pretty awesome and the film never got boring. People complained about the story, but I had no real gripes with it. This film was a great zombie action film that is great popcorn fun."

      "text": "This movie is outstanding. The actors are perfect models for the actual Resident evil characters. Seinna Guillory is perfect for Jill Valentine as well. The action is outstanding and the story is great. It kinda gets off the track of the Resident Evil games but who cares? It's an outstanding movie with great action. You must purchase this movie to see some real great action."

      "text": "It is certainly the one film of the franchise that genuinely tries to incorporate the most RE lore into it. Nemesis was fun to watch but sadly not as heavily featured as I hoped he would be. I think adding Jill was a bit forced as we already had a strong female protagonist in Alice and I felt that Jill took a lot of the screentime away from her.Apocalypse also suffered from a lot of poor directing (constant close-ups, parts needlessly in slow motion) that made the movie a bit of an eyesore at times. The story featured far too many branching narratives that poorly come together rather than simplifying it a bit in order to focus on developing characters that could potentially be in the franchise for the long term.Overall, It was certainly a watchable movie, which far exceeds what I can say about most films in the franchise, but it is far from perfect."
