      "text": "It's true. I'm an Angelina Jolie fan for all the wrong reasons. For my taste, she is at her best playing an action heroine and oozing sexuality. Make it a spy thriller and you can pretty much bet that I'll be first in line. In my opinion, there are two ways to evaluate any film. You can consider its technical elements and the precision of its actors, or you can just ask yourself if you enjoyed it. Well, I'm going with the latter this time, and I enjoyed the hell out of Salt.Without giving away too much, I can tell you that the film is a spy thriller with lots of double crossing. In fact, the story is quite outlandish and barely even believable (okay, I lied, it's really not believable at all). But it's FUN. It keeps you guessing and rooting for the bad guy, or good girl, or whatever you want to classify Jolie's character as. She plays a spy who is suddenly outed as an undercover Russian agent when a very wanted Russian bad guy claims that she will soon kill the Russian President during his upcoming trip to America. That makes sense, right? Don't worry about it. Trust me. It will. And even if it doesn't, you won't care because it will be too loud and there will be too many explosions for you to remember what was supposed to happen anyway.Salt is a thrill-ride. It's pure crazy fun and Jolie does a decent job of trying to keep it together. But with three versions offering three separate endings on the DVD, this is one you can watch over and over and still get a kick out of every time. You might need to suspend reality just a tad when viewing it, and have something to wipe away the drool, but it will be worth it."

      "text": "The more we run, the more they chase. It is what happenned to Evelyn Salt. Since Mat Damon BOURNE IDENTITY (2002) which is using more advance believability approach in runaway espionage tale, now everybody wants to be Bourne by running, jumping, shooting, fighting, car-chase, motorcycle-chase, you-name-it and it all happenned in one action-packed. Couple examples which using the similar patterns are: John Travolta FROM PARIS WITH LOVE (2009), Tom Cruise KNIGHT AND DAY (2010), Ashton Kutcher KILLERS (2010) and now it is Jolie turn. The story follows Evelyn Salt (Jolie) who has been instant-accused as a Russian spy who may be able to jeopardizing the national security. The Director is Phillip Noyce, the man behind THE BONE COLLECTOR in 1999 (also with Jolie). The camera angle is dynamic, especially in action sequences. Yes, the movie is full of twists and turns, even sometimes the story just go by itself without proper explanations, leaving too many questions and missing links. That is the uniqueness of the plots! The story is intriguing. It is successful to make us stay put in our seat by expecting what is going to happen next. To let Jolie fuses into action adventure like thiz is like releasing the fish into water, it is what she does best. Jolie is still the focus, shines among her mysterious partner (Liev Schreiber) and plain-straight boss (Chiwetel Eijiofor). If someone complains about how absurd thiz narratives has become, it is simply arguable and it all happens to every modern action movies. One thing for sure, Jolie is back with some kiss-ass moves, to show us she is definitely one of the most comfortable action heroines in our time. Thiz SALT is happened to be sweet more than you think it is.\r Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE on : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com"

      "text": "With all due respect to James Bond, Evelyn Salt(Angelina Jolie) does it better, at least since, incidentally, Lewis Gilbert's \"The Spy Who Loved Me\", made in 1977, when the Cold War was still cold; when the Russians, by far, made the best villains. For those who can remember, \"Salt\" makes you nostalgic for the days when the ABC telefilm \"The Day After\" scared you silly. The \"evil empire\"(Ronald Reagan's words) was good for the action-thriller genre. Islamic fundamentalism? Not so much. The Arabic language, and more importantly, the Arabic accent, have little or no entertainment value, no camp kick(i.e. Nazi Germany), at all. That's why Jonathan Demme's retooling of John Frankenheimer's \"The Manchurian Candidate\" will never work on the level of escapism, even if the United States someday makes peace with the Muslim world. Russians are more fun: that's the masterstroke of \"Salt\". The Russians still have active sleeper agents; the Russians still hate our guts(who knew?), a whopping nineteen years after the Soviet Union dissolved following the signing of the Belavezha Accords. For clarity's sake, the expository scenes that show the Russian children's training could have been more explicit in naming names. \"Salt\" never makes mention of that magic acronym(the U.S.S.R.), even though Orlov(Daniel Olbrychski) is a communist hardliner who still pledges allegiance to the hammer and sickle. The old school commie, a colleague of Brezhnev, is no doubt bitter about losing the Cold War, so \"Salt\" should have followed through with its bizarre retro choice in antagonists and made \"Day X\" less convoluted day of reckoning against the United States by being more pointed in their motivation. This splinter group, who as children resented Mikahl Gorbachev's employment of Glasnost to draw back the Iron Curtain, hates Americans every bit as much as the Muslims. That's the note that the filmmaker should have expounded on. Lest we forget, as an afterthought, \"Salt\" makes room for our current enemy when the final stage of \"Day X\" is revealed; that's when \"Salt\" becomes certifiably loony. But then, Jolie, in a scene reminiscent of Jack Ruby gunning down Lee Harvey Oswald in cold blood on live TV, reins in the overplotting with the sheer force of her presence, proving that it's she, and not Bond, or Bourne, who is the best. (Apologies to Carly Simon.) \"Salt\" is an inspired popcorn flick."

In the first 40 minutes I wondered what the point of all this running about shouting was. It all just seemed a bit silly and pointless. In fact, frighteningly it reminded me of a Bruckheimer film where running about, shouting, leaping onto and off things with lots of explosions and impossibly gorgeous women are stock in trade. Although I have never been a Jolie fan particularly, I kind of thought she was respected as a serious actress. Here, she looks like Megan Fox's auntie. This movie may have salt but I guess I was looking for a little balsamic dressing."

I'm not a Jolie fan, like anything with DiCaprio and a couple of others their name makes me think twice before going to see any movie they're in. But she did a great job here with a story that could have been far worse than any 24 script. The sleeper premise is far-fetched but if you can get past that it's a very entertaining film with more going for it than stunts and action. But since it's a summer movie there is plenty of both. I guess we need a break from reality and a trip back to the bad old Cold War days was almost a relief. I saw lots of happy faces leaving the theater after this one."

It doesn't hurt one bit that she's also one of the most perfect genetic productions of human evolution (beautiful!) ever to walk the planet.
