      "text": "Paddington 2 is equal in quality to the first film.  I don't think the Paddington movies are must see classics, but are sweet and funny and well made.  The most impressive aspect of the Paddington films are how realistic the bear is.  All the scenes with Paddington in them seem realistic and the interaction with the live actors is excellent.  Quite a technical feat.  I also thought Hugh Grant's performance as the bad guy was very good, showing a lot of goofiness and theatrics that we don't get to see in his usual low key performances."

      "text": "Possibly the best movie sequel of a family live-action pic in a long, long time.  First of all, the new installment inserts, in my opinion, a female predominance that is a little synthetic, forced and purposeful to the issues of today's women and men equality. In the opening scene, it's not papa bear who executes dangerous feats, it's Aunt Lucy, who proves to have enough guts, up to there a generous honor, however, all female sub-plots in the Brown family become erroneously comic: swimming an entire ocean or writing a men-free newspaper? Really? Fortunately, the excessive female empowerment ceases from there, and perhaps it'd have worked better if this cool load had been distributed throughout the film, the saturation of the onset didn't help at all. Moreover, the script is not exempt from showing stereotyped and traditional versions and failed comedy moments, but, they're, luckily, limited, opening the way to the eccentricities that enable it to be a family film, probably, belonging to the best of the best of the new century.As most of the supporting plots lack a solid and credible identity, writers Simon Farnaby and Paul King opt to deposit all their narrative inventiveness in the protagonist's central plot, since, in the end, it's he who must be under the spotlight, of course, an action made possible by a three-dimensional antagonist. Hugh Grant stands in for the main role in the scenes where the bear is missing, because this villain, a funny character and peculiar enough not to surpass the barrier of the absurd, makes possible the gratifying amount of comedy situations and justifies, eloquently, the progress of the story and its corresponding junctures. The acting power not only lies on the antagonist's shoulders, we also receive charming and juicy interpretations from actors such as Peter Capaldi and Sally Hawkins, creating a dynamic pace and a fluid connection with the audience. It's important to dedicate a whole paragraph to the unexpected humor of the feature film because supported by elements previously mentioned such as cast or artistic inventiveness, it manages to be one of the best shaped, most virtuous and functional comedies of recent times. It's known that within the feasible \"Paddington\" movie franchise, the comic factor rests mostly upon the shoulders of the dewy-eyed bear, because of this we see how, amusingly, different jobs pop up through the life of the animal. With all the different variables and combinations for comedy genre, the film chooses to put one more physical and boisterous in scenes where the nice protagonist is usually the architect, in the same way, it's evident a dynamic and sincere collective charm that always derives from the interaction between the characters and the leading role. Likewise, the screenwriters are perceptive enough to interweave every funny moment with subsequent situations, in other words, the characters or actions, they perform without intent, are generally part of a humorous range bigger than the achieved with a single scene, a better result. On this occasion, the vivid colors, an innate feature of the first film, return, however, it differs, radically, because they don't end up being cloying, Erik Wilson knows how to endow a film focused on a defined-personality animal, clearly, supported by a source of inspiration, however, this doesn't devitalize the enchantment and strength of a world that makes speeches through the visual landscapes with aplomb about hope and union. A major achievement is the artistic section of the work, it's dazzling and laborious the way in which they avoid ridicule moves even having pink-dressed prisoners, a family with extravagant garments or a metropolis with serious wrapping but colorful content; every little feature is visually coherent as a whole, a polychromatic whole. It's a huge victory for family comedies. Added to the handsome cinematography, it seems incalculable the number of special effects responsible who took an active part in the film, however, based on their work on specific scenes, it's possible to give approximations with full conviction. No wonder, Paul King's \"Paddington 2\" returns to the top, materializing splendid visual wills and proposing important teachings, operations that allow it to be a compelling film for general audiences; A creative and deep-felt comedy that means a real event because it vindicates the poor quality of the most recent family flicks. As a motion picture, it borders on the critical perfection and commercially  has become a moderate hit, however, the true victory of King's movie is to conceive one of the best cinematic adventures about love, family and, could not miss the peculiarities of a charismatic kind-hearted bear; creatively surprising and narratively dynamic, we welcome a feature film that is truly worth paying for, without noticing its smell of marmalade."

From Paul King's excellent direction that not only is full of energy (there is no slow moments in the film), but also having a ton of interesting shot composition too, to the fantastic cast, with Hugh Bonneville, Sally Fields, and Jim Broadbent returning to the cast and bringing their magic and enthusiasm to the films, and of course Ben Whishaw's warmth and tenderness as the voice to the titular bear, and with the new editions of Hugh Grant and Brendan Gleeson sharing scene stealing roles, to just the writing alone teaching fantastic life lessons to younger viewers and giving older audiences not just genuine laughs but a wonderful story that gives everyone with an open heart warmth and joy. There is no cynical bone in the film's body that usually ruin kids films like this. It's just a fantastic feel good film that is well made as a movie overall! I mean the set design, art direction, and even the coloring is top notch!Sadly, there is one major flaw with the film, the CGI. This is a complaint with the last Paddington film, because while the design of Paddington is great and there are a ton of characteristics and movements that are indeed spot on, the integration just isn't the best and often feel too unrealistic. It is not a deal-breaker as the movie is still a lot of fun regardless, but still it is a shame. Also there is a bad green-screen effect that is painfully obvious during the third act.Regardless, this is a must see for all ages!"

Remarkable in every single way possible, Paddington 2 manages to become the first real success I was looking for since 2018 just started. Sure Paddington Bear isn't as popular in the United States as he is in the United Kingdom, but I can guarantee that these adaptations deserve more attention than what we expect to see at the box office.

It could have been 'great' but it was merely 'good' due to two unrealistic scenes in the end that let it down for me.Related media: I have not read any of the children books, but I have seen the first film. I had only given it a 3/5. Please check out my review of it.What's it like?: Paddington the bear finds a wonderful pop-up book in a shop and he wants to earn the money to buy it and then send it to his aunt, but the villain wants the book too!Pros: 1) The first film appealed more to children, while this film has better acting and a more realistic plot and it has a broader appeal. Adults would enjoy this more than the first film.2) Hugh Grant had a great opportunity to display his diverse acting skills as the villain here and he did not disappoint.Cons: Everything was going well and I would have awarded the film 5/5, and then it had to show two highly unrealistic scenes towards the end!How would the the different age groups rate it?Children: ExcellentTeens: ExcellentYoung adults: GoodMedium age adults: GoodOld adults: GoodRating: 4/5 (no half scores). It's worthwhile to pay to watch it in the cinema."

And the most important of it all, that I used to be amazed about was how in the final act of the movie everything helps the lead character and by 'everything' I mean in every situation; however troublesome it was, it just worked. Paddington is definitely all of this and more to it whether it be then intense situations or deep characters or sketchy bad guys and with a soul in it which let's be frank is hard to find. Even though Paddington's first act is plotting characters and tracks, the key is they do it with a great conviction for it to not look like repetition or become a slog or suspicious for that matter. Hugh Bonneville is flat out funny and surprisingly so is Hugh Grant even though he is the bad guy. But Sally Hawkins is the bridge here that bonds this peculiar world to reality as her screen presence is soothing. Paddington is smart, well detailed and to the point and if there had not been any flaws; it would have been perfect."

That soft butter melting voice and great British charm. Even during his comedic mess ups, you can't get mad or annoyed at him. It's utterly delightful.Only Paul King can make this work. 'Paddington 2' lives up to the hype and doesn't suffer from sequel curse. I'm not trying to over hype it, but it's right up there with 'The Dark Knight' and 'T2: Judgement Day'. Stepping away from being just a kids movie, because how this movie is directed and shot I would put on the same level of iconic directors.You can see the influences of Wes Anderson with the framing, cartoonist colors, and comedic timing of every joke - Like an old fashion sense of humor. Even Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin can thrown into the mix in terms of chaotic scenes.The cast are stellar. My complaint from the first film about the family characters not being that interesting, well that's changed here. Sally Hawkins, Hugh Bonneville, Brendan Gleeson, and Julie Walters were fantastic in this. I hope Hawkins (Mrs. Brown) gets her spin-off detective film.Hugh Grant, on the other hand, is the show stealer here. He was freaking brilliant and makes one memorable villain. The different personalties he takes on to out smart everyone and you can truly see how, just how convincing it is. Paddington 1 & 2 have such complex villains.My only complaint isn't with the film itself, but Ben Whishaw doesn't like marmalade in real life"

Paddington 2 is more funny and heartwarming than the first one. They use all the elements of the first film and they made it better. Paul King writing and direction is perfect and really catches who's Paddington and the Browns. Hugh Grant is magnific as the villian, Dario Marianelli score is amazing and to be fair, I cry in the ending of how beautiful was. Go watch Paddington 2 now, it's worth the price and the attenton of how you make a good sequel."
