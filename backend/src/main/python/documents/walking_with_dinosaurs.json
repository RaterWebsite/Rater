I enjoy documentaries and this one could\u2019ve been no different. Unfortunately, this was ruined by the dubbing. Now dubbing the film was bad enough in itself as it clearly feels tacked on and takes you out of it but to take a step further this is bad dubbing. Think of those Dragonball Z abridged videos except with none of the whit. The dubbing makes this film painful to watch as it is generic and clich\u00e9 and gives us the most basic of stories. Had this film not been dubbed it could\u2019ve been a nice little film but as is it is awful. I wouldn\u2019t recommend watching it unless you have toddlers who couldn\u2019t care less but if you want to watch it get the DVD as it has a feature that turns of the dialogue. Its amazing how far the dubbing goes in making this film torture to watch but it does and the opening and beginning of this film was pointless and stupid."

      "text": "Walking with dinosaurs is focused towards younger viewers. It stops to identify the different types of dinosaurs in the film, and it is very light-hearted.\r The plot is sort of a coming of age story, and involves a Bambi-like loss of family. And a journey about growing up and learning to survive, and eventually lead. Not too deep, but really, no one came to see it for the plot. They came to see dinosaurs. Which there are many. Also possums?\r It also has a talking prehistoric bird named Alex, who is the fantastically hilarious protagonist and narrator of the story. Ignore the other dinosaur that narrates. It is about Alex."

      "text": "It's one part educational with impressive visuals, and one part goofy kids movie with irritating voice overs and dialog. For every time you learn about how a dinosaur acted or what their name meant, your going to have to deal with the lame jokes tossed out by the characters who just won't shut up. As far as the humor goes, only the youngest of audiences will get any laughs. Older audiences like myself will be left rolling their eyes. It makes for a great movie for the young dinosaur fanatic in your house, but that doesn't mean you'll enjoy watching it with them. While I appreciate that the film tries to each kids as much as it tries to make them laugh, the history lesson and childish humor don't mesh together in a way that will make this all that entertaining for their parents. Adults might get a slight kick out of seeing some cool dinosaurs looking great on screen, but this is one for the young dinosaur lovers. The younger the better, and there's not necessarily anything wrong with that. My total score for the film is a 6.4/10=Okay."

      "text": "This could have been a magnificent 3-D adventure, while it still has good 3-D there was one big issue from the very start. The moment this movie spoke its first bit of screenplay, I felt like I was going to rip my hair off! The screenplay is absolutely horrible! Plus, the characters are completely uninteresting in every turn, who came up with this crappy cast. But at times when the movie just went straight it's plain 3-D marvel, it felt good. But sadly, it doesn't last for long! Overall, this is a God-Awful piece of cinema! I feel that I should rate this movie lower, but I'm being pretty generous because of all the fantastic movies that have came out recently! I give this crap a D!"

      "text": "Spoiler: The plot is  WALKING. With DINOSAURS.\r Took my kids to see this during the christmas break. My son (3) is obsessed with Dinosaurs, and as such would be pleased with pretty much anything, but he got bored after a while. There were none of the 'big name' dinosaurs (no T Rex, no Triceratops, velociraptors or brachiosaurs), and the story was told in a weird 'voice over' of the characters conversing rather than them actually talking, or it being narrated properly.\r Can't recommend it at all. Personally, I'd struggle to pluck up the enthusiasm to watch it again if it was on the TV and I could do it for free..."

Another thing the begining of the movie is bad just some uncle taking his nephew and niece to dig up a fossil in Alaska and then  a bird talks to the nephew and it is trippy because there is no voice sync i did like the animation and atmosphere of the movie but this is the worst    way of the land before time but in CGI in 3-D i don't recomend whatching it if your a dinosaur fan or achiolagist watch it with your kid cause he'll like it"

Either way, what they supposedly say when they portray the dinosaurs sounds incredibly idiotic for a dinosaur to say if they had anything TO say."

Instead, what we get is a film full of poop jokes, annoying voice acting, and a script that is a rehash of cliches. If they release a silent version of this film, I'll like it, but as is, just don't even bother."
