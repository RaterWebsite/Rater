I don't want to spoil anything so I will not go into that but let's just say the \"love\" interest part is totally predictable.  The action is good and the special effects are on par with today's movies.\r My gripe would be the acting, mainly from the support characters.  The 2 leads are okay, and that is about it.  The rest of the cast pretty much mulls their way through their lines and shows no real character while doing so.  The main villain is not at all convincing as a psycho.\r In all, I thought this movie was exactly what I thought it was going to be: a movie I would watch, be satisfied that I didn't waste 2 hours and then forget about until I see it on TV some time later."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "It's corny, it's old-school, it's funny, and it knows it.

I loved it, and I especially loved Guy Pearce who played his part of the one-man-army-super-suave-badass beautifully. What's really terrible here are the reviewers that are overthinking this movie to a degree that is as preposterous as the plot. Space station full of convicts? President's daughter held captive?

Went to this movie not expecting much but was looking forward to just kicking back and watching an action flick. The only positive thing about this movie is Guy Pearce's peformance.

I constantly found myself along with my buddies laugh at the movie at all of the cheesy moments it had. The pace was ridiculous and the villian's were laughable and half retarded. Two monkey's covered in sh!t could have provided more meanigful performances. The graphics.....lol video games in the mid 90's had better graphics then this.

The only thing good about it was the sarcasm by Guy Pearce. Everything else was dreadful. The plot itself is cliche and just plain dumb. It has everything from your corny 80's films blended into a 90 minute duration thats so rushed it feels like it was 5 minutes long. The cgi in this film was awful. It was so fake i felt like i was watching someone play a video game, but not even playstation graphics. It was like the wii. It didn't seem like they finished the work on it. They just halfassed the job. The acting was atoricious besides GuyPearce, and another thing, apparently in lockout their is gravity in space, if you see it, you know what dumb scene im talking about. Anyways, everything was just horrible about this film. The only reason im giving it a 2 and not a 0 is because of Guy Pearce, he was hilarious, but that was the only positive i saw.

Sure, some special effects are cheap, sure some lines you've heard over and over again. But these days, this one is as good a b movie as it gets. This isn't Guy Pierce's best performance, but he gets the job done as an off the map cop that only does things his own way, tells jokes, gets punched (and punches) a lot and kick a lot of ass.

Pearce is terrific in his highly original and refreshing role - for him - but the \"bad guys\" weren't nearly interesting or threatening enough to make it work. It could have been more like a Die Hard film with better-drawn characters. And was one of the early car chases supposed to look like a videogame cut-scene?

Example - at one point Guy Pearce jumps off a high rise during a chase.  He ends up uninjured without a scratch, maybe just a little winded.  He endures so much physical abuse throughout the film but is like a cartoon character, he just keeps going.  The other thing about the film that is annoying is Joseph Gilgun, who plays the bad guy.  His acting is great, BUT I couldn't understand more than 5 words he said throughout the film.  He has a very thick Aussie accent.  He needed to clean up the accent a little for American audiences.  His brother in the film is also a bad guy and has an Aussie accent but you can easily understand him.  This wasn't a bad film but it had too many implausibilities to recommend."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Lockout is never meant to be a serious, Guy Pearce can do what the best he can with steroid and junk jokes from Luc Besson but well,  somehow it's work."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "In the later part of the 21st-century the worst criminals the planet has to offer are kept safely away from public in stasis aboard an orbiting prison known as MS: One.

It was a popcorn popping action movie that really worked it's hardest to fit itself together. It's nothing that new, and though it really only goes surface level, what else was there to expect?

The mystery of the case and the events that open the film are slowly dealt out, ending in a huge reveal that makes you really think. The two main villains are well-acted, with one being a sane man who wants to negotiate with the government, the other a psychopath who is really the worst humanity has to offer.

Almost."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "When I saw the trailer for Lockout back in 2012, I thought, \"oh, here we go again. Another CGI, messy, violent action movie with one liners and bad acting.\" Lockout proved a little bit of that to be true, but still exceeded my expectations.\r Lockout is a fun movie for a party night or a couple of bros hanging out, but its not one to take your girlfriend to---- unless she can take that kind of stuff!--- and is not for your grandma either. It mixes a smart, but somewhat sluggish script, with a surprisingly well-thought out story line, and gets a solid B Actioner; but this movie thinks too highly of itself for what it is. Sometimes, it caves into itself, overstepping its boundaries, and the product is an adrenaline rush: the bad kind. More like a kid running around after having too much candy. Again, this is only at parts of it. Most of the movie is decent.\r As awesome as ever, this movie has Guy Pierce, who has proved his talents as a character actor over and over again. From playing a geeky, by-the-books cop in L.A. Confidential, to an Irish evil-doer who wants to destroy the world in Iron Man 3. Now, he plays a bad-ass, flirty, lets-get-this-over-with man who was wrongfully convicted of Espionage against the U.S. He also needs a shave  He's offered his freedom by rescuing the president's daughter from a prison she was visiting that got taken over by the prisoners. Trouble arises when he gets there, obviously, since this is a MOVIE, and nothing is simple and/or seems to go right.\r I did, in fact, very much like one of the final scenes where they explained what happened to the whereabouts of the \"package\" that contained valuable information; the thing that got him arrested in the first place. I'm not gonna spoil it too much, but the way the writers played up the scene and its symbols was very creative. To find out what the hell I'm talking about, you'll have to see the movie (if you haven't already)! Overall, this movie is definitely worth a watch. Oh, and did I mention it takes place in 2079?\r HandHStudios Rating: 6.3/10\r Oblivion (2013/I)\rVisually Stunning,But With Some Flaws, 6 May 2013\r5/10\r *** This review may contain spoilers ***\r I debated whether seeing oblivion or Iron Man 3 the weekend I saw it. I regret my decision.\r Even though Oblivion isn't that bad  with its beautiful cinematography and visually stunning images  Iron Man would beat it any day, and it just seems kind of mainstream.\r Story was decent enough I guess, but there were some flaws in it and logic had to be suspended. In fact, at some scenes, i thought i was sitting in Inception! So, some of the flaws include: Morgan Freeman's character. This is the first (and hopefully last) time i will say this... Morgan Freeman was not right for this role, even though he did a good job.\r Plot holes.\r Too many silence scenes; no enough action scenes.\r and finally, illogical scenes and bad editing.\r Overall, this was a slightly too long movie that tried to be more than it was, with a mainstream story line, but very visually stunning cinematography."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "It\u2019s a fun entertaining movie and Pierce summons his best Bruce Willis.

It\u2019s well put together with the exception of the CGI, which looked pretty ropy particularly at the beginning of the film.

The ones that actually had the balls to come up with a story that is creative / ridiculous and doesn't have to make a lot of sense. Guy pierce was a great role. He really pulled off the new snake pliskin style character in his own way and I would love to see him do another role. The things I didn't like about the movie; was how a lot of scenes were to fast paced.. They never really give the viewer a chance to understand whats going on or just to have a break.

If you are looking for a realistic Sci Fi, you are out of luck with this one.  The movie expects you to believe that we have built a huge space prison hundreds of times bigger than the International space station using nothing but rocket technology and that orbital flights are commonplace using nothing but rockets.  That being said, Guy Pierce does a good job playing a like-ably unlikable character--- and the rest of the cast is pretty decent as well.  This would have been a good movie in a different setting, but the story and premise had more holes than the prison did after Snow (Guy Pierce) was done with it.   Still a good bet late night on Netflix."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "If you want a chilled out, easy to watch sci-fi action movie then I'd definitely recommend this.

The concept is great, the acting is solid, the characters aren't all so one-dimensional, and it's really entertaining. Guy Pearce did a great job. He kind of reminded me of a \"poor man's\" Mark Wahlberg. The problem came in with the lazy writing that created unbelievable plot development. Add to that the fact that the effects were terrible pretty much throughout the film and the movie goes from really good to just OK. So I guess if you want to see a halfway decent futuristic action movie, check it out."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Luc Besson is the Writer/Director of The Fifth Element and Taken. Usually when you sit down to watch one of his films, you're in for a treat. When he said he was making a new film that combined elements of both popular movies, I was excited, and then sorely disappointed. Lockout introduces us to a new kind of a prison, one that is in outer space, and holds it's prisoners in cryogenic stasis. The daughter of the U.S. President (Maggie Grace) was set to tour the facility, to make sure the prisoners are being treated fairly, when all hell breaks loose. Wanting to restore order with a minimal amount of casualties, the President sends in one man, his best C.I.A. operative, Snow (Guy Pearce), whose job it is to save the hostages. For starters this film is so full of cliques and references to other things that it almost becomes a farce of itself. Guy Pearce is the star and he was very good, however his character plays like John McClain in Outer Space. Snow is full of jokes and is this huge tough guy, who was almost a mirror image of Bruce Willis in Die Hard. The only thing missing was a catch phrase and lets all be thankful for that. Pearce is paired with Maggie Grace, who as in Taken, finds herself as a hostage once again. To her credit, she was a lot less whiny than in Taken and even fights back a little bit, but she basically played the same character that she always does. I don't know about you, but I have a hard time feeling sorry for a beautiful spoiled blonde girl who gets into trouble because she traveled to Europe or had to take on the cause of prisoners rights. Overall, there was a lot of action, but not much of a story to play on. Guy Pearce does a pretty good job, but Lockout is honestly a predictable, paper thin story, with special effects that aren't anything to write home about. It's another big budget film that tries to wow audiences with a unique setting and lots of explosions in the previews, but the only surprise here is that the usually reliable Luc Besson fails to deliver a worthwhile film."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "For me, Lockout is one of those odd guilty pleasures. It was probably far from the best film released during it's week of release, never mind the month or year. It's a straightforward, short, fast paced, guns blazing, one man action vehicle that doesn't make any attempts to be cleverer than it needs to be. Guy Pearce stands in for the likes of Russell, Seagal, Willis, Arnie or Sly as the likeable rogue protagonist.\r It's unusual to see Pearce play a genuine all action-hero but he seems to be enjoying himself delivering some of the most sarcastic one-liners in film history, courtesy of co-writer Luc Besson and directors Saint & Mather. In fact, Snow literally barely says anything at all other than acerbic barbs directed at either villains or his damsel in distress. The relationship between Snow and Emilie, and the situation they find themselves in, reminded me of that of Steven Seagal and Erika Eleniak in Under Siege.\r With a budget of $20M, Lockout is relatively low budget and almost B-movie like but if you can get past the occasionally ropey CGI, place tongue firmly in cheek and accept it for the guilty pleasure it is it's capable of satisfying that action movie itch you get from time to time.
