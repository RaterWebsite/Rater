Now to the movie: This movie is boring, unfunny, offensive to southerners, the actors had a pathetically fake southern accent, and the plot makes zero sense. I also didn't care about the main characters at all. I actually found the side characters more interesting being the construction workers former sister in law and daughter.

Either they were all badly done or they were expertly done compared to other movies, and that's why I hate them. But Oh my GOD I hate them.Then the plan. Look the Ocean's movies had plans as ridiculous and improbable as this one. So that's not the problem. But here the plan is unfolding as we see it. So when things go wrong we don't feel that bad, because we hardly know exactly what was planned and what was improvisation. Etc.Plus, the directing just like the frenesy of something that it supposed to be fun.

Not a single person laughed once in the theater, and experience that I see is not uncommon. The actors do a decent job with a bad script. Very bad script. Choppy. Rote. Expository. Unfunny. Familiar. Way too long. Just bad. I didn't walk out, but I did leave to go to the bathroom and didn't hurry to go back. So many plot holes. Heists have to make sense. This one does not. It is totally unbelievable and just logically impossible. So it doesn't work.But the worst thing is the 80 score on expert reviews and the 23:7 positive to negative ratio on user reviews. AM I TAKING CRAZY PILLS? I seriously believe some positive reviewers are paid or are bots. Many of the positive reviews just recite the plot and add generic comments like \"funny!\" I seriously think some people are cribbing from a press release from the studio to make $20-50. They have no individual comments. The negative reviews, OTOH, have personal stories about people walking out of the theater and are in very individual styles. Something is rotten here. If I had gone to see this based on the positive reviews I would have been p***ed. Be wary of the reviews of bad movies! Look for reviews written in unique voices.

It tries really hard to be quirky and cool, but the first half of the flick falls flat.

The acting is great and everyone from Channing Tatum, Adam Driver, Daniel Craig, and (surprisingly) Katie Holmes put on rather authentic southern accents, crisp cinematography and tight editing and direction, a trademark of Soderbergh, and a rather smart height film even if it's basically the redneck Oceans Eleven. And while there are laughs to be found, especially with some great character driven comedy, the jokes aren't as funny as they should be and often feels like it's relying too much on the audience being familiar with southern culture. Not to mention a lot of padding and filler to keep the movie a float, with plot threads that either feel unnecessary or just goes on for too long, and characters that feels like they are extended for too long (particularly Seth MacFarlane's character) or are just unnecessary (particularly Hillary Swank's character). Still this is a fun time at the theaters and I would recommend people seeing if they are interested."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Logan Lucky is an enjoyable, fun summer movie for if you want to sit back, relax, and have some good laughs.Acting: Tatum and Driver are fine in their roles, but Daniel Craig is definitely the stand-out, of course. It was nice to see him play a wild, unpredictable, enjoyable character, taking a step away from the countless cool and laid-back roles during his career. He was one of the best parts of the movie, as his performance was spectacular and was enjoyable to watch. Hilary Swank easily earned the worst performance. During the last 20 or so minutes, which I will talk about later, she was terrible, speaking in a monotone voice, being completely stiff, and having an annoying smirk. Seth MacFarlane, who I don't find terribly funny in the first place, didn't really make an impact on me. He was borderline annoying, and I didn't care for the whole subplot that he was involved in.Characters: Again, Daniel Craig as Joe Bang was easily the best performance and best character, just because he was interesting and cast well. All the other characters are fine. Nearly all of them are over-the-top or stereotypes, which I see many people dislike, but I think it worked with the sort of wacky style of the movie.Plot: The story was fine, despite there being a few plot holes here and there. The heist was intriguing to watch and easy to follow. The last 20 or so minutes drag on for way too long, however. In the final act of the movie, Hilary Swank plays a detective, looking into what happened during the heist. It isn't interesting, and feels completely disconnected from the movie, as only 1 of the (sort of) main characters is actually in it. It could have been scrapped from the movie and made it a bit better. Another subplot that wasn't too interesting was the racing one with Seth MacFarlane's character. It never really went anywhere or added anything to the main story, and again MacFarlane was a bit annoying. The story also would have been fine without this whole part. Also, this movie is different from Oceans 11 or other Soderbergh heist movies because it focuses more on the characters and their motivations. Tatum's character and others have a reason to be doing it, and there is more of a plot outside of the heist itself. I didn't mind this, as it was different than Oceans 11 and not just following the same path. This might have been why he put in the last 20 minutes, so the movie wouldn't just end right after the heist. Nevertheless, it could have been removed and been fine.Humor: Now, just because I found this movie to be particularly funny, especially in a few scenes that were hilarious, it doesn't mean you will. I found it to be consistently funny throughout, but others apparently didn't laugh once. Unless it's an Adam Sandler movie, I usually don't take people's words for it when they say it was or wasn't funny. But with other movies, I try to give them a chance. If someone else found it funny, good for them, but it doesn't mean me or the guy next to me in the theater will. I've also seen some reviews saying it was trying too hard to be a Coen brothers movie, but that's not the case at all. The Coens' movies are quirky while maintaining a dark element and incorporating dark humor. Logan Lucky is just wacky and not supposed to be taken extremely seriously.Script: Not the best, but I don't think it was trying to be. Was charming and pretty funny throughout (to me). Rebecca Blunt, who made her debut writing this movie, may or not be real, but whoever it was who wrote it did fine.Logan Lucky is a movie that you can expect to sit back and at least somewhat enjoy. Even if the jokes don't make you laugh or even chuckle, at the very least it is a somewhat respectable heist movie that isn't supposed to be too serious, at least in my eyes."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This a movie that is very subtle, but none the less it is perfect.

The fact it has 93% on rotten tomatoes is an offense to the entertainment industry and I am annoyed beyond belief I wasted my time and money on it."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Contrary to announced plans to quit making movies, director Steven Soderbergh is still here and producing one intelligent entertainment after another.This is his first attempt to cut studios out entirely and get by on own means.The man\u2019s had enough of \u201eOcean\u2019s\u201c after completing the trilogy but he likes an idea of a heist story. \u201eLogan Lucky\u201c is a working class version of this, which means less glamor and more people wearing blue jeans and eating at diners.As expected form Soderbergh project, there\u2019s a bunch of pretty cool faces doing their thang.Among others, we have Channing Tatum, Adam Driver, Katie Holmes, Daniel Craig (yes, the 007 himself), Dwight Yoakam, Seth MacFarlane, Jack Quaid, and Hilary Swank.Soderbergh and the team are still very good at putting movies together, everything in technical sense is competent. The result is too laid-back to become very gripping but it is certainly well oiled and tuned machine of a heist movie worth your time if you care about the subgenre.And there's enough little humorous details to smirk about, if you happen to notice them. Just like Soderbergh prefers it.I still think it could\u2019ve been shorter than 119 minutes, especially because some important plot parts are explained quickly rather than shown anyway. Also, there\u2019s no big amount of suspense or character development to justify this kind of duration.But maybe it\u2019s just me, dreaming of a perfect world where so many movies don\u2019t have to last two hours, so I have more time for other stuff too!PS The ony screenwriting credit goes to Rebecca Blunt who is suspected to be a pseudonym. Would be nice to know who\u2019s behind it. Maybe it\u2019s like Roderick Jaynes for Coen movies.

A roadside bar in West Virginia seems like a good place to find some interesting characters, but we never get to see any. A Nascar race seems like a perfect location for some fun heist hijinks, but instead we just get some cashiers and a few security guards. The main character's motivation is pretty weak: laid off for some uninteresting reason, not really struggling for money (his daughter seems well cared for), and he's not motivated by revenge. We meet a few characters that seem to hold promise, but they ultimately disappoint, and the film decides that there's just going to be one scene where we bring out everyone's quirks, then those quirks are absent from the rest of the film. A cursed high school quarterback, an Iraq War vet, two morally dubious religious converts, and an eccentric bomber sounds like a great setup with plenty of ways they could play against one another. But few of the fun scenes that you'd imagine ever materialize, and the long/uninspired editing doesn't do the film any favors. The film also has an awkwardly long epilogue, which is one of the few times that I've thought that a montage would have improved a film (rather than awkwardly lingering on characters for 20 unneeded minutes). There are a few genuinely good laughs and the heist is solid, but this ultimately feels like a film that needed a few more drafts of the script and a much more quirky editor."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "A bit of a disappointment, unfortunately.  A Steven Soderbergh-directed, Ocean's-style caper comedy transplanted to a blue-collar milieu in West Virginia and North Carolina, it is a film of fitful amusement and invention, but it is never as consistently fun as it clearly aims to be.  The film does have one enormous asset, though:  a delightful performance by a cast-against-type Daniel Craig.  He plays a taciturn, tattooed, Southern-accented pyromaniac and thief named Joe Bang.  Craig venturing beyond the suave, tough James Bond archetype is not exactly a revelation (consider, for example, his turn as murderer and In Cold Blood subject Perry Edward Smith in Infamous), but it is clear he relishes this absurd antihero, and his enjoyment becomes ours.  The rest of the cast, including Adam Driver and Channing Tatum as unexpectedly convincing brothers, is mostly fine, though none of their roles are nearly as compelling as Craig's.  Riley Keough, for instance, is sexy and spry as a Daisy Duke-style hairdresser sidekick, but the role never blossoms beyond the functional and ornamental.  There are two members of the ensemble I would gladly cut, however:  Seth MacFarlane, just bizarrely and uncomfortably miscast as a narcissistic British racing sponsor, and Hilary Swank, whose late-in-the-game appearance signals when the film seriously starts to feel overlong and out of fuel.Behind the camera, Soderbergh acquits himself decently on a scene-by-scene basis, shooting the action (much of it set in an industrial labyrinth beneath a speedway) with characteristic clarity and efficiency.  On a broader level, though, the film slips away from him to a degree.  His attempts to infuse the story with heart and soul\u2014the West Virginia locals' economic anxiety, one principal character's doting relationship with his daughter\u2014are rather limp, and the film becomes a noticeably long sit during its third act.  Said third act includes one of those montages in which the events of the heist play out again from another perspective, showing us who was misdirecting whom and what transpired in place B while we were focused on place A.

No it isn\u2019t the best heist movie you\u2019ll ever watch, it\u2019s overly long and adds too much backstory that drags the plot in unnecessary places. Oh great another scene with Tatum and his daughter simply there to highlight his money problems but he loves his daughter so it\u2019s ok for him to pull off this heist because deep down he\u2019s a good person. You know just in case you didn\u2019t pick up on that the first time. We know it\u2019s a heist movie so just get on with it.

But, it just so happens that this isn't the only thing \"Logan Lucky\" does well either. The film also spins feel-good, country bumpkin heist fun and intrigue at a decent clip, and excels smoothly on the performances of its supremely gifted cast, including a revelatory turn from one Daniel Craig as the aptly named \"Joe Bang.\" So, sure it's not as good as an \"Ocean's Eleven\" or \"Ocean's Thirteen,\" but it stands tall amidst the pantheon of heist films in general, and will probably end up being one of the better, unsung films of the 2017 altogether."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I can see why the audience reaction seems to reflect some disappointment with this film.

Channing Tatum is the most believable character who balances the rural type lifestyle with intelligence, whereas most of the other characters, funny though they may be, seem to overdo the Southern hillbilly schtick, which Hollywood almost always does, and can be somewhat insulting to those Southerners from Texas to Virginia down to Key West who do not live the \"assumed\" lifestyle we see here.    But that's a minor point, and the film does do well in Jimmy Logan's case as far as empathy and the hurt of losing a job and dealing with a divorce.    Otherwise, the big draw here for myself was to see Daniel Craig step out of his usual severe James Bond type mold, and he comes through brilliantly, having no difficulty making us believe he was truly from a backwater extremely poor West Virginia town.    For more comic relief we have his two bumbling hardcore redneck brothers in on the heist, and possibly the more insulting caricature of southern people in this movie.    Being from Arkansas and seeing it a second time because my wife can watch a movie she likes a million times, the audience didn't seem offended, and laughed a lot.    After all, if you can't laugh at yourself, you can't deal with much of anything.    Yes, we are from Dixie, but while I'm not a native, having spent my first 12 years in Iowa, I've been here a lot longer, 44 years and all my friends and family are here.    But that minor point aside, while \"Logan Lucky\" doesn't contain any big surprises, it does have its cleverness, humor, and decent story line to keep it entertaining.    Fans of the \"Ocean\" series will like it immediately, and those looking for a good chuckle will like the movie as well.    It is a bit long, and there is one plot hole I won't give away that even after two viewings I'm still trying to figure out, because it relies on an assumption on the viewer's part and doesn't explain for sure just what this certain part of the movie has to do with the rest.

Given that I was personally pretty disappointed with that film, I certainly hoped that it wouldn't serve as his swan song. Thankfully, it didn't, and he came back with a vengeance with this surprisingly funny deadpan caper comedy! Sure, the film may simply feel like a redneck 'Ocean's Eleven', with the premise and what not (the film even pokes fun at itself about that briefly towards the end), but the talented and studded cast with the likes of Channing Tatum, Adam Driver, Riley Keough, Seth MacFarlane in an almost unrecognizable role, Daniel Craig completely and brilliantly playing against type, and even a worthwhile cameo near the end, make this film all the more fun and a lot more easy to forgive the fact that it is indeed very much like a redneck 'Ocean's Eleven.' Overall, this was actually quite a bit more fun and humorous than I was anticipating, and served as one of the more surprisingly good films I've seen this year! Very good to have you back Soderbergh!"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Clever, fun, funny, charming, with a lot of detail and classic film-making touches. Just a solid movie with some bad accents but really good acting, spot-on casting, and topical satire and humor. Also, it is a rare movie that can lovingly cherish the same culture it is also lampooning, somewhat. Highly recommended; pleasantly surprised by this one."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "The funniest film of the year so far, Logan Lucky is a kind of redneck Ocean's 11, with even more originality and wit. Daniel Craig gives his best performance to date, as does Channing Tatum. Highly recommended."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Boring this movie is very bad and such a waste of time! Do not waste your money  on this movie! I repeat Do not waste your money  on this movie! Thanks"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Can we please start giving Channing Tatum more credit as an actor? I'm not saying the guy is Oscar worthy, but for goodness sake the man is working alongside Adam Driver here and at no point does it look like he has no business sharing the screen with such a soulful performer. Which to me says he's a bit more than the mediocre talent Hollywood only keeps around for the pretty face and hot body he brings to the table his detractors often try to paint him as.Anyways, this is a southern fried heist flick with a comedic slant. One where the seemingly simple minded and down on their luck rednecks come up with a shockingly complex and intelligent plan to rob a motor speedway while delivering plenty of laughs along the way. It's never an outright laugh riot in the traditional sense even though it will get you to guffaw at times. That's because the humor is most often delivered in a straight-faced, downright deadpan manner. The most cartoonish aspect of the whole thing is Seth MacFarlane's character, making you realize just how much the genre tends to rely on the absurd or loud to get a reaction from the audience. Logan Lucky on the other hand is funny due to the naturalistic cleverness of its material.There's also a heart to the whole thing that makes it easy to get invested in the characters and their schemes. That's because the cast are playing a bunch of average, luckless southern joes with charming down-home sensibilities. The lead of which is trying to do the best for his daughter and others close to him after losing his job. You want to see them succeed so you'll sit on the edge of your seat during every close call in-between the chuckles. Think of it like a lighter, fluffier version of Hell or High Water that's just as enjoyable."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "One of the best movies this year!  Easily, unarguably!  Rotten Tomatoes has it at 93%In a day and age when I can sit at home and for hardly 20-50$ a month, I can daily consistently watch the greatest movies, TV shows and cinema of all-time...    I can sit right there on my couch, with my humongous HDTV and absorb cinema at any time I desire, it is rare these days that I will go to a movie theater to see 'what's playing'.When I saw Daniel Craig as Joe Bang and Kylo Ren with a prosthetic arm/hand, and all then tossed into a NASCAR bank heist?  haha I knew this movie would either be HORRIBLE or it would be AMAZING.  Logan falls into the latter.  As is with most top-notch cinema, there really is no way for me to explain 'what' makes this movie so 'great', but if you watch this flick and you do not 'get it', you need to remodel your cinematography paradigm."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "You can keep \"Baby Driver,\"this was a far superior film. Great performances, especially from Adam Driver and Channing Tatum. Think of it as a redneck version of \"The Town\""}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I'm giving this movie a 7 because it's a pleasant romp and I found sufficiently entertaining to watch it all the way through despite the fact that I have no love for 1) hillbillies, 2) the South, 3) southern twangs and drawls, and, 4) fictional characters which come off as exceedingly ignorant and stupid.Another reviewer commented that Logan Lucky is more clever than you might expect and that is certainly true."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This movie was awesome, this is what a new school heist flick is supposed to be, you can keep your Drive & Baby Driver, just keep giving me kickars movies like this and I'll be happy.  Recommended."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Great movie! Had a blast watching this one. The movie was extremely enjoyable from beginning to end and was absolutely hilarious at moments. I love it took the more smaller subtle comedy parts rather than the all out huge lough out loud moments. Channing Tatum, Adam Driver and Daniel Craig all give great performances, but the stand out Daniel Craig. He had me laughing from beginning to end along side Adam Driver who also had great comedic timing. The story was fun, but wasn't necessarily amazing. I felt the chemistry is what makes the movie so enjoyable and hilarious and some memorable scenes."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Logan Lucky was a very fun and surprising movie. The actors were all amazing. They brought a very special tone to their character. The story is well written with savoury dialogues. The movie is remnant of the Ocean Eleven's heist movies in terms of how the stories is showed. This isn't an action movie of course, but it's so well done. The soundtrack is great and fits perfectly. Overall a very charming, funny film. Be aware that this is done with south US accents. So for my part, I was happy to have subtitles but it wasn't too bad. I give it a 78%. Definitively the best Tatum performance."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Logan Lucky is a hilarious, fun-filled time with characters that are an absolute blast to be around. Daniel Craig turns in his best performance outside of the 007 franchise and Steven Soderbergh proves why he's the king of heist films."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "If I could give this an 8.5, I would, so I rounded up to a 9 as I feel this is a movie that deserves so much more credit than it has gotten. Easily one of my favourites of the year thus far, this movie is basically redneck Ocean's Eleven and I mean that in the best way possible. This movie is very cliche and predictable, but I had a hell of a lot of fun watching it, especially since it was better than what I expected it to be."}], "recommendations": ["lucky_number_slevin", "seven_psychopaths", "spenser_confidential", "rocknrolla", "mortdecai", "the_dilemma", "pitch_perfect_2", "the_nice_guys", "jumanji_the_next_level", "deadpool_2", "the_gentlemen", "inherent_vice", "tag", "snatch", "burn_after_reading", "the_guardian", "tusk", "hancock", "the_king_of_staten_island", "this_means_war", "american_ultra", "the_cobbler", "keeping_up_with_the_joneses", "spy", "identity_thief"]}
