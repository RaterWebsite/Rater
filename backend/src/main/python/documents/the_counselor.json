Many will see the generally unfavorable reception towards this film and write it off without the blink of an eye.\r Now I am in no way saying that my opinion is absolute (it so clearly is not), and I would also like to point out that I do not throw around 10-ratings lightly.\rThis film is, without a doubt, one of the most brilliant films I have seen in years.\rRidley Scott is an artist with a 'true vision', and I will not argue that it requires one to be on a certain wavelength in order to perceive this vision (I do not mean to sound pretentious).\rEvery inch of Cormac McCarthy's dialogue is profoundly thought-provoking and unknowingly exposing,\rand the performances are brilliant to the point of the cast's A-list status coming off as a mere coincidental detail. Fassbender, Pitt, Diaz, Bardem, and Cruz all exhibit the same fearless resolve as Scott on the other side of the lense.\rDespite common criticism of the film's 'lack of cohesion' or 'identity confusion', I assert that this film's self-identity is actually stronger than most. Those who cannot recognize this cannot see the forest for the trees. Those who are not familiar with a more 'Art-house' approach to film-making/story-telling will most likely end up alienated. This movie makes no attempt to ease viewers into its twisted and bizarrely real world, and that is ENTIRELY intentional.\r Again, I do not mean to sound aggressive towards those many who dislike this film.\rI simply wanted to present my personal appreciation for this film which I consider monumental, and for those intrigued but disenchanted by the negative reception to persevere until they can form their own opinion."

      "text": "There was nothing for me to like about this movie. The story evolves around a Counsellor and the people surrounding him. For reasons unbeknown to us he decides to go into the drug business, and pseudo-intellectual existential dialogues between the protagonists ensue, with the main focus being on greed and how sexual everything appears to them. Cheetahs chasing jackrabbits is sexual, a yellow Ferrari is so sexual that Diaz' character decides to make-out with it (yes, you read that correctly). The Counsellor is constantly being counselled on life and it's meaning by philosophical drug-dealers and cartel members. The tediousness of these overdrawn, often repetitive and rather self-indulged exchanges make the film feel so ill paced. The chemistry between the two main couples (Fassbender-Cruz, Bardem-Diaz) was non-existent. The characters are hardly developed. Were we suppose to empathise with the Counsellor? The acting was NOT good. The ultimate attraction to this film, for me, was the cast who in it's majority has seldom - if ever - let me down. And yet, here, even they were, to put it mildly, not on top form. The emphasis had been given on the aforementioned dialogue, something that was more obvious when the main plot of the film became increasingly convoluted and thus hard to follow. At the end all I felt was content that it was over. This is, unfortunately, the worst film I've seen this year."

Amazing interiors\", :\"fast cheetahs\", \"Fassbinder licking muffin of Penelope Cruz who complains that it's dirty\", \"Queer Bardem\", Diaz screwing the Ferrari\" \"Pitt loses his head due to idiotic device\"... What a sham! But the worst part is dialogues. A good movie talking should do three things: move forward the plot, explore the characters, elicit some emotions. Here you have long imbecile speeches which try to pretend sexy, philosophic or smart. EVERY single person speaks as if they majored at ancient Greek literature. My god, what happened to good screenwriters? Studios should give the process back to independent producers, otherwise, in 5 years, people will go the cinemas just to eat some popcorn and play bowing"

I never thought that a movie made from the legendary Ridley Scott could fall down this path. Long story short, \"The Counselor\" truly suffers with its script. It doesn't know what it is. It makes the actors say a bunch of mumbo jumbo and makes the grisly violence seem less appealing to the source material it's given. Now I don't hate the movie, but there's something seriously wrong with this story. Its one thing, then its another. It's like they're trying to pull an Inception on me. And the movie is only about drug trafficking!! I don't know, but what I do know is that, you'll get sucked into a mindless and grisly film or you'll absolutely devour the crap out this confusing and off-setting story. Overall, it has its merits, but suffers in screenplay, which makes everything else suffer. I give it a C."

From the trailer, cast, director, synopsis etc you are probably expecting a high octane, on the edge of your seat thriller, with a strong plot line and characters you can love or hate. Sorry but it does not give that at all. This simply is a self-indulgent film (self-indulgent by the writer), with actors badly delivering unintelligible lines of philosophic dialogue with neither rhyme nor reason as to how they got there and what their motives are. This is the sort of thing you would expect to have to sit through, not too willingly, when you have a very good friend who is taking screenplay classes and has to do an obscure showcase. Most students, if not all, refrain from applying a Hollywood budget, getting Ridley Scott to direct and having Brad Pitt et al in these showcases though and maybe McCarthy should have thought twice about having his screenplay debut in such a fashion and kept to the more traditional avenue of a few friends in a small theatre. I am sure his friends would have said nice things about it but I can't think of one."

This is coming from a gamer, in fact I enjoy the violent ones, even the most violent and gory ones. Hell I was in a better mood after watching \"A Serbian Film\" than when this movie's credit's rolled.

      "text": "In 2007, Michael Bay created a mega, summer movie blockbuster event that brought some incredible advances in special effects, a slew of unnecessary sequels and most importantly, made famous the incredibly sexy, sweaty grease-monkey character Mikaela Banes, also knows as Megan Fox. If there is anything Michael Bay did right in that film, was give audience members as well as pop-culture enthusiasts one of the most memorable cinematic stills since Marilyn Monroe in 1954\u2032s The Seven Year Itch. Leaning on the sizzling hood of Sam Witwicky\u2019s 1976 Chevrolet Camaro\u2019s hood, allowing the heat from the engine to soak Mikaela\u2019s body with sweet sweat, Bay created eternal movie magic with that iconic scene. Since then, audiences, as well as critics alike, never thought that the day would come when an overly  sexual image involving a car would ever come. Oh, it came!\r The only difference between Diaz\u2018s Malkina\u2019s outrageous car scene and Fox\u2018s iconic heated scene is that, Diaz and company wish they had as good a movie as Transformers on their hands and a film that people will actually care to watch and recommend, and that\u2019s putting it nicely.\r The Counselor seemed to have no advising or counseling on it at all, because director Ridley Scott and company deliver what is surely going to be one of the worst decisions in their careers in a long time. What looked like a thrilling game of cat and mouse, quickly becomes a dry, careless piece of gorgeous snuff.\r The Counselor follows, well, the counselor (Michael Fassbender) as he navigates the waters of his first ever, illegal and immoral business venture of drug trafficking from Mexico across the United States boarder. That is pretty well everything you need to know and everything that is really told. Just like the lack to give a name to the lead, The Counselor is a cold, informal and perplexing film of too many characters and not enough explanation or purpose.\r The Counselor shows the relationship between himself and his gorgeous wife Laura (Penelope Cruz), his relationship with people in the underworld including Westray (Brad Pitt) a middle man between professionals and the cartels, Reiner (Javier Bardem) a man of means, and Malkina (Cameron Diaz) the lavish girlfriend of Reiner. Other than that, things go from bad, to worse, in both the narrative of the film, and the film itself.\r Lacking any real storyline or empathetic characters, The Counselor serves as an ill-advised example of the power within Hollywood. Following in the footsteps of other complete disaster ensemble films like this year\u2019s Movie 43 and The Coen Brother\u2019s 2008 tragedy Burn After Reading, the film serves no purpose other than Diaz\u2018s amazing showcase of acrobatics, sensuality and unexplained perversion.\r The film itself is a stylized and beautifully shot piece of work. Sadly, pieces of art share more of an emotional response than this film does. The film is flooding with lost scenes, pathetic foreshadowing and unflinching action/reaction shots.\r One of the most noticeable disappointments of The Counselor is its script. Acclaimed author Cormac McCarthy is a recognized and respected writing force. So many of the most striking narrative feature pieces of the last decade, including No Country For Old Men and The Road, have used McCarthy\u2018s work as source material and enhanced the characters and narrative of McCarthy\u2018s narrative worlds. In his first venture as feature screenwriter, McCarthy overcompensates with nonsense,  directionless and often sleepy dialogue. I\u2019m unsure if McCarthy was pulling inspiration from Shakespeare or Hemingway, but instead of delivering on precise, metaphorically driven, analogical monologues and conversations between characters, McCarthy simply loses his audience and instead allows his talented actors to give long-winded, spoken word lullabies.\r Every so often, there comes a movie that really makes me scratch my head and wonder how and why all the talented individuals involved could possibly sign on to a movie like this. The Counselor is well on its way to being one of the worst movies of 2013. Strangled with boredom that even scenes of decapitation couldn\u2019t possibly help make it even a bit interesting, The Counselor is a failed attempt for everyone involved but Diaz. Diaz will surely be remembered for years to come for her scene atop a bright yellow Ferrari, a vacant golf course and a priceless face made by Bardem, who encompasses the feeling of the whole movie, with one facial expression. Disbelief is the best way to describe it, or gynecological, if that even makes sense, because nothing in this film attempts to make sense. This film is in desperate need of some professional help."

The script is indescribably terrible  the dialogue is stilted, wordy, pompous, unnatural, shallow, unrealistic and pointless, and it manages to explain too much and explain too little, miraculously, all at the same time. Perhaps with better direction and editing the plot (which is actually fairly simple) would have made a bit more sense but at times you will likely still struggle to follow what's happening because the scenes are put together so poorly and the script introduces new characters at random.  This is a movie that gives off the impression, at first glance, of being intelligent. You'll get to hear speeches that draw on the many worlds intepretation of choice and the potential lack thereof, meaningfulness, etc. from unlikely sources. Having majored in philosophy I found them superficial and insulting. If I didn't have a background in philosophy, I would merely have found them preechy and pointless, I'm guessing.  The writing was stylistic but yet tried to be conversational and just failed in every way conceivable.\r There are a couple decent action sequences and a cool murder scene at the end but the characters are lifeless or caricatures of interesting characters because the writing is laughably abysmal.  This movie is a complete and utter failure, and I have a great attention span, have liked movies with little to no plot and was not expecting a suspense filled thriller.  This was just a complete turd.  I'm guessing what happened is that no one had the courage to tell McCarthy that his script was terrible or someone thought it was deep (even though it isn't) and greenlighted this movie.

I was on a date and had to work to keep from laughing because I thought it would come across as arrogant. She's just not capable of delivering complex, philosophic dialog in a believable way. Afterward, and I think in the moment too, I kept comparing that scene with the last scene from No Country for Old Men and Tommy Lee Jones' monologue. I think maybe Ridley Scott thought we'd be too busy fixated on a very sexy Diaz to notice the difference in quality.\r She played the animal really well. Did we have to have her hump a car though? I mean she lives with leopards and has her own leopard spots. We get it. She's the only thing that can survive in the drug trade--an animal.\r But I think what hurt the most was wasting Javier Bardem on an idiot character who 1) consistently and genuinely claims to not know anything of substance while obviously knowing enough to live in the lap of luxury, and 2) spouts McCarthy's (in this film frequently turgid) lines with his trademark talent...which here contrasts so badly with everything else we observe about his character that we reject both the character and the lines as absurd caricatures of McCarthy's writing.\r Waste of good film!"

By the half-way point,or sooner,you will have figured out who's good,bad,or just stupid. Also,almost every character gets their turn to wax philosophic. Even the owner of a broken down hole in the wall bar shares his lugubrious outlook on life. And lastly,I know movies like to drop in the title of the show periodically if it's appropriate,and counselor is a popular euphemism for attorney, but the word \"counselor\" is used so often it borders on ludicrous.

This is one of the few movies I actually felt bad for the talent involved.  The dialogue is just so terrible.  Particularly every conversation has some awkward self-conscious feel to it or just some random chit chat about women and how men cant understand them.  The only scenes that I felt worked were the opening scene in the bedroom and the conversation the counselor has with the main drug boss near the end.  Everything else is this dry philosophical edge.  When things finally get going a bunch a stuff happens and its really not as compelling as it set up to be.  The cameos are terrible too, they have no meaning what so ever.  I knew going in it wasnt a well reviewed movie but, I wanted to see it for myself.  I was surprised people talked so much in it, cause in Mcarthy's literature he can say a lot without really saying much.  This one had me running for the border...i mean the exit."

The only intelligent message of the film is obscured and is at best one that I hope isn't true for the sake of mankind. What has happened to our culture and to values? Some of the acting was good. What a waste. And what's with Cormac McCarthy and his twisted mind? What kind of brain thinks of such killing devices as in this film? Yuck."

Please explain me!!!\r Well, I went to the premiere and I was disgusted after the first 40 seconds. Javier Bardem was the only one who tried to save tha movie, but he actually didn't. All the cast was lost. The worst movie of 2013, the worst movie of McCarthy, a usual film of Ridley Scott(meaning on how the film was directed).\rDon't see it!!! Save your money!!!"

      "text": "I can quite understand why some will not take favor with The Counselor; one's who can only see what's put right in front of them. The mystical Cormac McCarthy presents some pieces and expects, demands his audience to pay close attention and then decide exactly what happened. Just like most of his characters we are only shown so much, but certainly enough to know up from down and right from wrong. A great thought provoking film, which I admit is one of my favorite types of films. I hate leaving a cinema knowing all I will ever know about a film. It's a shame great films like this, one's that leap far away from the mundane can only be appreciated by some while others expect the mundane and are thus disappointed by an 'outside the box' presentation. Outside the box is what you should crave!!\r The Counselor is sharp, stylish cinema that cuts out all the crap and delivers only what it needs to & the rest is up to you."

      "text": "I\u2019ve seldom seen published reviews of a film that have so misunderstood a film.  Banging on THE COUNSELOR as a failed thriller is like disparaging a hat for not being a shoe.\r THE COUNSELOR announces what it is, early on and self-referentially  not a thriller but a moral fable, a cautionary tale  and then proceeds to deliver just that, impeccably.  No hair-raising car chases, no miraculous escapes, no ingenious last-minute victory for the hero, and thank god for it.\r Austere in its point of view, anti-naturalistic by design, and florid in its dazzlingly tawdry material surfaces, this story moves toward its inevitable outcome without missing a beat.  In essence, it says don\u2019t trifle with evil, guy\u2026don\u2019t even.  Because evil will answer your invitation, will visit its tragic dance upon you.  Here, watch it destroy you in a cold torrent of pain.\r Scott and McCarthy deliver this excellent work on their own terms and within their own parameters, no hedging, no apologies.  The plot is always two steps ahead of the audience, so pay attention please.  The dialogue, which has elsewhere been quoted with jeers, actually plays magnificently.  Along the way are some amazing performances, Fassbender as, fundamentally, an innocent looking for a fast, casual score, Diaz as a devastated soul, Pitt as a candidly self-aware crook.  And of course the ever inventive and brilliant Javier Bardem as the sybaritic \u2018mastermind\u2019 with a stripe of stupid running through him.\r If you merely want someone to root for, go to a ball game.  If you want fast food, look elsewhere.  Scott and McCarthy serve up a coherent fictional world to which the viewer must simply surrender.  This film will last and be revisited again and again, long after other routine thriller fare has been lost and forgotten in the streaming video graveyards."

      "text": "Some of Cormac McCarthy's books have made successful movies (No Country for Old Men, The Road), but this time pens his own screenplay and it's a talky, tedious mess. Novels can afford to take time to develop characters and, in McCarthy's case, wax philosophical, but a movie needs some brevity and this one is lacking. Michael Fassbender plays an attorney who gets embroiled in a drug deal, but he's as confused as the viewer: Who are all these people and what is their relationship to him and the deal? With almost non-stop chatter, you'd think this would be clear, but it's just a confusing muddle.You'd think director Ridley Scott would know better, but he just adds a stylish edge."

      "text": "Not a good movie. Don't get lured by the big names attached to this movie. While their acting is actually good, especially Fassbender who is quite convincing, the [lack of] story is embarassing and quickly becomes an excuse for an escalating and gratuitous violence. Then, there's the meaningless philosophical exchanges between the characters, trying to make you believe you are watching a great movie.\rGoods: Michael Fassbender & Javier Bardem. The scene where the truck gets washed, repaired, repainted after a shooting by men and women who \"just do their job\" and clean the blood everywhere, as if nothing serious had happened. Bad: pretty much everything else, amongs other the robotic acting by Cameron Diaz, who still tries to convince she is attractive. Ugly: violent and bloody scenes just for the sake of it (that scene with Brad Pitt' character being killed in London is just ridiculous)."

I could not bring myself to watch the movie past the 15 minute mark. It looks like the producers made their initial investment back and came few bucks on top thanks to Brad and that's all that matters, I guess. I am sure there are some idiots out there who will give it a four or five stars and call it an \"art\", but believe me there is NOTHING artistic about this piece of crap. Poor acting and vulgar opening scene does not qualify as art. I understand there is a scene with Cameron Diaz rubbing her kooch against the Ferrari !? This is why you gave it four or five stars, you moron(s) ? Go rent a porn ! I, also, read that director's brother jumped of the bridge. Now I know why."

      "text": "The Counselor is one of the best films I have seen in years--mesmerizing, ethereal, even captivating in spite of the theme.  Critics expecting, or insisting on, an action-adventure genre picture where everything is neatly solved at the end were disappointed, and responded hyperbolically.  The film will fail at the box office in this country, but it doesn't fail as a film.  Here are a few random thoughts, in no particular order:\rFirst, the Counselor himself is not an innocent, naive, or likable figure (except in his relationship with Laura).  He is from the beginning a morally compromised player--as we can see in his arrogance, in his dealings with women, with Reiner, and with the mysterious figure who gets him to El Jefe, and even in his odd question to Westray about whether he has slept with Malkina.  Now that everything in his life seems perfect, he is driven to destroy it, piling on debts that put his \"back against the wall\" and \"force\" him to get involved with the drug deal.  In reality he is driven to annihilation by something inside him.  (I thought of Freud, Civilization and its Discontents).\rSecond, we know very little about the drug deal and how it falls apart, and that little we do know is given to us in bits and pieces.  We are exactly in the place of the protagonist, who also is surrounded by a menace he does not fully understand.  It is a very uncomfortable place.  In the end there is nothing he can do, except aimlessly travel and plead.  By the time he realizes he is in trouble, it is already too late.  The idea that human individual action may be useless is one that is hard to accept.  We want to see the hero solve things, and we aren't going to get that here.\rThird, the dialogue is gorgeous and endlessly quotable, just as the film itself is beautifully shot, edited, visualized.\rFourth, the sequence that ends the life of Westray is one of the most chilling horror scenes I have ever watched.  It is described for us early on; we feel the suspense as Westray is followed, and then we are left to watch as the horrific scene, whose ending we already know, plays out.\rFifth, and finally, the performances are first rate.  Pitt, Bardem, Cruz, Diaz, Blades, Perez, Leguizamo, and others are at the top of their form.  Fassbender in particular is a stand-out for his ability to create a character from a sparsely written role.  The best scene, in retrospect, is his phone conversation with El Jefe, photographed through his dirty windshield.  El Jefe gently but ruthlessly tells him that it is over and there is nothing for him to do.  Fassbender's pleas--\"Maybe we could meet someplace\"; \"Can you help me?\" are, like all of his dialogue, almost banal (in contrast to the glorious words of the rest) but he is able to use that contrast to create an unforgettable character.  We don't know what happens to him at the end.  It would almost be too much to bear.\rI'm sorry that this film is not doing well at the box office in the US.  My only consolation is that this film--like Vertigo, Touch of Evil (which it resembles in some ways), or Blade Runner itself--will get its reevaluation, and be seen as the classic that it is."

      "text": "The Counselor will leave many mystified  even those who enjoy it. The story envelops rather than unspools, a guttural experience. As Scott stages the confined action, bouncing from location to location like a Pinter play's moving sets, the musical score pulsates with dread. In one scene, a nameless assailant strings a steel wire across a desert road, intending to slice a speeding biker who will eventually appear. That's the movie in one note: taught, prophetic, and hushed. We don't have our finger on why this is happening, but we can feel what's coming. We know it's grisly. We can't look away."
