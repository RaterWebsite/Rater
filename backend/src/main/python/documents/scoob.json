There isn't a lot of mystery solving or spooky situations. This is more of a superhero adventure. Warner Bros. (which now owns Hannah-Barbera) is trying to start a shared HB universe. So they were more interested in doing a movie using HB characters from more than one show. Scooby was basically chosen as the first lead because he's the most prevalent character.Shaggy (voiced by SNL/Last Man on Earth's Will Forte) and Scooby (voice-acting veteran Frank Welker) spend a lot of the show working with other HB characters in order to push the shared universe concept. The rest of the Mystery Inc. characters only play supporting roles. I would've preferred the main gang in more of this, but I give the movie credit. This isn't the only SD show or film to focus on just the duo, but I felt that this was the only one where they managed to make it work. (That's right Reluctant Werewolf fans, come at me.)This may not be a perfect representation of what Scooby-Doo is, but as a movie by itself it's an entertaining children's film. It doesn't have the most ambitious story, but it's fun and upbeat. (I ended up watching this twice.) The best part is the jokes, there are a lot of funny lines.There are a lot of moments where I felt myself thinking that the movie could have been stronger. The setup in the first few minutes feels rushed. The movie offers an obstacle to Scooby and Shaggy's friendship and confidence, which feels formulaic and forced. However, when it comes to their and other characters' emotional moments, the movie nails it perfectly; no complaints.Some of the voice actors felt miscast. (Jane the Virgin's Gina Rodriguez sounds too old to be Velma.) Others were good, but couldn't quite make the dialogue pop. The MVP in this is Jason Isaacs, who played Lucius Malfoy in Harry Potter, as Dick Dastardly. He completely encaptures the feel of old-timey mustachoid villainey.The animation is cheaper than say a film from Disney, Dreamworks, or Pixar. (Given how their attempt to create a DC shared universe didn't pan out, I can't blame the WB for being financially cautious. Even the director Tony Cervone was brought from within house.) That having been said, design-wise the entire thing looks great. There is a distinctive colorful look to this. Several characters get redesigned. I know some people don't like it when they mess with characters' classic looks, but I really, really liked how everyone appeared. Really, the design team knocked it out of the park.I know my jaded adult mind has been critical of this. Plus this isn't my, or probably many other adult SD fans, idea of the ideal Scooby film. (Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island is still the high bar to judge by.) But, I'm pretty sure kids won't have any complaints from this. Plus, I think this won't bug parents if their children rewatch. This is a perfectly decent way to spend your time."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "It's awesome the characters be a personality perfect and this movie needy for we back to room house in family and the this generations know good 90s television"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "It\u2019s a cute movie.

Soon after this we get introduced to falcon and co and things quickly went downhill for me as it became apparent that this production is trying so desperately to instantly connect with a large audience making its main characters dab and seems afraid to stick with the original characters for long instead shamelessly shoehorning in more hanna barbara characters.You even get to hear the term 'toxic masculinity'.... In a cgi remake of a beloved 70s animation..... I guess nothing is truly sacred in the entertainment business anymore. I came for the scoob but was left with gender politics and massive magical/action sequences featuring knock off minion like cg robit madness. On the plus side the visual presentation looked excellent on uhd hdr setup.

On a serious note, why is Simon Cowell in a Scooby-Doo movie? I thought early 2000 references died years ago.The only redeeming quality in the movie is Jason Isaacs as Dick Dastardly, but that's really it.Every decision the film makers made for this movie was the absolute worst. The animation was bad and at times looks unpolished. How this new version handles the characters such as the old gang was painfully insulting. The Scooby gang are separated for a massive portion of the movie and we instead focus on this superhero-like story line, because superhero movies are popular right now. The voice acting was pretty terrible and how the movie applies modern technology into the story was straight up embarrassing.It's a factory-made movie produced by a bunch of old boomers that try so hard to be hip for the modern youth, but it will age like sour milk.I thought we would get a Scoob movie in the same vein as 'The Peanuts Movie' back in 2015.

This movie is the first instalment in the planned Hanna-Barbera shared universe. Originally, the movie would have release in the big screen if it weren\u2019t for the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, the movie goes straight to video on demand.The movie begins with Shaggy (Forte) meeting a stray dog, whom he named the dog, Scooby-Doo (Welker). Soon, they become close friends. During Halloween, they meet Fred Jones, Daphne Blake and Velma Dinkley where they catch a costumed thief who have been stealing many electronic devices. This inspires them to work together as a team known as Mystery Inc.Ten years later, a British entrepreneur decides to do business with Mystery Inc as its investor but he would not invest if Shaggy and Scooby are part of it because he claims that friendship is a weakness. Angered by his words, Shaggy and Scooby leave and hang out in a bowling alley where they were attack by small robots called Rottens.They were later rescue by the Blue Falcon, Dynomutt and Dee Dee Sykes in a nick of time, whom they told them those robots work for a super criminal named Dick Dastardly (Isaacs). Dastardly wants Shaggy and Scooby for reasons unknown but it has something to do with the three skulls of Cerberus, which he has been stealing them. Meanwhile, Fred along with Daphne and Velma soon tracks down Shaggy and Scooby and they work on their own in solving the mystery to find out what is Dastardly\u2019s plan.I may not a big fan of Scooby-Doo franchise but Scoob! is a fun and enjoyable movie to watch. The animation and character design are very well done and the voice acting are great. There are lots of funny moments and the humours are not weak and lousy. Although none of the original cast of the previous Scooby-Doo movies (except Frank Welker) returned to voiced their respective characters, everyone in this movie still delivered their best performance. As for Will Forte, he managed to gave his best voice acting for Shaggy. At least, it is a good thing that Shaggy does not sound terrible. However, I wish Matthew Lillard would reprise his role. It would have been great service for hardcore fans of the franchise.While I enjoyed watching the movie but the story in this movie have some flaws. As this is the first instalment in a shared universe, the movie used up too many characters outside of Scooby-Doo franchise. Because of this, Scoob! became more a Hanna-Barbera crossover movie instead of a Scooby-Doo movie. The movie should have focus on mystery solving stories like how every other Scooby-Doo TV shows and movies have done previously. Honestly, the movie should have been full origin story with Scooby-Doo characters only. The crossover stories should have been save for future instalments. One thing good about this movie is Scoob! did not go overboard with setting up some future instalments like the 2014\u2019s The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and 2017\u2019s The Mummy.For those who are fans of Hanna-Barbera, you probably will enjoy watching this movie but those who are Scooby-Doo fans, you may or may not like this movie. For the time being, we can only wait and see if this movie will be success. If it does, there might be a sequel to this movie or more Hanna-Barbera movies will be made. If not, this will the only instalment in Hanna-Barbera shared universe. Only time will tell. In the nutshell, this is a mediocre movie. Not too good but it is not too bad either. You can give this movie a shot if you are curious."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Se eu fosse descrever SCOOB! numa palavra diria \u201cindeciso\u201d porque n\u00e3o faltaram hist\u00f3rias para contar, certo ?!
