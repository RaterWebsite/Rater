      "text": "A Great Mexican produced movie, based in Mexico and deeply entrenched with Mexican views and ideas and with what we grew up seeing sadly given low marks by Mr. Malcolm, Mr. Rechtshaffen and Mr. Koehler. Those last names sure do sound Latin to me and I'm sure they have a full understanding of movies that don't star Tom Cruise. In a nutshell, go watch the movie and enjoy the visuals, the acting and the story line for what they are Great!"
