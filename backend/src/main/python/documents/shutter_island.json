This film is one of the best films I have seen recently. So intense, thrilling and it keeps you to the edge of your seat. From prologue to the epilogue it's so perfect. What can you expect more from a director of his caliber.!!!!!"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This movie is just plain GOOD. Simple. Let me also be the one to say that these other people who are giving bad reviews, well they mostly do not have a good IQ or any knowledge of psychology. These people were probably just hoping for a scary movie. Because after the trailer, I was expecting the same. But I still enjoyed the movie even though I didn't get scared at all (because it's not a scary movie) is because I am a college student with a good IQ and understand of psychology and how the brain works. I also know what psychologists do and how they used to treat patients in the old days (hence why the setting is 1954 and not now). You don't even need to KNOW anything about psychology to appreciate this movie. Just a simple curiosity of how the brain works is a good start. I love action movies and scary movies but I also like INTELLIGENT movies and that's what this is. Those of you who say you saw the twist coming, I say bullcrap. Maybe some of y'all did but the twist doesn't take place until there is like 20 or less minutes left in the movie and the whole first half doesn't leave any clues as to what is coming. If you are an intelligent person or a curious person to how we humans function and our mind works, this is a GREAT movie. Great acting and great plot. I love psychology or most of it atleast and like I said, I am a college student who enjoys intelligent movies and not just the ones where there is plenty of violence, comedy, and sex. So those of you who gave it bad reviews, I'm sorry I have to say it but y'all are probably just dumb kids or dumb people in general who don't have a clue how you even function as a human being. Watch the movie and tell me if I'm wrong."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I just think that this movie is beautiful. No slow spots for its entirety. The story itself and the ending are not the main points of the movie. The main point is emotional journey of the main character and his inner change."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Not Scorsese's best film, but it might be one of DiCaprio's best performances. It's a very good looking film and intense feeling to it all. The music does a really good job in setting a tone, **** work comes to mind. Leo lights up the screen as Teddy Daniels, a  US Marshall investigating the disappearance of a patient at this really sketchy hospital. I think multiple viewings of the film gives it justice."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Scorsese and DiCaprio were born to work together! Shutter Island is brutal and twisted, yet brilliant right down to the core. From the first shot of the film to the closing credits, error was nowhere to be found. The music encompased the element of fear and excitement, perfectly. The beautiful yet gritty cinematography left you on the edge of your seat for the next shot. The script was one of the best I have ever seen on screen, leaving you repeating the dialogue in your head from the previous conversation. DiCaprio knocked it out of the park with one of his best acting performances, not to mention everyone else in this movie did really good. The story is unpredictable and once the Scorsese credits hit the sliver screen you will still be questioning what you just saw. In my opinion, its one of the best films ever made. A must see!"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "A great film.  DiCaprio/Scorsese deliver again. Suspenseful and never dull. The ending is powerful. The score is an all time favorite of mine.

I havn't met one person out 40 different people who said it was even slightly bad.. so I don't understand what all these stupid critics and people giving it a 0 rating are for.

I enjoyed it a lot, but I think it's very overrated. It had some very good, thrilling moments, but overall it was predictable. I had the ending figured out after the first 90 minutes.

I absolutely did not see what was coming in the end.When the twist is revealed it all makes sense, the signs were there, yet the viewer's mind chooses to ignore it, just like the protagonist's mind, that's why it's a genius twist. Perfect ending!\rThe music is also great, it creates the tone for the movie.\rSome people say that you should watch this movie more than once, I would disagree with that statement. If you pay attention, you'll remember all the details in the end and it will combine in your head. Watching it for a second time however, I didn't find it thrilling anymore, because I knew everything and it just wasn't interesting.\rI note that I would not recommend this film to those with weak nerves. Some people I talked to told me they found it very violent, distressing and depressing.

It's hard to make a mystery/thriller movie that is so engaging, and remains engaging even after you watch the movie once and know the twist. The musical score to this film is absolutely haunting. Shutter Island is gruesome. It's dark. It's scary. It's powerful, and it has something to say. One of Scorsese and DiCaprio's best. This is a must-see film."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Shutter Island starts as an eerie investigation movie of a criminal insane facility. The beginning of the movie is interesting enough, but it becomes very riveting once the ultimate revelations of the plot are unraveled. It will completely shock you and startle you.

Anyone that likes psychological thrillers or films with complicated plots will love this movie."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "A complex plot presented in dark, brooding style. It holds your attention, draws you in and then leaves you thinking about it. It's like plain chocoalte and chili: richly textured and surprisingly good. I will return to Shutter Island before too long."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "In this film, two American police officers try to solve a crime that occurred in a prison insane asylum, isolated on an island full of mysteries. Directed by Scorcese, it is carried out by an excellent Leonardo DiCaprio, always impeccable in his character, deep and complex. Ben Kingsley also did a great job as the prison director. Mark Ruffalo was fine, but his character is almost erased by the brilliance of his colleagues. Max von Sydow makes a short appearance, but in an intense and striking character.The script is at least intelligent and provocative. He cleverly uses period elements, makes an unexpected but well-exploited connection to the drama of the Nazi death camps, the traumas of war, and the suffering that was felt in the early psychiatric hospitals. In fact, it is not by chance that most of them still have the reputation of being haunted, whether they are ruined or still in use. The psychiatric therapies used in this period, though they seemed absolutely barbarous to us, were the best at that time and contributed greatly to the better understanding of this field of medicine. Despite this, the movie is full of mysteries, unanswered questions or answers hidden in small details. Therefore, watch closely. If you blink, you may miss something decisive to understand the movie. The ending seemed disconcerting, but it made perfect sense. Cinematography makes an excellent introduction into the movie environment, which is pure mystery and suspense. It is dark, gray, misty, directing us to all the dark secrets that the island supposedly seems to hide. The soundtrack cleverly helps, as well as the shooting scenarios and locations, meticulously thought out to fit in history and historical time.A ambiguous movie full of mysteries, that never answers all our questions but requires a lot of attention and perhaps more than a visualization to understand. It certainly will not please all people but fans of DiCaprio, Scorcese and thriller movies will be very pleased with the result."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Pacing, content, acting, cinematography. This film has it all. There are very few flaws, if any, in this film. Ideal films should act like a dream, where the viewer is pulled from the world in which they exist and completely trans fixed with the fictional world in which they find themselves. Shutter Island does just that. Someone who is actively watching this movie will find themselves engrossed in the story and invested in the advancement of the plot. As far as the genre of psychological thrillers goes, this is just about as good as it gets.

In fact, few would be able to guess at the convoluted ending the movie adopts, which makes it all the more enthralling to be taken along for the ride.

Now, I only sometimes give spoilers, but I will not, would not, could not, should not, give away any important feature to this movie.
