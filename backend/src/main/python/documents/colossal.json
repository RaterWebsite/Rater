For those of you who haven\u2019t seen the trailer Ann Hathaway is the slightly annoying, out of work, \u201clet\u2019s party into the early hours of the morning\u201d kind of girl. After hitting a rough patch with her boyfriend she is forced to move back to her hometown. Meanwhile a giant monster randomly appears and starts destroying Seoul and eventually she starts to realise that she is somehow connected to this monster.It\u2019s as bizarre as it sounds but in the current cinema world of remakes, sequels and prequels nothing is more refreshing than some originality. So hats off to everyone involved in creating this unique monster movie with a twist. No it\u2019s not perfect but it did manage to win me over.

I'm surprised I didn't read more about what seems to me the obvious symbolism and allergory all through the movie. From the obvious Souel being a metaphor for her soul and the destruction she is causing to all those around her with her alcoholism or lifestyle to the empty house of her childhood. Everywhere I look there is symbolism, metaphors, and allergory that is fun to tease out. It can be almost too obvious such as when Gloria takes a long trip to get too her real Soeul and do what is morally right once she has stopped drinking. Or Sedakis bring out the biggest firecracker ever to blow up everything around him while drinking heavily and confronting his rival. It kept me constantly thinking as I knew everything has deeper meaning but is not fully explained. Love it"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Anybody who sees the trailer and expects a monster movie is set to be disappointed, which seems to be a constant theme among those disappointed: they expected something different. Whether they expected more of a monster movie or a comedic take on one, Colossal winds up missing the mark on both, simply because it is not necessarily either. Using elements of monster movies and comedy to tell its tale, Colossal is a genre bending film with a character study core as it examines the life of its lead character, her problems, and how she became who she is today. To do this, it does use a monster terrifying Seoul, but it is merely a device through which we learn about our protagonist and the people in her life. Smartly written with top-notch acting all around, Colossal is a surprisingly satisfying film that will make you laugh, but also  terrify, thrill, and entertain you with everything in its arsenal. It is, essentially, the swiss army knife of films. This, naturally, has its limitations, but writer/director Nacho Vigalondo deftly blending everything together into a cohesive and highly rewarding film is a practically miraculous achievement.Colossal tells the story of Gloria (Anne Hathaway). An out-of-work alcoholic, Gloria abuses the trust of boyfriend Tim (Dan Stevens) and makes a mockery of his hospitality in light of her financial status. Tim opts to show her some tough love by kicking her out and breaking up with her. Returning to her small hometown, Gloria pitches her tent in her parents' empty house, which is being rented out at the moment. While there, she runs into old elementary school friend Oscar (Jason Sudeikis) and, while paling around with him and his friends, scores a job as a bartender at the bar owned by Oscar. The only hitch in this newfound success? At 8:05 in South Korea, if Gloria walks through a playground near her home, she will appear as a huge monster and terrorize the people of Seoul. As we quickly learn, Oscar has the same affliction, appearing as a large robot. Becoming a global phenomenon, the film finds great comedy and excitement in the hysteria by showing the internet's reaction to the insanity, as well as the sheer bloody carnage created by Gloria and Oscar without any intent on their part.Yet, these kaijus are merely a gateway into the psyches of Colossal's protagonists. Peering into why both Gloria and Oscar are undeniably broken people, the film borders on becoming a thriller at moments, as well as being a fully-fledged character study. Tracing their current predicament with an event 25 years prior, which was also the first time the monster was seen in Seoul, Colossal shows just how deeply unhappy and self-loathing its characters are. A woman who got fired from her job as a writer and apparently faced some harassment online over it, Gloria feels inadequate and depressed. Fighting to be heard and stand tall as an individual, Gloria feels personally attacked whenever things go wrong or a situation turns sour, in part because she lacks the confidence in herself to really follow through on anything. As a result, she drowns her sorrows in a bottle in order to forget her past and allow her to not be consumed with the crushing weight of being a failure after having so many expectations placed upon her after getting out of her small town.On the other side, Oscar is a much darker character. Deeply disturbed, obsessed with Gloria, and caught in a vicious cycle of self-loathing that sees him exact his self-hatred on the world in order to vent, Oscar is a surprisingly dark and terrifying man. Gloria is taken aback by this, but Colossal quickly establishes just how much he envies her for having achieved so much by simply leaving the town. Pointing to the death of his mother - of whom he has a photo with her face scratched out - as the event that made Oscar turn, Colossal shows how Oscar seems to play Gloria for all of the inadequacy her feels and the sense that he is a complete failure. Lashing out at her and his friends, Oscar runs everybody off purely because of the violent and passionate hate he feels for himself.As a result of this characterization, we see how destructive their personalities and situations are. Though Gloria and Oscar suffer from their own issues, the people most impacted by their problems are those around them. They are greatly destructive people, both literally and figuratively squashing every opportunity, friendship, and relationship, set before them purely because they cannot get out of their own way and are consumed with their self-loathing. If they simply looked down and watched what they were stepping on, they may be able to catch themselves and stop before causing too much damage. However, like a kaiju, they simply stomp about and ruin every life they encounter along the way. A smart usage of kaijus to personify the inner demons of a person and the damage it can cause for those they love and hold dear, Colossal handles the issue in the proper way"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "A party girl unwilling to grow up (Anne Hathaway) is forced to leave her city life and move back to her little home town. She hears shocking news of giant creature threatening the capital of South Korea and comes to a realization that she is somehow connected to this phenomenon.Also starring: Jason Sudeikis, Dan Stevens, Austin Stowell, Tim Blake Nelson.This is one of those few \u2019weird\u2019 cool movies that deserve to go big. Having premiered in Toronto film festival last September and ready to attack multiplexes now, \u201eColossal\u201c offers fresh approach to monster and superhero movies, or maybe we should call it pastiche or something.It\u2019s a surehanded work by a guy who clearly knows and loves those genres, and feels confident about adding some stuff of his own.Solely written and directed by Nacho Vigalondo, the Spanish filmmaker perhaps best known for time-travelling mindbender \u201eLos cronocr\u00edmenes\u201c (2007), it\u2019s an experience so unexpected that I am not even sure how much if liked it.Sure, I liked most of it while watching, and liked some of it even more after going over everything intellectually later. But sitting in cinema, I felt unsatisfied at times without being able to clearly say why.Perhaps I just don\u2019t buy how the story reaches its turning point and transforms one major character \u2013 although it makes much more sense in the end.Perhaps \u201eColossal\u201c offers too many genres for its own good (monster movie, horror, drama, comedy, thriller, revenge, romance\u2026) and the potential impact of the whole result is weakened by this. Or perhaps it was just all too original for me and I would learn to appreciate it much more on the second go?But there\u2019s one thing that I am sure of: \u201eColossal\u201c is bigger than sum of its parts and feels fresh even if it reminds bunch of other movies.Most of all, Shyamalan came to mind although Vigalondo is a better writer with a better sense fo making story compact and still giving the events and characters enough room to develop and breathe.If you only watch one \u2019weird\u2019 cool mainstream-friendly movie this year, you should still pick \u201eGet Out\u201c, but \u201eColossal\u201c is noteworthy too.It can thrill and surprise you, and the acting\u2019s pretty good also. Hathaway as the leading lady actually seems a bit hammy at times, which is probably expected of her character.The showstealer here is, surprisingly, Jason Sudeikis who feels like a supporting player for big part of the movie and then turns into something of a revelation.I have never been ready to appreciate Sudeikis as a worthwhile addition to all the mainstream movie actors today. He is known for a bunch of forgettable comedies such as \u201eHorrible Bosses\u201c. At the same time, he has always felt strong enough performer and comedian in technical sense, good with lines, timing, and teamplay.\u201eColossal\u201c gives him an unexpected chance to shine, and he doesn\u2019t waste a single second of spotlight. I can\u2019t speak much about why he\u2019s so great here without giving spoilers about the story. But this kind of strong presence is surely surprising and has instantly made Sudeikis hundred times more interesting as an actor than ever before.Here\u2019s hoping that Vigalondo has Tarantino-like powers to make actors cool. Based on \u201eColossal\u201c, I\u2019d like to see Sudeikis turn into a star."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Voici une colossale d\u00e9bilit\u00e9 qui suffirait \u00e0 peine \u00e0 faire durer un \u00e9pisode de \"Big bang theory\" et \u00e0 laquelle il manque ici les rires enregistr\u00e9s.

As fascinating as the premise is, it's not given adequate time for development so viewers probably called BS on it which explains the poor box office.

I love such films, because I'm bored of the same old action, romance, horror, thrillers. But it had loads of flaws. It was hard to get rid of them.

So put aside your adult brain and enjoy it like a kid.I had not seen the teaser, trailer and never heard the storyline before trying it. I just went and sat, the initial parts were not that impressive. Because returning the hometown is a common clich\u00e9.

Unfortunately, since I go to the movies so much, this is a rare luxury, as I am normally inundated with trailers. I managed not to see one for Colossal. I did accidentally catch Anne Hathaway on the Tonight Show calling this \"a movie about a girl who gets drunk and then a monster terrorizes South Korea\" but I think I just blacked this out since it is such a ridiculous thing to say. But that is pretty much the premise.Anne Hathaway plays Gloria, an alcoholic who moves home during a tough time and falls into friendship with a group of guys who work/hang out at a bar. During this time at home, she realizes that when she walks through a playground in the early morning, a large monster materializes in a linked location in Seoul, South Korea.Instead of spoilers, I am just going to use this time to say that I love that Jason Sudeikis took this role, and he was awesome in this. If he was only in weird indie comedies for the rest of his life, I would see them all. He is so funny and sincere and strangely menacing.
