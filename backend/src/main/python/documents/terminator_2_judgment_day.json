The soundtrack, my god the soundtrack, the instrumentals are completely memorable, and i bet the intense intro song will be pounding in your head days after you've finished watching it.  It's one of the most memorable and highly underrated, from the looks of the critic scores on here, action movies of all time."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "The first Terminator was a very good film but this sequel took the franchise to a level it hadn't reached before or since.\r With Sarah Connor from the original movie now institutionalised her son, and future leader of the resistance against the machines, John Connor is living with Foster parents. The machines that rule the future send back a cyborg, played by the terrifying Robert Patrick, whilst the humans send back their own cyborg to protect him. Schwarzenegger again excels in a role he was born to play, his voice and physique suiting his cyborg character perfectly.\r This all leads to a series of truly memorable action sequences that still largely stand up today in terms of special effects. Add to this a surprisingly good script for what is largely an action fare and you have the ultimate action blockbuster."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "First off, I would give this a 9.5 out of 10. This is a great sic-fi. The best terminator movie. Acting is good. Everyone does a good job. Score is good, and has a really good story. Really well made. The visual effects and action sequences are great. Well made and are just amazing. Overall, this is a great 90s action blockbuster. You really should see it."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Yeah well, I am usually very critic about science-fiction movies, but this time the whole thing comes with a lot of action (exceptionally well done), and some light humor, which is not interfering with the mood of the movie. The time traveling aspects (yeah I know I am picky) are somewhat \"flawed\", but nothing I could not overlook (like in the case of Looper). One of Arnie's best, and the villain is also remarkable. Will remain a classic. The special effect were all very advanced back in the day. Some looks cheesy nowadays, but not bad. Recommended."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Maybe the critics don't like this one, but for viewers it is first class entertainment.Great action and special effects keep you on the edge of your seat for the entire movie.

If they sent Bach's music into space, they should have sent this film along with it. The Director's cut is a bit less concise but the original cinema release is devoid of any slip-ups. Each scene is there for a reason and shows us something new. The strength and weaknesses of the characters are clearly seen, but they are not brought to attention in a ham-handed way. The use of CGI is avoided for much of the film which is a godsend especially in the context of modern films. There are too many reasons to list as to why this film should be forever lauded... Aside from being the pinnacle of action films it teaches us some real lessons about the cost of human life."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "If you thought the first Terminator Movie was good then this is double the action and double the story. Great character development, More action, more explosion's and more heart. It is just one huge spectacle."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Terminator 2 is an amazing and enjoying thrill ride that is one of the best action movies ever. The plot is very well constructed, the acting (especially Arnold Schwarzennegger's Terminator) is top-notch and very memorable. The amount of depth each character has is just amazing and you identify with each character, there is such an emotional charge to each moment that you are sucked into the movie. The action scenes are top-notch and will keep you enthralled in it, there are many in the movie and suspense is well-maintained when needed as well. The movie is sure to be remembered and quoted every time for a long time (\"Hasta La Vista, Baby\"). Flaws, there are hardly any except for maybe it can be a bit lengthy and the action takes some time to get interesting but once it does it's awesome and it is a small flaw though. Overall, Terminater 2 is a smash-hit movie that is an example of a super-action flick deftly crafted with emotion that will be remembered forever and is almost as good as the first one.

If the first movie was good with Arnold being the evil Terminator hunting down the seemingly innocent Sarah Connor (while utilizing some very top notch special effects by 1984 standards,) this 1991 sequel is even better with Arnold being the good Terminator trying to prevent John Connor from being hunted down. This movie is well-placed, and focuses mainly on the three main characters, John, Sarah, and the now good Terminator as it should. This movie also gets high marks from me as it featured special effects that were WAY ahead of its time, courtesy of the new, evil Terminator that can regenerate its body, even when it's broken into dozens of pieces! This movie demonstrates that while we don't know for certain what is going to happen in the future, we are always in control of what happens in the present, and therefore, we all play a hand in shaping what the future will eventually have in store for us. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and I highly recommend it to people looking for some great thrills!"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Terminator 2 is a perfect movie.

What we have here is a masterfully made movie that tell the story of a future war fought in the past with not one but two terminators.

The acting is top knotch, the suspense relentless, and the special effects are mind blowing.  A rare film that lives up to, and even outdoes, the original."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This is a perfect example of an amazing sequel. It's truly better than the original in everyway. It was more intense, more action-packed and definitely had more quotable lines than the first one. As far as the story goes, it's an interesting and engaging story. It's a pulse pounding sci-fi story. That's what helps make for an awesome sci-fi thriller. As far as characters go some have there moments, but none of them were as bad-a** as the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and T-1000 (Robert Patrick). Watching those two fight was movie magic. But what really makes this movie awesome is it's super cool action and visual effects. Most action movies now of days tend to have great action, but a weak story. This movie held on to both contexts and gave it all it got in this riveting sequel. Overall, It's a rare, tremendous blockbuster done right."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "He\u2019s back! This second Terminator film truly is greater in every way.\r In comparison with the first Terminator film is this second installment much better when it comes to action sequences, practical effects and storytelling. The major improvement is of course the villain: the T-1000. He\u2019s so scary and awesome at the same time. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong are all spectacular actors, and their characters are so incredible and you really feel close to them. The actors are much more professional now than in the first film. There\u2019s a massive amount of action in this movie, and there\u2019s a huge amount of cool and unique things at the same time. The action is much faster and there are spectacular practical effects that just look incredible. The first Terminator film got some doll models, but this does not. Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a highly entertaining and well-made film that got a touching story and even some humor! The opening scene and the ending are both great, even though the ending felt a bit to rash. The soundtrack is also great, but it could have been even groovier, which could have made the film even cooler and dramatic.\r This movie got it all: great science fiction, awesome action sequences and fantastic storytelling. Not to mention the incredible script.\r Terminator 2: Judgment Day gets an 8.8/10."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This movie takes everything that i loved about the original terminator but fixes the complaints i had.
