Wouldn't this line turn them off to the movie, or at least force these critics to put themselves in a horror aficionado's shoes while watching the flick?\r \"she arrives to find herself ... forced to play a sadistic game of Would You Rather, where only the winner will get out alive.\"\r The movie has a great premise AND original story with fine acting to boot (rare in a B-movie). Budget limits are effectively managed so that you barely notice the low budget impact. In fact, because some of the more horrific scenes are not shown they are more cringe-worthy as your mind gets to fill in the details.\r But the standout is Jeffrey Combs of Reanimator/From Beyond fame that plays the host of the WORST DINNER PARTY GAME EVER! He balances his sociopathic morality with a genteel propriety that makes his character stand out of the very-disposable extras.\r The twist ending is predictable and you wish the more dastardly character deaths were more horrific, but overall it is a very entertaining horror flick. The excellent Roger Ebert, God rest his soul, would hate this movie, but I would never use his reviews for horror movies."

      "text": "Released in 2013, this is by far one of my favorite hidden gems on Netflix. I happened upon this movie one night while at my sister\u2019s house, and it has became a Netflix favorite for me since. It is my go to movie when my friends and I can\u2019t think of a fun horror film to watch. It\u2019s not going to be the best horror film you\u2019ve ever seen, but if you like anything similar to Saw, Hostel, or really anything with a torture porn feel, you\u2019ll at least respect this.Starting out we meet protagonist Iris, portrayed by Brittany Snow. She\u2019s down on her luck, trying to find a job anywhere to help take care of her little brother. We learn early on that her parents died in a car accident, and her brother is very sick in need of a bone marrow transplant. In a meeting with his doctor, Lawrence Gillard Jr., about the options they have, we are also introduced to Shepard Lambrick, Jeffrey Combs. Lambrick tells Iris that he has the means to help her and her brother, and all she has to do is attend a dinner party at his house the following evening. If she does this, he can pay off all of her medical debt, and find a suitable bone marrow match for her brother, and even skip all waiting lists. Skeptical, Iris asks Dr. Barden if this is legit, because I agree, it is kind of shady that a man you\u2019ve never met is willing to do all of this in exchange for a dinner party. Iris decides to take the evening to think it over.Later in the evening, Iris receives a call informing her that she didn\u2019t get the job she was interviewing for in the opening sequence. Desperate, she calls and accepts the invitation to Shepard\u2019s dinner party. Arriving at the house, we meet the rest of the cast and learn that there will be a \u2018game\u2019 to determine who wins the money. Everything starts out fine, a semi-formal dinner party with good food and service, and most of the other \u2018contestants\u2019 seem nice enough.Trouble arises when Iris informs Lambrick that she is a vegetarian and doesn\u2019t eat meat. He offers her ten thousand dollars to eat the steak and liver on her plate, which she reluctantly accepts. Let the games begin. From here on out, things get messy\u2013literally. He challenges the group\u2019s morals and integrity in a twisted game of would you rather. Some of the challenges include slicing open an eye, shocking each other, and basically drowning people. There\u2019s so much more, and I love it. I think it is such a good example of what desperate people will do to get the help that they need.Jeffrey Combs gives an amazing performance of the sadistic ring leader of the game. He is unapologetically cruel and comfortable with what he is doing. He is funny and carefree. He loves seeing the group squirm, and he isn\u2019t afraid to invoke violence on those who need it. Brittany Snow gives a warming performance of Iris, the naive girl who will do anything to help her brother. The rest of the cast is memorable, some more than others\u2013I\u2019m looking at you Enver Gjokaj. Some of the acting among other cast members isn\u2019t great, but overall I think Combs and Snow do a good enough job on their own.You will care about the characters, you will want to cover your eyes, and you\u2019ll gasp at the ending. You won\u2019t be able to help but love Shepard Lambrick and his twisted mind. This won\u2019t be a movie that wins any awards, and most people might not enjoy it as much as I do, but as far as Netflix films go, I think it\u2019s worth the watch. Every so often you stumble across a good one, and this is it for me."

The script is a little weak, each character's decisions are predictable in every way possible, and the concept had so much more potential than what the film ended up being. But I watched this film with a group of friends and ended up enjoying it quite a bit. This is definitely one of those films that would be a bit of a disappointment if you watch it alone, but becomes far better if you watch it with a group of people."

The acting is, for the most part, sub-par; Snow, in particular, comes off very amateurish at times. From start to finish, the movie pushes the viewer away. The entire film is tense, cold, and hopeless, so, when the thrills come, and there are plenty (one of the few areas in which the movie did its job), they feel like little prods to the stomach while one is already experiencing bad indigestion. All the plot twists, and here I use the term lightly, are completely predictable. Movies like this are powerful because they let the viewer get close, even comfortable, and then pull the proverbial rug; \"Would You Rather\" lets all its nastiness hang out from the very moment the game begins. Movies like this also derive power from the close and complex relationships between their characters and their viewers; in \"Would You Rather,\" every time a character dies, it just feels like some awful statistic. This film is very unapproachable; even film franchises like Saw and Hostel are more approachable than this film. \"Would You Rather\" left a bad taste in my mouth, and, yes, I would rather have not watched it."

There are elements of 2012 horror 'Truth or Dare (Die)' here, expect Would you Rather is miles ahead on inventiveness, character and overall story. All i can say is that this is one hidden gem that should not be missed"

      "text": "A really good independent Horror film is worth it's weight in gold. Finding that diamond in the rough makes the hours of sitting through low budget garbage, well worth it. For me, Would You Rather is that diamond, as it is one of the most imaginative Horror films to come along in years. Shepard Lambrick (Jeffrey Combs) is an eccentric millionaire, who wants to help people that are down on their luck, except there's a catch. With a large sum of money at stake, Lambrick invites several down on their luck people to his mansion, where they must play a game in order to win, a deviously twisted game. Would you rather stab yourself or a complete stranger? Would you rather take a razor blade to your eyeball or cut off your own finger? These are some of the challenges involved in this game, which sees the winner go home rich and the losers in worse shape then when they started. Jeffrey Combs of Star Trek fame stars and was absolutely the perfect choice to play the sadistic millionaire. In all his roles he has this crazy twisted side, behind the mask of a very likeable guy. In this film he is paired with the beautiful Brittany Snow, who is there to help her sick brother. As it turns out, she is the logical one, who tries to match wits with Lambrick, making for some terrific dialogue. Would You Rather is creepy and graphic, just when you think you have it all figured out, the story takes a twist, and you're back into the satanic paradise. This film is everything I look for in Horror and will definitely be included in my 2015 Halloween Horrorfest, and it should absolutely be considered for yours."

Similar films? Clue, Cube, Saw 2-7 etc. I found this film very enjoyable and the main 'villain' or well antagonize was hilarious. I'd say its worth a watch. It's not even full of a bunch of blood and gore either. Honestly, I think this movie deserves more love. I gave it a 9.\r Thanks for reading my review. Check it out if you're a fan of...\r 1. Horror films.\r2. So called 'torture porn' eh, I'm not a fan of that term because its honestly seen as negative but this film is more than just people getting tortured. Hope that didn't turn you off from the film.\r3. Characters in a room films. Seriously, I don't know what to call these types of films. Remember the Twilight Zone episode Five Characters In Search of an Exit? I like stuff like that. A bunch of characters stuck in a room and they have to figure out how to get out of the room. Well in this movie they have to play a game. You like the SAW films? Hey you might like this. Or maybe you won't but I still say its worth checking out."

Would You Rather is about a group of people who are invited to a dinner party with the promise that one of them will win a sum of money if he or she wins a game. Obviously because this is a movie, this game of would you rather isn't going to be your average parlor game. What the contestants have to choose between is life-threatening, and only one person is going to get out alive. Since there's virtually no plot to the movie, it does feel like you're watching one !!+!+% up YouTube challenge at times, but what saves this movie from being completely unbearable is the twists that the host puts on the game. It does make the film rather unpredictable and incredibly intense. Many scenes had me cringing because of the grisly nature of some of the dilemmas. There are a few glaring issues with the entire premise; it is mentioned that this game is played yearly, so why didn't one of the winners call the cops after finishing the game? I mean you were held hostage for a night while you were practically tortured, and seven people ended up dead. I wouldn't call this a particularly enjoyable film, but if you just want a crazy and intense little movie, Would You Rather is a decent choice."

I think Brittany Snow could've done better acting and the guy who played Lucas in the movie did a really good job on acting. His part towards the end where he was forced to slit his eye gave me goosebumps all over. It was so nerve wracking just watching him. And when he actually slit his eye I just had to look away. The whole game throughout this movie was ****   up and I couldn't stand the fact that you legit had to do the choices when they were both harsh and terrifying. If it was me, and I had to choose, I would've just said no and would have rather had the servant guy shoot me than to continue playing that gruesome game. I was also surprised that Snow survived being held underwater for two minutes. I thought she was sure to die, but at the same time the main character really never dies. I wished that Lucas was the one to survive, it would've been a good twist. I didn't like the fact that Snow went through that whole death defying game for her brother just to go home and find out he's dead. He was dead right? I mean, it looked like he was, but he could've just passed out or something. Nevermind, he probably did die, it's just that Snow was screaming \"What did you do?\" and it got me thinking that he might've taken drugs or something and overdosed. But overall, I like the movie and had a good time watching it, no, to better phrase it, I had an exciting time that left me holding my pillow to cover my face. There ya go."

It's a suspense filled film that dives into the psyche of mankind and shows just what kind of messed up things people can and will do just for the simple chance to earn whatever it is that they desire. Jeffrey Combs as Shepard Lambrick is delightfully twisted as you sit on the edge of your seat, just wondering what sort of torture this man is going to put these desperate individuals through.

I was not hoping for Scream, just something for me to look back on and say \"Hey, I don't regret watching this.\" I regret watching this film. The premise is interesting, that's my praise. The bad stuff starts now. The acting: below average, it isn't atrocious, but it isn't good. The plot: boring and predictable, the twist at the end is so bad (I really can't think of any other words to describe it) that I wanted to throw a brick at the television. The sub-plot of Iris' friend who won the previous torture house goes to save her is so dumbfounding in its plot holes such as \"why doesn't he call the police?\" and \"why did he let her enter the challenge in the first place?\" Not to mention that he has no character so his death, which is treated as an emotional moment, is, well, not emotional. However, the worst offense of this film is the characters, the awful, boring characters. The largest problem I have with this film is how one-dimensional every character is. What gets under my skin is: if you take away one defining characteristic from every character, then who are they? Let me give you a few examples: who is Iris if you take away her brother who has cancer? Who is the alcoholic if you take away the part where he is an alcoholic? Who is the disabled old lady if you take away her disability? The answer is no one. now in a film fueled about us caring about characters an what they do, you need likable characters who we care about, not ones as one dimensional as there characters being summed up in one sentence.This is a long review but only because there is so much garbage in this film. If you like this film then that's fine, but it has a lot of blatant flaws. Just my overlong two cents (or pence where I live.)"

I think the actors do a good job at portraying the fear and anxiety of being stuck in a death game. But I felt as if the characters had some room to be fleshed out with their backstories and motivations.Next, the at sometime confusing directing. For Example, the set up for Dr. Barden going to crash the death game is completely pointless. They take multiple scenes to set it up but there's little to no payoff as he's offed practically as soon as he arrives at the manor. Earlier in the movie there is a scene where Iris, the main character helps another one of the characters, Linda into a building. This literally sets up nothing besides a wave between Iris and Linda I guess. Which also does nothing. Those are just some specific examples of pointless scenes, but there's plenty of them across the film. Then the barrel round seems very contrived. If I were them I would take the barrel any day. The average person can breath underwater for 60-90 seconds. I believe it's a much better option than a random punishments. But at some points I did like the at times slower paced parts which  really makes me feel for the characters.Lastly, the ending. To me the ending is extremely unsatisfying to me. It almost makes the main plot as pointless as the Dr. Barden sub-plot. It feels like it's sad just to be sad and it doesn't feel satisfying to the viewer.  There's little to no previous foreshadowing and comes completely out of left field. I feel as if it isn't a good twist and it could of been handled better. If It would've been handled better I would of at least felt more satisfied at the ending. But I think a more bitter-sweet ending where Iris' brother survives would've done the best. An ending where they play into the aftermath where she saves her brother, but she has to deal with the trauma and survivor's guilt of being the winner of death game. Her brothers alive, but at what cost?"
