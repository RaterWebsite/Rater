      "text": "The one is definitely one of the best movies that Jet Li has ever acted in.For starters I would like to say that this movie has nothing to do with the Matrix in fact The One is whole lot more better than any movie in the matrix series.My most favorite parts of the movie are the introduction and the ending because they had the most wicked fight scenes that I have ever seen in my life.I loved seeing the Cops getting their A$#ES kicked around in the beginning and then seeing prisoners get their tails kicked in the end.I am EXTREMELY glad that the creators didn't get the rock to star in this movie because The Rock's street fighting style isn't anywhere as cool as Jet Li's martial arts and he can't act as good as Jet either. I also annoyed the music that played for each fight scene because it really helped to bring the movie to life.The sound effects were also very nice, especially the lightning sounds that you hear in the final chapter in the movie when yu law got sent to the stygian penal colony.The last but not least thing about this movie was the purple lighting and other things that the creators used used in the introduction to separate the differences between the parallel universes.The concept of parallel universes has made a very interesting story and script. By the way the review that Taylor B. wrote me laugh a little.I'm just happy to see that there are other people that enjoyed the movie as much as i did, because most critics are A#$ES who wouldn't know a good movie or video game when they see one. I still watch this movie a couple times a week from time to time."

Dude this movie rocked, It had action it had story and it had music, the martial arts was good, but I guess typical humans what they don't know they hate, he used like 3 forms of martial arts and the scenes were good, the graphics were good, and WHERE IN THE MATRIX DID YOU SEE BODIES GO SLOW MOTION, it was awesome they way the moved super slow and he Jet Li d their ass."

      "text": "As bad as critics say? Absolutely not but it's still not that good. CGI looked too fake, Action is alright but not all that good either, Acting is weak as well. It is interesting though, I give it that. I am quick to stop watching a movie if it sucks so The One can't be able that bad if I managed to sit through it."

      "text": "I like the ideas and it is a solid and entertaining movie. My main critique is that they do not enough with the ideas. Basically there is not much development and resolve if you look at it after the conclusion. Luckily it has still good scenes, martial arts and actors that deliver a good performance. It uses the theory of parallel universes. This is the idea that our universe is just one of many that create a multiverse. For each possibility you can imagine there might be an entire universe. In \u201cThe One\u201d travel between universes is possible as in some universes Earth scientists have discovered the technology to do it. However not every Earth has it and in many the governments do not know about it. In one universe the \u201cMultiverse Authority\u201d exist which polices interdimensional travel. The problems for them started before the events of the movie when one of their agents Gabriel Yulaw killed another universes version of himself in self defense. This made him and all other alternate versions stronger. So he chose to kill all other versions of himself in the 124 universes to become what he calls \u201cThe One\u201d. He was pretty successful and the only remaining alternate is Gabe Law. This is the excellent set up of the story. The ideas is interesting and well done. Like I already said the conclusion could be better but to be fair I cant criticize the final scenes as those are awesome too. It just lacks a bit of resolve. The fights are well choreographed and those are truly enjoyable. These go hand in hand with the special effects and stunts as they use the set up of the story to do more. Character wise we have Jet Li as Gabriel Yulaw and Gabe Law. He delivers a good performance in both roles and I was surprised that he can be such a good bad guy. As a side note: Dwayne Johnson should actually play the main role. Maybe this will be used in one of his movies. Then we have Jason Statham as Agent Funsch. He also delivers a good performance. Sadly I would rather prefer a full team up or being antagonist wit Jet Lee. I specially praise Carla Gugino as T. K. Law for her performance. Other than those Delroy Lindo\u2019s performance is also good. I see no missteps here and say all did a good job. I want to praise the soundtrack too. It has tracks from Papa Roach, Disturbed and Drowning Pool which is awesome and hits my taste in music. I value this as additional strength. Overall this is an awesome movie but also a disappointment. I will no go into a rant as I was well entertained. It is one of the rare movies that I would describe as entertaining disappointments if that makes sense for you."
