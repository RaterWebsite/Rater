Low on bloody gore but high on atmosphere, most of which is wonderfully generated by simple shots such as roads, trees a gate or a swimming pool. These and many other ordinary compositions have been lit and captured in a way that gives the film its eerie sense of menace and dread. In the main the film owes its success to these simple details masterfully directed by David Robert Mitchell. Maika Monroe, looking very much like Chloe Sevigny, registers strongly as the young victim of events, and the nerve jangling score is another great contributor. It is also good to be able to report that the film does not rely on gimmicky shock tactics to raise the hairs on your neck. In fact, there are surprisingly few jumps to be had. Still, this doesn't prevent the film from holding you mesmerised in the palm of its hand for almost its entire running time or, at least, until an unsatisfactory ending somewhat disappoints."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This movie MUST get a wide distribution this spring. There are so many meager horror movies released nation-wide every year (picture a 20-something \"possessed\" female with arms bending back and milky eyes), and there are a few gems (The Guest, You're Next, A Terrible Way to Die) that cut through the morass.  This is one of those gems. It's a beautifully shot, spare horror thriller with an amazing retro-analog synth score that keeps you tense and engaged throughout.  The basic premise and \"rules\" simple-yet-brilliant and lead to some highly fresh and fun terror sequences. Maika Monroe, fresh off her solid role in The Guest, raises her game with a stellar performance. And every one of the supporting actors, the setting, and the \"It\" are all so authentically drawn, you leave the theater with a smile on your face.

It's a must for horror fans and anyone looking for a genuine thrill."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "A sense of uneasiness looms over the whole movie.  Throughout the whole movie, you can't place when it is taking place.  There is a lack of people outside of the main characters for the majority of scenes.

This film has a very simple concept when it comes to the monster, however it really does a great job in building the tension. This film takes a lot of elements from A Nightmare on Elm Street. For example, you'll see a female lead struggling to sleep through fear, you'll see skin bruises caused by an invisible monster, you'll see a group of teenagers dealing with the monster, while none of the parents appear to be involved, also they take a scene straight out of the movie when the female lead tries to call her friend (who happens to look a little like Johnny Depp) across the street through her bedroom window at nighttime to warn him about the monster before he dies in his bedroom...

The movie just drags on for what seems like forever after an admittedly intriguing opening, only to devolve into shots that go on for way, WAY too long that focus on nothing of real significance, little is explained as to what \"it\" is, why \"it\" follows, why \"it\" is at times unable to open a door, which \"it\" then resorts to breaking windows, then is able to hurl large electronics into a swimming pool and take on a completely different level of physicality that makes you question what the hell it's actually capable of. That's how a lot of the movie is: something is vaguely eluded to and you think you know the 'rules', because as an audience, we're being told a story and we want to feel like we have a personal stake in the film, feel a little immersion, etcetera. But little to nothing is ever explained. Characters are just not interesting. Jay's sister seems to be there to be a shoulder to cry on in close ups when things \"get crazy\" and doesn't really have an arc to her story at all. There's another girl with glasses and a \"shell phone\" in the group that provides almost nothing other than famous quotes delivered in a monotonous, pretentious tone of voice during low points, just to keep it's floundering head above water in hopes that the audience will put up with just a little more punishment.\r There is some good here, though. The lead actress, Maika Monroe, is genuinely great. She's convincing when she needs to be and most importantly, does a fantastic job acting terrified, confused and worn down. The cinematography is beautiful, showcasing the various suburbs, beaches, vacant buildings, worn down houses and schools with some artistic flair, wide shots that are awesome to look at and the sound design is great as well.\r The score is alright, but songs are repeated to the point of ad nauseum and I think he's trying too hard to be John Carpenter. But to wrap this all up and to maybe paint a better picture of what I'm trying to say, let's talk about Halloween, a film I've seen some reviewers compare this to. You have the character of Michael Myers, who for the most part is a mute, slow-moving stalker of teens, much like the \"it\" of this film. The reason Michael works and this doesn't is because everything about him is laid out by Dr. Loomis. You have exposition to explain what he is, what makes him tick, he had a legitimate purpose and goal. Jason of the Friday the 13th movies is the same: we the audience know his motivation. Those movies aren't about the teens, they're about the monsters. But it's a monster we identify with. \"It Follows\" is like this: we like the 1980s, let's get some old televisions with classic monster movies on them, older cars for this never fully defined time period because what the hell, that's pretty cool. Get some teens having sex in here because that's what Craven and Carpenter and Romero would have done, right? But get this...what if I was so original as to come up with the idea that our \"Michael Myers\" is transmitted from kid to kid like an STD?! Except it isn't always the same guy and nobody can see him unless you have it. Oh, and nobody ever knows what it is and I'll never say because it's better for the audience to just come to their own conclusions about the scraps of information I've fed them, sparsely, over a 2 hour time span. I mean, Kubrick never had to explain \"The Shining\", right? I can be Kubrick.\r Guys..?"}, {"rating": "3", "text": "After seeing its sky-high metascore, I eagerly grabbed a ticket for this, and it was quite a letdown.\r Pros: Dialogue and acting were decent, and the aethetics were often very beautiful.\r Cons: Wasn't scared a single time.

It eliminates a lot of predictability often seen in other horror movies and builds its own story along with the viewer's attention. The setting of the movie is really enjoyable with somewhat relatable characters and a mysterious/terrifying force that keeps coming at you throughout the movie always keeping the main character and the viewer on edge.One thing that I personally liked is those modern movies nowadays always have to \"google\" or go to a \"library\" in order to find out what that \"thing\" is. This movie leaves that open to interpretation which was quite good and instead focuses on its intense moments and the stress the characters have to go through in order for them to succeed in getting rid of it.I also enjoyed some inducing horror aspects of the creature itself where you end up looking at the screen thinking of where or if that's the thing that is coming. A really chilling experience.+ Well acted+ No jump scares+ The atmosphere is well built as well as the setting+ The creature itself is interesting and new, well-executed+ No shakey cam+ Feels like a throwback to classic movies in all the right ways+ A chilly experience+ Better to view with someone else- It plays it safe sometimes- The ending could've been slightly better"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "An unusual allegory to the danger of pleasure, but also a dominant realization that shows us the conformism of modern life.

The basic concept of a \"thing\" walking towards you, that others cannot see, and will never stop until you're dead or you've \"passed it on\" is both simple and very unnerving. The acting is good for the most part. The lead (Maika Monroe) is great in the movie. The best part of this movie is the atmosphere it creates. The unnerving electronic music and the beautiful and eerie wide-shots create a great atmosphere, which causes you to constantly feel slightly on edge throughout the movie, nervously searching the screen for \"It\". The pacing is good overall, but the movie starts to drag a bit in the middle. The pool scene had a few plot holes (as well as some of the decisions the characters made), but was quite intense nonetheless. An issue I had with this movie is the rules of \"It\". It is described to only walk slowly towards the person who has \"it\". Yet at times, \"It\" can crush windows, open doors, swim, jump, stand still, and other stuff. This movie gets the good score it gets for the acting by the lead, the cinematography, music and score, and as well the story.
