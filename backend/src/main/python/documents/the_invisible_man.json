The jump scares aren't cheap and stupid, it's filmed very well, and Elizabeth Moss did great in this film. It was very suspenseful.

Final Verdict: 9/10"}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Whannell's directing experience with The Invisible Man provides a riveting horror plot that still leaves questions towards some of the decision-making that transpires throughout the movie. Overall, there are areas I really enjoy but also dislike. It is hard to grade this one, not going to lie. I just find myself viewing this movie as \"mediocre\" with potential to be something greater.First off, the plot was great. I really enjoyed the thriller/horror experience with such a foggy perspective of Cecilia's mind from the start. You know something is wrong with her mentally, but it keeps getting worse or clearer as the movie continues. I thought the ending was bland, but understood the mindset behind it. With the amount of intensity that the entire movie provided, I just believe it could have offered more for the ending scene (although, the death scene was insane... in a good way).Cast was fantastic, I really believed everyone did their job well with their respected roles. One issue I did have with the cast was Moss's character as Cecilia. There were some cases where I just believed it was hard to watch her act. The dinner scene with her sister was crazy, but I think her state was too altered to switch from normal to insane every 5 seconds. Do not find it realistic as well. There were times her acting also reminded me of Jordan Peele's \"Us\" movie once her cloned killed her. It was that kind of insanity I did not want to see, but it seemed to show up in some cases which was not what was intended for her character in my opinion.I was split on some of the special effects. Although I understand the complications that come from fighting something invisible, it sometimes just turned funny rather than scary watching them fight the invisible man. Overall, it was not bad, but not super good.One main problem I have with this movie is the amount of things that do not make sense. From the beginning there were many scenes that just provided no significance or common sense to the overall film and it definitely is the main reason why I gave this a 6.5/10. Cecilia cutting her wrist and surviving without bleeding out after a 15+ minute scene. The Invisible Man seemingly surviving almost every blunt force that comes at him expect the bullets at the end. The Invisible Man was essentially a superhero with that costume, almost killing everyone with a single hit. Also, what is the significance to the cameras on the costume? What is the significance of the money if he was going to take it away anyways? Why did they never check security footage at the dinner with her sister? Is the Invisible Man omnipresent (he gets places sooooooo fast)? There are many questions that ultimately leave me baffled with this movie. They could have provided more realism to it and it did not seem to offer that when I saw it.I would recommend seeing it. I believe it is a \"love it or ya hate it\" kind of film. Won't see it again though."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "A brilliant update.  Great atmosphere construction, I was tense most of the film.  The scenes that suggest a presence (even if we are not seeing it) are sensational."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Serviceable film, watchable film.  Bogged down with cliches and doesn\u2019t fully transcend its genre as it appeared eager to do at first.  I was entertained moment to moment but baffled by the film\u2019s logic.  It fails to pass the test of: why don\u2019t they just use cell phones and videos to solve these problems.  Which gives the script a \u201cwritten in the 90\u2019s vibe\u201d which is kind of how the movie feels (at its best) but it\u2019s extremely  modern in other ways, having major plot turns rely on email, uber and the suit\u2019s futuristic technology.  So where is the cell phone video?  We\u2019re talking about a story about a woman entirely out to prove that she\u2019s being stalked by an invisible intruder and she doesn\u2019t think to herself \u201cI can film this to prove it.\u201d  If you can look past that sort of stuff, it\u2019s a fine movie.

Most studios just throw out really bad horror movies in January and February just to get rid of them. The Invisible Man is the rare exception. While a had a lot of issues with the film, it still was a very solid effort and did the one thing a horror movie should do, be scary. The film\u2019s biggest trait is that it does not rely on cheap jumpscares. It instead relies on a natural build up of tension that pays off with an interesting and unique scare. The film also doesn\u2019t continuously use the same type of scare. Some horror movies will continuously use the scary face trope to get a reaction but The Invisible Man doesn\u2019t. Each scare is unique in its own way. I won\u2019t spoil any of them because they are quite creepy and need to be seen and not explained. Elisabeth Moss does a great job in this film. She is able to communicate this sense of loneliness while being surrounded by everyone and was able to convey the emotions of fear, sadness, and joy in a natural yet intentionally creepy way. The rest of the cast does a fine job but really don\u2019t compare to Moss. The only thing holding her performance from being top notch is the screenplay. Some of the lines of dialogue were very awkward and took away from some scenes because of how corny or lame they were. That didn\u2019t happen throughout the whole movie but when it did, it was noticeable. The rest of the film\u2019s technical aspects were pretty good. The direction from Leigh Whannell was unique and interesting and the cinematography was pretty great. Each shot was visually interesting and had something to offer. The way they shot some of the scenes was great. Exchanges were shot from many different points of view and the camera was able to spin around and follow characters exact movements during action sequences. One technical aspect I took issue with was the score. While the actual composition of the music was good, the repetitiveness of it was a little irritating. The film kept using the same song for more intense scenes and it got distracting after a while. It didn\u2019t delve into different ways to use music for scenes with high amounts of tension and I really wish it had done that. The film also has a lot of plot inconsistencies and dumb character decisions. One such inconsistency that isn\u2019t spoiler related is when a car crashes. The front of the car is really banged up but it\u2019s shown less than a minute later and it\u2019s completely fixed. Overall, The Invisible Man is a mostly smart horror movie with a great lead performance, story, direction, and cinematography but is almost undermined by a weak screenplay, plot inconsistencies, and dumb character decisions."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Points for originality, acting and overall mood but falters a lot due to a lot of stuff that makes no sense. Plot holes all over the place. The ending is dreadful. For some reason the super strong pyscho is suddenly able to have his hand grabbed by her and made to slit his own throat. Convenient for the plot, sure, but a total farce. And notice how she is far too confident by the end. She starts off very timid and nervous and at the end she's strolling carelessly out of his place, smiling to herself, having just murdered him. I'm not doubting she'd be relieved, but she handles it all with such ease it just feels wrong. It's all just tied up far too quickly and conveniently - the end. Boring.

Why didn't Cecilia told her sister and to her cop friend about Adrian's cellphone that she found on her **** attick weeks after Adrian was dead? The trailers tell another story, I thought it was going to be a thriller about a damaged person from all those years of abuse. Maybe she had schizophrenia, maybe it was all inside her head but NOPE, man bad wears an invisible cape suit. At this point, I lost all interest.

Son of a gun, they actually did it. Universal finally made a GOOD remake of one of their classic monster movies!! (Celebration by Kool and the Gang plays) Not only is it a good remake, I\u2019d say it\u2019s the best Universal Monster movie since Creature from the Black Lagoon! This remake is very different from the original 1933 film as well as the HG Wells novella it was loosely based on so purists may still be unhappy with this movie, but I\u2019m all for updates to the classics (that\u2019s pretty much what the original films were, they\u2019re almost nothing like the original books) so it didn\u2019t bother me at all. The Invisible Man updates the story in very clever ways that I won\u2019t spoil here and it gives a sci-fi horror twist to a relevant story about an abusive relationship. Nobody sees it happening and nobody believes the main character when she tells people about it. Huh. The lead performance from Elisabeth Moss (yes, I\u2019m spelling her name correctly this time) is fantastic, and this movie is SCARY! The original 1933 film was very effects-heavy with a lot of comedy. In this, there is no comedy to be found and the effects are very minimal, but even if the movie is showing you nothing it makes you feel the presence of an evil figure lurking around using only framing, sound design and Elisabeth Moss\u2019 performance. There are tons of tense and creative sequences (very similar to the director\u2019s last film, Upgrade) and a ton of suspense. You never know when the titular character is going to show up next and it keeps you on the edge of your seat! I think the movie was a little too fast-paced, the buildup to what\u2019s really going on could\u2019ve been slower and more effective, and the score can be loud and overbearing at times, but overall I thought this movie was excellent. This is a must-see for any horror fan or fan of the classics! I\u2019m so happy this movie is a hit and we\u2019ll be getting more movies like it! I can\u2019t wait, this is going to be awesome. The Universal Monsters are back and I couldn\u2019t be more happy.

He's been declared dead, but she finds herself menaced by this unseen force. This was a decent film.Though there is violence, this is one of those films that relies on more on suspense, and it's done really, really well. Rather than kill Cecilia, the invisible man is trying to ruin her life. He's subtle at first and there is a lot of tension wondering if he's in the room or not and what he's going to do next. And when stuff happens, it can be pretty startling at times.The movie looks great. Director Leigh Whannell (Upgrade, Insidious 3) continuous his style: a starkly lit look. There are a lot of nice wide shots and pans to give the impression that Cecilia is being watched. (However, I thought that the opening scene was a little too darkly lit.)Moss, whose character is the biggest part of the film, does an excellent job portraying a woman going through trauma but is also wily when threatened.This isn't a perfect movie, though. Running at two hours and four minutes this didn't have to be that long. There are too many scenes of Cecilia being freaked out or people not believing her. The antagonist's plan didn't have to be that complicated. (Though it does mostly make sense in the long run. I've seen other movies with this level of intricacy that couldn't pull it off.) Also, there are several lines of dialogue and decisions that don't feel natural.Overall, I don't think you need to see this immediately, but if you like suspense then this if for you."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Leigh Whannell crafts a visceral thriller with a new updated take on the classic story.WHANNELL has been in my opinion one of the most underrated director /writers for a long time. He was mostly behind the insidious and saw franchises And came out with the spectacular futuristic thriller upgrade in 2018. His brilliant style is once again back with full force in this new adaptation of the invisible man. many people will just look at this like another Blum house manufactured film at first but realize that just because it has the production name on it doesn't mean it will be another throwaway film. This film much like upgrade thrives with a crisp smart script and fantastic visuals. Whannell has a keen eye for detail and it shows in bunches in this film. Elizabeth Moss also gives a phenomenally dedicated performance And sheds emotion throughout. There are many moments in this vicious film that you will not see coming and I was actually surprised by the amount of brutality which serves the overall story well. This is a new take on a classic universal monster that you will not want to miss and it's definitely worthy of going to see in the theater unlike many films of late."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "To be completely honest, after watching this movie, I am shocked to see a 7.1 from both the audience and critics, that rarely lines up, and usually, both aren't so horrendously wrong. I went in with low expectations from Blumhouse, after their last few movies they have felt like a shadow of who they used to be and this movie reflects that, loudly. The Invisible Man is one of the worst movies I have seen this year and I am an avid moviegoer who goes typically 3-5 times a month. Not only does it have multiple moments where it appears to be ending (sort of like the false endings in LoTR), but it just continuously drags on with so very little going on at damn near every point of the f***ing movie. I'd say the beginning of the movie was the most interesting part, but they never build or show their relationship, we have no way of knowing just how terrible Adrian really was to her. It seemed odd that they refused to show the abusive relationship, I mean, the movie is over 2 hours long, and there's next to nothing about their relationship. I think the movie possibly could have benefitted from showing how **** of a person Adrian actually was in their relationship. Instead, we get he-said-she-said type of **** that never amounts to much.Compared to the original's charm, it has nothing going for it. The twist is lame and illogical (also predictable), and large parts of the movie just do not add up. For instance, during her daring escape from the mental institute, no one is seeing the people get murdered? They all assume it is her and when she passes by the guard station, you can clearly see cameras, RECORDING EVERYWHERE (as a mental institution does), and yet nothing, no one is saying \"Hey, there's a knife floating and she's either killing men with her mind, or her story is legit.\" Most of the big twists in the movie or the big shock moments also take place in a public setting, so you're telling me that no one in the restaurant saw a knife floating except for her and her sister? You're telling me they couldn't have shown footage in the restaurant of a floating knife??? Do you mean to tell me that the cops didn't go to check the footage? You're going to tell me they didn't see A F***ING KNIFE FLOATING??? Give me a break from reality, but not this big of a disconnect. Also, why does the little girl believe she hit her when she's clearly on the other side of the room? None of it adds up, the only suspense and disbelief comes from how laughably unbelievable the film is at moments.Also, after she shoots and stabs the suit, how would it just blink and go in and out? That's literally not how it would work, once she disconnects/destroys a camera it would act more like a dead pixel that would be constant, it wouldn't make half of the suit blink, did no one explain how electric current and cameras work? Drab. The best way to describe this movie is by calling a drab, drag-fest that goes on for what feels like a f***ing eternity, my theater had people walking out or laughing during highly suspenseful and intelligent dialogue such as \"He's invisible! It means you can't see him!!!\" I mean, wow, so profound, thank you for defining the meaning of \"invisible\", I really needed help on that! I'm not sure how this movie has such high ratings, it was just plain-out bad and predictable at every point. Though the writing doesn't treat the audience as poorly as the writers did in The Dead Don't Die (where they explain the f***ing plot and 'hidden' meaning on multiple occasions), it still feels insulting when they introduce us to plot points that just make literally no sense, and that's the problem with The Invisible Man, it almost makes no sense from start to finish. I also feel like the twist where it was his brother was meant to make us think \"Oh my God! What if it wasn't him!!!!\" but, tbh, at that point, I was so f***ing checked out of the movie I was only thinking \"Jesus f***ing Christ, it's going to keep going for another f***ing 40 minutes.\""}, {"rating": "9", "text": "I have to admit my expectations were a bit on the high side walking into this one. Although normally I try to keep them in check because so many movies are utterly disappointing. Well I'm happy to say this film completely blew me away. Leigh Whanell has created his masterpiece. A superb update inspired by the invisible man but something completely new altogether. The brilliant Elizabeth Moss stars as Cecelia a damaged woman in an abusive, controlling marriage. As we begin the film she escapes and soon after finds that her ex has committed suicide. Following that she discovers that she will inherit five million dollars as long as she doesn't commit any crimes or is ruled mentally incompetent. All of that is a red herring for what's to come. Soon after she comes to realize that her new found freedom is an illusion and that her sociopathic ex is stalking her but is invisible. I don't want to get into the details because I refuse to spoil this for anyone but wow. From the opening moments Whannel concocts a mounting feeling of chest tightening dread and keeps it uncomfortably fluid throughout. The small moments of laughter and a feeling of freedom are only to distract you from what's coming. And trust me it's worth the wait. The film unfolds unexpectedly is utterly driven by Moss's vulnerable yet resilient performance. She's so smart and driven it's easy to root for her and to relate to her seemingly hopeless plight. The film succeeds in establishing Adrian as an utter monster. And the invisibility is a device that works so well because had he been given a steady face and performance, it would have humanized him. And it's all the more effective that it didn't. Despite being a reimagining this is a really new film. It feels fresh in every aspect and even though you might think you know what's going to happen the utter brilliance in which it's executed is utterly astounding."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I liked the movie a lot.

Fun Fact: this was originally going to be the second movie in the cinematic universe \"Dark Universe\" with Johnny Depp playing the titled character. However, the flop of the Mummy seems to have made Universal focus on standalone Universal monster movies. This new strategy seems to be the right move as The Invisible Man is an absolute thrill of a movie. The general summary of this movie is that Cecilia (Elisabeth Moss) who has escaped an abusive relationship from her ex Adrian (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) only for weeks later to find out he committed suicide. However, she suspects his death was a hoax and that she is being hunted by someone nobody can see.The biggest praise of this movie has got to be Elisabeth Moss performance.She gives an authentic performance of a character who has been in an abusive relationship.She makes the emotional stakes feel high and her agony feel genuine. However, she is also able to give a ferocity in her performance when her character decides to fight. She does an incredible job in carrying this movie. The score by Benjamin Wallfisch is also incredibly unsettling and intense when it needs to be. It manages to perfectly elevate the scene in every way and really make the audience invested what they are watching. I also have to praise their unique use of camera shots. The director Leigh Whannell uses a lot of wide shots and panning to make it really feel like there is someone else in the room watching our character Cecilia. The story is also really engaging and is a really smart narrative on woman who have been abused or manipulated. The movie has great scares and great suspenseful moments that are not just relying on jump scares(but there are some) and it is just a breath of fresh air for a horror movie.This isn't the director's fault but the trailers kind of ruin a fair amount of the surprise sadly. I highly recommend people don't watch the trailer for this movie cause it will lessen the experience. My biggest issue with this movie is just the amount of plot holes that really make me question things. I will avoid spoiler territory. The first thing I have to question is the lack of cameras? There are security cameras in this world and this movie emphasises cameras but when there is a scene that 100% would have security cameras in the real world, the movie decides it doesn't exist anymore. Also I have to question how a certain character is able to get to get from point a to point b so quick when there is clearly no transportation used by this character. Additionally, this character somehow knows where everyone is just baffling and unexplained. You have to suspend some of your belief to accept these and unfortunately that is kinda difficult especially considering the tech shown in this movie. The last act of this movie also feels really contrasting to the the slower and suspenseful pace of the first two acts of this movie and it kinda makes it feel like a completely different movie. Honestly, I also prefer the first two acts compared to the last one. Overall, this movie is just a great horror movie and a fresh contemporary adaptation of the novel. If you want a unique and vastly different horror movie experience then this movie is a must watch for you."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Over the past few years, Blumhouse Productions has become a money machine, offering low-budget, pulpy horror films (the \u201cPurge\u201d series, \u201cTruth or Dare,\u201d \u201cHappy Death Day,\u201d among others) that do very well at the box office.  In fairness, they\u2019ve also bankrolled serious theatrical efforts like \u201cGet Out\u201d and \u201cBlacKkKlansman.\u201d  \u201cThe Invisible Man\u201d moves Blumhouse outside the traditional horror genre.  It\u2019s a film that is part horror film, part action movie, part support for #MeToo.The concept behind this film originated with the 1897 novella \u201cThe Invisible Man\u201d by H.G. Wells, generally acknowledged as the father of science fiction.  This film also owes a debt to the 1933 film with the same name, starring Claude Rains.In the hands of Writer/Director Leigh Whannell (the \u201cSaw\u201d series), the content and focus of this movie is changed dramatically from the original source material.  In fact, the man we sometimes can\u2019t see is actually only a tangential character in the story.  The protagonist is Cecelia Kass (Elisabeth Moss), the long-suffering live-in partner of a rich genius who works in field of optics.  A total control freak, the optics inventor has abused Cecelia in every way imaginable.  After escaping from the fenced-in fortress where she lives with this madman, Cecelia is further persecuted by a series of mysterious events.  Her former boyfriend has donned a body suit that refracts light, rendering him invisible as he performs a series of increasingly horrific misdeeds.   Blood flows. Cecelia is accused of madness and murder.  The game is afoot, Watson.What makes this film rise about the typical Blumhouse dreck is Elisabeth Moss, who has had memorable roles in several iconic TV series including \u201cWest Wing,\u201d \u201cMad Men,\u201d \u201cTop of the Lake,\u201d and most recently \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u201d  Here, Moss offers an acting tour de force.  Her character evolves from terrorized abuse victim to action figure to cold-blooded avenging angel.  As her character transforms, Moss\u2019 facial expressions and body language also evolve strikingly.  If you can get past all the blood, it\u2019s an evolution worth watching.Because this is Blumhouse, who gave us masterpieces such as \u201cThe Gallows Act II\u201d (a record-tying 0% on Rotten Tomatoes) and the currently-playing \u201cFantasy Island\u201d (checking in at 9%), effective plotting is not a strong point in \u201cThe Invisible Man.\u201d  For example, while housed on a secure psychiatric ward, Cecelia simply opens the unlocked door to the stairwell, helpfully labelled \u201cEmergency Exit,\u201d to make her escape.  Some of the plot twists made me yearn for the GEICO commercial with the immortal line, \u201cLet\u2019s hide behind the chain saws!\u201d\u201cThe Invisible Man\u201d is a worthy addition to the pulp noir genre.  With no particular skills, Moss\u2019 character overcomes impossible odds to preserve her sanity and right wrongs.  Along the way, the cinematography is notably flashy and fascinating.  However, it\u2019s Moss, and Moss alone, who elevates this film and makes the whole endeavor worthwhile."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "The sound and the content is so so amazing. If you want to watch something surprise, you must go to the cinema and watch this movie."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "Two of js went to see this movie, and two of us enjoyed it.  Elizabeth Moss is terrific as an abused wife who plans and executes her escape from her abusive husband.  Just when she thinks her troubles are over, she finds out they are not.  Loved the way things built up over the course of a tight timeframe.  Of course, it is frustrating when no one will believe her.  A couple of scenes where I had to cover my eyes.  But, overall, great suspense, a talented leading lady and a good supporting cast.  Very engrossing!"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "The teachings of H.G. Wells are stretched to their \"2020-iest,\" and followers of the adaptation process's limitless possibilities have yet another feather in their cap in the form of Leigh Whannell's \"The Invisible Man,\" an ambitious, imaginative and twisted return to form for one of Universal's underappreciated \"monster\" properties. Whannell capitalizes and even improves on everything that surprised me about his last entry, \"Upgrade,\" distributing the kinetics of his film in a more even and structurally friendly fashion, using the frame as an antagonist that's just as terrifying to look at as it is impossible to look away from. The narrative is sumptuously deceiving, yet structurally recognizable enough to make you think you know where things are headed, even though the exact destination isn't where you figured you'd end up. The production design and cinematography are sleek, ultimately pairing with the respective looks of his previous films to give Whannell what I'd even call an aesthetic in the making. And though it really shocks me to say it, I find myself really intrigued at the prospect of more Universal monster movies with this treatment of the source material in mind. I'd consider that a success on the part of those involved."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Really good thriller. Did not expect it to be as good as it turned out to be.

The characters often fall into classically poor horror movie decision-making, but it's not enough to take away from the overall impact of the film."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Great movie, to turn the original story into a feminist manifest is brilliant and touthfull. Moss is superb."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "A solid 7/10 and deserves a watch.
