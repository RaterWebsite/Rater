It was so bad that everyone in the theater was actually chatting/whispering instead of watching it about 30 minutes in. I can only recommend this movie to people who enjoy torturing themselves."

      "text": "There's a decent little story at the core of this movie. The family drama primarily deals with a family's struggle when one of their kids is diagnosed with cancer. The strongest aspect is definitely the mother's love and strength while dealing with her son's ever-worsening condition. It tries some other stuff like the grief-ridden alcoholic father angle, but the rest of it is underdeveloped. Even the 'barely scrapping by' element gets lost at some point. Strong performances make up for the fact that this is barely above Lifetime original movie quality in terms of production. You can tell there wasn't much money funneled into this. What really holds The Haunting in Connecticut back is that it's so generic as a horror movie. Every trick it has up it's sleeve has been seen elsewhere countless times before. Never before has a house filled with dead people felt so lifeless. Far from the first horror movie to boast that it's \"based on a true story,\" the plot here serves as an example of why not many people actually believe in this stuff. First off the supposed actual events themselves have been met with much scrutiny. I doubt this movie, which supposedly deviates even farther from reality than the book, will do anything to persuade people otherwise. You can literally see in every scene how the family could have faked the entire thing. The way any and all evidence to support their claims was lost at the end of the movie is all too convenient. The extra added monologue where the mother character says that doesn't she doesn't care whether the audience believes her or not because she knows what happened only makes it harder to take any of it seriously. Just going off of this movie, I've got to say I think the story is complete crap.So many overused scare tactics have been borrowed here to no avail. It also ruins the already shaky credibility of the so-called \"true haunting.\" There is a little something here in terms of a surprisingly great cast and likable family drama that brings actual emotion to the table. Something is largely in part due to the excellent performances from Virginia Madsen and Kyle Gallner as the two leads. Unfortunately those elements are kind of wasted in such a bland and dull horror movie. It's a bunch of borrowed parts that were taken from better and much scarier films. You should go watch one of those instead."

By telling me that it is based on a true story it set my expectations very high. For a true story I expected the realism to be REAL. You know, something I could believe. Well this movie was anything but realistic. It was typical Hollywood.We found ourselves laughing through 95% of this movie. Watching this and trying to believe that it really happened to someone was hysterical. We couldn't stop giggling. Nice try Hollywood, but this was a NO GO!! Scary??? NOT!!! hilarious?? ABSOLUTELY! Rent this one if you want a good laugh fest."

And on that level, it delivers the shocks and scares better than any of the horror movies I've seen in the theatre in the last year. Sure, anyone familiar with horror film tropes will experience a distinct sense of deja vu, and anyone who's seen The Amityville Horror, with which this movie's inspiration shares many real-world connections, will connect the dots between that movie's plot and this one's, but Haunting manages to bring the scares without being a remake of something done in America in the 80's or in Japan in the 90's. Surely that counts for something."

      "text": "So this probably won't go in the Hall of Fame for film ingenuity, but as the modern horror film that it is, it delivers a very intriguing plot that really caught my attention. The characters were mostly pretreated beautifully, except for a couple times when their actions were a bit predictable. I honestly love this movie because it doesn't solely rely on blood and guts to deliver a good shiver, it creeps you out with ghosts and real life experiences that can be more relevant to people's lives (therefore more believable and creepier). I would strongly recommend for people to watch this."

However, the wonderful acting and the outstanding effects leave it out of the trash heap. I personally liked the double-take disappearances throughout the movie by the soon-to-die child, it gave a creepy air to it but still left the predictability o f any old haunted house movie. I can't say anything about the ending, though, because I left the theater before it came around, so I'll assume it was the same old \"happily ever after\" tale."

I thought this one was up there with Amityville, if not creepier, so I'm not sure where the negative comparisons come from. Amityville's plot line is quite a bit different than this one (actually to be honest they aren't even remotely similar), which makes me wonder how many critics even watched the damned movie. Apparently if it is in a house, and people died, and its scary, then it must be an Amityville rip-off, right?"

      "text": "Priests err. The priest in Peter Hyams' \"End of Days\" corrects the biggest clergical error of them all: the sign of the devil was misread(\"666\" is actually \"999\" upside-down). When the priest in \"The Haunting in Connecticut\" realizes his own error, he calls the family and leaves a message on their answering machine. It's only natural that the urgent transmission goes unheard. The message itself has a self-relexive quality WHICH deconstructs the horror sub-genre that is the haunted house flick. Reverend Propescu's words are plain-old common sense, but the characters that inhabit these fatalistic diegeses are stuck in a circumstantial paradox. If these non-people behaved in a rational manner, the narrative would be over before the first reel. In this case, we'd miss out on the supernatural hurl. It's bad enough that Matt(Kyle Gallner) insists on sleeping in the same room where the ghosts without eyelids regularly scare the bejesus out of him, but his sister Wendy(Amanda Crew) takes the customary lobotomized thrill-seeking nonchalance of haunted house victimization to the next level. Unfazed by the systematic decomposition of all the house's perishables, Wendy takes a shower, where the unflappable girl seemingly starts a fight with the shower curtain. And still Wendy won't leave the goddamn house. Once the ghosts can't be allocated solely to the mental sphere; a mere psychosomatic reaction towards Matt's cancer-fighting drugs, the Campbells need to make like the Lutzs and flee. The family's painfully slow-reaction time to the obvious dangers of the house, makes \"The Haunting in Connecticut\" increasingly convoluted as the facts about their home stack up like a hundred dead textual bodies."

It also had one of my most hated plot devices, an old spiritual person who meets the main character in the middle of the movie and seems to know everything about everything. The movie follows its own internal logic to a degree until it's time to throw in the twist, at which point all of that gets thrown out the window. Unsurprisingly, the elder expert who was completely wrong about everything up to this point as it turns out suddenly knows... exactly what's going on! Skip it."

      "text": "This is a pretty standard jump scare haunted house movie.  The acting isn't horrible but it's nothing to write home about.  The movie plays up the based on the true story angle but if you watch the special features on the DVD you learn that the vast majority of this movie is fiction.  The biggest example being the burning of the home at the end.  It never burned down... ever, yet the end of the movie says that the house was \" rebuilt and resold\".  Somebody does live in it now but it never burned to the ground or had the dead no decomposed bodies built into the walls.  So taking that in to effect we see that the movie isn't really based on the true story making it just another cookie cutter haunted house film full of predictable jump scares.  This is a good movie for middle school and high school kids to start their interests in horror movies."

The plot tells the story of Matt Campbell, being a cancer patient, is forced to move to a location that is close to the hospital in Connecticut. Arriving at the house Matt realizes that there are presences but that only he can see. The film is a great underrated horror where there is an air of anxiety thanks to the excellent actors and scenes of fear that never exaggerate."

      "text": "I thought the acting was pretty decent and as such, I feel quite bad rating it 5/10, but for me, this was one of those films that you forget after it's finished. I think the reason behind it being so forgettable is pretty simple: the film relied almost 100% on jump scares and so once you've scared the crap out of the person sitting next to you by unexpectedly jumping out of your seat and perhaps needing a quick underwear change, you pretty much instantly forget that moment where something big and scary was loudly thrust into your face. A phrase that could quite easily be misinterpreted...anyway! On the whole, it was okay. Although it was, in a way, pretty inevitable I did find the ending quite disappointing. This film was in no way subtle or clever enough to really scare me and stick in my mind, hence the fairly low score. But it was relatively entertaining, it wasn't a monumental waste of time and it would be a fairly decent choice with a few friends over."

Also it is good for horror films to scare  a thing that this movie doesn't. It is annoying and boring and there is not actually a perk of  watching that film.

      "text": "I'm getting convinced that horror cinema has been so exploited that it's getting more difficult to do something new or original. This movie reinforces that thought a little bit because it doesn't bring anything new but still works well enough. The screenplay is based on another case of haunting studied by Ed and Lorraine Warren, as well as other films like \"Conjuring\" or \"Amityville Horror\". But as in these films, this script has little reality and immense imagination for dramatic effects (well... truth about the actual case portrayed in this film is still controversial today). Despite this and the abundant use of clich\u00e9s that we are tired of seeing in other films, it works, causing some scares and, above all, a pleasant feeling of discomfort and tension. The script is easy to describe: in order to be closer to the hospital where their child is treating cancer, a family moves to a new home in Connecticut. However, the house they decide to rent was used in the past as a funeral parlor, and there were also spiritist sessions and black magic.The family drama is very well introduced at the beginning of the film and is being developed in conjunction with the beginning of the strange events in the house, so we never get the feeling that everything was just a pretext to introduce a friendly family in a diabolical house ready to kill them all. In the middle of the movie we feel like we are very close to the end ... and that would probably be true if this movie were like many others, where the whole story is just a pretext for a mind-boggling journey of predictable scares in a weird house. It's not like this here... when we think it's all over, things really start to get interesting. The end of the movie makes use of a plot twist but it's not really shocking or unpredictable. Concerning the actors, I have to say that I hardly know them... Kyle Gallner is a good actor and shows talent, although he is still very young. Elias Koteas was also quite competent."
