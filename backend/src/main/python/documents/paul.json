But when he worries he\u2019s outlived his usefulness and the dissection table is drawing uncomfortably close, Paul escapes on the first RV that passes by his compound in Area 51.

There are alot of funny scenes in the film and the story is enjoyable to watch. My only problem with the film is some scenes in my opinion are just stupid overall. I would give this a high matinee!"

Without the director of Shaun and Hot Fuzz on board, the only loss I could see was lack of a definite visual style but honestly, it didn't stop the laughs coming.  Biggest complaint I had was Simon Pegg's Moustache!  It hid his top lip and hence a lot of subtle looks he was giving."

Paul is the story of two friends, Graeme (Simon Pegg) and Clive (Nick Frost) who are going on a tour across america, from Comic-Con to all over america's alien hotspots. Along the way, they come across an alien named Paul (voiced by Seth Rogen) Let me get this out of the way: Just because the two main characters are \"nerds\" doesn't mean anyone who isn't one will be alienated. The jokes are crude, often come flying fast and there's enough within this movie so everyone will be entertained, including car chases, romance subplots, star wars (amongst other films) references and explosions. The jokes can often be crude, yes, but there's no doubt about how many laughs inhabit each joke: they're full of them. From probing gags to tri-titted aliens, this film is certainly a barrel full of laughs (there are better jokes, but its hard to speak of them without spoiling parts of the movie). There are a few jokes where you just have to give yourself a second to process what the character just said, and when you have processed what they just said, trust me, you'll be laughing. This film proudly bears its inspirations, by homaging some films which, trust me, once you hear them, you'll get the homage. The best homage? Listen to the background music when the characters enter the redneck bar, you'll see. Also, once Sigourney Weaver makes her on screen appearance, wait for a certain line to be referenced. I can't talk about this movie without mentioning the films title character: Paul. Seth Rogens voice doesn't bother me in any way, in fact, his voice seems perfectly suited for the CGI character, who does not stick out like a sorethumb like certain cgi-characters *cough*ScoobyDoo*cough* In fact, all of the characters are quite well done characters, none feeling like merely one dimensional characters, whether its Jane Lynch's alien enthusiast waitress, or David Koenchers redneck who severly dislikes the title characters, they also manage to pull of some brilliant laughs. A great deal of the laughs have to come from the Goverment agents, played by Bill Hader and Lo Trugillo. The duo give us some big laughs, whether its about 'Spacemans balls', searching the main characters RV or within a comic book store, you can expect big laughs from these two. Paul manages to go in a direction that i'm glad it touched upon, the creationism VS evolution debate. With Paul suddenly here, it fuels the debate (not through the whole movie though) and ponders the idea of what to do when you're beliefs have been shattered. So basically, Paul is a film filled with non-stop laughs, a brilliant cast who could act their way out of a prison and homages that are guarranteed to leave a smile on your face. Definately a contender for funniest film of the year"

The Seth Rogen reached his zenith with his performances in the TV comedy of some years ago \"Freaks and Geeks\"  which matched him and many of the better comedy actors populating films today.  Unfortunately Apto and his young charges have steadily faulted in downward trends.  Rogen has played the exact same character just stoned more or less in preceding roles.  Stop smoking the props stop smoking your own stash and start learning your craft these past several performances have been terrible \"The Green Hornet\" OUCH!"

Throw in the genius of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, and it's a no-brainer.  No, Paul won't win any Oscars, nor does it teach us anything new.  However, it takes us on a fun journey in a race to get Paul home, all the while throwing nostalgia at the viewer, especially if the viewer grew up in the 80s.  Some blatant references to Star Wars, ET, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, etc., but then some subtle ones, like the country jamboree band playing the Star Wars Cantina theme ala Western style.  Jason Bateman was perfect as Agent Zoil.  Lorenzo Zoil.  So stupid, yet hysterical.  Wonderful writing, acting and full of surprises.  Paul is a MUST SEE!"

These 2 guys are good, but given the brilliant set up - british dudes & alien road movie in america's west - the story could have been much more gritty, unusual, eccentric, weird & inventive. you kinda get the feeling that director Greg Mottola's great instincts as director got dulled & dumbed down to pulp by the universal's tsunami of dreary. Feels like a kid's movie with a lot of been-there-100,000-times cliche Seth Rogen riffs... like insert curse, blah blah blah, insert curse... rinse, repeat. Should have used someone unexpected like George Clooney, who could've pulled this off with a lot more quirky intelligence & wittiness (like in Mr. Fox). Movie is weighed down by Seth Rogen, who's a good actor but has way way way way way way overplayed this schtick. You kinda get the feeling that Mottola got highjacked & maybe got stuffed in the trunk while this movie went down the highway. Don't think he wrote this but if he did, it got shredded -- could have been a lot funnier and more insightful, with a lot fewer unbelievably obvious cliches that make a big deal of being obvious so that it's like kitchy obvious as \"cool\" obvious... but totally fails in that sense, like the evangelical thing. Aside from all that, I had like 7-10 out loud laughs, and that was well worth it. Final: funny, but nowhere near as good as the story idea makes you believe."

      "text": "Deep in the recesses of an Area 51 warehouse, a CIA-employed \"little green man\" has none other than Steven Spielberg on the line, discussing with the filmmaker, hot on the heels of his first Indiana Jones movie, what he should film next. Seated at his regulation government desk, Paul(Seth Rogen), the driving force behind all the important scientific and sociological achievements of the past fifty years, gives Spielberg the idea for \"E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial\", the 1982 classic that turns out to be, not a work of fiction, but a biopic about Paul's first contact with earthlings upon his arrival from the skies beyond. Clive Gollings(Nick Frost), a British sci-fi writer on nerd holiday with his fellow Comic-Con conventioneer Graeme(Simon Pegg), had no doubt seen \"E.T.\" as a tiny lad in some rundown London bijou, but it's the Spielberg knockoff \"Mac & Me\", the 1988 Stewart Raffill \"commercial\" that took the marketing practice of product placement to a whole other level, which inspired him down the road to write speculative fiction and sci-fi based comic books. Considering that Paul has such a prodigious grasp of the American popular culture(he takes credit for creating Fox Mulder), the savvy moviegoer would expect the hyper-urban alien to be outraged when Clive speaks of him in the same light as the \"Mysterious Alien Creature\", Mac for short, whose caretakers keep alive by supplying the co-opted alien with Coke after Coke after Coke. With his mouth fixed in a perpetual \"O\", Mac has the unintended look of a stroke victim. Hillariously, since Mac can't move his mouth, the furnished soda cans are always equipped with a straw for easy sipping, as a means to help offset the considerable limitations of the completely manual puppet. Unlike Mac who can't talk(you need facial gestures to do that), and most conspicuously, eat(ditto), Paul, on the other hand, yet another triumph of CGI technology, acts and sounds like your typical American male beset with arrested development, and in a wicked send-up of the titular character in John Carpenter's \"Starman\", eats what he regenerates. Paul may be a little on the crude side, but he never forgot his first love, Tara, whom the alien tried to make amends with over the intervening years through the cinematic arts. (In a bit of fun, fictive movie revisionism, Elliott was supposedly based on Tara.) Although Paul couldn't save the dog his ship landed on during that long ago crash landing, the alien brings the hound's memory back alive, so to speak, through the redemptive powers of film. In the final moments of \"E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial\", Elliott's dog trots up the ramp to the departing spacecraft, then thinks better of it and turns around. When Tara(Blythe Danner), the little girl who nursed Paul back to health, traverses the same sort of steps(toward Paul's ship) as that celluloidal dog, the seemingly accidental movements of a restless animal in the Spielberg film now takes on a less spontaneous appearance. Turns out the whole damn thing was scripted, a personal aside, from Paul to Tara, as an apology for taking her cherished pet away with his reckless piloting, by foregrounding the dog for a brief moment amidst the tearful goodbyes between E.T. and his humans. \"E.T.\" is a very personal movie for Paul, thus Clive's childhood fascination with \"Mac and Me\"(co-starring Ronald McDonald as himself) must stick in his crawl, but he remains respectfully quiet, perhaps even, suspiciously so. That's because \"Mac & Me\" was his idea too. It's the only explanation. He's just too embarrassed to own up to it. At the end of the Christine Ebersole vehicle, the family of mysterious alien creatures gets sworn in as American citizens, therefore choosing Earth over returning back to their desert-like planet. Paul, who probably could have quit his bureaucratic job anytime he wanted to, decides that he prefers his adopted home, as well. These two movies: \"E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial\" and \"Mac & Me\", reflect the breadth of Paul's earthly experiences; starting off as a stranger in a strange land and ending with a successful transition into fruitful assimilation."

Each scene is punctuated by a poorly-constructed gay joke, and the disembodiment of Seth Rogen's voice is truly unsettling.The film, after the opening scene of Paul's ship landing on a dog, begins with an upbeat musical montage of the main characters, forcing a familiarity of them upon the audience. They then *somehow* acquire an RV, (which they drive as if it were a Honda Civic) in a pursuit of spotting UFOs via a cross-country road trip. Now, add Paul, a gray alien who has escaped the government's clutches,. He makes a rather predictable and unintelligent introduction to our main characters. If Paul is not propaganda to make us believe that the extraterrestrial lifeforms of our universe have the personality and intelligence of any beer-bonging college human \"brah\", then I don't know what it is.From there, the characters' overly-apparent awkward social graces make enemies with everyone they meet. Before long, they have a transcontinental train of gun-toting antagonists following behind them, from homophobic hillbilly redneck hunters, to the FBI. It is unclear what anyone's goal is in this movie - antagonists, protagonists, script writers, producers... what is going on?When the investigators set up a road bock, the scene cuts directly from the officers waving traffic to the side of the road, to their RV immediately being searched, encouraging us to allow our rights to be illegally violated. I digress.Paul finally leaves Earth by signaling his alien brethren to pick him up with... fireworks. This works not only immediately, but also very well, because fireworks haven't been fired anywhere on Earth, at any time in the past 70 years. Plot hole after plot hole, the writers abandon a potential script of substance for a cinematic faux-pas, intentionally created to condition humans to the existence of aliens, which Paul, actually points out at one part in the movie.As for the supposedly spectacular sci-fi references, they were too few to quantify.

I thought this would be funny but if you saw the preview you've already seen the best jokes. harvesting farts not eating a dead bird would have been better as a short rather then an hour and a half of filler and a recycled 3 boobs joke from total recall over and over again. the Christian trailer trash, the English nerd, the stupid alien couldn't be less funny. Seriously this is worse then sucker punch."

But, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are so cool and they actually pretty good job on their role and that CG alien is a wise crack-in hilarious. Cool movie and it's pretty fun alien road trip flick."
