My first reaction was that they were taking a great child hood movie of mine and turning it into a comedy.  After seeing some positive reviews online, I decided to give it a shot. Needless to say, I was thoroughly impressed!    The film was more of a spiritual successor then an actually sequel, and it was not just funny but a well-structured movie.  For someone like myself that has played video games all my life, it was a real treat with all of the game jokes. All of the actors did a great job making this film work, with Jack Black really standing out.  Every scene he was in brought a smile or laughter from me.    If you are a Jumanji purest and want to see a movie similar to the original, you will be probably walk away disappointed. If you throw out preconceived notions and just want a fun & entertaining film, then this is an overall good family film to see. (Slight cursing from Kevin Heart)"

I have no familiarity with video games, and so some of the characters and events were no doubt lost on me.  All four of the principal characters are stereotypes of personalities one can encounter among high school kids, and it was an interesting idea for each of them, once sucked into the game, to be stuck in a body drastically different from the bodies in which they had grown up.  Dwayne Johnson attempted to play the role of a scrawny geek suddenly endowed with an immense, powerful physique; but his acting chops were not sufficient to pull it off.  (Johnson, in every movie of his I have seen, basically plays himself.)  So the movie was by no means great art, but it was lots of fast-paced improbable fun."

Of course as many can tell this was not a sequel and did not feel like a sequel whatsoever, but it was and came off well as a continuation bringing our loved classic into the modern society. The humor was silly and unique, bringing a laugh to so many. The cast was absolutely top-notch and brought their characters forward and sold it despite many opposite traits of the actors and characters. Strong and confident Dwayne Johnson playing a terrified teenager? Jack Black playing a popular teenage girl? There's much more and the performances were just spot on. They tied everything back together just like in any well made movie, and you can't forget the very well written \"Indiana Jones\" feel soundtrack. This film is definitely not one to be forgotten!"

CONS: 1) The villain is incredibly uninspired. 2) The story beats are formulaic (no surprise, there, but hey, I gotta mark it zero, dude). 3) I know this is pedantic, but most video games do not have playable characters that have no offensive skills in a clearly adventure-based game."

What they discover is that you don't just play Jumanji--you must survive it. To beat the game and return to the real world, they'll have to go on the most dangerous adventure of their lives, discover what Alan Parrish left 20 years ago, and change the way they think about themselves--or they'll be stuck in the game forever...I liked this movie so much, it's unique and better than the first Jumanji, but Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle isn't a sequel, it stands on it's own.Anyways, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is full of action sequences which were very good, very talented performances in the world of Jumanji, but in the real life, the performances were bad, and it takes to another thing I hated about this movie, I didn't see so much of Jumanji or lots of animals as I expected to see. The CGI of the animals wasn't that good anyway. The story is really good, I loved every sequence of this movie, it's like video game but a movie, I loved it! The sense of humor of this movie is really funny, I liked that , but Kevin Hart with Dwayne Johnson scene was so Central Intelligence, I didn't that, but I laughed though.I liked Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle very much and I'm gonna give it a B+.Thank you, guys as always for reading my review, I hope you liked it, and I welcome all of your comments."

Outside of that though there are a few genuine laughs to be had at this film, mostly curtesy of Jack Black though they are still cheap laughs but laughs all the same. I thought the video game aspects of this game were interesting such as the three lives and the non-playable characters. The villain was incredibly non-existent and it never really felt as though there was much threat to the characters. A decent enough action-comedy but I think the concept could have gone a lot further and produced much better results than it did. Also, ditch Kevin Hart."

It peaks around the middle and then loses some of both the momentum and the plot towards the end.Related media: I have seen the first film on TV, about ten years after it first came out. The plot device was ridiculous but the film was meaningful and interesting. I think Zathura was an unrelated sequel.What's it like?: Four people get sucked into a video game version of Jumanji, a board game, and they have to work together to complete the game before they use up all their lives so that they can return back to the real world.Pros: When these four people were first sucked into the game and they first discover their characters in the game, it was really funny. There a many other funny instances in the film too.Cons: 1) Other than these funny instances, some of both the momentum and the plot are lost towards the end.2) The plot of the game, not the film, is that the villain goes into the jungle of Jumanji to find a green jewel that is embedded into the eye of a giant jaguar statue.  He gets hold of the jewel and is now empowered with the ability to control the jaguars in the jungle. He now plans to use his goons to take control of the surrounding territory. However, the jewel is stolen from him and handed over to these four people so that it can be returned to the jaguar statue. Even so, the villain was still capable of controlling the jaguars after losing the jewel, which doesn't make sense.3) The flow of the film and thus the game felt linear, and that's never a sign of a good game.How would the the different age groups rate it?Children: GoodTeens: GoodYoung adults: GoodMedium age adults: AverageOld adults: AverageRating: 3/5 (no half scores). Save your money and watch it on TV."

Some of the humor is crude and misses the mark, but on the whole the dialogue is witty and the \"Jumanji\" universe created in this film is immersive and fun.

There were a few jokes here and there that were mildly amusing but nothing as funny as what's in the trailer.  Kevin Hart does his typical \"I'm not Chris Tucker, but I act like him\" schtick, Jeff Black was what I imagine a teenage girl would be if she found out she were a guy.  Karen Gillian (sp?) was actually decent here and Dwayne Johnson always makes you love him when he's on screen.  It plays off like a game but after an hour or so, the time was just flying by.  Good enough to spend $14 on for a ticket but don't expect to be laughing too much if you've seen the trailer.  It's still a good movie though and I'm not sorry I went."

Instead of the tender musings on childhood, adulthood, time, and fear that the original possessed, we get some recycled thematics that you can find in any 80's high school flick. Instead of the smart and effective humor that made the original film so entertaining, we get dick jokes. It simply doesn't even flick a booger in the direction of the original. . .but it's still watchable. Yes, even I'll admit - though I wasn't looking forward to this flick at all (and although I still ended up not even liking it that much) it ended up containing a bit more competency than I was expecting. The video-game-isms are entertaining, the lead performances are definitely stimulating, and even though there are still some glaring, fundamental issues with it, \"Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle\" is still somehow worth the watch."

What's literally scratching my head is the fact that I'm searching for the exact reason why Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle needs to even exist. It's just the same thing I have seen in 1995's Jumanji, only a lot more modernized for today's standards because even mentioning the standards of 1995 are no longer relevant as of today according to this movie. I would say that it was a slight improvement of its predecessor, but where in the film am I supposed to know it's a great time to say this is an improvement of the original film without thinking this is exactly like the original film only more modernized? Do I recommend it? I don't know, but all I can say is that if you have not watched 1995's Jumanji, you're safe to go."

Seconds later you have Jumanji, a pleasant mix of all the popular genres of film. It even goes down easy during digestion. 10 out of 10 Stars. Jumanji is a fun romp in the jungle and no one gets hurt, most importantly, so it was brilliant. The jokes about not getting hurt because they play as avatars were stupendously delightful as well as the rest of the humor. The film is packed with non-stop laughs, but it does stop to remind you that a group of friends can work together and beat the system, a tricky video game system called Jumanji."

As soon as the movie starts it has a playful tone that never leaves. It adores it's own characters (probably more than we do), but does justice by each one. Nick Jonas is a welcome unexpected addition to the otherwise publicized cast. Great movie, hits every note it aims for, will be an awesome family outing for Christmas time. Do yourself a favor and go into it about as serious about filmmaking as the filmmakers and you will not be disappointed. It would be a sin to not add that Jack Black aced it!"

      "text": "All wrong,Like its 1995 predecessor (which itself was based on the 1981 children's book of the same name), the new Jumanji movie will revolve a board game that sucks the players into its insane, action-packed world. However, this time around, the protagonists will be four students playing the game while in detention. Once within, they'll be represented by adult avatars, and their mission will be to find a jewel. The movie's main cast includes Dwayne Johnson as Dr. Smolder Bravestone, Kevin Hart as Moose Finbarr, Karen Gillan as Ruby Roundhouse, Jack Black as Professor Shelly Oberon, Ser'Darius Blane as Anthony \"Fridge\" Johnson, Nick Jonas and more."

      "text": "A confectionery sugar rush with a charismatic cast. What impressed me the most is just how well the main cast captured the personalities of their younger costars. We don't get to spend much time with their high-school aged counterparts, but we see enough to know just who they are and understand just how well they nailed their portrayals of them. They seem to be having a lot of fun playing kids out of their depth. Particularly Jack Black who is the highlight of the movie. His character Bethany actually has a really touching character arc while everyone else gets the stereotypical feel good endings.While it never manages to capture the thrill and excitement of watching wild animals tear through a living room like in the original Jumanji, thanks to some impressive action sequences there is plenty of adventure and spectacle to be found inside. It's also very funny. I got plenty of laughs watching these kids freak out over their new bodies and whatever dangers came their way. The gender swap Black's character is going through is used to deliver at least two of the movie's funniest moments. The plot kind of keeps getting in the way though. It's bogged down in too much generic \"be brave and proud of who you are\" moralizing and has plenty of outright painful moments where it tries to explain gamer lingo and modern day teenage lifestyles in an effort to come off as hip and knowledgeable. It just needed to focus on the jokes. The rest of that stuff would have come along the way. While it doesn't hold a candle to our time with Robin Williams in the first Jumanji, \"Welcome to the Jungle\" does provide a good time. Ultimately it was a little more disposable than I was hoping for, but I can't complain too much about the final results as I still ended up having quite a bit of fun with it. I have to say I loved how they managed to make sense of how Jumanji could be a board game in one movie and a video game in the next. It was surprisingly smoothly done. I also appreciate how they managed to bring back and update the 1995 film for a new generation without going the reboot route. 7.7/10"

However, this movie is rife with too many sex and dick jokes which are not funny and not suitable for children. Why are they sexualizing our children?! It's disgusting."
