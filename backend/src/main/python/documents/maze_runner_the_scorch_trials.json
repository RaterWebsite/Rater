I thought the acting was great and they have done a really good job of developing the most important characters from the story.  Now here comes the \"but\".  If you are a huge fan of the book and you get upset and wild when they do not follow the storyline then I would recommend not going to see this.  Rather than make this it's own unique idea they try to make this movie a version of World War Z meets Hunger Games.  They make the cranks out complete zombies when that is not at all what they are.  And right from the beginning the way they enter the Scorch is completely different then the story.  There are characters with them throughout the whole thing that should not be and at the end of it is so completely off base from the original story I honestly have no idea where they are going to go with the next movie.  Also there are characters that need to be immune to make the end game of the entire book series storyline and in this movie they made them not immune.  Again I will say this is a very enjoyable movie on its own just in the context of the entire story as told by the books it is completely off track and doing its own thing."

It involves you into the story making one feel what the characters feel. The struggle they go through just to survive, the feeling of always running, in a way is relatable.

Now they find themselves in the Scorch, a desolate landscape where unimaginable obstacles await. The powerful, mysterious group known as the WCKD seems to be behind it all - and, joining with a group of resistance fighters, the Gladers look for clues behind this sinister organization.\r So I just seen \"Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials\" and it was pretty average. Theses a lot of things that I liked in the movie and these a lot I didn't like. Dylan O'Brine did a decent job playing the main lead in the movie, as he basically carried this whole movie just like in the first movie. The first 20 minutes of this movie was pretty dam good and I was very engaged on what was happening on screen. The action scenes and the cinematography in the movie was pretty damn good. This is a good looking but at the same time cruel looking movie.\r Now for the bad: The movie is a bit predictable at times even in it's action scenes and the story itself. The movie dose feel rushed at times with are main characters quickly going to one place to the other just like that, and I think it's something to do with it's pasting as it jumps ahead a lot.\r I didn't mind some of the CGI when it was used best in the backgrounds of a clear view of the waste land, but the cgi used on the creatures looked extremely fake and completely took me out of the movie. Of course the movie ends on that 'you got to wait for that third one', dick tease that everyone doesn't question why movies have to end like that.\r Overall Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials was a decent watch. It wasn't that bad as some critics have been pointing it out to be. If you have interest in seeing the film I say \"see it\", if not then \"skip it\"."

      "text": "A sequel so full of plot holes, hampered by clich\u00e9d writing, it's hard to imagine how this would succeed. Well, here's the answer: it didn't. The original was an immensely entertaining YA affair, with some exposition  and underdeveloped characters, but the cinematography was stunning and the action sequences (nicely directed by Wes Ball) were fast-paced. All in all, I gave it a 6/10 for sheer entertainment, but didn't hold me as much other genre films like Hunger Games, for example. The sequel does little to improve on it, unsurprisingly, and some appreciated characters from the first didn't get enough focus in this one, and that annoyed me. If there's the worst thing I would point out is the zero character development \"Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials\" has. Honestly, there's no longer a reason as to why it has that title. There were no mazes, just running from Guards, running from zombies (oh my God, do not get me started on the name they gave them), running from lightning, running from everything. There was too far much running than it was necessary. Not helping matters is Kaya Scodelario's performance as Teresa. She isn't convincing nor her character's reasons. There's a reason as to why she betrays her friends, and it doesn't make any sense. It's like the writers don't know what do with her anymore.\r Assuredly, there were a lot of stunning production settings and action sequences, but it's not on par with its predecessor, and ultimately makes for a very disappointing time in cinema this year.\r Final Score: 4.5/10"

Probably those teens who are put through situations and keep going through them like they are made of cardboard.

The movie steals from all sources of modern cinema only to display cliches upon a cardboard feel like movie.\r But just all the directing of the movie is pretentious, pretending to be good and glorifying itself on doing something expensive but empty. Pretending that putting some dramatic music ad nauseam makes the movie tense. It doesn't.\rIt just shows the guys behind the direction of this movie have no real ideas, though arguably a bit of talent, beyond some wannabe hype."

The Scorch Trials follows Thomas and co. after they have exited the Glade and eventually find themselves in an even more hostile environment, the Scorch. If the environment doesn't kill them, the Cranks will, zombie-like people who have contracted an apocalyptic virus. This movie deviates significantly from its predecessor; while The Maze Runner was an intense sci-fi mystery, The Scorch Trials is an action-packed thriller bent on making your pulse race from start to finish. It lacks the mystery of the first film, but the sequel makes up for it with the unpredictable and thrilling plot and visceral action scenes. It also packs a strong emotional punch. All the returning characters have been nicely developed while new characters bring exciting changes to series' pace and style, so when the final act goes completely insane, you'll really feel for what these characters go through. By improving almost every aspect of The Maze Runner, The Scorch Trials becomes the rare sequel that is better than its predecessor, and I eagerly await the next installment."

Personally, this film is just riding the wave of all possible trends: the young adults, the zombies, the post apocalyptic world... the only one that's missing is the love story, which I believe will spring in full bloom in the next chapter.\r The film is utterly disconnected from the first one, and it doesn't feel at all like a continuation. It would have been okay if they released it after a couple of months, but it's been a full year, and the material in the Maze Runner was so boring and clich\u00e9 I was forgetting it while I was watching it.  Granted I have a bias against these kinds of genres, and an even bigger one against sequels, but The Scorch Trials relies on some very weak premises and seems to be going towards very weak conclusions as well."

As an adult, I don't know what to expect from it, but entertainment was the priority. The first film was just an introduction that happened in a small and a single location like the film 'Cube'. Now it has outspread in a large extent with more new characters and takes a wider adventure in the wastelands.\r Many doubts from the previous film were cleared, yet a few need to be clarified and hoping for the next one to do that job. But anyway the suspense was this franchise's specialty, that simply reminds us the TV series 'Lost'. This second part can be compared with plenty of other post apocalyptic films, but still I liked it better than the first.\r The best thing was they retained the same director and he's going to be here for the next film as well. But I'm more interested in the prequel, I mean the fourth film than the third which brings an end to the story moving forward. Because the maze holds the key for many unresolved issues. So I'm anticipating the prequel trilogy than the current one to learn how it all began.\r Surprisingly, many new additions like zombies, bounty hunters in the mainstream boosted the film with its variety. Gives us a creepy atmosphere, along thrilling running and chasing. The twist was not that great, but kind of unpredictable, and again due to the mysteries surrounding it, it created more curious about what might happen next.\r 6\u00bd/10"

It tries really hard to force emotional situations on you (similar to the other stupid series, Mockingjay or whatever it is called), and you are expected to care because... well the music is sappy lol.\r The story reveals what the disease from the 1st movie was talking about. Turns out, its a zombie apocalypse and of course, the wolverine clone is the cure.

Some Fail epicly, such as the dreadful 'Mortal Instruments' movie and 'Eragon'. Some dont hurt as much, such as the better but equally failing adaptation of 'I Am Number Four'. I could go on.\r The Maze Runner is the latest feature to fall into that pattern. The movie made big money in its first three days of original release. So I ran to see what all the fuss was about. I came out extremely satisfied and so surprised at the quality of Director Wes Balls take on the novels by James Dashner, that I immediately started yelling at all my friends and family to go and see it. Most of them were not disappointed either.\r Then comes 'The Scorch Trials' Released exactly one year and one day after the originals release. Starring the surviving members of the original film as seen below. Dylan O'Brien returns as Thomas (keep an eye out for in his next Film 'Deepwater Horizon' Based on the an offshore Oil Rigg Explosion which created the largest oil spill in U.S. History) and my favourite Kay Scodelario (Tv's Skins). A big mention goes to the amazing young actor Jacob Lofland, who plays 'Aris Jones' who was amazing here and in his previous film 'MUD'.\r The film picks up almost moments after the initial film ended. Leaving the Maze and The Grievers behind. The kids are taken back by 'Janson' Played by Game Of Thrones 'Aidan Gillen' to what seems like a safe zone away from the now barren wastelands of Earth, which have been destroyed by The Scorch. The Scorch being a tremendously fierce and frightening storm that basically melts away and destroys nearly anything it touches. Also being kept at bay is what seems like infected humans, almost zombie like creatures that remain on the outside. Who doesn't like a good zombie chase drama? It should be all happy days and new beginnings for the group. Only to find out something W.C.K.D is still coming.\r Suffice to say it all starts a mostly brilliant 'On The Run' action movie. Amazing set pieces, music and of course most of the main cast of actors bring what they need to. Most of the new ones feel a little like left overs. Either it is them, or its the new script writer. The first half is brilliant and for me, sadly, the second half just doesn't hold up to the originals thrilling and intense mystery sideshow. Introducing too many factions and characters and losing the eerie 'Everyone is possibly dead or dying' feel. Even with its slight throw of a boomerang towards the end, that, anyone can see coming from a mile away. There were some truly horrific and scary scenes that, i am glad i did not bring my 'ready and willing' 8 year old along to. In the end however, what we have is a fun, serviceable sequel, that leaves it wide open for what will no doubt be the third, final act (chopped into two I am sure). There are 5 Books overall I believe.\r Quite frankly this series will probably end up being an exciting watch together when they are all complete. For now we have to play the waiting game and even though I will see the eventual sequel and where it goes, I don't quite feel I need to. Which leaves me feeling a little down after the amazing start this series had."

It's a long journey, they're tired, there's bad conditions.... speed it up please. And it's not like there was any important dialogue going on either. Just a mention that the main character was the reason for all this bad but it wasn't elaborated on by the girl. The viewer then knew of course that it would be brought up later in a big plot twist.... blegh. Then the dumbness of the characters which was frustrating. In the first movie we were under the impression they were very smart, then all of a sudden they're talking loudly and banging things around zombies... really? And that scene where they are underground and they are talking where it is echoing with the flashlights... I kinda wanted the zombies to eat them. But. It's a good series.

Also another cheap trick is to cast Game of Thrones actors to get an extra audience but could it really work to see an actor play highly techno role (although without any importance) whom you have seen in cloak and pre-historic era. Scorch does not clarifies what is the object of the kids running, I was left amazed at the selfishness of the character. What is wrong in sacrificing yourself to find a cure. And a little background, why were those all kept in Maze in previous movie, to find out what ?if they are immune? how would have it worked.

I found it to be a worthy successor to the 1st film which I have seen 3 times. The story while different from the 2nd book in many facets also plays nicely with the 1st movie. The acting is Amazing and my favorite character in the book Jorge played by Giancarlo Esposito was Fantastic. The action was extremely well done and very riveting. The enemies which everyone should know by now if you have read the books or seen the trailers are a mix between \"28 Days Later\" & \"World War Z\". I will move onto my 2nd opinion of the story which when comparing it to the book is very different and there are certain scenes from the book that I wish they had included in the film but it is what it is regardless from that it moved along just fine. I would recommend this movie for sure if you're a fan of the books or even the movie.

Book adaptations usually bomb, but films such as The Hunger Games and The Fault In Our Stars had the power and punch that movies like The Maze Runner and Divergent lacked. Scorch Trials was a 2 hour race that would eventually end in a rancid love triangle. The action was dumbed down and nothing special. If there is something that Trials did well was the beautiful cinematography and Dylan O Brian's punchline acting. The movie is left in dust, but the ambitious Brian and the EXCELLENT cinamtography still don't make this a worthwhile theatre watch. Nonetheless, if you have a sweet home theatre, rent the film and be amazing by the beauty."

      "text": "In the original film, Dylan O\u2019Brien and his friends made it out of the deadly maze. This sequel picks up as they find themselves with a new set of challenges in a perilous \"scorched\" landscape. They spend most of the movie running from the evil military scientists, zombies and miscellaneous rogue outliers. Although action is plentiful, not much of it is particularly memorable (the slanted skyscraper is the only exception). There are also mysteries to unfold, which add more questions than answers. For those who've read the novels or enjoy seeing plucky teens fight for their lives, there's an adequate amount of activity."

      "text": "A great sequel and I highly recommend.\r The original was amazing and this one picked up right after the first. The story flowed well, characters were developing while introducing new ones and expanded the world in which we knew very little of from the first.\r Sure there were a few parts where you will be like um... only a idiot will touch that... and he does..\r But, other than that.. great movie and recommend if you are a fan of the first one."

The film figures also do not offer not enough depth around the film like a forever extended wine to let look."

I would subtract another 10 points for that \"young adult\" recipe they are trying to force feed us, but I already reached zero. Not watching the next movie."
