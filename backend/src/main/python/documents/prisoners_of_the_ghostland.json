      "text": "An intriguing pairing of Nicolas Cage and one of Japan's most notoriously wild directors that seemed poised to be the next Mandy. Playing out like a live-action oddball anime, this samurai western black comedy can certainly be delightfully strange at times. Yet, what keeps it from reaching the same heights as other of the Matchstick Men star's wackier outings like, say, Willy's Wonderland is that its peculiarity is really all it has to offer.Sion Sono was intent on packing every scene with as many eccentric sights as possible, so there's always something interestingly bizarre to look at and I was left consistently impressed by his ability to direct such elaborate clutters of madness. The vast majority of it though occurs without meaning. An enticingly goofy opening gives way to a lengthy middle portion where the plotting hits a brick wall and only a few noteworthy moments can be found (all of which involve the lead's ballsack), before eventually picking up again in the action-packed finale. This causes the curious flourishes and outlandish visuals to often feel like filler content designed to pad out the length rather than anything of actual significance. Particularly inspired filler, but filler nonetheless.If you're like me and check out Cage's work just to see whatever kind of ridiculous crap he's getting up to next, you'll get a sense of satisfaction out of knowing you watched what may very well be the weirdest release of his career thus far. It's weirdness without substance however so its staying power compared to his modern successes such as Color Out of Space is limited. Perhaps even being one of the more forgettable entries in his catalog overall, outside of the one or two instances where it delivers some of the most memorable Cage-isms to date.6.6/10"

I don\u2019t mind the setting, visuals, the FX or the acting, but it needed to be filmed significantly better, and have a less \u201cvideo\u201d aesthetic, for it to earn how pompous it was coming off. It\u2019s not horrible and at many times it was entertaining and different. However, it was trying way too hard to be different for the sake of being different. It has a story, but it\u2019s more stream of consciousness how it gets from place to place as the plot moves forward. There might be higher meaning in a lot of the dialogue that is spoken, but it\u2019s lost in the silly chanting and antics that are happening in every other scene. I swear it was like a cast of people try to out \u201cNicolas Cage\u201d the actual Nicolas Cage."

Its **** crazy, bonkers, trippy, dream-like, and pretty action packed. A mash up of Mad Max and everything that makes Sion Sono so great, PRISONERS OF THE GHOSTLAND definitely isn't for everyone, mainly Sono and diehard Cage fans, but its most certainly unlike anything you've seen before. It relishes in the weird and the movie is that much better for it. Easily the weirdest movie of 2021. Cage delivers another delirious performance."

You'd think after John Carpenter successfully sued the makers of the Guy Pearce starrer Lockout, that filmmakers would think twice before \"borrowing\" the main plot of Escape From New York. Guess we call it an homage. Nicolas Cage scowls and yells (before the afore mentioned bombs start ticking), and acts the middle aged tough guy. But not like Jason Statham tough guy. More like drunk uncle in a bar tough guy. Striving for style on a budget, it's more \"eh\" than anything."

      "text": "Among all the latest films Nicolas Cage has starred, Prisoners of the Ghostland doesn't appear as a rarity, even considering all the weird stuff that appears on screen in this new adventure by Sion Sono, because it really feels like a quite natural progression for his career.Sono and Cage are undoubtedly a mix worth paying attention to.Sono is eccentric, and doesn't give a damn about anything, while Cage is obviously not afraid to take on any character involved in any plot.Certainly anyone could argue that this is not necessarily something that means good cinema, but between the extremes of the common, and of those who enjoy this style of films, there's a huge gap.The quality is variable, but as long as the journey is attractive, I personally think it's worth it.Prisoners of the Ghostland is not a crazy film, nor is it a masterpiece, and it's not a movie for everyone either.Just keep it in mind if you want to see it."
