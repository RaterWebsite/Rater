It is well acted by all involved and we actually see emotional depth from Hartnett in the closing third of film, which is something audiences haven't really seen too much of from this teenie-bop actor. He surprised me by pulling his weight in a cast with several acclaimed actors (keep in mind he pulls his weight while being the lead, which has the most weight to pull in an ensemble cast), and actually showed he is capable of taking his craft somewhat seriously. Although the supporting performances are very good from all involved, this movie would simply not be the same without Hartnett's influence through his character. After all, the movie is about him, as you'll see. It's tough to talk any more about the movie without disclosing its secrets. Simply put, Slevin's plot and dialogue are a bit scatterbrained in the beginning, but stay with this movie. It will reward you at the end."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Lucky Number Slevin is a clever little crime thriller that really does a good job hooking you in and keeping you guessing. It ties everything together quite nicely and is a really, really tight film. The acting from Josh Hartnett, Morgan Freeman, Bruce Willis, Ben Kingsley, Lucy Liu, and Stanley Tucci, are all solid. Additionally, the writing is quite good for the most part. The characters and their place in this neo-noir type film are all quite clear and compelling. However, the undoing of Lucky Number Slevin is two-fold: one, exposition. Nobody needs this much exposition. Christopher Nolan would leave this film thinking, \"Wow that was a lot of exposition\". That is how much of this stuff there is. While needed, obviously, it is not needed to the level found here. Additionally, the film literally walks you through the plot at the end. Any audience is not that stupid. Here, it has to be explained to you because the film did not think you could handle it without having it spoon fed to you. Thus, this is the first time you are seeing most of it. Even worse though, this piece of the film practically undoes the characterizations of the prior 3/4ths of the film. The audience is smarter than this film wants to admit. Though I said it is two-fold, I am reminded of a few more problems that are inherent here, namely how homophobic it is. Holy cow I have not seen a film this homophobic in a while. That said, it is quite entertaining and is a well made crime thriller, both of which help elevate it (slightly) above its faults."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Pro tip: when it takes the last half-hour of your movie to explain the first 80 minutes of your movie, you're trying too hard. You see this kind of mistake in other Tarantino copycat films like \"Smokin' Aces,\" \"Suicide Kings\" and even \"The Boondock Saints\" to some extent. Screenwriters trying to not only outsmart the audience, but themselves. It really doesn't impress. You see the twists and turns coming from a mile away and when they eventually land, you lament the fact that the filmmakers still find the need to explain how we got here. There's some charm and personality on display here and there, but I couldn't help but notice the \"everyone thinks that Quentin Tarantino is the best at writing dialogue? Well, I'll show them!\" sort of aspect to it all. You'd think that Tarantino alums like Willis and Liu would get wise to the knockoffs and counterfeiting, but here we are. I do miss Josh Hartnett, though. Remember when him and Lucy Liu were big draws at the theater? Also, remember theaters?"}, {"rating": "5", "text": "'Lucky Number Slevin' is a sleek pace movie with a solid cast who all do good work. As the movie goes along, it keeps you guessing.However, I feel like the tone and style of the movie is very messy. The movie starts off bleak, but then turns quirky and funny - with characters plucked out of a Guy Ritchie movie, and dialogue from a Tarantino movie. Later towards the end it turns into a hard hitting drama.Flawed, but enjoyable."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "A View to Many Kills.\r If you're feeling depravity-deprived, if you haven't seen enough violent death in the past few weeks -- after all, it's been over a month since \"The Hills Have Eyes\" was released! -- relief is finally in sight.\r That's Paul McGuigan's \"Lucky Number Slevin,\" which despite its nonsensical title turns out to be a slaughterfest dedicated to the proposition that killing the old way is best. It still kills that old way, via pistol, over and over and over and over. It may be the bloodiest film since \"Sin City,\" and it's so bloody that eight people are graphically murdered before the star even appears.\r That star is the scrawny, cute, innocent Josh Hartnett, as one poor schlemiel called Slevin, who appears a typical twenty-something failed-to-launch slacker in baggy T-shirt and raggedy pants, wool cap pulled low over eyes and ears. Is he a punk musician or a computer nerd-genius?\r Well, actually neither: He's a guy who shows up in a buddy's New York apartment, which is the wrong place at exactly the wrong time. Suddenly two very violent gangstas arrive, beat the pep out of him and haul him before The Boss, played by the magisterial Morgan Freeman. Although Slevin protests, the boss isn't too interested in these protests and insists that he, amateur Slevin, is Nick, the actual renter of the apartment. And that since Nick owes him money, he, Slevin, must either pay it back (clearly impossible) or earn his way out of penury by performing a service. That service is a murder that is an act of retribution in the service of a larger tribal battle between The Boss and The Rabbi (Ben Kingsley).\r Before this comes the movie's bloody preamble, which seems to have nothing to do with anything. It's the story, set 20 years in the past, of a young man who tried to hustle the mob by betting on a fixed horse race. For his hubris, he was paid in death, as were his wife and child (all three extinctions clinically documented). From that story, narrated at an airport by a crippled Bruce Willis to a completely different young man, the movie then leaps into the present, where we watch this morning's extinctions, also clinically documented, of a man getting into a car in a parking lot and a bookie and his henchmen being wiped out by an unseen expert in improvised weaponry (including a baseball!). Meanwhile, back at the airport, Willis snaps the neck of the boy he's been talking to like it's a swizzle stick in a slightly used martini glass. That extinction -- in fact, all of them -- are played as punch lines to a joke that everyone but the victim gets.\r The movie has a jaunty, even merry tone for something so blood-soaked. It takes its editing rhythms from the clever Guy Ritchie of \"Snatch\" and \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\" fame (and not \"Swept Away,\" with wifey Madonna, infamy). Like Ritchie's far superior works, it plays a lot of tricks with chronology, with point of view, with concealment and revelation.\r It also bears a more than casual connection to \"Wicker Park,\" which was also directed by McGuigan and also starred Hartnett. Many of the same mechanisms are deployed, so much so that this film could be called \"Wicker Park With Berettas.\" That movie, if you are not among the seven or nine who saw it, was a contempo romance set in Chicago, where Hartnett played a young businessman who falls in love with a girl who then vanishes almost instantly, a mystery that becomes an obsession for him to solve.\r Both films are built around the same structure, which begins with a cleverly filmed scenario in which we watch this and that happen, and take for granted we understand what we've seen. But that scenario is kind of the Rosetta stone of the story, and it is returned to over and over, and with each revisit it becomes more complex. Looking at it from other vantage points, we learn that what seemed innocent and spontaneous was neither; relationships emerge, coalitions are revealed, perpetrators, barely glimpsed in the original, are identified. In \"Wicker Park\" the cleverness and the gamesmanship were fun. Here they're only almost fun.\r There's just too much death, it comes too quickly, it has no moral import, it becomes ultimately meaningless. It's not that hyper-violent movies are axiomatically a bad thing -- \"The Wild Bunch,\" \"The Godfather,\" \"The Seven Samurai,\" even \"Hamlet\" and Orson Welles's \"Macbeth\" show the foolishness of that assertion. It's just that this particular example is so laden with shootings -- rarely gunfights, I should add; mostly quick executions of unarmed people who simply keel over when popped -- that it becomes somehow tedious. The young director is intoxicated with them, but out in the audience, we're beginning to squirm. Let's see some contests, some fights, some skill: No, we're just watching an execution-o-rama.\r The saving grace is both Freeman and Kingsley are charismatic performers, each the master of a posse that reflects a specific ethnic heritage."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "At first it seems like a black comedy.

Quite frankly, I'm surprised that the critics hated it so much, rating it just a couple points higher than sequels to successful sequels made purely to be cash cows (Pirates of the Caribbean sequels anyone?) Compared to the cash cows that receive these low scores (and deservedly so), Lucky # Slevin is funny, well thought out, well paced, and interlaced with enough memorable characters to warrant seeing several times.\r I should add now that I have no interest in movie stars and never see films just because so and so actor is in it.

That didn't stop far too many hacks over the past 12 years from watching Pulp Fiction (some more than once) and chirping, \"Hey, I can do this, too!\" Even though such resultant efforts as Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead and The Last Days of Frankie the Fly should've consigned this genre to the same receptacle as the calypso movies of the late 1950s and the lambada movies of the early 1990s, Lucky Number Slevin proves that some dead things just won't stay buried. In telling the story of a luckless kid who becomes entangled in a deadly underworld Hatfield-and-McCoy feud, writer Jason Smilovic and director Paul McGuigan throw in all the expected ingredients: a tricky, flashback-heavy structure, a cast of (mostly) criminals, some bursts of violence and gore that the filmmakers think are too offbeat to be offensive, dialogue that nobody speaks in real life unless they're trying too hard to imitate Tarantino characters, and frequent instances where two or more people pause to have a conversation about some thirty-year-old Top 40 hit or TV show or action movie (in Tarantino's films, these little digressions are often major highlights; in his imitations they just grind the action down to a complete halt). In David Cronenberg's The Fly, scientist Seth Brundle teleported a steak only to find, when applying the taste test, that it wasn't a real steak, and therefore was inedible. Same here: Smilovic and McGuigan do everything that Tarantino does but are missing two essential ingredients: the heart and soul. Go back to David Carradine's self-defining speech about Superman and Clark Kent in Kill Bill Volume 2, or Sam Jackson's surprisingly moving one near the end/beginning of Pulp Fiction about how hard he's trying to be the shepherd, and you'll see that QT has very few modern equals when it comes to revealing character through dialogue. No such luck in Slevin: it's all surface and gimmicks, with obnoxiously baroque look-at-me set design that brought back childhood memories of my sister eating too many Pixy Stix and throwing them all up, a so-called \"surprise ending\" that I guessed almost from minute one (not that predictability is necessarily a fatal flaw, but having nothing else up your sleeve is), and a truly repugnant mingling of bloodshed and sentimentality. Among the large cast, only Bruce Willis and Robert Forster bring something resembling originality or energy (perhaps because they've worked with Tarantino in the past and know the drill)...but this is the first time that the great Morgan Freeman has ever slummed, and as for Ben Kingsley as his rival, \"The Rabbi\", his accent brought none-too-welcome memories of Laurence Olivier's \"I hef no son!\" bit in Neil Diamond's version of The Jazz Singer. (Is the reason he insisted on billing himself as \"Sir Ben\" here that, after doing this and the Uwe Boll vampire movie Bloodrayne in the same year, he felt the need to overcompensate?) And why does Josh Hartnett continue to get steady work, anyway? Inoffensive at best in ensemble movies like Black Hawk Down, Pearl Harbor and Sin City where the special effects and action sequences are the real stars, when he's given leads in things like 40 Days and 40 Nights or Hollywood Homicide or McGuigan's Wicker Park, Hartnett displays terminal blandness of a sort that hasn't been seen or heard onscreen since the last straight-to-video release starring \"the two Coreys\" hit the cutout bin. In all fairness and with due respect, I DO have close friends who DID enjoy this movie (largely because they didn't guess the ending), so in the interest of equal time let me present the op-ed view: Lucky Number Slevin is every bit as clever, witty and well-conceived as its title."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "A truly awful movie with no redeeming value which does nothing but glorify violence and sadism.

Lastly the acting was as wooden as a forest, all round. Read a paper for intellect, not watch this!"}, {"rating": "5", "text": "It wasn't too bad, but I was bored at times.

We open a range of ways in this film, with various characters being thrown at us from the beginning, and dialogue perhaps too elegant to fit the plot, but certainly something thought-provoking.\rWe eventually run into Slevin (Hartnett) who is occupying his friends apartment, but is then accused of being said friend, who owes a lot of money to The Boss (Freeman) and The Rabbi (Kingsley), two rival gangsters, who live literally across the road from each other in two identical towers, but a past altercation leaves them almost fearful of the other.\rSmith (Willis) is a master assassin who seems to be whispering in the ear of both gangsters, with the overall goal of keeping the right people quiet. Lucy Liu plays Nick's neighbour Lindsey, who grows increasingly unsure of Slevins role in everything. A  big cast like this does indeed lead to some underlying problems. perhaps the pacing of the story.\rThe plot moves at a very erratic and sometimes confusing motion. Certain cuts and extras seem unnecessary and I was baffled as to why they were in fact there.  At times it is very easy to question the relevance of the whole thing, simply because at times the backdrop is used for a comic effect rather than focusing on what could have been a straightforward and engaging story had it been done a different way. The realisation of Slevin was a nice twist, but only eventually, as director Peter McGuigan took too long to follow up his major twist with the ultimate one.\rLucky Number Slevin is still an enjoyable piece, the acting is excellent from the heavy-hitting cast, all delivering memorable performances and engaging characters, and the story itself, stripping away the visuals and deliberate confusion, is in fact quite good as the climax creeps up.\rThe idea of creating visual standouts just seemed unnecessary, but the acting and decent plot of the film did save it from going too far down."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Loved the plot, The clever dialogue that was made even better by the stellar cast attached to it.
