I enjoyed the English humor and there were politically incorrect moments that may not have made it into an American film that I appreciated (such as getting someone inebriated on purpose).

The kids in the audience who'd gone for a bathroom-filling bear had clearly had an absolute blast, the elderly members who'd gone for nostalgia purposes were left with big smiles on their faces, and those in between were chattering away about their favourite bit.\r It's a really nice film with much slapstick humour (as seen in the trailer) but has the heart one would expect from a producer of the Harry Potter movies. There were moments when tears were shed (particularly on a windswept rooftop) and eruptions of laughter with Paddington's escapades and Julie Walters particularly stealing their scenes.\r There are a handful of moments that don't quite fit: Nicole Kidman's villain is a bit one note (although she's clearly having a ball playing the part) and Peter Capaldi (side note: fantastic Twelfth Doctor in Doctor Who) as a slimy neighbour doesn't fit seamlessly into the plot, but otherwise it's a joyous film and well worth seeing."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Paddington is a very hard movie not to like.

Lucky for him, the Brown family discovers him and offers a temporary haven. But he also catches the eye of a museum taxidermist, who is determined to add the rare bear to his collection.\r The first teaser trailer for this movie was in my opinion god-awful, you know when he's in the bathroom and he puts the two tooth brushes in his ears and gives it a little bit of a twist and turn, then he pulls it out and you can clearly see a giant peace of ear wax and then he licks it; that right they is just stupid kids humor and I wasn't looking forward to film at all.\r But when I look at some of the reviews for the film it actually got good feed back from critics. Empire give the film a five out of five star's and IGN give the film a 7.9/10, I couldn't believe it, I had to check twice to make sure that what I'm seeing is true, but I still wasn't hooked until I got a chance to see the film and to my surprise the movie isn't as bad as I thought it was and I actually found the movie to be funny.\r Ben Whishaw did the voice for the marmalade loving bear himself Paddington, and Ben Whishaw did a outstanding job of playing Paddington. He had that voice of a young, friendly and kind person (or bear if you must). Now originally Colin Firth was suppose to play this role but at the last minute he turned the role down by saying, \"The voice didn't match the character \", and to be honest I think he did the right thing, because I don't Firth's voice will match the character at all he just sound like Colin Firth.\r The movie has beautiful cinematography with some breathtaking shots of London, and the film had the Christmas feeling to it and it actually got the tone right.\r Now the visual effect's for the bear I have to be honest was the most realistic thing I've seen since this years movie Dawn Of the planet of the Apes. His fur looks like real fur that I can just go up to the screen a feel it, then I get kicked out the cinema for being a weirdo, but as I said realistic.\r If I had to pick a thing that I didn't like about the film I would say the character's and some of the jokes sometimes hit and sometimes miss. The character's in the movie are not all that interesting and they pretty dull to watch, Paddington, Nicole Kidman and Peter Capaldi are the only character's that I actually liked, and yes even the villain I enjoyed watching more then the family. Some of the jokes at times mash really well and didn't but when I think that's a small complain.\r Overall Paddinton was the biggest surprise of the year for me with it's cute bear, nice story and overall a good family film."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I have never read the books or seen a single episode of the TV show.

Therefore, it is with genuine sorrow that I have to acknowledge the fact that the whole does not equal the sum of its sometimes very inspired parts. The main problem is with the story itself which just doesn't cut it when compared to some amazing scenes of slapstick timed to absolute perfection.\r Paddington himself is wonderfully realised and uncannily voiced by Ben Whishaw. Let's face it, it's the bear we have come to see and he doesn't disappoint. Scene after scene ignites. The bathroom and cello tape sequences in particular are great fun. Also, there are magical moments involving a dolls house and a miniature railway carriage. In fact, there is so much to enjoy that it is rather a shame that the linking narrative and Paddington's human counterparts start to drag the film down.

And I have to say, I most certainly believe it now. \"Paddington\" has a charm to it that's lacking in a lot of live-action/CGI hybrid films today: instead of focusing on the typical toilet humor and \"dumb\" jokes, this film is actually witty, clever, and wonderfully-written, and unlike a lot of similar films, it's one of those films where you actually care about the characters because they're so well-developed. The film is also beautifully shot and wonderfully inventive with its visual effects, and even if there are a few crazy moments in the plot, the film has too much irresistible charm to make up for it.

At once they become friends.\rMany years later the bears' nephew launches upon a journey to London (because his uncle dies and his aunt is going to home of elderly bears) in a quest to find the adventurer. The little bear gets lost on the Paddington station (That is why later he was given the name Paddington), but a nice-looking family picks him up and helps him in his mission. Turns out, that the adventurer had been expelled from the geographical community when he  returned from the jungle because he did not bring any trofeys from his journey (like stuffed bears) and that his daughter is now on a quest to correct her father's mistake by killing the little bear. Of course, the good prevails in the end.\r I personally enjoyed the plot though. It is thought-through and is suprisingly original for such cartoons.\r I would really recommend you to watch it with your kid, for all the kids around us were amazed.

I didn't. CGI/live-action crossovers have never struck me as a technique that could ever lead to anything other than cringing from adults and mindless amusement from the kiddies. Well, here we are. I didn't think the day would come so soon, trust me. I've been yearning for a long time to stumble across a savory family film, but the consideration of Paddington as that diamond in the rough had never even crossed my mind. I'm here to report the good news - Paddington rules. It's not just a good movie, but one that even verges on greatness in instances and I'm convinced if it had found the right audience and not been released in the garbage heap of a month that is January, Paddington could've found itself approaching instant-classic status.\r Now let's take a step back. This is still just a family film. This isn't a revelatory movie for the genre. It doesn't subvert cliches. It doesn't break new ground. Paddington, rather, succeeds because it casts aside what has become prevalently detrimental in a recent slew of family films (mean-spirited cynicism, degraded intelligence) and embraces theage-old virtues of naivety and warm-heartedness that make the genre so appealing. Paddington is not a movie that succumbs to referring to zeitgeist topics of cultural relevance. It sticks to what is true to the original content of the books and, though it is visually resplendent thanks to advances in technology, is rendered somewhat timeless.\r The modern aesthetic I mentioned earlier is a seamlessly blended interaction of the titular computer generated bear and the game cast of VERY English actors. When I say that I BEARLY noticed that Paddington was CGI (obvious, grating pun obviously intended), I mean it. The illusion never broke, everything felt authentic, a compliment I can only bestow to a few applications of the hybrid medium (Life of Pi, LOTR, the new Planet of the Apes films). And boy, is this bear a delight.\r Ben Whishaw voices Paddington with a gentle, graceful, mannerly demeanor that never breaks or betrays itself by succumbing to negativity. He is a compassionate, warm children's icon I can believe in. The ensemble of performers he is surrounded by is uniformly great as well, with Sally Hawkins exuding her typically optimistic effervescence and Hugh Bonneville's stuffy disposition deconstructing into the butt of many jokes. The child performances are devoid of irritation, another welcome pair of performances in the mix. Even Nicole Kidman, whom I would have expected to buckle to cartoonish villainy, avoids outright juvenile gags, save for an attack perpetrated by pigeons in the final act. The only performance issue I draw in Paddington is in the form of Jim Broadbent, whose antics are bumbling and infantile to the degree of mild irritation, though not embarrassment.\r Humor abounds at every turn. A silly gag here, an unexpected misdirect there, all for the sake of inconsistent absurdity. Not everything works, as they rarely do in any comedy, but Paddington's hit-to-miss ratio is high, and it's all accented with a quirk I hadn't anticipated. Some off-kilter camerawork and the spontaneous insertion of a subversively articulate vernacular make it feel like the kids film Wes Anderson never made (oh wait, Fantastic Mr. Fox anyone?). These oddball stylistic flourishes Paddington employs avoid stagnancy. While some of the jokes feel obvious, there are also those that also catch me off guard. There is actual wit on display.\r Paddington is a movie about an anthropomorphic bear from Peru with a deep appetite for marmalade and an emergency sandwich at the ready underneath his hat. It's a silly one, this flick. Amidst it's slapstick and hilarity, however, there is depth and real emotion. Paddington deserves laudatory sentiments decreeing it one of the best family films in recent memory because it is, plain and simple. Buy this one for your kids and keep it as one of the formative films of their childhood, it deserves that much."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "\"Paddington\" was a very good and funny movie.
