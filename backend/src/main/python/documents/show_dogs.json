      "text": "A bafflingly unfunny, unimaginative, and uninspired effort on the part of pretty much everyone involved, Raja Gosnell's \"Show Dogs\" is not only just an immeasurably sub-par effort in every regard, it's also occasionally offensive in some of its attempts at thematics and its general belief in the stupidity of the people watching it. I challenge anybody to defend this as anything other than a poorly made, disgracefully ideated, and horrifically produced misfire of an attempt at cashing in on a fad that died back in the early 2000's. Simply one of the worst."

Seriously, once you see that Raja Gosnell is the director of this, you better fear for your life.I would have given this a 0 had it not been that Will Arnett is actually trying to make his performance good."

      "text": "Bland and unoriginal in so many different ways, Show Dogs is a prime example of a movie that is near the level of a high-quality direct-to-video movie that feature talking dogs and trust me when I say that because there are a lot of talking dog movies that should have just ended up being direct-to-video and this is sadly one of them. Show Dogs is also another prime example of what to not do to make your movie successful. Don't fill them up with clich\u00e9s because everyone knows they'll get sick and tired of them before the movie could ever end."

      "text": "Easily the worst film of 2018 by a long shot. How did Eagle Pictures get away with releasing this movie? It is beyond cringily unfunny. With the amount of fart jokes in this movie, you would think at least ONE of them would be funny. The reality is that not even one of the fart jokes are humorous. Also, the CGI is just bad, and some of the CGI effects make the dogs look more at home in an HP Lovecraft or Stephen King novel than in a kids movie. On that note, \"frightening\" would be a good descriptor for Show Dogs!"

Even as a children's movie it is god awful. The fart jokes are extremely common and bad. If it makes you feel better my three year old nephew thought it was 'okay, but kinda boring'. A true professional reviewer, in my opinion."
