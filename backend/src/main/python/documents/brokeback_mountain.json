      "text": "Brokeback Mountain is one of the biggest classics of the 00\u00b4s decade. And Lee is a great director not afraid of doing such different films, and with this one, he is at his best. The pace is perfect to make you feel the loneliness people in the Mid West around the 60\u00b4s-70\u00b4s used to feel, and especially the characters here presented. Once the film ends, you can\u00b4t get out of your head this impactful movie. Cinematography is crazy good. And the acting... so real, perfect and raw. Jake Gyllenhaal does a great job, Anne Hathaway is great in her little role, Michelle Williams is all kinds of outstanding... but Heath Ledger... a performance that defines a career. I would have given the oscar to him that year. Incredible what he did with his character. I give the movie a 10 because there\u00b4s no flaw one can find. Crash winning over Brokeback and Munich was the biggest joke in the Academy\u00b4s history. At least it got 3 including best director."

You get so caught up in the movie......and what is going on. When it was over, we were both so down. Actually down for a couple of days. This is the first movie that has ever had this kind of impact on me. She and I have had some of the best talks since this movie and it has brought us closer.

For the obvious Christians who slammed the movie because of its content (yes, I am a straight male Christian with a family), this movie offered great insight into those who are different than most of us and how those people are affected by the intolerence of the rest of us.  Before you praise Christians so much remember...the guys at the end who murdered Jack probably called themselves Christians.\r Good insightful movie.  If you keep an open mind you'll learn.  If you don't keep an open mind, don't bother seeing it and go see Hostel (you won't have a problem with that movie)."

I consider it a well written and well acted movie. \r\rThe movie is a sad one because the love of the main characters is forbidden and takes place outside their marriages. I would consider this a call to acceptance. If their relationship was accepted there would be no infidelity. As for the \"hate crime scene\" at the end... do you really think that life treats everyone fair. \r\rI would call this movie a fair depiction of LIFE. Not every stroy end \"happily ever after.\""

But amidst the grand beauty of Brokeback Mountain, the two men fall in love with one another. But when the job is done, they're forced to walk their separate ways. Ennis' father taught him to condemn homosexuality when he was a child, and so he began to condemn his own feelings. Both men are forced to deny the only passion either of them will ever feel. They pretend so as to fit in with the others. And in doing so they hurt themselves and carry great pain with each passing moment. Both Ennis and Jack marry and have children. But every once in while, they'd get to meet up on Brokeback Mountain where they can finally stop pretending and expose there vulnerability. This is where their hearts truly lie. Brokeback Mountain is powerful, beautiful and poetic. It hits you right on your chest like a bullet when you least expect it and steals away your heart. The cinematography is gorgeous, the score is elegant and all performances, particularly Ledger's as the restrained and distant Ennis Del Mar, are marvellous. This is Ang Lee's masterpiece. Brokeback Mountain was the best film of 2005 and the greatest / most important love story of this century."

      "text": "This film addresses a homosexual affair between two cowboys. Although the press and the gay-friendly publicity tried to sell the idea that it was a true homosexual romance, I was not convinced. Watching the film, I found that the script suggests something different: two lonely men whose unfulfilled emotional needs lead to a homosexual affair, despite their marriages and individual commitments. There is no love in this. The film is essentially about doubts, unfulfilled emotions, moral and emotional conflicts, the breaking of taboos and the consequences that it has afterwards, in the life of the one who did it. In any case, it is undeniably one of the most remarkable films of Heath Ledger's career. The actor deserves applause for his work in this film, where he dominated and stole the limelight from his own colleague Jake Gyllenhaal. This actor, for his part, has always been much more obliterated and the way he interpreted was not so interesting or consistent. Ang Lee did a decent job, but he seemed to be particularly focused on giving the film a good scenery and cinematography, with great success in that. Even so, the result of his work was a lukewarm, slow-paced film, and that makes it annoying, cutting off the connection between the audience and what they're watching."

Aside from being beautifully directed, with great technical aspects, as well as great acting, this is one of the most beautiful scripts of the 21st century so far. It didn't surprise me when I found out Annie Proulx was a finalist for a Pulitzer for the short story, which is translated very well by the two screen writers. The movie starts out very innocent and sweet, and then it starts to turn into a gradual downward spiral of devastation until you're just left emotional knocked out by the end of the movie. The themes of society's influence on human behavior, the desire for happiness, and demise caused by obsession, are all subtly, yet powerfully, conveyed in this movie. Calling this a gay love story is like calling Lord Of The Rings a movie about hiking. This is one of the most torturous, psychological portrayals of two people's lives I've ever seen in a movie. It's so well calculated, without coming off the least bit unnatural. I've seen it several times, and I still pick up on things that I hadn't caught onto before. I heard it was a groundbreaking movie about a gay romance, and I didn't get how that was, since there had been many movies about gay romances before. I figured it was probably an overrated movie. When I saw it, I realized I couldn't have been more wrong. Your emotional connection will be irrelevant to your sexual orientation. What is really going to connect you to the movie are your ideas about the pressure to conform to society, compared to your desire to live a life of happiness. One man chooses conformity, and the other chooses happiness, and it doesn't necessarily end up how you might expect. I'm actually getting emotional writing this, thinking about the movie. I really hope everyone who watches it is able to pick up on the subtle themes, the hidden meanings behind specific lines, and the inner thoughts of particular characters who might not be ready to say those thoughts out loud, or even admit them to themselves. Those kind of things are extremely difficult to incorporate into a script without losing its realistic feel, but this movie does it. Of course, it might take a few views to pick up on everything. Whether you're judging this movie on its intelligent, calculated writing, its technical achievements, its performances, of which Heath Ledger's is one of the best of the 21st century, or its overall directing, or if you judge a movie on its emotional appeal, and its powerful, thought provoking themes, I can't see how you objectively give this movie anything less than a strong review."

I did feel a smidge sad when Heath found his shirt (though I saw it coming when the shirt went missing in reel 2), but mostly I felt that these two dudes were too mopey and existential to be real gay cowboys. I mean, unless I missed something, they're not supposed to be French, are they? They behaved like starry-eyed teenagers past the point (and age) of believability; as much as I could buy the first half hour of meet-cute and the last five minutes of human loss, the big fat middle was a dull TV message-movie. Did Matthew Shepherd really die for this? And brand me a stereo-typer, but (in my limited experience) of most of the gay couples I've met, at least one of the partners displays way more of a fey affect then either of these two stoic shepherds ever showed."

En tout cas, le film atteint ses objectifs en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9fense de la communaut\u00e9 LBGT ou LGBT (je ne sais jamais dans quel sens \u00e7a se met) avec ses allusions (pas trop appuy\u00e9es cela dit) sur l'intol\u00e9rance et l'homophobie.Il faut dire qu'au Wyoming ou au Texas, les cow-boys avec leurs chapeaux n'aiment visiblement pas faire des heures supp' dans les usines \u00e0 Suchards ou du moins pas tous, voire tr\u00e8s peu en fait \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque du film qui se passe dans les ann\u00e9es 60 et apr\u00e8s. Pour \u00e7a, il aurait fallu \u00e9migrer \u00e0 Frisco mes mignons !Heureusement, il n'y a rien de trop frontal et en v\u00e9rit\u00e9, tout se passe comme dans un couple h\u00e9t\u00e9ro sauf qu'ils trompent leurs bonnes femmes respectives avec le copain cow-boy... d'ailleurs, la tronche quand l'une d'elles l'apprend -gazon maudit \u00e0 l'envers- \u00e7a vaut son pesant de haricots en bo\u00eete ! Car nos homos ont femmes, enfants et bagages et en apparence une vie tout-\u00e0-fait normale...Ce serait en fait presque int\u00e9ressant, ou au moins dr\u00f4le, si le film d'Ang Lee n'\u00e9tait pas aussi mou du genou et endormi parce qu'on se fait chier plus mortellement que dans un \u00e9pisode de Plus belle la vie. Les deux acteurs font ce qu'ils peuvent mais ont toujours l'air un peu ridicule quand ils... (ah non pas la rime) se voient. On y croit pas et on s'emmerde \u00e0 fond...Il aurait fallu en faire une com\u00e9die, j'avais d\u00e9j\u00e0 une id\u00e9e de titre en t\u00eate (la turbine maudite par exemple) parce que l\u00e0 on s'en branle de tout \u00e7a en fait."

      "text": "Ang Lee's story on two gay loving cowboys is just a complete waste of my time. I never thought that after lee's blockbuster bust, \"Hulk\"  that he would create something completely worse. Sadly he does. First off, the story is just ridiculous. A lot of the movie is just sex, which had plenty of scenes that i've never want to see ever again. The acting may be decent, but when you put these characters in a story like this, it just doesn't work. Plain and Simple. Honestly, I think Lee can do much better than this crap. He somewhat did that with \"Life of Pi\", but I'm still waiting for that one movie of his that'll hopefully redeem him as one of the greatest directors of our time. But right now, this what we're stuck with. Overall, this movie is a terrible storyline to go off of."

      "text": "My girlfriend dragged me out to see this: A movie about two male farmers that fall in love but hardly say anything  to each other throughout the whole movie, all while pretending to be straight even having female wives. An overrated movie, my girlfriend even apologized to me for taking me to see it because she didn't like it either since the gay couple hardly ever said anything to each other. It's an okay drama that also shows the dangers and hostile perceptions gay men experience in society, worth watching once, but doesn't live up to the hype. 6/10 for a mediocre movie."
