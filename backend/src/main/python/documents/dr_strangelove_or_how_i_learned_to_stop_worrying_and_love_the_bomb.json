I, however, found the movie to be the greatest comedy I have ever seen, easily surpassing other critically-aclaimed works of other genres (cough... the Godfather). It makes a statement about the workings of our government which is as true now as it was in their time. (Truer? Bush.) The wit is still sharp, and the movie feels much less lethargic than other slow-moving classics (cough... the Godfather). You must see it."

The acting was above par and There is no other movie out there that takes itself so serious but not so serious at the same time, there is a lot of comedic values in here strung over a very serious plot, It's hard to tell exactly what it is. This movie will have you in awe one second and you will laugh the next. I have never seen anything like it and I doubt I ever will again. One of my favorite movies of all time."

A lone general gone mad gives the green light launching an A-Bomb attack on Russia, and the President now (Sellers) must pull out all the stops to prevent this. This dark comedy is shot entirely in black and white with terrific production design. Astutely, Kubrick focuses on the actual nuclear event in itself, thus removing the issues of foreign politics. The films message simply put its this; man is not at the mercey of machines,but it in fact it's just the opposite. Petter Sellers is sensational playing several roles and the film has stood the test of time remaining undated."

After watching it, you begin to regret that after this film Kubrick went to make films on serious topics. Beautiful adaptation of the Cold War. A great comedy that makes fun of the meaninglessness of the confrontation of 2 superpowers. The film was shot more than 50 years ago, and is still relevant."

The first time I didn't even notice. For the third day I have been watching a movie non-stop. He's perfect. Dr. Strangelove is the best character. \"Mein F\u00fchrer, I can walk!\" One of my favorite films. David Lynch's hair dandruff madness. I would say 1/4 of that episode of the third season of Twin Peaks, where all the timing was showing special effects. But quite insane. Stanley Kubrick is a genius. He is a genius. Genius. I'm telling you. Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin President of the Russian Federation. I'm a dirty communist. I drink vodka, We communists don't drink water.

But this works well as it conveys what the film is about, the lunacy of politicians and the effects of beaurocracy. Dr Strangelove himself only appears in the latter half of the film but god does Peter Sellers do a good job! In all 3 of his roles. It's a pity everyone knows the ending though because it's been done to death in popular culture (Along with the famous line \"Mein Fuhrer! I can walk!\" one of the funniest in history. However I will say the 5 minutes before the famous segment with major Kong is i think one of the best 5 minutes in cinematic history, especially with the countdown, of sorts. It is truly one of the most tense few minutes I've ever seen and the acting is brilliant! The look on their faces as they approach the target in almost too real. It deserves all of the praise it gets without doubt! Peter Sellers, you are one of the greats! Along of course with Kubrick"

Here's the thing, the movie looks great on a technical level, Peter Sellars and George C. Scott are great in the movie, some of the war scenes looked really amazing, and it's funny at parts. However, I wasn't interested the rest of the characters aside from Sellars multiple performances and Scott's performance. I wasn't that too invested in the story until about halfway through. And there were parts that I simply did not laugh at. The movie, to me, only felt like it was suppose to be a comedy at parts. The rest felt to me that it was suppose to be drama. I guess the structure didn't feel like a true comedy to me. But like I said, the second half is what ultimately drew me into the story. I know lots of people love this political comedy, but personally it didn't work to its full benefit like I hoped it would. Overall, even with its lack in structure, the movie slowly builds to become more engaging the further you get into it even if it feels too late. I'll give \"Dr. Strangelove\" a B-!"

In the end, I simply can't betray my desire to praise this film, even if it means I'm a pretentious genius.

The movie shines because of it's authenticity and the great and versatile acting by Peter Sellers. The movies name is a character in the movie obviously but he doesn't come into the picture until about an hour in. Dr. Strangelove is a extremely smart person but at the same time a nutter. He is from germany and mistakenly calls the president \" Mein Fuhrer\" a couple of times and his hand would start shooting up making the nazi hand gesture or signal if you will. Which did show the brilliant comedic virtues of Stanley Kubrick. Another fabulous adaptation from a novel."

I used to show the scene where Peter Sellers is captured to my troops, to show them how Americans are perceived, and I use quotes like -- \"I don't think it's fair to condemn an entire program because of a single slip up.\" -- in business all the time. So, the delicious script, the fantastic camera work and lighting and the terrific characterizations make this a winner Boys, the world was a different place then; you have to slip into the millieu."

      "text": "Without a doubt *the* greatest satiric screenplay of the 20th Century, only less dark than the far more disturbing and blacker comedy of Silence of the Lambs. To understand Dr. Strangelove you have to understand a Cold War era when the likelihood of nuclear holocaust seemed imminent and anti-Communist paranoia was still running very high. You think Sarah Palin is bad? The script savagely lampoons the real post-McCarthy wing-nuttery of the age, from anti-fluoridation reactionary groups like the John Birch Society to real nuclear war advocates speaking flippantly of maximum body counts during a full-scale nuclear war. The script roasts them all and takes a good wide swing at a few other soft spots in American society -- the use of Nazi scientists (we got to the moon on the shoulders of non other than Verner von Braun's leadership), the anti-commie paranoia that bordered on psychosis (the McCarthy era was pretty bad), the euphemistic \"Peace is Our Profession\" whitewash of the DOD (which led us to millions of deaths in S.E. Asia) and so on. Strangelove takes it to the logical extreme in a sarcastic - even jugular - vein, demonstrating the inanity of anti-fluoridation paranoia via a psychotic general admitting his withholding ejaculation in defense of his precious bodily fluids. This is examined in relation to fluoridation and the various epigrammatic phrases peace on earth, preserve our essences and purity of essence also revealing to us the acronymic three-letter cipher prefix necessary to cancel the attack."

Its incandescent black comedy is unsurpassed. No aspect of the film deserves less that a 10 rating: casting, acting, directing, staging, cinematography, editing, script -- all are virtually perfect. Kubrick's unflinching finale should shame many of today's film makers and cause the viewer to wonder what the appropriate response is: hopeless laughter or abject tears.
