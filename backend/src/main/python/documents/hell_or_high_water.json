The three lead actors blew me away.  Ben Foster always brings it, but he delivers a level of nuance I was even surprised by. Chris Pine finally gets a chance to demonstrate his real acting chops - he's been wasting his time in too many Star Trek flicks.  And The Dude?  Jeff Bridges?  This might be his career-defining performance. Beyond the bravura acting performances, the film just has an easy, authentic feel to it. You can almost smell West Texas. It's a beautifully shot work. Won't spoil the plot - just go see this film. It's the antidote to what's been ailing Hollywood for the last couple of years.

A movie that is so simple in its execution, yet so layered and tense at the same time. Hell or High Water is a movie that is almost completely dependent on the cast and the chemistry between them. This movie has a cast of four living characters and two characters that are as important, even though they have no lines in the movie.\r On the surface, it seems like a simple heist/hunt movie, but the movie is actually a study of friendship, brotherhood, neighbors, and the city and state coming together. Movie is set in two states, states of Texas and Oklahoma. Both of those states were portrayed so perfectly in the movie, that they became a fifth character. The ambient in the movie is so well portrayed that one could simply get lost in the beauty of the two states by itself. Music and the support cast, that lives in this environment, are as important as the main cast, to if you haven't noticed I haven't gotten to yet. Reason for that was, I wanted to explain, that everything in this movie is so interconnected, it is so difficult to focus on the just main characters.\r Now that I have set the premise for this review lets talk about the main driving force of this picture.\r THE CAST\r The main cast of this movie entails of  : Jeff Bridges,  Gil Birmingham as the Texas Rangers and Chris Pine and Ben Foster as the bank robbers. The main thing to say in this review is to say, it is really hard to establish exactly who stole the show in this movie. The entire cast had such fantastic chemistry on the screen.\r Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham's scenes portray that these are the people that knew each other seemingly their entire lives. The friendly jabs toward each other, they way they deal with situations, everything is portrayed so smooth, you forget these are the actors, especially since they truly show you how different their characters are, and how they would  approach certain things. It is still early talk about Oscar Nominations, but everyone in this movie at least deserves up most consideration, especially Jeff Bridges.\r On the other hand we have the brothers.\r Ben Foster and Chris Pine. Without spoiling any of the movie, but just to establish my point here, the movie right away focuses on these characters, and their chemistry, their reasoning and their genuine love for each other. For any doubters out there that Chris Pine cannot act, those fears are completely unfounded here, as I would say he brings the possibly career changing role in this movie. Ben Foster is equally brilliant in the role, and as I have mentioned and I keep bringing this point home, as it is well deserved, the movie ultimately works because of the chemistry between the characters.\r This type of movie, its an experience, it is not everyone's cup of tea, its not super action packed with ongoing explosions, no superheroes or tornadoes or aliens, or natural disasters. It's a classic movie, that I mentioned before they don't make anymore. Actually, I should rephrase that, that mainstream studios don't make anymore.  And I am going to do something that's going to pull some hate, but this movie I would declare BONNIE AND CLYDE for the 21st century. It is just that good.\r 4 out of 4 stars."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Excellent acting, edgy humor, careful direction, intense interlocking narratives - it's really hard to find fault in this marvelously modern western that has all the makings of an American classic."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "My vote for best movie of 2016 to date. Superb script; the parallels between the two sets of \"brothers\" works really well, and all of the actors are at their top of their game. I probably could have done with one or two fewer \"foreclosing now\" signs alongside the roadway, but that's a very minor quibble, and shouldn't take away from the use of dusty, desolate West Texas as its own character in the movie. Great soundtrack by Nick Cave & Warren Ellis as well."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Solid modern western. Cool soundtrack and an all around entertaining film.

Feels like a modern western kind, because of where this story takes place, I mean Texas. There's no digital world like phones, computers et cetera, just an old fashioned storytelling. This is the story of two brothers and their series of bank robbery job. They are doing it for a reason, but on the other end, two cops make their effort to find who they are and nab them red handed. So when they meet, that's where the story gets to its end part.It has a strong opening, then slows down. Actually, it was approached like a classic crime film, which mean no high-tech. The story was a one liner, but the events in that story were extended. A simple screenplay, yet very effective presented on the screen. Of course the story ends with this film, but feels like there's more. It is very unlikely, though I'm thinking of a sequel.The people will remember this film for Ben Foster and Chris Pine. One of the best duo on the screen. Easily one of the best films of the year, but just it is a different theme and genre. I watched it not knowing the meaning of the title, and then I googled it. It is nothing like a must see, but I believe that you might regret if you miss it or delay your watch. So I suggest you make a right choice.8/10"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "More a character study than action film, Hell or High Water is not your classic Western.   Set in current day rural west Texas, the movie paints a bleak landscape of small towns with vacant store fronts and ranch lands dotted with For Sale signs.  Average citizens struggle to make ends meet, and not a single character in the movie has a future to look forward to. Their lives twist slowly in the wind, and the slow pace of director David Mackensie\u2019s movie left me feeling much the same way. The economic disparity between the Haves (banks and the oil companies) and the Have Nots has become so burdensome that Toby (Chris Pine) and his ex-convict brother Tanner (Ben Foster) have nothing to left lose by going desperado.  Jeff Bridges plays a deft and skillful sheriff on the verge of a retirement that he\u2019s not looking forward to.  He jokes to his partner about going out in a blaze of glory.  His fatal flaw is a lack of cultural sensitivity which, when combined with an unalterable sense of right and wrong, make it impossible for him to comprehend the cultural and moral schism that is occurring.   The story embodies the kind of social injustice message that Hollywood loves.  Yet, this movie can\u2019t be dismissed so easily.  The message is delivered with more subtleness than blunt force, and the ending is not what you would expect. The acting is solid on all fronts, and there are some guilty pleasures to be had in watching the vigilantes take in on the chin.  Plus, you can psychoanalyze your female friends by asking them if they would do what the waitress did."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Not much I can say except this is one of the best crafted movies I've seen in years.  Bridges is perfectly cast and offers perfect acting.  Every character is excellently done."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Hell or High Water is yet another limited release gem that shows that in today\u2019s film climate, independent film is the quality standard bearer. While tentpole films are fun to see because they are events, films like Hell or High Water harken back to when filmmakers were more concerned with telling interesting stories, instead of making easy money. Hell or High Water is engrossing, tells its story with depth and smarts, and features really well-rounded characters. This film is truly a great film in almost all aspects, and will likely get a ton of recognition during oscar season.\rFrom the opening scene of this film, the film is gripping, using both intrigue and acting to its advantage.    Much like many other great films, this film begins with a bang and holds the audience\u2019s attention throughout. Chris Pine has proven that he\u2019s a talented actor over the years, but this film is a major step up for him, that being said the show stealers are Ben Foster and Jeff Bridges. Foster has had amazing performances in the past, but this stands as one of his best, and Bridges plays a role that fits him like a glove, and he does it perfectly.\rThe actors are notably great, but the film is gripping because the story it tells is interesting. The story doesn\u2019t feel like a rip off of other films, and even more impressively tells it\u2019s story with depth and smarts. Nothing in this film feels like it\u2019s unrealistic or bombastic, every action in the film is well thought out and makes sense, that being said the film has a decent level of emotional depth. The impressive thing about Hell or High Water is that it\u2019s not overly sentimental, but it\u2019s the kind of film that still evokes an emotional response.\rPerhaps the biggest reason that the story is interesting, and emotionally gripping is because the characters are so well developed. From the onset all characters come from relatable places, and have plenty of layers. Above that the characters are funny and at some point they simply begin to feel like real people just being captured on film. That being said every character\u2019s conflict hits even harder, because the characters feel so relatable.\rFinding something wrong with this film is extremely hard, and in a day and age with so many films coming out in conjunction that\u2019s rare. Hell or High Water is well acted, gripping, funny, features great characters, shows an impressive amount of emotional depth, and never needlessly substitutes action for smarts. It seems safe to say that this film will get a lot of attention during Oscar season, especially for it\u2019s screenplay. If you\u2019re a fan of westerns, heist films, thrillers, or just in general like great films this film is a good choice."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Hell or High Water is definitely the best film of the summer and will be in the top three films of the year. This film immediately introduces two brothers, who create such a brilliant on screen chemistry, that it guiltily forces you to almost root for these characters, despite the crimes they are committing, which at first almost brands them as general criminals who have the urge to rob and go with the excitement of a heist \u2013 but as the story progresses in its brilliant pace, they\u2019re fleshed out as humane, definitely selfless, and with one of the brothers, regrettable in their actions. Though this film succeeds in its full-bodied character development and emotion resonance with the film following the brothers, its Jeff Bridges and his partner who really add that special extra something. The sense that this may be his final police job due to his many years on the job, and the fact he\u2019s physically weaker than he used to be, could of shifted the genre of the film into a more serious drama, however, a great amount of humour is used between Bridges and his partner \u2013 and is done so well that it comes off very unique, and adds the understanding that there is really no villains in this film, and so when the film dramatises involving the main characters, it\u2019s unlike any action scene in other modern movies, because you don\u2019t wish to see any of the characters hurt in anyway. Also, this film carries Texas once again onto the silver screen in great fashion, this film is a brilliant display of the culture in the state, so with all those reasons, despite the rating saying it\u2019s an 8/10, this film gets from me, an 8.5/10 - 88%"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Exceptionally thought provoking slice of life story with beautiful scenery and a sense of old time movie feel - with longer cuts allowing time to get absorbed and involved with the characters.

That is, until a Texas ranger Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) and his partner Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham) are onto them and try their best to track both these brothers down before they hit another branch.\r This film contains some great acting from the main cast, Bridges is fantastic as the ambitious Texas ranger, so caught up in the moment of trying to catch the two menacing brothers, that he essentially has an ego for wanting to catch them. Foster is so dastardly unlikable as the always acting-before-thinking Tanner, and Pine is marvelous as Toby, who is obviously inexperienced as opposed to his ex-con older brother.\r Director David Mackenzie should be sure of getting a \"Best Director\" nomination of crafting this intense and sometimes shocking drama, the cinematography by Giles Nuttgens should also be considered for an Oscar nomination. Bridges may also get a \"Best Supporting Actor\" nomination for his work in this movie.

The revenge on the people harming your relatives by hurting the guilty ones shows always a good taste in film materials - strong and inspiring.

So I guess.. just be always there for all of your favorite people, relatives ones and so one. But this is just really small detail and I'm a virgo, so that explains it all. Great cinematography.

Really terrific work from everyone before and behind the camera here."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "\"Hell and High Water\" is a very 'odd' movie!! For the first 75 minutes you wish it 'would just get on' to where it is going though it does have 1-2 minutes of hilarity supplied by Margaret Bowman as a sassy waiteress who wouldn't take any guff from Jack Nicholson giving his order in \"Five Easy Pieces\" let alone from Texas Ranger Jeff Bridges! There is also a lot of give and take between Jeff, who will soon retire, and his Mexican-Comanche partner Gil Birmingham plus the bank robber brothers Chris Pine and Ben Foster.\r The screenwriter Taylor Sheridan offers sharp dialogue between the various 'couples', including an exchange between another waitress played by Katy Mixon who is flirtatious with Pine and then haughty with Bridges who wants to take her $200 tip as evidence. Where the screenplay goes astray is when it delves into the why of the bank robberies and leaves the clever based dialogue.\r The chemistry between older 'black sheep' brother Foster and the 'baby' Pine works from their first appearance to the end and Pine does clean up handsomely! The chemistry between Bridges and Birmingham is just as important between as it is between the brothers and all 4 pay off.\r There is no 'love interest' per se but both Bowman and Mixon women steal the movie from the more 'important' roles of the men. After that hour and 15 minutes of the set up the last 27 minutes grabs you and will surprise the most avid movie goer.\r \"Hell and High Water\" is a low keyed Western thriller cowboy movie  but that scene with Bowman is sure to remain in your herad long after the movie does.

More then than now? Achieving balance is an art that has become so scarce across media that it\u2019s almost a niche. What I appreciated most about Hell or High Water was its balance. Its character balance, its action balance, its scripting balance; all held together in a setting that was plausible, convincing, and, well\u2026 balanced.\r Action starts almost from the word \u201cGO\u201d, presenting a cast whose members are not necessarily adorable, but whose cause unveils itself over time, whether they be breaking the law or resolutely hell-bent on upholding it. The action itself never leaves you breathless, but the blend of determination by wrong-doers, or righteousness by law enforcers, makes for a homogeneous mix at a steady pace without precipitating into dullness, repetitiveness, or overstaying its welcome in the way that movies of this nature are so easily prone to. With its fair share of violence, the movie expertly steers clear of elements that could otherwise make it gratuitous and predictable. And although there\u2019s profanity, it is cleverly interspersed, delivering impact and realism while avoiding over-indulgence.\r Hell or High Water is a well done, rural, mild but sensible action-adventure that fires on all cylinders with suitable power.

The director and cinema photographer more than adequately capture and depict the mood and lifestyle of Western Texas and of those who reside there.

With terrific performances from Chris Pine, Ben Foster, and Jeff Bridges, Hell or High Water is a thoroughly unique family-fueled crime film. It may be a touch heavy-handed at times with its anti-bank mentality, but this is more than overcome by its terrifically crafted characters. The brothers are very multi-dimensional, as though they may be criminals, we feel for them deeply because of their circumstances and hope they can get away with it all. That said, even the cops are well developed. Bridges' character and his relationship with Gil Birmingam's character is terrific. Not only is their banter hysterical, but for friends and fellow cops, they are given a shocking amount of depth. In addition to its terrific writing, Hell or High Water is a sturdy film that defies expectations, as is tradition with David Mackenzie's films. He takes typical premises and more than just spruces them up. Instead, he reinvents it and turns it into a fully nuanced and powerful film that explores family relationships and how far you will go to help your family. Even more, it explores the violent nature of man and how thin the line between life and death is and can be. The film's cinematography is also terrific with some seriously beautiful shots strewn through this film. Not only did it capture the Southern aesthetic as previously mentioned, it really captured the look and feel of the towns it was set in.

Two Texas brothers on a bank robbing spree with Texas rangers and other law enforcement in pursuit.\r There are a few things that make this film stand out from other modern crime films. The motives of the protagonists are unique. They have a plan and a time limit. The locale FEELS authentic.The Production Design and Cinematography (Tom Duffield & Giles Nuttgens, respectively) are GREAT. I was immersed in the story and the world that was displayed on the movie screen. Also...I have to give credit to Nick Cave for the music. I\u2019m not a Country music fan by any means. But all of the music choices worked seamlessly.\r This movie balances action, tension and drama quite well. There is a pace. And at times, unfortunately, a bit of a languid pace. Especially in the  middle of the film. This didn't bother me too much as this gave room for the characters to develop. I cared for all of them. From the major leads to the minor ones who walked in and out of the story. All of them felt real. When the action does pick up again for the climax, I was impressed.\r Hell or High Water is on my Top Ten list for 2016. No doubt whatsoever. Excellent acting by the leads (Pine, Foster, Bridges and Birmingham), a great tension-filled story (with an ALMOST perfect ending), an immersive soundtrack and beautiful cinematography.\r A definite recommend. 8/10"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Reconozco que no ten\u00eda nada de ganas de ver esta pel\u00edcula cuando sali\u00f3 en cines, me parec\u00eda la t\u00edpica de oscar.

We do not see any more of those shoot-em-ups against the \u201cInjuns,\u201d but instead a blurred line between sheriff and outlaw. Yet most noticeable of all, it takes place in the here and now, rather than the turn of America\u2019s economic structure.Hell or High Water, written by Sicario\u2019s Taylor Sheridan, shows some of those gritty details that breathe life back into the shallow, feel-good classical genre. Here, we see what Texans under the law truly act like: they use a bulldozer to bury their P.O.S. car under dirt to hide any evidence, and they throw their chips in poker to increase their luck, all with the right rationalizations explained about their backstories to help you understand their turmoil. The two black-masked thieves we focus on here, played by the greatly underrated Chris Pine (Into the Woods, Star Trek) and Ben Foster (3:10 to Yuma, The Messenger), make a living out of hopping from bank-to-bank as the only means to financially secure themselves. You normally wouldn\u2019t want to care for a couple of crooks like them, but once you learn their background, you\u2019ll understand.Sheridan\u2019s plot is not a terribly original concept for a modern-day cowboy movie, virtually copying the same tone and concept as the brilliant No Country for Old Men. This Western only sets itself apart from others by its lack of international relationships.Even so, the hearts of all the men living here will haunt you. Each of them abuses their second amendment rights, even the filthy-rich passerby at the gas station carries firearms at all times. The town by no means chose to side with these crooks, especially not the near-retiring sheriff, played with a compellingly rich voice by Jeff Bridges (The Big Lebowski, Crazy Heart). Despite his wishes, he sets off a cat-and-mouse chase to restore integrity to these disturbers of the peace. Think of it like a Bonnie & Clyde type of thriller, except without the fun, gore, and romance. Or better yet, a Thelma & Louise type of criminal\u2019s sympathy story, except without any strong female characters.Yeah, hate to break it to you: Westerns today still don\u2019t contain enough girl power like we\u2019d expect from them by now. The female characters are either dead mothers we never meet, moral support for the main characters, or bankers who get harassed by the two crooks. If these otherwise talented actresses were made somehow more active, then greater dimension would have been added to make the script strike closer to home.Although the widely unnoticed director David Mackenzie deserves recognition for his compelling creation of Texas\u2019 true culture. In his view of the dead south, automobiles display the ultimate sign of one\u2019s wealth, and oil mines can be found in an average man\u2019s backyard. Although everything looks like the everyday mundane life for these inhabitants, several signs still connect Mackenzie\u2019s imagined world with the works of John Ford. A field fire seen in the distance from behind a herd of frightened cattle heightens the highly-saturated look of the picture, and the dusty texture of the art direction reflects the complexion of the men unqualified to protect the people. You even get a new take on the classic showdown between sheriff and outlaw- with a new psychological twist.Hell or High Water will last as one of those pictures made by men from the old days for men from the old days. Not everyone will come out from the experience satisfied, but for the thinking-type of viewer, Mackenzie\u2019s new take on a familiar concept will knock \u2018em out dead."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "This movie is the Las Vegas strip of cinema. It takes great elements from a huge variety of sources and recreates them in it's own, small world while providing only a minimum of context. They're amusing to see, but like the Eiffel Tower in the desert, you know that it's a pale imitation of the original.\r That said, this isn't a bad movie, but it's not nearly the masterpiece that the many 90+ critics' scores might lead you to otherwise believe. The entire movie feels like West Texas written and directed by a NYC film student who knows the geography and people only through watching other movies set in the same location. There are so many cliches in the character creation, the dialog and the cinematography that's it's a bit overwhelming, but contained within the individual scenes are plenty of gems that make the movie worthwhile.\r Bridges and Birmingham are walking on thread-bare, cop-partner carpet. Pine does his best \"Amarillo Raylan Givens\" imitation. Every scene is accompanied by some cliched Texas noir soundtrack music. Once in a while I wished for there to be no music so that I could decide myself on the mood of a particular scene. The recurring billboards on the side of the road are about as subtle as a Roadrunner cartoon. There is absolutely no chemistry between Pine and Ben Foster (his movie brother). There's no reason at all to believe that the two of them would be undertaking something like this together.\r But as mentioned, there are individual scenes that are poignant, funny, sad and pleasantly incongruous which make this a worthwhile spending of your time and money."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "High hopes for this in the worst summer for movies of all time.  Unfortunately it does not deliver.  What a let down considering the great word of mouth, solid cast and welcome genre.  Jackass critics over-praise yet again here doing nobody but the makers and themselves a favor!  The idiots obviously grade on a curve.  Do they give this mild effort a break only because everything else is so piss poor?  They're unfit to be giving their worthless opinions on anything.\rJeff Bridges is a very fine actor and one of the great contemporary movie stars.  Lifelong fan and he's in my top three favorite movie stars.  He's good here and all the funny lines are delivered by his character, but that's about all that's good in this film.  The script is weak on story.  Low stakes, high boredom with contrived characters in clich\u00e9 circumstances that have been put on screen countless times.  The motivating family backstory is not going to be bought by a thinking audience.  Obviously the writer and director were trying to comment on the modern West (actually its Texas here) with their dissertation in the forefront, and the lame story taking the backseat.  Major mistake and it never works.  If you want to do that then go make a documentary, write a book or become a painter because Hollywood movies should always be about strong narrative.  Any kind of message on the nature of things should be sub-text, always!  The audience needs a good story and the rest can filter through sub-consciously or even overtly, but the priority must be on story.  The rookies behind this either don't get that, or just couldn't come up with the goods.  (\"Sicario\" was a pretty phony and thin movie for that matter.)  The tone and craft of this movie are fine and that's what the sheep critics are all flocking around because they are very easily fooled.  It's a slow slog building up to nothing much.\r Also there is a ridiculous logic flaw in the plot, what little plot there is.  And not a flaw but maybe more troubling is a lack of moral subjectivity by the authorship of the film.  The anti-hero is nothing new.  What is are today's Leftist amoral filmmakers who don't pass judgment on extreme violence but show it matter of factly which is more realistic (except for the ubiquitous blood splatter now in shows and movies which is not realistic most of the time and in some ways the old code movies completely devoid of it are actually more realistic), however less reasonable for an audience looking for meaning.  The tone shifts from buddy joking to cold blooded killing by characters the filmmakers intend you to like.  That's not the problem.  The lack of more of a moral payoff is.  The danger is a culture heading for a complete lack of morality in the arts."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Went in with high expectations but was left unimpressed. The trailer paints the picture of a \"Robin Hood Cowboy\" tale which is only briefly seen in the cafe setting about 1/4 of the way through the movie.

There was nothing new to see here, I didn't feel the movie captured my attention, and would recommend you Redbox this one on a rainy day."}], "recommendations": ["a_most_violent_year", "news_of_the_world", "donnie_brasco", "beirut", "widows", "rush", "body_of_lies", "good_time", "the_accountant", "american_gangster", "the_place_beyond_the_pines", "man_on_fire", "true_grit", "the_devil_all_the_time", "lawless", "a_most_wanted_man", "suburbicon", "arbitrage", "the_equalizer_2", "argo", "bone_tomahawk", "casino", "nocturnal_animals", "ford_v_ferrari", "sicario"]}
