More of a documentary movie that tells how the Deepwater Horizon oil rig collapsed in 2010 due to oil leakage. It shows how the oil rig team and the BP oil company have different basic preferences. The oil rig chief engineer, Kurt Russell as Jimmy Harell, stands for safety first, and the BP representative, John Malkovich as Vidrine, goes for quick startup of the project at the expense of safety. Compromising safety led to the worst oil platform collapse in American history, resulting in 11 dead.

The film\u2019s biggest strength is that director Peter Bergh who, after watching this, you will never believe directed the abomination Battleship, really put the time and effort into understanding how oil rigs work and even went to an oil rig to learn it himself and as a result he makes some good technical information, without it being boring to the audience, plus his reliance on practical effects over CGI for the most of the film really pays off and makes everything feel more physical and have more weight to it.  If I have to have a bit of a nit pic, I do think Mark Wahlberg is slightly mis-cast but I would really recommend you see it especially in cinemas.  I saw it in an Imax screening and I think that\u2019s the best way to experience it and I am not sure this film will play too well on DVD and NetFlix."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "\"Deepwater Horizon\" was a simple and wonderful true story, real heroes on the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, Mark Wahlberg excelled in his starring role, and the rest of the characters, and include the work that Peter Berg She has done with this project."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "If there was a film this year more suited to being watched on a big screen then someone please shout up. Deepwater Horizon fills the screen with incredible stunts, effects and tension that if you are even remotely considering watching this movie then do not wait for the dvd and get to the biggest screen to watch it. The action is stunning, the tension will have you gripping the armrest, the grizzly injuries will have you chewing your fingers and believe it or not the emotional core will have your eyes watering. Based on the real life oil spill, Deepwater Horizon follows the men as they attempt to evacuate the exploding rig. They are all heroes for their ability to remain calm and follow evacuation procedures, but what makes the film so true to real life is that we don't have one main character being the hero for all, instead it shows how many go that little bit further to prolong time for escape. There aren't many near misses or dangling from ropes over canyons, what we have are major issues and characters navigating their way around in the safest way possible. Sounds as if this will take any tension away but in fact it doesn't instead placing the every man in their shoes. Mark Wahlberg is the lead name on the piece but in fact he isn't particularly for and centre of the narrative. It is more of an ensemble piece with certain characters receiving star names to portray them. Malkovich is great as the sneery BP spokesman and Russell brings a charm to Mr Jimmy with this pair's rivalry being one of the stories strong points. Wahlberg's chemistry with Kate Hudson feels real and the emotional impact upon their family brings a tear. There are problems. At times it is overly sentimental, especially towards the all-American hero, and the characters aren't particularly fully developed but regardless you see this for the pure tension woven throughout, from drill pipe tests to full on explosions. It is a very good film and one of the first that will have you fretting at the sight of high pressure mud."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This movie scares you on a level that is impossible for horror films to surpass. The brutal intensity of watching the employees burning, getting crushed, and receive injury in horrifyingly realistic ways effects you on a level not unlike director Peter Berg's previous screenplay, Lone Survivor. Deepwater Horizon does not delve into character development, but rather character depth. You get to know the cast by their personalities and how they react to certain situations they encounter.

This movie is one of the most intense movies this year. Peter Berg has a dramatic way of involving you within the gritty intense action that was based on a true event that happened not to long ago. His camera work made things feel not forced and the amount of CGI was exactly what we needed. He didn't overpower the effects and at times made it seem so very real as if it was an actually webcam type device that was within the pipeline itself.The acting from all angles was prestigious. They were all very well done for the limited about of development shown. Everyone from Russell, Wahlberg, Malkovich, & Gina Rodriguez made you feel what the emotions they where conveying. Like I said there wasn't much of character development but some how that wasn't needed because in the end you felt for every single character even the ones in one or two scenes.

The visuals and the way the film was shot give it some fantastic scenes that art breath taken,"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Director Peter Berg has found a niche. He is not a good director in the least. He is guy that claims to be \"one for them, one for me\", but his films continuously seem to be \"one for America, and then another for America\" at this point. Deepwater Horizon is no different. Yet, it is somehow a good film with a great sense of scope. A celebration of average joe heroes who saved lives during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and the negligence on the part of BP that led to this disaster, Deepwater Horizon is an accessible, smart, and powerful film that may pull a little too hard on the viewer's heart strings at the end, but is undeniably thrilling and a riveting portrayal of the disaster. It is not a film that rushes to the finale, rather building tension until the pressure is too much and the whole thing blows up into a cloud of fire.Mike Williams (Mark Wahlberg) is the Chief Electric Technician on the Deepwater Horizon. James \"Mr. Jimmy\" Harrell (Kurt Russell) is the head honcho. The two show incredible courage throughout the escapade and save people left and right, even after they are battered and broken. Casting Wahlberg and Russell in these roles is a stroke of genius as they are perfect fits for these modern heroes. Going above and beyond the call of duty, the men sacrifice themselves and their bodies to try and save as many people as possible. Racing across the ship to try a last ditch effort to save the rig and then jumping from the rig itself, Mike Williams' actions after the explosion are incredible, including saving multiple men from the accommodations. Injured and with one eye swollen shut, Mr. Jimmy is a man that never stops to take his hand off the wheel. Once he gets up, he is not going down again until everybody is safe and the rig is clear. Even afterwards, he calls roll to determine who made it off and who lost their lives. Wahlberg and Russell are classic tough guys and really show why in this film with good performances as these real life heroes.Yet, this really drives at the point of the film. Williams in particular gets the most character development of anybody with a wife and daughter waiting his return at home. He is a family man, the quintessential American. With a single American flag waving on the ship and in the aftermath (oh the national anthem call out, \"THE FLAG STILL WAVING OR WHATEVER\"...i.e. the flag is still waving as the rig burns in the background, poetic and overtly patriotic), Berg stuffs the heroism down our throat, but makes it work. The film is tense, thrilling, and action-packed. He may go too American and too hard on the celebration of heroes in this one, but these men do deserve praise for their actions and then patriotism is limited to just a few shots. In essence, he reins it in a bit for this one and lets the men do the talking.However, the key to this film is the explosion and the ensuing fire. With phenomenal sound effects and tremendous visual effects, this is where the huge budget for the film went it paid off. The film will probably not be profitable because of the budget being too high, but as a film, it really paid dividends. The film U-571 is still cited as one of the best films to test to see if a new sound system is working out well, but it may need to be updated to Deepwater Horizon. The sound is simply that good. The explosion, the chaos, and all of the tension leading up to it is impeccable and really what this film rides on throughout. Without it, Deepwater Horizon would not be nearly as good as it, especially considering how little meat is on this bone.  Using a pair of men as scapegoats for everything and not covering the punishments faced by BP, the film does include some real court footage but leaves out any information regarding the financial repercussions for BP. The only updates are regarding the dead and the two men who were shown in the film as being direct causes for the disaster. Unfortunately, the film does such a poor job of developing anyone other than Mike Williams, the death of the other characters are not felt at all, instead being reduced to background carnage. Seemingly recognizing this, Berg shows a montage at the end of the real men with their families. A touching moment, it does feel like a band-aid to make up for the fact that he only focused on one man for the whole film.Thrilling, entertaining, and with tremendous sound editing and visual effects, Deepwater Horizon is a film that is a bit thin with regards to its writing, but never ceases to be a powerful and utterly compelling experience. That said, boy does it ever do justice to Mike Williams and his wife. Not to be disparaging, as I am the last one to criticize based on looks, but these people are not Mark Wahlberg and Kate Hudson. Not even close. Few are, but these people are just your average citizens, yet Berg casts Mark \"Muscles\" Wahlberg and Kate \"Brad Pitt's New Girl\" Hudson as them. I would be honored if I was the Williams family."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Deepwater Horizon sheds a light on the events of the Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill that I was unaware of.

Because it was based on a real event, but there's nothing much about heroism which is essential for most of this kind of film and its success to inspire the viewers. I liked that. They just wanted to tell the story. Not to create a hero nor a villain. But due to the casting, Mark Wahlberg looks the centre of the story. And also points out a negative character without confirming anything properly. But if the film is depicting the real incident correctly, then it was no man's fault. It should be a technical error that led to the man's push over the limit.It's April 20 2010 about 60 kms away southern coast of the US in the Gulf of Mexico. A new batch arrives to continue drilling in the deep sea as part of oil exploration. When they felt they have got it, but it's only a back foot. Small small errors, following a big blow, the entire crew with the greater effort to stop it ends in vain. Finally, it is a matter of saving their own life than the drilling platform. With lots of action, how one of the biggest man made disaster in the recent time comes to end covered in the remaining part.From the director of 'Lone Survivor' and his part in the project was appreciable. It is another sea disaster theme like the recent 'The Finest Hours'. The film was mainly developed from the articles and also got nominated for the Oscars in two categories, but did not win any.
