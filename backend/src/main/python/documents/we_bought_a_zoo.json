The actor who plays the son isn't quite up to the task, and Elle Fanning over-acts to a fault, but, surprisingly, Scarlett Johansson is better in this than just about anything I've seen her in.  The restrained sexuality is what does it for her.  You don't have to bed the owner in the first scene to have value in the movie, Scar...."

The topic is peculiar, but not so attractive; and that happen because of the title, it tells you the main part of the plot and also it is not very catchy. But what seems a typical American story transform into an interesting conflict between a family that lost its pillar (the mother) who is struggling with its past, and this fight it can be notice in the desperate father, the misunderstood boy and the innocent daughter.What turns into a very promising movie fails in the development of the actions. The sequence is extremely predictable and the cute moments were overused.However the plot rises again with two things: repeated characters (Benjamin and Dylan have the same personality; and the something similar occur with Kelly and Lily) and the concept of 20 Seconds of Insane Courage. Although all this is wasted because of the predictable and never ending plot.The direction and the script are really poor; the performances are up to the movie and the theme turns to be interesting, but all the ups and downs in the plot make this film tedious to watch."

Matt Damon gives one of the best performances of the year.  Scarlett Johanssen as well.  There are some exceptions within the cast but even with their over the top performances they cannot take away the essence of this film and it's story.  This film is honest.  This film is sincere.  This film is real.  The family dynamics are excellent and the truth is that this film is better than the Descendants."

Before you go to see it be aware that it is rated PG; Matt Damon is not the Jason Bourne Matt Damon and Scarlett Johansson is not the Nola Rice (Match Point) Scarlett Johansson or the Christina from Scarlett Johansson from \"Vicky Christina Barcelona.\"The real stars of this movie are the animals at the run down zoo that Damon's character buys and Maggie Elizabeth Jones as his 7 year old daughter, Rosie. Ms. Jones will break your heart and make you want to take her home with you. The story is uncomplicated and predictable but it still works. Ms. Johansson works her usual magic on the male protagonist but in this movie its rumored that he spent more time in the hair and make up chair than she did. The supporting cast is just fine and the pace of the movie is much better than I expected. The moping teenage son shattered by his mother's death slowly comes around with the help of a teenage crush, the zoo gets opened and everyone has a smile on their face as the credits roll. This movie was made for movie lovers and not for the critics and award shows. Enjoy it for what it is; 2 hours and 15 minutes of light-hearted, feel good entertainment."

In my opinion the writer overreached to come up with all the \"feel good\" outcomes possible and crammed them into one movie.  So if you want to see a movie where all the people relationships turn out hunky-dorry and all the problems find speedy, nice solutions, go to this one and soak it in.  If you prefer something a little more realistic that keeps you guessing, go to any other show that's out there right now and it will be better."

The acting was phoned in, and the dialog eye-roll inducing. Matt Damon phones it in, and his little daughter is given lines designed to earn a cheap awww like \"we bought a zoo!\" which she says multiple times. The way emotion is expressed via loudly shouting things including \"why do you hate me man?!\" which Damon yells at his son in an emotional confrontation. The director missed a real opportunity to play with the idea of what happens when a whimsical purchase meets reality, and overcoming obstacles, but instead all problems are solved via deus ex machina and quick montages of people carrying around wooden planks and hammering nails. Rent when it comes out on dvd, if you must."

      "text": "Walter Ferris is uncool; he refuses a drink from Benjamin, not even water, as the men make their way to the lion enclosure. It's the day of Rosemoor Animal Park's final inspection, whose anticipated grand re-opening is contingent on getting a good review from the, mind you, zoo reviewer. The federal officer will not make friends with the menagerie stars. Somebody mentored this bureaucrat well. He's \"honest and unmerciful\". Not for nothing does the filmmaker cast Patrick Fugit, the Almost Famous star(here playing a zookeeper with an ever-present capuchin monkey perched on his shoulder), since Walter, arguably, is being a real friend to these people by writing what he sees in his audit, because a compromised examination of the animal park could result in needless endangerment for all parties concerned: the animals, the employees, and especially their prospective customers. As William Miller in the 2000 roman a clef, Fugit is told by rock critic Lester Bangs that \"friendship is the booze they feed you; they want you to get drunk on feeling like you belong.\" Walter, a critic of sorts, explains to Ben that he doesn't drink water, which for him, would be tantamount to accepting a bribe, later adding(after he gives Rosemoor its permit) that he never fraternizes, when the owner tries to include the examiner in their celebration. Similar to Creem's founder, Walter, too, possesses an encyclopedic mind, but instead of rock history, his mind is cluttered with more prosaic minutiae, such as zoo bylaws, and other rules and regulations that pertain to animal care and maintenance. The nature of his job precludes human interaction, a choice which results in loneliness. As he walks away from the open-aired jubilee, and towards the isolation chamber of his car, it's hard not to recall the scene between Hoffman and Miller, where Bangs, a self-made miserablist, and Miller, an outcast at his school, talk about the pitfalls of being uncool. In the real world, the filmmaker didn't follow Bangs' advice. He not only made friends with the rock stars, he married one. The casting of Fugit obliquely refers to this life choice, since Robin too chose people over animals(read: the filmmaker chose love over journalistic integrity), but his dedication to the monkey plays like a tribute to Bangs, because the zookeeper, quite literally, can't get the monkey off his back(read: his first love is still music). Bangs, who tells William: \"Women will always be a problem for guys like us,\" would have hated Benjamin for the same reasons as Walter, because \"good-looking people, they got no spine...and they get the girls.\" Walter leers at Kelly, and in the process, makes a pass at her, with a wink in his eye, since he knows full well that he's no match for the hunky owner, who looks conspicuously like Matt Damon. The flabby-chested man is no \"golden god\". It loathes Walter to pass Ben's efforts with flying colors, but he's a professional, who truly cares about the animals. For the ex-Rolling Stone journalist, who is making his return to narrative film after the poorly-received Elizabethtown, this film, adapted from the 2008 Benjamin Mee memoir, is not just a departure, genre-wise, but a pointed one, best-exemplified by the similarity of the film title to the anarchic moment in Almost Famous, where the band manager screams, \"You just bought a gate!\" after he gives the okay for malicious vandalism to the tour bus driver. In We Bought a Zoo, Ben is reprimanded by Kelly for referring to the \"enclosures\" as \"cages\", but semantically speaking, it's the same thing. We Bought a Zoo is a cage of sorts for this music-centric filmmaker, who is not normally this formulaic. Although in one scene, a grizzly bear breaks loose, the wild beast never truly gets a chance to roam, and is soon taken down by a tranquilizer gun. The filmmaker knows the feeling. Elizabethtown, lambasted by critics, especially the sequence where a grieving Susan Sarandon does stand-up comedy and tap dances to \"Moon River\" at her husband's funeral, which is then followed-up by a band who plays \"Freebird\". In lieu of the avant-garde-like experimentation of the film's final act(Claire's mix tape and map that the hero follows), We Bought a Zoo is more akin to \"I Know What the Caged Bird Sings\". Nothing. It's the rare movie in the filmmaker's oeuvre that popular music isn't foregrounded. Instead of Lloyd Dobler blasting \"In Your Eyes\" on his boombox into Diane Court's room, we see Ben stepping outside onto his front porch, where he listens to the found music of the animals, at dusk. Whereas the \"buzz\" that Jeff Bebe talks about in Almost Famous is used as a metaphor to describe Stillwater's music, in We Bought a Zoo the buzz is literalized, in which Ben wears a full suit to protect him from the killer bees, at the outset of the film. This time, the filmmaker's love of music isn't going to kill him. We Bought a Zoo is that protective suit."

Once again, he shows how underrated and versatile he is in We Bought A Zoo. This true story follows a man who is always looking for an adventure, and he found one when he decided to save a rundown zoo in southern California. I don't know about the book, but this film was so well written, that it seemed like it was finished in no time! Damon was great, but in my opinion, it's his son and film narrator, Colin Ford, that steals the show. Ford starred in one of my favorite movies, Dog Days of Summer, when he was younger and I've followed his career ever since. He's mostly had bit parts, but every time I see this kid, his performance just gets better and better, and he absolutely blows everyone away in this film. I'm usually unimpressed by teens in film, in fact I want to smack most of them, but Ford is definitely the exception, and really adds an important dynamic to this film. We Bought A Zoo is heartwarming, funny, and clever, the performances are top notch, and you will hopefully be as impressed as I was."

It turns out the movie was indeed very pleasant to watch, well worth the two hours of your 'entertainment time'.\r The cast has five actors I really like, Matt Damon in the role of Benjamin Mee, Scarlett Johansson in the role of Kelly Foster, Thomas Haden Church in the role of Duncan Mee, Angus Macfadyen in the role of Peter MacCready and Elle Fanning in the role of Lily. I discovered the talent of Collin Ford, who plays the serious parts as Damon's son; the best dramatic moments (realistic life moments) featured these two actors. I was also completely sold on Maggie Elizabeth Jones' performance; she steals the scenes she's in. This seven year old can charm even a cold hearted fogy; if you're a father or grand-dad, you're going to rewind her scenes.\r The early parts of the movie may lead you to think it will be just an okay comedy; wait because it does get better. The moment the Mees (father and daughter) set their heart on buying the zoo, the story might become predictable but I assure you, it won't matter if it is. The well written script makes it clear that the Mees were looking for a fresh start in their lives. The difficulties the Mees face with salvaging their zoo are matched by the difficulties they struggle (father and son) through to cope with the loss of Benjamin's wife, Dylan's mother. That role, played by Stephanie Szostak, is a timeline edited part. The editing and the musical score are very well done; these go a long way in making the film well liked by those who rated it."

The acting by both Matt Damon and Scarlett Johansson were both top notch while others in the cast went over my head with there over the top antics. The movie carries with it a more tragic aspect that (when addressed properly)  tugs right on the heart strings. The films comedic aspects are sometimes out of place but at other time (citing McReady going after the inspector) they deliver a good laugh. This movie may fall short to cynical people hoping for a darker ending but the ending itself dials down on the happily ever after aspect when Benjamin confronts his past and takes his kids  to the place where he met there mother.  Although Why Not? is supposed to be a main theme in this movie it is addressed only a few times which takes away from the impact of the final line of this movie, but not enough to make it annoying or useless. This movie suffers from some blunders and achieves in other instances, all in all it's a good wholesome movie that pushes away cynics and invites families."

At one point it really reminded me of Fierce Creatures (which I love!) when they were running around fixing things whilst an inspection was going on! Matt Damon and Scarlett Johansen were brilliant as usual.  It wasn't as funny as I thought it might be, but a good film all the same."

      "text": "Very dull acting. Plus where is the fun in a movie about a zoo a place with animals that instead of showing animals and being informative about the animals, not the documentary style, they could keep jokes about animals throughout the movie or examples of how different animals co-operate and live together therefor humans could learn from them. Instead of that or even animals in a zoo, it is a dramatic film of a family who faces adjusting issues from moving to one place to another. It really does not show that much of the other side of a being a zookeeper or a zoo owner. It is really boring, shallow script, dull acting, recommended to watch during the holiday seasons with the family during a rainy afternoon with cupcakes and hot cocoa but that is it! Not really interesting to watch this movie alone. You will get bored easily. You will really NEED someone to chit chat during the movie and something to munch while watching it!"
