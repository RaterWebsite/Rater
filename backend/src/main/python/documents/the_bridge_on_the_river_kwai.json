      "text": "The Bridge on the River Kwai is an excellent film, that says a lot more about the state of Hollywood in the time it was filmed than about World War II. There is some really stunning cinematography and beautiful acting, and this movie is just as worthy of accolades now as it was back in the day. There are a lot of errors in terms of realism and how characters would have acted and felt about the war, but that is kind of to be expected in a 1950s film. If you love classic movies, this is definitely one you should check out!"

      "text": "Some arresting location shots take centre stage in this pow movie that appears to somewhat explore the will of the human spirit to endure and overcome challenging hardships. Sadly it hasn't aged well and the slow pacing massively detracts from any tension buildup that might have improved the more dramatic sections of the screenplay."

      "text": "Un grand film de guerre ou plut\u00f4t sur la guerre et ses contingences, \u00e0 savoir celle notamment d'un camp de prisonniers o\u00f9 l'on se demande parfois qui sont les prisonniers et qui sont les ge\u00f4liers... Car si le Japonais est rigide et inflexible, l'Anglais est perfide et sournois. L'Anglais est \u00e9galement flegmatique et entre dans le camp au pas cadenc\u00e9 en sifflotant, tr\u00e8s soucieux des apparences et de... l'honneur ou quelque chose comme \u00e7a.On se demande donc si c'est du lard ou du cochon, du pudding ou du sushi... sans doute un peu des deux, mon colonel. Le Japonais m'a d'ailleurs l'air un peu mou du genou, voire d\u00e9pressif : moi, j'aurais commenc\u00e9 par faire un exemple et proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 une d\u00e9capitation au katana de quelques volontaires involontaires choisis au hasard. Apr\u00e8s tout, le colonel nippon (ni mauvais) se balade toujours avec son coupe-chou...Tout cela est un peu dr\u00f4le donc mais en m\u00eame temps tr\u00e8s s\u00e9rieux et solennel, surtout que David Lean conna\u00eet son affaire pour donner de la grandeur \u00e0 ses plans : il utilise le cin\u00e9mascope comme personne mais aussi malheureusement une \u00e9pouvantable \"nuit am\u00e9ricaine\"... Les acteurs pour leur part sont excellents, le fameux trio Guinness-Holden-Hawkins fait des merveilles, l'acteur japonais \u00e9galement d'ailleurs. Holden qui est bien plus que le ball\u00e2tre de service qu'on aurait pu craindre, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 son personnage inattendu en fin de compte.H\u00e9las, mille fois h\u00e9las, le film souffre d'un gros probl\u00e8me de rythme dans son dernier tiers : tout-\u00e0-coup, il se met \u00e0 p\u00e9daler dans la semoule et fait du surplace : on a alors qu'une envie, lui donner un gros coup de pied au cul avec l'avance rapide de la t\u00e9l\u00e9commande. Mais ce n'est pas tout : tandis que la fin daigne arriver enfin, celle-ci se ridiculise et le colonel anglais fait n'importe quoi parce que dans le sc\u00e9nario, on a fait n'importe quoi. Je doute que la fin du bouquin de Pierre Boulle soit aussi... grotesque.En conclusion, nous avons l\u00e0 un beau film mais qui s'\u00e9gare beaucoup trop dans ses longueurs et sa fin d\u00e9sordonn\u00e9e. Dommage, j'ai bien rigol\u00e9 au d\u00e9but mais aussi au milieu lorsqu'Hawkins manipule si perfidement (c'est-\u00e0-dire si britanniquement) Holden l'Am\u00e9ricain."

      "text": "a calculative allegory that symphonizes higher concept..The Bridge On The River KwaiThe Bridge On The River Kwai is a character driven war drama about a men with principles standing against the antagonist's camp as a protest with a never yielding spirit. The self-righteousness and morale conflicts is crafted with such nuance in here that the viewers never even questions it for once. And which then, breeds this portal of inner politics and torture and plethora of tactics like such, to convince and win over them in this mind game. The head to head arguments and political debates brewed among a pragmatic and brilliantly weaved conversations are electrifying to encounter on screen. Being aware of the innocence that these characters and brave tale is brimmed with, the makers easily draws out emotions from the audience that can easily melt you down. It is rich on technical aspects like background score, cinematography, editing and stunning camera work. Holden's practical and subtle portrayal is actually more than plausible but since the range offered to it, isn't as wide as Guinness's character that not only is given much more range and space but is also impressive as he flaunts it with such panache. The adaptation is smart and gripping despite of ticking for almost there hours, it contains a potentially jagged script. Lean's execution is always, layered and thought provoking where he takes its time eschewing the characters appropriately. The subjective procedure in here isn't crowded but competent and even busy that keeps the audience tangled in its chaotic and political war. Harrowing and mesmerizing images that shows both the aspects of the nature, inner politics in a camp and Guiness at the heart of it that fuels this war drama are the high points of the feature. The Bridge On The River Kwai is a calculative allegory that symphonizes higher concept through one's most simplistic nature."

      "text": "This film is very lightly based on a true story of British prisoners of war who served in the construction of Indo-Chinese railways during World War II. Of course, the film (as well as, perhaps, the book on which it's based) takes a lot of creative liberties and isn't entirely stick to historical truth, which is normally bad but, in this case, is mitigated by the quality of the film itself. In fact, the film seeks to use this incident to portray the madness of war honor: on one hand, we have a Japanese officer who will have to commit suicide if he doesn't complete the bridge in required deadline; on the other side, a daring English colonel who literally wants to take all by the book and demands the military status of the prisoners respected by his captors. Both collide at first but then end up joining forces, in a way that we don't even realize what side the English are because their pride demands that the bridge be ready on time and be very good! Alec Guinness is the most notable actor, with a truly exceptional role and performance, but William Holden and Sessue Hayakawa also deserve applause for the way they stand. There are other actors who have been great but I highlight these by the psychological game of their characters. There is a lot of psychology in this movie and its merit of this trio. Cinematography is also good, with warm light and colors giving us the true feel of the infernal heat of rainforest. Another point I want to highlight is the costumes, especially prisoners. An army of rags. A final word to Colonel Bogey March who, with the film, became one of the most famous military marches in the world."
