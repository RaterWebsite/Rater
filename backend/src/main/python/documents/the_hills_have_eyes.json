  "description": "Based on Wes Craven's 1977 suspenseful cult classic, The Hills Have Eyes is the story of a family road trip that goes terrifyingly awry when the travelers become stranded in a government atomic zone. Miles from nowhere, the Carter family soon realizes the seemingly uninhabited wasteland is actually the breeding ground of a blood-thirsty mutant family...and they are the prey.",

The Carter family didn't need to be attacked by the mutants, but they were. That's what Lizard wanted to do, and though emotional, it was awesomely done. You really feel like you know the characters before they kill them. It wasn't TRYING to do anything, I don't think. It wasn't shying away from the horror of what it would really be like to be attacked unawares by such vicious creatures. This was the most intelligently, well done movie I know of, and I loved it with a passion! Aja, I wish you would direct THe Hills Have Eyes 3 and continue the plot with Bobby, Doug, Brenda, Katheryne, and Beast."

The suspense and intensity of the scares is as high as possible; prepare yourself for repulsion and a cranked up heartbeat. I've never really gasped to a movie; I'm a guy, and a hardcore horror fan, but I couldn't help it at times.\r Despite the buckets of disgust and horror, though, the great cinematography, combined with that, make this a horror film to be remembered. Brutal, gross, creepy, and intense, it's almost not a movie, but an experience. True Horrror."

      "text": "Another insanely fun and gory film from Alex Aja. It started out kinda slow in the first half with really only one big attack scene in the travel trailer. The second half was much more thrilling, and I love how the Doug fought back against the mutants. Two minor problems though: I wish there would have been a bit more explaining for Ruby, and I would have liked to known a bit more about the mutant that used the walkie-talkie to coordinate attacks."

Maybe obvious comments for a remake, but the fact that it was helmed by Alexandre (High Tension) Aja raised my expectations considerably. What a shame he quite obviously caved into film-company expectations and just chucked out a standard mall horror. If I see another film that has a 'reveal all' from a wall covered in newspaper clippings, I will throw myself under a train, I swear. Occasionally bloody, but the completely one-dimensional characterisation and extremely dodgy political message are what really shock."

I remember seeing this film when I was 13  and really liking it a lot, so watching it again and seeing how I felt was fun. Aja directing is really fast paced that keeps you wanting to watch the entire film. This is great for the audiences that watch films for entertainment. Aja likes to use gore a lot in his films, so you know going into The Hills Have Eyes that there will be a lot of gore. The violence in this film is realistic and enjoyable if you"

There was some parts I personally thought was fake especially Brenda's rape scene and one crying scene. As for Bobby, he really was great. I believed that all his parts were well acted. and believable. Especially at the scene seeing his father getting burned alive. **** kill those **** Nice!! The make-up was outstanding especially for Lizard and Ruby. But the only thing that was disappointing to me was that in the 1977 version, Ruby was a normal human being. Then the re-make showed her as all deformed which I thought was stupid. Other than that, Lizard was badass!! But damn, that make-up was just done well. I mean, it was done very well!!"

      "text": "Wes Craven's 1977 original is a cult classic for good reason. It may have just been a toned-down, southern-fried version of his directorial debut The Last House on the Left, but it was a nasty, brutal film for the time with a creative setting and villains. This remake tops it in every way though, which is remarkable given how few changes were made to the script. The events are largely the exact same ones as before. Only portrayed in a harsher, more sickening manner with better acting and pacing. There's a more action-packed third act, it really hammers home a nuclear testing angle to instill the violence with a political message, and a much improved ending. That's really all that's different. Which, as someone who appreciates the original, but felt it was missing a little extra oomph, wasn't a problem for me personally.This is how you do a remake. It takes a flawed, yet respected movie and irons out a lot of its faults (sans things like the slow beginning and dumb characters), while imbuing the horror with an increased level of savagery and a lesser sense of silliness that it arguably always should have had. This isn't for the squeamish as it's definitely a product of the post-Saw, \"torture porn\" era of the mid-to-late 2000s where gore and depravity were matching the heights seen during the exploitation cinema craze of the '70s and '80s. If you have the stomach for it however, this is one of the best redneck cannibal nightmares you can find this side of House of 1000 Corpses.8.7/10"

As mentioned the start is strong acting and truly horrifying for a horror film, but blood and needless gore replace where there could have been more dramatic humanity and thrills. Worth a watch for its start, but a bit disappointing towards the end."

The first thing that this movie got right was getting Craven involved again which also happened with the remake of Last House on the Left. I'd say that the acting is above average. This film does have a few good jump scares but for the most part it relies on he terror of the scenario that the characters are placed in, the second act was really intense and it was probably the best part of the film. There are points where it gets a little gruesome but I just couldn't take my eyes off. The ending doesn't hold up after the intensity starts to tamper off but if you are a hard core horror junkie then you will likely enjoy this movie."

There were brutality, a lot of blood and killing. It felt somehow more like comedy, than horror or thriller. Nothing special or something I would recommend.

Even in this new age of meaty, blood-soaked torture-porn, horror films are able to maintain audiences' interests by either being legitimately interesting, or being brainless fun (pun very much intended). The Hills Have Eyes, however, is as dull and pointless as the protagonist's baseball bat. Scenes drag on for far too long, and the cast are completely incapable of making you care for their characters' safety. Yet, unlike better horror movies, the most annoying characters aren't even given the satisfaction of a gory death. Avoid this like a lumbering mutant redneck."

I found myself doing something I haven't done in the the movie theatre in many years -- shifting uncomfortably from the brutality and closing the fingers of my hand into a fist while wincing at the expression of pain on the screen. I found myself looking around the theatre thinking to myself \"95% of the the guys who blindly brought girlfriends or wives to this movie are going to pay a HEAVY price on the drive home!\" I am absolutely shocked that, here in Canada anyway, all you needed to do to see this movie is be accompanied by something over the age of 18.

I know alot people DON'T like it because it was so brutal and disturbing, well yes, it is disturbing.. but you really have to remember that it is a horror movie, and if you know anything about the original, then you wouldnt be so surprised about how much gore and blood they've shown. It's quite understandable that people would squirm and be uncomfortable, but before you go see a movie, perhaps you should research it and find out what you're going to be seeing. On another note, I thought this was a great movie, because they didn't hold anything back from you and you leave the theater feeling so shocked that you can't believe what you just saw! The actors are wonderful, in only about two hours they bring so much to their character that you believe they're real people, the make up artists had a heck of a job to do and they did it excellently! I mean, if you watch a movie, and all you get out of it is how horribly bloody it was, you're not really seeing it for what it really is, are you? You should try to appreciate how much time and effort so many people have put into it, and you might see it in a different light.

Sure, there were some gory scenes but I would've prefered more shocking moments instead of 45 minutes boredom before some slaughter scenes, which, in my opinion, weren't scary at all. Just gory. I have to admit that the rape scene was sick, also not scary though, just incredibly sick. I am really sorry that I seen that movie because of that scene but I won't have a hard time forgetting it. There are MUCH, as in much better and in many others, and more thrilling movies of that kind that I would recommend over this one. As another person said here: The movie is also easily predictable.
