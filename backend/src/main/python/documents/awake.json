Haydensen gives the same stiff performance he is famous for, there is a strange oedipal overtone throughout the movie, the plot \"twists\" are predictable (think absurdly when you predict!). Even the lasy line of the movie was predictable. The dialogue is clunky at best (\"My new heart will love you too\" Hahahaahahahahaha!) I laughed out loud when the credits rolled. Bad bad bad movie."

      "text": "This movie gets two big thumbs up for eye candy and the background story. The plot and flow of the movie however are both weak. This film is based on phenomena of anesthetic awareness, something we saw for the first time, 15 years earlier in a Tales From The Crypt episode. It was a great episode and seemed like it should make a good movie, but this wasn't it. Awake moves very slowly and is pretty boring for the first 45 minutes or so, and after that it just jumps around. Hayden yelling at people who can't hear him, gets old, quickly, but it continues to go on and on and on. It has a good cast, its a great idea, but it's only a decent story, and much too slow for me."

What it is, is an emotional thrill ride that adds an enitrely new dimension of fear to cinema. It involves the theme of powerlessness, and the narrative techniques illustrate how death parallels life. The performances are all sympathic, except for perhaps Jessica Alba, who didn't have enough range for her characters depth. Please see this truly suspensefull thriller that does for the operating room what Pyscho did for showers."

It's not a horror movie, and is less of a thriller than I expected, so if that's what you're expecting you may be disappointed. However, there are unique and shocking plot twists, and a fantastic end, which may or may not come as a surprising tear-jerker. It's surprisingly like The Invisible, so I would recommend it to all fans of that movie."

      "text": "If you're awake during open heart surgery, wouldn't you scream gutturally non-stop for an hour rather than have lucid prosaic thoughts about your pain? \"Awake\" plays like \"Next\" meets \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\". That last sentence sounded like a joke. That's my point. It's not a matter of if you think too hard, we're talking about thinking, period. \"Awake\" is unintentionally funny. It's Robin Cook gone meta. When one of Clay's ribs is cracked, he forgets to scream. Since Clay(Hayden Christensen) is rich, he chooses Dr. Jack Harper(Terrence Howard), a second-rate doctor, as an extension of his re-education, the crowning touch that follows his first subway ride to Brooklyn and sex with a working-class girl(falling in love with Jessica Alba is not hard). Clay wants to be one of the common people. But c'mon. We're not talking about eating at Taco Bell instead of a five-star restaurant; we're talking about open-heart surgery! \"Awake\" is a bad film; a hoot. But it's undeniably fun. Evil is fun. If you're going to make a second-rate thriller, it's bound to be fun if your main character recovers his memory. Alcoholic fathers in Santa suits are fun. \"Awake\" is painless. Clay forgets to scream; you'll forget to, too."

Jessica Alba's character is a terrible mastermind in killing somebody during surgery, she forgets to cover her tracks and avoid anything that can be used as evidence, Numerous surgeons including the anesthesiologist, don't act like real-life surgeons; not to mention Terence Howard's character has numerous malpractice suits against him, and who's only chosen because he's a friend of the protagonist (idiot).\r Anybody who had surgery and/or have medical knowledge, can point everything wrong depicted. This should be dissected, cooked and fed to starving kids."

      "text": "This is a really gripping movie, which is yet another of the 'not for the squeamish' type movies, if you don't like seeing medical procedures, scalpels, open chest cavities(!) etc. then you should probably give this a miss, although the scenes that include all of that aren't particularly overstretched, shall we say. The concept behind the movie is quite unsettling and the scenes of Clay walking around while he's really still on the operating table are quite spooky. Its pretty chilling to think that such things can happen and indeed the movie starts off with some information, statistics that mention 30,000 people a year suffer from this condition where their awake after having been put under anaesthetic. Of course 30,000 people out of millions means the chances of it happening are slim but watching the movie, the main part of it did come across as quite believable. I would question whether everything that happened would happen the way it did if it were real life (I can't go into much detail or I'd be giving away too much of the story) but the basic concept of being conscious while undergoing surgery is quite believable and it taps in on one of peoples fears - the fear of paralysis, if but temporary (or is it?). At the start of the movie, we see Clay has apparently stuck up quite a strong friendship with his surgeon, indeed he even encourages him to lay on the operating table one afternoon and to hold a scalpel, to get a feel for what was going to happen, warning him about the dangers and the chance of him not pulling through after surgery. Of course, he had been in hospital alot being on the transplant list, so he probably would have got to know those around him but looking back on it, it is a bit creepy to think how hard the surgeon, Dr. Jack Harper, worked to befriend Clay. I named this review the ultimate betrayal as I feel that it really is, at least its a big betrayal for a surgeon to decide to, for their own purposes, purposefully botch surgery and of course that makes it quite chilling, to watch as Clay shouts in protests and even sheds individual tears on the operating table but being unable to do anything physically to change the situation. I suppose its one of those movies that stays with you for a little while afterwards, it could enduce a small bout of paranoia even. Hayden Christensen does a good job portraying Clay, his voice straining to be heard in 'real life' and Jessica Alba also gives a good performance as Clay's newly married wife. The other main character apart from the surgeons in the operating room is Clay's mother, Lilith (played by Lena Olin), who isn't happy with the news she gets from Clay only hours before he's in hospital being prepped for surgery. One thing I found a bit convenient was why the medical team involved with performing the surgery hadn't been vetted somehow, that certainly crossed my mind but I suppose its a fairly minor point. Oh plus I did pick up on the fact that one of the main bad guys is of colour - I don't like to get into race issues but for some reason I did pick up on the fact that the only non-caucasian (or that I remember anyway) in the whole movie, let alone in the medical staff, happened to be one of the main villains, which I felt was perhaps a bit unfair but maybe I'm over thinking that, I don't know.The movie makes you question those you put faith in, the motives of others and it has some interesting twists which I hadn't seen coming. I thought the ending was perhaps a little rushed but then it had a good impact so maybe it was better being short and sweet - indeed the movie is only about 1 hour and 20 minutes long.As a tense thriller, yes I'd recommend this movie, as long as your not upset by the odd medical scene/your not too squeamish. The cast are good and the story is quite chilling, unfolding with a good few twists along the way. Its a gripping movie that makes you think, so yes, this is worth a watch in my opinion."
