      "text": "Good horror movies are few and far between and good horror sequels are even more rare. I had my hopes up for Sinister 2 because I was really surprised with how much I loved the first one and I think it was by far my favorite horror movie so far in the decade, however, one of the reasons that I enjoyed the first movie so much was because of Ethan Hawke's performance and it was obvious that he was not going to return for the second movie. They did bring back the deputy sheriff (James Ransone) from the first movie as one of the main characters so at least it wasn't all completely new actors.\r One of the good things about Sinister 2 is that the story really starts to expand what we learn from the first movie, but there is just too much more going on other than the horror story and those other plot elements are not nearly as interesting. There is still lots of the old terrifying footage shot on the retro camera that I really enjoyed from the first film.\r James Ransone really didn't have the ability to hold down one of the leading roles either. He really wasn't good at portraying certain emotions without sounding really sarcastic. There were some elements of Sinister 2 that were nearly as good as the first but there weren't many moments in the film that were. I would recommend this for a big horror fan but I wouldn't check this movie out until it hits DVD."

The cast is great, I still love Ethan Hawke. I felt that Sinister 2 is worn out and it should've been a decent movie. But I'd prefer Sinister 1 as my favorite time of horror movies I could watch right now. I think audiences (including myself) are going to be disappointed with this one. I hope there's not going to be another Sinister sequel, but it needs to take a break and probably just leave the original to where it stands. Wait for it on Netflix."

      "text": "Lighter on the terror, thought the new cast sympathetically keeps the tension running.\r Sinister had a good premise and twist that separated it from ordinary horror flick. This also means it was relying on the mystery aspect that was revealed at the end. The sequel loses the luxury of having the paranormal riddle. Instead of completely rehearsing the plot it utilizes different perspective and personalities, then combines it with dreadful bits to make a terrifying spectacle.\r Resuming the events from previous movie, now Ex-Deputy (James Ransone) is trying to sever the haunting circle by destroying the houses it affected. Unfortunately, there's a new family of mother (Shannyn Sossamon) and two sons who occupies one particular house. They are in danger of repeating the same terrible fate as previous victims, especially the children.\r James Ransone is a much different lead than Ethan Hawke was, he's more timid and less intense, but he looks very decent which should endear audience to his valiant effort. There's good chemistry with Shannyn Sossamon who is a great cast for the mother role, just like in TV series Wayward Pines. The two are not the typical family or paranormal whiz of recent horror movies, and this gives the characters a sense of urgency.\r There are bits of usual investigation involved, but the main draw is the perverted twist on the children and the eerie clips they made. These short clips are like snuff movies from children's point of view and presented with old cryptic filter. It may seem a bit similar to that of first film, but they are dauntingly effective and much more diverse.\r The children themselves don't look menacing and often seem like superficial apparitions. Unlike the original movie which displayed them sparsely, their appearance here is overexposed. It may have worked if viewers were introduced more to the children or the child abuse issue was treated with more polished, although unfortunately there's not much depth on the youngling characters.\r For most parts the scare looks average, coupling a few jump scares and taking hints from creepypastas. It loses the steam towards latter end since it becomes a tad predictable and the ghostly kids are hardly frightening, however the characters are adequately presentable which should keep audience invested throughout the unworldly predicament."

Bughuul actually popped up on a tablet at one point. The Super 8 scenes with the young Robert Daniel Sloan are particularly gruesome and the deaths in the film are ramped up to a much higher degree. It's clear that Derrickson is trying to position Sinister 2 as a possible replacement for Saw, especially if the level of gore is an indicator. But what Ciaran Foy needs to do is distance himself from these franchise horrors completely.  It's clear throughout Sinister 2 that he's polishing a turd as best he can, but isn't doing much for it. Let's hope his next effort, an Irish horror film set in the '60s, has better luck than this."

      "text": "When I had originally heard that there was going to be a sequel to Sinister, one of my favorite horror films, I was pretty excited to say the least. Then, early spring this year, the first official trailer was released. I suddenly felt less enthusiastic about the movie, but I still held on some hope that it could be a decent follow-up to the original, until I finally saw it tonight. I read the signs but ignored the warnings, and my punishment was an astonishingly disappointing sequel. Sinister 2 takes place some time after the events of the original film and follows Deputy So And So (that's seriously how he's credited in the film). He has become obsessed with tracking down murders and child abductions that could be linked to an ancient pagan deity named Baghuul, who coerces a child into killing their family and takes the child's soul. It leads him to a farmhouse near the site of a mass murder in a church which he expects to find empty. When he arrives at the house, So and So sees that a mother and twin sons have already moved into the house, and one of the twins is the subject of midnight show-and-tell with the ghost kids' kill tapes. From the first ten minutes, I noticed that something felt terribly wrong about this movie. Deputy So and So was nothing more than comic relief in the original film, and, outside of the big plot twist at the end, he can hardly carry more than a scene by himself, let alone an entire movie. While he is a generally likable character, Deputy So and So just isn't cut out to carry an entire film by himself. His character actually made the movie funnier than it was scary, and there was very little to be afraid of in this movie. If you've seen the trailer, and I'm not exaggerating, every single scare is spoiled in the trailer, and there aren't any surprises left for you. It seems like the filmmakers thought that showing Baghuul off as much as possible could make the sequel scarier than the original, but what made the original so terrifying is that Baghuul was just a shadow in the back of the tapes. You rarely saw him for more than just a glance, and it was scary as hell. In Sinister 2, however, you can practically count the buttons on his black overcoat because he's shown so profusely throughout the movie. Along with a ridiculously over-the-top abusive husband side plot, a weak script and bland direction, Sinister 2 is one of the biggest disappointments of the year for horror."

      "text": "The first Sinister introduced us to a interesting mystery and a creepy atmosphere, but ultimately fell short due to the fact that it never capitalized on any of that with anything scary. Sinister 2 might be even less scary. Outside of some unsettling use of a ham radio, all of the creepy factor is missing here. It even loses the original's seedy voyeurism.\r Despite that though I can't help but feel that this sequel is better than the original. It's just a lot more fun. No, it's not scary. We are treated to the same, predictable jump scares we've seen time and time again that we can see coming form a mile away. However the scenario is still very interesting. We may know the mystery, but even without the constant wondering about what is actually going on the plot can still manage to keep one invested.\r Part of this is due to the characters. They're a likable bunch played by talented actors. James Ransome returns as Ex-Deputy So-and-So in a plot that continues on from where the last movie left off. Despite being the previous film's comic relief character, he does well as the lead. He's still playing the same goofy character, and as a result there is a lot more humor this time around, but he's likable and brings a more human feel to this supernatural flick.\r I got invested in the plight of the mother and children on the run. No I wasn't always satisfied with what was going on onscreen, but I was entertained nonetheless. I went into this with zero expectations. The first movie was a disappointment to me and the trailers made this look straight-up awful. Imagine my surprise when I found a charming, amusing, although ultimately fright-less good time. It's a big, occasionally dumb haunted house. It won't scare you, and as a result won't satisfy your craving for a real horror flick, but will still provide some entertainment draped in the guise of a horror film."

So a sequel was expected and it failed to live up to the standards of the original. I would say, it was a decent horror film, with more story and drama than the creepy atmosphere. One character retained from the previous and the core theme remained, but tried a different method of narration. Something like 'Goodnight Mommy' with two brothers and mystery events surrounding them.\r It definitely lacks what a horror film required the most, and predictable too. But the story wise, it was decent, because the actors did a good job. So it is an average film. I expected a better ending and it did not conclude at its best leaving me disappointing. The way it ended might have been the suitable for the story, but I wasn't impressed. Again, another sequel is most certain, so I think this tale is not over yet and chances are very high that the story would follow with the same cast.\r It was not a bad flick, but not a follow-up you would have wanted. If you're looking for a genuine horror film, then you should skip it. There's nothing brilliance to appreciate at any level. Overall, I too felt it should have been better in some places. So my advise is if you forget its genre and try to enjoy that you're watching some movie that you don't know its category then surely would have a decent time with it.\r 4/10"

However, the infamous film reels are back on display in this film but \u2013 albeit being more inventive methods of killing \u2013 don\u2019t seem to come across with the same impact or shock value as the first films reels. Nothing recreates that lawnmower reel or the creepiness off the hanging reel that goes backwards. Henceforth, the real horror is not the scares in this film; it is the script. The dialogue is cringe-worthy and excruciatingly painful that I burst out laughing at times. It quite easily could\u2019ve been written by a pretentious 14 year old kid who writes scripts for his mum and dad, of which they tell him it is \u201cvery clever\u201d and \u201cbrilliant\u201d just to please the child.\rThe script is not the only horror show in display though as the acting is something that almost put the noose around my neck. The deputy was too goofy for the role and almost seemed to be making quips like as if he was in ant man or something. The mother was mundane and the children were just typical child actors. The abusive father was overacted and also \u2013 referring once again to the script \u2013 an unneeded addition just made for increasing the run time of the film. To be quite honest though, if they decide to make another Evil Dead remake (I know don\u2019t reboot it again like Spiderman) that the deputy played by James Ransone would make a great new Ash.\rIf I had to be honest though I did enjoy this film, but due to the fact I ended up seeing it as a comedy. Some scenes are so stupid, some acting is so bad and some dialogue is so awful that you can\u2019t help but laugh at it; especially at a certain car collision scene.\rHowever, this literally is the first horror film that has actually bored me. Insidious 3 wasn\u2019t a very good horror movie but it still kept me watching and jumping from time to time until the end. Sinister 2 had me interested at first and then slouched and bored in my seat hardly moving an inch at the lazy jump scares towards the end. But with all that I can\u2019t miss out the fact that this is yet another horror film with a terrible \u201ccliff-hanger\u201d ending. Why can\u2019t we get good writers for horror films anymore?\rOverall, Sinister 2 is a bad and unintentional horror comedy that does nothing to distinguish itself from the grey colour palette of the current horror genre. And lastly, the \u201ctwist\u201d was once of the most obvious and unimaginative things I\u2019ve witnessed in a while. It added nothing, and didn\u2019t even try to make itself cryptic.\r3/10"

This case is just another one that follows that line. If the first film was very good and worked quite well, this one has turned out to be much weaker.In fact, this film repeats, with some nuances, the same formula that we saw in the first one, without the advantage of the element of surprise that worked very well the first time. Once again, we see a house haunted by Bagul, an evil entity that turns children into murderers of their own families. Again, we see an innocent family being victimized by this entity, while a retired policeman, whom we saw briefly in the first film, tries everything to save them.Ciar\u00e1n Foy assures the direction whereas Scott Derrickson, who directed and wrote the first film, limited himself to signing the script this time. Maybe that's why the film is never as good as the first. It manages to create a tense atmosphere around the house and the evil that surrounds it, but the fact is that we already know what that evil is and what its capable of, so everything that follows is easy to guess. The film has its good moments, there are some scares that work well and make the film worthwhile, but in general it is much weaker.James Ransone was good enough in his role and is supported by Shannyn Sossamon, with whom he seems to collaborate quite well and create a convincing chemistry. Robert Daniel Sloan, given his age and inexperience, was very good, while Dartanian Sloan was weaker. At a more technical level, the film closely follows its predecessor, with an elegant and well-made cinematography, especially in the footage that reproduce the home movies. The soundtrack is very good, but it seems copied from the initial film, with slight additions."
