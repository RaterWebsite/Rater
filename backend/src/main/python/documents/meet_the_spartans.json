I just saw this movie, and as a very big fan of 300, it is just a bunch of fun watching a slack hangover idea, and it isn't that funny once you get into it. But despite that, to settle the results, this movie was surprisingly good. It is very pleasant, the acting was terrible, but from what I saw, they intrigued me, their ideas are very basing and never off colour when relating to each movie. Anyways I thought it was a blast, much better than last year's Epic Movie crap. And the quality was actually very good, good screenplay, and good script too."

Meet The Spartans speeds by in a single harrowing day. It grips you in a vise of suspense that Kiefer Sutherland couldn't hope to match on 24, even with that show's tricked-up editing. There are no tricks up the sleeve of writer-director Aaron Seltzer. Most of the time his camera hunkers down rock-steady and observes. The subject is humanity and its oppression. And like the best political films, its focus is intensely personal."

It was a simple hit and miss comedy with hits like the Spartan skipping along and singing i will survive and misses like the opening Shrek joke. Unfortunately the misses outweigh the hits. Also I don't know what the casting director was thinking when he was hiring impersonators because they do not look like the people they are trying to. I think it was achieving what it was meant to a few cheep laughs but it wasn't great at that. I say wait for the DVD. Official grade C."

Sure it's not winning any awards and some of the jokes just miss the target, but there is enough here to keep you entertained and have a good laugh, especially if you're in need of one. Sean Maguire is quite funny as Leonidas and the cast are overall quite funny. It's not the best spoof film out there, but not the worst either so it's worth a look for a laugh."

      "text": "As much as I understand why people love artsy movies like Schindler's List, which is in fact a good movie, what I do enjoy the most is a good comedy. It's no wonder I liked this movie, really, as I've seen every Family Guy episode to date, and Scary Movie 1-4, and I loved them all. It seems some people are under the impression that pop-culture references are not jokes. But the point of a joke is to make you laugh, and that's also the point of pop-culture references. With that out of the way, on to the actual review. Meet the Spartans is a sea of pop-culture references, that doesn't border on being overkill, it throws itself headlong into overkill. To truly enjoy this movie, you may need a strong knowledge of American culture, so if you live in the USA, you are all set. But if you live in Europe, you would benefit from studying up on general USA life. I am a European myself, and I can say this, watching Family Guy and South Park really helps. If you enjoy these series, or Scary Movie, you are much more likely to enjoy this movie. It's overflowing with hilarious pop-culture references and, while short on original jokes, it works fine anyway. So, go see it, unless you're hooked on The Godfather. And to all the people who think the ones who like this movie are idiots, I am 14 years old, and English is not my native language. Yet, here I am, writing this elaborate review, proving that you don't need to be stupid to see this movie. In fact, it's the complete opposite. You need to be intelligent to enjoy this movie. Perhaps you will see the movie, perhaps not. If not, you are definately missing out on something great. And with that, I leave you all to your thoughts."

Also is the same as nearly every other parody movie that has ever been written. I strongly suggest you don't ever even think about watching this film. The only reason I scored it as 1 is because it is indeed a film, and yes they used a camera to film it, that is all I can take away from this dreadful experience."

      "text": "This movie is chock full of terrible humour, if it can be called that. We know this. We knew this before the movie came out, we knew this during its theatrical run and, six years after its release, we still know this. As a comedy, this film fails on all counts, because it's brutally unfunny. This film represents the very worst of American comedy. This is comedy that's gone through liposuction, and is suffering the immediate after-effect. It's painfully boring, painfully unfunny and painfully painful.\r And what makes this even worse is the fact that Seltzer and Friedberg could actually be... talented. Bear with me for a moment, let me explain. Look at this film. While the humour and the parody (i.e. the reason we're watching the movie) fail, this film is competently made. The camerawork's quite good, as is the lighting, and I think, if it wasn't a comedy movie, the writing could be acceptable. If Seltzer and Friedberg were to sit down and try to write a decent story with decent dialogue that relied in no way on humour or wit, it would be decent.\r It wouldn't be astounding, but it'd be decent. If they pushed the actors far enough, they could deliver good performances, I'm sure of that. I seriously doubt that all of the guys in this film are actually bad actors. Greg Sestero isn't a bad actor, as much as The Room will make you think otherwise. And I think a lot of the cast of this film could give decent performances. Not great, mind you, but decent. I think, if this movie were different, not a parody film but an actual movie, it would be decent. Certainly not great, probably not good, and maybe not even average, but it wouldn't be as absolutely god awful as this was. This film is a failure on almost all counts, and shouldn't exist."

I think that Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer realized their movies suck so bad, since they can not climb the \"I'm original or funny\" ladder, they must go in the opposite direction as fast as possible. Yes it was like YouTube clips put together by a 9th grade Audio/Video Club. But look at the sheer brilliance of how they picked the most boring material that can be gathered at the time. Happy Feet with a black gansta attitude? American Idol and Dancing with the Stars reviewers? I mean truly think they said to themselves \"what can we add now? Quick turn on the TV. Hey American Idol - put that in there. Hey Miami:CSI put that..no wait dont put that in there, it's funny. Ok look at youtube for an idea. Wait how about a transformer with a youtube video on it? Hurry up, this script needs to be done by tomorrow morning\". So I give it a 10 for being the ultimate unfunny, boring rehash of unfunny, boring pop culture references that will definitely leave anyone between 11-70 wondering \"didnt the actors who read the script realized this is lame?\""
