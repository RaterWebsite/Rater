She walks thru the rest of the film as a cold wet bird struggling to find herself.I have no doubt that this film, which netted J Law unprecedented millions of Denaro for just showing up and talking in a concocted Russian accent will get the Oscar nod during award season.The plot is mostly about loss, yet at times I am at a loss for words. She breaks her leg in a freak ballet accident (who knew ballet could be so dangerous?) and then things just keep getting worse for her along the way, including a couple rape scenes.Spoiler Alert: J Law couldnt hit a golf ball inside of a steam room of the local Russian YMCA to save her life. She should definately stick to being a ballerina.The film was formidably watchable for the most part only until the end where a plot twist that makes absolutely zero sense occurs. The confused little bird tries to make out with her uncle and then strangely gets him shot just to upset her American lover. If this moment was important then the director certainly failed to build it up. Makes me think Rian Johnson rewrote this script it\u2019s so bad. Go see it, but only if you like torture (literally)."

      "text": "Jennifer Lawrence is all grown up, graduated from the Hunger Games and is now attending Sparrow School. Seducing men and getting everyone killed in the process.Dominika Egorova (Jennifer Lawrence) is a witness to a crime she shouldn't have seen, so her only option is to become a Sparrow. A secret Russian intelligence service who specialise in training young agents to use their bodies as weapons. Not the fighty action James Bond kind of way but more in the seductive and manipulative kind of way. They can also pick locks so as far as the training goes that's about it. Dominika finishes Sparrow school as perhaps the most deadly of all the sparrows. Capable of using her mind and body as a weapon, her mission now is to get information from American CIA agent Joel Edgerton. The plot gives you all the information you need to figure out what exactly is going to happen before it happens. The twists and turns don't offer much in the way of surprises and at 2 hours and 20 minutes you can bet there's a lot of them. What it does offer is a good enough espionage movie packed full of violence and torture to peak your interest. At the very least it got my attention, so although the story is dragged out for much too long it manages to pull itself together into an \"only gonna watch it once\" popcorn flick. Much darker than I expected which is enough to separate it from the usual generic stuff. This is probably the best performance from Jennifer Lawrence in a while, not enough to get the bad taste left behind by\u00a0Mother!\u00a0but it's a start. Recommended if you've seen all the Oscar movies and looking for something a little different."

      "text": "Red Sparrow is a lot like last year's Atomic Blonde. Both films are about femme fatales, both films take place largely in Russia, both films have twist and turns in their spy thrillers, both films use some bold colors (Atomic Blonde blue, Red Sparrow red), and both films are by the number spy thrillers that are not interesting. The only different is that Atomic Blonde was at least fun and did not have really uncomfortable undertones like Red Sparrow does!One thing that I can absolutely give Red Sparrow credit is that it is a technical well made spy thriller. Francis Lawrence, most known for directing three of the four Hunger Games films, as well as I am Legend, isn't exactly an interesting or stylish director, has definitely stepped up his game, making a visually striking film with some great use of red color hues. I won't call this movie stylized really and there's not a lot of subtly and substance to really analyze, but there is certainly a lot of interesting shots that does feel pretty cool. The score is also pretty great too, being done by James Newton Howard. It's largely classical inspired and even using classical pieces, that both fit the film and adds a bit of tension and even beauty to what is going on. And that's about it for the positives really.I mean the acting is alright really, but these characters are so bland and by the numbers they just feel like carbon copies of characters you've already seen before in spy thrillers. This is very much true for Jennifer Lawrence's character, Dominika or as she is referred to \"Sparrow.\" J-Law has proven to be a great actress, and she goes as far as she can with her role, even with her fake Russian accent, but her character is so flat that her natural charisma does not elevate her role as far as we really want. Add to some stale chemistry with Joel Edgerton, who is shockingly bad in this film, and any sex appeal from this movie is gone down the drain.Speaking of bland, this story is just so dull! It's nothing you have not seen before, the plot is convoluted and hard to follow at times, and it's just so long and the film drags! Like I was so bored by this dull movie. It's not a constant fun, action-packed spy film and more in the vein of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, a spy film more about wit and intrigue instead of being action oriented, which I can respect. But like I have to care about what I am seeing, which I do not! It's just so uninteresting.And not to mention really uncomfortable! Like this movie is super graphic with it's violence and sexual imagery. Like there is a scene in the film that basically was going to full blown rape, I am not kidding. This is to add to some feminist subtext with the film, but with how needlessly graphic the film gets, and really analyzing this movie in a feminist critique it is incredibly shallow. Sparrow doesn't do much work on her own as she basically has to be told what to do, including having a man forced upon her! Yuck! I can somewhat respect this movie if it was at all handled the touchy subject respectfully, or just full blown exploitative and unapologetic, but it never goes that extra step and just feels like a tepid mix of Tinker Tailor and Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. Maybe the book did it better but I have no interest in picking up the source material after watching this.I can't hate this film too much because it is a well shot movie and the score is good, but it's just a long, boring, and uncomfortable slog to sit through. It's too boring for a spy film, too shallow for a feminist movie, and too scummy for J-Law fans. Just skip it altogether!"

      "text": "what have you done..Red SparrowBeing rich and clean visually, the feature endorses intensity and practicality capturing some indigestible brutal scenes depicting the clear genuine effort and hard work that went behind the stage which unfortunately makes it more sad in the end as it nullifies everything to zero. A common mistake while creating such character driven feature is that if the characters and the offered environment to the audience isn't intriguing enough to invest in it, the movie starts to fade off slowly but surely in front of their eyes. Francis Lawrence is definitely not short on execution but what lacks is enough material to feed the audience for more than 2 hours and hence fails to offer any lose thread to hold them. Jennifer Lawrence aces on her side of the act and is supported too with a great cast like Joel Edgerton and Jeremy Irons saving the 'performance' objective of the feature. Red Sparrow is a slow pill whose attempt may be admirable but won't connect to the viewers in any tone for it fails on offering gripping content, better editing and a genuine reason or soul."

      "text": "Usually, the best thing about a movie Jennifer Lawrence is in is her being in it and she is the best thing in \u201cRed Sparrow\u201d.The set up is simple with a Russian ballerina suffering a career-ending accident during a performance and is forced, by her pedophile uncle, to go to a Russian intelligence school referred to \u201cSparrow School\u201d, where sex and body are used as weapons, in order to continue taking care of her sick mother.From then on we are watching a convoluted screenplay by Justin Haythe that is even more confusing when tried to explain at the end and, in my opinion, does or doesn\u2019t point a finger at the mother.The sex, of which there is plenty, and a lot of nudity, is gratuitous and worse, boring. The violence is almost to the point of the audience vomiting along with some of the movie\u2019s characters. The British Board of Film Classifications had the film to take out parts of a particular scene\u2014I wish they had taken it out completely!\u2014to get a less certification for strong, sadistic violence. Rated is \u201cR\u201d in the USA for \u2018strong violence, torture, sexual content, language and, yes, smoking\u2019!The direction by Francis Lawrence is haphazard and very slow moving for what is a spy thriller. The \u2018love story\u2019 is far from believable and there doesn\u2019t seem to be any \u2018heat\u2019 by the two stars.Jennifer Lawrence has a couple of striking scenes, one as the ballerina and one of her in a sparkling red dress that is more interesting than anything that happens in this movie.Her co-stars do their best but with a bad script, a very talky, slow-moving 139 minutes spy thriller that doesn\u2019t really thrill, \u201cRed Sparrow\u201d a book trilogy should start and end with this one."

I still don't know the reason?, I guess the director just wanted to see her nude and in that manner, so that brings me to -> is this casting (director, plot writer, etc) a casting of criminals?

The middle ground where this lies is an okay movie about a ballerina that becomes recruited to be a spy for the Russian government. Sounds pretty \u201cmeh\u201d right? Yeah I thought so at first too. There was no style or flare to it at all either, there was just more focus on its character moments that were overdrawn to highlight some plot details that were missable. The film was marketed in a way that could be mistaken for a spy action thriller, but there was barely any of that too. The action that did happen was brutal and quick but really at times served as plot devices to move the characters\u2019 story along for the sake of the film, and at a certain point for the sake of runtime, this **** was long.Overall, Jennifer Lawrence doing a Russian accent for over 2 hours is pretty interesting, but the rest of it didn\u2019t deliver like the music of the film thought it did.

Then in order to help she and her mom to have a decent life, she got a invitation to get in a school to become a sparrow by her uncle, that school trained her to be a sparrow, agents that work for someone in favor of get information with the sensuality, approaching of targets using her body. Based on a book and directed by Francis Lawrence.The story of this movie goes in a slow rhythm, it does have a dark aspect and emotionless. I liked the tension that was in the story, and it made me believe that pretty much everyone was in dangerous, not exactly made care about them, but did me believe that anyone could go any time, by any stumbling. The core of the movie is very interesting, and the way that they explored it was very good, showing her training, and demonstrating how did she learn those things was very good. The big problem is that the movie tries to imply a confidence and assurance that really comes out of nowhere, things that happened to fast and didn't felt organic or natural, it felt rushed and even senseless, wich is curious considering that the movie have 150 minutes, that's a lot of time and still things felt out of palce, crucial things, a character that was supose to be rival with the other and just start to believe in the other out of nothing felt really wrong and took me out of the movie. The story goes in a way that during it a lot of things happens that doesn't make sense at all and feel dislocated, but at the very end it is explained and combined it does, wich i like. It does have some plot twists, and the movie kind of tried to make the viewer not to be sure if the character was in one side or other, wich i also liked.The acting wasn't a high point in this movie, even considering that the film was indeed with a purpose of emotionless, but i really don't buy it in every moment. Jennifer Lawrence character was the perfect example of emotionless, she didn't had much faces in this movie other than that poker face, she could show fear in some moments, but normally, in moments that she should pass me a woman that is looking to care of someone, in her eyes or voice tones, she didn't delievery this other part, just seemed to be a wall. Joel Edgerton also didn't had much expressions, but i could buy him caring about other characters, and his devotion into a purpose, it didn't convinced me 100% but it wasn't bad. Matthias Schoenaerts was kind of the older relative, that always had advice, he was a little threatening and i believe that he did a good job. Charlotte Rampling, showed confidence and was certain about she was talking, i completely bought what she was talking, she did very well. Jeremy Irons doesn't have a lot of screen time, but the little he convinced me, he was cautious and it convinced me.The cinematography of the movie don't talk much to us and isn't the most pretty neither, but is worked in some moments and helped to creat this emotionless scenario. There are some moments that the character are explaining what they are going to do and are already showing the thing happening, that was very nice. The soundtrack isn't memorable and doesn't call much attention neither.The movie makes everybody talk english with a russian accent, sometimes that didn't worked out, it was like if they just forgot about it in some scenes. The movie also forgets some characters that they had. The movie have problems of continuity, it does have sequences that doesn't take nothing to nowhere, comes with some really uninteresting things, and that took me out of the movie sometimes as well. The character does not have layers, taking away one or two. There is the villain and there is the hero, and you needed to choose between them.The movie also in some moments have a nice mystery, it does have some sequences that are really entertaining, it does have some nice twists and tense moments, it does have a nice editing. The intensity of what happens is really high, it is brutal, it can be gore or even make you want to turn your head in some moments, it does have some triggers that keeped me interested in it, and have a nice ending connecting things that happened before, even if some are a little forced.This is a thriller of espionage that doesn't have much new, and have a bunch of flaws, but definely have some good things right there."

      "text": "Jennifer Lawrence in the lead role in a Russian agent film. I have to say I liked the beginning and the end very much, it was sometimes disturbing, very exciting and also very brutal (especially when it comes to the torture). Actually, I have nothing to complain about except with Lawrence's mother, which I found a little weak.Lawrence had to give up her ballerina career and take the path of an agent who is supposed to get information primarily with her sexual stimuli (especially the training in school 4 was very extreme). So far, actually quite good, unfortunately the film lost me a bit in the middle part, there was hardly any tension for me and the whole thing was babbling to itself.As already mentioned at the beginning, the end is impressive again and the clasp succeeds (e.g. the glass). All in all, a film worth seeing for me 8/10 Sparrows."

Lawrence is utterly mesmerising, and the savagery she brings to the brutal action sequences, coupled with the cultivated vulnerability of her appearance is breathtaking. The pacing is slower than one might expect, though it quickens in the third act, but the true pleasure is to be gained from the twisted plot which truly keeps the audience guessing even in the final moments. There is a raw edge to this film, which makes the violence more visceral and disturbing than other recent genre pieces, resulting in a film which is more affecting than anticipated. 8.43/10"

The story evolved quite unexpectedly and the movie overall had good cinematic too it. One thing I didn't like at all was the \"Russian accent\" which seemed way too exaggerated and thus made it harder to focus on what's really important. Otherwise it's a movie I'd recommend."

      "text": "Like many others, I didn't know much about the film prior to seeing it. I was expecting a female driven James Bond espionage movie, but to my pleasure what I got was something entirely different. Red Sparrow is not an action-packed spy movie, but that doesn't mean it shies away from intense and brutal scenes. The typical spy movie action that I'm referring to consists of chase scenes, drawn-out fight scenes, improbable stunts, and so on. This movie doesn't really possess any of those qualities. I know there was some controversy surrounding this movie. Some were upset and under the impression that it was politically charged, while others thought the movie was misrepresented through advertisements. The movie was unexpected, but not in a bad way. I think that for people that expected and looked forward to a typical spy thriller were let down. Also, I understand why some people thought the violence and nudity was gratuitous considering they were expecting something more appropriate. Personally, I didn't think the violence or nudity in this film was gratuitous by any means. But I am someone who sees a lot of films from a broad spectrum, so it's hard for me to be offended by what I'm seeing. As far as the actual film goes, it was good. There were definitely some problems with the film as far as character development goes. You have a hard time really understanding the protagonist, whether that's by design or not is unknown. The relationship between Jennifer Lawrence's character and Joel Egerton's character will create a lot of questions; it doesn't seem natural, and the chemistry just wasn't there. The twist at the end is pretty good though, and was definitely the best part of the film. Well, that and Jennifer Lawrence's amazing acting yet again. I would recommend seeing this film."

Lawrence delivers a good performance as usual. I was impressed with the supporting cast as well. The twist at the end was fantastic.  It's not perfect, but it's enjoyable if you like spy films."

      "text": "Please do not assume based on these reviews that claim this is a bad film. It's not. It's frankly disappointing to see a movie like this being given such poor marks, especially from audience members. The main complaints seem to be that the film is slow, boring, and poorly written. Those who are voicing these complaints probably worship Marvel films and need a gratuitous action sequence every 3 seconds. On the contrary, the character development of Red Sparrow is spot on. The film is gorgeously shot. James Newton Howard's score adds tension in just the right areas. The action scenes are spread out, making the film more dialogue-centric; but that's what makes it so gripping. Those with small attention spans should wait for the next Mission Impossible or Thor sequel 32... while others should go and appreciate the true slow-burn thriller that Red Sparrow has to offer."

This is an unapologetic brutal film, a rare find for a big release nowadays. I felt a very Fincher-esque vibe with this, and I think that was the intention.If you enjoy a slow burn, old-fashioned spy thriller; this is a must-see."
