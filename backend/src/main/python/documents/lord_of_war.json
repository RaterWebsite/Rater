The characters mean something to you backed by an ironclad story and top rate performances. We are given another perspective of war.....the business side, and the result is shockingly entertaining!"

      "text": "All at once a character study, family drama, black comedy, and surprisingly accurate look at the world of a gunrunner, Lord of War is easily one of the lowkey better films of 2005. Nicolas Cage is fantastic, and his supporting cast comprising of Ethan Hawke, Jared Leto, and Bridget Moynahan are more than capable in their respective roles. The script is dark and biting, but never shies away from its anti-war message. The strength of this film is it's focus on the black market, rather than on war itself being evil. This is a movie I definitely recommend."

Et comme Ponce Pilate, il s'en lave les mains, lui et les autres.Tout le film fait preuve du m\u00eame genre de cynisme emball\u00e9 dans une ironie de tous les instants (ou presque), un choix qui le rapproche sensiblement d'une com\u00e9die mordante et un choix fort judicieux \u00e0 mon avis puisqu'il fait r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir le spectateur tout en le faisant ricaner et plus si affinit\u00e9s.C'est d'ailleurs tr\u00e8s souvent la bonne m\u00e9thode que de manier l'ironie cinglante et la satire pour d\u00e9noncer les absurdit\u00e9s du monde, cela \u00e9vite en effet un mis\u00e9rabilisme malvenu.Lord of War est donc bien r\u00e9alis\u00e9 et m\u00e8ne sa braque exactement l\u00e0 o\u00f9 il veut en venir malgr\u00e9 h\u00e9las quelques faux pas.

      "text": "This film, allegedly based (very lightly) on actual events, tells the story of a Russian-American gun dealer and confronts the immorality of the war and arm business. It would even be depressing if it weren't ironic. Irony is the key to perceive the taunts of a film that takes for granted the inevitability of violence: just like food, death is a human need and man will always feel the urge to kill his fellow man. This provocation is the starting point for a trip to the world of arms trafficking, through the eyes of a trafficker who has surely killed more people than a nuclear bomb and who seems to live in a parallel reality. For him, the death of a child-soldier is sad, but its worse if its with arms purchased from the competition. All this shows us that this is a sarcastic movie, but with little drama and no characters that we can enjoy.As far as actors are concerned, the film is based on a good performance by Nicholas Cage, perhaps one of his best film performances to date. He is not one of the actors that I particularly like, so I was surprised to have liked his work here. The rest of the cast merely seeks to support him with poorly structured and developed characters. Jared Leto was a casting error."

They were so wrong.After a suberb opening, you are thrown into a day in the life of a cook-turned-gunrunner to give you an insight how the global gun trade works. Well probably not completely after the book but it does an outstanding job depicting the bloody tragedy of it. Especially the scene where he sits to the table in the african savannah dealing guns to the rebels, where he knows the villagers just a stonesthrow away will die with his bullets. Straight-A powerful projectory of the brutality of it.Fantastic characters, Cage has never done it better since this, Jared Leto plays his coked up brother great as well, and Ethan Hawke is the guy chasing Cage\u00b4s tail, also great.How can you rate this movie down? Those who read the title of the movie and expect Michael Bay trash, you are so in it for the wrong ride. This movie is about what takes place behind the action, behind the war, bloodshed and genocide in this world."

      "text": "Finally I've seen LORD OF WAR. I wanted to see it since it was released in France back in May. What a piece of trash! It lacks any dramatic credibility, its plot is incoherent (if there is one), its characters are one-dimensional, and its dialogs are tacky and stale. Syriana next to it is a major masterpiece! I don't know if I should do a review, since the film is so bad, it is beyond any serious attempt at reviewing. Just to say that the devil, as we know, is in details, and the details are not at all Niccol's strong point. [***SPOILERS***] There is no such a thing as Interpol agents (contrary to the popular myth perpetuated by Hollywood and Ethan Hawke) - Interpol is an information clearing house located in Lyon, France, staffed with international bureaucrats and directed by a former NYU law professor. Its employees have no legal powers to arrest anyone! Soviet (Ukrainian) Jews on Brighton Beach couldn't care less about Ukraine - the cradle of East European anti-Semitism (as Yuri Orlov's younger drug addict brother who nostalgically makes the map of Ukraine with the cocaine lines - tackier than that would only be the map of the US made with the lines of heroin by the film maker Niccol himself). Finally Orlov is not a Jewish name, contrary to what the main protagonist states in the beginning of the film. It is as Russian as Stoly vodka and Gorbachev's perestroika! In fact, Yuri Orlov is the name of a Soviet dissident, founder of the Moscow Helsinki group in the 1970s. Gun running may be a mortal sin, but spreading ignorance by making big-budget pretentious B-movies with Nikolas Cage is almost as bad. If anything, Cage deserves better than that! Post A Comment!"

The real stand-out performances for me are the father son duo of Liberia. Good production values.  My guess is this project had too little adult supervision at the script stage.

      "text": "\"Lord of War,\" a misfire of a political satire about the international gun market, opens with a killer scene: Nicolas Cage standing on a veritable carpet of bullet casings. Mr. Cage's character, Yuri Orlov, is a gunrunner who has placed untold weapons in untold numbers of hands. Now, surrounded by gutted buildings and dressed to impress, a cigarette burning between his fingers, Yuri looks straight into the camera and wonders aloud how he can furnish everyone in the world with a gun to call his very own.\r This carpet of casings also serves as a launching pad for a subsequent and even more outlandish opening credit sequence that tracks a bullet from its manufacture in Russia to its final resting place in the skull of a young African. A bullet in the head always seizes the imagination or at least the audience's attention, but because the African is merely cinematic collateral damage, the image registers both as showboating and as a warning shot for the problems to come. The screenwriter for \"Lord of War,\" Andrew Niccol, lavishes a great deal of time and many words building a case against guns; unfortunately, the film's director, who also happens to be Mr. Niccol, enjoys playing with toy guns. His words may say no, but his overworked, overslick visual style says lock and load, baby.\r The problem, of course, is that violence is so inherently cinematic, so visually and aurally captivating. Loud pops, big bangs and the sights and sounds of bodies seizing up and spurting blood have long been the stock in trade of certain movies, which partly explains why the bangs are getting ever louder, the bloodletting more spectacular. The noise in these films has grown so deafening that it can be hard to hear the message (if there even is one), especially when that message carries a familiar, been-there, done-that, eat-your-oatmeal-because-it's-good-for-you moralism. Like: guns are bad, corporations are soulless, and some first world governments traffic in third world misery. To which any reasonably informed viewer might be expected to wonder, And your point is what, exactly?\r Mr. Niccol's point here, it appears, is both to entertain and to instruct with the story of Yuri, a Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 who rises from humble Brooklyn to become a globe-trotting gunrunner with all the moral reasoning of a flea. Guided by Mr. Cage's intermittent voice-over, the story tracks Yuri's decades-long evolution as a merchant of death saddled with a few familiar distractions: a beautiful model wife played by Bridget Moynahan and a drug-addled brother played by Jared Leto.\r Yuri gets his break in the early 1990's when he snaps up materiel in the recently imploded Ukraine that he subsequently offloads in war-ravaged Africa. Like everything else in this film, Mr. Cage's performance is watchable if never credible because his director never resolves the disconnect between this star's function (to entertain) and that of his character (to repel)."

But to say that this movie \"doesn't have a single redeeming quality\"? It's an absurd, puerile statement that has nothing to do with this movie. Same goes for Dusty L., who says this is \"a slide show\" and to look elsewhere for action. Again, I have to wonder if he saw a different movie. Actually, if you like action, you'll be glad to know Lord of War has some terrific (admittedly usually brief) action, including an extraordinary sequence involving a plane making an emergency landing on a highway crowded with people, a truly jawdropping and thrilling scene. Other \"redeeming qualities\" this movie has: biting wit -- it's very funny; terrific editing; wonderful widescreen lensing with fantastic color and production design; strong performances from Cage, Leto, Holm, and many others; and great music.

I have not yet read a review that mentions the key distinction Lord of War makes between Yuri Orlov and Simeon Weisz, the two primary arms dealers shown here. Weisz (Ian Holm), who works with the CIA, says his aim is to change governments; he deals for a political purpose. Orlov (Nicolas Cage) does it because \"I'm good at it\" and he goes where the money is, not caring who gets the weapons. He also sells for the U.S. Government but, in addition, he makes his own deals, willy-nilly. Weisz believes his motivation is superior to Orlov's. Orlov challenges Weisz, reminding him that he (for the CIA) sold weapons to both Iran and Iraq (to use against each other). Weisz fires back that he wanted both of them to lose. There is no moral difference between these two men but their remarks about their own motivations provoke thoughts that ricochet against what we see happening in the world today. It's a thrilling insight and there are many like it in this shockingly (because it's in the multiplexes) profound view. Unfortunately many people will probably not understand exactly what they are seeing, and Lord of War may not get the recognition that it deserves. Jane Franklin."
