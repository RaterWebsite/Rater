As the caped crusader also deals with tortured memories of his parents' murder, he has a new romance, with psychologist Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman)."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I am still divided if this is a good movie or more in the so bad that it is good category. It might be both at the same time but I will not deny that it is entertaining and has some great moments but also some weaknesses. After Batman Returns missed Warner Bros. box office expectations and complains that it was too dark some changes were made for the next movie. I will say they made this one more colorful, used more humor and toned down the more matured parts. Actually I view this as a restart even if it is not a reboot. This time Batman has to deal with Two Face who was the former district attorney Harvey Dent. An acid attack left half of his face disfigured and drove him towards crime and insanity. He blames Batman for this as he could not stop this attack. Meanwhile scientist Edward Nygma who is a researcher at Wayne Enterprises has developed a new device that can beam television signals directly into a persons brain (Sidenote: This is actually more scary than most horror movies ever could be. Think of non stop commercials and this is the stuff of nightmares). However he is rejected by Bruce. Meanwhile a circus is in town and the acrobat Dick Grayson will experience something he never would have imagined. With this the story starts and I will stop here to avoid spoilers. The story works and is a vehicle for the action and characters. However it is neither that great nor reinventing the wheel. Batman the animated series did set up and use these characters far better and I think some of those episodes could be used for a better movie. To be fair it is also not bad and they know what they are doing. The characters are similar to the story. They work and are enjoyable but also they are not that great with some exceptions. Lets start with Batman aka Bruce Wayne played by Val Kilmer. Michael Keaton did not want to return so another actor has to fill the shoes. I think Val Kilmer would work great but is hold back by the script. Tommy Lee Jones does a fantastic job as Two Face and this deserves credit as with his costumes it is hard to take him serious (This could just be me to be fair). They miss a critical aspect of his character here. Two Face is Bruce Waynes greatest tragedy in a certain way. He could neither safe him as Batman nor as his good friend Bruce Wayne. However he still works. Jim Carrey as Edward Nygma is amazing. The role was made for him and his style. If you like his usual performance than everything is fine. If not than this is a disaster for you. I liked his performance and clearly see how much he enjoyed the role. Chris O\u2019Donnel as Dick Grayson delivers mostly a good performance but there are some scenes that are awful for his character. Then we have Nicole Kidman as Dr. Chase Meridan. Maybe too much damsel in distress but is really good otherwise. The rest of the cast gives a solid performance. I am divided here as we have good actors without a doubt. But I have seen those characters done better and the script harmed them too sometimes. Visually or presentation wise the movie has its own style. It looks familiar but more colorful. Some of the costume choices are bad and fail for me. The soundtrack by Eliot Goldenthal was really good. It had some songs that are still played today in the radio like \u201cKiss from a rose\u201d by seal and to a lesser content U2s \u201cHold me, thrill me, kiss me, kill me\u201d. Other than those I liked \u201cSmash it up\u201d by The Offspring and Methods Man \u201cThe Riddler\u201d. A good soundtrack and worth owning. Overall I like this movie but it will not end in my top movie lists. It is enjoyable but not awesome and I think a 7/10 is fair."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I can see why people don't like this (and obviously B&R) when compared to Burton's movies. But I honestly really enjoy this. Val is a good Batman, Tommy Lee Jones rocks as a bad guy & Nicole Kidman is stunning! I think the weak link is actually Jim Carrey, who I found far more annoying than I remember him being when I saw this as a kid.

Also, another positive I've got with this movie would have to be some of the camera work which is used for Batman (Val Kilmer) from it being in a fight scene or so on.

The plot is easier to follow but loses a lot of the emotion that is behind the character of Batman which in retrospect, was covered well in the first two films.

For example in the opening scene the film introduces Two Face, (Tommy Lee Jones) by showing how evil he is when he kills one of his own henchmen and tries to kill a cop. This opening scene also introduces Batman (Val Kimmer) as heroic because he saves the cop's life. Although I felt that the cop in this scene wasn't a very good actor. But the scene ends on a high note when Two Face escapes alive and this makes you wonder how Batman will stop him.\rThe film has quite a simple plot where Batman tries to stop the evil Two Face and his insane side kick, the Riddler. This simple plot stops the viewer from feeling lost and confused like they may do in a film with a complicated plot.Another example of the great way the film introduces characters is the scene where the Riddler (Jim Carrey) is introduced. The Riddler is introduced in a good way because when he writes his 1st riddle it fills the viewers mind with mystery and a sense of trying to figure it out before the end of the film. When Jim Carrey plays the Riddler the role is unique and makes you realize just how good an actor Jim Carrey really is because as well as playing a great comedian he can also play other roles. In this role\rThe special effects are also very good in a car chase scene where Two-Face's henchmen chase Batman in his bat mobile. In this scene the special effects make the driving stunts in the car chase seem very realistic.\rBut the action in this film can sometimes seem too violent which might shock the viewer because the film is only rated PG.\rOn the other hand the film does keep the viewer interested until the last scenes where Batman has to make a life changing decision and when the Riddler threatens to tell the whole world who Batman is.\rI would recommend this film to young adults and anyone who likes a good superhero film. I would rate the film 9/10."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "My favourite batman film proper entertainment just wished Kilmer stayed in the role for batman and robin."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "This film is just so stupid.

This film is enjoyable and directed beautifully and the villains are good besides Jim Carrey being a bit over the top at times.

Like, I was a DIEHARD fan for it. I idolized The Riddler, to the point that I kept drawing question marks on my bedroom wall with green crayons. I haven't watched the movie since then, and while growing up, I've heard so much **** about how crappy the Shumacher Batman films were, so my thoughts about this film have been negatively percepted since then.

It's no Nolan film, but it's really not as bad as people say it is.\r THE GOOD:\r-Val Kilmer's the best-looking Batman. He fits everything that has to be about Bruce Wayne and Batman.

Best part of the movie, hands down..\r-Bruce Wayne's past is explored a lot more.\r-Best-looking Batman costume.\rTHE BAD:\r-The script is GODAWFUL. NOTHING MAKES SENSE. Batman strongly talks Robin to not kill Two-Face as a form of revenge, but Batman himself kills Two-Face without any sensible explanation. Bruce Wayne giving up on being Batman.

The first scene with him was unbearable to watch.\r-Batnipples.\r-What the **** did Robin do the entire movie, esp. when Batman was in peril? He showed up only to get Batman out of the sand.

His character gets the most lines and screen time, with the Riddler essentially an extension of Carrey's comedy persona. His overbearing presence confines Two-Face (played by Tommy Lee Jones) into a secondary character, given no real personality of his own other than that of a glorified lackey. This movie is vibrant visually but lacks substance in terms of acting and writing."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Poor old Joel Schumacher - he'll be known for the rest of his life as \"The man who killed Batman\", though he earned that moniker in making Batman & Robin, not this installment. True, it's a very different take on the Dark Knight mythology from Tim Burton's previous brooding, Gothic adaptations - Schumacher adds a liberal dose of self-aware humour and in-jokes, and the whole film has a certain camp fun about it. It's almost like Batman and Batman Returns was the franchise in its moody teenage years, and all of a sudden it's decided to cheer up and have a little fun. Schumacher hasn't completely dumped Burton's ideas on the wayside though, and most likely due to Burton staying on as producer, the film continues to delve into Bruce Wayne's tragic past and complex psychology. These scenes could have been lifted directly out of either Batman or Batman Returns, and provide the film with a good emotional kick. Robin's origin story is also kept fairly dark and Burton-y, and the thematic parallels Schumacher and writer Akiva Goldsman draw between Dick Grayson and Bruce Wayne are dramatically effective. The casting for the film is a real mixed bag. Chris O'Donnell has the right rebellious attitude and confidence to play Robin, Nicole Kidman makes a feisty femme-fatale as sassy psychologist Chase Miridian, Michael Gough is reliable as always as Alfred, and Jim Carrey steals every scene he's in as a brilliantly batty Riddler. However, Val Kilmer is completely miscast as Batman, and even clever cinematography and editing can't hide the fact that he can't handle the stunts - he just looks fat and slow. The real turkey of the cast is, disappointingly, Tommy Lee Jones, who turns Harvey Two-Face, one of the most interesting and complex of Batman's rogues gallery into a simplistic, camp pantomime villain. We must also question some of the design changes in the film (nipples? why?) that are so jarringly different from Burton's mythos that they appear to not even belong on the same planet, never mind the same city. Gotham appears to have evolved at an alarmingly rapid rate from a city of seedy slums and gothic cathedrals to a very East Asian-inspired neon metropolis. Well at least the taxes from the hard-working citizens of Gotham appear to have been put to good use. Batman Forever is an incredibly uneven film. There are good performances (Carrey), bad performances (Kilmer) and ugly performances (Jones). Batman's back-story is further fleshed out in dark flashbacks, and the introduction of Robin is handled well, but there's also homo-erotic suiting-up montages and bat-nipples. The film as a whole looks expensive, in a top-of-the-line fairground attraction sort of way, but it lacks finesse, and consistency in tone. It's clearly not the best Batman film, but Forever is also by-no-means the worst (audiences would have to wait another two years for the franchise-killer). One thing I will say for Joel Schumacher's first foray into the Batman universe - it's inconsistent, certainly, but it's never boring!"}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Suffering the \"threequel effect\" from beginning to end, BATMAN FOREVER is a tedious superhero movie. It now stars Val Kilmer as the titular character, a less believable Batman than even Michael Keaton, who was a hard one to take into mind. And along with the whole superficiality of the plot, the villains aren't all that great either. The three previous villains were the Joker (Jack Nicholson), Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), and Penguin (Danny DeVito). Now, we have another duo, consisting of the Riddler (Jim Carrey) and Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones). Unlike in BATMAN and BATMAN RETURNS, these villains are more silly and ridiculous than creepy. Just look at the DVD box--their outfits give away all the asininity. Should you see this? I wouldn't recommend it. If you do, will you like it? It depends if you can stand Jim Carrey in more than just comedy and drama."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Alot of people hate this movie but i really like it.
