      "text": "For those who have lost track of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise, here's the deal with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning: It's a prequel to the 2003 remake The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, not a prequel to Tobe Hooper's original 1974 The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. And it has no connection with Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation, starring Matthew McConaughey and Ren\u00e9e Zellweger before they knew better. Got it? Okay. Here's everything else you need to know about The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning: It's really gory and really dull. Mostly just dull. And it's far worse than a cash-in prequel to a mercenary Texas Chainsaw Massacre sequel has any right to be.\r Hooper's film has a blood-drenched reputation, but it built its scares out of skillfully crafted suspense. Like its 2003 predecessor, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning relies on made-you-jump shocks and more fake entrails than a Jaycees haunted house. It wastes no time in getting to either, but it's still a tremendous waste of time.\r In drill-sergeant mode, as always, character actor R. Lee Ermey returns as the patriarch of an inbred, cannibalistic Texas clan which, this time out, terrorizes two attractive, unfortunate couples. The male half of one (Matthew Bomer) is on his way to re-enlist for service in Vietnam, not knowing that his brother (Taylor Handley) plans to dodge the draft in Mexico. That whole question quickly becomes moot once Ermey and his adopted, leather-faced \"nephew\" start chopping them up one by one, a process that sadly takes up much of the movie.\r There's a lot to dislike about TTCM: TB, beginning with the fact that it repeats whole scenes from its immediate predecessor. They didn't work that well the first time around, and they aren't improved here. Really, the film is only worth considering as part of a trend of films that seem to exist to show audiences what torture looks like in graphic detail, almost as if torture had become some kind of national anxiety. But that couldn't be the case, could it?"

This was not in the least scary. Covering my eyes was my way of protecting my dinner and maintaining it in my stomach. A waste of time, money, and brain cells. Disgusting."

The original was so great because it was terrifying without being gruesome. It also stayed close to the truth. But this movie is the exact opposite. It's a ridiculously gory and a ridiculously absurb movie. So, what do you get? Another horrible slasher film. What should you do to escape this movie? Rent the original or get it off eBay. But unless you REALLY want to see someone get their face cut off, run. And fast."

      "text": "Those hoping for any sort of nuanced exploration into what caused the Hewitt family to become so depraved will be disappointed. This origin story has only the briefest mention of some P.O.W. related trauma so Leatherface and his relatives are just depicted as psychos from the get-go. We see how they got their start at butchering random travellers though and with plenty of little revelations about stuff from the 2003 film (like how Sheriff Hoyt lost his front teeth). However, it's not like anyone is looking for any real depth here anyways. We're here to see people get killed and on that front the movie delivers in grotesquely satisfying ways.The opening birthing sequence feels like something straight out of an exploitation flick. In fact the whole thing is so much more grindhouse than its predecessor that I imagine it will have a hard time appealing to the more mainstream horror audience. The increased amount of torture and nastiness have definite hardcore appeal. The real improvement are found in the pacing though. There's not a moment of downtime on the way to the incredibly bleak ending and that makes a lot of difference.There's no depth or any reason to care about anybody onscreen, but if you enjoy occasionally trekking through the muck and mire this entrail laden journey can provide a good time. If you have a strong stomach that is. Proof that even if your movie is sadistic, it doesn't have to be miserable to watch. At least not from an entertainment standpoint.7.9/10"

      "text": "TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE takes a step back in time to reveal the origins of the infamous Hewitt family in TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE: THE BEGINNING. A deformed child is rescued and raised by a penniless family out in the sticks of Texas, a family that is forced into cannibalism when the local slaughterhouse is put out of business. Unfortunately for a group of travelers who are on their way to Austin to enlist for Vietnam, this means that they are the next item on the menu! For the most part, THE BEGINNING keeps up with the remake that preceded it, but as a prequel it falls into many unavoidable traps. The filmmakers feel obliged to as many questions as possible in only a limited amount of time, which leads to a number of plot contrivances. Here, we learn where Thomas Hewitt got his saw, why Hoyt became the sheriff, how Uncle Monty lost his legs, and where Leatherface got his nickname... All in the same night! For a family whose killing spree lasted over four years, this just seems forced. The political weight of Vietnam is also heavier load than the film can bear, and comes off as being ignorant and ungenuine. THE BEGINNING is the bloodiest of any of the CHAINSAW films, however, with many graphic and gory murder scenes. A decent follow up, and still one of the better sequels. -Carl Manes\rI Like Horror Movies"

Not sure if it was because most of the female audience members screamed and I wasn't ready or I was actually scared in some parts. What truly made this a good movie for me is that one final scare. When you see it, you may debate the formulated value of it and yes, you may even say it is predictable, but it's just that ONE moment that it happens that catches you off guard. One of the other things I liked about this version is that there was no reservations on the gore factor. My suggestion is do not see this on a full stomach if it is weak because it is a bloodbath at some points, but all in all it was a fun way to pass a couple of hours!!"

There is absolutely no point to this derivative prequel. If the film's intent is to tell the story of Leatherface's origin, it clearly has nothing new to say. You won't learn any special insights into the mind of this assembly line serial killer that you haven't already been bludgeoned over the head with in previous installments. 'The Beginning' is very gory, but never scary. In fact, the Hewitt family isn't perversely fascinating and tantalizingly maniacal like the best screen villians should be. Frankly, I just found them annoying and grating. The death scenes are sufficiently grisly to please fans of ultragore, and there is yet another twisted dinner scene, but the film is utterly forgettable. By the end, you will most assuredly be praying that Leatherface's chainsaw FINALLY runs out of gas. God knows this series did ages ago!"
