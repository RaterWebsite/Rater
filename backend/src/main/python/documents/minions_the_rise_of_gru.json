Overall, Minions: The Rise Of Gru is a massive improvement over it\u2019s 2015 predecessor and the best film in the franchise since Despicable Me 2 and If you want to simply have fun if you\u2019re feeling down, I think this film will help cheer you up."

There are very few criticisms i have of this movie and would probably have to watch it again in cinema in order to find the smallest misconceptions in the movie, which is probably gru's weapon not malfuncioning which is incredibly minor. I must say this move is a must watch, I'm not even saying this as a joke or a meme you must watch this its a breathtaking experience. Easily a 10/10"

      "text": "E-Value: 8Acting: 8Plot: 7The story of the Minions\u2019 past continue in this instalment where they are join by their current boss which they later continue serving him in the future Despicable Me instalments, Felonius Gru (Carell).Seven years after the events of the first movie, the Minions (Coffin) have been serving Gru as their loyal minions to help him achieve his dream of becoming a supervillain. One day, Gru receives an audition invitation to join a supervillain team called Vicious 6 which is now lead by Bella Bottom (P. Henson), after the death of the team\u2019s founder, Wild Knuckles.Gru attends the audition but the outcome is very poor because the Vicious 6 look down on him for being a child. Eager to prove himself and them wrong, Gru steals the Zodiac Stone which the Vicious 6 stole it years ago during a heist. As he is being chased by the Vicious 6, Gru gives the stone to Otto, one of the Minions, and they will meet back at his hideout while he along with the other Minions: Kevin, Stuart and Bob distract them.Back in the hideout, Gru and the other Minions are furious to find out that Otto has trade away the Zodiac Stone for a pet rock with some random kid at a birthday party. To make matter worse, the stone is now under the hands of kid\u2019s uncle, who is now on route to San Francisco. Gru goes after the stone while elsewhere, there is another person who wants the Zodiac Stone as well besides the Vicious 6.Compare to the first Minions movie, this movie improved in many ways. For one, the movie not only focus on the Minions as the main protagonist but also include Gru in the role as well. In addition, this movie feels much closer to a Despicable Me movie. Neither the Minions nor Gru steals the spotlight each other throughout the movie. Gru has a great character developments in this movie and his interactions with the Minions is still heartwarming to watch on big screen. The humours in this movie is much better and improved than the previous movie.In terms of animation, Illumination still have done great job in that department and suffer no downfall. The casts have done a great in the voice acting as well especially Steve Carell, who still retains the charm of voicing Gru. Let\u2019s not forget about Pierre Coffin, who once again did a great job in voicing all the Minions. The plot of the movie is fine and easy enough to follow without any complications.Despite the improvement from the first movie, this movie have major mistakes. First, there is a continuity error in this movie. Gru is said to be an eleven years old boy in this movie but he still looks the same like he was at the end of the first movie with no sign of aging at all. Next, the other members of Vicious 6 are generally flat characters and generic henchmen. Not only they do not have many lines but they are all voiced by well-known celebrity actors. This is really a waste of their talents in such a small role. The studios should have gone with lesser known actors instead of hiring celebrity actors.Nevertheless, the movie is still fun to watch. Kids will definitely enjoy this movie. You can bring you kids to watch this movie on the weekends. Even if you are not a kid but have watch all Despicable Me movies, you should definitely catch this one."

      "text": "While I'm not a fan of Illumination and their many bad movies, The Minions franchise is always an exception from me. Something about the movies feels nostalgic and funny, and not a waste of two hours of my life. I wasn't a fan of the first Minions movie, so I wasn't interested in this one at all. The Rise of Gru is much better though, as it features more Gru and it's not just all Minions. The story is pretty good, but it has some plotholes. Then again it's an Illumination movie, plotholes are bound. There's a lot of fun parts in the story that are just super weird, but really good. The animation is a massive highlight in my opinion, it looks SO fresh and clean. The characters look creative and different, and it plays the idea of the mid 70s very well with costumes and songs. The soundtrack is good, but it's nothing to write home about other then some pop culture references in songs and the medley playing every now and then. Honestly the action is a pretty good highlight of this movie, the fight scenes for some reason are pretty entertaining. My only flaws are the pretty solid-sized plotholes, the McGuffin not being used much, and the comedy isn't too good at times. But this is enjoyable for people who like the Minions franchise and for kids. Highlight is definitely the animation and the callbacks and references to previous films. I'd go see this movie, the hype for it and memes from it are golden."

Because, as it stands now, this was just not my thing. From the inconsequential and disjointed storytelling, to the elementary jokes, I honestly found myself treasuring the fact that this thing was under 90 minutes. That isn't to say you're less of a person or filmgoer for enjoying this. If anything, the fact that movies like this are enjoyed by so many and disliked by far less is a testament to the prevailing element of subjectivity in this art form. I look at a scene involving the titular characters absolutely butchering the Rolling Stones's \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" as an affront to the ears, while others regard it with jollity. That's life. Either way, there's no end in sight for these films. The powers-that-be will keep making them and I suppose I'll keep giving them a shot. Didn't work out for me this time, however."

      "text": "The Minions have the problem that their fame after their appearance in Despicable Me forced them to be over-exploited.They were precisely what their name meant. They were funny, colourful, flashy characters and became one of the standout elements of the film, while it was understood that they were just comic relief.2015's Minions proved they couldn't sustain a whole film and now with The Rise of Gru, which could basically be called Despicable Me 0.5, they fix that issue with Gru's addition because he represents someone at the centre of the narrative taking the lead.What follows is more of the same. A formula that doesn't dare to change anything and not that it needs to because, despite its flaws, Illumination Entertainment seems to know who they are making this film for.The animation is impeccable and the humor will work more than well for its target audience.Because that needs to be emphasised to the professional critics who think the characters should have given more for the older audience.And it's not about treating kids like idiots with silly jokes, but this is still a kids' film, and they just want to have a good time with characters they have fun with, and Minions: The Rise of Gru delivers in that regard.My 4-year-old niece was the best proof of that.If you're over the age of 10 and you were expecting something more transcendental from characters who just talk gibberish and have a childlike behavior, that's a problem of your own expectations."

There isn\u2019t a ton to say about this movie as it\u2019s a stereotypical Illumination movie. Animation is weird, voice acting is fine, humor isn\u2019t that funny, and feels like like a cash grab which a decent majority of this film feels like. This is one of the \u201cbetter\u201d movies that Illumination has put out though. There are some moments here where the film is actually kind of funny. The airplane stuff would work as a fun short film if they released that on its own. The film got a ton more unintentional laughs out of me though. I was laughing at how stupid the film was which definitely wasn\u2019t the intention of the studio but it definitely did make the film much more enjoyable that way. Its got some fun moments sprinkled ever so sparingly thrown out but it\u2019s not worth watching the whole thing for it as when the film isn\u2019t on the minions then it\u2019s dreadful. I don\u2019t care about Gru or the villains at all and their dynamic is incredibly weak and Alan Arkin\u2019s voice acting for Wild Knuckles is dreadful. The story itself is incredibly boring as well but thankfully the somewhat funny moments here and there don\u2019t make it a chore to sit through. Plus the film is short anyway so it won\u2019t feel too long. If you really want to watch this film then definitely watch it with friends as it will be 100 times more fun watching it that way than watching it by yourself."
