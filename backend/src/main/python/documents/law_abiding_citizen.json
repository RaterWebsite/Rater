The scene where Clyde is in court and argues with the judge is a great example of this - he uses the system itself to prove his argument, and shows that the law needs to be changed for true justice to be served.Then the second half of the movie comes along, and Clyde's character shifts from an intelligent citizen  to a complete psychopath. All that was clever about this film turns into a mindless bloody mess. By the end I was left wondering what had happened."

Some compared it to the disgusting series \"Saw\" or \"Torture Porn\", they couldn't be more wrong, there is honestly not very much gore in the movie at all except for two quick scenes. Granted some disgusting things are implied throughout the movie to add to its emotion and intensity and it does succeed.\r Gerard Butler plays a fantastic role as a villain (possibly the only better bad guy I've seen is \"The Joker\" from \"The Dark Knight\".) Jaime Fox plays the good guy and his performance is descent.\r Like others have stated the ending is one of those \"really? come on now?\" moments but that is when you have to say to yourself \"it's just a movie.\"\r If you're looking for a good crime thriller on a late Friday night, this is a perfect pick."

      "text": "Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx play the lead roles in Law Abiding Citizen, a brutal thriller in which a father and husband (Butler) makes an example of the legal system that wronged him.Jamie Foxx plays the prosecutor who makes a plea deal with the man who killed Butler's wife and child. In exacting payback on an attorney for his previous decisions, the film is similar to Cape Fear but LAC actually shares more in common with Saw as Butler cleverly butchers his way through the cast.LAC begins in an interesting manner and tries to argue the case for both flawed sides of the justice system. However, once Butler lands himself in jail and puts his plan into effect this balanced view disappears and is replaced by a violent killing spree. Butler's logic seems confused as he vehemently denies that his actions are revenge, but by killing everyone close to his case, I struggle to see what else they could be described as. Mass murder of the local justice system seems overkill for ensuring that lessons are learnt. The film will no doubt promote some discussion as to the point at which Butler's character's actions become unjustified and he transgresses from the film's hero to ruthless villain.Butler outshines Foxx, initially as the troubled father and husband with a cause to fight before his descent into his role as psychopathic murderer.Law Abiding Citizen had the potential to be a cat and mouse thriller with a conscience but is ultimately just a reasonably decent thriller, but one lacking the clever twists and intelligent ending of Saw."

However, as the movie progressed, the good guy most deserving of getting his revenge went way over the top, morphing from a greiving father and husband into the killer-clown from \"Saw\". At the same time the plot morphed from being mostly believable to totally preposterous. By the time of the movies climax, I had pretty much lost interest and felt cheated out of a movie that could have and should have been much better."

      "text": "Among things most moviegoers don't want to see, a small girl being murdered during a home invasion would surely be close to topping the list, especially if the child makes bracelets that spell out \"daddy\" for her proud papa. Since \"Law Abiding Citizen\" turns out to be \"Clyde: Portrait of a Serial Killer(or \"Clean Shaven Death Wish), in which the daddy-turned-vigilante(played by Gerald Butler) starts killing, not NYC lowlifes like a Scottish Charles Bronson, but innocent people, ala Henry(Michael Rooker) in the 1989 John McNaughton film, brutality needs to match brutality, because the cause and effect of the carnage needs to be better proportioned. Our reaction to a decollated head, or a woman in car being blown up to smithereens, is more visceral, and far outweighs an abstract murder that took place beyond the fade-out, when it comes to impacting the audience, who needs to sympathize with Clyde's loss during his self-righteous killing spree. Not nearly enough time is spent on establishing Clyde as a husband and father. The filmmaker cuts to the chase, mere minutes into \"Law Abiding Citizen\", so, impassioned speech with his lawyer Nick(Jamie Foxx) about justice notwithstanding, the film largely pre-supposes Clyde's family man integrity as a given. In most cases, flashbacks often do nothing for a film, except oversell the protagonist's loss with affected sentimentality, in a scene that depicts happier times, where the grieving spouse gets all red-eyed after waking up from a reverie. This time around, it would help \"Law Abiding Citizen\", if Clyde displayed some sign of humanity, since the fallout from his vengeance is so distortedly pronounced, the film's message about a broken judicial system gets lost in the arterial spray."

It really started out strong and made me excited for what would happen next, but then it gets too ahead of itself. The first 40 minutes of the movie are the best and then the last hour sort of drags on. I enjoyed Jamie Foxx's role but I don't understand why he is so involved in the story when he is a lawyer. He shouldn't have anything to do with most of the events in the movie. I understand he is there in order to make the movie more intense but it sacrifices realism. He should have been a cop. Then ending was sort of good but semi-predictable. I didn't think that this movie is really bad I just found a lot of things flawed with it. I'm sure many people would still enjoy the film. Just don't think too hard about it."

He is a great anti-hero/mastermind actor. A similar movie to Law Abiding Citizen with a lead character being a dark mastermind is Inside Man. Gerard Butler stars in it, too!\r However, i was very let down with the ending to this movie. Despite as sinister as it sounds, it would have been amazing to see Clyde's plan workout in the end. I feel it would have given a better remembrance to his name, and his motive. The tip that Nick received at the end was very disappointing; to have Clyde's plan spoiled by a tip was just sad.\r The movie is very underrated. Great plot, exceptional acting, and disappointing ending. To be fair, though, i could see many people content with the way the movie ended. Probably in my top 20 list of movies. 6/10."

Well directed and scored, it's unfortunately let down by a poorly written script and (apart from Gerard Butler) a cast on auto-pilot.\r The premise is interesting enough, but it's how it is presented that fails. Too much that is obvious, is overtly obvious, and the little bits which are 'filled in' as the film continues just feel like the tired cliches of 'i know a guy' who then provides the necessary information for the good guys to finally come good.\r Jamie Foxx's performance is woeful, he lacks the dynamic emotional range to convey the struggle of a man who is losing everything he holds dear who, despite his claims of intelligence and integrity, has no idea how these acts are being accomplished.\rHis almost deadpan delivery only makes the audience want the bad guy to succeed, and when he is ultimately foiled, it's not a win for the good guys... It's just feels like an absolute cop out, especially as there's no epilogue to show if anything about the 'system' has changed.\r However, it's not a bad movie. The central performance of Butler redeems it a great deal and, if you like action and violence mixed in with a fairly intelligent plot, you won't be disappointed.\rBut, if you're looking for someone that possesses the dialogue and performances to match, then one to avoid."

It is a very clever movie that has a very clear and loud message \"Everyone has to take responsibility for their actions.\" Nick played by Jamie Foxx was too concerned about his status and was focused on achieving a high conviction rate so cut deals for criminals that should be locked up for a very long time. Clyde was an innocent guy who lost his family and I can understand some people saying the good guy Clyde went way over the top to become the bad guy toward the end of the movie but I can understand why he went over the top because if you remember, Nick told Clyde at the beginning of the movie that he already finished the deal without even asking or considering Clyde's opinion. The guy lost his family and had his feet cut out from beneath him when Nick finished a deal. This is one of the best movies I've seen and it's very clever and has an important message. I'm from a different country, I wasn't born here in the United States, and I have read and witnessed about cases like these occuring often where justice is not correctly served and criminals escape day after day in my home country so maybe that's why I appreciate this movie more than others because to me, this movie is a partially a true story in some sense."

It's a shame really because the performances aren't bad, Butler plays light and dark well with Jamie Foxx actually being a perfect foil for him as the straight laced realist. They play well off each other and dialogue wise, the script is pretty good so some scenes are thoroughly entertaining at least aesthetically. The problem is that the final product is so remarkably empty you can't look back on the things you like and leave the viewing with a positive reaction. It's a film trying to make some kind of a point but all you really get is a dark, gritty thriller that is void of substance. It doesn't help that the last 40 minutes move the film from gritty, character drama to cliche filled farce with a final twist so remarkably stupid it just ruins it further."

It's technically competent throughout and with the addition of a serviceable script the film should be an intelligent and memorable thriller providing an insightful critique on law and morality. Somehow though, Law Abiding CItizen never rises above mediocrity, and is a largely forgettable affair. After an exciting initial setup, the narrative plods and becomes utterly ridiculous towards the final act, which is so over-the-top it wouldn't look out of place in a 70s disaster movie. Characterisation is also inconsistent, with Foxx's heavily moralistic and by-the-book lawyer conveniently able to bypass his long-held convictions when it suits the story. In addition, though he makes a decent enough anti-hero throughout, Butler does occasionally slip back into his natural Scottish dialect during the more intense and demanding scenes. Law Abiding Citizen only just manages to stay afloat thanks to director F. Gary Gray's craftsmenship and the talent of the lead performers. It falls utterly flat in other areas, however, because of misjudgements of tone, uneven pacing and a critical lack of commitment to the big ideas behind the film. The film is passable, but nothing more."
