This movie starts out promising but then falls apart completely by the end. The main problem with the movie is that the monster has no purpose what-so-ever in the story and the film would have been great if it was just about the father son trying to find peace after the death of the mother in addition to the son coming of age with the girl and his friends by shooting a super 8 movie. That part of the movie is good, then the monster appears and not only destroys half of the town, but it goes one step further and destroys the film too. The monster is just stupid; it's not interesting and there's really nothing in the storyline of the monster that hasn't been done before. It's basically bits and pieces of other - better - movies that have already been released.  The movie falls apart because for almost 3/4 of the film the monster is just background noise between the scene of the boy and girl, and his friends, all of which are interesting.  Then at the end of the film these stories are abandoned completely and the monster's story - which sucks - is wrapped up in to a cgi blastoff which ends the film.\r Let's recap:\r Father and Son grieving after loss of the mother, the father is distant from his son. Climax: Father and Son hug at the end of the film. No talking about all of the previous stuff, just a hug.\r Son & Girl(friend) awkward relationship that blossoms in to...\rClimax: nothing...\r Monster & Military -  The monster is captured, tortured and then escapes but not after killing innocent people and then being helped to escape by the kids who are scared to death of it the entire film, but then suddenly decide to help it. Which escapes in a space ship which it builds out of regular everyday items from 1979 which some how selectively magnetize themselves to the watertower (never explained, it sounds ridiculous writing this out) and then can summons thousands of minature cubs in to a ship which just suddenly appears for no reason.  There is never an explanation as to how the monster suddently fixes his ship at the end. T\r Super 8 Movie - The kids are shooting this zombie film the entire god damn movie and it just becomes irrelevant at the end. You would think they would at least play the final cut during the credits or something, but no... nothing.\r Group of friends:  The entire movie the son is running around with his four friends but at the end each ot these friends gets cut from the ending, there is no closure on any of their stories."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Closer to \"Goonies\" than to \"E.T.\".  I enjoyed this movie but in watching it, even though there is a sense of wonder and nostalgia that is generally missing in movies these days, you realize quickly how rare a talent Steven Spielberg is.  Here is what Spielberg did right and some of what is lacking in \"Super 8\".  First, the villain is not flushed out.  In E.T., the villain really isn't a villain except in the eyes of the protagonists.  \"Keys\" as he is known in E.T. believed what he was doing was for the greater good.  He longed for an experience like Elliot.  Unfortunately, he failed to see what the children saw all along, that E.T. was a living being with his own needs and desires.  In \"Super 8\", the villainous Nelec was completely two dimensional and malevolent.  The story would have been stronger had the motives been clear for his behavior and especially if his judgment was complex \u00e2"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I'm really glad that I watched Super 8. It had a really interesting plot with surprisingly good acting by the young kids. The sci-fi mixed with horror worked well.

Overall though, it was definitely very entertaining, felt original and fresh, and had good acting and development."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Though it wasn't much of a movie to watch with friends, it still had some pretty cool scenes. watching this with family though would be much more suitable as it accomplishes that sense of loss while maintaining a sense of adventure."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Super 8 was visually stunning, well acted, and a lot of fun as well as well written for the first hour and 35 minutes or so.

The film's more about relationships, growing up, and dealing with bereavement than about a creature's rampage through small-town America. The young cast are great, all delivering engaging, but natural performances. J J Abrams really couldn't have made it any clearer that he loves Spielberg, everything from the setting, to the cinematography and mise-en-scene could have come from late 70s/early 80s Spielberg films. Maybe you could criticise Abrams for being too Spielbergian and having few ideas of his own, but he does undoubtedly put his own mark on the film, once again demonstrating his skill as a character-focused storyteller. After the emotional first act and sensationally realised train crash, the plot does drag a little, and evil army officials seem a little too cliched to make particularly compelling antagonists (though using them does nod to E.T.) The creature itself is also not particularly memorable, but as already stated, Super 8 isn't about the monster, but about people. A very entertaining ride overall, just make sure you sit through the credits!"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This movie is all character development. by the end of the film you are so attached to the characters you don't want the movie to end.

On the one hand, Super 8 (Directed by JJ Abrams) is so engrossing as a window into a mourning town but it also tells a thrilling coming of age tale because of its extremely talented group of actors. Elle Fanning's character is like an onion, with so many layers to her character helping the viewer to feel with her, that when you are finished peeling you are crying like a baby.  Sure there is a science fiction element that harks back to Spielberg but its execution is to embrace what made those films so imaginative and use it to improve the experience, embracing the sense of wonder that Spielberg film did. The ending is the major payoff with a beautiful finale with an awe inspiring set piece, rousing music and a great sense of forgiveness and amazement."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "There are moments of genius, spectacle and visually stunning set pieces that deserve nothing but admiration for the scope and vision of J.J. Abrams in his highly secretive 'Super 8', a film that has flashes of of the science fiction favourites we came to love, E.T. being the one that comes to mind. Its a homage of sorts that messes with the things that go bump in the night scenario, but adds in a pack of excellent performances from a child cast that push the film to be character-driven piece, where the actors make the film. Joel Courtney makes a commanding debut as the young kid Joel, who helps his friends film near a train station, where they witness a massive train crash which isn't everything it seems to be.\rAs the rest of their town suffer the repercussions of this irregular crash, Joel and his friends wonder what exactly happened and why the strange anomalies that occur afterwards are in place. From start to finish its clear the eye that Abrams has for detail and awe, his nostalgic bows to the Spielberg era of science-fiction aren't subtle, with various nods here and their to plot devices used in the past by Spielberg, such similarities that lead to an ending which feels very forced and typical to suit those who remember those films of the past, while there is emotional depth to the final moments, it just happened too quickly.\rThe redeeming feature of the extra-terrestrial adventure is the \"precious cargo\" itself, something we rarely see throughout the film, but we have the feeling it is there, through clever uses of editing and the panic on its unfortunate victims. The train mentioned earlier is one of the best highlights and most impressive feats of the film, with an added dose of miraculous explosions to pay homage to the films of yesteryear. But these feats couldn't be truly accomplished with the impressive turns of the relatively young cast, who show true quality and bring real depth and charisma to their performances, much like The Goonies, they have their own traits and personalities that contribute towards their group.\rA masterful piece of filmmaking that takes off running but ultimately begins to unravel as the closing moments are rushed and forced to be accepted, but excellent performances and some stunning visuals make Super 8 and unmissable and nostalgic trip."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Full of wonder, excitement, feeling, tension, first love, doing the right thing, opposing our parents and everything that goes with the imagination we had as children.

The start of the plot is very attractive and has a mysterious aura that surrounds it; and this feeling of understanding nothing gives the movie an expressionist atmosphere. So is a challenge to solve the problem and connect all the clues. Among the details are reveled, you start perceiving a huge conflict that involves the humankind, worthy of the greatest masters of cinema. This wide situation never stops caring about little human issues; in Super 8 the children are anxious to create a short film, no mattering what they have to do and when the accident occur they take it as a production value, totally delightful.All of the above suggest an epic ending, but there was no way that J.J.

This adult (ok old man), thinks this is more along the lines of \"Goonies\" - yes, that other classic, sprinkled with more thrill/suspense.  Excellent mix of action and comedy - never cheesy nor \"forced\" - something most more \"mature\" films should learn how to do - I think we've all suffered through one or two lines in some movie that just try \"too hard\".Unsure what the \"kid meter\" for this film is.

The early 80's were recreated so well in the towns and homes of a small Ohio town. You really start to believe in the recreation of the time period which pulls you further into the story.

Abrams being branded on every trailer and poster I simply had to give it a shot. And I was really glad I did because it was very very good. It was really a tribute to the movies of the late 20th century wasn't it? It had all the elements of Spielberg's classic E.T. with a close group of friends on bicycles riding about town shooting scenes for a movie with \"production value\", adults who seem to be one step behind the kids on the whole mystery, the government intervention and of course an extraterrestrial being \"trying to go home\". The special effects were great, especially the train crash. Very breathtaking stuff. But even with all the amazing effects and all the action going around, we never really forget the emotional side of it all, Abrams never let's the action upstage the human aspect of the story. Joe who recently lost his mother to a violent tragedy lives with his grief-stricken, depressed and distant father begins to bond with Alice in an 8mm film production of zombies, she herself has father issues. Their relationship reminds me a bit of Abby and Owen in Let Me In united by their own little tragedies, finding solace in each other. Elle Fanning and Joel Courtney play their roles exceptionally well, amazing since it's their first time in a major movie. It was really refreshing to finally watch a movie which was not rushed through production (yeah I'm looking at you X-Men), very carefully thought out and which really took it's own time to tell the story that it wants to tell. I wasn't born in the 60s or 70s but watching Super 8 made me feel like I was in that period of time of filmmaking, it felt very authentic. The closing credits was awesome."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "The word that kept floating to the surface as I was driving home from the theater was authentic.  I'd probably score the basic story and plot framework a \"7\", but the movie does such an incredible job bringing me back to the late 70's, and the kids are so spot-on perfect in their roles, that it became an easy 8, almost a 9. Most kids in movies are nothing like the kids I knew when I was young, but Abrams (and the casting director) nailed them in Super 8.  Yes, it has that E.T./Goonies irreverent feel to it, but without these kids, the movie falls apart. Kyle Chandler, Ron Eldard, and the other adults are also extremely well-cast.  Chandler - the acting Sheriff - is a tough father still grappling with the loss of his wife (who is also amazing in a brief snippet), and Abrams doesn't soft-shoe his relationship with his son.  Elle Fanning is terrific - a star in the making.  It's only the basic story that is the weak part of the film - and that may sound more damning than I mean it to me.  As soon as I heard ELO's \"Don't Bring Me Down\" (embarrassingly my favorite song for like 3 years of my youth) open the film, I was transported back to that time and place, and it just worked. Don't want to spoil anything further - it's worth seeing. Considering that my midnight show was only half-full, I'm skeptical that it'll have a huge opening weekend. I'm just hoping that some of the Potter/Twilight/Hunger Games kids will turn out for it - though the pre-cellphone, net, ipod days of the late 70s might be tough to relate to."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This film has more heart than any film could ever wish for.

He does a phenomal job with the action and visuals, but knows to push those in the the background so the characters, story, and emotion are the main focus. Surprisingly, the kids were my favorite part of the movie. They were great, funny, and did a great job with the emotional scenes. My favorites would have to be Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning. The suspense JJ Abrams creates, especially in the last 1/2 hour, is so intense to the point where I could've had a heart attack.

Certain elements of the story seemed completely unnecessary, such as the white cubes, the rivalry between the fathers, and the protagonist's mother's locket.

It was very well written, shot, and directed. J.J. Abrams did a great job here. The casting was great, each child actor was charming in their own way. Yeah, it can appeal to a younger audience, but it also appeals to the older ones as well. Makes them reminisce their childhood. Not from the aspect of aliens and such, but the imagination that they once had as a child, and how things felt so simple. How they coped with a loss of a family member, or anything important to them. This movie is a metaphor and should be looked at that way. Although, if you don't feel like thinking, sit back, enjoy the story and the CGI. A great movie and definitely going to be a top 10 for summer movies this year."}], "recommendations": ["bumblebee", "tomorrowland", "avengers_age_of_ultron", "incredibles_2", "9", "edge_of_tomorrow", "a_quiet_place_part_ii", "the_5th_wave", "inception", "the_13th_warrior", "how_to_train_your_dragon_2", "hanna", "the_kid_who_would_be_king", "pan", "hugo", "the_chronicles_of_narnia_the_voyage_of_the_dawn_treader", "the_bfg", "the_last_witch_hunter", "doctor_strange", "what_happened_to_monday", "transformers_dark_of_the_moon", "fantastic_beasts_the_crimes_of_grindelwald", "it", "zathura_a_space_adventure", "oblivion"]}
