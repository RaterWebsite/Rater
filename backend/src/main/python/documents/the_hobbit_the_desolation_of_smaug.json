      "text": "\"Decent fantasy-action slightly inspired by The Hobbit\"\rMost reviews will tell you what's so great about this movie and why it's worth watching, but I figured you should hear the other side of the story.\r First of all a small note for Tolkien fans. If you thought An Unexpected Journey strayed a bit too far from the book: The Desolation of Smaug looks like the script writers didn't even know there was a book. The movie tries hard to change the story wherever it can, reducing fan-favorite chapters to 5 minute scenes and writing new content that feels out of place.\r But it's not only bad if you've read the book. I really wonder what the target audience is, because it feels like it's written for 15 year old boys. There are random action scenes every 10 minutes and 'funny' decapitations every 30. The worst thing here is that the action comes at the cost of character development. You have a band of 13 Dwarfs and a Hobbit, yet you rarely see them interact.\r Now I like Elves more than Dwarfs, so I didn't mind seeing so much of them in this movie. But having them show up in every place to save the day feels wrong. Perhaps Peter Jackson thought his cast of Dwarfs wasn't good enough to create an enjoyable movie? Gandalf's scenes in Dol Guldur were an interesting addition in concept, but they are just too slow. I feel his scenes mostly serve as an attempt to raise The Hobbit to The Lord of the Rings' level of epicness. And that just doesn't work.\r The story is full of illogicalities. How does entering the mountain to steal the Arkenstone to unite the Dwarfs to kill the Dragon to enter the mountain work exactly?? And remember that heartwarming last scene of An Unexpected Journey, where Thorin finally accepts Bilbo? Well, that's all gone again. Even though he keeps outsmarting all the Dwarfs, Bilbo is back to being an unappreciated 5th wheel of the party. And did the writers really think viewers would be so desperate for a love story that they'd enjoy an Elf and a Dwarf flirting it up? Their scenes feel forced and are painful to watch.\r Martin Freeman's acting is top notch again, but sadly he hardly gets any screen time. He only shines in his scene with Smaug. Now Smaug as a character is awesome, no complaints there. Yet most of his scenes are way too dragged out. There's a 20 minute scene with the Dwarfs running around thinking they can defeat him. Only at that point the movie already hinted at the only possible way of defeating him. Perhaps the worst aspect is that these scenes make Smaug look like an unintelligent creature. Dwarfs luring a Dragon around by going \"Nana-nanana you can't catch me!\" is not only silly and clich\u00e9, it's an insult to Smaug's character.\r Final complaint: the whole movie builds up to a scene.... that's apparently going to be the opening scene of movie 3. Nobody in the cinema was sure if the movie had ended, or there was just an awkwardly long pause when the screen went black.\r A movie like this you'll want to see, no matter how good or bad it is. You can't miss out on such a huge release, especially when it looks gorgeous in HFR 3D. But where I watched each Lord of the Rings movie 3 times in cinema, watching The Desolation of Smaug just once was enough for me.\r In the end, most problems of the movie seem to stem from the decision to turn the cute Hobbit tale into three epic movies that have to live up to the Lord of the Rings hype. It doesn't work."

      "text": "I LOVED the first film in this series. The Hobbit was a wonderful recreation of the first part of the book, with a few embellishments here and there that I endured. This, however, was a complete embarrassment to the Lord of the Rings series, J.R.R. Tolkien and Peter Jackson. I wanted to love it, I even forced myself to sit through the entire thing in theaters, but I just hate it. I would not take a copy of this home if you offered it to me for free, because I know watching it would only make me angry and disappointed all over again. As someone who has read all of the books and previous movies, this just felt like a pathetic excuse for a move today. This just felt like a \"filler\" film between two movies. Perhaps it was the producers being greedy, wanting 3 movies out of a book that is smaller than the smallest volume of the Lord of the Rings. However it happened, it was just disgraceful. More than half of the scenes were pulled straight out of thin air. Only a few were actually from the book this trilogy is supposed to be based on, like the barrels scene and Bilbo's talk with Smaug (although the sequence the followed was NOTHING like the book's version). What little plot that was included was embellished and out of order, and honestly were ruined for me by the imagined plots thrown into the film. On top of all that, this film had terrible pacing, and was outright cheesy at times. This was just a really, really sad excuse for a sequel. I wish they had just followed the book and stuck to two movies, the original plan. Not even sure if I am going to see the third one at this point, given the way this one turned out. Such a big fan of Tolkien's work and what Peter Jackson has done with his other novels, but this was just painful. Friends don't let friends who have read the book watch this move. Gets a 0/10 for me. I felt like not only did I waste my money, but I should have been paid to watch this poor excuse for a film."

The Hobbit was a children's book written by Tolkien for his kids and which was written before LOTR was even conceived. It was only after the popularity of this book and demand for a follow up that Tolkien set  forth  to write LOTR. It is supposed to be a fun and adventurous book and that is what the movie tries to present.\rI watched the movie in IMAX 3D HFR 48fps and i loved the whole experience. I understand that this rendering of the cinema has many critics. It is important to note every cinematic experience relies on the suspension of disbelief. It is unfair to criticise the realistic quality of the backdrop of a fantasy flick. The HFR really adds to the quality of action sequences.\rThe performances in the movie were adequate and the movie was well set-up for the final instalment of the series."

Every great thing about this part of the book was removed and replaced with orc fights. EVERY great thing. The humor, the perseverance, everything.\rThe CGI was really hit or miss until they entered the mountain, which is when the movie really came into it's own, just in time to end 20 minutes later. At one point, they mixed in helmet-cam footage from a crappy camera going through some rapids with high def footage from other angles. It looked ridiculous.\rThe love story fell so flat, you're left wondering why they bothered.\rThere was ZERO pay off in this film. If Jackson wanted to drag it out, he should have stuck to two films and stayed closer to the source material, because his embellishments have been absolute rubbish."

I thought Jackson took a little too much creative license in Part 1, however compared to Part 2 it would seem like Part 1 was letter for letter from the book. It's as if Jackson simply read the chapter titles and shot a movie with what he would think was in a chapter that could have such a title.\r Jackson spends far too much time truncating interesting portions of the story simply so he can fit more \"nowhere-in-the-book\" action scenes in spots that should have been done in one cut. Barrels out of Bond is a perfect example of this. Jackson lacks the concept of building a story up to a climax and simply turns the dial to 11 the entire time."

      "text": "I went into The Desolation of Smaug with low expectations and managed to be disappointed. Like many, I love The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, but the prequel trilogy has yet to impress.\r That\u2019s not entirely true. Peter Jackson\u2019s cameo made me laugh out loud. I also loved the visuals. My only complaint with An Unexpected Journey\u2019s visuals was that the orcs looked totally different than they did in the LotR movies. Thankfully, the orcs (with the exception of that pale fellow and his chum) are back to their old menacing look and feel.\r But TDoS does not impress in writing, acting, music, action sequences, or anything else.\r Writing: If I had taken a drink every time there was a dramatic pause followed by some God-awful, stupid line, I might have given this review a higher score on account of being too inebriated to catch all the uninspired writing and nonsensical plot filler that littered the last half of the movie.\r Acting: With how long this movie is, and with how much filler they squeezed in, it\u2019s amazing to me that it never seemed like anyone had time to properly deliver a line of dialogue. Everything felt rushed. Questions bled into answers as if the characters knew what would be said before it was said. The emotions of the characters seemed either non-existent or so over the top that the viewer could not possibly relate.\r Music: I didn\u2019t notice it until the very end when I thought, \u201cThere\u2019s music playing, isn\u2019t there?\u201d Any LotR fan knows this is a bad thing.\r Action Sequences: These were my least favorite parts of the movie, and they took up about half of the time. I love a good action sequence when it\u2019s done right. However, these are not. Half of the action was silly and cheesy, and the other half was boring (not quite half, actually, because I properly liked one bit of action: when that dwarf did a barrel roll, if you know what I mean). It was always predictable. \u201cPredictable? That\u2019s the nature of a prequel!\u201d I hear you scream. Well then tell the writers to get the action over with fast so we can focus on, say, caring about the characters.\r Anything Else: Smaug was stupid; he looked cliche-dragon, sounded cliche-deep-voice, and acted like an enemy in a bad action movie (coincidence???). The movie strayed far from the book. I mean, I\u2019m not the sort to bad-mouth a movie because it\u2019s different from the book, but I am one to bad-mouth a movie that ruins everything it touches in the book. Which in this case is everything."

END OF SPOILER.\r Given that it's the same crap, part 2, this shouldn't come as any great shock.\r Jackson seems absolutely single-minded in his determination to prove just how much of a hare-brained mess he and his nincompoop, amateur writing staff can make of a movie in the last years of his career. Apparently following his lead, the worshipful geeks in the special effects shop have set the bar as low as it will go so as not to outshine the awful script. Music is again on a repeat loop from the first trilogy. This is canned movie hacking taken to the least of the least common denominators, and it's hard to imagine how it can get any worse in part 3.\r But surely Jackson will find a way."

No such luck.\r The book is actually quite funny and the characters and there interactions hold the story. They seem like a second thought in this movie. Why are they all so suspicious of each other all the time? It gets so boring and repetitive and doesn't follow true to the book. And instead of trying to tackle the more difficult parts of the story that a book can do easily he just inserts loads of action scenes or even voice overs. [spoilers ahead] The first trilogy really gave the impressions of them having to get somewhere far away whereas here there's no pace and they basically walk into a wood, got caught then floated down a river to the mountain. Its more like a 3 hour domino rally.\r I was looking forward to Bilbo and Smaug having a chatter but was interrupted by the dwarves which was followed by another dodgy rollercoaster of an action scene to an abrupt ending.\r The Hobbit series is also starting to undermine the LOTR trilogy with endless & pointless references to the great evil, Sauron & the ring which was barely mentioned in the hobbit book. No one knew anything about it at the start of LOTR. After this movie you'd think Gandalf and the rest would of put 2  2 together as about 60 years later they fight the same villain  with the same name!\r I'm honestly starting to thing that it was padded out and split into 3 films so he could make 33% more profits for next to nothing and also save a massive amount of time actually editing out all the nonsense."

Its predecessor suffered a bit because it couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a scene-for-scene retelling of the novel or a looser, action-oriented adaptation. This film resides firmly in the second camp, and everything works better for it. For example, the escape from the Woodland Realm is every bit as over the top as the last film's escape from Goblin-town, but it doesn't feel so out of place, so it's easier just to kick back and enjoy the ride. The changes from the book once again mostly work, and in this case actually make more sense. Bard the Bargeman might not be as awesome as Bard the Bowman, at least not yet, but he is much more fleshed out, and the film finally gives the Company a decent reason for needing a burglar. I could have done without the dwarf-dragon battle at the end, I really liked the addition of Tauriel.\r My biggest objection continues to be the over-reliance on CGI. Make no mistake, the Smaug of the title is every bit as incredible as I ever imagined he could be, but decision to animate Azog's son doesn't work out so well. I understand that it was a late decision to give what was originally a live performance a computer makeover, and it shows in how unrealistic he looks next to Daddy.\r Overall, this is another fine addition to Jackson's Middle-earth saga, expanding on the previous film while avoiding its pacing pitfalls."

The last 30 minutes of this movie blew my friggin mind.  I've never seen a movie that so seamlessly integrated mind-bending effects so effectively.  Talking dragons?  Really?  It works.  Seriously"

Aside from some ridiculous elven gymnastics it was very entertaining, didn't seem overly long, and set up everything well for the finale. I look forward to the holiday season next year to finish this thing off. My three young children enjoyed this movie greatly as well. They all actually sat quietly and watched it without whining for snacks or bathroom escorts. Solid 9."

This is a much more action packed movie than its predecessor, featuring an intense giant spider attack sequence in Mirkwood Forest, a thrilling river barrel chase sequence as the dwarves attempt to escape from Elvish captors, an intense battle between Gandalf and Sauron, and a non-stop battle with the Dragon Smaug at the end.  As is to be expected, all technical credits are first rate, from the often brilliant special effects, to the stirring Howard Shore musical score, to the excellent use of High Frame Rate 3D.  In addition, the film delivers some outstanding acting, with particularly good performances from Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield, Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins and Luke Evans as a well-developed and sympathetic Bard the Bowman.  It is also great to see Orlando Bloom\u2019s Legolas back in action, and despite the initial controversy, the addition of Evangilne Lilly as the female elf warrior Tauriel is a welcome addition, even if she does not appear in the book.  The crowning achievement of the movie, however, is the Dragon Smaug (the best dragon ever portrayed on the silver screen) and his initial reveal in the ancient kingdom of Erebor is absolutely perfect.  This is followed by an Indiana Jones style climax that ends in a real cliffhanger that might irritate some.  For me it just means that the final movie, \u201cThe Hobbit: There And Back Again\u201d will launch with an absolutely incredible action sequence.  Like \u201cThe Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers\u201d, \u201cDesolation\u201d does not really have a beginning or an end, but like that brilliant movie, it is definitely one hell of a middle."

Peter Jackson's interpretation of Middle earth seems to be more and more breathtaking every film. This could very well be one of the best movies in the saga."

This one was completely on another level. Loved it from start to finish and the ending was perfect. The music at the end should win an Oscar, because it was awesome. There were a few flaws in it like the fact that Legolas had a bigger role and the length of the movie was just way too long...other than that I loved it. The fight scenes were top notch, it was funny, the dragon scene was amazing, etc."

HE DID NOT WRITE THESE BOOKS! Therefore he has NO RIGHT to change them in this manner. Pivotal storyline changed and the timeline all screwed up! There's some 40 years between The Hobbit and LotR, this is establishing a much shorter timeline. I don't want to put spoilers in but seriously, he has destroyed Tolkeins legacy with this. Bilbo is as all Hobbits a innocent, that's why he DOES NOT keep the ring hidden. Gandalf suspects but until he investigates, he does not know for sure and Bilbo DOES NOT LIE!!!!!  Beorn had such a great role in the book, but thanks to PJ, he's just an illtempered giant, Im surprised he left him in at all. And the Barrel scene!?!?! OMG, can you be setting up the next water park ride for that stupid village in NZ?  The leap of faith is the fantasy world itself, but the aim of those barrels....SHEESH, I haven't seen aim like that since Liam shot every exploding barrel in France in \"Taken\", And this Michael Bay non stop CGI action?!?!?!?! WTF!!!!!! The last movie was Harry Potter, this one is Transformers. The Hobbit DID NOT get the Peter Jackson who did LotR, it got the King Kong crap artist! I apologize for the spoilers and the anger, but seriously, I am a huge fan of the books and a man spent his entire life sweating every detail of his world. This is not homage, this is pissing on his grave!"

      "text": "Again Peter Jackson has managed to impress me. Firstly, a few niggles that I want to get off my chest. I keep seeing reviewers comparing the Hobbit trilogy with the Lord of the Rings. While this is logically understandable, it should by no means factor into the Hobbit trilogy reviews. Why? Because firstly the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings have two distinctly different feels to them, both in terms of the movies and the books. The Hobbit is supposed to be more colorful, fantasy orientated and vivid than the later more darker Lord of the Rings.  And so it is saddening to see that people use the Lord of the Rings, despite the stark contrast in the concepts, as a benchmark/basis to justify low ratings.\r Which is why when I entered the cinema, and just as I sat down now to review this movie I try to dispel all the bias and judgments that may affect me beforehand. The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug was more exciting, action packed and energetic when compared to the first film, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. While the first film served to introduce the characters, set the pace of the film and slowly familarise the audience; it was expected that  TDoS (The Desolation of Smaug) would quicken the tempo and pace, and by God it did just that! Fans of the first film will enjoy and welcome the countless fight scenes that are magical, well choreographed and don't feel over the top. If I had to pick one aspect of the film that I would of liked more, I probably would have liked to have seen more comical moments. Again, it is understandable why there were fewer comical laughs than the first film; mainly because of the quicker pace of the film, and the darker subplot; which meant that an excess of comedy would have made the sense of urgency prevalent throughout the film seem unrealistic.\r Benedict Cumberbatch as the voice of Smaug was brilliant. Sinister, yet somehow I found myself sympathising with the dragon when he retold his version of events that led to him occupying the Lonely Mountain.\r While the first film lacks action and pace, it ultimately reinforces the need for character introduction. While the second film lacks the slower pace of the first film, it is squashed by the sheer speed of which this film moves at. Even the introduction to the movie, felt as though a sense of urgency was needed. Again, this is not a negative considering the fact the film is based through the middle/second half of the book.\r Overall, brilliant film, didn't lose its way.... Slower in some scenes, but not necessary a bad aspect!\r 9/10."

It reminded me of the newer Star Wars movies in a way. It was a very entertaining I have to admit. That is rather surprising since  I did not like the first Hobbit movie at all. This one brought me back and I will certainly be catching the last movie in the series."

      "text": "Much better than the first and I didn't mind the first. I saw it in high-speed and 3d. Super well done but 2 things, the glasses are smaller than they used to be so you can see the rims which is distracting (but the crowd seems way cooler when the lights come up) and secondly the high-speed makes the production seem amateurish during the expositive scenes for some reason. So at the bar when they are talking it reminds me of a 80's British soap opera or a Canadian video production like Littlest Hobo. I think it exposes bad acting more. So a raised eyebrow by Gandalf looks kind of silly and deliberate or when Thorin notices bad guys it is super obvious like you can almost hear the director saying \"look that way, then that way...\". For the most part the action scenes are pretty spectacular, although at times somewhat video-gamey."

Martin Freeman once again fulfilled his role as Bilbo rather nicely. Ian Mckellen is getting old, but he still makes a great Gandalf. Orlando Bloom returns as Legolas and he's fun to watch. Needless to say, the best part is when Smaug finally arrives. Benedict Cumberbatch sounds better than ever as the voice behind Smaug. The action was also great and will likely please adults and children alike. Despite the film's lengthy run time and a cliffhanger ending that left me wanting more, it still delivers and not only met my expectations overall, but got me even more excited for part 3 next year!"

I mean seriously?!\r Second, as a movie itself, it is also awful.  The pacing is off once more, and the special effects just make the movie look fake.\r Congratulations Peter Jakcosn, aka the new George Lucas, for screwing up the prequels after making a brilliant LOTR Trilogy."
