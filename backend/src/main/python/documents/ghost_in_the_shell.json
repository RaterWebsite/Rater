The opening green radar screen was homaged in The Matrix), Mamoru Oshii\u2019s 1995 cyberpunk masterpiece concerns a public security agency known as Section 9 who are on the hunt for a mysterious hacker known as The Puppet Master. With the assistance of her team, Motoko Kusanagi tracks and finds the suspect only to get drawn into a complex web of political intrigue and cover-ups.Much like Blade Runner, GITS has an over-arching philosophical theme throughout it\u2019s narrative concerning self-identify. In BR case it\u2019s the question of what does the word \u201chuman\u201d mean in a world were the difference between human and robot has all but disappeared.In the case of GITS, this question is taken deeper with the character of Motoko because she is a cyborg, so everything about her is artificial except her brain. If every part of your body can be replaced, then what room is there for a soul (aka. a ghost), hence the title?It is also scary given how this movie covers the issues of hackers and corporate blackmail, which have become all too real in this day and age.Part action-thriller, part sci-fi, and part art film; GITS is a movie that seems to only get better and better as I get older. Even though the movie has some great action scenes (Ex. Invisible Motoko vs. a henchman) and thought-provoking dialogue, my personal favorite parts are whenever the film slows down to silently showcase the cityscape.The futuristic Tokyo presented in GITS differs from Akira in which it is not nearly as flashy and chaotic, but instead has a sense of surreal foreboding and alienation. Everything seems to look fine, but it all seems empty and the eerie artful score by Kenji Kawai is the icing on the cake.It can be argued that this movie is just as influential as Blade Runner given it\u2019s impact on modern-day science fiction (Ex. The Matrix, Avatar, A.I. Artificial Intelligence). It may come off as cold for some, but the deep philosophical subject manner and artful execution are what elevate this film to being one of my personal favorite films.And if you like this movie, then check out the underrated sequel, Ghost in the Shell: Innocence."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "To me this film is beautiful.

Highly innocent and equally honest. The director, Mamoru Oshii, has a precise vision about this world. In fact, the script itself might not have enough to say. Drawing plenty of the tracks from the comic book itself, the script follows a textbook structure, plot wise. Something that we have seen earlier too in a similar sci-fi futuristic world that breathes artificial intelligence and other highly configured robotic terms. And just like them, to be human, to feel and to be.. them, is what's grabbed from the first frame of the film. Reproduction takes a whole new explanation and so is death in a mythological prospect.But, what draws your attention is the layout of the film. Like some profound painting, the film is colored sensitively and staged colorfully that expresses intensively about the characters. The cinematography deserves a shout out, then so does the animation, yes, it does not hold up with time, yet, there is something soothing to every now and then, visit those perfect-imperfect world of 90s animation. It still cheers me up to see the hair in these format of the films float like they are underwater.Fortunately, the drama is embraced more, than the action is well choreographed. Even though, the stakes of the situations where our lead character often jumps in on, is low, it was smart of them to pull off an unstoppable aspect- time- for their final act. Again, I don't and didn't travel to this world for its gritty action stunts but the drama and just like the Blade Runner world, it not only doesn't thrive on it, but also is never provoked to punch its way out of the trouble, the deep down alter ego of ourselves, that Ghost In The Shell, that we all fear, is asked to face upon."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This is a brilliant work of art.
