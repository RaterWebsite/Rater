Instead, it is an ultimately monotonous tale of a prolonged, merciless assault on an ill-defined character who never has a chance and apparently wouldn't take it she had it.  It's painful for her and painful for the audience, who is left with no suspense beyond seeing what awful fate will befall this hapless victim next--like watching a gritty, modern-day Perils of Pauline, but with no one to pull the would-be heroine off the railroad tracks.  Realistic, perhaps; interesting, no.  For contrast, see Maria Full of Grace, a movie with a similar concept--it's every bit as raw as Miss Bala but actually delivers some human drama.  The real casualty here might be Stephanie Sigman, who plays the embattled victim.  In the first scenes, her portrayal of a terrified, desperate woman is palpable and stirring.  Sadly, she is forced by the script and the director to maintain that mode for the next 90 minutes.
