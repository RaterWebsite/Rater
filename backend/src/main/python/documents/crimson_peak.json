The thing that really keeps this thing going is the great cinematography, the design, special effects and the cast, particularly Jessica Chastain who, as I mentioned earlier, I  rally want to see nominated for an Oscar next year for this role and I hope the film gets some other nominations for the technical categories.  I can recommend it, though I would say, wait for this one to come out on DVD and if you are not completely sure about it, rent it first before you buy it.\r Guillermo del Toro has done a decent movie, but it\u2019s definitely not up their with his classics like Pan\u2019s Labyrinth and The Devil\u2019s Back Bone."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "We\u2019ve come to expect a certain level of creativity and high production value from a Guillermo del Toro film over the years and \u2018Crimson Peak\u2019 exceeds these expectations with a stroke of artistic flamboyance that makes it a masterful portrait of moving images.\r It\u2019s no surprise that this film is a feast for the eyes and ears, a triumphant combination of spectacular production and costume design with stunning cinematography and a powerful soundscape, no doubt \u2018Crimson Peak\u2019 will be tough to beat across a number of technical categories at next year\u2019s Oscars.\r Tom Hiddleston\u2019s performance as the conflicted \u201cSir Thomas\u201d is accomplished but the centrepiece of the film, aside from the house, is the foreboding relationship between Mia Wasikowska\u2019s \u201cEdith\u201d and \u201cLady Lucille\u201d, brilliantly played by Jessica Chastain, who despite the supernatural terrors is the true dark heart of \u2018Crimson Peak\u2019.\r However the narrative and the very nature of the film are both its strength and weakness depending on your point of view. \u2018Crimson Peak\u2019 is simultaneously a gothic romance, period costume drama, murder mystery and a stylish horror picture that harks back the \u201cGolden Age\u201d of Hollywood, albeit with Del Toro\u2019s modern artistic strokes and 55 million dollar budget.\r But straddling several genres without committing strongly to a single one leaves 2 ways of taking in the film.

Kate Hawley takes one of the aspects resaltables of the movie. Lucille slashes through that mellow golden landscape in fiery-crimson dresses or heavy all-black gowns.

Yes, it is a gothic romance, but with it blending so many different genres on top of that, it is certainly hard to fit into any circle.

Thanks to truly beautiful visuals, Crimson Peak absolutely soars and confirms my love of Guillermo del Toro's films. It can be truly violent a couple of times and does manage to scare on a couple of occasions, but its usage of ghosts in a non-scary role is truly brilliant. The design of the supernatural elements is great and they are certainly metaphorical of something, but I am personally having trouble placing my finger on what. Though it is not scary, the film manages to still be deeply unsettling thanks to the great performance of Jessica Chastain. Mia Wasikowska and Tom Hiddleston were also particularly strong here. There are numerous things that stand out to me beside these things, including the symbolic usage of bugs, the brilliant costume design, and the fantastic production design. The whole lore of the mansion, the explanation of the name, and my God the visuals. I know I mentioned the visuals, but the cinematography and visual effects were absolutely phenomenal. Those alone are worth the price of admission.

No, Toro and his co-writer Matthew Robbins make an captivating story, that sometimes can be original and dab it with smart old-fashioned humor, the film is like a painting the colors are pure ecstasy and the watching the story is breathtaking.

Trailers made the movie out to be similar to recent scare fests like The Conjuring when it is actually more Gothic and romantic like Sleepy Hollow or Bram Stoker's Dracula. With all that being said, Crimson Peak is a very engaging and creepy film. Crimson Peak is about a woman named Edith, whose heart is stolen by a stranger who leaders her to a mysterious mansion atop a hill of blood-red clay, but she quickly learns that the house and her lover hold dark secrets. What may disappoint horror fans is that this movie isn't very scary. Apart from a great deal of dread and a couple of nail-biting sequences, Crimson Peak is not a horror film. Edith describes this film perfectly when she is describing a manuscript she wrote: \"It's not a ghost story; it's a story with ghosts in it.\" It's a beautifully filmed, sexual, violent Gothic romance. There are great performances from the entire cast, with Mia Wasikowska and Jessica Chastain giving standout performances, but the best character in the film is the house itself. The mansion's elaborate and darkly beautiful design make it one of the most memorable haunted houses in film, and every single shot of it is like a piece of art. Del Toro paints such stunning imagery in Crimson Peak that you could pick any frame from the movie and hang it as an art piece. He directs each actor and shot with grace and elegance that it makes up for the film's rather predictable plot.

It is a peculiarly and aesthetically pleasing horror, but the clash between romance and thriller is neither as bold nor magical as previous incursion. The simplistic nature works more like The Woman in Black, although Del Toro's presentation does separate it from other entities.\r The plot revolves around Edith (Mia Wasikowska) who is charmed by Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) in the first act. After she's drawn to their lives, she discovers that Sharpe siblings might just hide some ominous secrets. It's a straightforward deceit and debauchery story with a few rather daunting apparitions thrown into the mix.\r The first noticeable edge Crimson Peak has is the flamboyant style of visual. Those who have watched Hellboy 2 or Pan's Labyrinth should be familiar with this graphical flair. The colors are splendidly painted, nearly every scenes have bleak backdrop yet glossy golden or scarlet undertone. Either it's from outlandish outfits or clever use of vista, the scenes where these characters interact appear nearly surreal.\r Tom Hiddleston creates a suave gentleman persona who also seems secretive and distant at times. Jessica Chastain as Lucille, the sister, is very unnerving. She's almost oozing sinister air, which is complimented well by her typical dark dress, and also a good contender for Disney lady villain. Compared to the two, Mia Wasikowska as the female lead is rather timid. She's not entirely bad, but some of her expressions don't convey the necessary dread.\r This also translates to the horror. Crimson Peak has one of the creepiest apparitions on romance themed movies, a couple of its scenes might just surpass full-fledged horror movies in recent times. However, the reaction from Edith is shockingly dull, almost seemingly lacking self-preservation instinct despite visited by constant nocturnal phantoms.\r I don't care how suave Tom Hiddleston can make excuses, the mansion has hole on the roof. While it's good for panoramic shots for falling leaves or snow, it\u2019s a clear sign of hazard. There are also patches of blood-stained dirt that seeps through the living room. Those anomalies coupled with strange occurrences and screams of night terror, Edith should realize the danger sooner, but in too many scenes she's too oblivious, partially for the sake of plot.\r Crimson Peak is a strange marriage of romance and horror. Both aspects have glimpses of brilliance, yet they never culminate in conclusion beyond what other ghost stories have told. Having benefit of classy presentation and eerie atmosphere, it's still a highly presentable horror flick. However, for those looking for another grand tale or magical journey from Del Toro, Crimson Peak might not reach such zenith."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "'Crimson Peak' is one of those movies where the director, Guillermo Del Toro, is the star. This is one of those films where the director's visual style of filmmaking upstages the story. Think of it as like 'Downton Abbey' mixed with the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and a hint of 'Pan's Labyrinth' (2006).\r It's a pretty typical horror film, especially from someone as talented as Del Toro. You can see some of the really scary parts coming from a mile away. My only issue is that some of the CGI wasn't rendered enough and some of the creatures looked a little silly at times.\r The movie stars Mia Wasikowska, Jessica Chastain, Tom Hiddleston and Charlie Hunnam, so you can expect great acting in this movie. Wasikowska's character is constantly being haunted by different ghosts and demons throughout and they tell her the same thing to be \"aware of Crimson Peak\".\r Wasikowska then meets Hiddleston's character who wants to invent and innovate. They later get married and live in his house with his sister played by Jessica Chastain, who seems extremely eerie.\r The whole film relies on suspense, and like most Del Toro films, can be deliberate in terms of pacing. Some of the scares are genuine and Del Toro crafts this expertly.\r My only issue is that the story is very predictable, and at times, it can be very cliche. If you have never seen a horror film in your life, you'll probably enjoy this and will be scared by it. But if you've seen many, scarier horror films, especially from Del Toro, you'll probably be underwhelmed with this one.\r Other than that, this film does contain scares, twists and beautiful production design. It is well acted and some of the images will give you nightmares. It's just...there are better, scarier films to see this October."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I thought that Crimson Peak had a great story, cast, directing, and visual effects.

Although it wasn't the scariest movie ever, it did deliver a few thrills, and keeps my faith in Guillermo Del Toro."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "I really enjoyed this movie. The acting, the music, the set designs and the costumes are beautiful. The ghost are really scare but they are not on screen a lot, which makes sense given the fact that is not an horror movie. The plot gets predictable some times but you still enjoy the story. It is definitely designed to be seen on the big screen to enjoy the visuals."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Crimson Peak was interesting in many ways, but ultimately not very good. My main problems were Tom Hiddleston, who I believe was miscast, and the script, which had no spark of originality whatsoever. I read that Benedict Cumberbatch was supposed to do the Hiddleston role, and I missed him all the time. I am sure he could have made more of the part than Hiddleston did who was too bland for a gothic \u201chero.\u201d Hey, Hiddleston, never seen Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights??? Mia Wasikowska was more or less interesting, depending on whether she wore her hair up or down (it was that kind of a movie) and Jessica Chastain was great. She seemed to understand that this was about \u201cscenery chewing\u201d and went for it, so she was the only character who was fun to watch and didn\u2019t seem to have a stick up the you-know-what. But it is a beautiful film with interesting special effects and the haunted house was fantastic. But I kept thinking \u2013 is this the same director who did Pan\u2019s Labyrinth and The Devil\u2019s Backbone?"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Del Toro spends almost ten years to make his imaginative horror love story into the big screen, it works well as a periodic gothic romance thanks to its beautiful setting and sumptuous costumes yet falls short due to its predictable plot at the very opening of the film. It's a film full with paintings, dreams, terrifying fantasy and the addition of several modern types disturbing scares that really fit perfectly into the story but the supernatural are far more lesser than expected. Both Mia Wasikowska and Tom Hiddleston deliver solid performance while Jessica Chastain surprises audiences the most in which she is able to have fun expanding the full potential of her eerie character physically, mentally and emotionally well. Despite the disappointing story line and the CGIs of the spirits which look like those in Mama, this artistic and sombre film on a woman trapped in the social conventions is worth a watch for its creativity of combining both modern and classical elements."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Guillermo del Toro brings back the Gothic Romance in a beautifully twisted way. Crimson Peak bathes in rich atmosphere and incredible art direction. The cast is uniformly great, with Jessica Chastain being the standout, as she deliciously chews the scenery. Tom Hiddleston plays a man of charm and mystery very well. Mia Wasikowska is delightful in her naivety.Things sort of play out as you'd expect, but half the fun here is being ahead of the characters. The film is primarily an exercise in atmosphere, and what an accomplishment it is in that regard. Crimson Peak didn't do very well in theaters, but I hope people continue to discover its lavish and deranged wonders as time goes on."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I went into this movie expecting a \"classic\" oriented plot and genuine horror, and the film lived up to my expectations. Guillermo Del Toro does not rely on cheap scare tactics found in most horror movies (i.e. \"pop out\" scenes, over the top gore, etc.) but rather focuses on character development and the plot itself. This film does a great job of making the audience care about the characters and tells a good story. I wasn't so much scared in the traditional sense that I lose sleep at night; but more so that I connected with the characters and felt their suspense. The well developed characters and intriguing plot set up the viewer's emotions for the scary scenes. You may not necessarily come home from Crimson Peak and lose any sleep at night, but if you like a good story you will be satisfied and hope that Hollywood goes more in this direction with horror than it does most modern day horror flicks."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "In the aftermath of a family tragedy, an aspiring author is torn between love for her childhood friend and the temptation of a mysterious outsider. Trying to escape the ghosts of her past, she is swept away to a house that breathes, bleeds... and remembers.\r Director Guillermo Del Toro returns with an interesting cast for Crimson Peak, his passion project, that certainly delivers on visuals and atmosphere. There are ghosts, macabre horror and jumps scares, but this is more tragic romance than anything else. Allerdale Hall, home of the Sharpe siblings, is a character in it's own right. A swirling staircase, narrow hallways, creaking floors, an exposed roof, courtyard machinery, and an elevator shaft that is central to the plot. The rooms are covered in darkness with lamps and fireplaces illuminating the dark, brownish green walls and furniture.\r Unfortunately the story just isn't that interesting, beneath those luscious visuals, it doesn't really go anywhere. It's as if Del Toro and his writing partner thought of every gothic horror cliche, throwing them all into a script that perhaps was written in a day. Ir's not a grind to get through however, everything moves at a decent pace, the tone is tightly consistent throughout and the plot is easy to follow, and maybe that's what lets it down. Plenty of promise but nothing challenging for the viewer.\r The characters, wether by accident or intent, come across a little dopey. Mia Wasikowska plays Edith Cushing, a wanna-be writer haunted by her dead mother who has warned her since she was a child, \"Beware of Crimson Peak!\" She falls for British aristocrat Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston), and after the death of her father, moves in with Thomas and his sister Lucille (Jessica Chastain). Behind Edith's back, the brother and sister plan to swindle her out of her fortune. Turns out she isn't the first wife Thomas has tried to kill with poisoned tea, under the instructions of Lucille.\r Charlie Hunnam plays the childhood friend to Edith, but he comes and goes without much presence. Hiddleston, although dashing as always, fails to give any life to his character. It's only Chastain and the third act that save this film, her anger exploding during a brilliant sequence of bloody stabbings and the chasing of Edith around the gothic mansion before the finale in the foggy, white snow and red clay covered courtyard.\r Interestingly, Crimson Peak will divide the audience into loving or hating it, much like another recent Del Toro project, Pacific Rim. For me it edges itself into a positive score with memorable visuals albeit a predictable direction."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Extremely atmospheric and well acted, \"Crimson Peak\" offers the audiences, a good old Gothic romantic story with splendid visuals and an interesting plot."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "It's certainly flawed in dreary dialogue and a slight extinguish of intrigue during the second act, but crimson peak is a solid, and decaying, romance chiller (rather than a thriller...this was more \"depressive\" let's say) and was filled with gorgeous scenery and visual imagery that had a firm grasp around the majority of this film's weaknesses. Sometimes it didn't know where it was going, but I guess the sickly aura of this film and it's calm uneasiness brings about the fact that love is indeed a cruel and bitter ghost."}], "recommendations": ["candyman", "last_night_in_soho", "sleepy_hollow", "the_others", "what_lies_beneath", "stoker", "dark_city", "the_ninth_gate", "the_fly", "the_neon_demon", "mandy", "doctor_sleep", "the_mothman_prophecies", "the_lodge", "the_crow", "nocturnal_animals", "color_out_of_space", "the_grand_budapest_hotel", "the_conjuring_2", "lights_out", "doctor_strange", "the_cell", "suspiria", "the_ballad_of_buster_scruggs", "the_brothers_grimm"]}
