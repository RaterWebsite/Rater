Robert Rodriguez is very talented, with movies like El Mariachi, Desperado and recently Alita, he portrays quick witted protagonists.  This is well photographed, nicely edited and very well acted.  The red alert for parents in trouble came at a weird time. I find it difficult these days to sit through movies about happy families, loving and loyal.  Every family I ever saw was about competition and manipulation, with every member of the family having no other priority except to sabotage the others."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "It's a good movie, decent effects, likeable characters, and the sequel is pretty good to. It's to bad they released 3-D and the horrible spin-off Shark boy and Lava Girl."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "I was expecting a lot from Spy Kids. From the trailer it looked like cool and smart fun. Well, I got something completely different from what I expected. The film was cool with its gadgets and gizmos, neat one-liners and brilliant kid?s action sequences (which are not developed enough or long enough), but in the long run, this film was a disappointment. The plot was stupid beyond belief. I didn?t laugh that much. The film has high potential, is endlessly imaginative and brings up some cool creations, but I found the story laughable and the whole brother story just tired. The film was predictable and as soon as we get to Floop?s castle thing, the stupidity takes over. Those thumbs are just plain lame and although the flawless visuals are good to look at and the art direction is stunning, the walking-see-sensing thumb-people and colourful Floop TV companions are just stupid. The movie would?ve been much better if they had come up with something just as creative but not as laughable. The acting was pretty. The direction was pretty impressive and the visuals excel the most. The film dreams up excellent ideas and is creative, but the story and script are really quite low-key. With the sequel, get rid of those dumb-ass thumbs and companions, come up with a better story, cut the corn and get to the good stuff."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Spy Kids isn't something terribly great, but kids will enjoy it with It's great performances, and a good voice acting.

This trademark film starring Alexa Vega and Antonio Banderas is gripping and fun. He has made a great film for kids and adults to enjoy. It does have flaws that are forgetful but overall, it's a GOOD movie, just plain cheesy fun for anyone who watches it. Spy Kids is epic."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Playful and quirky, mixed in with a story of a dysfunctional and unorthodox family's struggle, fueled by a humorous sibling rivalry. The animation works into the eccentricity, and the acting is  well enough for 'Spy Kids' to be like a spontaneous roller-coaster, and a fun one at that. I had fun watching it, even today, while I'm in high school."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Spy Kids is an enjoyable kids movie that may try to hard sometimes and take itself too seriously in some places, but ultimately is good for what it is."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "A spy comedy / family movie. It takes itself not that serious and just wants to entertain. This works well for me. The story is about the retired top spies Gregorio and Ingrid Cortez who have retired and are happily married with children. However they never told their kids about their past days as spies. One day they are called back into action and this starts the events of the movie. I am avoiding spoilers here. The story is humorous and entertains from start to finish. A lot comes from the strong cast and I will just praise all characters. Special bonus for Danny Trejo ;-). The humor is spot on and I laughed a lot during the movie. I want to praise the creativity and the up to eleven spy gadgets. Even Q from James Bond will be jealous. The effects looked good back then but I am not sure how those hold up. Overall I give an 8/10 and recommend it for its fun entertainment. Might not be art or an all time classic but don't needs to be."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "It is pretty awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Spy Kids is another adventure waiting for you kids and adults out there.

Robert Rodriguez created a great film, one of the most recognizable children's films of the early 2000s. Not a bad cast, absurd plot and cheap CGI. Here's a formula for success. Surprisingly, Spy Kids can make you laugh and looks interesting. This is rare in children's films. Spy Kids have launched a whole franchise, for many, the first part will seem the best. Only the absence of a distinct antagonist and a crumpled ending disappoints. For me personally, Banderas's role in Spy Kids is one of the most familiar. Spy Kids can be recommended for viewing by all families with children."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Gran pel\u00edcula y una gran franquicia.
