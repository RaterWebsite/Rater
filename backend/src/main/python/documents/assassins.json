      "text": "This is an intrguing documentary. I remember hearing the story in the news a few years ago and certainly Korea (esp. North Korea) is well known for being incredibly secretive as far as their royalty and government is concerned. Its a good, solid documentary. I felt it was interesting in terms of the media/press perspectives, the way the legal case developed and so on. If your interested in the story or North Korea in general, then I'd recommend this documentary, yes."
