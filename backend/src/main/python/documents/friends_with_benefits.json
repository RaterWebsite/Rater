      "text": "Ad nauseum, in rom-com after rom-com, the man inevitably arrives at that moment when everything becomes crystal clear, in regard to the woman he loves yet carelessly let slip away. As a corrective measure to his mistake, the man saves the relationship by proving his love with the right words to the woman, who only moments ago, stood in resignation with her dashed hopes. Usually the woman is standing in an airport terminal. Usually the man gets there by some mode of frantic transport. Usually they seal the deal with a kiss. Reared on formulaic filmmaking, it's no wonder that Tom Hansen in \"500 Days of Summer\", continues to misread the ending of \"The Graduate\", his favorite film about true love which he shares with Summer Finn, as happy. Except for the people who understand that Benjamin Braddock and Elaine Robinson are not in love, nobody has ever said, \"Shut up, Katherine Ross, you stupid liar!\" Especially Summer, who can plainly see the ambivalence forthwith, grow among the young folks in the back of the bus, when only a moment ago, the part that Tom, after all these years, is still reeling from, shows Benjamin crashing Elaine's wedding, plaintively crying out her name while he rattles the big church window with his fists. In a flash, however, the emotional high of stealing the bride from the groom, peaks when young Ben traps the angry congregants by barricading the doors with a cross, the Christian icon he uses as a weapon against institutionalized love, waving it around like a bat. On the bus, the moviegoer waits for him to kiss the runaway bride, but he doesn't even touch Mrs. Robinson's daughter, let alone, hold her gaze for more than a heartbeat. Using selective memory, Tom tries to pigeonhole \"The Graduate\" with any other romantic comedy, most of which depict love as a byproduct emanating from the grand romantic gesture, usually in a public place with adoring onlookers. Summer, however, in that repertory house, doesn't miss a thing; she sees the film's authorial commentary, an in-film post-script, about the artifice of movie love, and breaks it off with Tom later over pancakes. At the diner, Summer compares themselves to Sid and Nancy, an apra pro allusion to the punk rock aesthetic of the Nichols film, in the sense that Benjamin and Elaine are nihilists for rebelling against convention. Don't blink, and you'll see how \"Friends with Benefits\", like the tagline for \"500 Days of Summer\" states, ultimately, \"is not a love story,\" as well, with its \"Graduate\"-esque coda, ergo a deconstruction of the romantic comedy in the last frame. Too conventional for the label \"meta-film\", the film has just enough subversiveness to trump its climactic scene at Grand Central Station, where Dylan tells Jamie, without a trace of irony, that he's in love with her, turning their lives into the very thing(a romantic comedy), they both had agreed was fictive; merely a Hollywood construct which damages people with its unrealistic idealism pertaining to relationships. In an earlier scene, Jamie convinces Dylan to scale the Hollywood sign, representational of the fact that the executive recruiter believes in celluloidal love, although at times the woman forsakes the faerie tale, like when she publicly rails against Katherine Heigl, the scapegoat of her romantic woes. Meanwhile, the art designer gets stuck up there and requires the services of a helicopter, analogous to the rescue being executed by the film's satirical form, whose self-awareness is supposed to set the movie apart from contemporaneous examples of the genre, such as \"The Ugly Truth\". But just because the film foregrounds the artificiality of the \"meet-cute\", it doesn't make the \"meet-cute\"(where Jamie chases an I.D. sign on the baggage carousel) go away. A trope is still a trope, even when it's filmically italicized. As a result, the film can hardly be called a satire, not with a touch so light that the skewering comes off less as a criticism of genre convention than a reason for optimism where life could imitate art. Luckily, although the two leads are far from being the next Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn(the referencing of Amazon.com alludes to \"Desk Set\", a 1957 film about computers which was dead wrong in predicting the relevancy of people), they're also equidistantly ahead of Heigl and \"Killers\" co-star Ashton Kutcher, as well. To it's credit, the film gets real in the final scene, where Dylan and Jaime, now, supposedly more than friends with benefits, suddenly look awkward and bored, as they share a booth in the cafe. They're the couple from \"The Graduate\", but with a crucial difference. Instead of extending the silence, they reach across the table and tear into each other, in essence, updating \"When Harry Met Sally\" by faking love instead of an orgasm. They're not meant for each other, as advertised, but unlike Benjamin and Elaine, it won't stop them from having sex."

      "text": "There will be no comparisons to \"No Strings Attached,\" this movie is rather easy to review.  Although the movie technically has two parts.  The first 45 minutes of the movie is a laugh riot, and it manages to capture some of the the raunchy vulgar comedy that the movie sets out to accomplish.  However, this is only the first half of the movie, the rest of the movie barely manages to keep its head above the water of cliches.  The second half of the film gives only a few quick chuckles, but in between them, the movie might actually put you asleep.  Where the first half would get a 9, the second half would barely hit a 5, so I give this movie a 7."

      "text": "This will inevitably draw comparisons to No Strings Attached (the Ashton Kutcher-Natalie Portman pals-doing-the-nasty comedy from earlier this year), so let's just get one thing out of the way: FWB is actually kinda GOOD, unlike NSA. Here's what's good about it: Witty, sharp dialogue that's well delivered, great chemistry between the actors, good acting, engaging side characters and side plots. The actors and their characters are likable. The ride is enjoyable and has just enough seriousness to give the plot weight and make the characters not seem like vapid singletons living in a New York bubble. Also, the jokes are funny and often smart, without being snooty. The pacing is also good, although I'll be honest and say it loses some momentum towards the end. It's predictable enough, as all romantic comedies ultimately are (and isn't that why we see them?) so think of this movie as more about than the journey than the destination."

He would be able to understand New York without walking around like a rube.  I agree with other posters that Emma Stone would have been a better pick for the female lead.  The ending was no surprise and nobody who even read the title would not see that they would fall in love.  You never forget that you are must watching Justin and Mila, not characters in a real situation. But they are pretty and there are some amusing moments in it which makes it a painless diversion.  The sex scenes were just this side of soft porn though and I felt unnecessary to further the plot.  They could have been softened without hurting the humor the two of them were creating in their bedroom romps."

It was sorta sad to see how hard she had to work, but I like her, I like her acting, and I think she did a good job. Meanwhile, Justin Timberlake proved that he has NO charisma whatsoever. Nor can he act. If they had cast a talented actor in this movie, it would have been significantly more enjoyable - John Krasinski could have saved this movie- but they didn't cast Krasinski, they cast the stiff-as-wood Timberlake.My other major problem with this movie was the flashmob scenes. So cringe-worthy, and not in an adorable way. Flash mobs were over way before this movie came out, yet they play an important part in the plot. Further proof that hollywood writers should be careful about writing-in internet fads. I put my head in my hands during the scene where Justin Timberlake says \"What is this?\" and Mila's character excitedly explains \"It's a flash mob!\" Oh really grandma?"

It's as if they were trying to sound cool by making the characters spew racey banter, but the lines simply were not funny. I'm a fan of Timberlake because I admire how he went from Disney to a ridiculous boy band, to then becoming a respectable solo artist and then a talented actor. Mila is just plain HOT. So I went in here thinking that I would enjoy this movie. WRONG! I am always amazed at how movies like this get favorable reviews. I guess there's no accounting for taste. Be warned."

Kunis is terrific, Timberlake is under-directed (though fun), and Patricia Clarkson (who I love, generally) is bordering on parody.  Jenna Elfman is great is a small role, and Woody Harrelson easily steals the show.  Like many of the critics, I think the banter between the leads is solid.  The ending just falls flat.  And using flashmobs?? (especially via the Uroboros....)  A little tired. But it's much better than the Ashton Kutcher film along the same lines from earlier this year.  I just wish that what started out as an unconventional relationship didn't wind up so conventionally."

Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake are fairly decent actors so I have to interpret their misreading of the main characters to bad direction (Am I the only one who thinks Emma Stone would have been a better choice for the lead than Kunis?).  Woody Harrelson does is best with the role of the gay sportswriter (a twist but still a cliche) and probably has the funniest moments of the film.  Patricia Clarkson plays the cool but unavailable hippie mom who undoubtedly is the source of Kunis' insecurity.  Don't get me wrong there were some decent moments (John F'ing Mayer, Harrelson's relentless recruiting of hetero men) but the dialog seems forced and the \"we're cooler than you are\" premise falls short.  The one saving grace of this film is the undeniable attractiveness of the lead characters.  Timberlakes' legion of female (and male) fans will leave the theater feeling they got their money shot, I mean money's worth."

When Harry Met Sally, Pretty Woman, etc. Down with Love is one of my all-time favorites too, but not exactly realistic, but still adorable.  Friends with Benefits fits the criteria better than I've seen in years.  In the Rom-Com genre, the film is near perfect.  The chemistry between JT and Kunis is flawless and believable.  The use of New York and Los Angeles were reflections of both their personalities and, thus, enhanced an understanding of the characters.  The writing is smart, the editing makes the movie flow seamlessly and it even finds a way to make fun of itself and its genre.  I enjoyed the film from the opening scene to the final credits."

So natural and unforced with genuine amiable humour. Timberlake is really growing as a great actor who is able to inject a fair degree of depth into his character.A great story which makes you feel good ... or embarrassed when you realise that the tongue-in-cheek mocking of Hollywood rom-coms is in fact just mocking all those who watch it and think we will all experience the fairy tale at some stage!

The plot is simple and straightforward. Dylan (Justin Timberlake) and Jamie (Mila Kunis) are singletons in the Big Apple and come to the decision to be friends who sleep together. (I.e Friends With Benefits) And ofcourse the film explores the effects this has on them both. The chemistry between Timberlake and Kunis is superb and ultimately one of the keys to how good the film is. The film also has great dialogue thats performed terrificly by the cast, and thats another area where the film excels the some of the side characters, Woody Harrelson in particular, are awesome and obviously the humour is very well done as the jokes will make you LOL! FWB is a decent length but its enjoyable throughout and provides some genuinly funny moments. Importantly though the serious side of the film shines through when needed and gives it enough all the way through and allow the characters to be likeable and not seem to be the stereotypical cliched couple in so many movies. The film does become predictable as it nears its conclusion, afterall it as a romantic-comedy and it does slightly lose some of the momentum but that doesn't prevent this from being another fine comedy from Mr Gluck in what is a fine follow up to Easy A and easily one of the best rom-com's of recent times.

I predicted that the plot was going to be predictable (as most films of this genre are) and my predictions were correct.  They did throw a curve-ball.  A Hail Mary attempt at tugging at our heart strings just a tad more than most summer romance comedy's do.  This was done with Justin Timberlake's father in the film.

Kunis and Timberlake shine and play off of each other like old pros. What is even more amazing is the true heart of it. Both characters have to deal with family issues that are real and honest. My one problem is believing that these characters are damaged, which they will repeatedly tell the audience. This however can be easily overlooked in favor of casting, plot, and chemistry."

I mean there were some parts that i found brilliant, but others just didn't make sense to me. I mean i love romantic stories and this was one of them. I just didn't really follow on the whole thing. I mean i wouldn't really call it a romantic comedy. I would call it more of a dramatic comedy."

Both had amazing cast but Friends with Benefits got on top coz its funnier then that one . As for Rom-Com Crazy,Stupid,Love was way better then this but still its worth seeing . Good acting and Justin was good also Mila But Woody Harrelson was the funniest . as for the story .....Sucks . So Friends with Benefits is a funny Rom-Com with an amazing Cast and a sucky Story ."

D\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00a0 l\u00c3\u00a0, les deux actrices \"s'affrontaient\" dans l'univers de la danse. Maintenant, c'est dans la com\u00c3\u00a9die sentimentale (Sex Friends pour Portman, Sexe entre Amis pour Kunis). Pour la rivale de la grande Mathilda (r\u00c3\u00a9f\u00c3\u00a9rence \u00c3\u00a0 L\u00c3\u00a9on), Mila Kunis fait \u00c3\u00a9quipe avec un excellent Justin Timberlake dans une com\u00c3\u00a9die romantique qui ne sort pas des sentiers battus. Chaque s\u00c3\u00a9quence sent le d\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00a0-vu et se montre pr\u00c3\u00a9visible. Mais l\u00c3\u00a0 o\u00c3\u00b9 s'en sort Sexe entre Amis compar\u00c3\u00a9 \u00c3\u00a0 Sex Friends, c'est qu'il est moins guimauve, que le duo Kunis/Timberlake fonctionne parfaitement, et que le film poss\u00c3\u00a8de un humour qui fait tr\u00c3\u00a8s souvent mouche, sans tabou et sans vulgarit\u00c3\u00a9 non plus. En somme, Sexe entre Amis se montre \u00c3\u00aatre une com\u00c3\u00a9die bien sympathique. Et en ce moment, c'est vraiment ce qu'il faut pour se d\u00c3\u00a9tendre !"
