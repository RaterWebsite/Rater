      "text": "If you've seen the trailer you'd expect a cute comedy about a retired man (Robert De Niro) who becomes the intern for the overloaded exec of an online fashion site (Anne Hathaway). It does start in that direction and there are some mildly charming moments. About half way thru, it careens resolutely toward chick flick territory, as the focus moves from the office to the challenges of her marriage. Even with writer/director Nancy Meyer's upbeat style, the film takes a somber tone and serious pace that drags it down. De Niro has never been blander and Hathaway is OK, while the supporting characters lack any spice. Meyers' messages about women in the workplace and dull determination to focus on the marriage takes a potentially amusing movie into tedious trite territory."

I mean it was well written screenplay with much better understood the contemporary world than just focusing on the relationships as usual. So the addition of digital world stuffs made all the difference and I completely enjoyed it. Don't think it would be another 'The Internship' as I initially thought, but slightly it is and much better everyway.\r You are going to agree with me that the film's posters or the trailers were not very impressive as what the actual film did to grab our full attention. The two hours films are always a concern to me, but when a film like this runs for that long, I can even sit for another half an hour. Anyway, with this story and its runtime, the pace was incredible. When there's something interesting is going on, we forget to focus on the flaws and enjoy our time, which is what I exactly did in here.\r This is not a comedy where you're going to laugh openly loud, it is a comedy in the sense of the set of characters the film has. I mean, the story is about the digital business and most of them who are into the computers are considered as geeks. So theirs world is nothing, but just hooked to their works and forgetting the actual world around them. Even for the someone in the next room, they tweet. For them to remind only they've changed, not the physical world and that's where our main character who is old and wise influence the younger generation people.\r So the actors were undoubtedly the best thing apart from the direction and the story. The 73 years old Robert De Niro still impressing with his extraordinary character display. I don't know whoever was in mind when it was written, but this role perfectly fits none other than him. And then there's Anne Hathaway on the opposite side who equaled with De Niro with her part.\r From the narration point of view, it started with DeNiro's, but quickly around in the middle it took a circle to cover others as well. And then comes from the professional to the personal life topic when it was developed and brought a small family who were affected by the workaholic mother. So if you enter it expecting a comedy, probably you won't disappoint with what it delivers against your wish which is a heartwarming drama with some emotional moments. Surely recommended, especially the youngsters who're addicted to the digital world!\r 8/10"

      "text": "Not to confuse with 2013 Fox's The Internship, this similar type of drama without a ship behind feels more promising, funny but not ridiculous and thoughtful which one could have expected through its poster. The story delivers something fresh, a creative idea of senior citizen internship program to present the cross-generation relationship, events that are commonly occur in daily working life and how important is the experience of the elderly to inspire the younger generation. The film moves in a smooth pace, filled with nice musics and inspiring scores, along with a gentle spirit that attracts audiences to spend time following the amusing characters for about 120 minutes but a little bit upset by the rushing second half and too unrealistic perfection on its ending. However, the warm, charming and charismatic chemistry between De Niro and Hathaway is the sweetest and most beautiful part of the film to enjoy which makes us believe that we can manage well both career and family life."

It is like a Romantic Comedy without the romance and smoosh! I am not a fan of watching and listening to kissing sounds and over done formulaic in romantic comedies or any other film (Unless it\u2019s about sex such as shades).\rI am happy to announce the star here really is De Niro. The man can put on a singlet and make you feel under dressed. His smooth charm works here as he brings all his life stories and experiences to a new young age of online finances and shopping and the modern day Ebayer. With just his Briefcase, glasses and a Handkerchief in his pocket.  Showing the young talent to not only be fast on their feet but to slow down and take it all in once in a while. It\u2019s ok to have your face on a screen all day for work and not have to feel ashamed because you\u2019re a parent working multiple jobs. You do what you do and you do it to the best of your ability. Life will get in the way, but it won\u2019t leave you behind if even it all out.\rAnne Hathaway is gorgeous as usual. Her smile melts my insides. Hathaway plays Jules Ostin a woman who has built her own online clothing business from the ground up. She works ridiculous hours and some of her colleagues decide it to be best to bring in some help for her and offer some older generations to show them how it\u2019s done. She really makes the working Mum role seem so natural. I think these scenes were directed beautifully. Her fulltime job is so insanely busy we don\u2019t even know she has a Husband and a child until at least 20 minutes into the film. This is not misdirection. It is there to really show you how busy her life is and it works. One scene I loved included a birthday party with school mum\u2019s doing what school mum\u2019s can do (looking down on you for not being an at home Mum) De Niro gets involved and well, it is just great to watch.\rOne of the biggest stand outs for me here is Jules Husband played by Anders Holm. He absolutely smashes the at home Dad role fantastically. He reverses the movie Male roles of so many films gone by and flips it on its head and slams it right down into modern day. Yes there are full time stay at home Dad\u2019s and no not all of them are dole bludging, video game loving lazy butts. He looks after their daughter mostly 24/7 and puts his own career into the trash so that his wife can really shine at what she does best. A lot more plays into this later and I will not spoil it. I believed the ending was just. Many will not. Our mistakes are what makes us stronger in most cases.\rThe rest of the younger cast in this are all awesome. Each character is given a little screen time and just enough to make us care. Andrew Rannells (Tv\u2019s Girls) has the same role he seems to have in all his shows and films. But it still works here and I love him.\rI will wrap this up by saying try not to miss this. If you love a good hearted drama/comedy. This one will not disappoint. It doesn\u2019t change the film making form in any leaps and bounds as most blockbusters of the year try to. But it leaves you feeling like it accomplished something. It also left me feeling like Robert De Niro is a true veteran of the class and a fine form, even in his later years. If this was to be his last film, it would have been a damn fine send off."

Apparently the modern male is a cheating, unkempt, chauvinistic, ill mannered, and immature manchild with no good role models while the fantastically flawless 'classic male' of 'the good old days' in De Niro is free of any of the massive prejudices of his time. Comparatively, the women of the film come out smelling like roses.\r Beyond that the film is a mixed bag. Decently produced and tries to be charming, but the laughs are never notable and the messages often come off smug and preachy. I do think Hathaway did a decent job but it's contrasted by De Niro's extremely bland performance. All in all an interesting premise and opportunity fairly squandered."

As with so many of her prior films, Ms. Myers focuses upon the empowered woman of talent and achievement and the problems faced by those in her gender. :Baby Boom\", :It\u2019s Complicated\" and \"Something's Got to Give\" are just a few examples Although Ms. Hathaway does not yet equal the caliber or experience of a Diane Keaton or Meryl Streep, she gives a convincing performance as a successful woman in a man\u2019s world. Mr. DiNero gives a warm and sensitive performance as an intern hired by Ms. Hathaway\u2019s firm who, but for his age and retirement status, would be sought after as a vital addition to any enterprise. The film touches upon and engages in many issues including the value of senior citizens with experience versus their younger counterparts and, as so many employers have been finding out, offer a different and deeper dimension to the jobs they fill. I give the film an 8 and suggest that recent and former members of the work force will appreciate the messages it sends,"

Surprisingly, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I even left feeling satisfied. Robert De Niro was as charming as ever. Anne Hathway did a great job playing a conflicted, unlikeable woman without making her likeable. That is, many actresses make their characters likeable because they feel they must be, which is not true. It's an interesting premise, which Meyers turns into an intelligent plot. The only thing I didn't like about this film was that De Niro's character was a perfect human being. He's flawless, which doesn't seem real. Otherwise, it made me laugh plenty and even tear up in a scene. It's very moving and charming."

      "text": "I wasn't expecting much from The Intern. Like most older actors, the work isn't quite what it once was for Robert De Niro. He's fared better than most actors who have also entered their later years, and the man is still delivering dedicated performances, but his recent string of movies have received middle-of-the-road reviews or been outright critically panned, minus a few exceptions. The Intern stands among of his more fondly recognized works of the past few years, but the professional reception has still been rather lukewarm. I thought that was because it was just going to be another schmaltzy \"old people still got it\" comedy lacking in any original jokes and in desperate need of some actual emotional depth as the trailers made it seem. Imagine my surprise when it turned out to be a pretty thoughtful movie that takes an interesting look at the challenges of modern day life for two different generations and won me over with it's warm-heartedness.Nancy Meyers takes the time to make us familiar with the workplace of it's online fashion startup. We get to know the supporting characters and grow to love them just as much as the two leads. Hathaway and De Niro are incredible. Their chemistry is sublime and each allows their character a great deal of emotional depth and nuance. Meyers has a way with dialog and character interactions that makes it a lot of fun to just watch everyone get together and talk whether it be in groups or one-on-one conversations. Watching the core friendship bloom in the face of difficulties is both sweet and charming. It carries the movie forward even when it feels like nothing is really going on story-wise. The events going on in the background of the company feel somewhat inconsequential as they are easily dismissed and overcome in favor or placing the urgency and attention on seemingly trivial problems. Hathaway's character is on the search for a CEO to help her manage her company better, but The Intern is less interested in telling us about that and would rather have us focus on her OCD about a cluttered desk instead. At least the troubles in everyone's personal lives aren't treated the same way. That's where the real drama and growth occurs.The Intern can be a pretty funny movie. Perhaps a little unevenly so though. It's better with smaller, quirkier interactions providing the majority of the laughs. It's bigger gags like an amusing midday heist and oddly raunchy massage sequences feel like they belong in a different movie. It's as if Meyers shoehorned these in so that this generation's style of comedy could give The Intern broader appeal. Understandable, but perhaps a little misguided.I grew to love the characters here and got caught up in their personal affairs. I was also in awe of De Niro and Hathaway who really give incredible performances. Their almost familial bond is not something I would have originally expected. The way it tackles modern day issues and delivers a genuinely intelligent, non-preachy feministic message is admirable. The small scale does allow for some inconsistencies across the board such as the humor, but also makes it possible for viewers to get more personally involved with everything happening. Something that's also made easy by just how likable everybody onscreen is. 7.5/10"

The cure for that issue is super grandpa Robert De Niro who can do everything including cleaning a messy desk the office just throws their crap on.. If De Niro's character wasn't there, one character would forever look like a bum and another would always be in the friend zone. Why does his character do it? Well, as stated in the beginning he became an intern because he is bored with retirement, which means this movie has no real plot so the climax resides on the female's lead to stop being so indecisive.  But if you can tolerate the old people jokes, then this movie becomes a feel good emotional drama about what it means to live and learn."

Stop,\rRidiculous."

      "text": "A woman at my local public library described \"The Intern\" as \"cute,\" and I think that sums it up.  One might be led to assume, based on the marketing, that this is a film about the Robert Deniro character providing sage advice and brilliant insights based on his many decades of business experience.  It is not.  The film is about making new friends.  Deniro's character makes lots of new friends.  And he's there for them, ready with a smile, a handkerchief, a shoulder to cry on.  Don't be fooled into thinking that he's holding back on the sage advice until some critical moment arrives and disaster waves a menacing hand.  He's not holding back.  The critical moment never arrives.  Things just amble along to a very quiet finale and then we all go to the park to practice tai chi.\r I don't think the filmmakers know a lot about geeks, any kind of geeks, because I've met a few and they're not all adorable teddy bears, but, hey, It's not a bad movie.  Deniro will drag you along.  Just don't expect fireworks."

      "text": "De Niro and Hathaway suit the roles of there characters perfectly in The Intern, which makes this film worth watching. But, the fact that the actual main plot of the is quite similar to other films, makes it a bit boring to watch is some parts. I also found that there was way too much adverting, every where you looked, Apple, Apple, Samsung, Apple, HP. The film isn't bad but it is not fantastic either."

      "text": "Robert De Niro teaches boys how to become men by giving them lessons on work place apparel (aka always wear a suit), organization (aka desks never look like they're actually being used, but rather preserved for a tour of scholars to marvel at the immaculate symmetry) and by revealing to them that real men carry handkerchiefs so they can offer it to the crying ladies.\r Asides from that De Niro serves as Anne Hathaway's father, friend, life coach, therapist, zen master and all in all manly man swag master shoulder to lean on. So much so that they spend a night in bed together wearing bath robes while Hathaway cries. I'm not kidding, it actually happens.\r Also the script writer gets to vicariously vent through Anne Hathaway's character by going on a rant about how men these days all look like children with all the video games, t-shirts and neck beards. Everybody knows real men wear suits, drink vodka martinis and introduces themselves by saying their last names first.\r Oh, and after cheating on Hathaway her husband wins her back with part of his little speech including this line,\r \"It's a confusing world out there, and who I am got messed up for a minute.\"\r Don't yah just hate when in this confusing world you find yourself sleeping with your wife one minute and then with another woman the next? I think we can all relate to that. See, any affair can be smoothed over just by reminding your significant other that the world is confusing. For example, 'I don't know what happened honey! One minute we were making love, the next minute I was f$*#ing your best friend... Please take me back I was confused!'"

The Intern has De Niro trying and succeeding in this role, but fails to take advantage by putting dopey jokes and ridiculously obvious plot starters in his way."

When the screen faded to black, I was left with a sombre feeling and a swollen heart. This is not one to miss if you like a touching, feel good movie."

No surprises, just gentle emotional exercise through slight tugs at your heart-strings. Parts give the impression of having been written to provoke very mild amusement. I didn't laugh, but I did stay awake all the way through, despite quite a big dinner."
