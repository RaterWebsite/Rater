      "text": "The Equalizer was one of the most underrated shows of the 1980s, it was a great show, but it always lacked a certain intensity that the lead character needed. In this 2014 film adaptation of the series, Director, Antoine Fuqua, made sure that didn't happen again. Denzel Washington stars and can play anyone, but I find he's at his best when he's playing a dark loner like Robert McCall. McCall, a former CIA operative has retired and is attempting to live a normal life. Everything is going as planned, until he sees a young girl being abused, and decides to take action. McCall believe he's just going up against a local pimp, but discovers it's a lot more complicated than that. Washington continues to be at the top of his game, as the ageless wonder is once again spectacular. This film is everything I loved about the series, with a whole lot more action and intensity. Director, Antoine Fuqua, has been on a role after films like Training Day, Shooter, and Olympus Has Fallen, and he has become THE guy when it comes to action films. Playing off an established franchise and paired with Denzel Washington, The Equalizer has come back to life and is one of the most refreshing action films I've seen in a long time. Sometimes with a different team, what was once old, can become new again, and I was practically jumping out of my seat with excitement. As far as the continuation of the series goes, Fuqua is in the early stages of a sequel. It may not be a new TV series, but it's still something exciting for the fans, and I for one can't wait to see more."

I think that, while it takes a while to take off, when it gets going the story is very compelling, and draws you in. The action sequences are very well thought out, and amazing to watch. The best being the hardware store scene. Not to mention that the soundtrack is superb. Denzel offers a memorable take on the classic in the English series, with a stellar performance. He even packs in some intelligent humour. Overall, this is an action film that will have you hooked until the end."

      "text": "Dark, gritty, outrageous and at times powerful, The Equalizer is certainly a film worth watching. Denzel Washington and Chloe Grace Moretz star in what is a sadly realistic portrayal of the American underworld, particularly focusing on the issue of sex trafficking. The film is at times painful and disturbing to watch, however, it is necessary in presenting an accurate representation of such aspects. Denzel plays his role extremely powerfully, adding to the tense drama with moments of subtle comedic humour and outrageously unnecessary acts of violence. With the addition of well developed antagonists, the film questions our sense of morals expertly."

      "text": "What differentiates a trashy, loudly violent action film from an entertaining, genuine guilty pleasure? If there\u2019s a line, The Equalizer walks on it like an acrobat on a tightrope. Antoine Fuqua\u2019s most recent work establishes itself as a crowd-pleaser, leaving spectators in awe, but every fluctuation between nonsense and coherency creates uneasiness and raises eyebrows. One might think: I hope this guy knows what he\u2019s doing. Fuqua\u2019s previous feature, Olympus Has Fallen (2013), felt like that too: an action packed thriller, forgoing all plot consistency, continuity and common sense for the sake of staging uncontrollable mayhem inside the White House. Since his deservedly acclaimed Training Day (2001), the American director has seemingly found it difficult to keep up with expectations. He has, nonetheless, always had good eye for action scenes, managing to build remarkable and gripping sequences. Much like some of his past works (King Arthur and Brooklyn\u2019s Finest to name but a few), The Equalizer suffers the pains of lacklustre direction. The tasteless use of alarm clock shots to set temporal continuity, or the abundance of dull and redundant digressions, are only a couple of examples. Nevertheless, the film also offers great action, riveting exchanges, and a likeable, cathartic anti-hero.\r Denzel Washington is Robert McCall, our anti-hero, the guy we\u2019d all want in our neighbourhood watch. He tries to lead a normal life, but his past is quite ambiguous, as two minor characters conveniently point out at the very beginning of the film. We\u2019re never quite sure what he used to do for a living, but we soon find out that he\u2019s good at killing people. To compensate for his brute instincts, Robert has developed a form of OCD that forces him to put everything right. He obsessively checks the time, follows a strict routine, aligns surfaces, equalizes things. Self control, though, only lasts until a ruthless syndicate attacks his friend Teri, forcing him to put his skills back to use. Everyone on Robert\u2019s path to justice (better called revenge) then becomes cannon fodder, in a bloody chase between him and the pitiless mobsters.\r If you go see The Equalizer because you like the idea of good ol\u2019 Denzel decimating the bad guys, you will be served, but don\u2019t expect much more than that. There\u2019s little substance beyond the already-held idea of righting all wrongs. There\u2019s very little passion (let alone depth) in the canonical moral messages, clumsily delivered in the banal form of literary quotes. Chloe Grace Moretz and Marton Csokas do a decent job of playing Teri and Russian hired gun Teddy, but Washington outshines both, carrying the whole film on his shoulders with the usual talent. His character comes from an old TV series of the \u201880s, although die-hard fans claim that similarities end there. Washington\u2019s Robert McCall is a half avenger half psychotic hitman, mixing Taken\u2019s Liam Neeson and Unbreakable\u2019s Bruce Willis. He has no real dramatic depth, but we still like him because we like to see the bad guys get beaten up. Whereas Training Day is all about discovering Washington\u2019s Detective Alonzo Harris, appreciating his dark personality by observing his evolving attitude and actions, The Equalizer settles Robert\u2019s background with two lines of dialogue. While Det. Harris is an Oscar-worthy protagonist with a powerful connection with the audience, Robert remains a tool, merely exploited to fuel the action on screen. If you\u2019re planning to watch The Equalizer, prepare for a factitious thriller with unusual dark comedy shades. You\u2019ll spend hours wondering if you liked it or not, before accepting that, in spite of everything, you actually enjoyed it."

But when a young girl gets herself in trouble, his need for justice brings him out of retirement - even if it means going up against a group of dangerous Russian gangsters.\r I always like Denzel Washington in every movie that he was in. He always brings that cocky, smart-ass, know it all kind of person; and The Equalizer is nothing different. Denzel in this movie is a pure bad-ass that will end your life if he had to, just like Liam Neeson from Taken. The villain in this movie is pretty much the same villain that I've seen in every other Russian gangsters mob movies out there. The movie towards they end dragged a little bit for me.\r But overall I still think this movie was entertaining film with a lot of cool stuff with Denzel.

      "text": "I am compelled to write a review about this movie because it struck me near the end that this had a message in it, an important philosophical one. It may appear as a standard action movie to some. Big star role, violence, guns, and explosions may be all this appears. If one pays attention and tries to look closer you will see that the message in the movie may be the same message that the book \"Invisible Man\" by Ralph Ellison was trying to portray. I say this not only because of how the movie was directed, the plot, etc, but I say this also because near the end of the film, the main character (Denzel) was shown with this book. It was zoomed in on to get clear full screen view of the title and author, this of course is of no mistake.\rI looked up the book and it appears to be one of great importance, a classic (1953), has a great message, and has received great awards. My final conclusion for the film is that the director was likely inspired by the \"Invisible Man\" and wanted to tell an interesting story portraying a similar message in a radically different way. From this perspective I believe this movie could be marked down as a future classic with a convincing message that is wonderfully directed. Denzel always does fine work, but this one is really up there. The director also deserves much praise and recognition."

The movie felt kind of aimless, pointless, and unmeaningful IMO (just as Robert's life was portrayed in the film). Robert McCall is just a widowed man living through the motions, not doing much except visiting diners at 2 AM, reading all the books on a list of 100 classic \"must-read\" novels, chatting politely with strangers, helping people out, and keeping his apartment very clean. Robert (and the movie) have no sense of clear direction or purpose. And suddenly comes the one (actually, multiple people/events) destined to send him back into his old ways, and one thing leads to another. Besides exacting brutal justice on helpless goons with his \"very particular set of skills\" and simultaneously leaving lots of very obvious loose ends that are just BOUND to catch up with him, (enforcer & problem-solver/Russian villain) Teddy also impulsively kills for no reason! (He murders a Irish mob boss, which SHOULD start a gang war, but doesn't.)\r There are quite a bit of reckless actions done throughout this movie, and most of them hard to ignore. Besides the aforementioned logical fallacies, its hard to believe that of all the times Robert McCall witnessed injustice in his life (since having faked his own death as a former black ops commando), one random act of violence perpetrated against a stranger makes him go back to his former ways. NOTHING before that ever even slightly tempted him to exact violent and brutal justice? If he could so easily do good (as he takes down baddies and cripples a criminal empire with ease), why hadn't he done it before?\r The film has action and gore, yet even that fails to be entertaining--as Denzel/Robert is far too badass to ever even feel threatened. He seems super-human, which makes it hard for you to connect/relate to him. Victims in the movie don't have enough development to have the audience sympathize with them. As the action is not suspenseful, the plot hard to believe, and the characters underdeveloped/only used to advance the plot, The Equalizer doesn't have much going for it. It's too long and mundane. It doesn't even bring much new material to the table, similarly to Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit. Both do little to establish themselves as different from the many movies out there. The Equalizer is too reminiscent of other vigilante/action films (TAKEN!), and it even reminds me of Home Alone (mostly during the finale)! Denzel's acting style is the only saving grace of the movie.\r Remember the Titans, Man on Fire, and 2 Guns were better Denzel Washington films, and Olympus Has Fallen was a more satisfying product from director Antoine Fuqua. I don't hate \"The Equalizer\", but it was a \"flimsy pretext\" stretched to last two hours and filled with meaningless violence (mostly used to establish the film as grisly and dark). It's a \"rejected Taken plotline\" repurposed to give Sony an unnecessary action movie franchise. This should remain a stand-alone film. It honestly doesn't warrant a sequel. I hate to say this, but \"The Equalizer\" feels like a \"regurgitated cash-grab\".\r I have reviewed 36 other movies, including the 2014 films: The Interview, Exodus: Gods and Kings, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1, Dracula Untold, The Maze Runner, The Expendables 3, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Guardians of the Galaxy, The Giver, Sharknado 2, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Transformers: Age of Extinction, Edge of Tomorrow, X-Men Days of Future Past, Godzilla, Blended, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Divergent, Transcendence, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, The Lego Movie, and more.\r I review TV shows, such as: The Flash, Arrow (Season 3), Gotham, The Last Ship, Sleepy Hollow, Marvel's Agents of SHIELD (Season 1 and 2), The 100, I Wanna Marry Harry, Crisis, Gang Related, and more. I also have reviewed the mobile Android games: Minecraft Pocket Edition, Clash of Clans, and Five Night's at Freddy's.\r (P.S, some of the quotes are from other online text sources.)"

This isn't the first time director Antoine Fuqua and actor Denzel Washington have worked together. Training Day was a film that produced a Best Actor for Denzel, so I was particularly excited for the two reuniting in an action film. However, this ain't your average action film. Fuqua really knows how to direct compelling action with an artistic framework. He's not like other directors who feel the need to unnecessarily shake the camera to hide the atrocious fight choreography and create cheap adrenaline, he actually uses the action to tell the character's story. You learn more about Washington's character through his fighting than you do through his dialogue. The film also had a strong antagonist, played by Marton Csokas, who had as much screen presence as the protagonist himself, which most action films lack, however, like I said before, this ain't your average action film. All that and a riveting action sequence that takes place in a hardware store should be enough to get your blood pumping for days on end."

That is sort of the most unbelievable part of the movie, that this dumpy old bald fart that looks like somebody's dad, could be so agile with Spiderman reflexes.\r If you suspend your disbelief that far, the movie is actually really entertaining because its got that Max Paine, bullet time, stop action effect. The hero is sort of this invincible Flash. Also, the bad guys are a bunch of low life Russian mobster illegal alien pimps, the kind of villain you love to see getting whacked. Luckily, there are goodly supply of them to be terminated. The head villain is an ex-Spetsnatz contract killer psychopath who looks and talks like Kevin Spacey and is oddly named \"Teddy\". Basically it's the return of Kaiser Soze.\r The most annoying thing about the film is all the time spent on \"character buildup\" in which the Equalizer does community service trying to help his loser buddies at Home Depot. Super spy donates charity time to pathetic wannabe security guard. Its just incredibly stupid United Way stuff that just has you taking bathroom breaks until the killing starts again.\r Another oddity of the film is director Fuqua's obsessive cinematography. You always know you are in trouble when the director starts taking control of the camera. There are more shots of Denzel Washington's eyeball than you will ever want to see in your lifetime. You will also get electron microscope closeups of other obscure parts of his anatomy such as his septum, his thenar, etc. In retrospect the overkill on the art shots is not too bad, but it definitely makes the film more \"interesting\" at a certain level.\r Part of the fun of the movie is The Equalizer getting stuck in situations no ordinary person could possibly survive, so you are like, \"I wonder how he is getting out of this one\" and he always has these cool MacGiver solutions to the situation.\r Overall, a pretty entertaining film."

      "text": "The Equalizer was a very disappointing film because it was so uneven \u2013 schmaltzy parts and vicious action and both types of scenes could be boring. The one really interesting thing was the creative ways the villains were dispatched, although The Equalizer was cheating a bit because all his \u201cequalizing \u201cwas done on his home turf. Also I wasn\u2019t quite sure where the director and screenwriter were going with the character (I never saw the TV series.) At one point the Equalizer tells a story to the main villain about an orphan boy who was adopted, and he speculates that the boy ended up killing the people who were kind to him. I thought he was talking about the villain, but someone cleverer than I suggested afterwards that he could just as well have been talking about himself since he had such a talent for unadulterated, sadistic violence. If this subtlety was deliberate, then it was a better movie than I thought. But I still am not impressed. (PS: I am a Denzel Washington fan.)"

That being said it was extremely well done and pretty violent while presenting interesting moral questions. Denzel does a great job as usual and I think the overarching story is pretty cool. I also think the movie does a good job of drawing you in to actually care about some of the lesser characters. Think it is worth a watch for sure!"

      "text": "For all the people that claim the movie's plot is not original enough, it is worth noting that this is based on a tv series that ran from 1985 to 1989. That being said, this remake does what the show took a while to do. The show was campy, the acting was pretty bad, and it was nowhere near as violent as this movie. Denzel Washington did a good job of playing the Black Ops badass in this movie, and I enjoyed when the Russian scumbags pushed his buttons and forced him to act. This movie was entertaining, which is why I go to the movies. If I wanted a cerebral movie about a broken black ops operator, I would watch Man on Fire. This was basically a sequel to Man on Fire with a different character and story. In the end, the girl causes him to snap and do bad things to people who deserve it. Don't have a problem with that, and got good entertainment for what I paid for."

Most of Denzel's movies are really good...just like this one. I wanted to see this movie ever since I saw the trailer. It was better than I thought it was going to be."

      "text": "As generic and 'done-oh-do-many-times-before' as the plot/storyline/premise is - among other minor flaws - , The Equalizer still delivers the goods of a solid and badass Action Thriller. Antoine Fuqua proves that he still has the knack for making great movies. Denzel Washington and Marton Csokas are nothing short of amazing, delivering some brilliant dialogues and performances that definitely try to break the mold of typical characters in likewise movies. The cinematography is (mostly) beautiful, mixing gorgeous views of Boston with moments of solemn slow pace as well as moments that actually push you to hold your breath and expect the unexpected on several occasions.\r As said before, the movie is far from perfect. The pace does tend to be too slow (going as far cas reminding people of the great but often slow \"Drive\"), the camera work becomes sporadic during action scenes, the only Boston accent in the movie is profoundly horrendous (this may be nitpicking, but as a former Bostonian, that one \"attempt\" threw me off), and the bad guys, while portrayed amazingly, are nonetheless your typical mafia members who want to spread chaos when things do not go their way. Finally, the story is not the most original, and may in fact be reminiscent of other slightly better movies.\r But overall, The Equalizer is a great watch and a good time. I look forward to the announced sequel."

      "text": "The Equalizer is a rare breed of movie: it borrows from other films, everything from Sin City to Mr. and Mrs. Smith, yet it manages to be original enough to deserve a high rating. Unlike most generic action flicks, this one has round, multi-dimensional characters who you actually care about, and the script and screenplay are smart and well thought out. The movie is over-the-top and extreme, but it is very entertaining, thanks to smart action sequences and good acting."
