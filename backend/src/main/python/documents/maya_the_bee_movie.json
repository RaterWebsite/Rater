One of these rules is not to trust the hornets that live beyond the meadow. When the Royal Jelly is stolen, the hornets are suspected and Maya is thought to be their accomplice. No one believes that she is the innocent victim and no one will stand by her except for her good-natured and best friend Willy. After a long and eventful journey to the hornets hive Maya and Willy soon discover the true culprit and the two friends finally bond with the other residents of the opulent meadow.", "releaseYear": "2014", "mpaaRating": "G", "imageUrl": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/pMQ88CvnQroSjxk4IhM7YNbcjTx.jpg", "categories": {"plot": 5.0, "acting": 5.0, "ending": 5.0, "soundtrack": 5.0, "cinematography": 5.0, "familyFriendly": 5.0, "funny": 5.0, "action": 5.0}, "reviews": [{"rating": "0", "text": "THIS MOVIE IS A DISGRACE!!!!!!

In my earliest childhood I still remember her but, for the new generations, drenched in Japanese cartoons with weird eyes like \"Dragonball\", \"Pokemon\" and others, it's like talking about Stone Age things.I will not talk about the script. It's so simple that I'm afraid to end up revealing too much. What I can say is that the story is good, has its pretty side and will please the little ones a lot. I was afraid that it would be a movie so much for the younger that it would displease me, that I am no longer a child... but my fear proved to be unfounded. I liked the movie. It's full of clich\u00e9s about finding your own place in the world, but that does not stop us from enjoying the movie for what it is: a children's movie.Problems? The first is the danger of comparisons. It's a relatively low budget film, so it will always lose out compared to similar movies (and we can list many if we think about it) already made by US multi-million dollar studios. The CGI is much more humble, with no desire to appear real and the visuals can really displease those who value the graphic and visual part of the animation; everything is simpler, but it works quite well and, as I value the good quality of the script more than the technical issues, I accepted well the poor CGI used. Another problem with this film is its excessively fast pace. You do not have time to be afraid for that little bee, that is suddenly exposed to the dangers of the world outside the hive... everything happens very quickly and before you realize that she's in danger already she was able to overcome it.Despite the weaknesses, such as the visual and the speed at which everything happens, this is a kid-friendly movie that is easy to swallow for adults."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "It!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
