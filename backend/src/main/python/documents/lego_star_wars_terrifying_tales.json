      "text": "\"Lego Star Wars Terrifying Tales\" (10/1/21, 45-min, Dis+) is a cute, often humorous addition to the Lego Star Wars franchise. The pacing is quick, entertaining and the voicing is really good, too, with the quickly recognizable Dana Snyder as Graballa the Hutt. IIRC, the various \"tales\"  aren't so much separate like an anthology but different chapters of the story."
