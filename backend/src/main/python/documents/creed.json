Creed is a fantastic film on its own, but it is an amazing tribute to the legendary sports film that came before it in Rocky (and, in some ways, its sequels). Michael B Jordan is fantastic, the fighting/training scenes are intense, and,as a whole, the film is extremely well-shot. Overall, this is a superb film that both fans of the Rocky franchise and newcomers can appreciate."

      "text": "Though an imperfect film, Creed is the perfect boxing film. If I were to envision the best possible product of the majesty, mystique, and intensity, brought to the table by boxing, Creed captured it all. From the brilliant walk-out music (the great soundtrack in general), the training, and absolutely stunning fight choreography and cinematography, Creed has it all. The non-boxing parts can feel a bit disjointed at times and then of course it has classic Rocky cheese, but it does enough to honor the original, while going out on its own. Ultimately, the fight for respect faced by Adonis \"Donnie\" Creed is a similar one faced by the film as a whole. Fortunately, it is entirely successful in forging its own legacy thanks to the fantastic direction from Ryan Coogler (I would be hard pressed to name a better new director right now) and phenomenal performances from Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone. Overall, Creed is a great film on its own, but an absolutely phenomenal boxing film."

Jordan straight-up carries the movie for a lot of the running time. The cinematography was superb and the direction and editing on point. Everything gelled. The only things I might have done different are to have given \"Pretty\" Ricky more personality aside from being a trash-talker, and taken a page from \"Southpaw\" and made the fights seem more brutal (not that they don't seem realistic, but that movie took it to a whole other level). I really enjoyed this one and would recommend it to anyone."

In fact, this one didn't either but it was the best option at the time since Spectre didn't have any seats left. I do not regret it. I admired the film's rhythm, the camera work and editing complementing the rest of the film's elements flawlessly that both probably even outshone them. One particular shot that I loved was the Long Take used during his first professional fight. There are very few films I remember pulling off this shot that has made me feel so emotionally engaged. The characters were raw and genuine, no doubt played exceptionally by the cast, particularly, Jordan and Stallone. Some cliches here and there, but it was subtle and weaved in cleverly. The film was well crafted, intense but unhurried, keeping me immersed the entire time. This is the first of Coogler's work that I've seen and I'm looking forward to watching his previous and future films. Well done."

      "text": "Ryan Coogler\u2019s Creed delivers on everything that a great boxing film should, and represents a full return to form for Rocky. Directed by superstar in the making Ryan Coogler, and starring powerful performances from Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone the film is amazing. Creed is exhilarating, beautifully acted, while honoring the previous Rocky films lovingly. The film may be a little too familiar at times, but at least approaches it\u2019s overused plot lines with a different take.\rFrom the opening scene the film captures your attention, showing us a glimpse into who this character is \u201ca fighter.\u201d The film remains an exhilarating journey with this character, who is easy to connect with. As the film progresses, Coogler mixes old techniques like the famous Rocky slow motion sequences, with newer (less used) techniques like very intimate fight sequences, where the camera helps the viewer feel like they\u2019re standing in the ring. The film will draw you in from the moment it starts, to the moment it ends.\rOne reason the film is so exhilarating is the terrific acting of Michael B. Jordan, who leads this journey. Once again teaming up with director Ryan Coogler Jordan anchors the film, and in the process creates a relatable, and human main character. On this note, after seeing \u201cCreed\u201d and \u201cFruitvale Station\u201d I would be willing to make the bold statement that I think Ryan Coogler is on his way to becoming the next Scorsese. All of this being said what may be even more satisfying is seeing Sylvester Stallone return to form as Rocky Balboa.\rSome may criticize the movie for not bringing a lot of original plot lines to the movie, they would be right. However, while not very original the film handles these plot lines from a different perspective. No longer are we watching the nobody rising up against the odds, now we see a man trying to get out of the larger than life shadows of a man he never knew. Those who love the Rocky films recognize the slow motion moments in almost every film, and the iconic way the boxing matches were choreographed. Creed departs from the overuse of slow motion and more adapts the fight choreography of Raging Bull, while still mixing the essence of the Rocky fight scenes.\rThe way Coogler mixes old with new in many different ways helps make the whole film feel like the story it\u2019s telling. Coogler captures the tone of the older Rocky films, while also making a film distinctly different. Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone deliver, and Creed ends up being exactly what fans hoped it would be. In the end if you have the time go see Creed, it\u2019s a terrific 2 hours to spend."

      "text": "Had I not seen \"Fruitvale Station\" I would have thought \"Creed\" would fail. But since I did, I had faith. Turns out \"Creed\" is fantastic. Creed is directed by Ryan Coogler and stars Michael B. Jordan as Adonis Creed, the son of Apollo Creed and Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa. \"Creed\" is a terrific movie. To begin the chemistry between Stallone and Jordan is outstanding. There both witty and it's clear that they both enjoyed creating this film. Furthermore, Coogler fills the film with realism. Sure, there are cliches but what makes this movie stand out is how Coogler uses them. Not to mention there ain't many of them to begin with because Coogler does things differently. This is shown when the main love interest has a hearing problem and will eventually become deaf. It shows how Coogler while trying to make his film similar to the Rocky movies also wants to create something different. Now one of the most impressive parts of this movie is how Coogler shoots the boxing sequences. The best fight is the first fight Adonis fights. Why one may ask? The whole fight is one take. That's right there are no cuts just zooms and lots of movement. It's fantastic because it immerses the viewer in the fight and gets down and dirty as I like to say with the characters. Also, while the second fight is not filmed like this it's interesting enough mostly because there is no clear scene where Creed takes over the fight. The challenger is always fighting back which makes that character feel more human instead of another obstacle. Furthermore, Stallone gives one of his best performances in years. While \"Rocky Balboa\" was a send off for his fighting career this film shows an older broken Rocky who feels as if he has no reason to live. Stallone portrays him with conviction and is one of the best parts of this movie. Overall, even though the final fight should have been filmed like the first one Creed succeeds because of an interesting story, wonderful acting from all the leads and a gritty, real tone which is why I'm giving \"Creed\" a 9 out of 10. See. This. Movie."

Jordan as he delivered a terrific and solid performance, I mean right after \"Fant4stic\" you would think his career has just gone down the drain, it's not until \"Creed\" came to save him.\r The camera work for the fight scenes was excellent, it was inspiring, it had passion and overall it's a great movie."

Speaking of whom, Stallone completely transforms his best known character, coming to us now more like a brooding Marlon Brando antihero, and pulls it off so well that you almost leave the theater without realizing this isn't a Rocky movie. The transformation of Stallone's career, which has taken us all the way from The Lords of Flatbush to the present day, is as much a revelation as the film itself."

Nostalgia comes to mind once this movie starts and remains the entire time, it's a movie that doesn't really bring anything new to boxing movies, you'll get your training montages, emotional moments, and your epic slow motion knock-out punch that seems like each scene is simply ticking the box on the \"how to guide to boxing movies.\" Original? No but entertaining popcorn movie? Yes. Recommended if there's nothing else to watch."

It's a well directed, well paced and very emotional boxing film. Ryan Coogler is a very talented director. He has a very strong attention to detail and emotion just like his last movie \u201cFruitvale Station\u201d. I remember watching that movie and it just made me aggravated about the police and racism. The movie turned me into a radical I wanted to do something about it and Ryan Coogler does not fail to bring that same emotion to screen here. At times the movie can be very heart-breaking and intense especially in the boxing sequences. But, it can also have a light and strong heart bringing hope and cheer to the audience and characters. The only thing I can hope for is that there isn't a Creed 2 because with this movie making 30M and the talk of it in interviews there most likely will be. But, I hope the studios will have the decency to respect the franchise and the fact that there really isn't anywhere to go but down after this movie wraps everything very well. One of the cons I had with the movie was that even though it's formula was somewhat original. It managed to hit almost every cliche in the book and have characters act irrational so that the second act can movie into the third. The movies I enjoy are the ones where the characters don't act completely different and everything is so convenient to the plot so that the movie can movie along. But with all that said I think that this is a pretty solid rocky movie"

Frankly, 'Creed' is one of the best movies I have seen all year - This is for a variety of reasons, lets start with the fact that the direction is expertly crafted. The fight scenes seem so real, it truly feels like I am in the ring with Creed and Rocky themselves when these fights break out. The ending was perfect, it was open-ended (left for a sequel I suppose) and it left a smile on my face. Some bad things are the relationship between creed and a girl seems forced just to have a love interest in the film. Also the 'villain' (if you can call him that) was stupid, It felt like a cartoon and kind of cheapened things up a little bit. Overall 'Creed' is worth watching."

      "text": "YOU can\u2019t keep a good fighter down.\r And while many would have been happy for cinema\u2019s greatest boxer Rocky Balboa to stay down after the surprising success of his self-titled and sixth film nine years ago, you\u2019ll be glad he got back up off the canvas for a seventh round.\r To be fair though, this is not Rocky\u2019s fight. It\u2019s a passing of the torch, or gloves as it were, to Adonis Johnson aka the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed, Rocky\u2019s opponent in the first two films of the series (and friend in the third and fourth).\r \u201cBaby Creed\u201d is played by Michael B Jordan (Chronicle, Fantastic Four), a troubled young man who didn\u2019t know his father but is drawn to Apollo\u2019s legacy and the world of boxing.\r After a promising start to his pugilistic career but with a temper in danger of landing him in trouble, the young Adonis packs in his job as an accountant to follow his boxing dreams.\r He moves from LA to Philadelphia, tracks down Rocky (Stallone, of course) and begins training, hiding the fact he\u2019s Apollo Creed\u2019s son from everyone but Rocky.\r So far, so formulaic, and on paper this looks like an uncalled-for cash-grab; a desperate attempt to restart the franchise. But the reality is this is one of the best films of the Rocky series \u2013 one worthy of the championship belt.\r Creed is filled with the rich history of its predecessors but is not weighed down by it. Perhaps its greatest feat is walking the line between the old and the new \u2013 fans of the series will be well rewarded, but newcomers will find this a great starting point to the saga.\r The film is totally Adonis\u2019, and therefore Jordan\u2019s, but it does a great job of valuing and honouring Rocky, and therefore Stallone.\r Jordan\u2019s performance is great, both in terms of the physicality and the dramatic requirements. He owns a tough role that is constructed almost entirely in the shadows \u2013 not only of his character\u2019s father, but of Stallone, of Balboa, and of the Rocky legacy. That he doesn\u2019t buckle under all that weight while comfortably creating a new character is something to be applauded.\r But the real star of the show is Stallone. A best supporting actor Oscar nomination beckons. After seven films, Rocky is a comfy pair of slippers for him, but in the transition from ageing fighter to \u201cloveable uncle\u201d, he adds new depth and new dimensions to the character that is the best display of Stallone\u2019s talents since Cop Land.\r Coogler, directing his own script, is the quiet achiever here. He gives both Adonis and Rocky good arcs, and you can see the screenplay is the real difference between this being a cheap knock-off and the real deal. But he also handles the action well. The film\u2019s middle fight \u2013 a one-take, two-round sizzler \u2013 is masterfully done, as is the way he builds momentum in the final bout.\r The flaws are few but are really no fault of the film\u2019s. There is nothing truly new here \u2013 no surprise given this is Rocky VII \u2013 and you can spot the story\u2019s beats from a mile away, which takes some of the punch (ahem) out of proceedings.\r There is also a fine line between melodrama and real heart, and which side Creed falls on may well depend on your frame of mind when you step in the ring. Similarly, it\u2019s humourless/serious approach skews toward self-parody, something amplified by the over-the-top and unbelievable nature of the climactic bout.\r But Creed has the potential to win you over if you let it. The injection of new blood, dealt with intelligently, makes for an enjoyable new story in the Rocky saga, aided in no small way by Jordan, Coogler and, dare it be said, a career-best turn from Stallone."

      "text": "Boxing movies usually follow a cliche script or finds ways to just completely ripoff its far superior predecessor (I'm looking at you Southpaw).  Some take stories from real life, while others focus on a down and out person  who pulls himself/herself together to fight for a living. The then come together and become the top of their craft. It gets to the point where the stories get boring. They're predictable, sappy, boring, etc. Creed might steal some cliches from boxing movies or previous rocky movies,  but mostly it throws all the other cliches out the window. This gives audiences a refreshing take on the Boxing genre and a great movie in a long time.\r Both of Adonis Johnson's (Michael B. Jordan) parents weren't around when he was growing up. His aggressive and insurgent nature  has caused him to get a bad-rap in the foster home that he lives in. His life suddenly changed when the wife of Apolo Creed comes in to adopt him. Apolo had cheated on Johnson's mom and left Creed's mom before he was born. He can now lives the life he's always wanted or maybe not. He's always wanted to follow the footsteps of his father without getting there with his name. He meets up with Rocky (Sylevester Stallone) to get him to train him and eventually is able to get into the sport he loves.\r Creed exceeds past its predecessors (besides the first one) because it does a great job of combining both the amazing parts of the Rocky series while giving audiences a new and fresh take. It doesn't want to ride the coattails of the past while still still staying true to the name, and the movie gives us those moments that made the franchise great. This small little awesomeness of irony in the story, is just one of the great things Creed does. Creed the movie doesn't want to be great because of their name while Johnson also doesn't want to get inti boxing because of his name. It's an interesting parallel that really shows us that the director really does get it. He knows what the fans of the series want, while pulling in a new generation of fans.\r The best part of the movie is the acting within the grittiness of the movie. The movie has those amazing corny moments that people love from the last films, but the movie is grittier version of it's predecessor. The acting reflects this as Stallone really shows a broken down version of the once great boxer. His idea of knowing that the past is in fact the past, and he can't cope with leaving the past where it is. Also everything he's loved in life has pasted and gone. His career, his family, and his life has been transformed into something different. Both Jordan and Stallone show their acting chomps as their chemistry is great together. The script helps in this but it's really their performances that make you believe that they're this new family. Stallone gives his best performance, maybe even better than the original Rocky. Michael B. Jordan sells that he is indeed a boxer and the direction of those fights were fantastically put together. The cinematography brings to life the fight scenes and it feels extremely real. The choreography is best since the Fighter.\r The script helps the movie feel real as well. Johnson doesn't all of a sudden become this amazing boxer. It take months for him to train before his first bout. He has boxing all his life in different countries underground. Nothing about the script screams cliche and it doesn't scream for attention. I simply knows what the fans want and it produces that product onto the screen. Bringing back some of the original actors, characters, set pieces, etc., is something not really done anymore. At least not to the quality of this movie. Overall the script prevails without an overabundance of the Rocky formula, while still giving us that Rocky feeling. Also they answer the question of who won during the third fight of Apolo and Rocky.\r Overall, the movie is fantastic. The cinematography shows us the grittiness of Pittsburgh while giving the audience fantastic fight scenes that can rivial any boxing movie. The acting sells us on the script as well, with Jordan and Stallone seeming like they've been acting together for years. This might be the most surprising movie of th year to some as well. Creed is the second  best Rocky movie of all-time and might be the be the best boxing movie since Ragging Bull. 9/10"

Ryan Coogler both writes and directs beautifully by creating new great characters with new stories while also paying tribute to the Rocky films that came before it. Michael B. Jordan is officially a movie star. This kid showed how talented he was with Fruitvale Station and now he's got a role that makes him unavoidable. Sylvester Stallone is back as Rocky and he plays him beautifully. Stallone simply just will never forget how to play him, but he doesn't steal the spotlight either. This film belongs to Jordan and Coogler. The fights are outstanding and truly some of the best fight scenes in all of film.

      "text": "Although nominally part of the Rocky saga, Creed is very much it's own beast. While it deftly acknowledges the previous films, it is unequivocally Adonis Creed's story and Rocky Balboa is a supporting character. Fortunately, this means that a detailed knowledge of the previous Rocky films is not necessary and the film can easily be enjoyed on its own merits.\r The story rests firmly on the relationship between Michael B. Jordan's eager, ambitious Adonis Creed and Sylvester Stallone's Rocky, and the chemistry between the actors is the films greatest strength; Creed is a young man in need of a mentor and father figure, while Rocky is a lonely, ageing man in need of a purpose, and it is the evolution of their relationship that forms the emotional heart of the film. Both actors perform strongly, with Stallone's turn as the ageing, directionless former champion of particular note (surely Oscar nomination worthy).\r There are some extremely well shot fight sequences, particularly the one take boxing match, and the way it reinterprets classic sequences is very enjoyable for those familiar with the originals.\r Overall, Creed is a thoughtfully made, skilfully acted, and highly enjoyable film that ends up being much more than simply a \"boxing movie\"."

Jordan as Adonis Johnson the son of Apollo Creed,Sylvester Stallone returning to play Rocky Balboa and Tessa Thompson as Bianca.\rCreed follows Adonis Johnson,who's father (Apollo Creed) died before he was born.However he loves to box and one day he decides to seek out Rocky Balboa to train him.Rocky sees Apollo in Adonis and agrees to train him,even though he battles a deadly opponent but with Rocky's help he will train and try to make a name for himself not just depend on his father's.\rThis movies,much like Rocky (1976),it's not concentrated on the boxing as much as in the characters.Adonis Johnson is played wonderfully by Michael B. Jordan who is definitely Oscar worthy with this performance.Adonis is trying to prove that he was not just a mistake and show the world that he can fight.He goes through a lot of struggle but with the help of Rocky he will try to overcome his fears and be better at what he does.\rSylvester Stallone is magnificent on the iconic role again.He proves that The Expendables it's not all he does and he is worthy of a lot more.\rOne of the first professional fights on the ring that Adonis has it's been made to look as one-shot take and it's brilliant.I really loved that scene and even more than the final battle.\rI really like the personal struggles that the characters have to go through,the way they overcome them and the dialogue between the two main characters it's really good and sometimes even touching.I was tearing up in a few scenes and the amazing soundtrack coordinating with the lines of the dialogue made for some pretty intense/sad scenes.\rI really liked Creed,it's certainly one of the best movies of the year and worthy of many awards."

While there are moments in the movie, like Rocky's cancer, the quality of opponents, and the relative ease that he becomes a \"good\" fighter, the ending is very satisfying. The challenge with most boxing movies is it literally comes down to a single event, so there's a 50-50 chance it will end in a way that you expected, fortunately they chose a different path. With the loss at the end, but a loss that shows his potential, the movie shows that it isn't above it's own myth creation and lives in the, somewhat, real world.\r Great to see in the theaters or as a Netflix night."

Suprisingly,Stallone is in his element again after an eternity.It may not reinvent the genre but it revitalizes it.Well defined characters and relationships feel organic.Character traits are embellishments and not afterthoughts. Characters themselves fit into existing templates,while staying true to their established traits.Nothing feels forced out of place,but at the same time,it feels new.The audience is part of every fight,flowing with every jab and floating with every dodge,seamlessly shot.A few cliched framing devices in the third act notwithstanding,Hollywood has a bona fide movie star in Micheal B Jordan and a stellar director in Ryan Coogler.Along with FRUITVALE STATION,this pair is fighting 2-0-0.JJ Abrams and Colin Trevrrow should take notes."

Originally thinking the last thing the cinema world needed was yet another Rocky flick, I was blown away by how good this movie is.  Although the viewer benefits if they know the first three movies, the story is compelling enough to stand on its own.  Both Jordan (no surprise) and Stallone give top notch performances.  In fact, Stallone's is so nuanced as an old guy who knows he's an old guy, that he absolutely earns his Oscar nomination.  Although the final fight scene, just like in all the Rocky flicks, drags on and is unrealistic, the movie wins one over with its heart and performances.  Good job!"

Beautiful story-telling and utilizes all the elements that made the original Rocky magic. Minus half a point for Michael B Jordan, who lacks the depth and vulnerability of Stallone, but has a made a giant leap from Fruitvale Station. The other half point deduction is the paper thin motivation the young Creed has to become the worlds greatest champion. Neither of these points gets in the way of enjoying the movie, and Stallone is a joy to watch, as always.\rAll in all, about as good as Rocky II, which is saying a lot."

      "text": "Outside of the original 1976 Rocky film, the Rocky franchise consists of some decent films but none can hold a candle to the original film which still holds up today nearly 40 years since it's release, however Creed is a very good film and earns the spot of the second best movie in the entire franchise. The film does so many things right, the gym politics between fighters is an interesting angle, the boxing choreography is the best the series has ever seen but still not at Raging Bull's (one of my favorite films notwithstanding sports or boxing movies genre) level of realism and accuracy of how boxing matches actually happen. The acting is phenomenal, Michael B Jordan will be a heavyweight (boxing puns!) in Hollywood in a few years, Sylvester Stallone however surprised a lot of people with a very touching and emotional portrayal of a man who has lost his family and is just waiting for death. Stallone's performance didn't surprise me because I have always known in certain situations this guy can deliver, watch the original Rocky movie, the guy was nominated for an Oscar, he absolutely deserved that nomination, there is more to him than Expendables franchise.\r I would recommend everyone to check this out, as much as I liked this film I have to admit that it will not reach the iconic status of the original Rocky film. Primarily because the film had a few missteps in the editing department, the first half could have been shorter by 15 minutes or so, it was trying to be a cool funny film for everybody but I was glad that it ditched all that for intense heavy emotional drama in the second half. Another minor nitpick I have is I never felt as invested in the relationship of Adonis and Bianca compared to Rocky and Adrian, these films aren't about romance though so it's not a big deal. Further, I found Adonis Creed to be a lot like Apollo Creed smart, intelligent and charismatic, which is great and all but I prefer Rocky as the protagonist because he was a blue collared simple man who was not good with words but always got up after being knocked down."

I am not a hardcore Rocky fan.  I've probably seen 2 of the whole series.  From that perspective I still thoroughly enjoyed watching CREED.  CREED is great entertainment and is definitely a new school classic.  Cooglers use of the camera in storytelling really puts the viewer right in the middle of the action.  CREED wasn't even a choice on my \"to watch\" list, but I am glad that our group decided on this movie.  Fresh and relevant, with very convincing performances from the whole cast, CREED delivers a surprise left hook out of nowhere!  CREED runs 2+ hours long but felt half that because of the wonderful flow of the movie.  Jordan's performance as a professional boxer was impressive, and Stallone's aging Rocky was pure class.  Kudos to them both.  Go watch this movie."

Jordan is introduced as Apollo Creed's illegitimate son Adonis \"Donnie\" Creed (who was born after his father died in the ring, in order to make him just about young enough to 'be' an up and coming fighter) who decides to leave his pretty decent life behind in California and head to Philadelphia as a way to find out who he really is.\rRocky is now effectively alone, the characters introduced in Rocky Balboa who offered some emotional context have apparently disappeared, and Paulie has died in the interim too. Rocky and Donnie form a bond after Rocky, who is immediately dismissive of getting back into the training game, has a pretty impressive change of heart and begins to get Donnie into better shape.\rDonnie's love interest, Bianca is shoe-horned in after they meet because she lives in the apartment below, and plays music too loudly... Cue awkwardness that blossoms into love/hate/love as the plot requires.\rDonnie is offered the chance to fight the undefeated, undisputed, light-heavyweight champ because of extraneous circumstances that for some reason make an unknown 'Creed' a better money making prospect that the number one contender... (Yes, that made no sense to me either!) Culminating in a beat by beat cover version of Rocky's first fight with Apollo (and, sadly, does set up a potential sequel).\rAlong the way we discover a little about Donnie's motivations, Rocky's difficulties with being alone, and the parallel 'internal' fights of both men as they battle to overcome their fears (of different things, for different reasons).\rAll in all it's just highly derivative and a completely unnecessary film. As mentioned, the finale of Rocky Balboa was the perfect ending to what was then a 30 year franchise. Now, coming up on 40 years since we first saw Rocky climb out of the ring after beating 'Spider', lighting a cigarette, and heading home... We're left with a bad aftertaste with the final mouthful, despite some great acting on Stallone's part, because seeing this film only reminded me just how fresh and exciting the original Rocky film (that Creed desperately attempts to emulate) actually was.\r Immensely disappointing."

Other than that, this was a great and fun film that left me satisfied for the most part, yet wanting more (possibly a sequel) at the same time."
