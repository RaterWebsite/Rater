Despite this and other differences, including that she's rich, he's poor, and she's a city girl, he's a country boy, the two become fast friends. Together, they create Terabithia, a land of monsters, trolls, ogres, and giants and rule as king and queen.",

      "text": "This film was just okay. I vaguely remember reading this book as a child, and so I couldn't quite remember a lot of the little details. Anna Sophia Robb was the greatest part of this film. She was incredibly engaging. It made me wish that the film was centered around her character instead of the boy and his complete and utter lack of a personality. The little girl that played his sister was cute, and added some nice touches to the movie. Zooey Deschanel was good, but there wasn't much for her to do in the part. The CG stuff in the film made me feel sometimes that I was watching two entirely different movies as it would switch between fantasy and reality. I think the film had the potential to be a lot more moving. There were many times where the dialogue made me cringe, and other times that the acting, by most of the cast, produced the same effect. T2 villain and David Duchovny replacement, Robert Patrick, played a father that was a little too over the top with his discouragement of his son's imagination. Every time Anna Sophia was not on the screen, I would lose interest. She was very good, despite having to deliver some ridiculous lines at times. I really was sad when her character died, even though I knew it was coming. If you like cheesy, family fare, then you'll love this movie. If that stuff bugs the s*** out of you, you'll hate the movie."

Josh Hutcherson was a great Jess, Annasophia Robb was a perfect Leslie, Bailee Madison was a cute Maybel, Zooey Dushenel was an good teacher. I think the creativity and imagination put into this book and then film was inspiring and a great family film. The ending was very sad and I felt for Jess. The was Josh showed us how Jess was feeling was incredible and more than I expected! Overall a lovely film and perfect for a family get together!"

      "text": "Perhaps the single most heart wrenching movie I have ever seen. Let me say this: Pan's Labyrinth was a masterpiece, and delved into the depths of a young child's heart and mind using an astounding mixture of connecting metaphors and a scary journey in juxtaposition to an even scarier world. It was truly saddening, because it had to be. It explained it's sadness in a way that can be traced through it's own tale. That said, Bridge to Terabithia manifests within the soul a more profound (indeed, THE most profound) sadness, one which I have only felt when those closest to me have passed on. Never in my life has art created something that saddens me and eludes an answer. Pan's Labyrinth's answer is traceable; Terabithia's lies beyond my mind's ability to explain, perhaps because it is so real, so alone, so transcendental. What I can say is that it is in one perspective ironic that I am saddened by those who cannot feel this way because they have forgotten what it was like to once possess an open mind, like a child's. A cynical layer of myself would say it's too childish and can be seen through. But the truth elicited in Terabithia shows that each layer is at once important and ridiculous, and underneath this lies what a true open mind is: one that is not afraid to admit that everyone must be right, that everyone must be wrong, that for now, this is all complete garbage. This is beautifully perfect."

Quite sad in the end, but a great moral message is delivered which made this movie a classic fairytale/coming of age story that will be remembered for a long long time."

I will warn you though, it is a very sad movie, lite hearted in the beginning, but very serious towards the end. I wouldn't have my kids watch this one until they were a bit older. This movie literally left me feeling a bit depressed, which is a testament to the acting and scripting. If you are looking for a solid drama, with some fun thrown in that will most certainly stir some emotion, check this one out."

Yes I know, it is a movie about loss, guilt, the end of childhood and the cruelty of reality. But this movie is downright BORING, the first 30 minutes nothing happens and after that it is just two kids running through the woods and using their imagination. There is no plot, no relevant storyarc, no suspense. [Spoiler] It's just one hour of character-build-up and then they are killing one character off screen, so the other main character can grieve for the last half hour. I mean the story HAS some heartbreaking-potential, but this plot twist isn't worth the 90 minutes you need to sit through them."

I sit down to watch this on Disney Channel, expecting what i've described in the first paragraph, and what do I get?

The people who complain about the movie's last third should--and please forgive me--grow up. Yes, it is SAD. Tragedy IS tragic. Why shouldn't a movie mirror life and show that growth--even happiness--can come from loss?! That's what art does; it reflects life in all its complexity. Well worth seeing and, with any luck, will become a classic touchstone film in the genre."

As you watch Leslie, so stylish and perky, you wonder why no middle school boy(including Jessie) is attracted to her. Robbs is like Winona Ryder in \"Welcome Home, Roxy Carmichael\", because a misfit; a true misfit, shouldn't be cute as a button. In 1978(the year Katherine Paterson won her Newberry Award), a teacher could still drive a lone male student to the museum for some extra-cirricular enrichment. But since the film is contemporary(all those teacher-student scandals), you have to wonder what the filmmakers were thinking. That said, \"Bridge to Terabithia\" still delivers an emotional punch. I remember the book well. I remember the shock. You feel Jessie's loss, but because it's a Disney production, the film ends on a false happy note. You just know that Jessie(Joss Hutcherson) will be in therapy for the rest of his natural life."

If Disney didn't have faith in the movie, they shouldn't have made it. I can't belief the company that made this wonderful movie is the same company that advertised it in such a misleading way. This movie reveals what a greedy selfish company Disney is these days. I miss those days when Disney were happy to provide us wih quality movie. Now Disney's become one of those stupid major company that wants nothing but money! Anyway the movie was great. No part of it felt boring. The children's acting looked so real (unlike the girl from the Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl, her acting was totally fake.) I wonder if AnnaSophie Robb is really anything like the character she plays. Anyway, when I went to watch the movie I had already read the book. I was kind of confused when I saw the trailers, but the movie did turn out to be loyal to the book. It even added a little to the book. When I took my older brother (who's kind of into fantasy stuff) to see this movie, I didn't tell him what the movie was about. His reaction was so funny. Anyway if you're sick of those fantasy movies that are all the same (eg. Narnia, The Never Ending Story) this is certainly the movie for you. The occastional action sequences are average, but the magical the story was told will blow you away. If you don't like this movie you clearly don't have the ability to feel love and pain. In other words go see this movie. If you can tink deeply about things you'll love it."

While some of the difficulties faced by youngsters growing up is somewhat accurately portrayed, the never-ending doom is depressing beyond words.

Loved the story, loved the fact that the screenplay stayed true to the novel and was not sugar coated in any way. The best part of the movie experience was the shocked silence from the 6-7 10 y/o boys sitting behind us during the latter half of the movie, that had upto that point been yammering on about special effects and were probably of the mindset of our two critics mentioned above."

The effects are used sparingly but they're pretty nice and imaginative, with some awesome creatures and a couple nice action scenes.

I'm not saying they couldn't do that ending, I just wish they'd taken the time to not have it feel so random.
