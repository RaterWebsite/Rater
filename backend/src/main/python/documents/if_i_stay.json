Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz is a good actress and will have a great career, but the guy in the movie can't act for his life.\r The one good thing about this movie (and I mean the only one whatsoever) was the cello repertoire. As a cellist, I can say that Mia's fingerings on the cello and the way she played were technically right (which is surprising for a movie like this), and the pieces played in the movie were very prestigious and nice to listen to.\r Overall, this movie was tedious, cheesy, and clich\u00e9d to the max, and even the girl I went with hated it. That's saying something.

It was all around horrible."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "If I Stay is very sentimental in its themes about family relationships which makes it heartbreaking yet engaging but for the main ideal relationship between the two-star cross lovers (Chloe Moretz and Jamie Blackley), their love for each other seems to be incoherent and yet forced especially the ending part. Its not all that satisfying towards their relationship but at least it gave me tears for the parts when Mia's (Chloe Moretz) parents died in the accident. And one other thing is that; (I don't know if many people agree with me in this one)nwhy the movie showed first the accident scene before the past scenes where Mia meets the boy, and then knowing that her parents are rock music lovers. I don't think it should be that order of appearance, -- its a little rip off to know the life of the people who died in the accident. Overall, If I Stay is sometimes sweet, less funny, and an incoherent piece of melodrama aimed for the young and old."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Sometimes in life you make choices and sometimes choices make you.\u201d\r Adapted from Gayle Forman\u2019s popular young adult novel of the same name, If I Stay hinges on choices and is quick to spell out this message to its audience. Protagonist Mia (Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz) and her family are involved in a massive car wreck early into the film and she finds herself in a state of limbo, forced to watch in horror as she becomes an orphan overnight.\r The film alternates between the past and present, filling in the gaps of Mia\u2019s life up until the accident. The past shows Mia\u2019s as a budding cellist with some series talent, hailing from a family of rock music enthusiasts. As a result she has always doubted her talent and questioned her place within the family; enter Adam, an ambitious musician played by Jamie Blackley. Adam is the type of gorgeous, charming, too-good-to-be true love interest that only ever exists in fiction. It takes a fair amount of coaxing from both Adam and her parents (delightfully played by Mireille Enos and Joshua Leonard) before she finally gives into them. Only a few short scenes later and they\u2019re declaring their undying love and doing it in a shed. So sweet. Things begin to go pear-shaped for the couple when Mia considers pursuing her musical dreams and attending Julliard rather than remaining in Portland with Adam.\r The present is significantly less interesting. A large chunk of the film is Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz running around a hospital with a look of intense bewilderment on her face while her remaining loved ones and an ICU nurse keep pleading with her unconscious body to fight for her life. Therein lies the crux of the story; should Mia stay and fight for a life that doesn\u2019t include her family? Or end it all and keep from feeling the brunt of that pain for the rest of her life?\r Unfortunately several members of the cast (including Moretz) seem to be suffering from a serious bout of overacting. This isn\u2019t entirely Moretz\u2019s fault, she isn\u2019t given a whole lot to begin with. Apart from the incredible cello playing, Mia is a rather bland protagonist whose sole personality trait seems to be that she\u2019s insecure. Yes, that comes with the territory of being a teenager, but how this girl has such low self-confidence is beyond me. Her parents have been encouraging and supporting her for her entire life. She has a great friend who always has her back and a boyfriend who is totally besotted with her. This, not the fact that a person can have control over whether live or die, is the biggest stretch of If I Stay.\rhe film isn\u2019t without its merits, however. Even though Mia\u2019s interactions with Adam lapse almost too far into sentimentality, the scenes she shares with her grandfather (Stacy Keach) are among the film\u2019s best. He is her biggest supporter outside of her immediate family, and his respect for her musical talent is quite touching. I did get a little teary despite myself during his heartfelt speech at Mia\u2019s bedside as he tells her he will understand if she doesn\u2019t have it in her to fight anymore.\r While there are a number of scenes to enjoy, I can\u2019t help but feel like I was cheated out of a more compelling story \u2013 the one where a girl copes in life after the death of her family. But hey, I hear there\u2019s a second book, perhaps I\u2019ll see some of you for the sequel."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Why, Chloe Grace Moretz  enjoy making horrible movies with terrible production value?

It was advertised very well on TV but when I went to see it with my mum we were both very disappointed. It was awful. There was no story arc. Chole Mortez's character just stayed the same through out the film -- no character development. She just ran around the hospital looking pretty. The secondary characters (her friend, little brother parents) had more character development then her and where frankly much more interesting. It was way too long. Some parts of the film could of been cut out as a lot of the scenes where too prolonged and dull. I found myself getting very bored. If I was Gayle Forman (the author of the book) I would of been very disappointed with the film."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "mmmmm.................................................................................................................................................................................."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "This movie is bad. Very, very bad. It proves once again that movies mad from young adult books are not meant for anyone, of any age who considers themselves to be adult. Chloe Grace Moretz is marvellous, as she usually is, particularly in the cello playing scenes. That being said...the flick is maudlin, contrived, tear jerking schmaltz. Chloe did not deserve to have this movie thrust upon her."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Many will hate If I Stay because it is, well, very much a chick flick at times. But, even as a guy, I managed to enjoy this one on varying levels. At times, the romance was very, very cheesy. It was over the top and felt very unrealistic. On top of that, this one can be incredibly melodramatic. However, in saying that, there are many redeeming qualities for If I Stay that I truly feel outweigh the negative. For one, Chloe Grace Moretz is great. She oddly cannot seem to cry, sure, but she was very good. On top of that, this one got me to cry just a little bit at times, which was not what I expected at all. While a lot of it felt very authentic romance wise, emotionally, this one was on point and certainly did a great job there and managed to wind up being a very touching film. The script is also fine, not great, but it got the job done and the cinematography worked well for the most part with some good and some bad. The music is also very good on this one and really completed the film nicely. However, the real reason why I like this one is  because of the supernatural element here regarding death. Death fascinates me and this one had a very interesting twist on the whole idea of death, which certainly piqued my interest in that regard. While If I Stay is far off from an Oscar winner, it is a fine film that does not deserve the amount of hatred it has received from some."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Went in to this movie not expecting anything special. Knew the plot from the trailer - girl gets in accident while in a romantic relationship.

Really good line, I'll have to remember that next time I need it.\rOther than the flashbacks (to a high-school relationship) and flash-forwards (to the present-day hospital room), really relate-able movie. \"High school relationships are the most inconvenient to try and sustain.

This is my big problem with these teen romance movies, and that is with it's force romance that goes nowhere with the main two love birds of the film. Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz did good in the movie but this movie tries to be like the fault in our stars and fails hard.
