The special effects are great, which is expected by the big budget they had.Jason Statham is very good in it, he's character is actually has a better characterization than i expected, unfortunately other characters don't get the same privilege, making the deaths not sink in. I liked dynamic between Jason Statham and this little girl character \"Meying\".They tried forcing a romance in their, but it just distracted me from the real action, because it was totally out of place. Amongst all that, the movie didn't take itself too seriously, it was quite funny, which i can appreciate. When Jason Statham stabs the Meg's eye, was just that awesome Jason Statham moment every movie of his needs to have. Overall a good watch"

And it was enjoyable, especially the last 20 minutes. Which shouldn\u2019t be surprising the film swept at the box office and lives up to the concept of Statham fighting a 2.6 million year old, thought to be extinct shark. Just don\u2019t be surprised if this becomes a meme in a few years.The movie literally ends with a Thai version of \u2018\u2019Hey Mickey you\u2019re so fine\u2019.Still, \u2018The Meg\u2019 was a lot of fun. Is it going to change cinema forever or give you a unique experience? Not really. It\u2019s one of the dumbest movies of 2018, and yet, you can find some enjoyment out of it. You can even laugh at the corny scenes which was meant to be taken seriously. However, if I have to critique, I will gladly do so.This movie lacks balance in tone and knowing what it\u2019s trying to be. There\u2019s horror elements when the Megalodon attacks. There\u2019s comedic elements that stops it from being gloomy. There\u2019s dumb popcorn fluff to keep things vibrant. And there\u2019s suspense when the shark is near. All tones mashed together with uneven results. I didn\u2019t find any of the humor that funny and the only time I chuckled was something unintentional.The amount of charm Statham brings to the character already makes his presence likable. Too bad they didn\u2019t give him any memorable one liners. You could pick out lines like \u201cChomp on this you ugly bastard.\u201d, or \u201cMy god, it\u2019s a Megalodon\u201d - those are alright, although nothing will top \u201cSmile you son of a b-\u201d.Every time there\u2019s a death scene or somebody is going to die, it\u2019s telegraphed and obvious. Supporting characters with very little screen time - They goners. Also, I\u2019ve haven\u2019t seen Masi Oka in anything for awhile and I was surprised to see him here. Loved him in \u2018Heroes\u2019. Man, they did him wrong here.The CGI is OK, some of the acting wasn\u2019t that good, and the overall experience feels like a water down blood-fest.Jon Turteltaub (the director) openly said the original cut was brutal and \"Horrifying, Disgusting\". In interviews, Turteltaub expressed his disappointment that we won\u2019t see this cut in cinemas. Which makes me wonder what the original cut was like, not just in violence, but how terrifying it might be. Will it add anything? Who knows. Could have taken an enjoyable dumb film into a bloody good time. Perhaps this generations \u201cDeep Blue Sea\u201d.Overall Rating: Fin"

      "text": "Unfortunately The Meg isn't so bad it's good. It's just so bad it's bad. Believe it or not I had a certain expectation for The Meg. Yes I know it's a Jason Statham movie about a deep sea submersible which has been attacked by a 75 foot pre-historic shark previously thought to be extinct. I know it's not going to be a masterpiece. I went to laugh and be entertained and well if it also featured Jason Statham punching Megalodon then that's just a bonus.\u00a0Damn Jason you let me down again. I didn't expect much, but as far as bad monster movies go The Meg is definitely lacking.Mana One, a multi-million dollar undersea observation program send a crew down to what was previously believed to be the ocean's lowest point. But wait, it turns out it's just a freezing cold cloud concealing an entire new ocean beneath it. Completely unexplored and just so happens to be home to the Megalodon. With the crew trapped down there there's only one man to call apparently, and that man is none other than Jonas Taylor (Jason Statham). With time running out Jonas must confront his fears and rescue the crew from this massive shark.It didn't quite reach the \"so bad it's good\" category and honestly took itself way too seriously. I expected a massive shark to spend the majority of the movie chomping on everything and everyone. That's all I wanted, not too much to ask really. You get exactly what's advertised only less, ultimately The Meg did not have to try this hard. It's a movie about a giant pre-historic shark. It's ridiculous and should have played into that a lot more. Go big or go home, it needed more black comedy and less attempts at adding depth to the characters. The attempt at creating a serious shark movie is just not working when you have wooden actors and no script.\u00a0I'm not going to compare it to Jaws because Jaws is in another league. Yet you will definitely be reminded of Jaws as The Meg just couldn't resist the temptation to pay homage to Jaws at every opportunity. There are so many bad shark movies out there you could do worse than The Meg, but then again it's not as fun as it should have been either. Maybe if it had an R rating, took itself less seriously and had more people being eaten it might have been better but I guess we'll never know. Although it made it's money back so don't be surprised if The Meg two comes along in a couple of years. So if you're the type of person who finds Deep Blue Sea or Jaws: The Revenge hilarious then be sure to check out The Meg, just make sure to go into it with zero expectations and leave your brain at home."

      "text": "I\u2019m not able to watch The Meg without thinking of Jaws and I\u2019m glad an individual sitting next to me reminds of the film Deep Blue Sea at the end of the film (The Meg). To me, The Meg is like the diverse-futuristic-inclusive Jaws though lacks the extreme effort set in the story telling of Jaws. I recently got to watch Jaws and I literally would not take my eyes off the screen from the very beginning of the film to the end. Both films, The Meg and Jaws, introduce their primary menace early on\u200a\u2014\u200abut\u200a\u2014\u200aJaws creates more than one menace beyond the threats in the water. Jaws brings the audience to render the situations of the town as is and sets an importance on the beach for the town. There\u2019s an entirely different set of circumstances which the audience has to not only recognize but deal with. It\u2019s one thing to think about dead family members and friends. It\u2019s an even more serious matter thinking of the livelihoods of an entire town\u200a\u2014\u200athe economy\u200a\u2014\u200aand long-term functions that rely heavily on a season\u2019s production in conjunction with deaths, publicity, and responsibilities\u200a\u2014\u200aresponsible persons. My goodness. The Meg throws a huge number at everyone about a station that only really seems to affect only so many people in a particular area and industry. I\u2019m not knocking The Meg as a thriller film\u200a\u2014\u200abut there\u2019s no way to ignore its potentially greatest influence Jaws.So, I\u2019m going to discuss a few similar aspects that take very different routes of exploration. Let\u2019s talk social. The Meg sets its social tone in a limiting way which Jaws explores way further. Jaws doesn\u2019t simply throw out a large number then mention life being about sex, money, respect, and power (which I find to be a very lazy-overloaded-underspecified-vague term). The audience has to walk through the ins and outs of the town\u2019s circumstances in Jaws and really has to set themselves in the shoes of many of the people in the film. What do you do as the mayor or sheriff of a town in need? That\u2019s an initial question then the rest of the questions come concerning economy and safety which become of the greatest concerns of all parties able to affect change.There\u2019s no way to avoid talking about intelligence. I like the mini shark lessons throughout Jaws which develop as the plans adjust. The Meg doesn\u2019t really coerce me into believing any of the acting partners are actually knowledgeable about their circumstances. Realistically, the audience is thrown into scenarios with acting partners either claiming to be all knowing of their circumstances or having been set in a position as all knowing of their circumstances. Jaws leads scenarios so well. There are so many moments of solidification which back up the character types set in Jaws. The Meg has really nice facilities and looks good. I always feel like technology can never really look smarter than its developers or users\u200a\u2014\u200ano matter how flashy it may look. Why cost so much looking good\u200a\u2014\u200aif it doesn\u2019t work so well? I\u2019m into future developments but don\u2019t force technological-self-autonomy on me until auto-correct is flawless. This might seem like a random rant\u200a\u2014\u200abut, I assure you, it\u2019s not. In Jaws, technology comes as an extension of the specialists\u2019 knowledge and necessities. In The Meg, technology is present as a necessity which allows for specialists to delve into and encounter that which is fully unknown. In Jaws, the specialists are always analyzing bits to ensure to know as much as possible before their delve into any scenarios involving the sharks. Why wouldn\u2019t the specialists in The Meg properly analyze every bit of the cloud with a machine from that billion dollar station so as to ensure proper safety parameters were set instead of relying completely on technological specs that were crushed? Why wouldn\u2019t the specialists secure their vehicles properly to ensure their swift mobility out of any potentially dangerous situations? Precautions aren\u2019t meant to be taken post dive. Live to explore another day with more intelligence and better research. My goodness.I\u2019m going to take some time to appreciate the camera angles of Jaws. Cinematography really makes a film more effective. Jaws makes me feel like more matters than a complete movie; Jaws forces me to acknowledge all that is within the film as though constantly waving away the idea that I\u2019m even watching a film. When I\u2019m watching Jaws, I constantly feel like I\u2019m receiving reminders that there is something more important going on here\u200a\u2014\u200alook! When I\u2019m watching The Meg, I\u2019m more like\u200a\u2014\u200aWhat\u2019s going to happen next?! / What time is it?Overall Grade: C-/C\u2014 K.D.If you\u2019re into Poetry and other bits of creativity, check out my Instagram: @Dufreshest."

And to make up with the severe lack of sharks in this movie, We are treated to a generic plot with some pretty poor over-acting by the cast.

It's outlandishly silly in concept and execution and threatens to buckle under the weight of any outside logic applied. But this is precisely part of what makes the film so fun - it's not trying to be the next Citizen Kane, but rather one that is as knowingly ridiculous as it is brainless, a movie that you can simply pop over to for some decent scares as well as laughs and action (courtesy of Jon Turtletaub, director of the equally ludicrous \"National Treasure\" films). The cast - including Rainn Wilson, Li Bingbing, Ruby Rose, and Page Kennedy as the typical assortment of stereotypes that come along within this sort of movie - is likable, and leading man Jason Statham channels both his typical stone-faced action hero schtick as well as some of the same comedic timing and wit that made him so surprisingly funny in Melissa McCarthy's \"Spy\" to give us one of his best performances in recent memories.True, fun as it may be, the film is riddled with cliches, many of the side-stories are underbaked, and the movie doesn't quite go as far off the deep end as you may hope, but it's almost exactly the best that one could ever hope for from a film that's like a big-budget Syfy Original movie with better writing, directing, acting, special effects and, well...basically everything. For me, that's more than enough - I'll take this over \"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom\" any day."

The Meg was very self-aware with it's ridiculous clich\u00e9 characters and absolutely insanely stupid moments throughout but remained a visual feast for the eyes when we were witness to such a lush and wondrous underwater atmosphere with a behemoth prehistoric shark stalking its prey. The characters were constantly annoying and somewhat abhorrent especially the token black guy which was especially bad. A lot of the humor fell pretty flat most of the time but Statham remained a constant decent protagonist. When the shark is sparingly shown the CGI was very well done and it looks fantastic, but for once again being the main spectacle we barely get to see him it seems like. Instead we see many different useless scenes and attempts at tone shifts into more emotional aspects of the ridiculous characters . Also the violence and brutality was definitely toned down for this PG-13 cut and I think this movie would've benefited vastly from the original R-rated cut that was turned down by the studios. The finale worked solidly and was decently satisfying but overall this was at best a good yet utterly ridiculous short film that doesn't really separate itself from anything That's come before. The production value was very solid but for 150 million I would hope it would be. I definitely enjoyed the mana one underwater station lighting and design as well as some vast colorful underwater set pieces. I still think as far as new age shark films go that The Shallows and 47 meters down were slightly better. If you're a fan of sharks and just plain ridiculous spectacles, see this, just know what you're getting into and don't expect Jaws."

      "text": "Don't expect a more serious film like Jaws, The Abyss, or the original book. This is a popcorn film. It's directed by Joh Tuteltaub who directed National Treasure and The Sorcerer's Apprentice and has a similar feel. There are also some script issues. (Rainn Wilson's rich boss has some good lines but either the writer or actor seemed to have trouble with making him feel consistent. Page Kennedy appears to be straight man only to suddenly become the comical relief two-thirds in.) Still, although this is a lightweight film, its appeal.The characters are likable and mostly understandable, and the actors all seem to be having a nice time. Special credit should be given to Shuya Sophia Cai who is remarkably good for a child actress.Besides the film has a giant shark, and it is hard not to entertain with it. Although PG-13, I felt the violence was done pretty effectively under the restraints. There are a few pretty tense and eye-catching moments here. The final shark fight is completely unbelievable, but man is it fun to watch in how over-the-top it is. Overall, the film isn't deep but a lot of fun."

Without going into the spoiler section so quickly just know if you like B+ or B movies or summer blockbusters or maybe want to see a hardcore yet still softie Jason then this film is perfect for you. If you had an inclination of watching this act on it. Just don\u2019t do IMAX It isn\u2019t worth the extra bit for IMAX. Shuya Sophia Cai playing Meiying is the greatest thing of this film. I am over exaggerating but my gosh she is so adorable and has actual chemistry with Jason. In comparison to another summer blockbuster Sophia does so much better than Isabella Sermon. The girl who was in Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom. Cai is 2 years younger!! She did have one film experience before the Meg unlike Isabella who had her acting debut with Fallen Kingdom. Jason does great, arguably his best work in a long time. This movie is just a lot of fun. There are series moments, but they are in good taste and make sense on how they go about. So yes it`s a fun end of summer movie."

      "text": "Scientists at an undersea observation station unleash a gigantic prehistoric shark. Only one man can save the day (and some trapped divers): Jason Statham. Like Dwayne Johnson in last month's Skyscraper, the hero has morphed into a everyman superhero, defying odds that can only be accomplished through movie effects. The plot is by-the-numbers, almost right down to every kill. The attacks are OK, but never spectacular or especially inventive. Still, for someone who enjoys a predictable popcorn escape, this one will keep you entertained. Consider it one step above the Sharknado series."

      "text": "I personally thought this was better than jaws in many regards. I will say its good, I think its worth the ticket price, and its definitely not a shot by shot remake of jaws. The biggest flaw is the obvious cgi in the creature design... But it does its job. If you think someone is going to die off, chances are they are. It follows a lot of standard tropes in the genre... Minor spoiler alert, the black guy doesn't die. If you liked Jaws, there is a good chance you will like this."
