Sadder still is that there are people who believe that longer, stupider, better graphics, or has a celebrity automatically mean better."

You'll sit there bored, uninterested and occasionally cringing at the so-called 'morality,' and that's the worst place to be as a movie\rVERDICT: If a great performance can't save it, you know it's bad. Christmas films can get away with being cheesy, but they can't get away with this."

      "text": "It would be incredibly easy to dismiss this movie outright as inferior to the 1966 animated short, and you would get no arguments from me\u2014it really, truly is, but is still worth at least one viewing due to the supreme effort put by Jim Carrey into the role he was born to play.The story can be summed up in one line from the book: \u201cEvery Who down in Whoville liked Christmas a lot, but the Grinch, who lived just north of Whoville, did not.\u201d Why does he hate Christmas so much? No explanation is given in the original, but here the blame falls upon a childhood incident from which a humiliation was suffered while trying to impress his crush (ah, the power of hormones). In the present, the big green curmudgeon (Carrey) lives atop Mount Crumpit while the Whos celebrate Christmas in increasing extravagance every year, much to his annoyance. Yet one Who, Cindy Lou (Taylor Momsen, who, believe it or not, later went on to form the rock band Pretty Reckless), no longer no more than two but rather about six or seven, recognizes that with the increased focus on the gifts and festivities that people have lost sight of the real point of the holiday, and after learning of the tragic origins of the Grinch decides to seek him out in order to gift him some much-needed Christmas spirit. Through the meddling of the Mayor of Whoville (Jeffrey Tambor), Big G\u2019s old childhood rival, this plan backfires immensely, and after about an hour of the film\u2019s runtime has expired already inspires him to \u201csteal Christmas\u201d. From there, all that\u2019s needed to figure out what happens is a knowledge of the TV cartoon.I must confess, I was a little surprised to learn that this was a Ron Howard-directed project when I first watched this movie, as everything about its atmosphere and imagery reminded me of Tim Burton (nothing like having your Christmas movie narrated by the one and only Hannibal Lecter, am I right?).\u00a0From the live-action adaptation of Dr. Seuss\u2019s Christmas classic, I expected something much jollier-looking overall, and while there is a certain goofiness about the dank, grimy images it\u2019s not something that I feel is exactly appropriate for children in terms of tone until the classic story that they remember starts to kick in. Carrey as well, despite giving a terrific performance through his total commitment to the role, has an intensity about him as a result that is slightly off-putting, especially for the young\u2019uns, and prone to be scary in some bits (his voice, made to sound like a mixture of Sean Connery and Walter Matthau with a touch of menacing growl for some reason, is largely to blame for this). The movie therefore comes dangerously close to being a children\u2019s book adaptation meant for teens or adults, which doesn\u2019t make for a fun situation for anyone. At some point, however, the film manages to rescue itself through alternatingly dedicated and passable performances (the former mainly from Carrey, the latter from most of the supporting cast), an abundance of heart (Old Grinchy probably had some to spare, considering the freakish mutation of his), and comedy that is surprisingly witty for what could have easily been a charmless adaptation of an acclaimed classic. The star that shines the brightest here is, as stated previously, the one and only Jim Carrey, whose role is so perfectly suited to his brand of comedy that you honestly believe that he might have actually been the Grinch in another life. Nearly unrecognizable under what I imagine is pounds and pounds of makeup and prosthetic fur (which won an Academy Award for Best Makeup), Carrey transforms the old grouch from a bitter and miserly recluse into a comic villain resembling a slightly more effective Dr. Evil (who in himself was an Ernst Stavro Blofeld parody), which ultimately makes him more accessible and sympathetic than his previous incarnation in the animated version. An electric screen presence, any scenes that he doesn\u2019t appear in suffer severely from his absence (to borrow a pun from Entertainment Weekly\u2019s Owen Gleiberman, he really does \u201cCarrey the movie\u201d), and the amount of time spent with him never feels like enough upon reaching the end of the movie, even in spite of its primary focus on his character, and this is when you know that something truly special has been created through an actor\u2019s devotion. It\u2019s what makes the first half of the movie fly by (despite having little to do with the original story), and what makes the Grinch\u2019s change of heart ultimately all the sweeter.While not on the same level as the 1966 television special by any stretch, the modern rendition of the Grinch\u2019s tale will be entertaining enough to warrant an occasional viewing. As a warning to those who don\u2019t like Jim Carrey, though, you\u2019ll probably want to steer clear: this film is basically one extended, Christmas-ized version of one of his routines. 7/10"

So, obviously, that's not gonna happen. My advice is to just take the movie for what it is: a light, breezy, and very funny adaptation of one of Dr. Seuss' best works. This has something the animated version didn't have. This one actually explains what made the Grinch such a jerk. Trust me, if I had been picked on as much as he was, I'd have anger issues too. I loved the way this movie dared to explore his attitude from that angle. This film was directed with an enormous amount of energy by Ron Howard. The casting was probably the most brilliant thing about this film. Besides Carrey, the best casting decision was a little girl named Taylor Momsen, who is absolutely wonderful as Cindy Lou, the heroine of the story. I also enjoyed Jeffrey Tambor as the Mayor of Whoville. All I can say is, some critics just need to lighten up and enjoy movies for what they are instead of what they could be."

How The Grinch Stole Christmas is a reasonable childish feature that fulfills and checks off each and every fantasy of a five year old kid but forgets to offer anything more than that in order to satisfy it and hence restraints itself to go bold. Ron Howard is disappointingly not in its A game resulting into some poor execution, amateur editing and loosely placed sequences. As mentioned earlier, its a Jim Carrey's show and he has a lot to offer in here, with amazing skill and perfect comic timing he demands attention from the viewers. How The Grinch Stole Christmas has some one liners, cliched comic sequences and petty writing that miraculously comes alive and helps survive it by stellar performance."
