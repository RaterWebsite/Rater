Great and neat animation, colors, characters, scenarios, etc. I really enjoyed it. Obviously not a very deep plot but still very enjoyable"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "WARNING: There may be spoilers for anyone who hasn\u2019t seen the movie and wishes to discuss it.\u2014Firstly, I love the animation style. This is brought to us by Boulder Media Ltd., an animation house in Dublin, Ireland. The look and feel of the film is top notch. It seems Hasbro has gone all out to give us a really fun, engaging story with all of the proper touches we want in a fantasy film about magical ponies.Sunny Starscout, our earth pony protagonist.Izzy Moonbow, our unicorn friend.Hitch Trailblazer, the Sheriff of Maretime Bay, the earth pony settlement.Pipp Petals, a pegasus princess of Zephyr Heights, the pegasus city, and social media influencer.Zipp Storm, the second princess of Zephyr Heights who would much rather be flying.There are plenty of other characters we get to meet, but these 5 are how we start our journey, and I just feel they meshed so well together. Watching them, I kind of felt they all exhibited some of the traits of the original Mane 6 from MLP: FIM. For example, Sunny has the questioning curiosity of Twilight, along with Applejack\u2019s honesty, Izzy is very much pronkish and random like Pinkie Pie, Hitch has Fluttershy\u2019s ability to soothe animals who fall in love with him, Pipp is Rarity\u2019s fashion and socialite status on fleek, and Zipp definitely possesses Rainbow Dash\u2019s competitive, stubborn nature.I mean, they may not have meant it that way, but I picked up on it. The locations were neat, I like how Maretime Bay was laid back and rural, Zephyr Heights was modern and technologically advanced, and Bridlewood was mystical and quiet. Each one seemed to fit the personalities of its ponies.I like how some of what I expected to happen didn\u2019t happen, I love the self-awareness of some of the ponies, and even the movie itself pokes at some tropes, the music was terrific, with Izzy\u2019s song \u201cFit Right\u201d being my favorite of them all.I think this film is a great start to what I hope is a wonderful series (slated to start October of 2022), and I am so willing to see where they go with this generation.Also, lots of crying moments, anyone else see it and have crying moments? Wistful moments? Just me? Yeah, well done on the part of everyone: the voice actors, the writers, the animators, everyone involved did a bang up job, IMO."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This movie. Was hyped for ages, and...I loved it a lot.Equal parts adorable, funny, and emotional. It's not complex, but it doesn't need to be. Simple movies can be great and enjoyable, just like this one is. As well as **** adorable to watch. The animation is great - so bouncy and bubbly and cute! This feels like a proper 3D evolution of the ponies.The messaging is pretty simple and easy to understand too. The split and anger between the pony races can be described by a single word: racism. Plenty of it to be heard and seen throughout the film, as well as the friendship/acceptance messaging. In my opinion both were showcased and handled well.A lot of the soundtrack is great too! \"Gonna Be My Day\" and \"Fit Right In\" are the best two for me, personally.The emotional factor is great as well. Things constantly go wrong for Sunny, and you just feel bad for her every time. She's so cute and just trying her best to solve the quite harsh racism plaguing the kingdom of Equestria.Stan Izzy. Love Sunny, Zipp and Pipp. Hitch is nice. Sprout is hatable and that's actually probably a good thing since he's...well, the bad guy.I had a great time watching this!

And i gotta be real: even if it has its fair share of problems with the pacing, the third act and some unanswered questions, the actual movie itself was really good.It was a solid way to introduce the audience into this new G5 world, without taking a dump on what made G4 so beloved. The animation is gorgeous, the new characters were likable and relatable, the music was solid, it has some pretty good messages about fighting against racism and accepting new friendship with someone different, it was surprisingly really funny, all the voice actors did a great job, there were a few twists i didn't see coming and it made me even more excited for the upcoming show.Again, for all its flaws, this movie definitely has more than enough great aspects and entertainment value to make up for it and be worth the wait, and i can easily call it the best My Little Pony movie we've seen yet."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "I expected better.

Even knowing that each protagonist pony are descendants of Twilight and her friends, it is something that gives detail to the plot. What I hope is that there is a sequel and they tell us why the separation of the three races and what happened to the scenarios of the series and film. Because well, there were also no dragons, chimeras, griffons, etc. At least give us a series or another movie to explain. Please."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "A poorly made soft reboot, at the end of the day. There's a lot of walking. Doesn't have the same heart and soul of the previous iteration, Friendship is Magic. They try to throw in a left-wing political message, but its more apparent in the marketing campaign than it is the movie.The animation and character designs on the surface appear more detailed, but you'll find both more enjoyable in FiM than you will this. FiM's 2D animation holds up ten years later, while A New Generation doesn't really do anything new or cool with 3D animation.The voice actors in FiM are significantly better than the voice actors here, and seeing as these are \"big celebrity\" voice actors, you'll probably see half of these characters recast for the inevitable TV series. It's hard to not compare this to the Friendship is Magic, G4 iteration of this franchise, when FiM found so much success with demographics outside of the children and families demographic. Maybe that's the lens of the Internet clouding what real success looks like... maybe the adult fanbase wasn't significant enough of a success to warrant following a similar formula, ie fantasy adventure/slice of life set in a fantasy setting. Regardless, the gap in quality between FiM (being high quality for at least most of its run as a TV series, season 8 and 9 dropped off in quality in my opinion) and A New Generation is so significant that its almost hard to even recognize the two as part of the same larger franchise."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Sorry, but it's FlashShimmer's effects.

Had the film been a solo reboot or set during the final episode of season 9 of Friendship Is Magic, I would have been fine with the film and new series.Hasbro killing off all the characters from Generation 4 that were well beloved, including immortal characters and non-pony species is a disrespect to Lauren Faust and those that made that show great. Choosing Vanessa Hudgens to voice Sunny was a terrible idea. She had made porn photos and has done sex scenes and rated R films. This is who Hasbro wants to lead the new My Little Pony? This is not canon to Lauren Faust\u2019s version of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic or IDW\u2019s version of MLP: FIM."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "If it had a few more scenes of character development and anwser some of the questions of what happened and how it happened (I'm sure they're planning to reveal it in the TV Show), I would've like this movie a lot more. But it's not awful, it's cute, it's very funny, the animation is beautiful and the characters are fine. So yeah, it's alright. Not sure if is better or worse than the MLP Movie, but at least is not terrible like Equestria Girls or the original MLP.
