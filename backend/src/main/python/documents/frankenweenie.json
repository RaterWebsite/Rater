      "text": "Frankenweenie is the best animated movie from Tim Burton of all time, because apart from the typical gothic-expressionist environment and characters, we see that science is in between. First we have the signature character of this director, who in this case is a misunderstood boy without friends, although here is expanded to other people of the story, unlike most of Burton pictures. In addition to Victor, there is Elsa (animated Winona Ryder), Mr. Rzykruski (animated Vincent Price), Edgar, Weird Girl, Toshiaki, Bob and Nassor; all these characters are very well physically constructed and have a defined personality. Second, the vision of the science that brings Tim Burton to the plot is awesome, and it is defined by two things that are said by Mr. Rzykruski: people like what science gives them but not the questions that science asks; and, science is not good or bad, but it can be used in both ways. Third, the idea of gothic mixed with science gives the film a fresh air and it is reflected in the moment when the other boys have their experiments. The thing here is that with these series of creatures, we notice the different approaches to science: love of Victor, ignorance of Edgar, over-confidence of Toshiaki, superiority of Nassor, fear of Bob and accident of Weird Girl. Other great things on this movie are the use of Frankenstein elements and the outstanding application of camera, in the picture are noticeable transitions from one images to another, flip over (360 turn) and the famous vertigo effect, formed by simultaneously dolly in and zoom out. Tim Burton could have a perfect film, but the end should be different."

Although the plot is not seamless, this movie is appropriately atmospheric, meticulously detailed, and is filled with strange, quirky characters. A perfect movie for this time of year, \"Frankenweenie\" can be enjoyed by kids and adults alike."

The stop motion animation is first rate.  The story is clever, especially when the animals get morphed together.  I like the decision to make it in black and white.  Good enough for repeated viewings, so I will be purchasing the blu ray when it's released.  This is my favorite Burton film since the underrated \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\"."

It was artistically laid out,  but at the same time the animation and characters had that aesthetically predictable Burton style; yet I was anticipating this (as I'm sure most others seeing this would be), so prepare to be pleased if you enjoy Burton's style.  The moral of the story was great, and there were a lot of funny and heart-felt moments. Overall a great, quirky film!"

      "text": "Tim Burton always surprises me with his vision and unique ideas. Frankenweenie is a very different, emotional and a meaningful film, it has the strong message which is meant to be delivered to viewers of all ages as it discusses the emotional attachment, the utilization of science and the jealousy. The film is about a boy named Victor whose dog 'Sparky' dies in an accident and then he brings Sparky back to life through science. The whole concept and plot of the film pays a direct homage to Frankenstein and it has been incorporated properly, just the right amount was needed and Burton did a great job. Animation is really, really amazing, I have never watched a black and white animation before and this was a new experience for me which proved to be really great. Voice acting is wonderful as always, the accents have been used in a real manner especially Toshiaki's accent, which made me laugh throughout the film. The major reasons why I'm giving it 8 marks are its freshness, originality and Burton's hard work. This is definitely a strong contender for awards season as it has already won so many critics awards and I wouldn't be surprised if it also wins the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature because it totally deserves it."

But Frankenweenie took every classic cliche in the book, and reused them in the most creative ways imaginable. This is just another boy and his dog movie, and more or less follows the traditional formula of this plot to the letter. But it seems to relish in it's own unoriginality, and, ironically, that is what makes it original.\r Overall: While it is everything you can expect, it also throws allot of those ideas at you in creative ways.

And against all odds, they must interfere to the problems they've caused to their community.First of all, the look of this movie in black and white is both eerie and beautiful. Burton really established the perfect tone what this movie needed to bring in its magical way. The strong voice talents are indeed spot on. It knows how to blend the creepy scenes and the comedic scenes to come up with a nice execution and storytelling. On the contrary, some scenes are easily predicted and the main character is underdeveloped in facing his circumstances in the film.VERDICT: In spite of the main protagonist's underdevelopment and predictability of some scenes, Frankenweenie is still a surprising welcome return for Burton."

Directed by Tim Burton, with a screenplay by Leonard Ripps, the film features the voices of Charlie Tahan, Catherine O'Hara, Martin Short and Winona Ryder.It's an animated film in stop-motion, similar to others who Burtom has done. The script makes an interesting reinterpretation of the original Frankenstein. Throughout the film, Burton has honored Ed Wood, one of the worst directors in history of cinema. The story is easy to understand, it's not too adult for teenagers and not too childish for adults. The voice actors did a good and flawless work.However, it's not a particularly memorable film. The story entirely rounds around the dog and its owner in a very predictable manner. It has some moments of humor but we cannot say it's a funny movie. The fact that the cinematography is all black and white will not, of course, please to everyone. The scenarios, depicting the traditional suburban neighborhood of the fifties, are nothing special."

      "text": "Frankenweenie or bringing Tim Burton's mojo back from the deadIn 1984, when Tim Burton worked for Disney made a short film called Frankenweenie, which tells the story of Victor, a boy who after losing his dog Sparky in an accident decides to bring him back to life in the purest Frankenstein style, without considering the consequences this may cause. This work helps us to understand the basics of Burton's thematic and visual style, which became his trademark over the years: dark worlds with isolated and/or solitary characters faced to the reality of the world that confronts or rejects them.It is almost 30 years later and a streak of quite irregular films that Burton returns to his roots and decided to resume the story of Frankenweenie to make an animated feature making use of the stop- motion technique, with which he created some of his best works such as the Nightmare Before Christmas and Corpse Bride, and Frankenweenie is no exception, as it represents a return to the best films of Burton.On this occasion the original story remains intact and makes a bigger emphasis on the impact of the resurrection of Sparky among Victor's friends and as they'll try to emulate the feat with catastrophic results for the small town they live in. Likewise, the relationship between Victor and Elsa, her neighbor and school crush is explored, through which a great reference to The Bride of Frankenstein is made, although it'snot the only one, since along the film there are winks to classic monsters movies from the 30's as the Mummy, Creature from Black Lagoon, Cabinet of Dr. Cagliari and even classic monsters like Godzilla. And the film itself is a homage to this cinema being filmed in black and white and with music in perfect tone by Danny Elfman (Burton's closest collaborator).An innate quality of Burton is the skill to create endearing characters out of the dark and grotesque and the best example of it is Sparky, a little dog now part of the most adorable creations on the burtonian universe, and that somehow reflects many of elements or themes that have remained constant in most of Burton's filmography: childhood, loneliness, friendship and a strange fixation with death and what happens after this.Excepting the end that seems to betray the original concept, it is safe to say that Burton needs to do more films like Frankenweenie and much less like Alice in Wonderland."

At the end of the movie Sparky saves Victor from the burning windmill, but then Sparky gets dragged back in to the crumbling building by the vampire cat. The cat gets stabbed by a wood stack falling from the building and the building crumbles on Sparky. Sparky dies for the second time. Victor is sad a gives the corpse of a the dog a big hug saying that he'll always be in my heart, which was the lesson he didn't learn the first time his dog died. He learned that even though his dog isn't next to him, he'll always be there. That is when the movie should have ended. But they had to bring him back anyways! It makes me so mad this scene. What a great movie brought down by this ending. I give it a 7/10 and that's me being generous."
