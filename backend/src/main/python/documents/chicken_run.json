      "text": "Wow, what a movie. So much references and ideas many people can relate to. Dreaming of freedom. What more can you ask than freedom? The story is about chickens who want to get out of the prison of their own, the Tweedy's Chicken farm. Soon after, a rooster comes to give them hope and establish a dream to leave the torture and fear behind, by flying. The movie is so inspirational and gives a nice message: Don't give up. Besides the serious message, there are some funny lines like when Ginger asked the old rooster: 'You mean you never actually flew the plane?' and he was like 'God heaven's no, I'm a chicken'. He was a chicken as an animal and as a scared little douche bag. Also the funniest one: 'Mi life flashed before mi eyes ....... It was really boring'. There are also some scares that little children wouldn't stomach. But otherwise, it has some harmless jokes and fun. I can't describe how much I love this movie. It's beyond amazing and entertaining."

      "text": "I hadn't seen Chicken Run for a few years and had honestly forgotten how much there is to it - it's far more than a film for kids about rebellious poultry! It's like a weird hybrid of The Great Escape, The Shawshank Redemption and Spartacus, but with animated chickens. It really shouldn't work, but thanks to the genius of co-writers/directors Nick Park and Peter Lord it somehow does. The premise is truly fantastic, after all what animal would dream more of freedom than a farmed chicken? The film has a great cast of interesting characters - Ginger the hyper-intelligent idealist (Julia Sawalha), Bunty the cynical and bad-tempered pragmatist (Imelda Staunton), Babs the constantly knitting, rather dim eternal optimist (Jane Horrocks), Rocky the charming con-artist (Mel Gibson), Mrs Tweedy the wealth-hungry social climber (Miranda Richardson) and the farmer Mr Tweedy, who is convinced he is losing his mind for suspecting that \"those chickens are up to something\" (Tony Haygarth). Though the stop-motion animation quality is such that you can tell what each character is thinking without the need for dialogue, the whole cast give great vocal performances, particularly Sawalha, who gives the story its dramatic weight, Horrocks who is hilarious as always and Richardson who is just plain terrifying. The film has some pretty big themes for an animation about talking chickens - liberty vs. slavery, mechanisation of agriculture, American vs. British politics and the shallowness of modern celebrity culture. Chicken Run is also incredibly funny, with humour ranging from visual gags (an Aardman speciality), puns (\"the lone free ranger\"), pop culture references (Braveheart, Indiana Jones, Star Trek) and quintessentially British comic sensibilities. There's also an exhilarating and visually clever set piece that takes place inside a pie-making machine and a few particularly affecting and surprisingly dark moments such as when the chickens contemplate their own mortality and Babs starts to knit herself a noose. Finally, Chicken Run is an affectionate love-letter to the North of England. Looking at the characters' accents and mannerisms, and especially the beautifully re-created landscapes of the film, you could say that if Wallace and Gromit is Aardman's tribute to the county of Lancashire, then Chicken Run is the studio's tribute to the county of Yorkshire.  We've seen so much brilliant examples of animation from all over the world in the last two decades, but even so, I would suggest Chicken Run is not only the best film Aardman have produced, but that it is also one of the finest examples of British animation the world has ever seen. It's a tragically rare occasion in this day and age that live-action filmmaking is this entertaining, smart, well-balanced and emotionally rewarding. Chicken Run ticks all the boxes, and does so using funny-looking plasticine chickens, a real achievement indeed."

Therefore, the chickens face decided to organize and escape. Ginger is one of the ringleaders, already has many punishments for her rebellion, and the countless failed escape attempts have demoralized the whole hen house. When they all began to settle for their fate, there arises Rocky, an American cock that seems to be able to fly and that breathes new life into the prisoners' dreams of freedom.It's decidedly a remarkable film in every respect. Reminds me of the movie \"The Great Escape\". Personally, I think the creators were inspired a lot in this film to idealize the whole plot. The scenarios are quite detailed and the soundtrack is very good. Technically, stop-motion animation (it's an Aardman Studios movie, and stop-motion is almost a studio tradition) is very good. It's not as good as in newer movies, where other materials were used, but it's positively realistic."

Has a beautiful story.an animation in which we can always be monitored.just so far i didn't get to enjoy it until i was a little bored old years.but the story of chickens never give up for the freedom of escape is a lesson for everyone.

The parallels to Orwell's Animal Farm and real life tragedies like the holocaust are apparent but the story still feels so original and creative. The characters are well developed and fun to watch. There isn't a single weak or unnecessary character. The villains are genuinely hilarious yet intimidating, well written and a true threat to our characters. The scenes Mr. and Mrs. Tweedy are togheter can be its own comedic short film because they are just hilarious. The sets look great. The stop motion animation is genuinely fantastic. The cinematography makes this movie look great and interesting and the score is just amazing."

Apparently Aardman is working on a sequel, and while a part of me is curious why we are getting one almost 20 years later, the other part of me is happy to see this team produce a stop motion film to compete with CG animated films. I highly recommend Chicken Run for the whole family"
