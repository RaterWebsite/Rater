      "text": "I Care a Lot...for Dianne Wiest freedom. There's not a single likable character in this whole movie for me to latch onto. So, at the end I didn't care...hehe. I also found the message of the movie confusing, because it has that empowering feel to it, like a \"girl boss moment!\", even though they are either doing awful things and how none of it was earned, which rubbed me the wrong way. It sends out the wrong message that doing terrible things or destroying other people\u2019s lives (not just the bad guys) is OK, I guess.It also doesn't help this was written by a dude named J Blakeson, a dreadful screenwriter who's previous writing credit was the unnecessary sequel to 'The Descent'. So yeah, this wasn't in good hands at the start.This is honestly the most annoying movie experience I've had in a while. So shallow and empty.Just watch 'Promising Young Woman' instead."

Judge is an idiot (OK, maybe this is accurate) - mob is incompetent - men are badsy people (and stupid and weak, by the way) - and heavily armed guards at old folks homes are all the rage - WTH?????The entire \"girl power\" vibe this movie was giving off really makes you feel sorry for - well - women.  How weak do you hvae to be that somebody had to craft a piece of garbage such as this to \"empower\" them.And the whole lesbian thing has just so been done.

It ultimately turns into a \"which sh*tbag can outsmart the other\" with little thought to why I should even care. I don't mind entertainment with dislikeable characters, like Breaking Bad, when motivations, actions, and sequences are believable. This is not. Pike and Dinklage can both act, but I don't know how they delivered half of their lines without laughing. Suspension of all belief is a must in almost every scene.I can watch many things that suspend reality, but if the core premise of your movie falls apart at scrutiny, most sequences become impotent. It's like a horror movie where they can easily escape the monster, but choose not to leave. Okay, I can get on board with that if there is at least a semi-good reason (Jaws) but this film is only filmed with reasons to not watch it.Oh, and while they may have been trying to empower women, it just kind of makes women (and lesbians) look like terrible people. Kind of like Hollywood's history of typecasting villains with gay undertones (look it up). Personally I think we're in a \"streaming gold rush\" right now and they're all competing for content. We now have exhaustive lists, but the quality has been sharply dropping. This garbage is a perfect example."

The aesthetic is a fancy, pretty people, nice clothe but the characters are not well refined.  Seems like a cheap product of fast consumption, the main topic of guardians abusing elders is like an excuse to the story. The main idea is to show a woman who can go against  organized crime lead by her ambition that makes her cold? I just don't know. Is like a milk carton  with a lost child picture on it."

      "text": "I have turned off two films in my life. The first was \"Irreversible\", a film with the dubious accolade of having the longest rape scene in any film. The other was this. At least with Irreversible, 'that' scene was a) crucial to the plot, and b) not celebrated with high-tempo electronic background music. Unlike \"I Care a Lot\" where our protagonists are seen riffling through their latest victims beautiful home, finding things to sell, like some montage from a Tony Scott film. If the scene's intention was some sort of clever juxtaposition, then it failed. Felt more like lazy/tone-deaf production/direction.There is nothing to celebrate in this film, and why Ros Pike would put her name to it i do not know. It is not clever social commentary, its a celebration of the abuse of the vulnerable. If you're the sort of person that likes to use \"Gammon\" or \"Karen\" as a perjorative, then you'll probably love it. For everyone else, dont waste your time.To Rosamund Pike, you're better than this."

But this film, the amount of \u201ccertified reviews\u201d that praise this film for being \u201cbrave\u201d and \u201cbold\u201d.... just because the lead role is an intelligent, conniving, homosexual female empowering women with a take-home message; there still has to be a real story to tell. I have no problem with said character, in fact I applaud it. However, this film does the opposite. Yes, the premise portrayed does exist and begs questions for its ideas. I love that.
