      "text": "I honestly do not understand the hate the critics had for this film. The primary complaint seems to be that it makes little sense, and its frightening scenes rely on cliches. I don't think either of those complaints are fair. The ship itself literally went to Hell and back, and is even described in the film as having come from \"pure chaos\". It's not supposed to make sense, because sense is a psychological luxury that probably wouldn't exist in Hell. As for cliches, I don't think that's fair either. I'm not a big horror buff, so maybe I just don't see it, but the psychological and physical torment that occurs in the film came off to me as somewhat creative--at the very least, a very well-done cliche. I can totally see why this is considered a cult classic: it's extraordinarily original in its premise, and watching it is, at times, surreal, and very entertaining.Now, if I had one complaint, it would be that it pulls its punches when it comes to horror and gore. Yeah, it's gory, but it's not *that* gory. But I can't knock points off for that because the director himself stated that he was forced by the studio to tone down the gore, which supposedly turned initial audiences off. He's said that he's very sorry he was forced to do that, and he feels it takes away from the effect the film is going for. I'm inclined to agree; for a film essentially about a glimpse into Hell itself, the violence and gore is pretty minor, and I can tell that quite a bit of it was cut or toned down a lot. Still, I liked this film. The characters were entertaining, and the happenings on the ship were creepy, until the final surge of violence at the end as very bad things start to happen. The \"final battle\" with the main bad guy isn't particularly climactic, though, and his design didn't strike me as creative or particularly frightening. Since the horrors on the ship are personal for each person, I would have imagined the good guy's past mistake that cost someone his life as the form of the bad guy, in his post-mutilation form. Well, that's how I would have done it, anyway. Still, it's an entertaining movie, and I wouldn't mind seeing it again."

I thought I'd see what was up with this one since I knew Anderson directed it and actually thought he had a tad bit of potential after I saw this movie, but Alas, it's a resounding no. Well, from what I can remember, Event Horizon was pretty good up until a certain point and then took the proverbial nose dive into total shlockery. It looked great and had a pretty convincing atmosphere of dread. The palette was very sickly and put me off for most of the film. It was a very effectual way of making me feel uncomfortable in a good way. I remember a lot of yellows and greens. So, I was thinking the climax was going to be very satisfying, but it unravelled once they really started to \"explain\" what the mystery was. I will just say it was ludicrous, ruined the movie, and I will leave it at that. I think that was the point where Anderson started his trip into bad director land."

      "text": "Space is just a great setting for horror. The sense of isolation and \"how do I get home?\" mentality add an atmosphere of hopelessness to already bleak circumstances. The futuristic technology that comprises the scenery of these dark, cold ships can be haunting in ways that those creepy mansions just can't. Event Horizon has all of that, but while other sci-fi horror flicks take the standard alien(s) approach, this one goes for a more paranormal angle.\r Does this allow Event Horizon to change the game and bring a new level of horror to outer space? No, not really. When it comes to actual horror, this movie just isn't scary. That's mostly because it can be kind of dumb. However, even the face of it's occasional ineptitudes in writing, it's great premise and liberal amounts of blood and WTF moments make it quite a bit of fun.\r The cast is on point as far as performances go. Granted the characters they're playing aren't much to speak of, but they give it their all with what they were given. It's also a really gorgeous film. Director Paul Anderson's visuals as far as the ship goes are gorgeously futuristic and unnerving. This is one creepy ship. Not all of the CGI has aged well, but the practical effects still look really good. The blood and gore is still pretty nasty to this day.\r So how about that plot? Well, like I said the characters aren't well written individuals. Just faces to suffer through the events. The events themselves are pretty entertaining. While you basically get the core idea of what's going on, there are other elements happening that go unexplained. The whole thing ramps up at such a ridiculous pace that the lack of explanation is only more noticeable. By the time the blood really starts flowing all of the crazy crap happening onscreen starts to seem just so dumb. The movie starts off with this kind of creepy vibe reminiscent of the Alien series and makes you think that things will get scary. However it's not long before you realize that it just won't and will end up relying on blood and creepy spaceship imagery to deliver it's thrills.\r While all of that is a disappointment, the movie is still able to deliver it's thrills. Just not the scary kind. It's an out there and visually stunning ride. One that's stupid crazy enough to keep you watching. Anderson may not be able to deliver the writing or frights necessary to make a truly great horror film, but he's able to make an absurdly fun one. You may be required to check your brain at the door, but if you just want to see some nasty stuff happening in the truly creepy expanse known as outer space, then give Event Horizon a shot. It's one trip through the galaxy that's way more fun than it should be, lack of scares and all.\r 8.9/10"

Plagued by many demons during a troubled production, such as its rushed editing schedule, unfinished CGI and poor sound mix, the film falls apart with gory sequences that feel torn to shreds and stitched back together, not too dissimilar from Sam Neill\u2019s hokey turn after a strong set-up in the first act. Aspects like the techno-gothic aesthetic and spooky atmosphere contribute to a sense of foreboding and dread, but sadly never pay off, thanks in no part to a mediocre Philip Eisner script and ill-advised studio meddling. Despite horrifying visuals and a host of game character actors, in particular the tonally jarring but hilarious Richard T. Jones, Paul W.S.

Set pieces are exciting and well constructed. However, its shortcomings, mainly the script and occasionally the acting hold it back and prevent it from reaching its full potential. The script does not have the same level of intelligence as the scientific principles it explains, meaning that the film is only sporadically clever.

The creators probably did get some of their ideas of a psychological space thriller from ancient corny Soviet 60s films, which are utterly unwatchable for people like me who are used to better cinematography, such as Solaris, but the plot of this film was clearly different.\r This film was easily the scariest Sci Fi film I have seen. The liters of blood being spilt were probably a bit too much, but it had its impact. The way that the story went on without really explaining itself, or what it was exactly that was getting into people's minds and killing them, added to the horror.\r Many critics pointed out that the atmosphere and technology of the Event Horizon was starkly different from the rescue ship, I agree. It was unexplainably different, and looked like something that belonged on a stereotypical alien spaceship as it looked so different. There were many Gothic-esque spikes located all around the FTL engine, and the access tunnels in the engine room were all bizarrely colored, with green and blue glows.\r Some critics complained about the fact that Dr. Weir had to explain to the crew how his faster than light engine worked, because they should have known more about elementary physics, seeing as they work in space. I disagree, most of the main characters were more of the very expendable \"Space Soldier\" mold of space explorers from Stargate,  Alien II, or Starship Troopers, and had plenty of applied engineering, medical, or combat expertise, but they were not the contemporary highly educated and decorated astronauts of our time. This movie, like Alien II (in comparison to Alien (I)), is set in a time when space exploration is commonplace, so the people doing the exploring are not necessarily highly intelligent or educated, and have to be easily replaceable by other trained, but not very educated, personnel due to the fact that space accidents are happening all the time.\r The common complaint I understand the least is the one that says something along the lines of \"We never even found out exactly what happened to the crew of the Event Horizon 7 years earlier!\". Did you not watch the part of the movie where they fixed the log, and played the recording of the crew dying? They clearly did not survive, and died in unimaginable circumstances. When they found the ship 7 years later, it was extremely cold, and life support was not on. Do people really mean \"We never found out what happened to all but one of the bodies if the original crew...\"? That is never explicitly explained (you could speculate that they got vented into space, or sucked into the liquid around the FTL engine). The movie clearly, and graphically shows exactly what happened to the original crew, and some lines towards the end of the movie also confirm this."

I was never scared, never intrigued, never sad/happy for the characters, never nothing. The direction is uninspired af which makes the movie soooo boring. It's a shame because the story was kinda interesting but the telling was horrible. For exemple, they don't stop describing hell as the most disturbing/torturous place but we never see any of it except badly lit props and Sam Neill with too much make up. Looks more like schizophrenia than hell to me.This movie is a such a mess."

      "text": "The biggest problem with this movie is that it is all build up with no bang. Imagine staring at a bomb. You watch the bomb's timer count down from 10 and as the counter reaches 0, nothing happens. The bomb doesn't detonate and you go about your day. If you pardon this weak analogy, it is actually a perfect comparison to this film. Every time something tense happens there is no payoff. Its all build up to nothing. For example while avoiding spoilers, a character will be in a room of the ship and they get the feeling of being watched. They snoop around for five minutes and nothing happens. Its extremely annoying and makes the entire film lack any sense of dread as you know no matter what you think will happen, nothing will. On top of that characters all act stupid, as they ignore things imperative to their survival that have had explained to them. One of the characters is so stupid that I was actually glad that they died. Only a few deaths seem to feel authentic to something that would actually happen in the given situation. Most of them however seem fabricated by \"horror movie syndrome\" with people acting stupid just so we can watch them die. So along with stupid characters, and weak horror aspects my biggest gripe with this film is of how much wasted potential it had. At the beginning the movie was giving Dead Space vibes. This is nothing short of a good thing as DS is one of my favorite video games series ever. But as it progressed what seemed like a movie that was going to be DS or Aliens-like slowly turned into a House on Haunted Hill (the 1999 version), IN SPAAAAACCCCEEE! I do not recommend this film. Although the atmosphere is amazing and the acting is actually pretty good, halfway through the film it just turned into a different movie. A stupid one."

      "text": "I can't tell you how this ends because I could not stand to watch it any more.  I knew from the beginning that it was doomed when they relied on attempts at startling the viewer(s?) with sudden over the top volume music in scenes that did not deserve it.  Why would you resort to this in the early stages of a movie when it is not warranted?  Probably because this movie does not warrant being watched unless you just like to watching Si-Fi Goth sets.  I give it a 1 because it is just a bad movie but I have to leave room for the really terrible ones.  If the studio really wanted to piss away 50M$ I have suggestions and none include making crap like this."
