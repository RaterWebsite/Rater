It's a total dudebro movie at times and a little cheesy as a result. The plot is absurd and the stunts are ridiculous. That doesn't make them any less fun to watch though. The thing that holds it all together is it's star. Only Vin Diesel is probably the only person with the charisma to pull this one off. Even when his one-liners are dorky the dude is just still all too cool. He saves the movie from descending into cringe-worthy stupidity and delivers a very enjoyable action movie with exciting, over-the-top stunts. It's even a nice little breath of fresh air in the now all too stale genre of spy movies."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I thought it was a pretty good action movie.

I didn't feel any bond forming with any character, just a hollow acting and cliches even for 2002. Even being slightly tipsy couldn't make me enjoy this movie and I am not hard to amuse. All scenes and their purpose were enigma to me till the very end. Stereotypical \"badass\" main hero and a woman he meets later that fall in love with each other throughout the movie. Even more stereotypical bad guy. In conclusion I do not recommend watching this, unless you have the lowest of standards and time to waste."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "You tend to know what you are getting when you watch a Vin Diesel movie. With XXX I feel like it was a bit far fetched. The plot and the dialogue was a little out there, even for Vin. I mean, okay, this guy is a stunt man who can do pretty crazy things and not die. How does that qualify him to potentially be an undercover operative for the government? This movie seemed like someone trying to bench too much, slinking one side back and forth, not ever really reaching a full rep. There were a few stunts, pretty women, music, and humor to kind of smooth things over some but ultimately, Its on the lower end of Vin's talent. If you are a action junky, watch it and decide. I have a soft spot for the Des, so I gave it a try, but there's not much I can defend for this one."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "A threat to the Bond franchise? Not a threat so much as a salute.

I don't know how anyone could stand watching this putrid movie. Some of the worst acting I've ever seen, terrible plot, and offensively bad dialogue. Somebody would say that the movie isn't meant to be taken seriously. Neither are James Bond or Die Hard movies and I liked them a hell of a better than this garbage. Avoid this movie like the plague. The ending was an embarrassment to any action movie. Vin Diesel needs to make another Riddick game and drop his acting career. The Boiler Room was the best acting he's ever had and he didn't even play a significant role in that movie. He is convincing as the Riddick character, too bad the only thing the last Riddick movie had going for it was the fantastic Sci-Fi environment.
