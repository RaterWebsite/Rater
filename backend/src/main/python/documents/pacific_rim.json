      "text": "Disclaimer: I loved this movie. I watched it twice, back-to-back, in 3D.\r I loved the action and the spectacle. The battles, despite the one absurdity of giant robots fighting alien invaders had sense of realism that was rather unnerving. Everything but that (minor detail) was eerily plausible. I also liked the other messages found throughout. Mostly, though, I loved how it all came together as a kind of celebration of the value science and technology when coupled with human courage, ingenuity, innovation, self-sacrifice, individualism (when appropriate), and cooperation (when appropriate).\r It's the many minor messages within the movie that made it stand out from mindless summer action movie fare (which are fine, on occasion).\r First, what I like the most: I liked abiding theme of science and technology being tools for human salvation. There are literally no scenes without some object of human ingenuity in view. The giant robots are man-machine saviours that aid humanity in fighting against grotesque organic monsters.\r (As an aside: I like nature. I was raised in a rural area, and I enjoyed camping. But make no mistake, nature can be brutal, and it is only human scientific, technological, social, and other developments that can keep the monster at bay. If you doubt me, try surviving alone and without man-made equipment for a week in virtually any natural environment. You may not be dead, but you'll almost wish you were. Where I live (just outside a city of 1 million), you\u2019d be dead in less than 5 hours without winter clothing, six months a year. Nature can be subservient to us, but it must never again be our master. Precambrian humans had an average life expectancy of 31 years. Also, like the monsters in this movie, any number larger wild animals would kill a human without a second thought. A bear will rip a child to shreds. Wolves (prior to their gradual domestication by killing the more violent ones over the centuries), were a particularly large threat in Europe. An elephant will gore a grown man. And so on. **It is solely our scientific, technological, and social advancements made possible by an appropriate mix of individual initiative and group cooperation that keep the nightmare at bay.** The movie Pacific Rim acknowledges this. Unlike the technological luddism of, for example, the Terminator movies or Avatar [which both partially denigrate technology and science], this movie celebrates human achievement and progress. And movies could use more of that.)\r I liked that movie (unlike almost all American blockbusters) takes place in several locations, none of which are large American cities. The United States comprises about 5% of the global population, and it\u2019s nice to see that represented in an American blockbuster. And how many times do you really want to see New York destroyed, for instance?\r I appreciated the message that both cooperation and individual initiative are prudent and necessary. The fight against (for instance, there are several instances of insubordination and deviations from military procedure, but they mostly involve serving the greater good).\r I liked the love story component. The lead man was not a handsome male Brad Pitt lookalike, and the female love interest was not the typical American supermodel of action flicks. Rather, she was an English-speaking Chinese national who models the very best traits of many females from that culture. She is polite and respectful, yet stands up for her beliefs non-confrontationally, and she is obviously intelligent. She is \"equal but different\" from the main male protagonist.\r I appreciated the cursory mention of the cause for the alien invasion: global environmental degradation, the (spoiler) reason for the alien invasion.\r Although there is much \"apocalyptic porn\" (hey, I like it too), the body count is actually quite low. While we see entire skyscrapers destroyed, because civilians are evacuated in shelters, the number of civilian casualties is less than 100. (Contrast that with \"Man of Steel\", which had a casualty count of six or seven figures).\r It was nice to see scientists portrayed are heroes. The two scientist characters literally risk their lives to test a theory and gain evidence that is crucial to a positive outcome. This world needs more scientists and technologists. Even the characters' stereotypical eccentricity is endearing: they have their foibles, but they are each aware of it. Sometimes, human foibles are unavoidable, and condemning people for (relatively) harmless quirks that they cannot change serves no purpose.\r I did like that movie avoids many Hollywood clich\u00e9s (for the above reasons).\r If I had one complaint, it's that the movie is too short. It's 2 hours and 10 minutes. However, there is less action than I would have liked. It's not that there is too much \"non-action\" content. It's just that another 30 minutes or so of giant robot battles would have been swell.\r In short: see it."

      "text": "\"Pacific Rim\" is a spectacle for the eyes and ears. I mean this movie is a visual treat from well detailed robot and monster designs to high over the top, but well choreographed action sequences and massive collateral damage. The world that Guillermo del Toro creates is imaginative and his character designs are mesmerizing and complex. The sound design and the sheer force of the films score captivates you into a ride of sight and sound that pleases all your senses. From the metal grinding noise of the robots to the fleshy and almost beast like cry the monsters make, this film has you feeling like you are right there in the middle of the action.\r While the movie is mostly is a visual treat, it doesn\u2019t forget about its characters and there humanity. The film isn\u2019t all bells and whistles, it really does have some really nice character moments in its script, which are about overcoming fear, moving on and trust. These moments make us care for the events that are unfolding. However, the script isn\u2019t all serious business, it knows when to have fun. Some of these moments can be a bit too campy though and some of the emotional moments feel forced. The film sometimes even becomes contrived, mainly towards the end. However, director Guillermo del Toro balances things pretty well.\r The actors in this film do a pretty good job, but the only real standout is Idris Elba as Stacker Pentecost.This character is sort of the leader of the resistance and Elba commands attention every second on screen. Charlie Hunnam is pretty good as Raleigh Becket, a Jaeger pilot, who left the resistance after a traumatic incident. I wish they showed more of his inner battle, it would have invested us into the story more. Rinko Kikuchi as Mako Mori is really hit or miss. The scenes where she is more reserved are good, but when she tries to emote, it can be awkward at times. The rest of the cast is pretty solid and the supporting cast is pretty good, especially Charlie Day, who brings some of the lighter moments to the film.\r Overall \u201cPacific Rim\" as a giant robot versus giant monster movie is pretty awesome. The visuals, sound, and well directed action are all top-notch. They provide a treat for the eyes like never before. Even the 3D is spectacular, the best I\u2019ve seen since \u201cAvatar,\" it really absorbs you into del Toro\u2019s imaginative world. The story, mainly the human element, is a bit weaker as it can feel contrived at times. It keeps us involved, but never takes us to the next level of emotional satisfaction. I give it 4/5, a blockbuster with some of the coolest and most imaginative action that I have seen this year."

Exceptionally well crafted, with full saturation of neon colors, rain and goo. Director Del Toro probably takes the uber geek fan film into a territory the general audience might not want to go. The battle scenes deliver, and the performances from the actors deliver maximum dedication to the material. My bet is that the film will find a devoted audience, and especially inspire young kids. This is far closer to the Godzilla 1998 film should have been. The executive who greenlit this film was fired, so be grateful that this blank check geek epic got made."

      "text": "The script was awful, the CGI was good, the story was stupid, and the physics of everything... just impossible.\r- Seriously, building enormous robots, out of heavy metal, only to have them fist-fight with sea monsters? Punching and throwing monsters on buildings? I have no words to describe how stupid that really feels. Why do they have plasma guns if they only use it AFTER being ass kicked  Is the plasma too expensive for them? Are they running on car batteries and they don't want to waste the power?\rAt the end, one of the robots seem to have discovered a swordlike weapon. Wow, that could have been useful earlier.\r- Another gem was the UN chairman saying they wont fund the robots anymore... like they have a choice... I cannot see the other choice though... Do not tell me the other choice was building walls. It's ridiculous.\r- Judging by the size of the robots and monsters fighting... in the sea... every time they fell, a giant wave should have started and clean the land. Instead, nothing like that happens.\r- The worst scene ever was when the ginormous robot picks up 2 buses and use them to splatter the head of a monster... Like just using it's ginormous metal hands wouldn't be enough. The buses must be built of stronger steel than the robot itself?\r - It was \"awesome\" the fact that the scientists had to physically go to the army base in order to tell them that it's not gonna work (the plan). This is happening in 2017 or 2027? Awesome... so they uninvented the phones cellphones...\r- It picks up buses in it's hand, then later it picks up a huge navy boat. Judging by their proportions, that ship was no taller than a bus, only longer. Really?\r- In the ending fight scene... underwater... those monsters roar like they are on the surface. Awesome again.\r- The idea to send an atomic bomb inside the rift came to them after 10-15 years from the beginning of the attacks, after tens of millions of civilian deaths... sounds reeeeaallly realistic :)\r- On the base, the oxygen levels from inside the robot, are still readable from inside the rift (inter-dimensional portal)\r- When the rift (bridge) collapses, it's representation in the army base shows it as it happens... in realtime... with nice effects... wow... the programmers of the future thought of everything, also installed sensors from top to bottom of the rift without even going there?\r- The fighting scenes are so dark and shot from such angles so that I could not understand what was happening most of the time.\r- And seriously... 6 helicopters move around the robots? Those giant metal machines? That is impossible, to say the least.\r- The black market guy, just stands and chats while at two feet from a giant monster that 10 seconds ago was demolishing buildings and boats, and only seemed to die from no reason at all? That is realistic in what universe?\r- Why would the head of the robot need to be detachable from the body? Why did the pilots have to enter the head... somewhere 10 feet above the 20 meters high robot, and after they entered the head... it would start descending into it's place... These stupid moments could have been used to develop some characters background stories\r- No story for the characters. Besides the surviving brother and the surviving Japanese girl no other character has any story? Let's say I liked the fighting scenes... More like the idea of the fights. But they were too long, and too silly. Fighting with their fists against sea monsters... that is just peachy.\r I expected so much more from this movie... now I have no idea why"

      "text": "NOTE: All my reviews right now are being published as 0/10 for some reason. I actually gave this movie a three, so ignore the current rating. I went into this movie expecting nothing but big dumb fun. What I got was big and dumb, but sadly lacking in \"fun\". Too much of the film is centred on one-dimensional human characters just talking while we impatiently wait for the action to start again. I know we should care about the characters and everything, but even with all this time spent with them, I couldn't care less about whether they lived or died. The main character is so bland that I can't even remember his name (or really anything he does) and his love interest is just as bland (though at least they tried to give her a backstory). Idris Elba's character was the only one who had any personality. Even the Robot-Monster fights occupy about 15 minutes of the running time and are mostly done in darkness. This is disapointing, since Guillermo Del Toro is such a great director, and this film should have been so much better. Instead, it begs unfortunate comparisons to Michael Bay's \"Transformers\" series. If you're fine with there being more uncompelling human \"drama\" (if it can even be called that) than the action they promised us, then good for you. Otherwise, I can't recommend this. 3/10."

Guillermo Del Toro take relativity unknown actors, mixed in with some more better known ones and makes this massive, visually enticing film that only leaves you wishing and/or wanting more. Will the sequel come? That'll be something for Warner Bros. to decide, but if they want another hit, green light the sequel and let Del Toro do his thing. This movie more than makes up for the disaster horror movie he released earlier in the year, in \"Mama\". Nobody was expecting this to be what it has become, so its easily a major surprise. I wouldn't go so far as to say, \"best movie of the year\" (that, personally for me, still lies with \"The Place Beyond The Pines\").

Every twist and device in the movie is a complete rip-off of something else, but it's so damned FUN that you can't help to like it...unless you are allergic to good times.  As someone who enjoyed a little (ok...a lot of) Voltron back in the day, the \"sword\" scene almost had me jumping out of my seat.  If you like robots and giant monsters, you love this movie.  If not, I am sure there is some Scandinavian neo-realist retrospective playing somewhere."

Of course, like all these type of godzilla-esque films comes the Japanese themes. The Japanese have always enjoyed designing these types of films. Be it Godzilla, Godzilla vs Mothra, Godzilla vs Gomora, Godzilla vs Baragon and so on, but they lack resources to produce proper visually attractive films. The makers of this film took the idea of robots fighting godzilla monsters and turned it into this beautiful film.\r I have no other words to describe this. Just go and watch it."

      "text": "Gonna start off with the negatives  Painfully generic and predictable story that you can call from a mile away. The acting is so-so and it does suffer from a few poor casting choices (Charlie Day anyone?).\r That being said, The battle scenes are freaking fantastic. So incredibly well done, They are simply addicting to watch. That alone makes the film worth watching and I really wish that I had seen it in theaters in 3-D because it would have been a blast.\r So overall, Thankfully the story is not a major focus but the battles are. For that alone, It's worth checking out because it can be rather enjoyable to watch."

But when i saw it, i was pleasantly surprised. it was actually a pretty good film, it had a good story line, amazing visuals, and good action scenes. i really only had one complaint though, there is very little character development. Ok, maybe I've been spoiled by evangelion, but there really isn't much. i mean, with some of the characters you meet them, you see their robot, their dead. you never really get to learn much about them, but besides that this was a very good film i believe is worth watching."

      "text": "\"Do you want to sit here or go out there and do something really stupid\" Pacific Rim is a gigantic monster brawl.  But not like Godzilla versus Mechagodzilla.  It has awesome special effects, great acting and a amazing story.  Something that you would usually get in a movie like Argo or Lincoln.  But this movie delivers all that.  Don't be turned off by the genre and even though it's in third place in the box office it is easily better than Grown ups 2 in critical reception and it may be better than Despicable Me 2 for older kids.  So really it should be number 1.  Also if you think it may be scary for little kids that's not true.  There only gore that comes from the monster and one or two curses.  Maybe not for 4-8 years olds but anyone older will probably be alright. So anyway this films boasts amazing visuals, great acting and a great story.  I wouldn't be surprised if it won an Oscar for best visuals.  This is a definite must see."

Then the movie started, this overly dramatic and long, nagging story-telling that is typical for American Hollywood movies was something that I certainly didn't expect from Guillermo del Toro. Even the jokes in-battle were abundant and broke the tension that actually made me want to see more of this film. The acting is stiffer than Expandables and in the end I thought Guillermo was pulling a leg at everyone, pointing out how cliche and staged action movies are these days. When I walked out the cinema I wondered whether I watched WWE or just the South Park episode..."

It has a relatively straight forward story, but it doesn't need to be complicated. It was well acted, had substance, and I was thoroughly entertained throughout. This is what awful robot movies like Transformers or Robot Jox should have been like, and it was better than monster movies like Cloverfield."

But really, there\u00b4s nothing else apart from the stunning visual effects. People say this is the way Transformers should have been done. And I know the director is great. Whatever. I\u00b4ve not seen those ones. I need a story and character development for crying out loud! I was really bored, I almost fell asleep (of course I was watching it at night but I always do) and it never happens to me. A 5 out of 10 for the visuals. If not it would obviously be a 0.

Del Toro makes this colosual Mechas come alive in a way that I've never seen before. Of course it has many cliches but it's a Robot vs Monster movie, what did you expect? The character do feel generic but IMHO they fit in a perfect way. If this movie would had been released in the 90s it would have marked my childhood.\r If you are a fan of Mecha anime or shows this is a must see."

      "text": "I appreciated the fact that \"Pacific Rim\" wasn't overly hyped like a lot of films usually are.  I guess that's probably Guillermo del Toro's MO when it comes to films.\r That being said, I loved it.  The fights were epic, with each Kaiju requiring a different tactic to defeat and the introductory timeline showing the dwindling numbers of Jaegers still active set a tone of desperation for humanity.  That leads back to the film's battle sequences, where you don't know if a Jaeger (and its pilots) will survive the fight or not.  Sudden twists with the Kaiju elicited a \"what??\" response from me on more than one occasion.  An engaging story together with intense battles made the movie one of the best films I've seen this summer."
