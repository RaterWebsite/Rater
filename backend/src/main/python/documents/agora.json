The fall of the Roman empire in the hands of the Christians fundamentalists was depicted with a terrific simplicity, yet with great efficiency. Alexandria, the heart of all knowledge in Antiquity, scorched like a wounded giant... One thing is true about this two hours long story, Rachel Weisz reached a high level of talent in the wondrous incarnation of Hypatia."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "This movie, while visually quite good and having a strong message, is essentially a parable for adolescents. It lacks complexity and is reminiscent of other movies like \"V for Vendetta\" and \"American History X\". If you are a serious cinephile this movie will disappoint."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Hmm. This is a tough movie to critique. I love historical dramas... especially well made ones. This one falls in the middle in all respects. The acting is passable, the plot is passable and the production values are passable. The problems include that the history behind the personages and events is questionable, the script is a little corny, and the pacing is sometimes slow. The positives: The sets are impressive, the lead character who plays the woman philosopher turns in a strong performance, and  you do feel sympathy for some of the characters, despite the corniness. All in all: this is a cautionary tale about religious fanaticism and for that reason alone is worth watching!"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Agora is an utterly compulsive piece of historic drama. The set and effects are unbelievably fantastic, the acting is spot on and the plot is guaranteed to delight those with a passion for history or science. This is a great film that will make you want to throw up your arms and immediately turn to nihilism."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "A very good film that shows the greatness of Ipazia. I personally don't agree with the negative critics I read here, because I really like this movie. The only negative thing, in my opinion, is the presence of too much violent scenes."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "The visuals and characters are carefully crafted to make sure everything is authentic to the time period. The story is based on true history with some freedom taken with the unknowns about Hypatia, but the unknowns seem to be filled with the most realistic things that she would have been doing. The movie also contains the greatest hit and the greatest rejection in movie history. However the soundtrack is mediocre and the ending was changed a bit to make it more dramatic and less brutal."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "A thoughtful well made movie reproducing 4th century Alexandria."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Compelling, relevant, and devastating melding of drama, science, history and religion.

I find this is a perfect movie given the state our world is in right now. Science versus ideology."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "This film is very interesting for several reasons, but the main is, in my opinion, going over a troubled period, decisive for the construction of the modern world: in this historical period, the classical culture (Greco-Roman matrix, but absorbing cultural and religious characteristics of other peoples, like the Egyptians) will face a morally motivated Christian community, decided to lie paganism on the ground. This film deals with the collateral damage suffered by scientific knowledge, thanks to Christian fanaticism and association of classical scholars with paganism.While there were several clashes between Christians (mostly because of heresies, which are never spoken in this film), they usually had a more defensive attitude with the heathen, that history remembers as persecutors. This attitude has changed in the end of the Roman Empire, when Christians achieved to be socially important. That's what the film portrays when Christians (particularly Parabolani, volunteers caring for sick and dead without being monks, that later became the bishop's \"guards\") persecute and kill the heathens. They, in turn, choose to convert, bulk and quickly, to Christianity, which give us the idea that the city, in a few days, went from a pagan majority to a Christian majority. History belies the film: it is a fact that the conversion of the pagans took more than a century. When conflicts portrayed in the film occurred, probably most of the city was already Christian. Conflicts also arise against Jews, being urged by bishop St. Cyril of Alexandria (proof that a saint does not have to be an angel). The conflicts between him and other Christian patriarchs (Antioch, Jerusalem, Byzantium, Rome) are never spoken in the film. Thus, we can conclude that the script, by Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar (who is also the director) and Mateo Gil, is a pale and highly partial reflection of all these conflicts.The cast, headed by Rachel Weisz and Max Minghella, does a reasonable job. Weisz plays the lead role, Hypatia of Alexandria, a mathematical and astronomer who really existed and is considered one of the brightest minds in the late classical period. Its a very good actress who has made some notable films and shows again her versatility. Minghella also made a good performance as Davus, a platonic lover of Hypatia. Finally, one word to the costumes and scenery: the costumes seem to fit the period and place, with its classical influences; however, I don't believe that Alexandria (in particular its library) were so similar to a pre-classical Egyptian temple, especially if we consider that the city was founded by Alexander the Great and the archaeological excavations reveal a deeply classical city, much like Greek or Italian cities.This film is a fairly regular film: despite neglecting the historical truth in various ways and at various times, and despite the highly partial and negative portrait of Christians, the film shows an interesting time, where a lot has changed very quickly, as well entertains the audience and tells a good story."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "An interesting movie about faith and fundamentalism. i liked it because i agree with it. that is probably one's biggest reason to like the film. i also liked the characters and the science."}], "recommendations": ["gone_with_the_wind", "risen", "snowden", "tolkien", "free_state_of_jones", "the_lovers", "samson", "men_of_honor", "the_imitation_game", "the_last_duel", "the_last_samurai", "the_pianist", "the_reader", "the_last_king_of_scotland", "hostiles", "seven_years_in_tibet", "the_white_tiger", "gattaca", "dogville", "darkest_hour", "colette", "upside_down", "spotlight", "blood_diamond", "the_33"]}
