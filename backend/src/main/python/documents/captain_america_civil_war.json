This movie really delivered for me. There were intense, serious, darker moments mixed in with hilarious moments. Not to mention the action was top notch. The fight choreography was amazing, on par with the winter soldier, and the airport battle has to be one of the best action scenes of all times. It was honestly incredible. Spider-man and Black Panther were awesome additions to the MCU and I'm excited for their solo movies. Be sure to stay for the two end credit scenes. I cannot wait to see what the Russo Brothers do with Avengers Infinity War!"

The Action was solid but i ve got the feeling half the film consisted just of action and that was sometimes very tiring. And i cant understand why they made him so young when the comic spiderman is much older and has family. Because this spiderman would be good in a standalone movie but in civil war he is just misplaced. As someone who has read the comics i give him 3/10 wouldnt i habe read them it would be 5/10 but not more."

To be fair, its better than BvS but that's the only positive thing I can say about this. Spider-Man is just flat out irritating and the way he is shoehorned into the story is horrible. Black Panther is just - nothing. Every 'joke' fell flat with the half empty audience I watched it with, and I've never seen so many punters take a loo break, and no one seemed to be saying nice things on the way out so don't think I'm alone in my thinking. Kids will be bored to tears until the airport scene. Admittedly, that scene will entertain the young, but they'll probably be asleep or on their smartphones by the time it arrives."

He does not have the breath of cinema. He does not have the eye of the cinema. It has not the time of cinema. And 'a film thought in 4: 3, with a depth of field and width of production from Netflix look.\rNot that this is necessarily a bad thing (especially when an episode of a serial has never been so beautiful) but we are at the movies **** not in front of the TV. Pretty much the only good thing left of Age of Ultron was thrown away (where Whedon, despite his past as filmed cable, a bit of cinema has tried to do so).\rThe two storyline of the film, although intertwined very well unlike film as BvS, have succeeded in half: the Zemo plan is uncertain to say the least, the bad fact won the uselessness of the film award and all the events related to Bucky, in my opinion, too much attention away from the concept of \"civil war\" and, in the first part, I have also quite bored (and I was not the only room). The storyline on the Civil War, although very interesting and presented in an almost excellent, with all the motivation consistent for each character to be part of one side or another, is developed very little and absolutely so flat and not very brave. Do not you feel the climate of \"civil war\" (I do not speak of rissoni cartoon, but the background that reigns around crossover that gave a unique feel to the reader, plunging him also it into a civil war, where the enemy are not outsiders but people who until recently were brothers), the protagonists often get lost in idle chatter and exchange flips. It lacks the drama, lacking the excitement and miss the involvement of the viewer (that's why I say that is cool)\rThen in truth there is the opening scene and especially those 40 minutes mentioned above that are a different story. All defects already explained that in my opinion are present in this film magically disappear, and the film becomes what it should be: an exciting, technically perfect and thrilling clash-encounter between supertizi. in short, a masterpiece (if you notice, also and above all from the point of view of directing the film changes a lot bringing us abruptly to the movies).\rAfter the airport scene, the situation is as before but with very muted aforementioned defects (the direction changes again!).\rThe conclusion I consider it a less courageous film TWS and therefore do not live up to its predecessor."

      "text": "A great continuation of the Captain America saga, though it's more like \"Avengers 2.5\" than a standalone Cap film. Despite that, Evans gives probably his best Cap portrayal yet: less brooding, but more assured. He's clearly comfortable in the role now, and is never outshone by Downey jr.'s Stark / Ironman. The usual great Marvel action sequences are back, with a story that takes a while to build but has a great twist at the end. At the film's center lies the question: should the Avengers be put under UN oversight, or not? Both sides are presented well, and the main threat is approached by each side in different (and conflicting) ways,  generating much of the tension for the final showdown. 8/10 for yet another great ensemble film from Marvel.Drawback: you need to have seen The Winter Soldier and Age of Ultron for all the characters' motivations to make complete sense."

      "text": "Captain America: Civil War is essentially the current culmination of what has transpired in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) since 2008 with the release of Iron Man 1, pitting two heroes, Captain America and Iron Man, against one another in a battle of personal beliefs and morals. However, these are not the only players involved in this superhero extravaganza, with Captain America being joined by the Winter Soldier, Falcon, Scarlet Witch, Ant-Man and Hawkeye, and Iron Man teaming up with War Machine, Black Widow, Vision, and newly introduced, Black Panther and Spiderman. Civil War is definitely the most intense and mature of all the MCU films and what the Russo's (directors) really grasped well is creating an environment where we as the audience can invest and care for these heroes on an emotional level, which is testament to what the MCU has done with all these well-developed characters. Throughout all these years, we have seen all these characters evolve, not just as heroes but as people. The histories of both Steve Rogers and Tony Stark are central to the story that develops in Civil War, and the events that ensue creates the division within the Avengers, as well as the people watching the film unfold. This also helps our villain, Zemo, increase his influence on the audience, because as invested viewers, whether you picked a side or not, no-one wants the villain to achieve his goal. With great writing, great directing and great acting, this film acts on what it intends to achieve superbly, creating the best Marvel film seen to date."

      "text": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!!! PLEASE READ THIS DISCLAIMER BEFORE STARTING REVIEW!!!\r*\r*\r*\r*\r*\r*\r*\r*\r*\r*\rGreat. Now that you're past the buffer, let's talk about this movie. Captain America: Civil War is the ultimate movie in a trilogy of Cap movies in Marvel's Cinematic Universe. Many people are labeling it Avengers 2.5, but I see it as the future of Marvel movies to come.\r Before I rave about this movie, let's talk about some downsides. There were a few moments where I was thrown out of the action (and I don't mean the Jason Bourne-type action you may be thinking about, I mean the plot, the general action of the movie). One was near the end of the airport scene (which will be discussed) where Scott Lang is taken down and gives a crummy quip. This is pretty nitpicky though. Second was the moment where Cap and Sharon Carter share a kiss. Cap says it was a long time coming, but this moment had little setup. Their relationship started in the last movie with them being neighbors and did not range farther than that. In this movie, Sharon is an ally to Cap. I believe that had they strengthened the relationship in the previous movie or simply laid more groundwork in this one for a connection, the moment might have been more believable. NITPICKING! Lastly, the camera movements regarding the action sequences at the mission in Lagos is dizzying, and not in the good, filmmaker way. I've seen Cap 3 twice and both times I got nauseous just trying to follow Black Widow with my eyes. But again, nitpicking.\r Now I've heard the argument from some people that it is unfair to have such connected movies in this Cinematic Universe because the emotional and storytelling heavy lifting has already been done in previous movies that have come out years before. I think that argument is utter bulls**t. It is. Let's get a reality check: people go and see these movies. Not just some, not just comic book fans, but a LOT. OF. PEOPLE. This movie as of now worldwide is on the verge of a billion dollars and is only on its third week of release. Both Avengers movies grossed over a billion dollars and the previous Captain America movies have made bank, not to mention every other MCU film. No film in the franchise has been a flop, not one. And in this culture we live in today, infused with fame and pop culture, there are enough people out there willing to help those who can't see the movies prior.\r Think of it like this. You're reading Harry Potter. All the books in the Harry Potter series are part of a shared universe, you gotta read them in order to understand the emotional weight of the story, not to mention the bare bones logic. You wouldn't read Order of the Phoenix without reading Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire. You would be lost, seeing two years go by of story.\r And so it is with the MCU. While Marvel has done a stellar job with making great movies that standalone, the cohesion of the universe only ever adds to the power of the story and Captain America: Civil War is a testament to that. First spoiler of the day: The \"twist\" at the end of the movie that gets us our final fight in Siberia was actually shown to us very subtly in Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Had you not seen that movie, then you still weren't left out to dry because Civil War had enough setup to understand Tony's relationship to his parents and Bucky's involvement in the Winter Soldier brainwashing program. Having watched the previous movies only adds to involvement of the audience.\r Let me say this of the MCU before I move on. I heard some people I knew who watched the movie say that it was very confusing (they hadn't watched anything but Avengers movies) and what they were confused by was where characters were at in their story. I say that this is not an issue of the filmmakers but rather the audience. When you walked into the theater to go watch The Hateful Eight and you see a snowy mountain and Tarantino doesn't outright tell you where the carriage is that's traveling on this mountain, you don't get to complain about not understanding what's happening. It's all in the discovery. I'm gonna leave it at that.\r Now time for praise. If you'll sit back and relax, you will get so much out of this movie. If you are on the edge of your seat, the same will happen. There are so many moment that are just eye-popping. The soft moments are tender, sweet, and necessary for the wonderful pacing. The actors are stellar, especially RDJ in what is my favorite performance from him yet. Seriously guys, that **** killed his mom. Root for RDJ once in a while. Zemo is a bit confusing on the first watch, but is so much better on the second. GUYS!!! Watch movies more than once. You're supposed to. You can't get everything out of one watch.\r Now for the highest praise out of the whole movie: Three characters. Spiderman. Black Panther. And Giant Man. You heard me. I won't say more because you just have to experience the dedication these characters add to this movie."

      "text": "The fights in this movie are not very believable. In the original Avengers the friendly fights were done in the forest so no one will get hurt and there's not much to destroy. In Civil War the characters are doing ungodly amounts of destruction to everything around them. All of this while the characters claim to 'still be friends' making it even more ridiculous. Hello, aren't we trying to make amends for the destruction we caused in the previous movies? And what is Cap's end game? Does he honestly believe he can go up against the entirety of the UN?\r The pacing also needs a lot of work. It falls into the classic trap so many Marvel movies are falling into recently of going much too slow in the beginning and going incredibly fast at the end. I think it's much worse in Civil War and other global scope movies than say Ant-Man because we're constantly jumping back and forth between random locations with minimal context.\r Also the story is weak. This is the problem with cliffhanger movies. They just don't have any obvious conflict in them. It's just one meandering story with no obvious end. There's just no build up or suspense. Just people fighting each other for the flimsiest of reasons."

      "text": "Captain America: Civil War was alright. Too many characters and calling them by various names being its biggest sins, as it simply makes it hard to follow. The action scenes are poorly done and solely done in the name of, \"oh that's badass\" or \"oh he/she is hot\". Even worse, they are poorly shot and wholly disorienting when they occur. The quips can be funny, but the comedic timing is dreadful and undermines potentially serious moments. Even worse, I f***king hate Iron Man. I hated him before this movie. I hate him now and he's like half the movie. The Iron Man movies are the only Marvel ones I do not like and it is because of how much of a whiny, self-righteous brat his character is that I truly despise him. This ultimately hurt here and made the overall film incredibly underwhelming. That said, the new character introductions are appropriately epic and done very well. The film is incredibly entertaining with good fight scenes (minus the disorientation), it is funny, and the disagreement is very well laid out as opposed to the film about the sons of Marthas. The acting is more than acceptable here and thoroughly feels like a comic book movie. Overall, after enjoying the first two Captain America's, Civil War was wholly underwhelming due to Iron Man and being overstuffed with characters (who are referred to by their real name and superhero name interchangeably). Civil War did not live up to my hopes."

It resembles a lot like Anakin vs. Obi Wan in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith.\r* The visual effects\r* Robert Downey, Jr.'s dark performance as Iron Man. It contrasts to all the Iron Man performances he has done over the years.\r* Chris Evan's performance as Captain America\r* The casting choice for Spider-Man, Tom Holland. He looks just like Peter Parker despite the flaws from the writing.\rCriticism\r* The title of the movie being the third installment of Captain America instead of just calling it \"Marvel's Civil War.\"\r* Too much characters who don't resemble at all to the Captain America franchise, including Black Panther, Scarlet Witch, The Vision, and especially, Spider-Man.\r* Special criticism: SPIDER-MAN. He was supposed to be a very inspiring character with huge emotional background and very trustworthy to fight with. I prefer to call him, Peter Parker, \"Jr.\" because he wasn't that young in the comics when he became Spider-Man. He got bitten by a spider during his senior year of high school. I really hate how they presented Spider-Man in the MCU because it doesn't relate at all to how Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield portrayed him. Tom Holland was better than Tobey Maguire, but not as good as Andrew Garfield, because Garfield put a lot of emotion and heart while in the suit. In this movie, Peter said it's been 6 months since he got his powers, but he never explained why he became Spider-Man to being with. That reason will always be Uncle Ben. When Spider-Man said, \"Holy **** when Ant-Man grew, it literally killed my childhood. So, **** you, Marvel.\r* Aunt May's casting choice was the worst. It's a way to make humor gimmicks like Iron Man flirting with her in front of Peter. Ugh!\r* Civil War was supposed to be the darkest of the MCU, instead there was too much humor and too much meme references to mock.\r* The Vision wearing human clothes. Are you ****ing kidding me?!\r* It was meant to a Captain America movie, but they barely even focused on him. They focused more on the supporting characters than the actual main character.\r* Stan Lee calling Stark, \"Stank.\" Imagine replacing \"t\" with a \"k.\"\r* Special criticism: No deaths involved. Marvel is so much of a **** that can't kill off any character in Civil War.\r* Part Two of Special Criticism: The comic, Civil War, was supposed to be the most devastating storyline to be put in Marvel. What the hell was Feige thinking not resembling the majority of a darker tone from the comic to the movie? In the trailer, we assumed that War Machine was going to die and have Iron Man avenge him by fighting off Captain America even more. Nope, he gets paralyzed in the leg. That shot from The Vision could have killed him even before the fall.\r* Part Three of Special Criticism: The most significant part of the comic was the aftermath of Civil War: THE DEATH OF CAPTAIN AMERICA. In the end of the comic, Steve Rogers gets assassinated by a hypnotized Sharon Carter during his conference at the White House. This made a huge impact to the Avengers. Iron Man mourns for Captain America and regrets signing the Ant-Registration Act, including the harm he put into The Avengers. Iron Man was so mournful enough to recreate S.H.I.E.L.D. (New Avengers Initiative). Sharon Carter encourages Bucky Barnes to fulfill Steve Rogers's role as Captain America. He refuses until he finally remembers his entire friendship with him and Steve. He gazes at the suit and experiences hope. I wanted to see that as the end of the movie, BUT NOW I CAN'T. In the movie, Captain America is still alive and Bucky Barnes freezes himself again with no motivation (other than until the hypnotism wares off, but that doesn't count). What the hell have you done, Kevin Feige?"

Anyone that appreciates good, QUALITY movie making will abhor this film.\r The plot wasn't bad....brought up some serious issues by giving both sides.  The direction was HORRIBLE!!!! Typical of the last two Superman and Bourne movies..... you have an amateur director who thinks that handheld cameras jumping around fighting and chase sequences in close-ups is exciting.  Add to that, extremely choppy editing, and you have a hodgepodge of odd spliced action that you can't make heads or tails out of it.  The action scenes had a lot of speeded up CGI  fast movements that were annoyingly unrealistic.\r Most young viewers are probably used to this type of directing and don't know how great action pictures should be shot.

I haven't had a feeling like this walking out of a superhero movie since The Dark Knight, and I'd be inclined to say that it might be the best comic book movie ever since The Dark Knight.\r The action. The airport scene is hands down the best action scene in any comic book movie ever. Not just this, but chase scene with Bucky and Black Panther was just awesome, and the final action scene is shocking, dark, and surprisingly violent for a Marvel movie. Pretty much the only thing you could criticize about the action in this movie is the shaky cam in the first few fights, but it wears off later on.\r The characters. Spider-Man!! F**K YES! FINALLY.... A PERFECT DEPICTION OF HIM! Tobey was a crappy spider-man and a great Peter Parker, and Andrew Garfield was a great spider-man and a crappy Peter Parker, but Tom Holland knocks it out of the park for both! Chadwick Boseman also played an amazing Black Panther. And best of all, they both play completely essential roles in the movie! Not just shoehorned in at the end. The rest of the cast (Cap, IM, BW, etc., etc.) is as awesome as they've always been if not better. But forget about all that, because it's time to talk about who is possibly the most underrated villain EVER! There's pretty much been no above average villains in the MCU up to this point besides Loki and The Winter Soldier (If you would count him as a villain), but this guy honestly breaks the trend. Zemo's motivations made complete sense and he wasn't just an over the top ridiculous antagonist. And if you think about it, he actually caused the most damage to the Avengers out of any MCU villain...\r Finally, the story. We all knew going into this movie that it wasn't going to be on nearly as big of a scale as the Civil War comic, but integrating the Civil War into a Cap movie like this is pretty genius. At it's core, this is a sequel to Winter Soldier. In that, Bucky Barnes is completely integral to the plot and the way they link his backstory to Iron Man is just phenomenal. The movie is two and a half hours long, and it absolutely doesn't feel like that, because it's so well paced and there's never that one moment where you aren't glued to the screen. Although admittedly the movie didn't take too many \"risks\", I understand why.\r In the end, like I said before, in my humble opinion, this is the best Marvel movie to date and is also the best CBM ever since TDK. In fact, the way it leaves you at the end of the movie feels a lot like TDK. In my mind, this is the first chapter of the end of the line that the MCU has been leading up to. And that makes me simultaneously sad that we're approaching the end, but super happy that the end is oh so FANT4STIC! Oh yeah, f**k that movie."

He was very good but he didn't seem to fit in with the overall story. And the side-plot involving him was one of the elements that had been a worry for the movie; that it wouldn't be a true Captain America movie as it wouldn't be about him as much as it should've.\r The movie was built up around the Accords but they pretty much were forgotten for the entire second half and it just became about Iron Man wanting to prove himself right over Captain America. They were the motivation, yes, but that became very hard to see by the time of the airport fight scene. And of course there was a lot of time given to the other Winter Soldiers but then it cut off when he killed them. A twist, yes, but one which wasted massive amount of film time. The fight scenes were decent but some of the employed elements, such as Ant-Man's surprise, were rather surprising--and not in the good way. It was the sort of thing that really didn't belong in a group hero movie.\r When it comes to movies about conflicting ideals, especially when, as in this case, both sides make solid and understandable points, it is usually important to give both sides their due so, even if one wins, both are understood. And it had that covered quite well early on with Tony's guilt and Steve's hero complex, but that theme was lost somewhere along the lines. Eventually Tony's team (minus Natasha) seemed composed of people seeking revenge (T'Challa), gratification (Tony), or just following blindly (Spiderman+Rhodey). There wasn't even any pressing NEED for them to fight, and that was what made the movie as a whole rather hard to swallow.\r Characterization, as with the plot, began well before taking a nosedive about halfway. There was a nice base, each character given their due and specific reasons to support their side, but as the difference in opinions arose it was lost by the wayside. Some of the most important elements were forgotten in place of cheap drama; Tony became a hothead with no care for Steve (a feature which was the entire point of Ultron), Peter became a fanboy without the ability to think for himself, and T'Challa sought revenge with no other thought through his head. (Or, for the record, explanation for his own abilities and suit beyond a passing comment of it being an heirloom.)\r All-in-all the movie gave the feeling that they were heading in one direction beforehand but a last-minute change forced them to scrounge for an alternative ending. Not quite bad, but shall we say... lacking."

      "text": "As someone who isn't crazy about superhero movies, I can't help but be impressed by Marvel, and just how far their stories and characters have progressed in such a short time. Arguably the best of those characters is Captain America, simply because he's the one character people are most likely to relate to. The Captain isn't a billionaire or a king, and he doesn't have super abilities from another planet, he's just this wholesome, level headed guy, who you can't help but like. In his third feature film, Captain America (Chris Evans) comes into conflict with other members of the Avengers, as following a tragedy, the world governments decide the Avengers shouldn't be free to do whatever they want anymore. Some of them agree, some of them don't, and that's where the split occurs, leading to one of the best fight scenes I have ever seen. When I saw the previews for this film, I couldn't understand why the story wasn't used for an Avengers film. Even while watching it, I noticed that much of the focus isn't solely on Captain America, and I became even more convinced. This film was not a true stand alone like we've seen in the past, and that's because I think it was more of a transitional project than anything else. Clearly it seems as though Marvel is putting Captain America on the shelf for a while and trying to draw our attention to the new Spider-man series, starring Tom Holland. I must admit, I have never really liked Spider-man. I always saw him as bland and weak compared to the rest of the Marvel universe, but Tom Holland changed my mind in this film. He was all personality, in a way that Toby McGuire and Andrew Garfield couldn't even imagine. The charisma this good looking young actor puts out there should be enough to get anyone excited for the new series. As far as this film goes, the story was a bit complicated, and in my opinion there are far too many characters involved for this to be titled Captain America. In that sense I was disappointed, because I love the character, and was looking forward to another feature film about him. On the other hand, amazing new characters were added, a major story line was introduced into the Avengers genre, and I got to see the best action sequence I've ever seen, so while it wasn't what I expected, I still highly recommend seeing this film."

This is an exhausting mess, although not completely without its moments. I did enjoy some of it but let me break this down for you. We have the first hour of nothing, politics, more nothing, contracts, discussions, and one of the worst edited fight scenes I have ever seen (I'm talking Quantum of Solace bad) honestly, skip it. The last hour is Captain America getting overshadowed by every other character in the damn movie. And smack bam in the middle is a 20 minute introduction to our friendly neighbourhood Spiderman. Meet 12 year old Spidey make his not so amazing entrance that really made me want to jump into the movie and slap him in the face. Would I recommended it?

      "text": "Another great release for the Marvel Cinematic Universe and an excellent conclusion to what I think is their strongest lone superhero films: the Captain America trilogy. I believe the first Captain America film was another fun Marvel superhero movie, but with Winter Soldier and now Civil War the bar was certainly raised for the MCU. Within Civil War there is the classic humor, but it still maintains a much more serious and pressing plot, pitting friends against each other and dividing the Avengers team. The film's action is unparalleled as far as the rest of the Marvel films and Downey's Iron Man performance as well as Evans and the rest of the cast's acting is great. I thought the creators did a very good job of letting all the superheroes have their moments of glory, as well as introducing new players like Black Panther and Spider-man (both awesome), while still keeping the primary focus on Captain America and his loyalty to Bucky, his lifelong friend. A must-see for general movie fans, not just superhero fans. 8.5/10. Side note: the airport scene is incredible."

      "text": "First thing, if you have not seen previous Marvel movies, specially Captain America and Avengers, do not watch this movie, because you will have a chaos in the story lines. This movie has many similar aspects with DC Batman vs Superman movie. It is interesting to compare these two movies, because here is very visible difference and how it should be in BvS movie. Reason why BvS does not make sense and this movie does is, that Marvel created a story for every character, so you know who are they, why are they the story and what problems they have to solve. This movie is great in visual, but I have a problem with some action scenes. Sorry, but we are in 2016 and some of the scenes looks ridiculous and absurd, when, for example, human-hero survive bomb  explosion just because he jump away from the bomb, but the bomb explode just about 2-3 m far behind him. The movie tries to be more darker and solve some serious moral superhero questions, but some jokes in thrilling moments are just not suitable and damage this serious atmosphere. I do not want have spoilers hare, so about the story - it is not bad, but could be better. Sometimes raises some questions like \"Why is he/she (not) doing this?\".  The movie is more focused to action scenes and visual effect. It is not bad movie, have many good aspects, but previous Marvel movies had better quality for me."

      "text": "The cast, once again, as usual, is a standout. Chris Evans still proves that he is Captain America, distilling in him doubt and a questioning manner, while also showing him as a conflicted and true leader. Evans commands the film and ever scenes that he is in, proving that the Marvel Cinematic Universe isn't complete without the character. Robert Downey Jr. once again proves that he is Tony Stark and that no other actor can depict the character. Downey takes a backseat to Evans in good fashion and doesn't try to take the film away from him. This is more Captain America, than Iron Man, with Stark only arriving into the film when necessary and never hogging the film away from Evans. Downey and Evans work well together, while successfully showing the different sides of both characters: Captain America as the leader and Tony Stark as the billionaire, who after the events of Age of Ultron, is guilt ridden. His decision to favor oversight comes from a civilian in Sokovia being killed during the battle, which has a huge impact over the film. Sebastian Stan makes a welcome return to Bucky Barnes, the brainwashed friend of Captain America, code-named the Winter Soldier. Once again this character proves that the Captain America trilogy is about one thing: brotherly love. Stan's depiction brings a sense of doubt and confusion, since he still trying to piece his entire life together, while it also partly ties certain events together. Scarlett Johansson is marvelous as always as Black Widow, delivering great lines and working well opposite both Evans and Downey. Anthony Mackie is once again amazing as Falcon, Captain America's new ally. Don Cheadle still works well with Downey and in the role of James Rhodes, having replaced Terence Howard in Iron Man 2. Jeremy Renner makes a great, small appearance as Hawkeye, as does Paul Rudd as Ant-Man, lending a sense of comedy to the film and giant surprises. Paul Bettany depicts Vision as an android attempting to come to grips with the world, while Elizabeth Olsen gets to further explore the character of Scarlet Witch, sharing some really great scenes with Bettany. William Hurt makes a welcome return to the MCU as Thunderbolt Ross, now Secretary of State. This approach seems to be done as a way to still make clear that The Incredible Hulk (the black sheep of the MCU) is still part of the universe. Hurt shows Ross as a complicated politician. Frank Grillo makes a great, small appearance as Rumlow at the beginning, while Emily VanCamp makes a welcome return as Sharon Carter and Martin Freeman is introduced to the MCU in a small role as Everett Ross, who will undoubtedly return for future installments. The real standouts in the film are Tom Holland as Spider-Man and Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther. Holland steals the scenes that he is in as Spider-Man, working exceptionally well opposite Evans and Downey, as well as Marisa Tomei, who depicts Aunt May. Holland is comedic, depicting the character as a nervous, geeky, unsure character. Holland seems to be the definitive version of the character, delivering a far better performance of the character than Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, the two of whom are also fine actors. While some may say that Spider-Man is only featured in the film to introduce him into the MCU and also to setup the planned standalone film, I believe that Spider-Man worked out well in the film and lend a real sense of stamina to the film, especially the big fight. Boseman is amazing as Black Panther, delivering the character with menace and true purpose. Boseman is calm as the character, while the introduction is wild and spectacular. Daniel Bruhl makes a great appearance as the villain Zemo, who has a huge connection to the events of the film. While the character is different in the comic books, I can defend the change that had to be done, since it supports the film's plot and layout. Bruhl's approach to the character, as a calm and calculating villain, as well as the villain itself is spectacular, while he has got to be the best villain that the universe has had to see so far. The idea of having a normal, regular human face off against the Avengers is smart and total genius on the part of the filmmakers."

The action is average and the pacing is terrible, but the overall divide between Stark and Cap is clear and believable, which is what really matters most. However, the film is not always terribly clear why the others picked the side that they chose. This is most obvious with Clint and Scarlet Witch, both of whom seem very out of character with the choices that they make. It is worth noting that this may be my favorite villain from all of the Marvel movies so far.\r The stark difference between the critical reviews of Civil War and Dawn of Justice is utterly baffling to me. The films share similar strengths and similar weaknesses. Both film studios need to straight up fire their editing crews, because Civil War (like DoJ) suffers from jarringly bad editing. Where DoJ suffers from scattershot editing that puts together the scenes in an unintuitive way, Civil War seems to start and stop multiple times before it finally hits its stride about halfway through the film. This is made even more clunky as the film tries to introduce multiple new characters without ever slimming down the main cast. Fortunately the new heroes are all well played. Also, Civil War's actors are often talking off-screen even during pedestrian conversations, and it's really obvious that the two actors are not in the same room, which dramatically weakens a couple key scenes."

In general, the film manipulation deserves honorable 7 points and my respect, and remains at the level of the remaining parts of Captain America. If you're a fan of Marvel, or even movie-comics, then be sure to view, and if you are an ordinary viewer, who is not familiar with the universe, you can not even walk, still does not understand.

Admittedly this is a few notches up from previous efforts and, despite a patchy and inconsistent screenplay there is actually a germ of a good story being played out, albeit at monstrously excessive length. The mystery surrounding the deaths of Iron Man\u2019s parents; the brief introduction of additional warriors and a fantastic stunt set piece involving Captain America and a helicopter are all plot points or moments that promise much. Unfortunately, pasting such highlights between endless fights and battles ensure that the story\u2019s flow becomes a stop start affair. These action sequences are not only lengthy and unimaginatively staged, but are also loaded with the usual tiresome banter and unfunny lines which severely disjoint the passably good story and seem to have become a staple ingredient of these films. Technically the achievements are good enough, but it has to be said that the cinematography is very dark for much of the time. Also, the special effects whilst perfectly acceptable are not really showcasing anything new. Fans will, I\u2019m sure, lap it all up. However, even as I contemplate this certainty the one question that keeps wanting to be asked is WHY?"

Okay I am now explaining the plot but seriously it was handled greatly and make sense cause we know why they fight and why they where split.You will be confused of which side are you on cause both men are right in their respective ideologies.Marvel did a great job between the Punisher and Daredevil's ideologies and why not do a great one in \"Civil War\".\r So Captain America:Civil War is Marvel's strongest film with a plot that works,characters that we love emphasizes their abilities and powers and stay lovable. Action sequences that was fun to watch.It destroys Age of Ultron and is the best movie in the Cap's Trilogy.This is a fun summer movie.I recommend this."
