      "text": "Published in 1991, Bret Easton Ellis' third novel was greeted by howls of hatred more appropriate to a small war in the Third World or another Golan-Globus Lemon Popsicle sequel. A first person report from inside the mind of Patrick Bateman, who epitomises the ills of the 1980s by combining the professions of Wall Street broker (\"mergers and acquisitions\") and serial killer (\"murders and executions\"), the book was widely misinterpreted as a hideously misogynist tract that used explicit violence to draw attention to a thinly-plotted pretend thriller with dollops of surface-level satire.\r There has always been the threat of a film, with such scary names as Oliver Stone, Brian De Palma and David Cronenberg in the ring - but the project has fallen to Mary Harron, the ex-BBC documentarian who made an underrated debut with I Shot Andy Warhol, who has cannily brought aboard the apparently unlikely Guinevere Turner (the lesbian icon from Go Fish) to co-write and play the funniest victim. The result is the best imaginable film of very difficult material; it doesn't say much more than, \"The 80s were **** but manages exactly to catch the all-surfaces, dazzlingly obsessive tone of the novel, making its points by treating all subjects - nouvelle cuisine, MOR rock music, fitness kicks, clothes, personal grooming - with exactly the same pornographic attention to detail as the sex and violence.\r Like the book, the film makes a point of not having a real plot: a smooth PI (Dafoe) seems set to nail the killer for the murder of a rival trader (Leto), but fades into the wallpaper along with the crime itself. Bateman, played with dead-inside charm and mounting hysteria by an astonishing Christian Bale, invites us into his world of reservations at exclusive restaurants and competitions over the quality of business cards. His detours into murder - prefaced by detailed speeches about now-embarrassing musical enthusiasms (\"You actually own a Whitney Houston CD?\" gasps Turner through contemptuous laughter. \"More than one?\") - are hardly more bizarre and tasteless as everything else in his life. In the end, the scariest thing about Bateman is not that he's a Lecter-like freak - his crack-up in the last act brings him horribly closer to humanity - but that he is no worse than everyone else in his world, except humane-but-dim office minion Sevigny, whose role is to make the film bearable.\r As for the horror: Harron is mostly very discreet, but delivers one terrific apartment-of-grue sequence as Bateman's life falls to pieces along with many victims, featuring a truly nerve-shredding chainsaw sound effect.\r Often laugh-out-loud funny, conveying the cruelty of its world through persistent mistakings of identity among the well-scrubbed young men and details like the all-sharp-edges interior decor and elaborate but tiny meals, it's cool in the sense of remote rather than hip. And you wouldn't want to be seen dead with the soundtrack album."

It's a joke we would like to think we've got.

In adapting Bret Easton Ellis's turgid, gory 1991 novel to the screen, the director Mary Harron has boiled a bloated stew of brand names and butchery into a lean and mean horror comedy classic. The transformation is so surprising that when the movie's over, it feels as if you've just seen a magician pull a dancing rabbit out of a top hat.\r Four years ago Ms. Harron's film \"I Shot Andy Warhol\" performed similar magic by creating credible facsimiles of Warhol and his motley entourage. \"American Psycho,\" a more ambitious, far more confident film, salvages a novel widely loathed for its putative misogyny and gruesome torture scenes by removing its excess fat in a kind of cinematic liposuction. Except for a few wittily chosen lists, the book's numbing catalog of high-end consumer items has been drastically edited. Its murder rate has also plunged. The trimming demonstrates once again that less is often more. What remains of the story is a sleek, satirical, yuppie-era \"Jekyll and Hyde\" that blithely tap dances along the fault lines separating movie genres.\r At the heart of the film is a star-making performance by the handsome Welsh actor Christian Bale (adopting an impeccably snooty pseudo-preppie American accent) that softens the novel's portrait of a serial-killing Wall Street hotshot just enough to force us to identify with this ultimate narcissist. Mr. Bale's portrayal of 27-year-old Patrick Bateman, a budding master of the universe by day (he works in mergers and acquisitions, which he facetiously refers to as \"murders and executions\") and homicidal maniac by night, is alternately funny, blood-curdling and pathetic.\r As this character metamorphoses from preening, wolfish yuppie to chain-saw wielding maniac to whimpering crybaby, Mr. Bale makes us feel the underlying connections between these multiple personalities. One minute Mr. Bale's Patrick is a cowering corporate geek and self-described empty shell, the next an arrogant, name-dropping smoothie, the next a hysterical wimp unable to distinguish reality from fantasy.\r He's also a serial killer, or at least he is in his imagination. The movie plays adroitly with the notion that his violent spasms are merely the revenge fantasies of a repressed corporate toady. The fluidity with which Mr. Bale moves from one state of mind to the other makes for the kind of tour-de-force performance you'd expect from Sean Penn, another master of throwing tear-stained tantrums.\r From the opening credits, in which drops of blood are confused with red berry sauce drizzled on an exquisitely arranged plate of nouvelle cuisine, the movie establishes its insidious balance of humor and aestheticized gore. That sly confusion between the beautiful and the gruesome extends to the language of the screenplay by Ms. Harron and Guinevere Turner.\r Dinner specials are described by waiters in the tones of unctuous coroners announcing the results of autopsies.\r Some of the funniest speeches are Patrick's pompous lectures -- each a prelude to homicide -- on the 80's pop stalwarts Phil Collins, Whitney Houston, and Huey Lewis and the News.\r While the movie's interiors conform to late-80's styles of design and architecture, they, too, are eerily exaggerated. The severe black-and-white minimalism of Patrick's gadget-filled apartment has the feel of a high-rise morgue.\r The movie's sexual ethos is a bifurcated world of male monsters and their often shallow but still recognizably human girlfriends. Patrick and his Wall Street cronies are interchangeable reptilian pod people, soulless under their designer-label shells and supercilious smirks. (One running joke finds Patrick being continually confused with others, despite his wealth, status and miraculous instant entree to New York's priciest restaurants.)\r In one hilarious early scene, he and his colleagues compare their business cards (the texture of the paper and the quality of embossing) in a competitive game of show and tell that has a murderous undertone. Those colleagues, wittily embodied by Jared Leto, Justin Theroux, Matt Ross and Bill Sage, are the ne plus ultra in cocky, carnivorous sang-froid.\r Compared with these robotic cobras, the women are almost poignantly human. Reese Witherspoon,\r At the very least, \"American Psycho\" is a dazzling period satire. It's still too early to know what, if anything, it might foretell."

      "text": "American Psycho is one of the most deranged yet enjoyable stories ever committed to film. A satire of the \"yuppie\" lifestyle of the 1980s, and a warning against the corrupting power of money, it's expertly told, well-scripted, somewhat disturbingly funny, and grusomely thrilling. The entire film pretty much hinges on one performance, that of Christian Bale's increasingly disturbed Wall Street trader-by-day and serial killer-by-night Patrick Bateman. Bale doesn't disappoint, delivering the performance of his career, and in the process creating a horror villain to rival Norman Bates, and an anti-hero and chillingly disturbing narrator to rival Alex DeLarge. Comparissons to such films as Psycho and A Clockwork Orange are inevitable, and American Psycho could be seen as an affectionate tribute to both, but with its own ideas to add to the bubbling cauldron of depravity. All these films use madness as a metaphor for something wrong with society - in Psycho it's misogyny, in A Clockwork Orange it's the corruption of government, and in American Psycho it's the evils of capitalism. The films are similar in many ways, amd vastly different in others, but all three communicate a powerful message to their audience extremely effectively. American Psycho certainly deserves equal recognition as a film - the performances are just as good, the story just as engaging, the underlying themes just as dark and compelling. Even director Mary Harron shows great flair in her art, though sadly as a cult film director she is unlikely to be classed in the same league as so-called \"masters\" as **** and Kubrick. If you enjoy the film, cult icon as it is, then feel free to be smug in the fact that you and a select group of others appreciate a truly fine, though criminally underrated film."

      "text": "Christian Bale is all around the film all the way through and this is why his character is age 27 and well educated and that is why he's born in 1974. I absolutely love Christian Bale's performance. He really does give his performance a lot of humor and horror which I don't think this movie is scary to be honest. There are some 80's songs which I absolutely love. They completely fit to the film in the late 1980's. I'm surprised that the filmmakers didn't put any 90's songs in it. Maybe it's because the novel seems written in the 80's.The 80's songs are:New Order - True Faith.You're a f&$%!^g ugly b\u00a3$%h. I want to stab you to death, and then play around with your blood.Katrina and the Waves - Walking on Sunshine.Robert Palmer - Simply Irresistible.I'm trying to listen to the new Robert Palmer tape, but Evelyn, my supposed fiancee, keeps buzzing in my ear.Huey Lewis and the News - Hip To Be Square.Do you like Huey Lewis and the News? They're OK. Their early work was a little too new wave for my tastes, but when Sports came out in '83, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humour. Hey Halberstram. Yes, Allen? Why are there copies of the style section all over the place, d-do you have a dog? A little chow or something? No, Allen? Is that a rain coat? Yes it is! In '87, Huey released this, Fore, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is ''Hip To Be Square'', a song so catchy' most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity, and the importance of trends, it's also a personal statement about the band itself. Hey Paul! (Screams) TRY GETTING A RESERVATION AT DORSIA NOW, YOU F&^%ING STUPID B\u00a3$%^&D! (Screams) YOU F&^%ING B\u00a3$%^&D!Chris de Burgh - Lady in Red.Simply Red - If You Don't Know Me By Now.Genesis - In Too Deep.Do you like Phil Collins? I've been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before that, I really didn't understand any of their work. Too artsy, too intellectual. it was on Duke where Phil Collins' presence became more apparent. I think Invisible Touch was the group's undisputed masterpiece. It's an epic meditation and on intangibility. At the same time, it deepens an enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums. Christy, take off the robe. Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks, Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance of every instrument. Sabrina, remove you dress. In terms of lyrical craftsmanship, the sheer songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism. Sabrina, why don't you, uh, dance a little. Take the lyrics to Land of Confusion. In this song, Phil Collins addresses the problems of abusive political authority. In To Deep is the most moving pop song in the 1980s, about monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything I've heard in rock. Christy, get down on your knees so Sabrina can see your a$$hole. Phil Collins' solo career seems to be more commercial and therefore satisfying, in a narrower way. Especially songs like In The Air Tonight and Against All Odds. Sabrina, don't just stare at it, eat it. But I also think Phil Collins works best within the confines of the group, than as a solo artist, and I stress the word artist.Phil Collins - Sussudio.This is Sussudio, a great, great song, a personal favourite.Curiosity Killed The Cat - Red Lights.Whitney Houston - Greatest Love Of All. Do you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP, called simply Whitney Houston had 4 number one singles on it? Did you know that, Christy? You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You've own a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?' It's hard to choose a favourite among so many great tracks, but ''The Greatest Love Of All'' is one of the best, most powerful songs ever written about self-preservation, dignity. It's universal message crosses all boundaries and installs one with the hope that it's not late to better ourselves. Since, Elizabeth, it's impossible in this world we live in to empathize with others, we can always empathize with ourselves. It's an important message, crucial really. And it's beautifully stated on the album.(Whooh!) That's a lot of thought that I've been working on! There's just so many speeches that I have to put in what Christian Bale's character says. Well, that's the way it goes, folks. Brilliantly directed and acted by Christian Bale. Nothing can go wrong with the movie."

Harron's direction is very impressive as she manages to take the story through the narrow route that blurs the line between fiction and reality with great finesse. American Psycho is a fascinating vignette of lunacy and obsession as it intriguingly blends its elements of horror and dark comedy into an exquisitely paced, masterfully directed and magnificently written story that delves into the mind and psyche of its incredibly deranged individual with plenty of success, and remains one of the finest achievements of its genre(s) and of the greatest movies of the 2000s."

      "text": "American Psycho is a strangely satisfying film.One of the weirdest movies I've seen. Saw on video tape when it came out then recently watched it again 18 years later. Forgot how fun it is to watch. The absurdity of Bale's character Patrick Bateman's shallowness and preoccupation with superficial things like how upset he gets over a colleague having a better business card than him makes this movie comedic while he's slicing up victims. Still not sure about whether or not all of the things happening were all in his head. I guess that's up for anyone's interpretation of the story. Very well done and one of Bale's best performances as if he's ever performed badly."

According to co-writer and director Mary Harron, Bale saw in Cruise \"this very intense friendliness with nothing behind the eyes,\" and Bale subsequently based the character of Bateman on that. Interestingly, Tom Cruise is actually featured in the novel. He lives in the same apartment complex as Bateman, who meets him in an elevator and gets the name of Cocktail (1988) wrong, calling it \"Bartender.\""

This movie was just so fun and bat **** crazy to watch, the acting was superb and I enjoyed the **** outta the times when he casually started explaining different albums and songs and their meanings before doing the deed. The ending was very good for its time, I won't go into details about the philosophical aspects of the movie and what its trying to say about society for example since it was already explained and analyzed to dead. There were a bit of slow parts and some awkward acting but overall its a must see movie if you haven't already."
