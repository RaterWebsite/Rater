But it's all totally wasted by a wasted final act, once the violence starts. If you aren't picky, give it a shot. Otherwise, you can do much much better."

      "text": "This is the directorial debut of Dave Franco, and stars his real-life wife Alison Brie ('Community', Netflix's 'GLOW'), along with Dan Stevens ('Beauty and the Beast') as a married couple who, along with the husband's younger brother and his girlfriend, decide to get away for the weekend in a cliffside rental home. But things soon start to turn suspicious around them as they sense that someone might be watching them. The film and its cast and premise intrigued me, and the first half of the film started off promising enough, building up a tense and rather eerie tone and atmosphere. However, much to my dismay, the film never really picked up or went anywhere interesting in the second half, as it began to seemingly lose its sense of direction. To cap it all off, the final 10 mins or so were far too vague and left too many unanswered questions, making the film an its ordeal simply feel random and pointless. Overall, the film showed potential to begin with, but the whole thing was pretty much ruined by an underwhelming and increasingly predictable second half that lacks any true thrills, as well as an ending that leaves no motives or explanations to speak of, making it very difficult for me to care about everything that preceded it."

      "text": "This story was a great disappointment. Moderately written characters that sometimes filled superfluous scenes with dialogues that didn't matter. This resulted in a very long build-up to the core of the story. When the tension came, I hoped for more depth from the dangerous person in this story. That did not happen. At the end the film felt like an empty shell."

Pero al menos entretiene bastante."

      "text": "Loved the movie.Marking Dave Franco's directorial debut, this sharp, engrossing horror-thriller gets by with no supernatural elements, relying entirely on scarily believable human behavior and intrusive technology. Working from a screenplay co-written by Franco, Joe Swanberg, and Mike Demski, Franco creates tension right away in The Rental with his human tableaus. Even the (sometimes dark) humor is designed to throw things off-balance. The very first shot shows Charlie and Mina leaning together over a computer monitor in such a familiar, comfortable way that we may immediately assume that they're a couple.Everything in the movie is staged in a way that creates tension and dislocation, from Taylor's underlying racism and his sly way of deflecting it to Michelle being out-of-step with the other three. Michelle is the only one interested in going on a hike, and she takes ecstasy alone on Saturday night, becoming a kind of quirky comic relief and also a catalyst for more disaster. Brie and Franco are married in real life, and he's given her a rich role here that plays to her talents. Plus, Franco manages to comment on technology in a way that's subtle and not overbearing. He doesn't go easy on his characters, and he finds an ending that clicks into place with a true shudder. In essence, The Rental is a must-see thriller, both smart and unsettling."

      "text": "Two couples spend a casual weekend at a beautiful rental by the ocean. When the caretaker comes off as creepy, it begins a tense ride with an atypical ending. Even as the characters and their relationships are being established, there are signs that something sinister is impending. When it comes to pass, we're treated to a suspenseful thrill ride of tension and scares. The most impressive part: The first-time director is actor Dave Franco (little brother of multi-hyphenate James). He has a strong sense of effective storytelling and even manages to make the genre's typical tropes work to his advantage."

      "text": "This is a different horror film than we\u2019re used to seeing. It\u2019s an independent, short, and simple horror/thriller. I might call it mumblegore since it relies on naturalistic acting of 20/30-year olds and a low budget. It follows a pair of couples staying in a rental house, when they realize something strange and creepy is happening. The film has some things I appreciate like characters blatantly calling out racist characters\u2019 microaggressions and a plot that subverts expectations. However, the film is weak in its motivations and the sense of emptiness it carries. There\u2019s not much going on and some plot decisions are strange and frustrating, in a sense that it ruins parts of the movie. Overall, my favorite part of the film was probably how interesting the montage scene is."

I mean, I'd expect a little consistency, but the sense sometimes tends to slip away.Something like this occurs with The Rental.A film that initially looks like a couples drama but ends up becoming a horror story.In principle it might sound interesting but even considering the short length, The Rental is a story where only things happen because they must happen and then they end abruptly.Zero story development and one-dimensional shallow characters. A recurring note in horror films of this kind.There's sufficient talent in Franco's craftsmanship, and it's going to be interesting to see if he can grow as a filmmaker if he decides to continue doing it, but he needs to make a better narrative management and most of all he'll need better scripts, because when the viewer doesn't care about the characters, nor the poor motives, nor the killer, well, there's very little left to hold on to. Is it a failure? Yes. There's nothing worth remembering in this film, except that it's Dave Franco's filmmaking debut. The rest is as ordinary as it sounds."

      "text": "A 2020 horror film based on a deserted holiday home. It turned out to be a mediocre film with all the clich\u00e9s of a similar style. Of course, stereotypes are relevant again. These include crashing into a tree, catching everyone off guard one by one, the strange landlord, etc. As for the subject; two couples, in which men are brothers to each other, rent a forest house. The goal is to smoke marijuana together and drink. Then the older man gets into the shower with the woman, who is also his business partner and his brother's girlfriend. A day later, they see the camera installed in the shower head. Now we understand that this secret will be revealed.And we have a strange killer. Who keeps rented houses, connects cameras to them, watches them from near the house, and then kills those who rent the house.It is not clear what the man's purpose is.The film can not rise above the mediocre. The characters are all repulsive. There are no sexual elements, except for the lovemaking scene in the shower."

      "text": "I really don't understand what most of these people are talking about. Once again it seems that neckbeards and basement dweller virgins are negative bombing something the Franco brothers, do out of envy.The movie begins with two couples on a retreat, the characters are genuine, in the sense that we all know people like this (if you have ever had college friends). The movie goes on threough their common and expected issues between couples and friends before it takes several twists and turns that leave you wondering where is this really going to go.After the troubles with the landlord we are left uncertain to his involvement in everything that's happening, and that's when we see the real antagonist, a serial killer who kills, if for nothing else, out of pleasure. This guy is no nonsense, he doesn't play with his victims nor does he take 30 mins to track them down (looking at you Jason Vorhees) and the best part is that, unlike every single other slasher and scary movie, this guy doesn't get killed by some random teens.We later see that this is a regular activity, his MO is shown to us throughout the credits while he takes on other victims.Being filmed, mugged, killed or just be subjected to any kind of danger is something that is always in the back of our minds when we go to a hotel or to an airbnb, Dave takes this fear and shows us the worst csse scenario.My only criticisms are first, that there are some scenes that feel too much like fillers, I feel that there could've been a bit more character development and second, some of the suspense sounds were a bit too much for me, it made it feel cheesy."
