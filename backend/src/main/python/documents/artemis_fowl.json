Josh Gad is ok, and Colin Farrell is fine as a supporting actor, but they screwed the pooch with the casting of this wooden kid. I\u2019ve read the first novel. I know it\u2019s tough to find some great kid actor like Dakota Fanning, ... but they needed to find someone w a little charm and acting believability. This franchise is dead on arrival."

That broke the logic and brought confusion into the story. The narrating didn't work. It was a gimmick to try to clarified the story. The FX are decent. I though the costumes were pretty bad, especially for the fairies. The soundtrack was ok. I give it 52%. I mainly give this score because Lara McDonnell was really good in her role. Quite frankly, she should have been the main lead in this unfocused story."

      "text": "A movie version of the Artemis Fowl book has been in and out of production since '01. We finally get it, and wow, this wasn't worth it. This a very disappointing adaptation. Especially surprising is that this is brought to us from Disney and director Kenneth Brannagh (Thor, Murder on the Orient Express, Cinderella).The problem is that this is a bunch of quick short scenes and characters thrown at us one after the other with very little impact. Heck, the character of Artemis' friend Juliet (played by Tamara Smart) feels like an afterthought and barely functioning character, used so sparingly despite being around the main action most of the time.I think there was a lot of trouble in editing and reshoots. There is one very clear moment of poor dub work.The barrage of scenes and characters results in a complete and utter lack of being able to become invested or relate to the characters. The only character who feels completely developed is large dwarf Mulch Diggums (Josh Gad). I feel that Disney may have felt he went best with test audiences and pushed all the attention onto him.The biggest issue is the presentation of Artemis Fowl (Ferdia Shaw) himself. He's a criminal genius in the book, but that isn't well represented here. He's still smart, but the choppy editing doesn't much make it feel like he's a master strategist. He's watered down from an antihero to a more traditional protagonist. It's Pinky, Elmyra, and the Brain all over again. The studio feels that an antihero may not sit well with parents and they water the product down. The director and/or studio also tweak Artemis' backstory, which was a mistake. (There are good movie adaptations where they change things. This just isn't one of them). They give a frustratingly basic and uninvolving story for Artemis. The characters' setup scenes are some of the dullest moments. Plus, the backstory pales in comparison to the original. The movie doesn't seem to have much faith in Artemis as he doesn't even seem to the be the main focus. Shaw also gives a rather dull performance.Last complaint: there are a couple moments that look like they might be death scenes, but I don't think they were supposed to be. It's very poorly handled.To the movie's credit, there is a good line once in a while. Gad and Judi Dench as an elf commander do a good job. Nonso Anozie as Artemis' bodyguard seemed like fun, but he just wasn't given enough attention. Being a Brannagh movie, it looks nice but it doesn't quite compare to some of his other recent works.You can avoid this one, especially if you're a fan of the book. It's not painfully bad, just barely functioning."

      "text": "This movie was just strange, when i saw the overwhelmingly negative reviews i thought i would hate this movie when i watched it but i don't. Yes it's a bad movie but almost everything about it was strange.Let's start of with the good. Well Lara McDonnell gave a decent performance as Holly Short, her character had an underdeveloped plot but i liked her performance in the movie. I know i'm in the minority in this but i mostly liked Josh Gad in this movie, yes the narration was unneeded, the grouchy voice was annoying (it's even addressed in the movie) and some of the scenes involving his CGI use was horrible but i enjoyed the charisma and witt he brought in the movie. He played as a tall dwarf and he looked like the only one having fun in that movie so yeah Josh Gad was a silver lining.The concept and potential was there and interesting as well, the first act was not that bad as you are introduced to the other worlds of Artemis Fowl like the fairy kingdom was an interesting concept and the CGI was decent early in the movie too but that potential was never realized. Being a Kenneth Branagh movie some shots looked nice and well directed AT TIMES with some decent set pieces here and there.Now the Bad. Ferdia Shaw who played Artemis Fowl had a hammy performance throughout the movie, at times he seemed too monotone and stoic and the other he seemed to be over-acting, it wasn't a terrible performance as he got a lot better during the third act but that was one of the many problems of the movie. Another problem was how scenes seemed to be stitched together and all over the place. Not to give anything away but the majority of the movie takes place in a House.The runtime is 1hr 30 minutes and it seems some scenes were removed and the pacing was too fast and dodgy as you're not given time to fully flesh out characters and the runtime is just filled with exposition and world building but you're never given time to care about the characters or the plot. Judy Dench also gave a weird performance with a grouchy voice, The CGI got bad real fast and this is a big budget movie mind you especially with some bad action sequences.The heist aspect of the movie took a backseat as most of it was explained through narration which took away any thrill or suspense. The villain was awful as he/she has a generic motivation to take over the world and i don't mind that but there is no backstory or any reason to be invested in the villain so it just ends up being generic movie bad guy 101 oh and he/she has a grouchy voice, i have no idea why this movie had an obsession with grouchy voices.Colin Farrell as Artemis' father had the potential to be an interesting character but as soon as you're introduced to him, he is immediately gone. The adventure aspect is also poorly executed and the way how the main conflict is resolved is just baffling. Like i said the whole movie was strange, Also some scenes drag on and we are talking about a 1hr 30 minute movie here and the story never goes to interesting places and again you never care for the characters. So overall, didn't hate his movie, but it's not a good movie by any means."

Only redeeming quality is the personality Josh Gad managed to give to Mulch Diggums, which is why I give at least 1 point.The changes to the original story are so dramatic that it doesn't deserve the title \"adaptation\" anymore, I'm not even sure \"loosely based\" fits here. It's like the people who made the script didn't even bother to read the books, it's like they just heard what the books are roughly about from someone who read them a decade ago. While he was drunk. Then they got drunk and made this.The changes to some of the main characters traits, race and even sex are something I just can't explain and it's really really insulting. Holly should be \"of dark colour\", she is pale white. Domovoi Butler should be - and this is even plot-related - of Russian-Japanese descent, whose family protected Fowls from around year 1100, he is somehow an African (with Slim Shady dyed hair and obvious fake colored lenses.. I mean seriously who came up with that). \"Julius Root\" should be an angry little cigar-smoking man, not a noble misses M from James Bond. Foaly should be old and hairy, not young and metrosexual. And Mulch Diggums (while the actor gave him a lot of personality) should have looked anything but human.Budget for this cringe-worthy Frankenstein monstrosity was around a third bigger than any of the Lord of the Rings movies.

No longer is Artemis a cold, debonair child prodigy; instead, he comes off as a scared boy trying to understand what is happening around him. Fans of Eoin Colfer's writing style will almost certainly be disappointed by this adaptation. The plot comes off as basic and the characters shallow and underdeveloped. The few scenes that do stay true to the series seem to have been taken out of  the various books published in the Artemis Fowl series and mashed together haphazardly. Despite this, I would say the adaptation is a good way to pass time for young children. It certainly keeps their eyes glued to the screen, as you would expect any fantasy-based film with copious amounts of CGI would.

      "text": "This movie deserves 0 stars. It's not Artemis Fowl and it can't even get by on its own merits as a movie. The story has been completely changed from the books it's supposedly based on to the point where it's completely unrecognizable as Artemis Fowl in any sense. The characters have been completely changed as well. Artemis is meant to be 12-year-old criminal mastermind with the disposition of a Vulcan that was well aware of his family's criminal enterprises for his entire life and brought up to eventually take over for his father and keep their criminal empire running. He detested athletic activity and was always extremely formal, constantly wearing suits even in his down time. His father went missing when he was very young, held by the Russian mafia, and it drove his mother insane. He was left to keep everything going and at 12 he kidnapped a fairy and ransomed her for gold. Though the protagonist, in the first book Artemis was very much the villain. In this movie Artemis is clearly just a kid that is smarter than everybody else. They kept his \"kid genius\" trait and removed everything else. His first appearance in the film is him surfing, something the true Artemis would never have done. He's constantly seen in typical clothing you would expect a kid to wear during the first portion of the film rather than his signature suits. His mother is dead and his father is kidnapped by Opal Koboi, the reoccurring villain that was introduced in the second book and had nothing to do with the Fowl family until Artemis II foiled her schemes. Movie Artemis has an emotional outburst when he learned from a news broadcast that his father is suspected of being a criminal and denies the accusations, eventually having to be dragged away by Butler, who in the movie prefers his first name despite it being a major part of his character in the books that his first name is to remain a secret unless he's dying. Butler is the one that introduces Artemis to the reality of faeries, which is what his dad was involved in, rather than Artemis discovering faeries and dragging Butler and Juliet into it with him like in the books. All of the characters have been drastically changed in similar manners, their traits and backstories completely thrown out the window and rewritten. They're mere caricatures of the characters they're supposed to be. Even forgetting that this was supposed to be a book adaptation the movie wasn't very good. The acting is bland and the actors are always either trying too hard or not trying hard enough. The manor is beautiful from the outside but there's far too big a disconnect between the style of the exterior and the style of the interior. The voice over narration by Josh is terrible, far too raspy and often difficult to understand due to that fact. The plot of the movie is very basic and recycled from nearly every hero or spy B movie ever made. The characters are watered down stereotypes with no depth to them at all. All in all, it's just terrible. Disney wasted so much money on a movie that turned out to be complete garbage. If you're thinking about watching \"Artemis Fowl\" my advice would be to just watch Spy Kids or Men in Black again instead. It's basically those two movies combined in the worst ways possible and somehow both of those movies are better films than this one."

If you have not read them, I would highly recommend them - they\u2019re fun for all the family.The film is... none of those things. It does have cool visual effects, some nice cinematography, a few talented actors and one good line, but it\u2019s just a messy, plodding film. It barely has any accurate translations of the first two books, and it dumbs down the plot to the pint of it - get this - not even making sense!The film opens well enough, even if it is just asking for plot holes to come, but once that troll fight happens... anything of quality is lost down the toilet. While some of the visuals are nice, some are atrocious, and the entire Fowl Mansion break in sequence was very poor. The script makes the once great characters feel hollow and thin, and a Josh Gad as Mulch Diggums... some of his scenes were painful.Overall, Artemis Fowl had the potential to be a classic adaption, but it failed due to a lazy script, a messed up story issues and an unenjoyable pace. The reviews say it for you - this is not Harry Potter 2.0."

      "text": "The worst type of book adaptation more interested in using the name as a prop rather than contributing anything meaningful. However, it should serve as a good distraction for younger audiences (although I can't imagine the level of contempt one would have for children to subject them to this generic bastardization)."

      "text": "There's a reason they released this on their crappy streaming service (thank god a friend of mine is dumb enough to pay for it) instead of in theaters.I'm a HUGE fan of the books, so let me just say this for anyone else who is as well: stay FAR, FAR AWAY!The appeal of the first few books was the character development.  The protagonist is quite the villain in the first novel, and gets better as things move along. This movie has never heard the words character development, and probably would find the concept confusing if it had.The casting sucks too.  The only halfway decent actor was Artemis' dad, who shouldn't have been in it to begin with.  I think the reviewers were afraid to badmouth Judi Dench for tribal reasons because her gravel voice and over the top performance was just as pathetic as the rest of the 'actors' in the film.  I hate agreeing with film critics, because most of them are stupid and their taste is nonexistent or based on their personal politics instead of a film's quality (See: the reviews for the newest death wish movie with bruce willis on this very site), but the one who said the best scene in the movie was the stupid fart joke was right.  Jesus."

Este es otro fracaso en la adaptaci\u00f3n al cine de libros por parte de Disney (John Carter, Un pliegue en el tiempo, El llanero solitario...) con la diferencia de que podr\u00e1n salvar un poco los muebles al poder decir que la recaudaci\u00f3n fue nula al no poderse estrenar en cines.No es posible que Disney, a estas alturas de la vida pueda permitirse productos de tan \u00ednfima calidad, en el que ni Judi Dench ni Colin Farrell son capaces de poder salir de la mediocridad.Los ni\u00f1os, como de palo, ni una sola expresi\u00f3n cre\u00edble.Si alguien se salva, a mi entender, es Josh Gad. El \u00fanico al que le veo con ganas de sacarle algo de jugo a su papel.Todo lo dem\u00e1s, de cart\u00f3n piedra. Muy falso."

I truly love the books, they were a huge part of my youth, while at the same time I understand that adapting material into a movie means some things will have to change. This adaption was different from the booki in some aspects, but it was nonetheless enjoyable. It was cute, fun, and a worthy kids movie. I only wish it had been a little longer to allow for more character development."

      "text": "Dont get yourself distracted by all those whiney toxic reviews, As a die hard artemis book fan i can say this movie is, despite beeing very imperfect, worth watching. Its MUCH closer to the Original than i thought from the trailers, and to my surprise one can find some hints that they actually read it all, like artemis and holly changing eye colours. (Even this is not book one)Generally, this movie feels like all books cramped in one, if this would have been a series it would have been a whole lot better.The effects are decent but there is, for no reason, too much cgi. cast is actually good but acting always feels wierd because there is no way to properly act on this pace. They barely have any time for caracter development and everything is just too fast to be believable.The main concerns that i still have is Artemis feeling somewhat cringey/not evil enough, and butler is somehow not characterized at all. But if you look closely that all boils down to pace, and that again to cut. The vietnam scene is missing completely despite beeing in the trailers, and thats what makes the movie feel wierd. Half an hour more of seeing artemis and butler carrying out a plan together would have made it all more believable. (Like the goddamn book)And thats sad because some script ideas are actually genius, like mulch acting reminiscent of jack sparrow and the idea that Artemis could have gotten to know Holly a lot better while he kept her jailed, as well as the subplot with her father. Yes you can shame this movie for beeing unsure who the audience is and as a \"cineast\" would barely consider it beeing good, but for a fan, it is definitly a must watch. i did not regret watching"
