      "text": "Beautiful and powerful movie. A stripped back and realistic performance from Julianne Moore, yet it has as twice as much impact as any performance i have seen in a long time. Beautifully supported by a strong cast, the most powerful scenes are with Kristen Stewart, who plays the free-spirited daughter that Alice has found the hardest to relate to due to their different career interests. Yet, it's Lydia who proves the most capable of supporting Alice in her time of need. There is really no need to go into any more detail. It's a simple story, well told.  Sad (bring tissues) yet it is an important reminder of how lucky we are to have good health and how devastating alzheimer's can be. See it!"

I was also pleased to see that for once the Academy awarded the Oscar to an actress truly deserving it.

The closest to her is Marion Cotillard in the outstanding Two Days, One Night. But Moore is entirely convincing in this daring role. The plaudits lobbed at actors who portray those with disabilities and afflictions are the subject of criticism, but this didn't strike me as that type of role. She (with the help of terrific writing and directing) really nail the human side of this terrifying illness."

      "text": "A difficult film to dislike, \"Still Alice\" has its heart and head in the right place. Julianne Moore's performance, as always, is terrific. However, on the whole, it falls flat.\r This story of a brilliant, vital women afflicted by a rare, congenital form of early onset Alzheimers fails in not fully exploring the emotion in the relationships between her and family, particularly hubby Alec Baldwin. Adding to the gap between audience and film is an excess of documentary education regarding this awful disease. All that and the redolence of Oscar bait.\r Plainly, hubby acts a moron. His motivation in the midst of his wife's swift decline is a plum new job. He literally abandons her to move to Minnesota from New York. Throughout he is neutral by maintaining a cold, clinical outlook. He speaks nary a word regarding the intellectual and emotional loss of a wife he's spent decades beside. The filmmakers, either intentionally or not, portrayed his exit as a convenient way to move on. The tears he sheds before splitting smack of relief, not grief.\r It's not only hubby foregoing real emotion. Moore's eldest, pregnant daughter reacts with an \"It's okay\" after discovering she has the gene and is doomed to a similar fate. While hysteria would push the story into unwanted melodrama, the non-reactive portrayal is similarly unwanted.\r Moore's great concern with her youngest daughter is nagging about eschewing acting for the stability of a college education. It is this daughter who volunteers to caretake Mom. An odd final scene finds the daughter reading the play \"Angels In America\" to a far gone Moore. As if trying to wring something from her she is unable to give, the daughter asks, \"What is the play about?\" to which Moore haltingly replies, \"Love.\" \"That's right. Love,\" the daughter replies. Saying 'Love' does not infuse a story with the emotion. Showing love does, and it's absent here. Those close to Moore simply look at her with a morbid curiosity reserved for strangers.\r Moore's decline is heartbreaking, particularly when a pre-planned suicide fails. It's a shame she's surrounded by matter-of-fact robots.\r Audiences should not be required to fill in blanks of emotion between Moore and others. There have been far more affecting Disease of the Week made for TV movies. Disconnecting to emphasize the least important aspects of dealing with a person afflicted by this awful disease is more tragic than this story."

The film  was directed by Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland and is based on the book by Lisa Genova who together with Messrs. Glatzer and Westomoreland wrote the screenplay. This is a difficult movie to watch yet a necessary part of the education the general public needs to get in order to understand Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and the effect it can have the victim as well as those around him or her. Ms. Moore is outstanding in this most difficult role as she and the creative cinema photographer take the viewer through the early and then almost full blown stages of the disease. It is certainly not comfortable to watch the deterioration of any individual, let alone a vibrant and once sparkling character played so admirably by Ms. Moore but intellect and curiosity compel us to stay with it.. This is more of a scholastic exercise rather than an entertainment vehicle and could well be mistaken for a promotional film displayed at a fund raiser for the Alzheimer Association. Although the film will probably not do well commercially because of the subject matter and the scenes portrayed in it, it nevertheless is a \"must see\" for anyone interested in understanding the illness and the fact that statistically so many of us will face its impact, either directly or indirectly. I give the film an 8, not only for the performances of the actors, but for the information contained in it and the sensitive manner in which it is conveyed."

She plays an accomplished linguistics professor, who is diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer\u2019s. Needless to say, with a subject like this the journey is intense and it focuses closely on Moore's slow struggle to maintain her mind and retain the relationships with her husband (Alec Baldwin) and 3 children. The supporting cast is strong and the directing duo has fashioned a sensitive story. It does occasionally feel the need to provide us factual information about the disease, but mainly stays on course with many downer moments and lots of tears. This is not a great film, but it is a great performance."

As the story goes by we see the protagonist facing the different steps of an illness: first denial about the possibility and desperation to uncertainly, second fall apart at knowing the diagnosis and third, acceptance and surrender to the disease. Then we have the family,  with each one of family members we notice distinct ways to cope. The changing of expectations on what she can or can't do, moving on with one's life, stepping aside and staying for the time remaining. Either way it's possible to empathize with this scenario. Julianne Moore gives a brutally realistic performance, reaching unimaginable levels of depression, with a climax at the scene of the speech. The problem is the passiveness in which the story is told, making it very hard to follow, really an exhausting movie (but hey, that's life with a sick relative)."

She and her equally successful husband, John (Alec Baldwin) live in a brownstone in which they have raised their three children, now on their own paths, and have a summer home on the shore. In everyway she is successful as a professional, a mother and a wife.\r Very early in the film Alice, at the age of fifty, is diagnosed with early on set Alzheimer\u2019s which it turns out is genetic and there is a 50 percent chance of their children contacting it and, after testing, one of the children tests positive. The screenwriters/directors Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland dismiss this angle in the movie instead concentrating on Alice and Moore comes through with a devastating performance. By the end of the film you will know what it means to have Alzheimer\u2019s, what and how it takes everything from you. Wordlessly, with a look, the changes in her face, the awareness of what she will lose before she loses it, is upsetting because we know what she had and she no longer does.\r The film rightfully concentrates on Moore but the screenwriters don\u2019t help her in not filling out the roles of her husband and children. We know her husband loves her because he tells her but Baldwin is a good enough actor to show us with little touches here and there. Her children, played by Kristen Stewart, Kate Bosworth and Hunter Parrish, are normal, well adjusted children which at times can drive a parent crazy and there is one scene where Moore uses that old line, \u201c\u2026.I can because I am your mother,\u201d that has the audience laughing. The conflict between a mother and daughter is briefly touched on just as the sibling rivalry between sisters is but neither are fleshed out.\r The film is not all sadness and tears, with little bits of humor here and there, but we share the few triumphs Alice has along the way just as in two scenes we are afraid to breathe.\r For those who haven\u2019t dealt with Alzheimer\u2019s in their family this is a learning experience of what has happened with 45 million people in the world going through this debilitating disease and what their loved ones have to deal with.\r Julianne Moore has deservedly earned 4 Oscar nominations along the way and with her 5th in \u201cStill Alice\u201d she is deserving of getting that statue that has eluded her."

Her rapid deterioration is utterly believable and the screenplay manages to avoid the obvious clich\u00e9s that this kind of movie can be prone to.\rAs her daughter, Lydia, Kristen Stewart does a great job of holding her own when on screen with Moore. The film successfully paints the picture of a fractious relationship between mother and daughter which only begins to repair due to the unforeseen and tragic circumstances.

Julianne Moore performance as Dr. Alice Howland is exceptionally wonderful. Her performance in the shoes of 'Alice' proves that she is a prefect match for Academy Award 'Best Actress'. A 100 minute drama is based on a linguistic professor 'Dr. Alice Howland' who develops an early onset of Alzheimer's disease and starts forgetting the words, places, incidents and also people. She has a beautiful family with a troublesome youngest daughter Lydia played by Kristen Stewart. This 100 minute journey shows the decline of Alice from a brilliant lexicon to a dreadful Alzheimer patient. For the first 80 minutes, it is a terrifying portrayal of Alice where one gets doubt on oneself that he/she is having Alzheimer's disease, but the last 20 minutes is long heinous drama in the family for which one can simply walk out of theater.The appreciative thing in the movie is Julianne's performance and also the technical team who were behind this movie. Some extraordinary locations like the beach, campus of Columbia University are well pictured and also awfully directed. It is a one time watch but if you like  Julianne's performance you can have it for more than 10 times. Its just 'Julianne', 'Julianne' and 'Julianne'."

Still it's gloomy and I began to like Julianne Moore even more here.\rThe best scenes for me was when Alice looks for a toilet but forgot where it is so she pees in her pants and got hysterical and when she got lost in her own campus. So depressing."

      "text": "yeah, it was about love..Still AliceThere are some tracks that they could have easily chosen to thicken the plot or add some twists and enter the dark zone but they keep it light here for the most part of it and sums it up to 'hope' in the end. Still Alice is a feature that doesn't come often, it offers everything expected and some more in addition to a heart in the centre of it pumping all the way through in each and every frame of it keeping it alive and soothing over its short runtime of around 100 minutes. The writer-director duo Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland are magnificent and dedicated to the last word of their work which is visible completely onto the screen. But in the end, it's all in Julianne Moore's side of the show and boy what a show she has to offer, she is flat out brilliant and heartwarming along with a great supporting cast like Kirsten Stewart and Alec Baldwin. Still Alice has fast pace natured script, intriguing and gripping screenplay, majestic performances and an immortal soul in it."

Sin duda, Julianne Moore tuvo un papel muy bueno al saber interpretar a una persona con esta enfermedad, sus gestos y sus acciones lo dec\u00edan todo."
