It also could be because Robert Rodriguez is one from few directors interested in camera movements and shots. Or because the music from the movie is good (the offspring, class of 99). Anyway, i feel good when i see this movie. Thanks Mr. Rodr\u00edguez"

      "text": "A brilliant mix of science fiction and teen horror. This is without a doubt one of the best sci-fi films of the last decade. In a recent trip to the U.S. I had the pleasure of viewing this film(seven times) and loved every minute of it. It is a perfect example of both Kevin Williamson's and Robert Rodriguez's talent. It has a silly-sounding story, aliens taking over a school disguised as teachers, but you don't think about that as you are blown away by brilliant special effects, fast-paced action, smart-worded script and brilliant acting from both the teachers and the students. There is also the sexy Famke Janssen, Jordana Brewster and Laura Harris, and for the girls there's Josh Hartnett(I suppose). As for who the queen alien is, it will be easy for some people to guess, but surprising for others. For those who don't like horror there's the science fiction factor, including a brilliant shot of the alien in the school gym at the end. And for those who don't like science fiction, there's quite a lot of horror(or horrible scenes) like fingers running around on their own, a head crawling around on octopus-like legs, while its body searches for it in the background, and teacher being stabbed in the eye with drugs that affect it, it then begins to splurt white stuff, similar to that of the androids blood in ALIENS But it does take a teens perspective and is aimed at a younger audience(although not that young) and is so not that gory. So there's something for everybody, you should go and see it as soon as you can."

With a cast that can't be beat, including my favorite actress of them all, Famke Janssen, and a script that holds together despite its far-out premise, this movie has all the makings of a repeat viewing attraction. Most of the young cast, Josh Hartnett, Jordana Brewster, Clea Duvall, have gone on to great careers, and it started here. Add in veterans like Robert Patrick, Bebe Neuwerth, Salma Hayek, and my all  favorite actress Famke Janssen, and it all clicks. The movie has enough thrills and chills to keep most horror fans engaged, and enough of a sci-fi premise to have the nerds drooling. Plus some partial nudity and a lot of sex talk adds a lot. I always enjoy this flick, seeing as was on on TV frequently. It never gets old, kind of like The One and Drop Dead Gorgeous. As for it being a sell-out, it was Rodriguez's first major studio flick, and had the master of sell-out Kevin Williamson writing it."

      "text": "The Faculty delivers exactly what you expect from a highschool-comedy-horror. It has all the usual character archetypes played by soon-to-be megastars: the oppressed nerd (Elijah Wood), the whip-smart rebel (Josh Hartnett), the goth outcast (Clea DuVall), the misunderstood jock (Shawn Hatosy), miss perfect super-b*tch (Jordana Brewster) and the new girl (Laura Harris). Kevin Williamson's writing is sharp, funny and self-aware as always, and knowingly refers to the numerous earlier films The Faculty pays homage to. The film is consistently fun, with the best scene being the students driven to playing a rather unconventional version of Russian roulette through intense paranoia of possession by the film's parasitic invaders. The final act of the film does disappoint a little - its big, loud and unnecessary, and showcases the film's unfortunate lack of a decent budget. Though it doesn't have any glaring weaknesses other than this segment, The Faculty does still feel like it's lacking something. Perhaps its the fact that it would be fairly unremarkable teen schlock were it not for Williamson's contribution, or maybe its that Robert Rodriguez is allowed very little opportunity to inject his zany creative style into the film, and consequently it feels like it was helmed by any old mercenary director-for-hire. Even so, The Faculty is pretty consistently entertaining, with good performances across the board, a pleasing amount of laughs and horror and sci-fi movie references aplenty for the buffs in the audience."

      "text": "Robert Rodriguez follows up his other B-movie (From Dusk Till Dawn) with another B-movie The Faculty, which screams for a cult following. Robert Rodriguez seems to like settling for mediocrity.  The writer Kevin Williamson tries to keep the steam rolling from his work on the first two Scream movies, but is running on fumes. After all that being said I enjoyed the movie for what it is."

      "text": "\"Why are you naked?\" - Zeke\r Because what sexist film would be complete with a completely naked girl being the source of all of this mayhem and chaos at this school? How could a woman not be to blame for all that has occurred in The Faculty? It is really only the natural progression for a film that asks us to identify with Casey (Elijah Wood). A dorky kid who is constantly bullied, Casey is the classic underdog hero in film and despite obvious character flaws such as sniffing Delilah (Jordana Brewster) while hiding in the closet and despite creepily having a shrine dedicated to Delilah (okay, Jordana Brewster is attractive, but Jesus that is not anywhere near a free pass for being a 100% creep). I am not one to sit here and criticize how sexist a film is, but I feel is truly that obvious in The Faculty, which is a shame.\r With sexism as its main argument against, The Faculty comes armed to the teeth to appeal to kids who were marginalized (read: boys who were not popular in high school) by having Casey be bullied, pine after the hottest girl in school, have parents who cannot give two **** about him, not be athletic, and be a complete loner not just save the school, but also manage to scoop up the girl of his dreams in the process. Written like a wet dream, The Faculty is a creepy film that continues to dehumanize women in its treatment of women throughout. Not just Delilah and Marybeth are marginalized, but girls are all frequently called **** and shown to be quite **** and aggressive **** You Girl\" and Ms. Burke, in particular). Additionally, when Professor Furlong (surprise appearance from Jon Stewart) hits on Nurse Harper (another shock appearance from Salma Hayek) in a creepy manner, we are left to sympathize with him because how could anybody ever turn down such  Oh and, lest we forget, the demonization of the unseen wife of Mr. Tate (Daniel van Bargen). In spite of his alcoholism, somehow she is the evil one for leaving him for somebody else. God forbid.\r Other than latent and prevalent sexism, The Faculty is faulty in many other ways as well, if you are left unswayed. I can deal with a wildly unoriginal film, but this one is truly revolutionary in this regard. References to prior science fiction films does not get you off the hook for ripping them at every chance you get. It honestly felt as though ever line mentioned a different film and how it is possible that the events of this one were going to follow the same line. I love the Amazon Prime X-Ray feature, which shows you goofs, trivia, continuity errors, cast on screen, and other little tidbits about a film while you are watching it. For The Faculty, I was floored. Practically every shot had some tidbit about how it referenced a film. Some shots had multiple films. Truly impressive level of copying. I get the sense that if Robert Rodriguez had to use Turnitin for this film, it would come up with 0% originality.\r Now, there are a few positives. In spite of these concerns, it is quite a fun film. I was certainly entertained by the film and I am sure many who can overlook my aforementioned problems will enjoy The Faculty. Rodriguez's films certainly always have flair to them and this one is no exception. A fast paced thrill ride, The Faculty may be unoriginal, but it does ape many of the better qualities of past films and is filled with camaraderie, high school hijinx/personalities, thrills, and teenage angst classic rock hits that many would request of a science fiction/horror film set in a high school. These overtures on the part of the film are, admittedly, hard to resist. It hits all the right notes with its plot and the return is pure enjoyment.\r Additionally, Rodriguez has great attention to detail that clues you into characters or are simply quality jokes. From Zeke (Josh Hartnett) having \"USA Sucks Big Time\" in his locker to a car supporting the Herrington High School Hornets having \"Me So Hornet' written on it, there are some subtle jokes along the way. The film also showcases attention to detail in delivering thrills by having a banner hanging in the gym the reads \"Feel the sting\" as the monster corners Casey. These details were not lost on me as a viewer and were among the reasons why I was so disheartened that it opted to be so unoriginal and sexist in its plot and characterization, respectively.\r A fun and detailed film from director Robert Rodriguez, The Faculty has a solid cast filled with recognizable faces, plus Josh Hartnett with significant bedhead. That said, despite its boyish charms, the film is overtly sexist and as unoriginal as they come, thanks to familiar plotting, characters, and references. The film often feels as if Robert Rodriguez had just caught up with all of John Hughes' 1980s teen comedies, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Thing, all films by Steven Spielberg, and all of Stephen King's books before opting to just smash them into one film."

The story is rather average for Sci Fi, there are some stupidities along the plot. The visual effects are not so good even for 1998. But still it's pretty nice to check it out if you haven't!"

Instead of relying on the usual hack n slash tactics that many horror film makers have come to rely on, this film sneaks in a sci-fi undertone to add suspense. The cast of characters is diverse and wonderfully acted. Sure there are a few stock roles but the actors and actresses who fill them do a great job at putting themselves in the roles. It's a shame that this movie didn't gain the same cult following that other teen dramas such as Donnie Darko obtained but all the same, it is a thrilling film."

The plot is good but it transposes the typical \"Breakfast Club\" high school strata(the jock, the nerd, the druggie, the loner, ms. popular)typical 80's characterizations. But none the less a good plot. The actual action scenes were cool and the plot was fluidly flowing and the cast was excellent. A DEFINITE MUST SEE IF YOU LIKE PREVIOUS WILLIAMSON FLICKS."
