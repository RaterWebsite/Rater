But what Walter lacks in social skills he makes up for in smarts and invention, creating the awesome gadgets Lance uses on his epic missions.

Both Will Smith and Tom Holland did amazing jobs! Japanese characters of Kimura and Yakuza are villains. They speak native Japanese. Probably, Japanese voice actors did.This is a funny movie!"

The story is very creative and does not fall into modern narrative cliches.  I genuinely laughed out loud a few times.  This is the perfect holiday movie for the whole family that is also creatively satisfying."

Genuinely funny with a unique animation style, the movie provides a fresh and unique take on the classic spy/sidekick adventure, keeping the viewer engaged from start to end."

Armed by witty script that mixes action and humor, free of gross jokes, and Will Smith and Tom Holland in the voice cast, you get 103 minutes plenty of amusement that deserves a combo of popcorn, soda and chocolate bar (just like me, in my birthday)."

      "text": "This or Frozen II? This or Frozen II?.... Whatever, both movies had mindforks during the end credits.To say that Spies In Disguise reeks of \"I've watched this film before\" may be just enough to make you think of the kind of movie you'll be watching. But to say this was the best Will Smith performance of 2019 (between this, Aladdin 2019 and Gemini Man) was enough to give it a passing grade.And when I mean \"I've watched this before\", I mean it. From the first second, you already know where it'll be going, even if there's still a bone in its body to make it stand out amongst other Animated Movies this year, thanks to the whole \"Spy gets turned into a Pigeon\" concept, which almost reaches its full potential once the \"buddy cop\" part of the movie goes on.It's from there that the movie goes full-throttle, being busy just to make sure you're having a wild ride, between Action Sequences that feel like that's where the $110 Million budget mostly went to, a score that wants to be 007 but also wants to be emotive because Animated Movie.The cast perfectly plays off of each other (obviously Ben Mendelsohn as the villain was Awesome as always) and the humor is hit or miss. Yes, even with a 50 Shades joke that I let it slide just fine, especially considering how Universal will soon destroy the magic of LEGO in theaters. And there's a nice message for kids too. Go weird and go wild, even if you're from somewhere else.It could've been all great had it not been a \"seen it, done it\" situation. A big example of how familiar it is can be The LEGO Batman Movie. And, for being an Animated Movie, it sure doesn't have a look of its own. Sure, they play off \"the characters need to look like the actors playing them\" expertly, but other than that, it's your standard run-of-the-mill Animation, backgrounds and everything.It also helps that I had a mindfork during the credits, since, apparently, Andrew Stanton (a Pixar veteran) and Meg LeFauve (writer of Inside Out) were credited as Consultants for the movie. Again, hard to decide if Frozen II was the better mindfork or this one.Regardless, this is still an entertaining romp with a great duo, and iit easily features the best secondary character (besides Tom Holland) in an Animated Movie this year (ironically played by DJ Khaled). Like yeah, it's familiar and all, but it's better than Star Wars, that's something."

The animation and character designs were outstanding especially the designs of the pigeons, Lance Sterling, Walter Beckett, Joy Jenkins, Killian, and Katsu Kimura. The voice acting from Will Smith, Tom Holland, Reba McEntire, Masi Oka, DJ Khaled, Rashida Jones, Karen Gillan, and Ben Mendelsohn was phenomenal. The writing was stupendous and really funny. This was overall a great movie."

Sure, sometimes it fell flat (I mean, there's a 50 Shades of Grey joke) but most of the time I liked the humor. The leads develop a fun dynamic and the performances of their voice actors were pretty solid. It doesn't really want to be taken seriously (and when it tried, it was extremely cheesy) and that's fine. It isn't bad but it wasn't like a great movie or anything, it was fine, if you want to watch it just go ahead."

It\u2019s clever, funny, not cheesy, even though there\u2019s still a few childish moments and all-out fun. I mean, James Bond meets pigeons and animation? Come on. It\u2019s a weird concept in itself but does such a great job of making it interesting and amusing. The only complaint would be the underused villain, Killian, actually. I did appreciate that the filmmakers went with a more \u201cvillain in the shadows\u201d concept, but it may have worked out better if there was more screen time for Ben Mendelsohn\u2019s character. Overall, it\u2019s visually charming, headed by a great cast, with quirky and fun aspects in a very digestible format of animation."

Movies 'Spies in Disguise' gives us a good explanation for Disney and Pixar continuing to dominate film animation. It pushes absurdity while at the same time throwing heavy-handed, disorganized and overly-sentimental messages of pacifism. I've gotten to the point where animation has lost a lot of its charm and appeal, and films like 'Spies in Disguise' are the reason why."

      "text": "In the beginning Walter's mom dies. They don't tell us how, why nor did they show character development between Walther & his mom. Walters moms death is a motivation to Walther & is referenced by other characters in the movie. But, to us as the watchers; when its brought up we don't care due to lack of character development. In the film its said that Walther graduated MIT when he was 15. So, how did Walther become so smart? What motivated him to build things as a kid(even before his moms death)? How was he so advanced at building & generally being smart at such a young age? This is also unanswered by this film.That's just me being picky but, there is other big faults in this movie. Like for one: Why is Lance so respected like, how did he build his status? Why is he so good at being a spy; seems like he's the only spy there who gets gadgets made for them specially & the only one who goes on solo covert ops. Also, What keeps him motivated as a spy besides the generic \"I like saving people\". Cause it seems like he rather has no family or doesn't care about his family. Lance only cares about the agency so, there must be something motivating him to care for it so much. What kind of connections does Lance have to Killian(Main villian of this film).Lance said \"I'm sorry what happened in Krpytistan\"(I forgot how to spell it but, the film doesn't care so why should I) this meaning he was involved but, they don't tell us nor show us anything. Like, why was Lance & the agency over there? What did the agency do while they were there? How did & what did they do to Killian's friends that was so gruesome? Why was Killian so close to his partners? Guess we have to imagine. This is the biggest thing that was glanced over. Killian motives are because his partners died but, I'm not going to be sad because they didn't show any character devolvement between Killian & his buddies. This film is good for the family, very casual watchers, people who just want something to put them in a good mode. This film can be fun, it just has some pretty big faults. I was going to give this film a 5/10 but, since it has some fair jokes, tried something unique & wasn't a 100% bore fest. I think 6/10 is good enough for this film."

It would establish Lances personality and, with some bonding moments between villain and his friends, meaning of that killing to villain that is called Killian, i think. It would make movie much better. Original ideas would make movie better, too. Good things are animation and action. Will Smith is making this movie better. Message is really dumb and UNORIGINAL!!!
