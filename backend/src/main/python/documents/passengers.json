There is nothing morereal in  life more  than death  I Apreciated the movie secuence  and the great end.,  I do not know why people rated low this movie, for me this movie was phenomenal. I imagine people are getting less sensitive in this century or people are forgetting to life free of materialism, violence and hatret.  This movie is the oposite; true  and pure love, respect to those gone and a good reason to clearly understand life."

      "text": "If you are looking for an intense-shocking thriller with a great twist in the end this movie is not your thing. Not that it's an awful film but it's not as good as you expect. The main story is really good and original and it seems really interesting, Anne Hathaway was good too but that's all in that movie. Everything else is just one hour and a half of stupidity and boredom. It has no atmosphere and even the music reminded me of a romantic comedy. Too bad.. It could have been much much better."

      "text": "I am a huge Anne Hathaway fan but I have to say that this is probably one of her worse movies.  It's not bad through any fault of her own, the acting by everybody in the movie is solid.  This is just horrible writing.   It's incredibly predictable. My wife actually guessed this within the first ten minutes.  I enjoyed watching the ending but the journey to get there was just not worth it.  Also, Anne Hathaway's character is supposed to by a therapist which makes 90% of this movie frustrating in how un-professional she is.  Overall I was very disappointed and wont be watching it again.  If you catch it on TV you might enjoy it otherwise it's not really worth watching."

M\u00eame l'estim\u00e9 Patrick Wilson a l'air paum\u00e9 ici de toute fa\u00e7on, dans cet ersatz de film... 100\u00a8% pourri, tout \u00e0 jeter... pas recyclable !"

I don't get how it got such bad reviews....I thoroughly enjoyed. it..guess nowadays all anyone looks for in the movies are gor and nudity. This had none of those, but I had to watch it again, to realize ...well, I won't give that away...seriously watch it!"
