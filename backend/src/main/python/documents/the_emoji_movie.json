Why does this movie need to exist? The idea wasn't even well executed. It's chock full of cliches and moments that are hard to watch.

The Emoji Movie asks for your money so bad they had to literally do the impossible. New low for the year and possibly for the rest of this decade if there aren't as many cringeworthy movies in the near future. The crew behind this embarrassment that you call a movie will probably regret working on this a few years later when it comes to that time. If you give this movie your money, you should feel ashamed of yourself."

The film is terrible, bland, short, and boring, just like ourselves. Never would I have thought that a movie would make me reflect on my incredibly useless life, but The Emoji Movie did. The Emoji Movie shows us that we're all just trapped in our own world, we're useless, and we should only have one sole purpose. The film is too good for all our puny human brains to process, and it even made Kim Jong Un cry. If you don't like the film, it is because you don't understand the sheer beauty and perfection that the film delivers. Go clean up your dirty minds and keep watching it until you understand it. This film is an international treasure and should be shown to everyone."

I am not even kidding, the plot, if you can call it that is interrupted constantly for adverts for products such as Drop Box, Twitter, YouTube and even the Just Dance game.  I am not even joking, for no reason, the plot is interrupted for an advert for a mobile version of Just Dance.  Everyone in this movie is terrible, they are all giving awful performances, including smug performances from Anna Faris, T J Miller, especially James Corden, who seems to be in every terrible animated film I am watching at the minute, playing the exact same role every time and in this film, he is incredibly annoying.  The jokes are never funny, the animation is obnoxious and there is no real message to it whatsoever.  Kind of ironic considering it\u2019s a movie about emoji\u2019s.  This is one of the most cynical things I have ever seen aimed at children and the fact that this film is aimed at children is the most disgusting part of it.  The film also has no original idea whatsoever, ripping off other more successful family films constantly, especially Inside Out, Wreck it Ralph and Toy Story, doing it in a way that required no effort at all.  You will want to slap some dignity into Patrick Stewart for playing the pooper emoji and I would like to point out the opening credits say Sir Patrick Stewart, Robbie Collins summed it up better in saying the opening credits might as well have said \u201cyes, we have ruined this man\u2019s career\u201d.  Everything about it is everything I despise about cinema:  no effort, product based placement throughout the Wazoo, no originality, mugging actors constantly giving off the impression that they know what they are in is terrible but they don\u2019t care as they got an easy pay check and an attitude of \u201cthat\u2019s good enough for them\u201d, which cinema should never have!!  Before you say anything, the opposite is just as bad, I hate films that go \u201cif you don\u2019t get it you are obviously an idiot\u201d.  So don\u2019t accuse me of being elitist for my opinions on this film.  It\u2019s just crap and anything in the comments section for this review that have any emoji\u2019s in are getting deleted instantly.  I am sick of them now and if I ever see a copy of this film, I am going to set it on fire.  I HATED THIS MOVIE!!!"

      "text": "\"The Emoji Movie\" is maybe one of the most perplexing pieces of media I have ever borne witness to. I feel strange saying this, but this movie was written... incorrectly. I have never before felt this way about a film, but this movie was written wrong. The worst part isn't even the fact that the main characters are representations of things as characterless as a coat rack, it's the fact that the film doesn't know what it wants to be. This movie has a bizarre tendency of making overly cynical jokes, yet presenting them in such a way that children are guaranteed to take the wrong message. For example, the phrase \"Words are lame, use an emoji\" are presented at a certain point to the user of the phone where the eponymous emojis reside, yet this phrase is not balanced in any way by a differing perspective, a sarcastic glance, or any similar method of showing that it was a joke. This happens multiple times throughout the film. It is also worth noting that pretty much every line spoken by the \"Jailbreak\" character seems to be there just so they can consolidate the female gender into a marketing tactic like they did with \"Ghostbusters\". Thankfully, it doesn't work at all, and just makes a few scenes a lot more awkward than they would have been normally. I recall actually pausing the movie when she said the line \"You know men are always taking credit for things that women come up with\" after the main character figured out what her reasoning was and confirmed that he knew what she was talking about, not at all taking any credit for what she was saying.In terms of the rest of the movie, I feel bad for anyone who paid to sit through 2 hours of advertisements for dropbox. I almost didn't expect it to be as bad as it is. For a film which prominently shows spam emails as a recurring joke, it sure does present a lot of its own spam. Another pause moment happened when the main characters escaped from a villain by going into dropbox, to which the girl replied \"It's illegal malware, and this app is secure!\". I believe I could feel my brain slowly melting out of my ears when that statement was made.While I didn't enjoy this movie, it is kind of a shame that it had to be this way. A lot of people probably didn't like this movie solely because it was essentially a drawn-out advertisement for smartphone downloads. The problem is, there is another movie that is essentially one big advertisement for products, yet it's one of the best animated films I've ever seen! If the people making \"The Emoji Movie\" had taken any inspiration from \"The Lego Movie\", we could have had a potentially amazing film! It is especially depressing since the animation in this film is as good as it could be, being wonderfully stylized and moving beautifully. All in all, \"The Emoji Movie\" is maybe one of the most depressing pieces of cinema I've ever seen. In terms of recommendations, if you are a person who likes to tear films apart, I would recommend watching this film once and never again. To everyone else, avoid this film like the black plague. It's bad for you and terrible for your kids."

The Emoji Movie was exactly what I thought it would be from when I saw the trailer, an incredibly ridiculous abomination that filled me with anger. It doesn't deserve any praise at all, it lacks what I think every film should have: a soul. The animation of the Emoji Movie may be decent enough, but that won't win me over.

Not even Gene himself on the cover can keep a smile on himself. It's boring to the extreme, the jokes aren't funny, and this entire film's existence is something nobody would ask for. Don't even get me started on how much this film seems like a mash up commercial! In conclusion, don't even think about watching this film, unless if you want to see how bad it really is, and to lower the rating of this movie even more, which in that case, I'd be fine with."

Not even when it's just his voice trying to carry the show. The whole cast sounds so generic I was genuinely shocked to find out that it wasn't comprised solely of D-listers. What was Patrick Stewart thinking?!It starts off simple enough. A boring Wreck-It-Ralph rip-off that really has nothing going on. It's kind of smug in a \"haha, look at me! I'm poking fun at how teenagers keep their heads buried in their phones!\" sort of way. Self-satisfied with the fact that it even exists in the first place. It's bad, but not torture. Not then. But oh boy does it take a turn. It happens about the time Candy Crush shows up. That's right ladies and gentlemen, there's a lot of app-related product placement. Watching the little emojis play Candy Crush is just as fun as watching a real life person play Candy Crush. Not fun at all. But it doesn't stop there. We get to watch the little tumors play with other apps as well. Oh boy!It's got more than just phone games though. We'll witness these poor excuses for characters visit Dropbox, YouTube, Spotify, and a few others. Now, this could have been a cute thing, but the implementation isn't clever or inventive. Nothing in The Emoji Movie is. The stale quest about being true to who you are is not only devoid of originality, but heart as well. Every emoji and phone creature thingy is a bland stereotype meant to carry the almost non-existent plot forward. Things get weird when it tries to preach feminism and has weird symbolism on things like divorce. It never manages to actually say anything about them, but you can tell they're there. Because, you know, I'm sure that didn't go over the heads of the 6 year olds in the audience out there. The ones that were scarred for life by their first truly abysmal movie.What tiny bit of imagination it does have is only present on the surface level and is meant to cover up a rotten core created by a group of morally bankrupt individuals that created this film to exploit children in order to prey on the wallets of their unsuspecting parents who didn't know any better. The Emoji Movie is a humorless romp through cellphone land that is devoid of joy and personality. Don't watch it and certainly don't let it near your kids. That would be child abuse in my book. I'm sure there are judges who would agree."
