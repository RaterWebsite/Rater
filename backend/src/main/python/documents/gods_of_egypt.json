Egypt is in Africa. That does not mean that everyone one in Africa has dark skin. Is that really how far people have fallen. Right away, we stereotype all African's as black. How absurdly incorrect.

The story was put into place, and you can find a excellent villain in Butler. The acting was light, but not without it's darker moments.

This movie is action packed, and the story is pretty solid. I'm going to have to give it a 6 or 7 out of 10, because it was clearly above 5, which is what I consider to be average.

I think the Hollywood fed up with Greek stuffs, now they're looking at the ancient Egypt. Where's the next stop? India? This film was not a bad idea. I liked the story, a mission based concept, but I did not like the CGI. Visually, it was okay, though those CGI characters felt like they're from sci-fi. I think they inspired by the ancient Egyptian arts. Other than that, this film is enjoyable.\r At least I knew about Greek deities, I learnt a few words and names about Egypt mythology through this. Gerard Butler in a negative shade was good and the other actors too decent. I was not interested in this film, but now somewhat I enjoyed it, that mean they should stop it here, no sequel please.\r I had no issue with the casting, it is a marketing strategy. You can't just put a new foreign face in front of the camera and make money out of it. Cinema itself means fake display. Age, skin, death, everything is fake. So people must learn to accept it similar to when a black, Malaysian or Indonesian man says he's a mooslim, but genetically he's not, just converted to.\r Well composed stunt sequences, especially bloods with liquid gold, totally got the PG13. Least expected film of the year, but got entertained better. It got the mixed response and mostly negative feedback from the critics, but who knows you might have a good time like I did. So you could try it if you want in your free time, because it is not worth to spend your valuable time.\r 6/10"}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Not sure where to start with this movie.. though a great cast but in an entirely wrong movie.

I rented it from the library so there was absolutely no cost for me other than time spent watching the movie. I have to say it wasn't terrible. The CGI effects are outdated, but other than that it was ok. Gerard Butler and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau both do excellent jobs. Brenton Thwaites is utterly forgettable as Bek. Everyone else does a fine job as secondary background characters.\r The movie is entertaining rather than a work of art. I enjoyed this much more than I did Suicide Squad, Batman vs. Superman, or heck even Civil War. I think the movie took an inordinate amount of flak because the lead characters were white and there were cries of \"white washing.\" For the record 1) classical Egyptians (or modern ones for that matter) were never black. 2) Egypt was conquered by Alexander the Great so a large chunk of Egyptian rulers (e.g. Cleopatra) were actually of Greek decent (i.e. white).

It's just a bunch of glowing CGI nonsense slopped all over the screen while actors, both with and without talent, wander around.

Although the movie is certainly not a classic, it isn't as bad as the reviews indicate.  I was never bored and I thought the special effects fit the tone of the film.  All the actors seemed to be into the movie, especially Gerard Butler and Brenton Thwaites.  I also enjoyed Geoffrey Rush as \"Ra\" the sun God.  I felt that the movie was trying to capture the spirit of some of the old classics like \"Clash of the Titans\", and for me it succeeded on that level."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I found the movie very entertaining and don't really understand why it gets so many bad reviews. It's a fun mix of mythology, action and fantasy. Some great visuals and epic scenes, one of my favourites beeing Ra's fight upon the sun barque against the god of darkness and chaos Apophis! I could imagine that the CGI could maybe look a bit unrealistic or cheesy on a normal screen, but seeing it in 3D on the big screen it actually looked rather convincing and cool. And it's not easy to display gods and their epic fights in a way that does them justice without getting too over the top. Gerard Butler is allways fun to watch, and the others are doing ok. Some lines are cheesy, but overall the characters are likeable. Script and story are ok too. I liked the way they portraied the gods. Wielding terrible power, but not almighty, and rather human like in character. More entertaining and closer to the mythological source material than other movies like Clash of the Titans, or Thor. And yes they cast white actors (among others) to play egyptian gods which is not ideal, but understandable. If europeans can deal with a black Heimdal in Thor (you know, the god that is literally called \"the whitest of the Aesir\" and \"the white As\" in the source mythology), egyptians should be able to handle a white Horus. Hey at least Toth was black and Anubis was a Jackal. What more do you want? ;)"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "When I first watched this, i kept on thinking about all the negative critiques it got.

Did I missing something? Did the director shoot a panda in real life of something? Honestly, the movie was fun to watch. Over the top? Crazy? Elaborate? Sure.

The effects are very good most of the time, while unfortunately falling short during some scenes. The story is fine for an epic popcorn style movie, yet again, a few scenes show through where the acting falls short. If you look past these shortcomings and come in with a positive attitude and don't expect anything intellectually groundbreaking - this movie is totally fine. It's probably the best Egyptian themed movie you're going to see for a new few years. Ignore the critics and just watch it for yourself."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I don't see why there's so much hate for this movie. It was clearly meant to be little more than a green-screen action spectacle, but this one leans heavily on its mythological elements, which some will enjoy more than others. The action ranges from so-so (obviously green-screen pyramid fight scene) to cool (magical babes riding giant flame-throwing cobras) to incredible (anything with Ra and the hell monster).\r I'm guessing that a lot of the negativity is a result of the writing. It's true, the dialogue is lacking and there are several cheesy lines, but the benefit of the fast-paced script is that it conveys the solid world-building clearly. The story moves at a good pace, and the characters are likable and act in ways that make sense. None of the main characters do anything stupid, and the villain doesn't make dumb decisions. So that's already an improvement over most films of this genre.\r I want to believe in this world and I would like to see sequels with these characters but unfortunately due to this film having an estimated disappointing performance, that doesn't seem to be likely.\r The only things worth complaining about are a lack of a memorable script and the very green-screen look, which is a result of everything being shot and lit a little too perfectly and being comped into backgrounds that can resemble a very well-rendered PS4 game. I am a big fan of director Alex Proyas' \"The Crow\" and \"Dark City\". This is not his best work but I definitely think it's being overly thrashed. If you enjoyed \"Prince of Persia\" and \"Clash of the Titans\", you'll probably enjoy this, too."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I never write reviews on metacritic.

This is just meant to be a fun, action-packed visual thrill ride against the backdrop of a mythical Egypt.  The visual effects were imaginative and spectacular.  The action scenes are paced well.\r This movies main weakness is character development.  The main character seems like a super-human homeless person, which doesn't make much sense.  Of course, it's hard to feel for the Gods, because, well, they're Gods with precious few flaws to make them relate-able.\r If you just want to turn your brain off and see action, near death escapes, and creative visual effects, this is the movie for you."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "This movie is terrible, it really is!

People who give this a score lower than a 6 can absolutely be disregarded as bias and comparing it to a movie that they think it should be.

I didn't know the Gods were bigger than humans; had to do \"Lord of the Rings\" film tricks to make that happen.

The film did provide a spectacle, however, with a number of interesting characters and interesting moments throughout. The plot makes little sense and the whitewashing element so heavily discussed is greatly prominent within the film, and many parts of the film come off a cheesy or unattempted humor.

It's an overblown, fantasy CGI-fest. Admittedly though it's better than the rest of it's ilk.

That's something that ultimately works in it's favor. The amount of crazy crap going on keeps things moving even when the movie is focusing on overly familiar themes of revenge, redemption, and love. The cast itself is great. For whatever reason though, the director (Alex Proyas) has Brenton Thwaites acting way too calm in the face of danger. To the point where it doesn't make any sense. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau of Game of Thrones fame is the highlight. I've never been a big Gerard Butler fan, but he was really good as the villain.\r There is a lot of CGI used here. The emphasis on the movie seems to be big spectacle. There's a problem with that. This isn't the best CGI. It's not terrible and things can look really good at times. However there are other times where things look way too fake and you can tell they are just standing in front of a green screen. The movie just isn't pretty enough to really sell everything.\r It's some nice doses of humor, action, and craziness. The plot is familiar and the romance clich\u00e9, but the cast is entirely onboard. It's a little too over-the-top and out there and the special effects just aren't that special. It's the type of movie where you're either onboard or your not. However even if you are up for it, it's hard to deny there's plenty of more satisfying entertainment out there.
