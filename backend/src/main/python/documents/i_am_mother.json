From Utilitarianism to touches of well placed Ethical egoism (not particularly of the Rand-ist variety) this movie asks very real questions of the humans alive today and potentially those of the future.

That is because the machine is superbly animated with great practical effects mixed with CGI and voiced by a great VA. GLaDOS would better watch out if this was a series.Both actresses were superbly cast and acted superbly, which was augmented by an excellent soundtrack and atmosphere, both within the facility and outside.The story follows the expected point of the genre, but manages to subvert them creatively while I felt the movie played satisfactorily with my expectations.If one small thing could be added, is that I thought that Mother's internal motivations and wishes could afford to be explored deeper. As evidenced by the machine wanting to touch the baby one last time by the end, it did have a form of what we call feelings. I would've liked to see, in some way, in what way did the second child fail and how did Mother express that to the child, as the movie has indicated that Mother saw  Daughter's performance as a form o evaluation of her own ability to teach and rear a child.In conclusion, it's the kind of movie that makes me happy I have a Netflix subscription.One final thing: I don't entirely understand what was Mother's plan with Daughter going out of the bunker with Woman or even what was Daughter supposed to learn from that. Most importantly, I'm not sure why Mother determined that Daughter was ready or why she couldn't keep helping. That part of the conflict felt contrived. The whole ending seemed a bit rushed or nonsensical to me."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Plot/Story: 5/10 very little happening, with very little pay off at the end.

A few decent scenes, and interesting set design as well as graphics design for the set. Not much in terms of broad composition though.Overall, an okay movie that left me wanting more.

In this film, various philosophical issues and ethical dilemmas are presented.  If you discussed \"three men in a lifeboat\" in your freshman dorm room - you will probably like this story.Hilary Swank provides a very good performance.Clara Rugaard is well cast as Daughter.  She was 21 years old when she provided her performance - which I thought was too old - but, she comes off as a teenager and it worked very well.  Rugaard's acting provided a good balance a nativity and intelligence which made the role interesting.The film is well written.  I would very much recommend this film for individuals who enjoy science fiction films.An observation... in the first 8 minutes of the film, various statistics are printed on the screen to provide viewers with background information which assists in understanding the plot.  It has been suggested that the last 2 statistics perhaps give a little too much information - which in my estimation could perhaps not be the case."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "its fairly dark, creepy and slowpaced.

There are WAY too many unanswered backstory questions left dangling so this turns out to be a very unsatisfying story. However - as others have said similarly - there was so much potential that was just squandered at the end. It really started going off the rails when Hillary Swank's un-named character entered. None of that from that point on was neither well-motivated nor made cohesive sense. This really, really needs to be a mini-series, it's a wasted effort in this treatment.

Grant Sputore did a really impressive job directing this movie.  The robots moved really well, the photography was perfect.  Acting was flawless and the script was excellent.

The photographer has a new Lovecraft movie coming with Nicolas Cage called Color Out of Space that looks good too."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "The premise was great but the final 15 mins or so it tried so hard to set up for a sequel so it didn't really finish with an uppercut. Swank's character was underdeveloped and the idea that the little girl could have any concept of reality or human interaction is just not consistent with human nature."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "I am mother has potential! It's just never utilized! It could be a spiritual successor to Terminator, but thankfully it isn't.From the start, the idea of a robot raising a human being can be debunked by the fact that every organism learns trough imitation. Humans learn to express emotions and non-verbal communication by watching their parents and people around them. Without that influence, a person will always severely lack behind in social skills.As for the plot of the movie, clearly they had a basic concept and never decided to enrich it. Questions that appear from the start (for example the fact that the girl is barely 18, yet the bunker has been online for 13.857 days = 37,8 years) could be answered within 20 minutes, but the writer decided to stretch them out over the entire movie. The result is that the movie feels empty of much substance and meaning, and is too slow to be sufficiently entertaining.The two actresses both don't offer much in the way of a memorable appearance. Hilary Swank mostly looks like she's tormented by the smell of faeces, and the girl has barely any personality. Either through a dominant parent robot or just being a **** the girl makes questionable decisions and creates more problems than neccessary.Then there's the moment that answers are revealed. To be honest, i saw it coming after just 15 minutes into the movie. It's so predictable, and even dissapointing when it's finally revealed.It's another average movie that is just okay enough to watch, yet too boring and uninspired to be memorable.

This movie keeps the viewer wondering what will happen next. It is a film about trust and with a lot of heart.

AI related/perhaps somewhat dystopian type watch, although I'm not sure I'd say everything is clearly especially bad at first but what with the looming sounding music/muzack in the background present from the start, there's an unshakable sense of tension provided. The ethics of the future having more emphasis on AI devices and technology in general to, at the very least, help bring up the younger generation, is certainly an interesting subject, one that has been covered by numerous other films. I suppose the core subjects/themes about how much we should trust AI is a little cliched but I still found it an intriguing watch and I wouldn't specifically class myself as a 'full blown' sci-fi fan, mainly as I prefer to watch films with a human element. For the most part, the only sci-fi films I particularly like are those that feature human characters (characters that are humans, not just beings acted by humans) and this film has quite a strong human element to it, which did appeal.I thought Hilary Swank gave a good performance, seeming really quite convincing as her character (only known as 'woman'), with quite pained facial expressions showing her emotions (concern/sadness etc.) very clearly. The rest of the cast do well in their roles too and I can't deny that I felt it was a bit chilling how Mothers voice (supplied by Rose Byrne) was so seemingly un-human, fake and yet the isolated human learns to bond with it.I can't say much more for fear of providing spoilers but I felt it was a reasonably spooky/chilly watch - not a horror film but a fairly thought provoking, decent sci-fi drama type film. It is pretty slow paced but I found it a fairly  engrossing watch regardless and I'd recommend it to others."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This movie was awesome! This is a Netflix Original sci-fi film. It is in the \u201ctwo or three people in an isolated environment with a robot and insidious stuff going on\u201d subgenre of sci-fi. Other films in this subgenre include Ex Machina and Moon. I loved those movies, and I loved this too! In the future, some kind of apocalyptic disaster has taken place and one robot named Mother is tasked with growing and raising humans to repopulate the planet. The film follows Mother\u2019s only child, Daughter, and her desire to know what lies beyond the walls of the facility she was born and raised in. It kind of sounds like a The Little Mermaid or Hotel Transylvania setup, but it gets really crazy from there. This film is very moody and atmospheric. It\u2019s cold, claustrophobic and tense, but also cozy, warm and inviting. It makes you feel so many different things. The story is very engaging. The performances are all great except for Daughter\u2019s child actor at the very beginning, and the effects are excellent! The CGI and sets look great, but the best part of this movie is Mother. She is not CGI. She is an animatronic suit. She\u2019s awesome! She looks better than any of the robots out of the recent Star Wars movies! I\u2019d say this movie is worth seeing for her alone, but the rest of the movie around her is so good that I think that would be doing the film a disservice. Honestly, there\u2019s not much I can say about this movie without giving things away so I think I\u2019ll just leave things there.
