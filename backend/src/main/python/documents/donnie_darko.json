The director should just stick with what he actually understands, rather than pretend like he knows how wormholes and dimensions work. Also, if the audience requires online discussions in order to understand just a portion of a movie's meaning, then that's a clear sign of an unsatisfactory movie with very poor writing and execution. This movie is one of the best examples of that. It should've been able to stand on its own without much outside research. Overall, the movie is edgy, pretentious, confusing, nonsensical, filled with pseudoscience, and struggles to give any sort of clarity in its messages. On top of that, it's really really boring.."

The story is really interesting and pretty mysterious in the beginning and you get to know what is really happening only in the end (if you want to find the real meaning  watch the director's version, it contains some necessary scenes).

It's funny without losing it's grim tone, it's a physiological thriller that blends themes of time travel and isolation into a coherent plot, and it is an drama so well portrayed that even the most illogical components of this tale are believable in its world.\rThe main character, Donnie, is a teenager with schizophrenia who is met by a human wearing a demonic-rabbit Halloween costume. This rabbit tells him that the world is too end in 28 days, due to a part of the world that Donnie was closest to collapsing. Donnie is the only one that can save the universe, as he was the primary receiver to the event that is threatening to destroy the universe. I won't say what the event is as it would partially ruin its unravelling throughout the film. This sets up what is to be a fascinatingly complex thriller.\rDonnie's character is an mysterious oddity for much of the film, yet he still manages to be sympathetic enough for you to side with him in this mind bending story. 'Darko' deals with very advanced subject matter without being up its own arse, as well as dealing with ideas of remoteness and even young love without becoming preachy.\rIt will leave you saddened yet satisfied, as the ending is so well wrapped up. Everything about this film is wonderful. This may sound clich\u00e9, but it remains a must see, even 13 years on from its release."

The movie enthralled me, gripped my attention, and spat me out into a mangled but hypnotized mess.  I did have a few problems with it though.  The time travel elements aren't explained very well, which leads to some occasional headache inducing confusion.  I also found that the ending, like Roger Ebert said, lacked closure.

      "text": "(skip to the last paragraph for a concise one-sentence summary and a number)\rDon\u2019t get me wrong. Donnie Darko is a wonderful film, full of suspense, motion, and a constantly intriguing, if not unsettling mood. However, it\u2019s plagued with two problems: it\u2019s too ambitious, and it never stops to give the audience time to collect its thoughts.\rFirstly, the ambition. It appears that director Richard Kelly had a lot on his mind for this story. Filmmaking is an art that cthat cthat cannot be done without vast imagination and a spinning mind. Unfortunately, Kelly\u2019s ambition got the best of him. The result is an overly-thrilling roller coaster ride that simultaneously intrigues and disorients its riders. Even the \u201cresolution\u201d at the end with Frank the rabbit (a character I personally like) and the storm of the tangent universe couldn\u2019t clean up the mess that was Donnie Darko\u2019s plotline.\rA bigger problem with the film was its rushing speed. There was never one moment where Donnie stopped to explain to the audience what exactly was going on (one of his therapy sessions could have done this seamlessly). Instead, we are given sporadic (and untimely) ten-second excerpts from a woman\u2019s philosophical discoveries in time travel. Again, this results in a disorienting roller coaster ride that would be a lot more fun if Kelly had taken a moment to decelerate and catch the audience up on the twisting plotline.\rIn conclusion, this is what I have to say: the film had a very interesting premise, a fascinatingly somber ambiance, and some wildly good moments of suspense and filmmaking genius (most of which involved Frank and/or sleepwalking). Sadly, its ultimate potential was not met, and what could have been one of the best films of the year turned out instead to be a flurry of ambitious ideas riddled with sci-fi fancies and schizophrenic attacks.\r FINAL SCORE: 65 (a neat watch ----------o---------- pretty good)"

The acting by both Jake Gyllenhaal and Drew Barrymore is some of their best work. The rest of the cast also shines with a special kudos to Holmes Osborne as the father in what is almost always a throw away role.\r The school and kids remind me of my high school from the eighties (Though this being Hollywood the music is much better than what the radio actually played in those years.) and the filmmakers certainly know how to frame a shot. I was even able to look past the Holden Caulfield and Harvey flashbacks the movie caused me to suffer.\r So what went wrong\u2026 the plot. Oh up until the payoff it's fine enough, in fact it is better than fine. One wonders how the filmmakers are going to pull it off. The answer is simple. They don't. If anything the end of the movie reminded me of that atrocious horror film from a few years back Soul Survivors. Like Soul Survivors the movie holds your interest with more and more implausible plot twists and coincidences then cheats at the end like a bad junior high school English essay.\r Now Donnie Darko is otherwise superior to Soul Survivors and other films where the ending is a groaner (cough The Village cough), but after all that goodness the magic is gone and they couldn't pull a rabbit out of their hat.

It 'a significant moment for Donnie life.\r\rWhere are the parents Donnie?\rWhy he went to Grandma Death home at midnight?\rWho is inside the cellar?\rWhat happens to Gretchen (Jena Malone)\rDonnie and Frank of the two ...\rLast but not the least disturbing question: WHERE IS DONNIE DARKO?\r\rpsychiatry / theoretical / physical science fiction.\r\rOne thing is certain, in my opinion, many of the people who are in contact with Donnie, do not pose any kind of question about life and existence. They are pervaded by the \"newspaper\" and that's enough for them to live a life \"happy\". When Donnie tries to deepen \"with professionals in the know\" some issues about the purpose of life or the existence, receives only traces of knowledge. And any kind of pedagogical mediation.\r\rAnd 'her CAPACITY' REFLECTIVE that allows it to:\r\rfocus your attention on a particular situation;\rdevelop ideas that seeks to order;\rachieve a goal;\rAll this is not possible if you are not in a position to know how to research, investigate and then sort them into logical sequences; seriously consider all that may sound belief;\rI do not think that Donnie a \"psychiatric illness.\" I mean, for me the \"workings of his mind,\" her cognitive namely: perception, learning, problem solving, memory, attention, language, emotions, has a coefficient very high, far above his peers and hardly perceptible by adults. \"The most\" difficult \"students are entitled to have the best teachers.\" I believe this maxim EXTRAORDINARY. E 'succeeded despite the ......... of events to transform his suffering, his trouble, in a situation emotionally soothing, quiet, and why not harmonious. Everything fits together perfectly.\rThe neurosciences have a duty to give meaning to the lives of patients, who struggle to see SE themselves projected into a future that has a meaning, not only; and possibly full of hope.\r\r8. In here, I can only mention the text by Roberta Ann Sparrow \"The philosophy of the trips in the time.\"\r\rContent:\r\rPremise\rThe Tangent Universe\rWater and Metal\rThe Artifact and the Living\rThe Living Receiver\rThe Manipulated Living\rThe Manipulated Dead\rdreams\rappendix\r\rMore I can not for obvious reasons.\r\r9. \"Wormhole\" or \"of\" Einstein-Rosen Bridge \".\r\rWhich train is faster, that of Theoretical Physics or that of Sci?\r\r1905, Albert Einstein published a study on the compatibility between mechanics and electromagnetism. (Or special theory of relativity);\r1915, Albert Einstein published a further work on relativity (theory of general relativity);\rThe space-time or chronotope is a four-dimensional space, that is, 3-dimensional space and time as a coordinated addition. So no more distinction between space and time. The observer has to radically change his way of seeing and thinking (vision and static thought). In different situations and conditions the concept of forward - behind; right left; high Low; changes.\rThe Einstein-Rosen bridge is a short street, a short path, which allows to reach a different universe in less time. Also called wormholes - \"worm hole\", is also called tunnel space - time; of tarla tunnel or burrow of worm. This \"hole\" allows you to travel and to exceed the speed of light.\rTake two small funnels, add them through the spout, place them vertically, and you've got a fantastic and wonderful tunnel space - time. The WORMHOLE.\rMy job ends here. The huge amount of scientific data that can be processed deserve well other professionals. I'm not.\rI hope to have intrigued the reader and this is enough for me. The insights are dependent variables. Before leaving you carry a maximum beautiful Victor Hugo: Zero, not wanting to go around, naked, she has run vanity dress. Mine is a modest work, a further measured contribution to the many already.\r\rGood Ciak!"

Jake Gyllenhaal's great acting game is still at a young age and the most important thing is not a spoiled ending. It is recommended to watch only the director's version"
