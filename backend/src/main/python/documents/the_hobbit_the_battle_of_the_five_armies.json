      "text": "I was as irritated as most people when I heard that Peter Jackson would split The Hobbit into three movies because it was obviously a decision based on nothing more than getting as much money as possible, but even I never imagined that he would stoop to making a movie like Battle of the Five Armies (a.k.a. Battle of the 25 Armies plus a couple of random giant mountain goats and a pig thrown in for good measure).\r The CGI was as bad as something you would see in a B movie\u2014even worse than the previous two Hobbit films. But even more noticeably, the script took a dive to rock bottom. Within the first half hour, such utterly laughable clich\u00e9s as \u201cYou make me feel alive,\u201d were spoken in a cheesy love scene that seemed like something straight out of Saturday Night Live, except that the audience was apparently supposed to take it seriously.\r Shortly before the battle started, there were a few much-needed moments of comic relief, and I thought the film might possibly turn around. But all my illusions were soon shattered during the ten-minute scene where Thorin walks on top of the ice that Azog is floating under with his eyes open, following the orc and apparently waiting for him to break through it, when\u2014suprise!\u2014he does, and (spoiler for those who have not yet watched the ten-minute scene that made this obvious) kills Thorin. Alas. It might have been sad if I hadn\u2019t been waiting around for ten minutes knowing that he would get killed.\r Things were looking grim for the dwarves when who should appear? Our heroes the eagles, of course, who have managed to bail out the protagonists in every single movie of the trilogy.\r Although I couldn\u2019t stop laughing during the scene where three dwarves find completely random giant mountain goats with no riders in the middle of the battle and proceed to ride them up a mountain, the worst part of the movie was easily the ending. As if the movie isn\u2019t long enough, the audience is not only forced to watch Bilbo go all the way BACK to the Shire, they have to re-watch footage from Fellowship of the Ring! I knew it was a bad sign that Peter Jackson actually made a movie shorter than three hours (although it felt like six)\u2014apparently, he had so little material for this movie that he had to re-use material from his original trilogy.\r When Tauriel discusses love with the abominably cliched line \u201cWhy does it hurt so much?\u201d I think she described the feelings of most of the audience enduring the latest Hobbit movie."

I feel as if it did a discredit to the amazing book behind it,  and the tales of Middle Earth as a whole.\r The CGI was awful and unfortunately plentiful. The battle scenes were rife with a gawdy comic feeling, rendering all attempts at reiterating the epic scenes from the ring trilogy useless.\rThe pacing and dialogue were incredibly inconsistent, and many sections dragged on for way too long.\r A very disappointing end to the movie adaptations of Tolkiens gift to all of us."

      "text": "A slow and tedious close to a series that lost its edge a decade ago.\r Here's a few reasons why Christopher Tolkien is a saint for turning down millions to keep Jackson from defecating on his father's work:\r 1) The Necromancer story arc ends up just being another crappy fight scene (why the hell is Saurumon's magical power Kung-Fu?) that feels more like a teaser for the LotR series. This would have been a perfect opportunity to expand on the back stories and roles presented in the Silmarillion. Doesn't happen, instead we get a lame light show.\r 2) What about the fight scenes we've all been waiting for? This would have also been an AWESOME opportunity to show off more of Beorn doing cool bear-man stuff but he's limited to a 2 second cameo.  Instead we see more combat involving Bard's 12 year old son. Great call.\r 3) The epic battle and armies feel more like rival gangs. I swear to god when the dwarfs show up it feels like I'm watching The Warriors. This battle didn't feel anywhere near as epic as it should have. It's not like cost is a limiting factor when everything is CGI. I don't understand why they didn't render in larger armies.\r 4) The movie moves at a crawl. They really drag out Thorin's Dragon Sickness and the only reason seems to be they gotta fill up time. I love it when Thorin sobers up and then asks his crew if they're willing to go out and fight... which is what they've been pleading for this entire time. What was with that sinking into gold scene? The CG was so bad I thought we were going to get a Beast Wars cameo.\r 5) The movie opens with Smaug's attack on Lake Town which SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED IN THE LAST FILM. Smaug's attack and death feel so anti-climatic that I'm 100% sure the decision to keep Smaug alive into this movie was just so Cumberbatch could help in the film's advertisement. For Christ's sake he has 3 lines.\r 6) Martin Freeman looks bored. Maybe the rest of the movie poisoned my mood but Bilbo seems like he's reading off lines. Hell, he doesn't even feel like the film's hero, Alfrid the Master's lackey gets more screen time.\r All of this has been done before and done better in the original trilogy. This could have been something great if Jackson and crew didn't phone it in as a cash grab.\r But I should end on a positive note: Hugo Weaving is still a bad ass and the only reason why this film doesn't get a 0."

Bard using his son as a component of his bow to kill Smaug was insulting to the excellently done dragon.  The conversation between Legolas and his father was very cringe worthy and nothing looked more awkward than Galadriel carrying Gandalfs unconscious body.  The Hobbit is also not supposed to heavily tie into Lord of the Rings.  They are two very different tones that clash uncomfortably.\r I encourage the use of CGI in special effects but it needs to be done correctly.  Including practical effects gives your CGI artists something with real light and texture to work off of.  That could have helped because a lot of this movies CGI looked like it needed work or they ran out of money."

      "text": "Time to say goodbye to middle earth for the last time.\r The story is about Dwarven party led by Thorin Oakenshield finally reclaims their kingdom of Erebor, the vast treasure draws out now only the wrath of Smaug but also the army of men and elves, who want the fortune for their own.\r Let me give you a quick feed back of the other two films then to this one. A unexpected Journey I thought was pretty amazing... when I first sawed it, after a couple of watchers later it's not as amazing as the first time, but I still enjoyed it even with the problems showing. Desolation of smaug in my opinion was way better and way more fun and better film paste then Unexpected Journey, and Smaug as the villain was icing on the cake. Now we got Battle of the Five Armies and I can conform that the movie is actually pretty good and it's a solid finale to The Hobbit series.\r Peter Jackson directs this movie in a way that middle earth feels like a real pace that we can go to anytime we want and I got to give him that. Jackson clearly adores middle earth as he really doesn't want it to end and I can see why, it probably makes him feel at home directing these movies and sometimes leaving you home behind sucks.\r The visual effect's at times looked really good and once again this movie had that shiny mix with grey color with the character's Armour and the background of beautiful New Zealand. But I like the Lord of the Rings effect's a little better, why you may ask. because the effect's in that movie still holds up today but that's just me... maybe.\r The all the cast members did a outstanding job, Ian Mckellen will always be Gandalf because his the best, Martian Freeman did a fantastic job playing Bilbo Baggins and to be honest I like Bilbo Baggins more then frodo in my opinion.\r My biggest problems with the film is some of the visual effect's in the movie looks very noticeable and I had the same problem with the other two films. The love story between Kili (The Dwarf) and Tauriel (The Elf), I didn't find their romance plot to really needed for the film and when something bad happens to the two of them I just sitting thinking \"Well stuff happens\".\r Overall The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies is a solid final to the Hobbit series with some problems there and then. Good action scenes, good performances and a brutal fight scenes."

      "text": "Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy has so far been entertaining yet a disappointment in comparison to it's Lord of the Rings bigger brothers. However after a promising final act in the Desolation of Smaug things were looking up for The Battle of the Five Armies...luckily that pulled through.\rThe Battle of the Five Armies takes place immediately after the events of the Desolation of Smaug, beginning as Smaug reaches Laketown. As Bilbo (Martin Freeman) the dwarves retake the city of Erebor in the Lonely Mountain, war is on the horizon as Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) becomes blind with wealth and power; the citizens of Laketown are left without a home; the woodland elves seek a treasure stolen from them and the Orc's led by Azog the defiler (Manu Bennett) want to claim Erebor to give them an upper hand in the coming age of the Orc.\rThe majority of the film is action sequences, beginning with Smaug's destruction of Laketown and culminating in the titular battle of the five armies. As such the pacing for the film is much faster than that of any of the previous Middle Earth films, allowing much less room for downtime and filler. The shorter runtime also lends in it's favour as the Hobbit films thusfar have been rather bloated with relatively pointless and at times boring sequences with little relevance to the actual plot.\rMy biggest problem with the two previous Hobbit films is the overuse of some shoddy CGI effects, BoFA does improve it's CG quality somewhat but ultimately pays the price again by literally swamping the film in CGI, particularly the opening sequence and the entire five armies battle. The CGI is so excessive in the film that it even produces frame rate stutter, something relatively unseen in the film industry but something extremely common in the video games industry. This could be due to the use of 48FPS over industry standard 28, but whatever the reason it does lower the quality of the film.\rThat being said this is the best Hobbit film in the trilogy, what it lacks in particular defining moments (such as AUJ's Gollum scene & Dos' Smaug scenes) it makes up for in scale, pacing and a very satisfying and brutal battle sequence that lasts most of the films second half; the biggest in Peter Jackson's Middle Earth films to date.\rA fitting farewell to Middle Earth, Bilbo, Gandalf and the rest of the characters we have come to know and love over the past 13 years and despite it's faults an extremely enjoyable film."

      "text": "This, in my opinion, was the only decent one in The Hobbit line of movies, and I am a HUGE fan of Tolkien's Epic. But there are still some things going wrong here. First of all, I am really bothered by how you guys went through all the trouble of making the orcs look all badass, and then they act like they have never had fighting lessons in their life. Even little dwarfs and hobbits are running around killing them left and right. It really looks kind of like you're playing Dynasty Warriors or something.The entire screenplay is written in an asinine manner. Gandalf keeps telling these morons that there is a huge army of Orcs on the way, but everyone stands around and argues with each other rather than preparing an organized defense. Thorin stands there and watches his cousin's people get slaughtered, and then without any sort of explanation snaps out of \"the spell\" (gold can cast spells in this movie, but Gandalf apparently cannot). But does Thorin immediately rally the troops to go fight? No, he instead makes a long melodramatic speech, and when they finally do run out it looks like maybe 15 Dwarves. What the hell are 15 more Dwarves going to do in this situation? (Let's go after the leader, we'll just easily ride right on through this army that has been destroying us for a half hour now.)I couldn't stop laughing when the giant troll thing knocked himself out to punch a hole in the wall. But I also had to wonder why they even brought trebuchets at all just to use them for about 15 seconds.Here you have Gandalf, now he is supposedly like the best wizard around (even before his Zen Buddhism experience), but he really doesn't do anything wizardly. I mean, these guys are surrounded by orcs and giant worms (what happened to the worms by the way; they were there for one scene then they were gone), you would expect to see him shooting fireballs and all kinds of other stuff like he did in LOTR trilogy. But no, he doesn't even bother to charge his staff with lightning or anything when he hits fully armored orcs in the face. Maybe he invested too many stat points into strength and not enough into Magicka? If he was going to play battle-mage then why was he not wearing heavy armor? Gandalf and Bilbo Baggins pretty much stand there most of the time and shout things like \"fall back.\" I guess at some point the screenwriters remembered that Bilbo has a magic invisibility ring, because they decided to have him use it for no other purpose than delivering a message in the middle of battle that really didn't do any good anyways. He could have been running around all invisible-like killing orcs, but instead he was the mailman.Elf chick decides to go rescue her boyfriend (not in the book), who inevitably dies saving her life. Now the funny thing here is that elf chick herself has killed countless orcs during the course of the movie, but she gets tossed around like a ragdoll by this one. But of course, Legolas (also not in the book) comes along and is able to elf kung-fu this orc who for some reason seems to be able to fight a hundred times better than any of the other obes. This after somehow jumping up a trail of falling rocks and without even appearing to have super speed. It was absolutely spectacular to witness, though I have to question the physics of this universe they are in.Elf king tells Legolas to go find Strider (Aragorn) who, according to the timeline of the stories, was still a child growing up amongst elves. You are telling me that the elves don't know where is the human ranger in their own kingdom?All in all, this was not a terrible movie, but it was a terrible Tolkien port. Most of the Tolkien fans are adults now. We like adult movies that also feature some form of cohesive logic with regards to how the world operates and what constitutes a wizard. This series was so obviously meant for children. 5/10, +1 for all the laughs.Peter Jackson, retire."

The result is probably the most dissatisfying element of the film.\"The hobbit\" is surely worth to watch, just let your senses enjoy, even If \"The Hobbit\" doesn't equal the achievement of Jackson's earlier Middle-earth movies."

I don't think there is one consecutive minute of this film which doesn't have CGI. What happened to The Lord of the Rings mentality, people say? It got corrupted, ironically in the same way Thorin gets corrupted in the movie; but unfortunately it doesn't redeem itself.\r And let's talk more about the CGI. One would naively expect, since it's the primary feature of this movie, that it be at least done well. And it isn't: half of the scenes look completely fake - there is no desire anywhere to produce at least a technical masterpiece. The Return of the King was made with a third the budget and more than 10 years prior, but it's still technically better, from the costumes to the makeup to the scenery.\r Now for the editing: especially at the beginning, there are several weird cuts to unrelated scenes, and it all results in a confusing storyline (not in the good sense, not in the Pulp Fiction sense), with the battle scenes lasting forever, to a point when, 90 minutes in, one finds theirselves asking \"Are we done yet?\" Moreover, they decided NOT to complete The Desolation of Smaug with its natural ending, that is the slaying of the dragon, but to drag it at the beginning of the third movie, I assume in an attempt to force people who liked the second to buy a ticket for the third to find out what happens to Smaug, with a cheap sit-com mentality.\r The Battle of the Five Armies is a pain to watch, never wants to end, and if you were to take a nap during the middle of the film you wouldn't lose one single important element of plot. It's not epic, it's not funny, it's not beautiful, it's not anything positive really. The producers must feel ashamed, but don't say you weren't expecting this."

The Lord of the Rings trilogy, despite their own warts and occasionally misguided narrative decisions, are perhaps some of the most influential and emotionally engaging fantasy epics to ever be put on-screen.  The hurdles jumped through to put J.R.R. Tolkein's trilogy on screen is one of the most amazing feats of creativity and ingenuity in cinematic history.   But Peter Jackson, whether in frustration or in delusion, has somehow managed to completely lose course of what made those films resonate.\r What we're left with is an effort to take a generally light-hearted adventure tale, and to make it an enormous, emotional spectacle filled with characters who we are told to care about because... well, we are told to care about them.  For all its thousands of on-screen characters engaging in thunderous action, and the dramatic soundtrack trying to emphasize each moment as a tragic and important, very little of it comes to mean anything.  The film's final action scene more or less encompasses half the movie, but unlike any of the Lord of the Rings movies, the narrative of these battles never feels clear.\r The film is not without its talent.  The talented cast aren't given much, but Richard Armitage's Thorin and Martin Freeman's Bilbo both manage to have atleast a handful of moments that resonate with one another and form a somewhat human core to this final act, even if it never felt as powerful as that of Frodo and Sam.  The rest of the cast reads their lines well and with intent, but as with the trilogy as a whole, it all ultimately feels fake and contrived.  The romance between the elf Tauriel and the dwarf Kili, and element that never existed in the books, never feels real or something we as an audience are meant to attach too.  Like the actors on countless green-screen sets talking to elevated tennis balls, we are told to believe that we are staring at something real and to respond accordingly, but we just know it's a lie.  Instead it just reads hollow.\r As with all of Jackson's Middle-Earth films, the artistry behind the world creates some striking vistas and beautiful ornate armor and creatures.  However, it still continues to be a shame that we lose so much of the tangibility in the director's increased reliance on CG instead of the beautiful (and sometimes terrifying) work created by the practical effects artists in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  Moment to moment, it becomes harder to believe what any of what you're seeing is real.  Billy Connolly's own character was entirely replaced by a CG representation, which tragically illustrates the lengths to which he'll allow the work of his actors and artists be replaced by hollow animated puppets.\r In the beautifully put-together and extensive behind-the-scenes documentaries in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, there is an exceptionally poignant moment when Peter Jackson is directing the final shot with Frodo, played by Elijah Wood.  Jackson, trying to fight off his tears, struggling to say \"cut\" and finally end the filming, and instead continues to ask Wood to try the scene again.  Once he finally accepts the reality that his time with his cast is over, he embraces Wood and thanks him as the two shed tears together, ending their incredible once-in-a-lifetime journey with one another.  It is a heart-breaking moment for both the crew, as well as we as the audience.  I can't help but wonder what Jackson's attitude was when filming the final shot of these films.  Was it the same challenge to let go?  Was it exhaustion?  Whatever it was, I'm sure he could add some CG tears later to make us believe it's supposed to be a sad moment."

This film is where the cracks began to show, there is simply not enough source material in one book to make these three movies, at the very most two movies would have been enough. While we do get the ending to the story it is after nearly three hours of what feels like stalling, the first fifteen minutes of the movie are the best imho. This really felt like a money making exercise to me."

Although I feel that the other two films were also rather weak, Jackson's failings as a storyteller really come into their own in The Battle of the Five Armies. The film is little more than a showy collection of battle scenes and special effects that drown a poor screenplay, and in themselves are as tiring as they are bloated and pointless. Emotionally uninvolving, uninspiring and entirely forgettable: give me Jackson's old splatstick any day of the week!"

      "text": "It wasn't bad. The battles (battle?) were (was?) pretty impressive, and the characters weren't devoid of emotion. In short, the film wasn't soulless, but that isn't saying much. The film's main problem comes from its conception, the fact that it's based on the third act of a single novel. That makes this film, in effect, just one big third act stretched into two and a half hours. So it starts with finale-style action (Smaug dying) and continues with it right through to the end. Because of its source material, it can't really have a beginning, middle and end; that's what the first two parts of the trilogy are. The Lord of the Rings was based on three books with their own three acts, each part of a greater story arc; Peter Jackson has his greater story arc with the Hobbit, but that's just the plot to the book. Each individual film doesn't really have its own individual story, and that really tells in the Battle of Five Armies. It feels like the end of a film and not a film in itself. That said, it doesn't do too badly at concluding Middle-earth. It's no classic, but it's still worth seeing, if just to get a sense of closure with Tolkien's universe."

It all follows the book to an acceptable point (except from the trolls, what are they doing there?).\r Suddenly, Jackson decides to make THAT turn away from the original story, and we don`t follow the battle of the five armies any longer, we follow Legolas, Tauriel, Fili, Kili, Dwalin and Thorin vs Azog, Bolg and another army. All that in an ice covered \"battle arena,\" just to make the whole thing more epic. And suddenly, the battle is over, and now Jackson wants to focus on Bilbo, and just Bilbo, without concluding the other story lines 100%.

And I guess I could say it's fun to watch.\r This third part, though, shows how unnecessary it was to split this one single book into three (!) parts, each taking about 2 hours and 40 minutes.\r The Battle of the Five Armies hasn't got much story in it, as it is mostly told on the first two parts of the trilogy, and here we come to the grand finale, where, well, most of the characters mainly fight. And fight. And fight. And fight. And fight.\r There were some moving moments, and some light moments, which is good, but still - most of the time I've seen only violence on the screen. There was simply not much else to show, because, as I said, there's not much of the story left to tell..\rBut how would we make a trilogy with each title lasting alone almost 3 hours?\rOf course, let's stretch those battles on and on!\r Well, that didn't work that well in my opinion folks.\r And yes, technically this is still a good movie.

      "text": "The final entry to \"The Hobbit\" will leave you flabbergasted. The utterly incredulous \"Trilogy\" has finally hit rock bottom. Lines of actual dialogue are so few and far between that one can forget that the garbage in front of you is in fact a film, not a computer game. The characters are woefully underdeveloped as a result, and it is impossible to sympathise or care about almost anyone. The initial bit with Smaug was ok until he went all monologue **** on us and started the clich\u00e9 \"bad guy talks to much before he gets undone by a seemingly impossible feat\" scenario.\r As I've hinted, my biggest problem with this film is the absurd special effects. There is so much going on, and the shots so short - you barely have time to understand what the **** is happening. The aerial shots overlooking the battlefield are done so from such a distance, it is near impossible to tell what any army is doing beyond the first 3 minutes of fighting. Everything down to the loading of arrows, dwarf shield walls, Orc charges, or anything else in the battle worth mentioning is done with a computer.\rI'd have really enjoyed actual people forming up a Dwarven shield wall, or loosing a volley of arrows, but it was not to be...\r The \"journey\" that Thorin Oakenshield  coming back from near insanity took approximately 3 days of my life in energy to care. The sequence when he comes back from the brink of insanity (walking around on the gold floor yada yada yada) is about 180 seconds of close shots of his glowing face, followed by a huge spanning shot of the room he is in. I chose this moment to use the toilet, and believe it or not, he was still ****ing around there when I came back.\r I can't remember if this character was in the book, its been so long, but lets take a moment to talk about \"Alfrid\" played by Ryan Gage\". Scratch that, I went and looked it up. He is an unnamed, barely mentioned character in the books. So why in ****s sake are we subjected to one of the biggest **** in film history? There is just no reason for him to be such an utter **** His plot within the film is totally inconsequential, ending with him running off dressed as a woman with boobs of gold. No I'm not kidding. His purpose, as far as I can gather, is to fill 15+ minutes of dialogue mainly showing just how much of a **** he is.\r My final rant, because I just can't bring myself to remember and write about more of this diabolical film, is of course about a particular character. I saved the best till last..... in a sense.\r Orlando Bloom. I think you are great. You are a funny guy and obviously switched on. Great in Pirates of The Caribbean, smashing in LOTR trilogy, and I especially enjoyed your performance in Extras (Ricky Gervais). With that in mind then...\r What the **** was Peter Jackson thinking? Ok, I get that you have to option to include Legolas, seeing as he would have been around, but like... What the **** was he doing?\rDuring this one film Legolas managed to:\r - Fly on a bat thing up into some ruins.\r- Drop 30m onto a troll then \"Ratatouille\" style 'drive' the troll (substituting hair for knives in the trolls shoulders)\r- Defy the laws of physics on several occasions\r- Slow motion run up a flight of stairs...........that are falling. Anyone with a braincell can work out why that is ****ing ridiculous, and that's saying something seeing as we are in a world riddled with magic.\r So my main point here is, there is such a fantastic array of things that you could have done within the realms of the world you are bringing to cinema. Indeed, Peter Jackson has the ability to access one of the most interesting, descriptive and magical worlds ever written about. Why did you have to include such utter **** alongside it?\r Other gripes include, but are not limited to:\r - The endless fight scene between Thorin and Azog. I naively thought it was a really cool way to end the fight, by Thorin simply stepping off the precarious ice shard they were both balanced on. Only to have my enthusiasm crushed when his stupid ****ing face showed up under the ice... and clich\u00e9 \"bad guys eyes open again when you think he's dead\"\r - The **** with Legolas being told to go find \"strider\". At the time of that conversation, Aragon was 10 years old, and where did Aragon grow up? ****ing Rivendell. Thanks for the nostalgic **** Peter.\r - Finally, towards the end of the film... which may seem to take months, Gandalf makes a quip to Bilbo about his knowledge of the ring? So why would he wait 60ish years to rush off to Minas Tirith to read old scrolls documenting the ring? The answer is... he doesn't. He doesn't know about the ring until he sees Bilbo vanish completely on his 111th Birthday.\r Today I paid \u00a38 to let Peter Jackson **** in my eyes and ears. I shan't make that mistake again."

      "text": "The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies Review\r Okay, it\u2019s HighChronicler\u2019s Review Time.\rThe Battle of Five Armies is the epic conclusion to Peter Jackson\u2019s Hobbit Film Trilogy. I am a HUGE Lord of the Rings (LOTR) fanboy, HUGE. Like I will engage people in hours long conversations about it and they don\u2019t even want to hear it. I am also a purist, I think that the Book should be reformatted and adopted to be the Screenplay, and from there reformat it to be the Script (Easy, right? Would save Millions of Dollars this way \u2013 you already have the script/screenplay/book.) I am willing to accept Peter Jackson\u2019s adaptation of LOTR as the best book-film translation that we will ever see. EVER. As in Tenn\u2019 Ambar-Metta. That\u2019s right, unto the Ending of the Earth.\rThis Latest Hobbit does little to disappoint. It delivers in film format the thrilling final third of Tolkien\u2019s book. (With a few changes, not all are bad.)\rThe cinematography is strange, but since I saw in 3D with enhanced Framerate, I\u2019m going to attribute the choppy shots and scenes to the weird format. Also with the 3D the environment doesn\u2019t exactly hold up. It looks fake, I don\u2019t know if looks fake with the Standard viewing, but I would expect that it would be better. All-in-All The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is a really, really good movie, with two MAJOR, GLARING, UNACCEPTABLE FLAWS.\rRating: 7.5/10, 3.75 Stars, 75% whatever scale you use.\rIN CASE YOU HAVE NOT READ, HEARD, LISTENED TO, OR SEEN THE HOBBIT IN THE 77 YEARS IT HAS BEEN OUT: SPOLIER ALERT, STOP READING IF YOU DO NOT DESIRE TO HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF THIS FILM\u2019S CLIMAX.\rGeez, I can\u2019t believe I have to do that.\rOkay, I went into the movie with three major things on my mind: The Death of Smaug; Fili, Kili, and Thorin\u2019s Death; and Thorin, Fili, and Kili\u2019s funeral.\rFirst Ten Minutes, Smaug went down with near enough identically to the book, it was different, but wasn\u2019t a bad different. It was fine, checkmark on my list.\rThorin, Fili, and Kili\u2019s Death Scene. Oh boy, this one. I was highly disappointed when they did not pull the text directly into the film here. Thorin\u2019s fight with Azog seemed to go on forever and Fili and Kili did NOT fall defending him. I was upset when I realized that the Dramatic Death of the King\u2019s Nephews was not even close to the way it was. Thorin\u2019s mortally wounded body was found by Beorn surrounded by many corpses of Orc and Goblins. Fili and Kili had fallen defending him. It was tragic, it was Dramatic, and it was perfect. But not in the Movie. NOT ONE BIT!\rHere is text taken from The Hobbit for The Royal Death:\r\u201cThen Beorn stooped and lifted Thorin, who had fallen pierced with spears, and bore him out of the fray. Swiftly he returned and his wrath was redoubled, so that nothing could withstand him, and no weapon seemed to bite upon him. He scattered the bodyguard, and pulled down Bolg himself and crushed him. Then dismay fell on the Goblins and they fled in all directions. But weariness left their enemies with the coming of new hope, and they pursued them closely, and prevented most of them from escaping where they could. They drove many of them into the Running River, and such as fled south or west they hunted into the marshes about the Forest River; and there the greater part of the last fugitives perished, while those that came hardly to the Wood-elves' realm were there slain, or drawn in to die in the trackless dark of Mirkwood. Songs have said that three parts of the goblin warriors of the North perished on that day, and the mountains had peace for many a year\u2026 \u2026 Of the twelve companions of Thorin, ten remained. Fili and Kili had fallen defending him with shield and body, for he was their mother's elder brother. The others remained with Dain; for Dain dealt his treasure well.\u201d\r NOT COOL. Did I even mention that Beorn shows up for all about 10 seconds.\r Then the Funeral. Oh my, it could have been such a scene, IF IT WAS EVEN IN THE MOVIE!\r These two things alone are why my rating is dropped from a 9 or 10. The Two most important things to me were botched. Granted the Death scene was not as bad I was thinking while watching it, but It still wasn\u2019t what it should have been.\r Mayhaps the Extended Edition will have Thorin\u2019s Funeral, and Beorn have more screen time. If so the ratings will spike to 8.75/10, 4.5 Stars and 85%."

They are all still there, but to a lesser degree--the CGI has definitely improved, the stunts are still laughable but much much shorter, and they spent less time trying to make this about The White Council (they have just one real scene together).\r My complaints are simple: the love triangle was awful and never worked, despite Tauriel being a decent character; there are times where the movie (intentionally) makes you laugh only to instantly cut to the slaughter civilians (it was very awkward); they also were very heavy-handed with the corruption of greed (we got it, a million times over); not enough Dwarf character development (something they have continually failed at).\r It was still a good, fun movie. It did a good job of emphasizing events that did lead to the LOTR series--especially with showing how the ring is slowly and subtly corrupting Bilbo--without taking away from the there and now. However, this is a battle movie. There is action, combat, explosions and destruction. Peter Jackson, IMO unfortunately, focused on these instead of the great characters he had to work with. To this day, none of the fans of the films (that have not read the books) know the names of the dwarves besides Thorin and Kili (and by extension, Fili)."

Instead of joy I just keep hitting scenes thinking \"oh wow how can he screw up this time.\" This feeling extended to the final film. I don't need Thorin facing off in a duel on an icy river. I don't need an interracial love triangle with elves and dwarves. Smaug was great, but that was about it.
