      "text": "This movie was bland, predictable and felt like a episode of Law and Order were Sam Jackson was a guest star. It takes cliched tropes for these kinds of movies and just runs through the motions. The lead, who put forth such a dull performance I forgot his name, wears a look of guilt on his face so obvious it's odd that the other characters can't tell he's guilty of something. I only checked out this flick cause it was free and now I've erased it from my hard drive. It's a very boring thriller that offers no thrills since you can already tell how it's gonna end. Just watch three episodes of Law and Order and you have just spent your time better."

      "text": "District Attorney, Mitch Brockden (Dominic Cooper), goes out one night to celebrate a big victory, and fearing for the safety of his car, in a bad neighborhood, decides to drive home drunk. On the way, he hits a kills a man, running across the street. Another man, Clinton Davis (Samuel L. Jackson) is charged with the crime and it's Brockden's job to prosecute the man accused of committing his crime. Not wanting to convict an innocent man, Brockden blows the case, but afterwards finds out that the wounds on the man he hit, were not consistent with being hit by a car, and match the wounds of seven unsolved homicide victims. Now Brockden must find out if he mistakenly let a serial killer go free. Reasonable Doubt, unlike many similar films, actually had a unique and original story. Both Dominic Cooper and Samuel L. Jackson were terrific, and the film really could have been the hidden gem of the year, but only got 3.5 stars. The reason is simple, while it was a great story, it was far too predictable to be what it could have been. I really it hate when the Writers assume that the audience is too dumb to figure out what's going on. That's what happens here, while the story is tremendous, everything is laid out in such a way, that even a child would know what would happen next. Aside from that, the great story and terrific cast make for an exciting film, that was quite enjoyable, but it was just predictable to a fault."

Nothing amazing about Reasonable Doubt, but worth watching for movie lovers.Not a great movie, but I would be more critical of it I saw ads for it every other commercial. At least they knew this was not a big event movie while releasing it."

Here's one (the biggest one): a district attorney thinks he'll be fine if he drives home intoxicated. He hits someone, and they end up dead. Then he's the lawyer involved in the case."

      "text": "\"Reasonable Doubt\" seems more like an unfinished script as a finished film. Unoriginal, illogical, predictable, unitelligent.\r Really remarkable about the film is only one thing: The running time is given by 91 minutes. In fact, he has only 80 minutes. The closing credits have more than 11 minutes. I think that's a world record. This has otherwise only epic-films with a running time of 3 hours.\r So \"Reasonable Doubt\" is an absolute bluff-package. In every respect."

      "text": "Critics didn't like this movie much, 19 of 100 at Meta Score is Overwhelming Dislike...\r Samuel Jackson as a villain in the film may be one problem.  Not that he wouldn't be a good bad guy, but he does rarely play one.  Big Stars always wanna be loved... and in this one the Bad part about Sam is hard to find.  He seems innocent throughout, no real 'I'm a killer' tension from the script.  Even at the end it's hard to believe that 'The Jack Man' would be huntin' us!\r The DA, the other main character in the film, isn't too bright... he does any number of boneheaded things, especially for someone who is supposed to be on the side of Justice.  So there isn't much to cling to in our fabled 'good guy' area.\r VERDICT: lacks punch"

Jackson se serait \u00e9gar\u00e9 pour payer les r\u00e9parations du toit ; ce ne serait pas la premi\u00e8re fois, cet acteur pourtant excellent a en effet quelques daubes \u00e0 son tableau de service.Ainsi, bien que le sc\u00e9nario ait de la suite dans les id\u00e9es, quelques d\u00e9tails sont trait\u00e9s par dessus la jambe et la r\u00e9alisation terriblement conventionnelle ne l'aide en rien.

      "text": "A solid 6-star movie -- meaning it's entertaining enough to merit watching all the way through, even if it may not be earth-shatteringly stupendous.  In addition, the star, Dominic Cooper, is a rare commodity: a handsome young actor who is not annoyingly glib & cheeky like so many are these days.  Samuel L. Jackson delivers a nicely understated performance, for once not hamming it up as he tends to do.  All the supporting cast is good, including Erin Karpluk and Ryan Robbins; and it was nice to see the lovely Gloria Reuben again (remember her as Dr. Jeanie Boulet of ER?)."
