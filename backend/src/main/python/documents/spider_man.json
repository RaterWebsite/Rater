Each character has a connection and relationship with the next person and it feels much more fluid for this.\rThe film itself is a visual marvel, with the scenes of Spidey swinging through the city quite a delight to watch, and this is blended in with a humorous opening that takes a much more mellow and less serious approach which is a welcome change, they have colourful characters including the undeniable brilliance of J.K. Simmons playing J. Jonah Jameson, his wit, loudness and larger than life personality are standout moments of the film, Tobey Maguire also delivers a convincing performance as our masked spider, he is like a little child at Christmas bouncing around the screen, giving a different feel to the average superhuman.\rBut with the light tone there does come a sense of it being very cartoon-like, with a musical score that reflects this, but there is plenty to be said about the the emotional punch the film has to pack, with very quotable and heart-wrenching dialogue throughout.\rIt's a real kickstarter to a very successful story, and perhaps one of the benchmarks to the overwhelming craze of superhero films today."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Tobey Macguire's excellent performance"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Tobey  played Peter Parker Spider-Man perfectly and Norman Osborn / Green Goblin half nutty and very charismatic.

It has uneven special effects in comparison to what you have these days (it did come out 10 years ago), but Spider-Man encapsulates the best of the super hero genre: heart felt, action packed, pulse pounding.  You'll laugh as Peter Parker discovered his powers for the first time. You'll cringe when he was beaten to a pulp by the goblin in its finale.

A little corny perhaps but in a way that simply works thanks to the actors and characters in the film they play.

Cheesy as hell"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Like I need to tell you but Spider-Man tells the story of Peter Parker, A relatively normal kid who gets bitten by a genetically enhanced spider which turns him into part human, part spider. He discovers he now possesses the ability to shoot webs, to scale walls and a 6th sense when it comes to danger. That being said there are obvious growing pains and Spider-Man handles them with beauty and heart with characters you really care about starting with Parker, who is played to perfection by Tobey Maguire. The rest of the cast also shines with Kirsten Dunst and Rosemary Harris standing out as the women in Peters life. The direction is everything you expect from a popcorn flick but is also incredibly unique with Spidermans movements through the air looking majestic while completely realistic (considering the story). In fact there are very few flaws to Spiderman with it showing that everyone has put their all into the film. If I was forced to pick a problem it would be the slightly disappointing end fight between Spiderman and the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) but even that is clutching at straws. Overall as origin stories go this ones got real class."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Spider-Man was fantastic the story was well written and the characters were amazing.

A movie that showed that being a hero could be fun, though.. of course... with Great Power... well you know the rest.

The villain in the Green Goblin might be a little \"one note\" and crazy for the sake of being crazy, but it doesn't detract from the film too much.

I was seven years old when it first came out and I was thrilled by it, but unlike many other movies I liked as a little kid it still holds up really well. Willem Dafoe was the perfect choice for the Green Goblin, and I have no complaints about the rest of the cast either, though I have heard some about Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst being chosen for their respective roles. Aside from that, the action scenes are exhilarating and the drama was compelling enough to make this movie really memorable for me.

Tobey Maguire is great as Spiderman and Peter Parker and I think he has gotten a lot of undeserved hate since the series was rebooted. As soon as you watch this film you member how good he was and it is difficult to say that Andrew Garfield is more suited to play Spidey.

It looks like a power ranger costume and thats not what the green golbins was in the comics and MJ was all was getting in truble all the time and at the end i just got tried of it happen.
