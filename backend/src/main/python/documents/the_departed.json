Matt was Matt (his best work for me with regards to Damon to this day still remains to be the first remake of the Bourne Identity, but he did a good job here too). Jack was Jack and you can't say anything more. But Leo was definitely the character I empathized with the most and like I said he carried the film. Maybe it was all the hype leading up to me seeing the movie that let me down a bit though the ending was really good. 8/8 Worth the $$$."

He's undercover, struggling with unimaginable anxiety and paranoia which he barely manages to keep a lid on through abuse of anxiolytics and he delivers us a solid and believable character.Mark Wahlberg's outrageous swearing and in-your-face attitude reminds us there are few, if any, true heroes out there.  Faced with the reality of sociopathic criminals and blood-ridden crime scenes even the good guys get gritty.  And on the topic of sociopathy, Jack Nicholson unflinchingly becomes the personification of depravity.  For me, the graphic violence and bad language is justified: these are men pushed to their limits.  And the death of the characters (especially the unexpected death of DiCaprio's character) is shocking and therefore the violence of their deaths should also be shocking."

Critics pretended it was good so that Scorsese could win his best picture that he never won before for the times he really did deserve it like Goodfellas and Casino. This movie was ridiculously unrealistic. Jack Nicholson was horrible in his role. Why would the mob boss be personally involved in all the day to day business? Unrealistic. Why would he personally meet with his police dept. mole in the adult movie theatre and then whip out a s*x toy and do a weird joke thing? That was one of the worst scenes I've ever seen. He was annoying and not all likeable or interesting. He constantly wore that stupid hat and ugly glasses and when he didn't, he had his overly long hair which flared on the sides like they were little wings. Stupid and frustrating to look at. Also, there was the constant offensive language and profanity. Why the need for all the racial and anti-LGBT language? Another horrible scene: when Alec Baldwin's character tells the other guy, \"You one of those guys who works out? Go f*ck yourself\". Yes, that's how bad the dialogue was. The script was unbearably bad. Also, the main female character of a psychiatrist? Why would she sleep with her client who acts like a total lunatic and is extremely insulting to her? Is this Scorsese's fantasy of women? You can treat them like crap and then they break their professional ethics to sleep with you? Horrible. I just watched Casino the night before and was on a Scorsese kick. Wow, what a comparison. Casino is about 100 times better than this one. I can't believe I thought this was a good movie when it first came out. What was I thinking? I guess if you are desperate enough to believe the hype, you can like just about anything. I guess that explains all the positive reviews here. Sad. Deeply painful movie to watch and not at all worth the 2.5 hours of my life I'll never get back. Don't waste your time watching unless you enjoy watching movies just to see how terrible they can get."

The plot was ok and the acting was mediocre at best as there was a lot of over-acting for dramatic effect which diminished the realism and believability. It felt like I wasn't watching fictional characters with any depth, instead just actors acting with bad fake Bahstun accents. I think this would have been a much better movie with some quality new or unknown actors instead of the typical multi-Millionaires, of course, that isn't how the movie business works - it's all about the money and the A-listers get more cattle to the box office. Finally, the cover of Pink Floyd's classic Comfortably Numb was absolutely terrible, I actually cringed when I heard this beautiful song being completely butchered. The band, singer, and anyone involved with this decision should be lined up against a wall and pelted with rotten cantaloupe until they sob, apologize, and promise to never do this again."

Now I saw this movie before I saw the original infernal affairs I saw infernal affairs about a year after an thought the original was much much MUCH better. This movie lacks proper character development and we feel no emotion for the characters. The only thing better about this remake is the mob boss played by Jack Nicholson.

Leonardo DiCaprios character wouldn't have survived any longer than the amount of time it took Jack Nicholson to find him after hearing that there was a rat in the group. Secondly, if there is a leak in a department, they would bring in from outside the group to investigate, not just tell the guy in charge to do it.

      "text": "While the original Hong Kong version was plausible due to their cultural standards, Scorsese's version was way below imaginable standards. While the HK verison had some plot devices, there was a lot implausible gaps and forced concepts that didn't work out in the American version. Like a boss sitting in the front of a car so the mole can communicate in the back. A gang boss will never sit in the front of a car! Using cell-phones to bring down a gang is just lame and un-inspiring! Colin Sullivan, who claimed to not be able to use the password on his computer all of a sudden uses it to delete Costigans profile on his very own computer seconds later. The list goes on and gets very tiresome to mention. Didn't anyone review these forced issues and plotholes before making the film? That's right, they just tried to copy IA, forgetting about the lost in translation consequences. Its a shame that America never bothered to release the IA trilogy instead in theaters. The original stories encompassed balanced story-telling, better suspense and emotional content, slick cat-and mouse chase, psychological dept, and well-developed and intriguing characters. We also get to see how being in the police and triads truly bring grief in their lives. The Departed was done sloppy in comparison only saved by typical Scorsese violence and swearing. The characters in Departed were lame and boring. Billy Costigan (Leo Dicpario) is the only character probably that got his role right. Matt Damon, a good actor, had a very dull and typical bad guy character in comparison to Andy Lau's tormented role in IA. Martin Sheen was a poor father figure and a watse of time. and of course, there are other lame, pointless filler characters that aren't worth mentioning. Sadly, Scorsese will get praises from the audience no matter how he makes his films. Had Scorsese's name not been on the director's list, this film would had got a worser rating. All in all, it was IA that was more realistic. People say Departed is, but tell yourself this, not one person swears that much, nor do you see bloodshed like that in reality. 4 guys getting bullets in their heads one after another? There was a reason why IA had the bullet in the head scenerio but Scorsese and Monahan just really never knew what it meant, did they?"

As usual Mark Walburg stole the show becuase his character was lovable but Damon really showed his prowess in creating a character of depth, with frailty and orginality. Unfortunatley brilliance on his part was dependent on Decaprio's reflection. The script was a little heavy handed and frankly seemed to try to be a little too hard in the final sequences to be a Tarintino movie.

At the end when everyone gets shot, I really didn't care too much about any of the characters' fates. Maybe it's the tabloid cast. We know so much about these people personally, it might as well be our parents or friends on screen. We know that DiCaprio gets up from the floor, cleans off the fake bullet hole in his head, and goes back to his perfect \"real\" life of fame and wealth. We weren't so certain about that back in 1992 with Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. We need to either stop with the tabloids or find new actors that will enable our suspension of disbelief again."
