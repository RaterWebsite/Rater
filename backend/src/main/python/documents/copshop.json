      "text": "Gerard Butler and Frank Grillo play outlaws on opposite sides: Grillo is a mob defector and Butler is the hitman assigned to rub him out. They end up in opposing cells in the same jail. Meanwhile, another assassin (Toby Huss providing some twisted humor) joins the race to dispatch the snitch. Meanwhile, the invasion of the police station gets lethal with the encounters boiling down to one cop (Alexis Louder taking an impressive lead). This film takes a while to get going, but once it does, there are some impressive scenes of violent action. Everyone in the cast seems to be enjoying the pulp aspects of the plot and style, which translates into an unusual conflict drama that escalates into an action film."

It's not just the acting it's there writing too. when they speak its feels as if they were added into the script for some reason."

      "text": "From the moment the opening credits and especially the title theme music (a direct homage to Lalo Shifren' s Magnum Force theme, the Dirty Harry sequel) started, Joe Carnahan' s love of pulpy '70s thrillers was apparent. Comparisons to John Carpenter's Assault On Precinct 19 are obvious given the siege atmosphere in a police station, and the trust between criminal and cop. It's as though he combined the old school '70s Don Siegel with the new school '70s of Walter Hill. Mean and lean, it's great that Carnahan directed this and the also enjoyably goofy Boss Level in the same year."

      "text": "Often stylish and with a fantastic cast, copshop uses smart direction and editing work to generate great thrills with some notable moments of action mixed in with the tense buildup to its finale. However within such an over saturated genre it fails to truly shine above the rest and yet it glistens nicely enough within the other gold tier of quality films of its ilk and kept me very entertained throughout."

I'm intrigued.Copshop doesn't really care about anything, but what it offers is a fun ride that really seems to admit that it is only made for what it has to last, and that should be enough for you, because if something became clear to me is that if you demand more, you are the one who is fooling yourself with your own expectations."

      "text": "(Mauro Lanari)So far, Carnahan's worst film. For the first time in his valid career, he mistreats his own directorial qualities by not bringing interesting novelties and limiting himself to yet another more violent, brutal and pulpy remake of \"Assault on Precinct 13\" (Carpenter 1976 ...). The greenhorns will barely remember the derivatives \"Reservoir Dogs\" (1992) and \"Free Fire\" (2016)."

It seems like a lot of action films nowadays are trying prove that action cinema can be art too, as if we didn't know that already. I love those movies, but sometimes it's fun to go back to pure and to-the-point 80's style action."

There is some groundwork for the second part, but it seems to me that it will only break the perception of the first and make it worse. However, if it does come out, I will definitely look at it."
