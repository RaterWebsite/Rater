      "text": "For a while, Walt Disney was considered the best animation studio winning over many fans who praised it for its way of adapting older stories and making them seem both nostalgic and fresh. Impressed by the success of its sibling studio \"Pixar\", Walt Disney decided to step in computer animation, which didn't work out that well for them at first. It wasn't until a couple of years ago that they managed to get their first critical and box office hit. From a number of great movies (Tangled, Wreck-it Ralph, Frozen, Big Hero 6, Zootopia) none of them has touched me as much as \"Moana\".\"Moana\" tells the story of a teenage girl of the same name, living with her parents in a beautiful island in ancient Polynesia. She's the daughter of the chief and she wants to travel far away from her home, which her father doesn't approve. She does it anyway and in her journey to save her people, she's joined by a silly chicken named HeiHei and the demigod Maui.The film has plenty of humor, heart, beautiful imagery and music and three dimensional characters. It's the best musical Disney has made in a while. It's full of twists that are effective and thought provoking. Moana is another flawless addition to the Disney Animation Canon and a must see."

Moana pretty much shows the same essence of previous works (wow, that's pretty obvious), visually gorgeous, charismatic characters, a cool story and full of adventures. As cool as Moana is, it's far from being a masterpiece or even above average, but I must agree to one thing, the songs from the Disney movies remain sensational."

Dont expect much in terms of plot or story telling, but like many other Disney musicals, the tunes are simple, catchy and all around fun to listen to. The story is about the future chief of a tribe that is suffering from impeding famine due to degrading natural resources. Apparently, this was happening because the goddess of nature lost her heart so the future chief gets on a boat and sets out to return the heart to the goddess. She is aided by the ocean gods (or whatever that entity is) and enlists the help of a demi-god (Maui) to help her. The story is not good. For instance, the ocean itself could have accomplished all the goals trivially if it wanted to but instead it got a weak human and a half god to do work which would have taken it literally, a few seconds to accomplish. But this is Disney, so you have to leave your brain at home. Overall the movie is fun hence the good score and kids will have a great time with the music and characters (my 2 year old loved it). I think its time for Disney to change Star Wars to a musical... whats left of it that is..."

Could't the ocean just defeat the lava monster, since it was unable to touch the water? If the ocean was able to make a pathway of water in the end scene, then why couldn't it help moana earlier?\" I realize that it would defeat the purpose of the ending part with the volcano being the goddess, but throughout the entire movie I kept thinking that the movie's entire conflict could have been solved very very easily, so what was the point of prolonging it for so long?"

      "text": "GOOD- The animation is competent, though none of the visuals are particularly groundbreaking or creative- Disney learned long ago that if you give the main character ENORMOUS expressive eyes and make them charmingly klutzy it's easy to make the audience like them. That more or less works here, but again, it's a very old formula by now and has become a crutch.- The coconut pirates were amusing.MEDIOCRE- The songs are just meh. They're superficially catchy (not hard to achieve) but lack emotional engagement. Nothing comes remotely close to classic showstoppers like \"Be Our Guest\" or \"A Whole New World\".- The Rock's performance as Maui is so-so, and I say that as a big fan of his. He's got a weird, offputting character design with beady little eyes, a caveman face, and no neck. Honestly he looked more like a villain than a hero.AWFUL- Moana is a huge Mary Sue and has no character arc (OK, she very briefly doubts herself, then instantly gets over it). She has no flaws to overcome and the only growth she experiences is learning to sail her boat. This is lazy, agenda-driven writing. You can't invest in a character if right out of the gate they're the smartest, bravest, free-spirited-est Chosen One of Prophecy and have no room to grow or lessons to learn. It's boring and reads like fanfiction.- Meanwhile the main male characters, Moana's dad and Maui, are stupid, insecure, and pretty much useless. If a kids' movie did this to all its female characters people would be shrieking and gnashing their teeth.- The themes are: 1) home and community and tradition are boring, so leave them all behind as soon as possible! 2) Kids should ignore their lame old parents and listen to their \"inner voice\" instead! Grown-ups just don't get it!3) Men screw everything up, and only women can fix their mistakes! Grrrl power!4) The source of all creation and life is actually a jolly green Gaia spirit! Screw Christianity, it doesn't have a soundtrack by Lin-Manuel Miranda!- There's something ugly about a multinational corporation like Disney employing a bunch of render-farm nerds in Burbank to make a movie that exploits indigenous peoples for the sake of commercialized faux-exoticism. Maybe Pacific Islanders don't need a bunch of American business executives to make movies about them and slap the IP on lunchboxes and t-shirts. Maybe doing that is just a little presumptuous, even if they let a few of them do some voice work as a fig leaf."

Moana is a CG animated film which takes place on a South Pacific island about a young girl named Moana, played by newcomer Auli\u2019i Cravalho, who longs to explore the ocean but is forbidden to leave as a result of her overprotective father who is also the Chief.  To make matters worse, Moana\u2019s Grandmother tells stories to the children of a demigod named Maui (played by Dwayne Johnson) who can change shape and experience wonders of the great sea which are all just out of reach from those stuck on the island.Moana features catchy songs and fantastic animation in addition to a well crafted story that feels both ancient and modern at the same time.  Moana and Maui have excellent chemistry on screen and both Cravalho and Johnson surprised us with their ability to convey humor, emotion and song with their voices.  We were glad to see a female protagonist introduced into the Disney universe who wasn\u2019t part of a love interest or even have a love interest at all \u2013 unless you count a love for her people and the ocean.  The movie also does a nice job of conveying Polynesian/Samoan culture and even has a couple of catchy songs sung in Traditional Tokelauan.Overall, Moana is enjoyable and fun to watch \u2013 if there was a negative side about the movie it would be that much time is spent with the two characters on a raft and reminded us a bit of the Kevin Costner movie Waterworld.  We would have liked to have seen a secondary plot that may have kept us involved for the rollercoaster ride and maybe even some explanation as to the significance of some of the cultural elements germane to the story."

The story was, frankly boring, and still managed to be difficult to follow for kids and the parents who, when asked, 'why did she do that?' had to say 'no idea'. Why did she keep falling in the water? Who knows? Was it supposed to be funny? Who knows?Moana's a pretty generic Disney princess heroine (despite the fact she is, to differentiate her from every other Disney princess heroine, only the daughter of a chief), full of moxie (as per usual Disney princess heroine) who must do something to save her island.. or learn something about herself.. or.. I'm not sure!The Rock is marginally amusing as the comic relief. He isn't helped by the dumb jokes he's given. The young actress voicing Moana does her best but isn't noteworthy (I think she was a non-professional and it shows.. or is heard).Lin-Manuel Miranda, who has done such a majestic job with Hamilton, hasn't done himself proud here. The songs just drag on. One song is the chirpy 'You're Welcome' sung by the Rock. It's catchy if nothing else.Frozen's a hard act for a Disney musical to follow, but Moana doesn't even try."

I laughed out loud 2-3 times, which is pretty rare for me seeing a movie, and had a big smile on my face for at least 1 hour and 30 minutes while in the remaining time tears!There is so much to talk about while reviewing this film not least of all is the imaginative animation from the colors used, the many different characters, the variations of the sea btu most of all the expressions of each of the characters whether talking or not.Dwayne Johnson, just voted the sexiest man alive, the highest paid actor in the movies and the star of the successful HBO series \"Ballers\" plays Maui and the drawing of his character, with animated tattoos all over his body, is fun in itself. Auli'i Cravalho debuts as Moana has a beautiful voice and plays the princess, though she insists she is not a princess as if that is a wrong thing to be. The banter, written by the screenwriter, Jared Bush, is not only fun but smart. Along with the two co-stars there is grandmother everyone would love to have voiced by Rachel House, the dumbest rooster you will ever see on the screen voiced by Alan Tudyk, Temuera Morrison as Moana's father, Jemaine Clement as a crab that has one of the many excellent songs, Nicole Scherzinger as Moana's mother, who is drawn too young looking more like her sister and my favorite, lovable creature, Puanani Cravalho as the pig!The songs are infectious, strong and one or two might show up as an Oscar nomination. They were written by Lin-Manuel Miranda, of \"Hamilton\" fame, Mark Mancina and Samoan Opetaia Tavita Foa'i.The drawings and the animation of the characters are mind boggling as are the scenes on the ocean and islands.Treat yourself, and take a kid along if you would be too embarrassed going into seeing a 'cartoon' .

      "text": "Faithful to the tradition of Disney\u2019s renaissance era, Moana takes audiences of all ages on a journey with a resourceful young woman who learns her place in the world. Parents will love the tribute toward Polynesian culture, while kids will love the fantastical journey made complete with a fresh color palette. Other than an inappropriately placed gag about urination, Moana has established itself as yet another family-friendly hit by the Disney studio within their CGI renaissance.The wide range of animation styles explored here starts with a two-dimensional storytelling of what Polynesian religion believes brought the islands into existence. In what appears to be a moving tapestry, a wise, grandmotherly voiceover tells us of Mother Island, who raised islands out of the sea and then rested among them. That is, until Maui the shapeshifting demigod stole her heart. Along his path away from Mother Island, he lost the heart, as well as his fish hook that allows him to shapeshift.Then the animation style switches to the traditional computer animation, where an elderly storyteller is speaking to her grandchildren about the story. The one seated in the middle of the pack, the heroine of our story, immediately goes out onto the seashore, where the miraculously animated living water leads her through conch shells to the heart of Mother Island itself: the ocean called her to restore peace to the land.Then this toddler grows up to become Moana, daughter of the chief who wishes to sway away from their traditional ways in order to explore the world. She\u2019s a typical kid\u2019s movie heroine we\u2019ve seen countless times before, and her motive to defy authority is not a good message for our kids, but the empowering musical voice by Auli'i Cravalho plenty makes up for that.Her grandmother pushes her to follow the calling by the ocean to find Maui the demigod so that she can help him retrieve his fish hook and return the heart to Mother Island. It follows out of the tradition followed by her people, as they are not voyagers; but their long-forgotten ancestry says otherwise. Therefore, Moana goes out on the quest, with a google-eyed, dim-witted chicken as her sole companion.Then she meets Maui himself, voiced with a lovable laid-back nature by Dwayne Johnson. He adds the familiar heart and soul expected from any Disney feature, as his tattoos move individually to express his true feelings.Now with the demigod on her voyage, Moana travels elsewhere to find his hook and get to Mother Island. Such stops include an underwater world of fantasy that houses a giant gold-crazy hermit crab. He is not one of the more tolerable portions of the adventure though, as his modes of dialogue includes rambling without a clear punchline to whatever joke he\u2019s attempting to deliver, and an out of place song sung in the style of Paul McCartney.This is among one of the other songs that simply sound odd in melody. Even so, there are several hits in the score, including Moana\u2019s single ballad, \u201cHow Far I'll Go,\u201d and the catchy \u201cWe Know the Way,\u201d both of which are guaranteed Oscar nominations. Yet none of these songs will catch on as one of Disney\u2019s iconic tunes. In addition, anytime the characters are not singing, they are blatantly telling us through not-so-subtle foreshadowing what will happen later on.Another thing that is difficult to grasp about Moana is the big \u201cso what\u201d of its celebration towards pagan religion. While yes, we should never be afraid to learn about other cultures and their backgrounds, depicting their gods as truth is not the answer to learning about who these people are. I would like for Disney to someday make a big leap in exploring and faithfully retelling the way those of another culture live their day to day lives, as to make up for their poor treatment of non-White races in the past.I cannot see Moana becoming a celebrated classic like Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, or The Little Mermaid, nor can I see it largely influencing pop culture like Frozen or Zootopia, but it is still a fresh adventure for the young and young at heart to get the ideal expected Disney experience."

How could they even come close to that?\" And then, my expectations are exceeded. Such is the case with Disney's 56th animated film \"Moana,\" which is a fantastic film with a fun story that, while not terribly original, is told well enough to make it feel fresh. On top of that, the characters are great, the music is catchy and memorable, the film is funny, exciting, and heartfelt, and the animation...oh boy, the animation. This is one of the most beautiful animated films I have seen, and watching it all in action just feels so, for lack of a better word, magical. There's no other way I can say it, go see \"Moana.\" And if you end up loving the film after reading this review, well, \"What can I say except, 'you're welcome?'\""

      "text": "Compared to other disney movies over the recent years Moana has the highest comedic value with punchlines and jokes around every corner. The animation is excellent; although for a disney movie this is to be expected. The songs are a big part of this movie and were sung beautifully. The core story-line of Moana is simple yet it is engaging. The underlying story, motivations and reasons however bring a lot of questions; especially when it is thought over after the movie ends. Moana is a great disney movie especially for those who watch it purely for enjoyment and laughs. However if one is looking for a well thought out story Moana lacks in comparison to recent disney movies such as Big Hero 6, Inside Out or Zootopia."

      "text": "Moana grabs from a culture ripe with unique stories and narratives to tell, but does completely nothing with it--which is frustrating. The film follows every device and mechanism layed out by every other movie prior to it and somehow plays with them with even more lethargy. It's painfully obvious and predictable. Personally, I wouldn't recommend it just to save the person from an hour and 53 minutes of unrewarding tedium"

      "text": "Moana is rich, colorful, lively, and full of spark. It is a good film, though it is not the best, most groundbreaking animated film. It's storytelling is generic with some slightly new twists. The music is good, but not heart wrenchingly powerful nor emotionally stirring. The animation is amazing, as expected. Moana herself is an endearing character, yet her story seems quite small and downplayed. However, it is Disney. It is, overall, a quality movie experience.P.S. I loved the chicken."

      "text": "Sorry little boys.  Another Disney movie means another Princess movie.  It seems that is all Disney makes anymore, but can you blame them?  \"Frozen\" made about a billion dollars world wide.  This latest Princess film follows the standard formula.  This time an Island Princess leaves home for an adventure (as opposed to leaving a castle, or tree top, etc).  The film looks great, has a few really good songs and a couple not so good, and some humor here and there (although not as funny as some other Princess films like \"Tangled\").  It even boasts the world's stupidest chicken, although that schtick got old pretty quickly.  Moana's traveling companion, Maui, is the standard issue annoying character who fights Moana every step of the way, until the end of course.  Despite the lack of originality it is a well made film and I enjoyed it.  Boys will have to wait for Disney's competition to come up with another \"How to Train Your Dragon\" or \"Kung Fu Panda\" sequel to appeal to them and fill the void left by Disney."
