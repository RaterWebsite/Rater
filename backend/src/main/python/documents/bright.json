It was never going to be a world beater or win an Oscar but what it does do is meld Will Smith's other buddy cop movies Bad Boys with Dungeons & Dragons.   Plenty of fun one liners, plenty of action and despite people trying their best to find some social commentary about the treatment of different races Bright is purely an action movie set in a fantasy world and newsflash to the reviewers out there fantasy worlds are often segregated.   If you are in to fantasy settings and movies like this then it's a fun way to spend 2 hours, if you are a stuck up movie critic then best you go watch Schindler's list again.   Even my wife liked Bright and she doesn't like anything."

Alien Nation buddy cop movie in an alternative present world with Tolkien-like fantasy elements. And it's entertaining as hell! I have a feeling maybe a lot of people have chosen not to like it because it's a Netflix-production and potentially might upset the balance (and $$$) in Hollywood, but Netflix makes content for users, not critics. This is the rare action movie I might actually watch more than once."

Did I have fun or not?I rarely expect high art when I'm going to watch a Will Smith movie so I didn't expect one going into this. Also I am factoring price into this as effectively I consider the price of a netflix subscription to be a sunk cost already so it's effectively free imo. So a good fun cop movie but with orcs, elves and magic. Some good jokes, yeah some of the action scenes were a bit weak but after having seen how bad the action sequences were in iron fist I can forgive a lot. I do admit to REALLY loving the police procedural/buddy cop movie genres though so I will forgive a lot. So I'd say on a quiet night during the holidays when you're zoning out after too big of a Christmas dinner this is a good enough distraction for a couple of hours."

I'm not sure where all the hate come from, I've had a lot of fun watching it, the plot isn't bad at all, the only problem would be the villains, who are a bit \"random\", without personality and just being evil without reason. Otherwise, the movie's pace is nice and it doesn't feel awkward to mix these very different universes. I hope there'll be more episodes !"

While many critics were too harsh on this film, I agree to some extent with the critiques on the bland scene framing and script writing. I also did not like the fast-paced sentimentality that tried too hard to appeal to pathos (no spoilers, ski-cap). Despite the mediocre aspects of the movie, I enjoyed watching it for fun. I wouldn't agree with my brother that this is one of the best movies of the year, but it doesn't deserve a zero. User sterge10 on metacritic commented that the movie, \"meld Will Smith's other buddy cop movies Bad Boys with Dungeons & Dragons.\" I think totally agree with him. This is one of the film's mighty orcish strengths, it's urban-fantasy uniqueness that people tend to find in comics, cartoons, video games, and tabletop roleplaying games. I'm glad such a genre is finding its way to, errrr, digital cinema through this movie. This unique, overly decent, and fun film should definitely have scored higher with the critics."

The story is interesting as it brings a lot of lore into the table. Maybe the acting is not perfect but it serves the plot perfectly. I like the wand stuff, as it is compared to a nuclear weapon. I like the racist side of the story with the Orcs and even the Elves...and all the tribulations that goes with it. The Fx are pretty good...Maybe the point where the movie fails is the motivation of the FBI of magic in all this. It's never really clear on which side they stand.

      "text": "First off, I want to say this movie is a 7 out of 10. Why did I rank it 10 then? To counter several other reviews I saw that gave it a 0 with two lines that explain nothing about why they don't like the movie. I would rank this movie an 8 out of 10, but the beginning of the movie is rocky; and the racism angle can be a bit heavy handed at times. I truly believe the critics giving this movie awful reviews went into this movie wanting it to fail miserably.Now what was wrong with the beginning? Well right off the bat we are shown Will Smith getting blasted by an orc with a shotgun point blank, but wakes up completely fine. And are later told that he is going back to work just a few days after getting shot. That blast plate must have been made of dragon scales to block a shotgun that close with nary a broken rib. Smith is then told by his wife to get rid of a fairy in the front yard; which is equivalent to a squirrel in our word. Smith then beats the **** out of the faerie with the quip \"faerie lives don't matter today!\" I feel like this joke set a bad tone as probably the first joke of the movie, but nonetheless wasn't as bad as some of the other critics have claimed. Smith then goes and gets his daughter ready to go to grandmas. His daughter asked her how his new partner, Jakoby, is going to work out since orcs are mean and bad. Smith tries to teach her about tolerance and that orcs are no different from you or me. However just then Jakoby pulls into Smith's yard. Smith goes out and absolutely lambastes Jakoby and is pretty racist to him, which is a far cry from what he told his daughter literally 30 seconds ago.At the station some of the most painful dialogue happens, as the other officers talk about how Smith is putting up with an orc partner that is just... painful to me. The other officers then do various other semi-racist things to Jakoby such as ask him if a mug shot of a sexual predator is his uncle, which is fine. But at one point they staple a literal \"Kick Me\" sign to Jakoby's back and the contrast between that and the earlier insult is a little strange. Besides that, my only other complaint is too many factions are introduced in such a short time. There are the Inferni, the Crooked Cops, Good Cops (really just one guy but still plays a major role), Magical Task Force, Shield of Light, The Orc Gang, The Hispanic Gang and then Smith/Jakoby/Tikka combo. That's eight different groups and if you cut one or two out and focused more on the others (especially the Inferni or Shield of Light) it would have improved the experience. Of course there are also sequels coming out so this is only a minor complaint.So what does this movie do right? It has some good comedy, the **** gunfight and hospital scene especially. The characters are also well done and relatable, if a little over the top at the time. Edgerton pulled off a very hard character to play very well. The plot armor of the last fight where Smith and Edgerton take on 3 highly trained assassins wasn't highly unbelievable, especially since they were part of a literal prohpecy. However, Smith did get absolutely beat up and shot throughout the course of the film, I have no idea how he was even standing during the final scenes. Edgerton got healed by Tikka though so he wasn't as bad. The action scenes themselves were pretty awesome, my favorite was the slow-motion cop traitor scene with Bastille playing. Although some were a little strange like when an entire swat squad forgot they had rifles and went hand to hand with one Inferni. Overall, I think this was a great movie and if you have Netflix I would definitely give it a shot."

The movie is set in modern times, but with a fantasy world overlaid on top of it. Giving it a feeling of Lord of the Rings in todays times. Which I can see being extremely difficult to pull off and the makers of Bright did it. They managed to give us a fantasy/modern world with good character building, explanations as to why things are the way they are, fun action scenes, great acting, believable political society issue and a well put together sci-fi.  Overall, Bright isn't the best movie of the year, but it sure the heck is far away from being the worst. I'm giving this movie a 10 out 10, because its innovative, it's fresh, it's original in a sense and it's bold.

By mixing up the Fantasy and Buddy-cop cliches they came up with something altogether different and highly entertaining. With originality and a far more interesting world than the redone Star Wars there is at least one movie to give you some decent holiday escapism. The only weak-point is Ayre's directing (far too much blue lighting and shadows) but the writing, acting and action all gel well. Here's hoping for a franchise or having this set up a ShadowRun movie. Marks another solid piece of evidence why sites like RT and Metacritic need to start billing User Score first."

Kudos to Netflix for trying something new.For starters, the movie gets major props for blending Tolkein-like creatures in a modern day big city -- a concept I'd never seen before. As such, there was a surprising amount of world-building that goes on which immerses you in this racial/class dynamic in between Elves, Humans and Orcs and the fallout of a magical war that happened prior to this movie taking place. The characters slowly explain the background plot to the audience in their dialogue with each other, giving you enough of a gist to follow along. There's still a lot more left to explained about this world, particularly the foreshadowing of an upcoming big bad, but it doesn't detract from the plot we see in front of us. If anything, it leaves me both satisfied and wanting more.The characters themselves are portrayed well, with Jakoby stealing the show hands down. Surprisingly, Will Smith's performance leaves more to be desired, but he doesn't necessarily hurt the story. Noomi Rapace was fierce and I found myself actually feeling tension when she and her posse came after our heroes.  All in all, I enjoyed Bright. I am definitely piqued by this realworld-Tolkein situation and I am eager to see more in the upcoming sequel."
