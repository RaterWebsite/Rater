You can practically see him sweat behind the screen like Jordan sweats in front of you, to grab your attention, and once you give it to him, he doesn't have anything new to say. It is old book testimony and in fact the film itself confesses it once, \"the history might repeat itself\" and unfortunately it does. The entire structure of the script is similar to the previous Drago chapter in Rocky series.The boxing matches, the songs, the routines, the mistakes, the family drama and rebirthing itself once again, all the antics installed in here is a seen-this-seen-that conflict and also the solution. It merely feels like an episode of a series, and neither is this the middle chapter where everything gets flipped, nor is this the grand season finale, no one's wiser after the dust settles. Still there is something gutsy about Jordan's looks that makes you want to stay in this fight till the last round.His work is more than admirable, primarily because along with all those hokum strategies, irrelevant slow motion shots and at times impressive tactics, he can also act. And that's very hard to find. He makes sure you are looking in his eyes when he is on screen. And he does what he couldn't do in the previous Creed chapter and that is to make you choose him over Stallone. On Stallone's defense, he doesn't have much to invest in this one. Reminiscing the repetitive melodrama of his personal life, Stallone is completely out of this ring. He is underused for the most part of it.The peak moment of the film does allow both of these heavyweight championship to play the higher cards. A genuinely moving showdown of Stallone and Jordan in the middle act does makes your heart pump faster. In that hospital room, where Jordan's idol has fallen in front of him, somewhat and somehow the film promises you to take this into newer territories with justified reasonings. But as soon as you raise your hopes high, it beats you down to the ground with a knockout punch. What was Coogler's head spinning punch in the previous installment, it is left out dry and numb by Caple Jr.Arguably, the execution isn't bad, it is weak at times, but it also has its moment, the real culprit though is the script, confined in its own bubble no one is ready to pop it out. Thompson, Rashad and Lundgren as the supporting cast isn't impressive enough to hold on to their own ground, they are handed over a stereotypical space to fill in. As far as the action is concerned, both Jordan and Munteanu has done a bravura of work, it is surely a more gritty fight than the previous one but then these are empty punches.

If I had to compare it to the earlier Rocky films, it feels the most like Rocky 2.  A movie that was more predictable and not as good as the original and was overly weighed down by clunky family drama that wasn't written particularly well and didn't advance the plot or add depth to the characters.  On top of that, this movie has what must be the tenth \"you can't take this fight, you can't win!\" speech given in a Rocky film, but it makes absolutely no sense.  The writer DID do a good job of giving Drago and his son more depth and motivation then any villain in the latter Rocky sequels, but it also has a fight in RUSSIA in 2018 and never mentions the political climate...and never really explains WHY it has to be in Russia since Drago is a contender looking to fight the champ and would have zero leverage to dictate his own terms.  Sly was GREAT in Creed.  He's kind of lost here.  And that's probably the writing, too.  It's like they have no idea what to do with him.  And for some reason he's still broke despite managing a super star boxer that I would assume exists in a world similar to the real world, where even a middle weight champ like Canelo Alvarez has sponsorship deals worth over $300 million.Overall, this is a clumsy film.

In this go-around, Adonis Creed takes on Viktor Drago, son of Russian boxer Ivan Drago, whom Rocky famously fought in Rocky IV in order to avenge Adonis' father and Rocky's friend Apollo Creed who was infamously killed by Ivan in the ring. The stakes are certainly higher in this film, as Creed fights for honor, his family, and justice for his late father. Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone also make for a great and inspiring duo once again. And like with many of the previous films, it does feel very derivative at times and borrows heavily from past films in the franchise, but that still doesn't even come close to stopping the film's infectious and inspirational energy, and if it's not enough to get you pumped, then I don't know what is!

That blinds us easily. It easily makes us think that something's just straight up not worth watching because it's \"not as good.\"But this thing was great. I like that it didn't forcefully introduce any new characters but instead just developed Creed, Bianca and Rocky more. Those are the characters I enjoy watching and there was more to learn about them so why not? Bianca has a small singing thing going for her and she sounded gooooooood. The only thing I was a bit indifferent on was the pregnancy ****. It happens immediately after they have sex after Creed proposes. Why does it always happen like that? Like they've been together for a while and only now she gets greganananant. Did they have sex for the first time? That whole thing was pretty pointless overall.While fine to watch, the story follows the same predictable formula. It's the same thing again; Creed wins a fight, takes another fight since he's overly confident and loses it and then you go through some mental ups and downs and get ready to fight the same dude again. Nothing groundbreaking is done here, but the directing is good so it's still enjoyable to watch. The training montages were great, the character moments felt genuine, and the camerawork was fun, albeit not as creative as in the first Creed. Bianca's small music subplot is used creatively during the last fight's entrance which I thought was very surprising and awesome. The soundtrack to the movie itself was great too. Rap, once again, by many artists that specifically made music for this film. I loved it.The antagonist or whatever the **** main boxing bad guy was pretty good too. Nothing too special but they took an old bad guy from the Rocky's who had cummed a son, and made the son some sort of killing machine. It was an interesting twist, but it's not like Creed was gonna lose anyway since the whole movie builds up to that last fight in the same way every Rocky movie does. But it was fine. Not the old bad guy though. The actor was bad. Also sometimes the fight scenes looked fake and the audience looked like two extras copy pasted to be an entire boxing audience.

Well directed, especially considering that this is the director's first big budget film.The best thing about the film is that it has something missing from the Rocky franchise after IV, a really good opponent.

It doesn't hurt that he is a mountain of a man. He's also the most sympathetic villain in the Rocky canon. Once I learned his history and motivations, I honestly didn't have it in me to root against him.The cast is great all across the board. Again, Sylvester Stallone has Rocky nailed down. Although Adonis Creed has his moments of bad decisions and lashing out in a jerky and immature manner, Michael B. Jordan does such a great job of expressing his vulnerability and raw emotion that you can't be upset at him. Although it is a small role, Russell Hornsby has an excellent scene as a pragmatic and opportunistic fight promoter. You kind of wish he was in more of this.

The cinematography does have some nice points, but really few and fine, but again, there isn't comparison to the first one.In the first film, and in other Rocky films, sometimes we had an opponent where he doesn't have much substence, it is just a strong and hard to beat dude, wich maybe what it is in Rocky 4 for example, and i found it very important to not be like that, when they made you care, almost equally to both sides, then this is a story that it is great, and, fortunately, this is what happens in here.The way that they built the whole Victor Drago sequences is really good, he isn't just a evil guy that wants his name on the top, it is way beyond that, his back story with his mother and father are strong and you can see that he is doing that for bigger reasons, to make his dad proud and for take back their lifes how they were before Ivan lost the fight for Rocky, and you can see that a lot of times, how Victor react to certain things in some moments are really touching, you wish him better and you unserstand him. Considering this, it gives a nice resume of how this movie reaches in our personal life, this movie is a lot about fatherhood. We have the Drago relationship, the kid trying to \"fix\" old things and making his dad proud. Adonis with his daughter, that gave him a lot of extra, gave him inspiration to go on and be better with his hardwork. And Stallone with his son, that he wants to speak with him, but it is afraid of getting into ans messing something up, so as with his father, that he still wants to make him proud and make the name giant, it is very well made. This is strong, father and son relationship is a strong thing, able to make you do things that you wouldn't believe, with the body and even more with the mind, and i think that the film represents this really well.There are two training sequences herre, the first isn't a big deal, there is a nice montage with a cool ending, but nothing very special or different. Now, the second one is amazing, they go all the way back into no training in technological places and going to nature, get into the desert and that whole sequence is so great, so inspiring, so strong, so painful and raw, they could do a different thing with different training sessions or even the same but in different ways that end up being fantastic.Ivan Drago character was really good, almost everything, since where and how he lives with his son and how he manages to do the training, you can see the necessity to win and get back what he used to have before the Rocky 4 fight. More to the end one thing happen and there you can see a big character transformation, was really emotional and really well done, wich also is in function of the very nice Dolph Lundgren job together with the Florian Munteanu job, they both had nice chemistry, we could totally see how Victor was struggling and trying to help his father to get back up in life and the end he have some really touching moments, they both.Another nice script moment is the one where Adonis and Bianca daughter was born, in determined moment a possible tense moment is happening and it is crucial for what is going on in the story, and the way that it is done, without even one dialogue, showing great acting by Michael B. Jordan and Tessa Thompson, it was so strong and so real, one of the best scenes in the whole film. Stallone is also great in this film, he is a lot like in the first one, but in here he does have a nice improvment in the fatherhood part also at the training one during the desert. There are some really nice dialogues in this film, some really deep and wise things said that can be used in your life. There are strong and provocative moments that worked just well with Ivan Drago. But at the same time there some that could have had better moments, like the first conversation between Rocky and Ivan, it was ok, but it could have been even stronger. Dialogues between Adonis and Bianca in this one also get much better, Bianca have way more to do in here and she helps a lot in the inspiring part.Creed 2 gets exactly where it should, it is not just a boxe movie, it is a movie that talks about life, about struggle, change, difficulties and how to get up and keep fighting, even when you fall, get up and keep there because it is worthy the hard work of something that you love. Talking a lot about parenthood, making others proud and having something more to keep you hardcore, this is what it is about and it is beautiful and inspiring."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Creed II.

What this film does great is actually make Ivan Drago human. We actually care a lot about what is going on with the Drago family and my only disappointment is that we didn't really get to see more of them.

Likewise it has some great boxing scenes but again it ain't as good as the first one which also had the amazing one shot fight scene.The film feels like Rocky II and Rocky III combined as it has Creed dealing with his new fame but also being challenged by a raw powerful boxer. The director manages to give more depth to the characters especially with these drama.The actors also all give a great performance as usual.Lets go over the negativesCreed II does not really change the Rocky formula and this film retreads a lot of the same grounds that was in the first Creed. It retreads the Rocky giving Creed the mantle again. It has Creed trying to live up to his father, again. It has Rocky and Creed drama, again. Additionally, Creed's motive doesn't always feel necessary or right but people just support him anyway. He wants revenge but doesn't even remember the fact that Rocky did that in Rocky IV?

Even in this movie when the big fight finished, there was a silent sequence while Rocky observed it from an old man point of view. This made it kind of a rehash. Let me put it this way: Back to the Future was the exciting original.

Jordan) is preparing for a championship bout, unaware that the Dragos have him in their sight.Thematically, legacy is a huge issue in Creed II, particularly as it relates to fathers and sons, examining the emotionally fraught terrain that can result when fathers try to live vicariously through their sons, and when sons must live with their father's failures.In relation to this, the depiction of the Dragos is especially interesting. In Rocky IV, Ivan was a cartoon villain. In Creed II, he's still relatively thin as a character, but Lundgren is given enough room to portray him as essentially broken, living on nothing but bitterness, resentment, and shame. One gets the impression that from the moment of his loss he's been waiting for this, seeing his son as nothing more than the delivery method of his vengeance. Ivan has raised Viktor in pure hate, teaching him that the only thing that matters is winning, but you can see in every move that Viktor makes he's far more concerned with earning his father's respect - winning as an end unto itself means relatively little to him. There's a lot of pathos in that, and both Lundgren and Munteanu act the hell out of it.The training montages also do something interesting in respect to Viktor. Showing him jogging through economically impoverished communities, stacking crates, lugging around bags of cement, and working with less than state-of-the-art equipment, the parallel is not to Ivan, who trained with hi-tech gizmos and gadgets in Rocky IV, but to Rocky's training in the original Rocky (1976). Indeed, whilst Adonis lives in a luxury apartment, Viktor and Ivan live in a dingy bedsit in Ukraine that recalls Rocky's original digs in Philadelphia.The problem with all of this is that the Dragos' story is by far the most compelling one in the film. Set against the complex and fascinating Drago family drama, Creed's story is pretty insipid. And this feeds into the film's most egregious problems - its rigid adhesion to the Rocky template, and the concomitant predictability. Chances are that everything you think might happen in Creed II does, as the film makes no attempt whatsoever to be original. Aside from the Drago subplot, there is nothing here that we haven't seen before. Granted, the Rocky franchise has always tended to wear its predictability like a badge of honour, and the core template does work. But even when a film adheres to that template, one shouldn't be able to predict each narrative beat with near perfect accuracy. Even Rocky V, as awful as it was, tried something new. It didn't even remotely work, but the thinking behind it was admirable. Aside from two unexpected cameos, Creed II never once caught me off-guard, and because of that it's is interminably boring at times.Even the boxing itself is not especially well-done. Kramer Morgenthau's cinematography is fine, but nothing special, and pales in comparison to Maryse Alberti's work in the first film. Aside from Raging Bull (1980) and Ali (2001), both visually unique in their own ways, Creed is arguably the most technically proficient boxing movie in terms of in-ring competition. Creed II, however, shoots all the fights conventionally, holding a fairly uniform three-quarters distance from the actors, with Caple Jr.'s only trick seeming to be slow-motion, which he grossly over-uses.Although there are some laudable elements here, Creed II is a disappointment. Sure, the Rocky melodrama is there, the Rocky fights are there, the Stallone one-liners are there, but with a narrative focused almost entirely on the less interesting characters, this is a missed opportunity. Apart from the Drago subplot, everything is by-the-numbers. Yes, we care about these characters, but that's because of the previous films, and whereas Creed forged a path very much its own, Creed II returns to the overly familiar."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "let me first start with telling you that this is a good sequel.
