The article wasn't particularly good - it forgot about Better Davis's \"fasten your seatbelt, it's gonna be a bumpy ride\" and so on. But it got me thinking. And what popped into my mind (forgive me) were two lines from The Fifth Element that I found unforgettable:  \"Negative, I am a meat popsicle.\" and \"Does anyone else want to negotiate?\" And then there is the memorable \"It sa, it sa, it sa...\"  I am really curious what it is that so turned the critics off. I am a fan for life of this whimsical, silly, funny, well-acted and yes, sentimental, film. Love might not save the world, but wait - it's on again this week! Who cares!?!"

This is the ultimate Sci-Fi movie that stay very true to that concept. Everything is just so over the top that its a marvel to watch, almost like witching Scorsese on LSD. Also one little detail that many people don't notice that almost never happens any movie I have ever watched, is that the main hero (Willis) and the main villain (Oldman) never meet throughout the whole film. Not a big thing, but a curious one. Overall: a great Sci-fi romp that just never fails to entertain me. I absolutely love it!"

It didn't try to be something it wasn't. It's a movie about saving the world and it owned that. A sphere of pure power and evil is coming to destroy earth and only the four elements, earth, wind, fire, and water, (powers confined in sacred stones) combined with the fifth element or supreme being can stop it. The back story to the plot and the overall delivery this movie has stands as one of the most unique views on the future I've ever seen. No one will be able to do it like this one. There was a quirkiness that every single character had and it all fit into the mold perfectly. Gary Oldman sharp as always. A good balance between action and humor without losing the emotional and dramatic tone. Solid movie. It didn't get a 10 because I felt like the love interest between Korbin and Leeloo was lacking in development and since that plays such a major role, I felt that could have been focused on a little closer, maybe an extra scene or two of them bonding and what not...but an all-time favorite for me and worth a watch."

Luc Beeson has directed other films that are great (The Professional for example), but this is his best in my opinion. It has all of the best elements of an enjoyable film. Great characters played by great actors, a superbly funny sci-fi script, great set designs and special effects, and action that moves along briskly making the film seem almost too short. This is one of the few films that I have to watch whenever it's on TV. \"Multi-pass.\" Four ancient elements are hidden on earth to protect them. A fifth element is kept elsewhere to protect it separately from the other elements. Together they have the power to save the universe from Ultimate Evil which is heading to earth to get the 4 elements and annihilate the planet. Only one man, Corbin Geiss (Bruce Willis) can save the universe, and Zorg (Gary Oldman) is his nemesis trying to get the 4 elements for himself, on behalf of Ultimate Evil. Enjoy a really different sci-fi experience in this wildly creative movie!"

I adored the concept and the story even with the lack of flow never failed to intrigue.The script and satire are fun and slick, the visuals are breathtaking and unusual especially the amazing Big Apple effects with honourable mention to the camp trip to the resort planet Fhoston Paradise and there are plenty of thrills and imagination in the atmosphere to be had.Besson's direction is excellent, Eric Serra's music is atmospheric and jaunty and the characters are fun. As is the acting, Bruce Willis is charismatic, Milla Jovovich is beautiful and Gary Oldman is the personification of haute-couture corruption. In conclusion, a great sci-fi fantasy. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

Gary Oldman, Bruce Willis, Milla Jovovich all clearly enjoyed working with Luc Besson along with Chris Rock who has to be commended for wearing those, umm outfits and hairstyles which alone were worth laughs. This is two hours of fun which is not to be taken seriously and is clearly meant to be family fun. Perhaps the other film critics who felt the need to moan at this creative fun should take their brain out of the fridge or maybe actually stop being tight and go and see the film they have written about. This is unlikely as that would actually mean film critics earning their salary!"

      "text": "The Fifth Element is a delight from beginning to end not just because it is one of the most visually adventurous films of all time but because it encapsulates everything that great cinema should be, and that is moving, clever and most of all fun. The film tells the story of Corben Dallas (Bruce Willis) a taxi driver in the 23rd century who used to be a secret agent. He is recruited to complete another mission, this time to save the world from an extremely powerful entity heading for earth. To do so he needs the help of Leeloo (Milla Jovovich), a mysterious woman who speaks an ancient language and can eat an insane amount of roast chicken. He is also assisted by an old priest (Ian Holm) and an inconsiderate shock jock (Chris Tucker). The film has a wicked sense of humour thanks to a great script which keeps the film trundling along at an exhilarating pace while never making the film hard to follow. The script (co-written by Luc Besson) not only emphasises the themes of the film but also sticks them in your mind so that by the end you have a plethora of lasting thoughts and emotions. As stated about, despite the films depth and pace it is never hard to watch. In fact its one of the easiest viewing experiences because the film works on so many levels. From a light hearted actioner to a serious commentary on love and religion the film just works. The direction by Luc Besson is flawless as the action sequences have a perfect fluidity to them. The finest part of the film however is the score which is unconventional yet incredibly powerful with the finale being a perfect example of how well it works. The depiction of the future is peculiar but stunning at the same time thanks to some inventive cityscapes (thanks to some impressive CGI that still holds up 15 years later), intriguing aliens, intriguing new technologies and most of all the costumes (by Jean-Paul Gaultier). The costumes capture the tone of this wondrous new world perfectly while still maintaining a sense of reality (nothing beats a good suit, even 200 years in the future). The film still delves into the idea of the future as dystopia but it never feels heavy handed as the film concentrates on the action most of all. The fact that Besson does his up most to ensure the movie is fun, ensures that it is, with the cast always looking like they are having the time of their lives. Speaking of the cast there are some standout performances with both Jovovich and Willis being great leads. In fact it is most likely Jovovich\u00e2"

I recently got it on DVD, and was worried that it wouldn't live up to my exalted memories, but no worries, this movie has withstood the test of time! Which is pretty amazing for a sci-fi flick - one might expect outdated effects to weigh it down, but this is not a problem at all. I'm not clever enough to explain just what makes this movie so amazingly wonderful, but it's got it all - plot, action, humor, imagination, music, sex appeal! It's nothing less than a feast for the senses! There is a scene that jumps back and forth between a fight and an alien opera performance that just has me smiling all way through. Just PERFECT! And if you've seen this movie, you know what PERFECT means. ;-) And one more thing: Jean Paul Gaultier was obviously born to design the wardrobe for this movie. His wacky clothes fit the bill perfectly, even though they would be completely out-of-place anywhere else! If you haven't seen this movie yet, I humble suggest you do so at the earliest opportunity."

      "text": "The Fifth Element. 10 out of 10; I was all prepared for my rant. I was going to rail against the fact that The Fifth Element was not available on 4k HD Blu-Ray. After all what other movies could you possible use to show off your new Oled 4k HDR tv with your 4k Blu Ray player purring alongside it? Okay yes La La Land is impressive and yes Dr. Strange is a good choice certainly but The Fifth Element is the classic film to show off one's new HD goodness. It truly is a visual treat. You have the film's visual style from Jean Giraud and Jean-Claude M\u00e9zi\u00e8res mixed with the costumes designed by Jean Paul Gaultier. Well, first I was going to list all the horrible films that are on 4k Blu-ray while this one isn\u2019t. Turns out however those actual movies on the new format are few and far between. Then I saw it, The Fifth Element was coming out on the format in July to celebrate its 20th anniversary. Yay. Truly everything about this film is fun. Even the stuff you really didn\u2019t like the first few viewings (I\u2019m looking your way Chris Tucker) seems to grow on you. The only strange thing that somehow still works but is jarring every viewing is the ridiculous over the top product placement for McDonalds. I swear The Founder had less golden arches. Some might also object to the rampant sexism, Tiny Lister\u2019s acting, Luke Perry\u2019s acting, and the general way the plot sometimes seems to play out. The Fifth Element has many layers that are not apparent at first. As an example, the good guy and the bad guy not just never meet in the film but are completely unaware of each other\u2019s existence.  Here is the kicker. I have watched the movie multiple times and only realized this because I read the trivia section of IMDB. The movie has a lot of depth for such a silly film and holds up extremely well.  Definitely worth the watch a true classic."

Problem solved.\r What's it all about?\rSet in the future, Bruce Willis stars as a taxi driver (of the flying variety, naturally) accidentally caught up in an almost farcical battle to save the Earth from evil. Faced with a thousand year old prophecy coming true, Korben Dallas (Willis) helps scared and almost-nude alien Milla Jovovich defend Earth by racing evil magnate Gary Oldman in the search for four prophetical elements.\r Should you watch it?\rDon't let the premise put you off. Yes it's surreal and almost ridiculous but Luc Besson's near fantastical sci-fi adventure is an enjoyable ride with bags of style to spare. Production design was handled by a pair of French comic book creators and costumes were designed by Jean Paul Gaultier.\r Willis and Jovovich are instantly likeable as the leads, Oldman plays the wonderfully over the top enemy and Chris Tucker injects another dose of craziness every time he appears as the extravagant motor-mouth radio host Ruby Rhod. Besson creates some great scenes, visually, Leeloo (Jovovich) going out onto a window ledge and giving the audience their first view of the futuristic city and musically, the Diva's opera edited together with an action sequence.\r Enjoyable and amusing sci-fi romp with a great cast."

      "text": "The Fifth Element is one of those films that just strikes a chord with me. Luc Besson's as-always stylish and energetic direction, his wacky and colourful vision of the future, and the plethora of weird and wonderful characters we spend time with over the course of the narrative all make it a very rewarding viewing experience. Bruce Willis' Korben Dallas is basically John McClaine dressed by Jean-Paul Gaultier, but still makes a very entertaining, relatable protagonist. Milla Jovovich is as her very best as the ass-kicking \"supreme being\" Leeloo, evolving from childlike innocence early on in the film to face her destiny as a weapon against evil. It's the relationship between Leeloo and Korbin that gives the film its emotional heart, and thankfully Jovovich and Willis get it spot-on. Gary Oldman's Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg is a great villain even by his standards, and among the best performances of his career (only just pipped to the post by another villain, corrupt cop Stansfield in another Besson film, Leon, and his recent scene-stealing performance as George Smiley in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy) - the limping, flamboyantly dressed arms dealer and tycoon is comic and scary in equal measure, and Oldman appears to relish the role. Ian Holm is also good as Vito Cornelius, a priest and guardian of the secret of the five elements (and the antithesis of Zorg in characterisation terms), and Chris Tucker provides much of the film's comic relief as the camp, ego-centric celebrity DJ Ruby Rhod. I've no idea why Luke Perry gets top billing in the credits - his character, an archaeology assistant named Billy is only in the film for about five minutes - even Lee Evans is in the film for longer, and he's only got three or four lines! Longtime Besson collaborator Eric Serra provides a brilliantly catchy electronica-based sci-fi score that is nearly as bonkers as the film's story. While the film is extremely enjoyable, there are a few plot holes, and a couple of ideas that are a little underdeveloped or that don't quite work. That said, The Fifth Element still has a lot to offer - it's a sci-fi-fantasy thrill-ride with great character performances, strikingly creative production design, great effects (especially for a European film), an abundance of good gags and some very entertaining set-pieces. If it weren't for the stunning Leon, this would be Besson's best film."

Even better, it has a great message about violence and evil and how evil begets evil. This is truly where The Fifth Element's success largely comes from, though the performances of Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich are both very, very good. The special effects are pretty cool and slick, as is the script and the direction from Luc Besson. Even better, the world it created is a fun and very expansive one that would be great to see more of. However, what I believe holds this one back a bit is the bad villain. Not only are there many of them, but Gary Oldman's motivations are never fully explained. His character is poorly developed and this really harms the overall film. However, that being said, The Fifth Element is a fantastic time and a very well done science fiction action film that is endlessly watchable."

It is a movie I truly liked even after many rewatches but it strangely also misses to win me over completely (Clarification: Difference between 8/10 to a 10/10). More strangely many people agree as it was nominated for positive and negative awards at the same time. I enjoyed the worldbuilding, characters, humor, ideas and story in general. Much harder is to pinpoint what I did not like or better said prevented a better rating. After putting some thought into this I will say it takes a bit too long at the start and misses to reach the level of the best movies in the science fiction genre (To be fair I even have a guilty conscience to write this). Story: After a set up in 1914 we jump to the year 2263 where our protagonist Korben Dallas who works as (flying) cab driver and gets in the adventure of a lifetime when the women Leeloo falls into his life;-). Meanwhile the ultra rich Jean Baptiste Emanuel Zorg makes a deal with a shady figure to gain even more power. All of this is linked to an ancient story. Here I will stop because of spoilers. The story is like I already said excellent popcorn material. When the slower start is over it has a great mixture of action, humor, character (interactions) within the entertaining story. Worldbuilding: I like the universe it creates. It feels like something that could be as the technology has evolved but mankind has still the same problems or struggles. The special and practical effects work well and enhance the experience. I never doubted anything in the movie. Characters: The whole cast did a great job and you can see how much fun they had. I read an article that they had so much takes they could not use because of laughing. Lets start with Bruce Willis as Korben Dallas. He gives a really good performance and is enjoyable.  Milla Jovovich as Leeloo impressed me even more. Back then she was not that famous and her performance made her widely know and impressed many including me. Today she was the star in many films and is a quite well regarded action film heroine. Also truly enjoyable is Gary Oldman as Jean Baptiste Emanuel Zorg. He is such a good villain and has memorable scenes like for example his weapon presentation. One of my favorite villains of that time and would be also fitting in a James Bond movie. Then there is Chris Tucker as Ruby Rod. Truly great comedy performance that enhance the cast. Lastly I want to praise Maiwenn Le Besco as (Diva) Plavalaguna. Has only a smaller role but her performance transcended the movie and is even today well known. A truly good overall performance. Visuals / soundtrack: The movie is visually impressing. You can clearly see director Luc Bessons vision and ideas. Like I already said it was always believable and look amazing. The soundtrack is excellent too. It uses a lot of orchestral music and is worth owning. Like said above too the opera music has transcended the medium and countless covers / homages are existing. Overall it is the kind of movie that I rewatch once in a while and will praise on one hand but it will never appear on my top 10 list or rated higher. It is however a must see at least for its style, ideas and some excellent scenes."

At first it has its grace, but then it becomes too embarrassing."

      "text": "Chris Tucker flamboyant character is insufferably annoying, completely useless, and once it appeared on the screen, it hindered the flow of the narrative and hampered the plot, which is, by the way, is flawed; it suffers from fast pacing at the beginning, and gradual decline of plausibility that leads to a cut-rate kid's movie ending.Nevertheless, most of the above-mentioned issues didn't bother me at all. Actually the movie exceeds my expectations. It's a thoroughly gleeful sci-fi/action romp brimming with creativity; marvellous inventive visuals, distinctive style and idiosyncratic tone, and splendid and utterly unique world-building.The characters are quite relatable, and well-developed and have some reasonable depth into them, especially Leeloo, who brought to life by Milla Jovovich. Bruce Willis showed his solid action chops and plenty of stamina and charisma to make Korben Dallas a quite likable hero. Gary Oldman plays the villain of the movie, Zorg, and I think that his fantastic over-the top performance is more than enough to elevate his rather uneven character that was hindered by the decline of the plot's cleverness.The movie also has an awesome utilization of its electrifying soundtrack in the action sequences, which are pretty cool!The Fifth Element is a helluva fun time; but that doesn't necessarily mean it's dumb at all. In fact the movie has some surprisingly deep moments that work pretty well despite the fact that Luc Besson never wanted us to take his movie seriously. I can see now why many fans hated Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets!(8/10)"

      "text": "This is a mix of fantasy and sci-fi, with some comedy elements. The characters are pretty hyperactive, the settings interesting and with some fairly good visual effects for the time the film was made (the late 90s) (it undoubtedly looks a bit dated now but it is over 20 years old, so that's to be expected), this is an enjoyable film, even though it's not perfect. The plot is a little thin perhaps but it's still quite entertaining. It has very much a comic book or graphic novel, type feel to it. The bad guys are typically over the top in terms of their performance but that's not entirely a bad thing. I can't say I fully followed all that was going on but I did find it pretty engrossing, in terms of seeing what was going on with various characters and the surroundings in scenes. Yes, I'd recommend this."
