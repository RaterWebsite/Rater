The film soon challenges whether it is Zu or Music who has a better view of the world, and that love, trust, and being able to be there for each other is everything.",

Now, play all of these downsides out to their extent and you get \"Music,\" a film that's not only hopelessly empty and trite, but apt to cause real-life harm. Like, demonstrably. I won't even get into the controversies at hand because they're honestly infuriating, with implications that can get dark pretty fast, so I'll just leave you all with this; there's a scene in here where Sia appears as a fictionalized version of herself, promoting a practice involving her smuggling medicine to third-world countries. I owe you an apology, M. Night Shyamalan in \"Lady In The Water\" - THIS is the most self-absorbed **** I've ever seen. With music-video-like breaks in narrativity that make absolutely no sense and some profoundly cringe-worthy dialogue, \"Music\" has to be one of the most tone-deaf attempts at handling a concept with such sensitive subject matter that I've ever seen in the big leagues."

It is a great pity that they do not know how to appreciate her as it should be. In a few years this movie will become a cult movie.And the only thing that will be frowned upon will be the people who did not know how to appreciate it."

La representaci\u00f3n del autismo se considera inexacta y peligrosa debido, en parte, a una escena en la que se realiza una t\u00e9cnica de restricci\u00f3n en MUSIC(personaje). Todas estas cr\u00edticas ponen en tela de juicio el libre albedr\u00edo de la directora, que sin embargo deber\u00eda tener plena libertad de elecci\u00f3n de sus actores o actores, y del contenido de las escenas de su propia pel\u00edcula.La cantante/directora Sia se disculpo y ahora da soluci\u00f3n a los conflictos que pudo causar su pel\u00edcula. Como acertadamente apunta la directora, su pel\u00edcula \"no es un documental sino una ficci\u00f3n\".   Es buena la iniciativa, su idea de no hacer una generalizaci\u00f3n de los autistas sino de ilustrar a los llamados autistas no verbales."

      "text": "Sia's Music is a wonderful and heartwarming movie! The issues that a young child experiences through a big case of autism are described and displayed very well! This is enhanced by the metaphors shown in the perfectly timed and well executed in-between music videoclips that play during important plot points. Not only are some of those clips colorful and playful, but they also are great as separate pop singles.    To further add to this, drug addiction, alcoholism, family problems, bullying and psychological issues are also being mentioned and incorporated in a realistic way to also heighten the film's awareness messages that is providing. A realistic story with its ups and downs is being told that can happen in any neighborhood nowadays.    I wanted to also touch the controversy that has been going around this film regarding a non-autistic person playing an autistic one (Maddie). To my mind her performance was great and passionate! Working with Sia all these years, she was perfect and already experienced for the dance routines performed in the in-between music clips. In addition, you could see the pain that a girl with such a problem can have in a somewhat of an extreme case. These extreme cases are plentiful in the real world. People and their families suffer from trying to cope and cooperate taking care of such children. Keep in mind that they are some of the most love educing children/people that you can find, despite having such a disorder!    I know there are autistic actors that could have been casted for this. In the role of this specific case of somewhat of an extreme autistic disorder it would have been a difficult time for the child itself. Imagine bringing to the film such a case of an autistic child. That child could have reacted in the painful way on-screen that could affect her mentally for some of the subjects raised in the film in the future. These children need special treatment constantly (as the film itself shows) and some of them are not given that! This film raises some awareness for this and hopefully it will touch a lot of people.In summary:+ Great and realistic story with its cheerful and sad moments+ Excellent acting from all three main actors! Maddie, Kate and Leslie+ Catchy and colorful pop songs+ Nice work from the supporting cast+ May raise some awareness about a lot of issues in our societyI am giving this film a 10/10 based on my overall review and since it's one of the few cases that these issues are raised in such a magical and musical way!"
