Even as a member of the LGBTQ+ community,  I can see the pandering. The movie's climax is, unfortunately, anticlimactic and obvious with each character getting their 'power spotlight'. The character of Cecilia Reyes is horribly destroyed in the film given that she's a dedicated medical professional in the comics (i.e. Do no harm).Overall a good watch, but glad it won't be part of ongoing efforts."

      "text": "The New Mutants is a film directed Josh Boone and is about Danielle Moonstar played by Blu Hunt who wakes up after an incident to find she is in a \"hospital\" for mutants. This will most likely be the last X-men related project to have the 20th century logo. The X-men happen to be my favorite superhero team so I always have high hopes for any film remotely related to them. However this is a minor disappointment. The concept of blending superheros with horror though interesting is executed terribly. The first half of the film just drags its feat so you end up wondering when something is going to happen. Add that to the fact that the characters are written in such away that they all feel cliche, yet the actors do portray there respective characters well, especially Maisie Williams who played Rahne Sinclair and Anya Taylor-joy who played Illyana Rasputin. However, good acting wasn't enough to save this film. In conclusion unless you are a hard core X-men fan who needs a movie fix than stay far away from this film."

Good, but forgettable.They were able to restart everything in a better way with the ambitious Days of Future Past, because that film's ending was pretty much a reboot but, no, Fox **** it up again and they chose to deliver the terrible X-Men: Apocalypse and then it became quite evident that the franchise was dying and it was dying in a very ugly way.Logan gave a satisfactory conclusion to the character, but let's be honest, that Wolverine was very, very far away from being the Wolverine that we deserved.X-Men Dark Phoenix was the last nail in the franchise's coffin and I say this because New Mutants, even after its brutal delays, is nothing more than the leftovers of the rotting corpse.I don't know what kind of story they tried to tell here but it's quite easily to see that the narrative approach never fits these characters.I know they were trying to separate this film from what the others of the franchise did but it doesn't work.I admire they tried because it's an example that you can try different stories with characters from comic books but you also have to know how to do things right and do some justice to the characters.It's no surprise that the only person who leaves an impression is Anya Taylor-Joy, maybe this job will get her a better future character in the MCU or maybe in DC, but she could definitely be in a better film.From what remains, I can only say that this is finally the farewell for the mutants at this stage of their life on the big screen.What's in store for them in the MCU? I can only hope for better stories."

Hopefully this won't be the last time we see this acted play Magik. She was really good. The other characters were portrayed fine, but Magik was the standout.Now that all the good stuff is out of the way, I can't help feeling that the story was just not worthwhile. Having the whole thing revolve around one character's manifestations got boring. I could not help thinking that the story would have been better had the focus been on the characters working through their differences and eventually coming together to figure out that they are being groomed not for the x-men, but some other evil purpose. Then battling that entity.  This was set up and is part of the movie of course, but the story never explains who was holding them, who was pulling the strings and why. It just gets brushed aside. Could have made an excellent tie-in to the larger franchise if they did it correctly."

Unfortunately, every other attempt you've made at marrying these two genres together has proven to be pretty disastrous, and this latest effort is no exception.To be fair, The New Mutants does have a GREAT premise. Take a bunch of teenagers struggling with the unfortunate consequences of their newly awoken powers, lock them in a psychiatric facility with a doctor operating under the guise of wanting to \"help them,\" and then give one of them the ability to literally bring all of their fears to life. It's an borderline brilliant idea, but the execution is so awful that only occasional and very brief flashes of the excellence that otherwise could have been ever show through. The lead actress can't act, its most interesting character (Magik) is underdeveloped, and the way it transitions from serious moments to ones where the cast are behaving like you would expect a bunch of horny, damaged pubescents to out of nowhere leads to a lack of tonal cohesion between a lot of the scenes. It has all the right elements to be the perfect millennial/Gen Z cape-and-costume flick, but never gives any of them enough room to breathe causing to whole thing to feel more like a janky pilot for another inevitably disappointing CW show rather than a well-executed proof of concept.Case in point, these teens have some of the coolest powers I've seen in a comic book adaptation since Bloodshot, but they don't really get to use them outside of the admittedly exciting final battle. Each character is compelling and seemingly layered in their own unique ways, but aren't explored much beyond the surface level. The plot also ultimately ends up going nowhere as it saves the major developments and inevitable showdown with the real big baddies for a sequel that we now know doesn't have a chance of getting made. I enjoyed this movie the most when it was trying to scare me. It's actually quite effectively creepy at certain points. Things like the smiley face men made my skin crawl showing that Josh Boone could have some potential as a horror filmmaker should he decide to go further in that direction at some point in the future. Which makes his upcoming remake of Stephen King's The Stand have some appeal to me whereas it otherwise didn't. However, given how strongly Magik's backstory ties into this side of things it only makes the fact that they sidelined it all the more frustrating.Like Spawn, Venom, and so many others before it, the final entry in Fox's X-Men universe is a misfire. Largely because it squanders so many of its most promising aspects more than anything. I can't think of another film I've seen that fails to capitalize on or sometimes even recognize its greatest strengths in the same way this one does. Which made me walk out of that theater feeling like I had seen where things could have gone right and ultimately disappointed with what we got instead."

Young mutants are haunted/harassed by something in a mental hospital. The best parts are pulled from the X-men series in which mutants first find out their powers, typically represented effectively on screen. Most times these scenes are fun, but the special effects are a mixed bag, jumping back and forth from decent to cheesy. Most of the ensemble cast are relatively new up-and-coming stars such as Maise Williams (\"Game of Thrones\"), Anya Taylor-Joy (\"The Witch/Queen's Gambit\"), and Charlie Heaton (\"Stranger Things\") but the acting is mediocre, and worst of all, they butcher whatever accent they are supposed to have (Irish, Russian[?], and U.S. southern respectively). And the story -- disappointing to say the least. If you drop your expectations to a bad 90 minute \"Buffy the Vampire\" episode, then maybe you'll find something to like."

It began with a quote we'e heard 1000x before beginning with Sitting Bull & most recently with Tomorrowland...and Idc if you replace wolf with a bear or not its still just as Cringey...in fact 100x more so... Then it just progressed into pure teen agnst nonsense & terrible CGI & effects. Ended with a lackluster & totally anticlimactic ending. Good God. This was JUST AWFUL. Maybe it it was the Online Streaming super hero shoes like Titans or Umrella Academy or Runaways that made me expect more from this but this was bar none the worst super hero movie or series Ive ever seen. Yes I am including the original 1994 Fantasic Four."

I have the unlimited pass so this movie didn't cost anything and I'm still upset for wasting my time. The plot was bad, the dialouge was boring and by the end of it I was cheering for the bear to just eat everyone."

Like they was rushing during the pandemic to throw something together and that's exactly what they did. Mfs was on a budget cut making this one. I could go on and on but imma just leave it alone."

Very dissapointing."
