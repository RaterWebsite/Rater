This is such an accomplished film from Norwegian film makers Joachim Trier and Eskil Vogt.A film which gives clues of what it is with Thelma.

Great acting from the leads.  Cinematography and mood were beautiful."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This is interesting one. Because the I saw the movie I saw passion, love, pain, superpowers, sadness and every other emotion. But after the movie I don't know how much of these emotions stayed with me or should I say for how long. But anyways I really did enjoyed this movie from the start till the end."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "More than an updating of Carrie, this one is a psychological thriller about the fear of God\u00b4s punishment, the repressed daydreams and the misfitting.

An unexpected but well-received surprise."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Thelma opens strong, builds well and then fails to deliver at it's climax. The story delivers best when it focuses on Thelma's psychological uncertainty. We're left feeling abandoned or underwhelmed at the end when the movie explains things we don't care about and leaves questions unanswered that the audience has been asking the whole time. The movie is worth seeing for the first 2/3."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "One of the movies of 2017.A film where everything seems understated but put it all together and you get this fantastic, moody, stylish thriller ."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "D\u00e8s les premi\u00e8res minutes, on sent qu\u2019on va se faire chier\u2026 et il est vrai que d\u2019embl\u00e9e, la premi\u00e8re impression est mauvaise : mise en sc\u00e8ne \u00e0 deux de tension, lenteur et inanit\u00e9 des dialogues, rigidit\u00e9 du jeu des com\u00e9diennes, la jolie Thelma y comprise.On sent \u00e9galement la patte typique du film d\u2019auteur \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de ses pompes et de son sujet, noy\u00e9 dans sa propre pr\u00e9tention de trou de balle qui p\u00e8te plus haut que son cul : du cin\u00e9ma d\u2019auteur\u2026 typique ! rapidement, on constate l\u2019absence de sc\u00e9nario dans ce merdier qui n\u2019en finit plus de s\u2019\u00e9tirer sur quasiment deux plombes\u2026 alors, \u00e7a meuble \u00e9videmment\u2026 \u00e9norm\u00e9ment.Certes, on comprend les \u00e9mois et contradictions (c\u2019est freudien\u2026) de la cocotte qui en pince grave pour sa copine en d\u00e9pit de son \u00e9ducation personnelle tr\u00e8s prude et puritaine (ses parents sont de vrais d\u00e9v\u00f4ts) mais tout de m\u00eame\u2026Quant \u00e0 l\u2019aspect \u00ab fantastique \u00bb, il est sous-utilis\u00e9 et d\u00e9sesp\u00e9r\u00e9ment minable, pour ne pas dire non avenu ; il ne faut pas s\u2019en \u00e9tonner puisque aucun sc\u00e9nario ne s\u2019est manifest\u00e9 lors de la \u00ab cr\u00e9ation \u00bb (?) de ce film de merde !

I thought its quite a mysterious film too although not everything is fully explained by the end. There are one or two sub plots which were intriguing but equally, it was a shame that there were so many loose ends. I think the part that most interested me was watching Thelma suffer from the suspected epileptic fits and her trying to figure out what had happened to her family in the past, which may be clues to her current affliction. I did feel there were perhaps one or two cliches present, in terms of the symbology used and the relationship aspect and I can't say its a film I'd want to watch again but if it sounds of interest, its worth a watch I suppose, yes."}], "recommendations": ["before_i_go_to_sleep", "the_killing_of_a_sacred_deer", "the_machinist", "stoker", "the_beguiled", "midnight_special", "the_lodge", "the_guilty", "you_were_never_really_here", "prisoners", "thoroughbreds", "ex_machina", "21_grams", "the_mothman_prophecies", "us", "searching", "the_night_house", "donnie_darko", "the_good_shepherd", "the_invisible_man", "what_lies_beneath", "unbreakable", "incendies", "a_history_of_violence", "melancholia"]}
