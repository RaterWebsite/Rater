Like the first film, it stops short of fully developing the drama it\u2019s going for, as though it\u2019s apathetic towards its own story."

Saldy this isn't one of them. Watch the first one instead."

While the beginning feels a tiny bit slow and in a few parts isn't keeping up with the 1st, once eggman and knuckles show up the movie never has a low point again. Exploring some fun with Sonic and Tails establishing their friendship and giving us some spins on the background for tails and knuckles. The movies action feels on par or better than what marvel has been putting out.  The voice cast does a fantastic job again and the writers do an amazing job with bringing these characters to life and playing up their known personalities and then some. I've been wanting to get to theater to see it a second time, but this will be a day 1 purchase when it goes on blu-ray.The film was exciting, fun to watch, a lot of characters from the 1st make cameos or reappearances and I'm hoping they do a third.Honorable Mention: Knuckles is a FANTASTIC character and has some of the best lines in the entire movie. They did such a great job with him!"

      "text": "As a Sonic fan who was unable to enjoy the first one, this sequel definitely is an improvement, a small one however, Sonic as a character is simply not as a funny as the writers intend  (simply spouting pop culture references is not comedy) and neither feels as both cokcy and inspiring as the source material version of Sonic while Knuckles, Tails and Knuckles are elevated versions of their game counterparts, they feel like more tangible characters and there was a good job on adapting them to this medium while sadly, Sonic remains simply a worst version of his counterpart. This movie also released barely over 2 years after the one and it shows,the script needed more time in the oven, the pacing is very clunky and there's a point where TOO many things happen for the sake of convenience or for exposition purposes. The most definitive improvement over the first one is how the movie looks, while making these movies live action/animation hybrid instead of fully animated was definitely a mistake that holds them back, when the movie goes fully into the territory of the game's visuals it reaches its best and most exciting moments."

Jim Carry is still working his magic, but Sonic and the rest of cast get a their fair share of screen time.  Gamers will be pleased with its calls to Sonic 1-3, as well.  Only wished they went with using the animals being forced into becoming machines.  Be aware there will be a Sonic 3!!"

Could have more platforming like in the games and even if the wedding scene was funny enough, it was too long and didn't feel like we were still in a Sonic movie. Jim Carrey was a joy though. Hope the rumours are not true and that we will see him again in Sonic 3"

This movie does all that, it's the best videogame movie adaptation ever without doubts. Jim Carrey once again delivers, as it seems that Dr. Eggman was handmade tailored for him to play. Sonic and is animal friends are the main characters and it's a joy to see them on the screen, human parts tend to drag a little but they are quick and far between to really burdun the movie. The last act it's the best last Boss fight feel a movie can be. Awesome time and great movie saw it 2x."

The dialogue was soo cringey I felt ill. The CGI looks like it's from the late 90's early 2000. Jim Carrey's performance is great, though sometimes he's more Jim Carrey, not enough Robotnic, making the character appear as less of a threat.If you're a Sonic fan, you'll find something to enjoy here. Just don't set your expectations high and you might not regret wasting 2 hours of your life.If you like cute little furry characters, flashy stuff and elaborate stories give you a headache.

You can tell that the people who worked on the film did their homework and know the franchise enough to deliver a fun movie for long time fans and casuals a like to enjoy.  I can say with confidence that the Sonic movies are the best movies based on a videogames series (Though, I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s saying a lot.)If there was one thing I didn\u2019t like about the movie, it would be all the stuff involving the Non-Sonic characters.  It just felt like they existed to stretch out the length time a bit and they didn\u2019t contribute all that much.  Don\u2019t forget to stick around for the mid-credits scene, it will BLOW YOU AWAY!I hope you bring you\u2019re A-game, untitled Illumination Mario film, cuz the \u201cSonic the Hedgehog\u201d movies have the bar set nice and high for ya!"

(Those who have seen the mid-credits scene will know what I mean.) The only problems I can find are the strange pacing and lacklustre comedy. While the first problem can be chalked up to the director not being used to the longer runtime, the comedy just isn't as good as the first film's. Which wasn't really that good outside of Jim Carrey's performance and a few other scenes. But, all of the problems can quickly be looked past if you enjoy the story, characters and exciting atmosphere of the film - which I think you will."

I enjoyed Sonic the Hedgehog 2, I have to say more than the first Sonic movie. My kids enjoyed it and for my kids to sit thru 2hrs straight without moving around just shows how much they enjoyed the movie.Now there are some down moments in this movie that I have to say was a bit unnecessary, like cringey jokes that didn't really land to well and other scenes in the movie that if they were edited out wouldn't make a difference to the movie at all.But all in all despite the few bad jokes and unnecessary scenes it didn't ruin the movie at all. In conclusion this is a great movie for everyone, families and Sonic fans alike.  It is worth seeing and I can't wait for another sequel. 9/10."

I don't understand how anyone can dislike this movie, especially since most of the bad reviews don't give any reasoning as to why it's bad.

While I do think that this film successfully accomplishes what it sets out to do, and kids will absolutely love it, it's incredibly familiar and formulaic. Weak jokes and inconsistent CGI with a bloated runtime that drags. Your enjoyment of this one will largely depend on how much you enjoyed the first instalment; personally, I thought this was a step down from the already mediocre first."

The only thing that brings it down from a 10 for me is all the unnecessary human drama with the wedding and the dumb deputy cop. I'm only dropping one point because the good stuff more than makes up for it, but I hope they don't make the same mistake in the next one (Please Jim, just one more!).

They finally got KNuckles right, finally, put some respect on knuckles' name, and Idris Elba did a great job voicing him. Hell, even the human characters and story was much better this time around as well."

A good movie to watch with the family and the kids loves the new characters. And the addition of Knucles and Tails is also very good. So, if you have any questions of watch this movie, I say, watch!"
