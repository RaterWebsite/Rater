Filmed in black and white and directed by Kenneth Branagh, this is a semi-autobiographical film based off his upbringing.

Really, the best way I can describe this film is that it feels like an Irish 'Roma'. It just felt rather derivative for my liking. Granted, the film's not without its charming moments, and the cast (particularly Caitriona Balfe and Dame Judi Dench) all give great performances, but none of that's quite enough to overcome a rather pedestrian, forcibly sentimental, and straightforward-feeling film that basically just felt like nothing more than Kenneth Branagh's 'Roma'."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "\u00c9 um filme goatoso de assistir, embora lento em algumas partes, voc\u00ea se sente parte da fam\u00edlia."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "\u201cBelfast,\u201d the new film by writer/director Kenneth Branagh (who starred in the \u201cWallander\u201d TV series, various Shakespeare productions on stage and screen), is a love letter to his childhood home filmed in black-and-white.  The film is set in 1969 in the midst of the Troubles between Catholics and Protestants in Belfast.  But for eight-year-old Buddy, armed conflict is a secondary backdrop to much more important matters:  swooning over the smartest girl in his class, watching US-made Westerns, going to the cinema.  Armed with a cardboard sword and a trash can shield in the opening scene, Buddy frolics in his mixed Protestant-Catholic neighborhood where everybody knows, and takes care of, everybody else.Branagh\u2019s consistent use of Buddy\u2019s point of view is the film\u2019s greatest strength and also its weakness.  The film is thoughtful, sweet and earnest.  But this consistent use of a child\u2019s perspective blurs and blunts the jolting realities surrounding Buddy, who is insulated by his watchful parents and nurturing neighborhood.  The storyline is slight.  It centers on a series of seemingly random remembrances by Branagh about his childhood.   (In case anyone wonders whether Buddy is Branagh, there\u2019s a brief scene of Buddy reading a \u201cThor\u201d comic book.  Branagh directed the film by the same name in 2011.)  The only creative tension is whether the family will join Pa in England, where he is employed on a construction project. (Branagh\u2019s father was a plumber and carpenter.)  Even so, there\u2019s plenty of material to celebrate a love of family, to seed the suspicion that there\u2019s a much larger world out there and to experience the sad wistfulness of loss.Despite the flimsiness of the storyline, several elements make this film a must-see.  First, Branagh has assembled an amazing ensemble of actors.  Judi Dench (one Oscar, 67 total awards, 179 award nominations) and Ciaran Hinds (a veteran character actor and Belfast native) are excellent as Buddy\u2019s grandparents.  Caitriona Balfe (\u201cOutlander\u2019) and Jamie Dornan (apparently used to being portrayed in shades of gray) are stellar as Ma and Pa.  In his first feature film, nine-year-old Jude Hill (Buddy) is simply amazing.  His energy, enthusiasm and wide-eyed innocence will totally capture any moviegoer with a soul.  Showing his nascent dramatic range, Hill convincingly inhabits the role of an eight-year-old.Second, Belfast native Van Morrison provides the dramatic, energetic score.  The soundtrack blends familiar tunes with striking new songs that open and close the film.  Throughout, Morrison provides an ideal texture for this piece.  Finally, the cinematography of Haris Zambarloukos (\u201cDeath on the Nile,\u201d \u201cLocke\u201d), who seems to revel in stark nighttime imagery, further elevates this film.The epigram at the end of the film reads \u201cFor those who stayed.  For those who left.  And for all the ones who were lost.\u201d  It\u2019s an excellent summation of Branagh\u2019s desire to be all-inclusive in his nostalgic tribute to an earlier, simpler time \u2013 that actually wasn\u2019t."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "H\u00e1 quem diga que todo diretor tem um filme pessoal e autobiogr\u00e1fico durante sua carreira, mas eu acredito que, quando n\u00e3o h\u00e1 muito o que dizer, voc\u00ea realmente n\u00e3o precisa fazer um.E aqui temos um exemplo do porqu\u00ea... \"Belfast\" \u00e9 superficial, caricato e raso, especialmente para um filme que \u00e9 descrito como pessoal e \u00edntimo pelo seu diretor, Kenneth Branagh.Boa parte do lado positivo de \"Belfast\" est\u00e1 em seu elenco, e ele inclui a sempre lend\u00e1ria Judi Dench, presente no melhor di\u00e1logo do longa, e o protagonista Jude Hill em uma estreia incr\u00edvel, na qual literalmente carrega o filme em suas pequenas costas, principalmente quando o roteiro puxa para o humor.Mas n\u00e3o h\u00e1 muito o que dizer durante os seus 97 minutos de dura\u00e7\u00e3o, mesmo que muita coisa esteja acontecendo na tela - e isso inclui explos\u00f5es, furtos e morte -, voc\u00ea n\u00e3o se apega de verdade \u00e0 narrativa, ainda que d\u00ea um sorriso de canto de boca aqui ou ali.S\u00f3 tirem a Judi Dench de casa para bons filmes, por favor."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "The love and care that was put into Belfast is evident.

The film, which comes across like a fusion of director John Boorman\u2019s \u201cHope and Glory\u201d (1987) and the nostalgic TV series The Wonder Years, tells the story of a sprightly young lad attempting to grow up as normally as possible in the face of a senseless religious-based civil war that began in 1969, one in which a once-peaceful, harmonious working class community is torn apart by forces that have no business intruding on the lives of good people trying to lead productive and cheerful lives. Told from the perspective of its youthful protagonist, \u201cBelfast\u201d plumbs material that many viewers can easily relate to \u2013 family dynamics, first loves, the joy of community and the endearment of adoring grandparents. Admittedly, there are times when viewers are left somewhat wanting for a little more dramatic depth, but the finely penned screenplay nevertheless delivers more than its share of emotionally touching moments and gentle humor, as well as evenly paced, well-developed treatment of its various story threads, all of which are suitably wrapped up by film\u2019s end. All of this is beautifully brought to life by the picture\u2019s superb black-and-white cinematography, its lively and fitting Van Morrison soundtrack, its skillful, sensitive direction, and the excellent performances of its fine ensemble cast, particularly newcomer Jude Hill, Irish actress Caitr\u00edona Balfe, and veterans Judi Dench and Ciar\u00e1n Hinds. It may be tempting to label this a feel-good movie, but that\u2019s too glib considering the backdrop under which the story takes place, one that gives the picture an edge and serves as a constant reminder of what can lurk in the underbelly of our reality no matter how otherwise pleasant our existence may seem."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "It was ok movie, but I think it didn't show enough also about the story what was happening around.

The release of Belfast this month was well-positioned for both awards buzz as well as family entertainment. Let's see how it does on both fronts.Kenneth Branagh wrote and directed Belfast drawing from his childhood memories of growing up in Northern Ireland. The film centers on Buddy (Jude Hill), a precocious kid, growing up in Belfast in the midst of growing turmoil between Protestants and Catholics. Buddy's family is entrapped by the danger on their street and are tested by their financial hardships. Buddy's Ma (Caitriona Balfe) holds down the fort and tries to protect Buddy and his brother while Buddy's Pa (Jamie Dornan) is working in England and only returns home every two weeks. Buddy's grandparents also have a prominent role in the film. As tensions grow between the warring factions, Buddy's family has to make a decision about whether to stay in the only home he's ever known or whether to escape to a safer situation.The storyline of Belfast is simple but effective. Branagh focuses on the care and affection these family members have for each other and their desperate need to protect each other. The film uses its black and white cinematography to evoke that feeling of memory and the music throughout mimics the emotions that permeate the tensions in the movie. Maybe I'm too ignorant, but I did not understand what the conflict was between the Protestants and Catholics and why it was so violent in Belfast at the time. Buddy must not either since the film is told from his perspective and we don't get much explanation about that. Nevertheless, the coming-of-age drama hits the marks one would expect and Branagh clearly has an emotional connection to the material that is conveyed in each frame.My biggest issue with Belfast is Jude Hill. He's just alright. Sometimes child actors suffer trying to carry these types of films. Roman Griffin Davis did a great job anchoring Jojo Rabbit. Alan Kim was pretty good in Minari. Remember Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense! Jude Hill is no Haley Joel. Sorry, Buddy. He doesn't ruin the movie, but either another actor needed to be cast or the focus should have been more on the adults. Both Caitriona Balfe and Jamie Dornan give good performances that add emotional weight to the film. You get more of the stakes from Balfe and Dornan than from Hill. Maybe that's asking too much of the kid.Ultimately, I understand why Belfast is an Oscar hopeful. It has a sentimental story that plays on the emotions with good performances from the adult cast. Despite my reservations about Jude Hill\u2019s performance, the otherwise simple story hits the marks of this kind of drama. It\u2019s a good movie, but I wouldn\u2019t call it any better than these other coming-of-age family dramas. Get a bowl of popcorn for a Sunday matinee since it\u2019s only in theaters."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "admirable[ ad-mer-uh-buhl ]adjectiveworthy of admiration; inspiring approval, reverence, or affection."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "A serious contender for Film of The Year.

The truth probably lies somewhere within the \"what 'Belfast' seems to lack in intrigue or dramatic bombast\" portion of the above, as I genuinely did find my interest in things stalling every now and then, acquainting myself with the clock on my phone more times than I would've liked. I'll say that I reckon this lack of investment more so comes from the sort of \"two ships passing in the night\" phenomena that'll sometimes happen between me and a perfectly fine movie; one of those ships being the movie, the other being my specific preferences as a filmgoer.

This could've been masterful, but it wasn't, in my opinion. Again, I'm sure why.I mean, all the performances here are the strongest element of this movie. Newcomer Jude Hill delivered a great performance, especially for his age. Caitriona Balfe and Jamie Dornan were both fantastic. Judi Dench and Ciar\u00e1n Hinds, both play an old couple, were so sweet and charming together that it never fails to make smile.The black and white cinematography was good, as it has that old nostalgic \"blast from the past\" vibe to it. But film making wise, it wasn't anything too impressive.The scene towards the end where Jamie Dornan sings a cover of Everlasting Love was something special. It made it more special seeing Caitriona's face when she lifts her eyebrows and smiles at the man she loves, and the way he smiles back at her.

I will not be surprised if this clears up at awards season and it deserves every one of them.Buddy (Jude Hill) is a young boy living in Belfast in the late 1960s with his brother Will (Lewis McAskie) and their mother played by Caitriona Balfe. Their father played by Jamie Dornan travels overseas to work and is often away for long periods of time. Buddy is preoccupied with the normal problems of an 11-year-old all while trying to make sense of the violence happening around him during a hugely turbulent time in Belfast. Similarly to how Jojo Rabbit handled the trauma of war from a child's perspective, Belfast finds the balance between light-hearted humour and tragedy. It's funny and highly emotional. If you're the type to cry easily at movies then you may need to get the tissues ready.Jude Hill is the shining star in Belfast, you can't help but love him, he's absolutely wonderful. Stand out performances also include Caitriona Balfe, Judi Dench and Ci\u00e1ran Hinds. Director Kenneth Branagh certainly knew what he was doing when he gathered the cast for Belfast. Everyone is absolutely brilliant it's easy to see how this could do very well in awards season, even Jamie Dornan who can almost be forgiven for that horrendous Irish accent in Wild Mountain Thyme. Beautifully directed in black and white with the use of colour where appropriate. I loved the references to older movies and the excitement in Buddy's face during his cinema trips.

The Catholic/Protestant conflict was bigger than whatever church you belonged to. A lot of similarities to what's going on again in our world today.  Great cast. Great music. Superb filmaking."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Wonderful performances, and Branagh's autobiographical point of view adds an authenticity to the neighborhood scenes.  Relevant to now and the many times in history ordinary people saw their happy lives turned into nightmares.  But the second half of the movie descends into the worst form of make believe sentiment; it's pretty awful, and so much potential was lost."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Belfast is too cute and at the same time manages to be so depressing and heartbreaking that in the end you think it's one of Kennet's best works"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Imagine a mix between Jojo Rabbit and Roma. It is a beautifully shot film that is very sweet and sentimental. One can really tell it is quite personal for the director, Kenneth Branagh, on which this story is loosely based on. If you want just a lovely little film to watch from this year, I would highly recommend this one."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Spectacular film by Kenneth Branagh that shows a side of the unrest in NI through the view of a child. Jude Hill is incredible as Buddy. Every emotion is written on his face and he is stunning to watch. Judi Dench & Ciar\u00e1n Hinds are a phenom as Granny and Pop. The standout for me is Caitr\u00edona Balfe who emits somuch emotion as a wife and mother doing her best to protect her family and marriage but at what cost? Everyone needs to see this cinematic beauty! The black and white is so fitting and really allows you to see the characters and emotions rather than focus on blinding colors. Truly brilliant film!"}], "recommendations": ["legends_of_the_fall", "carol", "spencer", "american_beauty", "minari", "the_glass_castle", "20th_century_women", "call_me_by_your_name", "lion", "the_best_exotic_marigold_hotel", "the_danish_girl", "joy", "gifted", "blue_valentine", "green_book", "marriage_story", "a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood", "the_light_between_oceans", "youth", "eddie_the_eagle", "stand_by_me_doraemon_2", "phantom_thread", "finding_neverland", "casablanca", "scent_of_a_woman"]}
