      "text": "Nice photography, crisp and sharp for 1980, Nestor Almendros was a brilliant photographer-his first movie was Days of Heaven for Terence Malick, and that movie is a high water mark photographically.  Randal Kleiser had directed Grease and Saturday Night Fever so he's talented.  it was very successful, earning over $50m on a $5m budget.  This was fun, innocent and a beautiful movie."
