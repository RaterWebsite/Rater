Didn\u2019t recognize some of the characters until I looked them up but a pretty sweet cast with a history of good work.  I was going to give it a b+ but knowing it\u2019s an independent film I added a little because this wasn\u2019t a 20 million dollar budget and it kept me interested until the end, so I give it an A-"
