In a way the world building in this movie comes off as if it's a B story to the movie blade (blade without the blade), but that's not a bad thing. It's entertaining and worth a watch if you like this genre, I suspect this movie won't get a fair rating given that people are more interested in score manipulation, voting things 0 or 10 but this is a solid 6.5/10."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "For a vampire movie, it's extremely passive.It can be argued that it was trying something different, but when dealing with these creatures you need more than just an idea that tries to sustain itself on the basis of a style, rather than an argument.And I must say that the lack of action gets boring after a while.Debby Ryan and Lucy Fry's characters evidently believe themselves to be real bad girls, but that only works when they are given something more to do than just that.They're cool, killer vampire girls, I get it, but can we get them to do something else?Oh and one of them gets in love with Jorge Lendeborg Jr.'s character. Like, I totally didn't see that one coming.Whole third act is completely predictable, especially the ending.This is the new direct-to-video.

Great performances from the 3 leads. Now Netflix should make a sequel!"}, {"rating": "6", "text": "I liked this film personally because it checks a lot of boxes of things I enjoy in vampire films. Cute female vampires, morally grey character arc, main character becomes a vampire, etc. However, even liking the film myself, I have to admit that it's objectively bad. There are little plotholes, things that make you go 'wait, but how did that come to happen??', the dialogue and characters are full of cliches. There's a weird lack of character motivation, the main character seems to passively sway between 'desperate to save his brother' and 'literally committing murder to assist the people trying to kill his brother'. It's a weird movie, with weird flow, and a bizarre lack of focus on what seems to be the highest-stake story (that of the character Jay, though I must admit that while it might have been an objectively better movie had it focused on Jay's journey, I myself certainly would not have liked it). If you enjoy lady vampires, blood, and morally grey main characters who have an extremely unclear motive (like I do) you'll like this movie. If you're looking for good cinema, you probably won't. But what can I say? That's just how it is."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "For a random movie i just stumbled upon on Netflix, i was pleasantly surprised i liked it as much as i did.
