The Babadook is a highly accomplished debut feature - great film making, powerfully performed and utterly terrifying."

      "text": "Definitely overrated. Its not a bad movie but I thought it was long winded and ultimately not very convincing regardless of what you thought happened in the end. The biggest problem however is that it was not original, which is hard to do. But for that reason, I cannot really rate this thing over a 7. It brought nothing new to the table that we had not seen before and frankly I thought the kid was over acting while the mother was underacting or was just not believable in many ways. Again, its a horror movie so I am not expecting much but at the same time the movie itself didnt have much else to talk about. It was not fun like some horror movies and it was not written well enough to feel plausible. Its kind of like Friday the 13th taking itself seriously... A solid 6 in my opinion."

Over the years horror movies have become cliched and predictable, but this movie gives us something new and fresh. You don't need that many jump scares to make a good horror movie, just unsettling behavior, and an unnerving environment and situations. Once you see this movie, you'll never think of pop-up books the same way again!"

      "text": "A perfect blend of sound effects and editing zapping you with an enormous \"boo\".The BabadookJennifer Kent's debut as a writer-director is a monstrous call for attention. It is surprisingly one of those few horror flicks that I have encountered that fully uses every aspect of filmmaking in one direction. It channels everything to one simple thing. And it is not a scream that she wants from you, nor an awe gasping moment and definitely not a cheap elaborative sketch spread across the script for an insensitive commercial parlour trick. What she is interested in throwing out, is the character driven plot. All those scenes tied together just gives you a very strong case on what and how theses characters work. And they work fine. More than fine. They are extremely diligent on what they look like.How they are received by the others. In fact, every character is interested in doing so. Even the demons come with an introduction, a warning and are interested in following those set rules by them. They want to be taken seriously. Like they hold importance. A value that they could never reach. But would like to possess. And that is the crux of the supernatural element in the film. The entity is something that is not considered real.The psychological system feeds on fear and grows on your weakness or at least that's what we are told. And maybe that's why among these many set of characters, the kid, the child stands out different. His inexpressive behaviour, nature without any pattern doesn't make sense and it also does. This normalized humane behaviour that blends in at the back of our mind is what's alienated throughout the film. The Babadook then truly transforms into a monstrous lie. The horror title is deserved and the payoff is the oddest emotion that we carry and that is of course that we are attached to the idea."

But after seeing the 1 star reviews of this film,i just felt compelled.Firstly,what this is.I would say a cross between The Shining and We Need to talk about Kevin. This film is desperately sad. A woman who is haunted,first by her husbands death,then by the Babadook all while looking after her young son. This is a creepy, no jump scare, fantastic psychological horror. A rare gem that plays on all those fairytale fears that you may have had as a kid.Second.What this isn't?!Well,not \"The worst horror in years\".I get that people have different opinions.I do.But this isn't a film that can justify that sort of nonsensical comment. It isn't a dull jump scare-filled blockbuster. The characters are not hot teenagers. They are believable, disturbed and this makes the film the slow,creeping horror that it is.If you are a fan of horror,it really is a must see film"

This movie made me reflect upon my own life and that is rare coming from a horror movie.

However, i believe the user score is not as high as people have become accustomed to and expectant of a overused horror trope nowadays: the jump scare. This film has no jumpscares what so ever and this is why some people may not like it as much as they expect to s**t themselves for a second and then be \"all is okay now\". The thing that makes the Babadook so scary is that it relies on psychological horror and it's engaging and complex storyline that can actually be dissected and analysed instead of most horror films typical \"this person is possessed, save them\" or \"there is a monster coming to kill us, we must run\" or \"there's ghosts haunting us\". This films psychological horror really is a breath of fresh air as it's eerie, dark and ambiguous tone and atmosphere really send shivers done your spine. This never makes you jump really, but more makes you feel uncomfortable and unsettled. The performances are spot on by Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman plays his role excellently: he seems annoying and ungrateful and then turns sympathetic and understandable. 10/10 for creating an original horror that good es back to it's roots; it wants to chill you for days instead of make you jump for a few seconds. One of the classics of horror now. 10/10. Bravo to Jennifer Kent for creating this masterpiece."

His hallucinations spiral out of control, he becomes more unpredictable and violent. Amelia, genuinely frightened by her son's behaviour, is forced to medicate him.\r They are so many bad horror films out there right now that I'm pretty tired and sick of seeing, but The Babadook is not like those films. This horror movie did something that Annabelle or Ouija couldn't do, and that is try to be original and scary.\r Babadook is a movie that got under my skin if I got to be honest. The chilling and uneasy atmosphere and it's sense of fear that this movie truly nails it for me and not like most horror films today that lost that sense fear and just allow on lazy Jump scars. The acting in this movie was so real and so top notch that I got to say that Essie Davis did excellent in this movie, even the little kid did good.\r The other thing that this movie get's right is the fact it says \"F'ck jump scares\", and tries to scary the viewing auditions and not be throwing loud sounds to make some people jump a little bit, no it goes for the good old fashioned method of a good horror film and that is showing frighting images that will stick in your mind until the movie is over.\r My only problems with this movie is it's slow at the beginning and the ending to the movie was a bit ridiculous if I got to say.\r But overall The Babadook is more than you're cliche monster movie, it focus on doubt's and depression which made the movie even scary, because if you got doubt's and depression running throw your head and meanwhile there might be something out there after you and your kid then it can mess with your mind and cause terror."

The Babadook starts off slow, building tension between a stressed out mother and her son, who I can only assume suffers from some form of mental handicap. Throughout the first half, the film builds tension, but never enough to have you on the edge of your seat, just barely enough to keep your eyes on the screen. The second half of the movie is even worse. There is a climax that just feels rushed and sloppy, and the ending literally caused me to throw my hands up in the air. It was just, terrible, for lack of a better word. There is nothing scary about The Babadook. There is little even worth watching in The Babadook. The only saving grace was the beautifully crafted book they used in the movie. Outside of that one prop, this film was an utter waste of time.

You empathize with the mom a bit for dealing with the little sh\u00a1t but she isnt very likable either. Perhaps through the use of flashblacks they could have made you care about them more or if they added more characters to help give context rather than isolate the characters then they could have achieved the same result.

For me it deserves 10 on a scale of 1 to 10, because it was a great movie that really worked thanks to Jennifer Kent's amazing storytelling, and let's hope they launch The Babadook Book because I really loved its iconic character."

      "text": "Though not totally scary, this movie clearly serves as a complex psychological drama that keeps you in suspense the whole time. The performances are remarkable, the scenery and filming are unusually excellent, but the best part is the plot itself.. Is Amelia fighting a real monster, or her own and broken memories and ghosts? To make it simple, this movie is not only spooky and weird, but also emotive and (most of all) mesmerizing."

      "text": "Jennifer Kent directs \"The Babadook\" the knew Australian Horror film, starring Essie Davis. This movie does not rely on pointless jump-scares or loud noises to be unsettling. This movie disturbed me more then any other thriller or horror film has since Johnathan Demme's \"The Silence of the Lambs\". And it even could be the best thriller since \"The Silence of the Lambs\".\rThis film has been compared to Stanley Kubrick's \"The Shining\". I can see why. The film-making strategy and over all story are very similar, but the use of electrify imagery, and implications outmatches \"The Shining\", by a huge margin.\rJennifer Kent's debut is exciting. If any of her upcoming projects are half as good as this one is, we may have the next Spielberg."

      "text": "Much less a horror film than a chiller, \"The Babadook\" was a complex and profoundly unnerving film. It really was very good at making me squirm uncomfortably in my seat. Its use of imagery and sound to unsettle me, rather than jump scares to catch me off-guard, made it a far more interesting and worthwhile experience. I was not frightened, per se, but I was certainly creeped out. Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman gave exceptional performances and I'm pleased Davis is getting so much critical recognition for her role, as she is unlikely to get much attention on the major awards circuit, which is a damned shame because she plays her role to perfection, embodying both the victim and the villain of the movie by its gut-wrenching end. I did not enjoy \"The Babadook\", I did not need to. If I enjoyed it, it would not have been half as good as it was."

For a 7 yr old, Noah Wiseman is a fantastic actor!\rAn interesting story, an \"A\" rated performance from the cast, and witful directing from Jennifer Kent round up this movie's strongest points. The ending though was rather dull and not quite what I expected, but I think it would have really soured my day if it concluded on a more tragic note (like most horror movies do).\rIn all, The Babadook is an enjoyable movie!"
