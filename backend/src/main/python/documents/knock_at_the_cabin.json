I haven't been seeing people explain why this is such a terrible movie, but here is my reasoning as to why this movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I love Keanu Reeves, but why would he even accept to be in this utter trash pile? Not only is this movie unrealistic to the fullest, but it's actually supporting the toxic ideology that men cant be r*ped, or taken advantage of, by women. It's making the women seem like their actions are in the right when they're the ones that decided to spy on Evan, Keanu Reeves, and take advantage of him. They are not morally in the right and the fact Eli Roth makes it seem like they are is extremely dangerous. The predictability and acting are terrible, even Keanu was not good, and, as I mentioned before, it is very unrealistic. You will never ever convince me that a person who is Keanu's size can not physically dominate 2 people as small and weak as the girls in this movie. Even if a person Keanu's size was hit unexpectedly in the head by these girls and tied up, they would not, realistically, cry, plead and whine the entire time. It angered me that Keanu accepted to play such a pitiful character because realistically a person like Keanu would end up finding a way out and would end up killing these girls. That's why it's shocking that they ended the movie with these girls winning. There was absolutely no plot. All they did was relay a clear message that these girls were the \"good people\" in this movie. Also, the scene when Louis comes in, the guy picking up Evan's wife's sculpture, and finds Evan tied up, was stupid and it seemed to just downplay a man's intelligence. Because realistically no one would care about a sculpture being damage more than a literal person tied up and visibly cut. He left Evan still tied up because he was more concerned about an object... That would never happen. This movie would have been immensely better if Keanu actually escaped, even after being tortured quite a bit, and killed those 2 women. Instead, they clearly wanted to promote misandry and sexism. I am convinced whoever wrote this script is either unethical beyond belief or they're intellectually slow and don't know how to make a movie."

Unfortunately, it emerges, neither do the filmmakers. What follows is an inexplicably stupid parody of 2005's Hard Candy, rather than an a geuinenly scary gore-fest that Eli Roth is known for. Instead, we get an hour and a half of painful cackling, cringe-worthy dialogue, false moral dilemmas and a story so beyond laughable that I was genuinely rooting for the protagonist to die, simply so the film would finally end.Eli Roth seems to be bored of torturing the characters in his films, and has instead turned his sadistic streak onto his audiences, for all the wrong reasons. And trust me, by the end of it, you'll be begging it to stop."

My one complaint about Cabin is the cheap joke at the end, calling back an earlier scene (the \"my **** line). And he does the same here, with a cheap callback joke as the final line. Why Roth decided to reboot an old 30 plus year old C-movie that starred Colleen Camp, Sandra Locke (both producers here) and Seymour Cassell is anyone's guess. Unless he was intrigued by the standard universal theme of temptation and it's results. Knock Knock starts well, setting up the family dynamic, although Reeves just can't pull off warm and cuddly Daddy. Spending Father's Day alone working, while wife and kids are away, a couple of young, nubile, and wet (of course it's a dark and stormy night) ladies come knocking at his door. Reeves tries to be gentlemanly, moving to a single chair, everytime the ladies get too close. But little Keanu gets the best of him, and he beds both of them. This is where the movie becomes the \"from hell\" sub genre thriller. You know the \"from hell\" genre...the husband from hell, the roommate from hell, the TEMP from hell, etc.etc. The ladies, Lorenza Izzo and Ana de Armas, work on destroying Reeves from that point. And the movie goes completely off the rails. Game show parody, paper mached corpse, torture by volume...and a scene where Reeves loses it that has to be seen to be believed. I think Roth told him just to go bat shirt crazy...And the ladies, tho attractive as can be, are more annoying than menacing. I never thought or felt they were truly dangerous. And the acting. There are times that I thought I was watching a bad SNL skit. If this is the indication of Roth's career, no Taratino connection is going to keep him from a career of direct-to-DVD releases."

My only guess as to why this movie is rated as good as it is is due to the nudity of the young ladies and Keanu Reeves. Besides that, I can't imagine why this movie got such high ratings. The movie explains little to nothing as to why the characters are in the situation they are in, nor does it give much background behind the characters, not even the antagonists who are supposed to be OH so important. Considering the lengths at which they go to for, yet another, fairly unexplained reason. Besides the setting, the actions the character takes are simply convenient for the sake of plot development, and fairly inaccurate to the perception we are given from the character's various other actions up until the point they do something completely unexpected of their personality."

Reviewers have been unkind to the two lead actresses and their take on jail bait from hell--but they do what they can given Eli Roth's hand's off direction. Reeve's performance is the weak link. His wooden stolidity helps in setting himself up as the repressed pseudo-hip square stuck on his decades old self-image as a cool daddy hipster; but as the film drags on his stuck in neutral awkwardness offers nothing below the textual surface for the girls to play off of--there's no emotional subtext interaction behind the cliched motivations hard wired into the script. At the end the final line spoken fails as a comic payoff and echoes off as a receding non-sequittur into the credits.\r Nice cinematography and tracking given the one-set location."

I can stomach graphic depictions of gore and mutilation, but not sexual assault. So the way this is centered around the far less heinous crime of cheating allowed me to enjoy the ensuing carnage without my mood having been soured by the main plot device.While tamer in the blood and guts department than one would typically expect an Eli Roth film to be, watching these women ruin the protagonist's life is nonetheless a blast. Their methods of torment are disturbing, darkly comedic, and on a surprising note even genuinely erotic at times. Plus, the torture never feels especially vile as it's easy to see the whole situation the guy finds himself in is his own darn fault. I'm not saying the punishment really fit the crime, that he wasn't rather aggressively cajoled into the threesome, or that a woman isn't capable of molesting a man. However, no one forced him to have sex with those girls in this case so he doesn't exactly have my sympathy here.In fact, the only thing that was suspect to me about the whole thing was the acting. Particularly that of Reeves himself. The John Wick star has always caught a lot of flack for perhaps not being the most talented leading man in Hollywood, which is a bit harsh in my opinion. For a low budget movie of this caliber though, he does a fine job. At least when his character isn't being subjected to physical pain that is. His reactions in these scenes are admittedly laughable at best.Knock Knock is simply a whole lot of fun, and when you consider that all Eli Roth has ever wanted to do is make a bunch of dumb, amusing grindhouse throwbacks there's an argument to be made that this is the best work of his career. For once his stupid sense of humor isn't a hindrance, but instead actually a boon to the movie! Allowing you to revel in the absurdity with greater glee. The director took a concept usually reserved for crummy, pseudo rom-coms and applied it to a genuinely effective horror-thriller format that brings every man's worst nightmare, having to pay for infidelity, to life in gruesome fashion and the results are pretty fantastic.

With better performances, uses of technology, a story with appropriate plot twists and a better directing, this new version shows the multifaceted that could be the director, without the presence gore that characterizes him, OK, at least without so much blood.\r With a predictably moderate result at the box office, \"Knock Knock\" is a fresh and lush proposal to the commercial films and while it is not the masterpiece of the season, it is one of the independent films more entertaining of the year. Roth arrives with strength to the suspense genre, with one idea we've already seen, but with a view more modern and modified about itself, perhaps is a remake or maybe not.\r Keanu Reeves plays Evan, a happily married architect, father of two children, with fortune, love, DJ hobbies, a beautiful house, in summary an idealized life, what else can he ask for?. Then, his two children and his wife take a nice vacation to the beach - on the occasion of father's day, a big irony-, Evan and Monkey left alone at home working on his project. On a rainy and simply sinister night, two beautiful and stunning girls innocently knock on the Evan's door, under the pretext of help, since they have lost on the way to a party. This merciful man - though, after I watch this movie so many times, in the third time, I can see the desire of Evan, it is logical, he is a man - allows them to enter for one call or maximum one coffee cup. Bel (Ana de Armas) and Genesis (Lorenza Izzo, the wife and constant contributor to Roth) are male sexual fantasy. After asking a taxi and have a talk about faithfulness and sex, things become dangerous and Evan's love for his family is thrown into the toilet.\r Evan has sexual relations with the two girls - something relatively impossible considering the age of Evan, but relatively possible considering that morning his wife not wanted help him, affirming that he took  more than three months without having sexual relations -, naive and innocent of the hell that was to come. Once the guys begin to show their bad behavior, Evan feels in trouble and goes in a direction that will not help him. Things come up to the limit of gag to Evan, unintentionally killing a person and destroy all the house. The previous is made to give a lesson to all husband who believe to be faithful, but that \"fidelity\" word  is what less used inside their mind.\r Idea is completely brand-new, however, its end leaves the audience unsatisfied, thrilled and even disappointed. It feels like a failed experiment, feels like a work that had a stupid ending, it is illogical to which after a great development finishes with a finish so poor and cheap in order to show a consequence.\r Moral themes is most used in dramatic and thriller films, but the issues touched in this film are substantially used them and share a better connection with the audience due to everyday life and reminiscence of them in life any common man. It is not a feminist film, it is not a male chauvinist film, Roth manages to get that balance of genre in order to do not be wrong about taking his project where it should not go.\r Ana de Armas and Lorena Izzo are fabulous in their roles, however, momentarily, they get rid of the psychology and strange behavior that had. The classification R, they gave to the film is opportune, since, in addition to having strong sexual scenes, profanity and violence, these girls transmit horror, a genre that apparently are not visible, but after seeing the work these two women, the horror reincarnated in the beauty. Reeves also makes a great role here, different than what he has done so far, revealing its full potential with his monologue \"free pizza\".\r Technological contributions make much with little, recorded in one house with fascinating interior design, Roth knows how to slide his camera through the corridors and walls full of art and paintings, giving a modern twist to a house of a familiar aura.\r Last Roth's film- and hopefully it is not the last, really -  plays very well exposed moral issues, with photography and cinematography very well executed, but narratively falls short and not in its development, in its empty and simple end."

Even Keanu Reeves wasn't enough humiliated for my taste, I am not his admirer and in my humble opinion he deserves worse than that. So, I am not much impressed, Hard Candy was way better than this."

But somehow I'm wondering, could their be some coincidence between having Keanu recently play these parts primary for the solo lead, and having suddenly going on these movies that deal out anger and revenge against \"Keanu\", by girls bent on getting exactly what they want weather or not they are actually seeking something that requires a goal. Even in a small part like the one in \"Neon Demon\".  Suddenly all women are out to get what they want going through, Evan Weber, and mostly feel sorry for the girls who don't think that they would \"really\" like to reach out and get something from this innocent guy.  Like he's inviting some fanatic fan to get vulgar and ignorant and then just turn the other cheek, nothings out of the ordinary!  As long as in the end the punishment sets out and finds it's purpose."

Nach der Menschenfresser-Hommage The Green Inferno wendet sich Roth in der Home-Invasion-Variante Knock Knock einem anderen bekannten Thema zu. Architekt Evan bleibt das Wochenende daheim, w\u00e4hrend sich die Familie am Strand sonnt. Zum Arbeiten kommt er jedoch nicht, denn pl\u00f6tzlich stehen zwei vom Regen durchn\u00e4sste M\u00e4dels in der T\u00fcr \u2013 und bevor das rettende Taxi kommt, landet man sich windend in Bad und Bett. Der Morgen ist ein Schlag ins Gesicht: Die zu v\u00f6lligen Psychopathinnen mutierten Girls wollen nicht gehen und nehmen Evan die Designer-Butze auseinander \u2013 und bei Sachsch\u00e4den bleibt es nicht. Ziemlich frech schnappt sich Eli Roth den Plot von Death Game und die Psychospielchen von Funny Games und Hard Candy, nutzt aber statt Subtilit\u00e4t stets den Holzhammer. Doch das holprige Drehbuch, h\u00f6lzerne Dialoge und ein wirklich mieser Keanu Reeves \u00e4ndern nichts daran, dass Knock Knock als trashiger Thriller einen Riesenspa\u00df macht."

      "text": "Pretty dark film that is unconventional in the way it approaches the erotic horror genre. The antagonists are very sinister and act well, minus a few hiccups. However, the protagonist and deuteragonist on the other hand convey poorly at times. The crisis the protagonist finds himself in is intriguing, but some of the plot devices against him are too convenient and severely contrived. As a result, this makes me struggle to sympathise with him. Overall, Knock Knock boasts impressive potential with its thought-provoking plot, demonstrating how powerful young girls can be to anyone. But their hard work becomes undone by irritating plot devices which exist merely to shift the plot forward. Should a sequel be in the works, the script must be further scrutinised to make things a bit more believable."

Stick to action movies where you only speak with guns and karate kicks, and you'll continue to do just fine, Mr. Wick. Seriously, he's a great action star!That being said, I'd watch Ana de Armas fold socks... all day long."

I lost count of the number of times Keanu Reeves could have overpowered these two skinny girly-girls and gotten out of his predicament.  At one point he is taken down by a dinner fork to his upper pectoral and subdued.  By a 115 pound chick.  Yes, you heard that right.  I won't even mention the other ridiculous moments where his character responds so pathetically when opportunity arises that you stop rooting for him.  The plot is so poorly written, they had to build plot armor around the two female sociopath antagonists by having Keanu's character repeatedly fail in the lamest of ways.  Add to that the horribly written dialogue, where Keanu is still trying to morally defend himself late in the story to a couple of giggling and deranged psychos, the fact that these girls convince Keanu that they're underage after sleeping with him, when they are clearly in their twenties, and scenes of them gleefully trashing the house like a couple of cheerleaders on crack, and you have a very bad comedy posing as a thriller.  The scene with a would-be rescuer had me watching dumbfounded at its stupidity at how they got the better of him, not to mention how he inexplicably stops untying Keanu halfway through to confront the girls alone.  Then we see the girls dig a professional-looking rectangular hole in the backyard nearly six feet deep using two shovels and their spindly arms.  They must really work out.  Of course we find out at the end that these girls do this home invasion to married men all over, and somehow manage to get away with it despite leaving a trail of destruction and even bodies in their wake, along with a weak jab at the male patriarchy that the guys have this coming for being such pervs that when naked twenty-somethings start groping them, the guy stops resisting.  We never learn what motivates these girls and why they feel the need to punish husbands and fathers, only that the blonde one has clear daddy issues.  To even suggest that this is a \"pyschological\" thriller when the psychological component is so poorly developed is an insult to psychological thrillers. This movie might have worked if it made fun of itself and was deliberately campy, like the entertaining Babysitter films, but it doesn't. From the bad writing, poorly scripted action, and sketchy moral message, Knock Knock fails on every level."

      "text": "Eli Roth's 'Knock Knock' can be enjoyed on a \"so-bad-it's-good\" level. This is the kind of film that has an interesting premise, but it does get lost in its own ludicrous and obnoxious execution. The film centers around a man named Evan (Keanu Reeves), who is happily married and has two young children. He works as an architect and during a father's day weekend, his family decide to hit the beach while he has the house all to himself to focus on his work. During that first rainy night, he hears a knock on his door, he answers it to see two estranged young girls, soaking in the rain, Genesis (Lorenza Izzo) and Bell (Ana De Armas) who claim to be heading to some party and are lost along the way. Being the good guy that he is, Evan decides to welcome them into his home and help them out with their situation. The girls seem to really like Evan and he shows them around while they wait. Little does he know that things start to get somewhat suspicious as he finds them in the shower and they try to seduce him, he tries to resist, but ultimately gives in. The next morning, he finds the two girls disrupting his peaceful weekend alone. They mess around and even begin to act with over-the-top results. It becomes clear to him that they were not who they claim they were. He tries to get rid of them, but they soon come back to play some sadistic games with Evan as their victim. As I said before, the movie does tell an interesting story, even for one made by typical gore master, Eli Roth. The gender politics story does contain some commentary about the reactionary differences between our characters as well as the punishment for what our main character has to face, even though he did nothing wrong. It still has that sadistic edge that Roth is known for. The main problem with the movie does fall in the sense that its interesting message gets lost in a campy and sometimes horribly acted result, even the lines of dialogue can be ridiculous. Keanu Reeves - at times - was channeling Nicolas Cage's performance, specifically, from 'The Wicker Man' (2006), the over-the-top shouting, as well as becoming a victim to women. You'll enjoy this movie on the same level as 'The Wicker Man' (2006) or maybe 'The Room' (2003), other than that, it tells a very known message, but maybe, it could have been handled by a more dramatically capable director."
