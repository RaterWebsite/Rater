Depp and his character are also very underutilized. Probably the only really GOOD things about this movie are that last 15 minutes and the opening sequence and once again James Newton Howard score is mind-blowingly great. Sure the some of the acting or visual effects are solid,but the terrible script and the snailed pacing AND The twist,OMG it is unimaginable,it makes no sense to me and feels out of nowhere,so dumb.This movie to me has started to feel like what the Star Wars prequel had become,just placeholder,they add barely anything."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "A bit disappointing but i still liked the Movie.

Personally, I am one of many teens who read all the books and saw all the films but I was very disappointed with \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d. However, I decided to watch this film and see if there would be any improvement here. And I'm glad I did. Far from being wonderful, its much better than its predecessor.After the events of the first film, Newt Scamander is sent by Dumbledore to Paris in order to look for Credence, who survived. Also alive and gone missing is the fearsome Gellert Grindelwald, responsible for many deaths and atrocities, committed to starting a war for global dominance in which sorcerers are to dominate non-sorcerers.Its a generally better film than its predecessor, as it has a lighter pace and takes much less time to develop. The story told seems to have gained a logical thread and that's a good thing. The use and appearance of magical creatures was not as intense as in the first film, and this may have helped to focus the film on the story which, until now, was too weak and uninteresting. However, too much creativity is also a problem as some ideas in the plot end up useless. The development of the characters improved and the material given to the actors was certainly better. David Yates did a good job and takes advantage of all his experience, as he directed the most adult and developed films in the Harry Potter franchise.The cast, certainly due to a better script and material to work on, achieved better results. Despite all this, it continues to make unforgivable mistakes. Some sub-plots, sequences and even characters, like Flamel for example, are totally unnecessary. Eddie Redmayne finally manages to give Scamander a certain attitude and leadership, although he is still uncharismatic and boring. Katherine Waterston also improves here. Callum Turner is good, Zo\u00eb Kravitz was a good addition to the role of the psychologically complex Leta Lestrange and Jude Law shone as the intelligent and young Dumbledore. Less positive was Dan Fogler, who is no longer as funny as in the first film. If this ends up being compensated by gaining dramatic depth, the film gives a terrible excuse to justify his presence, given that the character had been \u201cobliviated\u201d, that is, had his memories erased at the end of the first film. On the negative side, I would highlight the poor performance of Alison Sudol. It was not her fault but the fact is that her sweet and stupid character stopped being sweet and became just stupid. Finally, we need to talk more about Johnny Depp. If the cameo in the first film achieved to hide what his participation was going to be, this film shows us the greatness of the actor in the role of another fearsome villain, who is not far behind Voldemort in malice and cruelty. The actor is good and brought his character to life in a brilliant way. If everything goes well for Depp in the films that follow, this could become one of the most outstanding characters in his career, who has left us great jobs before.Technically, this is a very visual film, thanks to tons of very high quality CGI, as we would expect in the Harry Potter universe. Cinematography has good colors, a good use of light and dark and clear footage. To add aesthetic quality we have the charm of the Thirties, with its props and clothings. Much of the film is set between London and Paris, with a brief and unnecessary passage through Hogwarts, and the sets, in all these moments, were meticulously done. The soundtrack, by James Newton Howard, is good and epic, but not surprising."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "This movie was definitely more in line with the spirit of where the series is heading-the first Fantastic Beasts was a little fluffy. I liked the tone, I liked the pacing and the backstories. I liked the expositions of new characters. I am super interested to learn more about how Nagini's story will her to being the right hand man of Voldemort. I felt like a couple lines were forced, such as \"Grindelwald doesn't value that which is simple.\" I get that it was a recall to what Dumbledore says about Voldemort to Harry, but I felt like there was no motivation for that line since Newt would've had no reason to say this based on Newt's experiences with Grindelwald. There were some interesting things that could potentially set up some plot holes in the Potterverse. And I would say that I am not worried at all, but Cursed Child made plenty of mistakes in terms of plot direction that cheapened or poked holes in the Potterverse.I actually like Grindelwald movie version more than Voldemort movie version (book version is a different story), he seems more sophisticated and his motives more reasonable.Overall, I liked the tone. And felt encouraged by this installment. It seems to be following the Potter series in that it improves with each installment. I just really hope she does not poke holes in timelines, or plot points.."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "The Crimes of Grindelwald is the latest in the ever expanding universe of J.K.

The main gripe with the film is that, technically speaking, the film never actually accomplishes anything. The movie ends where it began, there is no progress.

There's a decent cast present, with Jude Law and Johnny Depp among them, plus of course Eddie Redmayne as Newt Scamander. I enjoyed his performance and found it a quite watchable and indeed entertaining film, even though I can't say I fully followed the ins and outs of every plot aspect but that doesn't always entirely matter. From what I've seen, a lot of people weren't much impressed with this film due to the plot being a bit scatter-brained. This didn't overly bother me, as I say and I did enjoy the special effects, although sometimes its more of an issue, such as with full out action films, if the main plot seems utterly implausible then it can put me off the whole film, though I really enjoyed watching this film. It's a nice enough form of escapism and so I'd recommend it for that purpose, although I'm not sure I'd say its better than the first film, its certainly not bad at all. Its surprisingly engrossing really and the CGI creatures have a real charm to them, so I felt, its just not a film to overly analyse or take especially seriously I suppose.

The CGI looks great but it's overdone - you feel as though you're being led from one over the top set piece to the next. I'm not crazy about the Harry Potter universe (unlike the people I went with) so a lot of what went on was very confusing. This isn't the film to see if you're not familiar with the franchise.

Another thing that annoyed me while watching is that the script paints the magic and the spells to be way more elaborate and way more advanced than the magic depicted in the Harry Potter series, which is supposed to take place around 60 years later.

Not the biggest of fan boys but I definitely have a lot of respect for the series and only want to see it presented in the best light. In my opinion this movie while beautifully done lacked in its ability to develop and present a fluid story. To keep things simple here's what I enjoyed about the film. First this film didn't focus too heavily on the magical creatures like it did in the previous installment. I felt like the first movie relied much to heavily on cute/weird creatures to give a reason of interest to the audience. This time around a decently clear story line was first presented with showing Grindelwald and him being the bad guy. I loved the sets and visuals as well as the characters who were all fairly interesting. Ok... so now the bad. It seems like who ever wrote the script said to hell with a coherent story, lets fill this piece of crap up with as much convoluted story material as possible. Even the beautiful scenery and interesting places the characters go cannot distract one from constantly wondering where did such and such come from or how did she or he get here? Why are the characters here? so on and so forth.. Weird sub plots and characters popping in and out made watching this movie extremely difficult to watch at times. One example is Comma's eye parasite or whatever. The movie clearly eludes to him having some sort of problem with his eye....ok cool. As the story goes on we see him mess with it and take eye drops and such. It finally comes down to him passing out randomly and the main characters pull some squigly creature out of his eye. This part has no meaning to the movie as a whole and I was personally left wondering how did he get the parasite why did they put so much effort in showing us all this information?This is just one example where you're left scratching your head wondering what was the point. I can name 3 other parts of the film with the same head scratching confusion as this example. In summary just wait till the movie hits red box. Its worth renting not paying a crazy movie ticket price to view."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Pros: Good acting, gorgeous visuals, beautiful score.

Eddie Redmayne was still excellent as Newt but I think he did a better job in the first film.

But I did really like Jude Law as a younger Dumbledor and Joshua Shea who plays young Newt. Joshua played younger NEwt so well that he actually looked like a younger version of Eddie. Jude Law brought the same kind of attitude towards Dumbledor that we all know and love. The special effects and set designs still looked marvellous. The creatures special effects just like last time were great and looked like if we saw them in real life that\u2019s what they would look like. The sets looked directly like they got taken directly out of a history book. Now with this film being a sequel, you would think they would fix the problems they had in the last film but for this one, they didn\u2018t. The main thing that bugged me was Johnny Depp. He didn\u2019t do a good job of playing the main villain. It could be because of the writing or just because of his acting. Next is all of the subplots. I counted there are around four of them. But seeing how I couldn\u2019t really figure out the main plot one of those subplots could have been the main plot. The last thing is the pacing in this film. Some scenes just seemed like the plot stopped for this one scene that could have just been taken out. The entire film felt really slow and only in the action scenes did it seem to pick up.

Rowling\u2019s magical world as unbiased a viewing as was possible, considering the scathing reviews, I would like to submit my own take on the film.  I am neither a professional film critic nor a particularly rabid fan of the Harry Potter universe; however, I enjoyed this film for the reasons that any patient reader will discover below.As a film, this story had only four goals: The Scheherazade goal, the Empire Strikes back goal, the revelation of familial heritage goal (also present in Empire Strikes Back), and the retrieval of a powerful, sacred object goal.  In those goals this film succeeded and did so in an exciting, suspenseful, and entertaining fashion.As the reader may recall, Scheherazade is the fictional narrator of the Arabian Nights tales who craftily kept herself from being cut in half the morning after her wedding night (and for 1,000 nights thereafter) by telling her husband stories and leaving off with a cliff-hanger before drifting off to sleep each night.  Rowling and Yates have to avoid the literary executioner\u2019s block by keeping us involved and excited about what is going to happen next.  They accomplished this goal in two short scenes at that end of the film.We all remember the shock of the Empire Strikes Back, our hero\u2019s decent into Hell, the rise of the victorious bad guys, and the defeat of the forces of good.  This is a standard trope that adds a little bit of realism to an otherwise fantastical \u201cgood always triumphs over evil\u201d boring story.  We see evil triumph all the time in the real world; and to lend a little of this realism to a story gives it a scent of veracity to the tale and keeps us hanging on to see the end.  Despite this shout out to realism and the reference to the ugly reality of two world wars, this is not a Twentieth Century post-modern realism story.  It is rather a Nineteenth Century heroic fantasy on the scale of The Prisoner of Zenda (just as Star Wars was).  We all know that good will triumph in the end, it is just the details of how that triumph is achieved that hold our interest.  Admittedly, the Dumbledore character is Homeric in its origins, a somewhat tragic, conflicted character of ambiguous means versus ends motivations and deep scars from past regrets.  Fans who wish that Albus Dumbledore would just settle in as a kind, avuncular mentor and protector miss a depth that Homer gave all his heroes and villains.  Long before post-modern authors thought they invented it, Homer recognized that people are complicated and heroic motivations often ambiguous.  Let us not be confused here, Newt Scamander is not the hero of this story.  The hero is Albus Dumbledore.This brings us to the retrieval of the powerful and sacred object: The blood-oath amulet that the Niffler steals from Grindelwald and which Newt returns to Dumbledore.  This is the talisman that prevents Dumbledore from confronting Grindelwald directly (and explains why he had pursued that confrontation through surrogates heretofore).  This is a Samson\u2019s Hair type of device.  It makes Dumbledore vulnerable, much like Achilles\u2019 heel or Superman\u2019s Kryptonite, which is necessary because a perfectly invulnerable hero is boring.  However, there has been established by the late reveal in the movie another chink in Dumbledore\u2019s armor.  This chink is the true identity of Creedence Barebone as one Aurelias Dumbledore.The reveal of the true heritage served several narrative purposes.  Firstly, it relieved a tension that had been built during the entire film regarding Creedence\u2019s true identity.  Secondly, the reveal provided a cliff-hanger to keep fans interested in the next installment.  Most importantly, it heaped on the Kryptonite for Dumbledore.  He may be in possession of the blood-oath amulet that he may or may not be able to destroy, but there is now another very powerful shield between him and Grindelwald and their final battle.The next three films will no doubt be about how that shield is breached, as well as other minor fan service narrative devices about reuniting Jacob and Queenie, throwing Newt and Tina together despite themselves, and solving all the apparent continuity errors Rowling teased.This was a well-crafted effort, not without editing errors.  It succeeded in making me want to see the next chapter."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Visuals were simply amazing, Jude Law does a good job as Dumbledore. We find out more about the Potterverse and the menagerie of magical creatures grows by a lot. They did a good job making them all seem unique and interesting. I'd personally have liked to see more of the Japanese Kappa. The gang from the first Fantastic Beasts movie is back and it's a blast. Not only new beasts and characters, but also new magic we've not seen before. I feel the score of the movie could have been better, but the original from the Potter movies are hard to live up to. It kept me interested the whole way though. It felt like less time had passed than actually had at the end of the movie, which only happens when i'm really sucked into a movie."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Me siento un poco abrumado por las malas cr\u00edticas, puesto que Animales Fant\u00e1sticos: Los Cr\u00edmenes de Grindelwald cumple con ser entretenida, los personajes est\u00e1n ok, tiene escenas viscerales y la historia tiene buena cadencia y mantiene su ritmo pese a que algunas veces parece perderse y no tener pies ni cabeza.
