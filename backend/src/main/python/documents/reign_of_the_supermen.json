Meanwhile, Superman's death has also signaled to the universe that Earth is vulnerable.

What results is a film that is reeeeaaalllyyy hit-and-miss.On the plus side: There is some very nice character work. This is really Lois Lane's film as she compellingly both deals with grief and investigates the new Supermen. Liked the heroes Steel, a decent every-guy, and Superboy. They go with the classic nineties shades and leather jacket Superboy, and oh how I've missed him, constantly trying to show off and being a self-appointed ladies man.No complaints about the fight scenes here. There is also a visually unique method to create a portal device that I applaud the writers for.A couple of funny lines in this as well.On the negative side: The film suffers from trying to fit the four Supermen, who had multiple issues to develop themselves in the original comics, into 87 minutes. Steel and Eradicator, especially the latter, get the short shrift in the plot department.I wish they hadn't set this in the animated DC film universe. With the little amount of time available, it felt the use of preexisting elements and teasing developments for later ones pulled focus.Waaaaayyyy too much time is spent on Lex Luthor, who really just had a minimal role in the original comic story line. To make matters worse, the character is basically a check-off list of predictable Lex Luthor storyline tropes. You could make a drinking game out of it. I felt Rainn Wilson to be one of the weakest Luthor performers.The whole plot does reek of poor planning altogether, Mercy Graves, who served as someone for Lex to talk to in The Death of Superman (and to be honest they didn't really need her as he has another lackey) is waylaid very early in the film as it's clear they didn't know what to do with her.For a movie that is about the hope and goodness that Superman represents, there are a couple moments in the movie that are way more dark than they need to be. They feel unearned and took me out of the film. There is one scene at the very end after the big cliimax, which was just uber nihilistic.The animation is okay in this but not the best.Overall, I guess I liked this more than I didn't, but it's not a movie I'm planning to revisit."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Chafa la historia, solo el super boy y el superman de gafas son los mejores.
