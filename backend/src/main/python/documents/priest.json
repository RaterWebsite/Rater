This is definitely one of those movies you instantly see and know it could have been better if not for its restrictions with its pg-13 rating. In the obnoxious current vampire craze, this takes a different direction and its welcomed in my opinion. Being based on a graphic novel helps, no twilight influences here. The beginning doesn't drag on, it spends just enough time on the character development and gets going. Parts are cheesy and some dialogue is corny, but the most part, it's worth seeing. I didn't care for the way it ended, its not terrible, but it could have been done a lot better. If your on edge, probably see it in a budget theater or rent it, you won't be missing too much."

      "text": "All is not quiet at the Catholic Holy Cross Cemetery. Somebody get a priest. On second thought, don't. That's what has John Ford rolling in his grave to begin with. It's the breach in the fine line between homage and ripoff. The sacreligiousity at work here is two-fold. The filmmaker manages to upset both Christians and cineastes in equal proportions. The \"Legion\" director, whose funny idea of the holy spirit in his 2009 debut was that God would send down a battalion of homicidal angels to zombify the masses with an ecclesiastical opiate, has moved on from ripping off a B-movie classic like George Romero's \"Night of the Living Dead\". Now, in his not-so-infinite wisdom, he's raiding the film canon for ideas. In \"Priest\", the filmmakers takes \"The Searchers\" template and replaces the cowboys and Indians with clergymen and vampires, then sets their ongoing hostilities toward each other in a dystopian world where the Catholic church functions as a totalitarian regime. The all-powerful monsignors, a group of theological autocrats, who preside over the God-fearing masses in these walled-up cities, use Orwellian-like methods of mind control to neutralize the priests, whom the church disbanded after the vampire menace was deemed to be over. Taking a cue from Sam Peckinpah's \"Ride the High Country\", the priest(Paul Bettany), no longer a useful member of society(the marginalized vampires are tucked away on reservations), is reduced to shoveling coal for a living, a humiliating job, similar to the cowboy Westrum in the 1962 film, who runs a rigged carnival game out of desperation. (Alas, Peckinpah was cremated and had his ashes scattered at sea.) Unlike Ethan Edwards(John Wayne), the priest never returns home to be among the kinfolk. That's probably because he still covets his brother's wife, Shannon. The child they bore together prior to his leaving for the clergy is a dead giveaway; the child whom Hicks and the priest with no name are now searching for. Fate. You can't run away from it. By roaming the city all those years like a vagabond, the priest avoids the sexual tension that Ethan faces when he finally succumbs to love and returns home to see Martha Edwards, still married to his brother Aaron. In the film's iconic first shot, when Martha opens the door, framing the outback in its opening, you notice her hands, first the left, then the right, gripping the house itself to steady herself as she makes her way outside. In that instant, she's not a mother and wife; she's a woman in love, struggling to remember her vows. While Ethan approaches the homestead, Martha does something very subtle with her hand that hints at the desire which belies her blue dress and white apron get-up. Before she straightens her fingers to block out the glare of the sun, they're arranged at the forehead in such a way that suggests she's about to faint. It's not the heat; this conservative frontier woman is swooning. When Ethan chastely kisses her forehead, she closes her eyes. Meanwhile, the Confederate Army hero isn't thinking straight either. The cowboy mistakes Debbie for Lucy, despite the girls being at least ten years apart in age. That's anguish. He wants to turn back the years. Because of \"Priest\", with its similar but different relationship dynamic between Ethan/Priest and Martha/Shannon, perhaps, a shared sexual past, and not unrequited love, is the correct interpretation for Ethan's stolen glances and the way Martha gently smooths her brother-in-law's military coat. Maybe, just maybe, the identically named Lucy is Ethan's daughter. Now the scene where Ethan and Martha's hands briefly touch as they both reach for a lantern becomes more ambiguous. Aaron, who is storing money away while this display of subtle intimacy takes place, rather than being oblivious to his wife's slight marital indiscretion, may possibly know, and accepts their muted flirtation, but chooses to look the other way. In \"Priest\", Owen knows that the child isn't his. Evidence of a sexual past can be gleaned from the scene in which Ethan stabs the soil(vagina) with his knife(penis), a metaphorical remembrance, perhaps, of the night he and Martha conceived Lucy, whose denuded lifeless body the war hero discovers in the cave. \"Don't ever ask me MORE,\" Ethan tells Brad, later on, when Lucy's boyfriend mistakes a squaw for his betrothed. \"More\", filtered through \"Priest\", suddenly becomes a loaded word. Whereas Ethan's love for Martha outweighs his hatred for the Indians as the determining deterrent against killing Debbie, a converted Comanche, in \"Priest\", Hicks(the stand-in for Martin), Lucy's protector, probably knows that vampire infection isn't the sole reason for the potentiality of the father committing fratricide. He broke his vow of celibacy. The timeline is a mere technicality. Now he must atone, murderously. Does the priest love God more than his daughter? Thankfully, no."

The plot, in a nutshell, are combat trained priest who kill vampires. One priest goes against his vows to save someone special from a mysterious enemy. I'm not familiar with the source material but this was good enough for the style of movie. I first give my kudos to the directing style. The movie moves at a perfect pace by focusing on the action but slowing just enough to give the audience insight into the characters. Action sequences really stand out and pretty violent for PG-13. The characters aren't very deep but just right for this movie. Also the dialogue never gets preachy or sappy just for the sake of it. This film is just what it should be and i fully recomened it."

The bad guys could have been anything in this movie - another race, zombies, etc.  This movie does not delve into the history or complexity of vampires, it is simply a shoot-em-up good guy against bad guy movie.  It is predictable and there is nothing new in the story telling.  I have to give props for the overall look of the movie, however.  I liked the dark, sepia look of the film, and the CGI looks good.  At first I was taken aback because there was no female love interest, which is mandatory for a Hollywood film these days, but sure enough the woman shows up halfway through.  As it turns out, she is probably the best actor and most interesting character in the film.  The ending sets up a sequel, but I don't think it garnered enough ticket sales for that.  We'll see."

It's meant to be awesome, and it is. Another guy on here was talking about Hollywood taking rated R movies and making them PG13 (which makes them horrible normally-I definitely agree)...I think this movie is the exeption to that PG13 is censored R rule. Priest is not a movie that feels like it was forced into being PG13 and I remember being worried about it sucking because it is pg13. I mean the movies' main character is a priest...it's not like there's going to be a lot of sex and 'bad' words...the violence is bloody, not gory.I was not at all disappointed. I love this movie so much. I came....To see a vampire movie and I got one with bits of satire and references to old western movies. The cinematography was awesome- the colors, the angles, the composition- beautiful. The fight scenes ruled. The cgi wasn't overdone. The violence was tasteful. The storyline was interesting and original. The style of the wardrobes and the environment gave subtle reference to the Final Fantasy/steam punk styles and it worked out really well. I don't normally write reviews... I really wish I'd get paid for this (because I'm spending a lot of time writing reviews about this movie)... But this movie was so good that I decided I would write one...and after I saw what critics were saying about this movie I've basically begun a campaign to let people know that this is in fact a bad@as movie. This is now in my top 3 favorite movies: 28 days later, The Matrix (the first one), Priest.Go see it, and don't let any of these reviews (including this one) effect what you think of it. If you like my top three, you like vampires, you like genre-benders and you don't need sex in a movie to think it's good, then you will like/love this flick."

Priest is based on a series of Graphic Novels. What I like about this movie is the fact that the vampires aren't really normal. They're like savage animals and much more monstrous than the average ones you see in Twilight who in my opinion aren't proper vampires at all. But anyway let's get to the acting. The acting wasn't too bad but it wasn't really good either. It was just average and good enough for a film like Priest. Paul Bettany's and Maggie Q's performances stood out compared to everybody elses but apart from that nothing much. The story was pretty good. Priests vs. Vampires and all that stuff. It was pretty good. The action sequences and the effects were awesome so if you want to see the film just for the effects (but why would someone do that?) you can. And you won't be disappointed. So I'll just round that all up and give Priest an 8/10 for Paul Bettany's performance and effects but the acting could have been better. This is Mewtwo465 saying goodbye."

This becomes obvious whenever someone else walks into the scene, whether it is Karl Urban, Cam Gigandet or Maggie Q. Not notable names by any means, but they yank away the camera regardless.\r The priest character lacks that something that marks a hero or anti-hero. What there is buried under a layer of coldness that never gets thawed as there is nobody who can do the thawing. There is no romantic interest or a substitute. If it was meant for us to pity the plight of a priest who is cast aside by a church that has no use for vampire slayers because it believes the vampire tamed, than it didn't work for I could care less about this ice-cold person.\r The weakness of the central character is all the more a problem because original isn't a word that we can apply to the plot or the setting. The creators ransacked other stories, movies and worlds of their tropes and fused them together with little originality. So there are cities in perpetual shadows, under the autocratic boot heels of a theocracy on one side and the vast expanses, mostly desert, of the free living(free in squalor that is) in a 19th century western frontier setting. So it is a cowboys mixed with cyberpunk, spiced with a tad of Mad Max and topped off with a wacky horror story.\r The vampires in look like demons and their helpers, called familiars, look like goblins. The vampires can't stand sunlight, which should make it easy to dispose of them, but nobody figured out that they could use mirrors to send sunlight down into their hideouts. At some point the vampire transport themselves by use of a train that can been dealt with by destroying the tracks or shooting holes in the train during the day. One of the heroes even uses this as a tactic at some time. But the story won't allow this: it would be too easy.\r Ridiculous is also the reason for the existence of this priest cult. Priests using hand to hand combat are established as superior fighters to people armed with machine guns, which makes you wonder why we don't send our soldiers on karate lessons.\r Weak is also the vampire background story. It is painted as a conflict of interest between two different races, but the vampires in this movie are just mindless ravenous demons whose only connection with reason is hard to find. A conflict interest there might be, but how one can get to the idea that mindless monsters could have been tamed is never made clear in the movie. It is totally nonsensical that the church assumes priest redundant.\r The movie is slightly saved by the main bad guy and the support cast, who do their best with a movie rife with cliches, tropes and bad story telling elements. We have seen this all before and done a lot better.\rTotally forgettable."

VFX by the guy was a VFX supervisor on Blade Runner and Iron Man and John Wick 4?  Where this and various Underworld movies go off track is TONE.  The tone is merely bombastic.  NOBODY LEARNS ANYTHING.  So no character arcs at all."

      "text": "\"Priest\" is exactly what you'd expect it to be - a blood-infested, action-packed, testosterone-charged action fest. That does not necessarily mean it's bad, it's just typical. It follows a rather linear story, with bad dialogue (very machoist, many a times) and some bad visual effects. For a change, however, it does show vampires as not the over-sexualised, highly intelligent beings, but as brute alien like monsters, which was somewhat refreshing. The film is also surprisingly short with only 1 hour and 20 minutes - definitely could have been longer. Well, if it had been better, it could have been longer. The way it is now, though, 1:20 is perfectly fine. I don't even know what to say. Yes, it's entertaining, but it won't leave you with wanting any more than what you've been given. The ending does provide for a perfect (intentionally so) setup for a sequel, that due to horrible reviews and box office will never be made. The films biggest flaw is its poor screenplay, but that might be a fault of the original comic book too, which I have never read before. In general, the film was overly predictable and not very exciting, though reasonably entertaining. Going into it you won't find anything that you haven't seen in films like this before, but you won't be completely disappointed either. If you are looking for what I've described in the first sentence, you'll definitely get that. If you are looking for some genre changer, you will be severely disappointed."

First, let's set the back story: the year is 2017 when the Catholic church, in an attempt to make young children more...available, begins to create their own stock of humans, genetically engineered to have super-sucking abilities. Everything is well and good until these creations become self-aware, and turn into vampires (naturally). In any case, it's a wonderful morality play, and it's got everything you want: trains, vampires, wastelands, and that albino from The Da Vinci Code. 10/10, go see Priest."

The ending is a damp squid and I am struggling to find another movie where an evil foe was defeated so easily. Although left open for a sequel hopefully everybody will decide to do the world a favour and leave this in the bargain bin section where it belongs."

I only watched it for karl Urban, and he thankfully came out of this smelling of roses even with his cheesy bounty hunter style vampire, unfortunately the rest is quite bleak and feels a missed opportunity."

Is this his companion piece to Legion (which was a slightly better film)? I can't say I was thrilled, excited, or even mildly interested in what was going on on-screen. This film is just tired and and it tries too hard and I found myself asking, \"Is it over yet?\""

      "text": "Here's my attempt at a non-biased review. The movie overall was not good. One of the things that erked me the most was the main character. For one the actor was not what you'd call a good choice. Don't get me wrong he wasn't bad, but he did not fit. A skinny little white guy with a cross  on his face is going to save the world from a vampire threat? Ewwww not going to fly. Plus, lets also add in that his fight seens really weren't to immaculate. Yes, he did kill vampires in various ways which was pretty cool, but then at the end when he had to fight the main bad guy he just got **** up. He really got **** up. Now im aware that he is only a vampire killer and he should only do well against vampires, that in and of itself destroys the badass thing that the movie was going for. Yeah he's pretty cool fighting **** that he knows how to kill and that he can kill easily, but when it comes something a little bit stronger he just gets destroyed. There was no improv from his part he justs get beaten up and then saved by the girl priest. Not very badass......at all. So the writing for the main character could have been much better and then they definately needed a new actor, I'd say vin diesel, or \"The Rock\" or maybe Jason Statham or someone along those lines.\rOn to the next thing. The whole idea of the Priest(In the movie) was pathetic. They had no special ability, no magic power, no trick up their sleeve, nothing. They were just some people who were basically ninjas but with the word priest not ninja. This was probably what **** the movie the most for me. The priests weren't special in any way. They just had some cool blades and some hoods(Which they never **** wore!). I mean the whole idea doesn't make sense. I understand it is a movie and it doesn't need to be completely reallistic, but this to me crossed the line. You mean to tell me trained soldiers with rifles that can kill vampires just as easy as the priests little daggers couldn't handle the vampire threat? \"Well you saw, the vampires were hard to shoot\" No Hicks **** blows straight up. He was useless the entire time, maybe killed 5 vampires or so and then did nothing else the entire movie. My point is, they gave no reason for priests to be needed. They had nothing special the just were quick and used daggers. Thats it! They needed to have some special thing like they were taken at a pure age which gave them the ability to combat the vampires, or God came down and imbued them with the ability to be able to fight them, or they had magical abilities that they could use.( No, I haven't read the **** novel, all of this is based off the movie, so if they're special in the novel then im sorry.) But as far as im concerned I could have taken a civilian from the movie trained him how to shoot and be quick and he could've done a **** ton better than the priests.\rThe final thing that I didn't like was the vampires themselves. No it's not because they weren't like twilight, or 'cause they werent handsome and elegant, or cause they were just feral beasts or stupid **** like that. No thats not it at all. The writer can make the vampire whatever the **** he wants its all up to his imagination they dont need to be anything, in fact I like how he did it, as far as I know it was unique it didn't follow twilight or blade or all the bull****. The one thing that they did was that the vampires did not live up to the story in the beginning. And that's my only problem. In the legend they **** ripped people to shreds and split them in half and pretty much mutilated humans. Now dont get me wrong im not a bloodthirsty gore**** idiot, i dont need movies to be bloody and gorey to be good. But when in the **** opening they are ripping people to shreds and then in the movie he sees his brother after the attack and he has a scratch on his face, i ask myself what the **** happened. Did they just dumb down or something what is this.\rSo all in all the movie made no **** sense(Vampire reservations was a big one, not gonna get into that), nothing lived up to what it was supposed to(Priests were lame, Main character sucked, Vampires were about as brutal as a pack of puppies, and the main guy who took a **** cross-blade to the throat and was fine died to an explosion which was **** lame), It had a lot of useless characters(Hicks is the biggest **** one, jesus christ I would have rather had the **** asian kid from Indiana Jones there. At least he never threatened Indie with a gun.) And then the cast was just **** The main character was about as badass as a girlscout, the other girl priest was, for lack of a better term, ugly, the main bad guy actor was the best i thought). All in all, Priest was not good at all, waste of time, waste of money, dont watch it."

The quality of the world that was created was passable albeit a mash-up of Blade-Runner, Dune, and any given western.The character development was very lacking and we only got a surface treatment of who we think the characters should be. The biggest problem wasn't the actor's(except the sheriff),  it was when I left the theater I felt that I just payed in full and only watched half a movie."

I do not understand the excessive criticism, ok it wasn't wholly originl but so what ? For the worst thing is that the film doesn't really end. It is clear they set you up for a sequel one cannot but feeling cheated as you prepare for war the entire film and it all ends after one battle. Also what's with the low certificate ? This is not stuff meant for children, they should live the film as the filmaker intended it and stick a 15 certificate as a minimum, 18 even better. I hope they do Priest 2 as there's much to explore and to improve. I do not think it's worth a 10 but neither a 2 ! What kind of vote is 2 ? This movie is no disaster, yes it's borrows elements everywhere but so do other accepted hits, it merely needed more time and maybe a better cut. Karl Urban and Paul Bettany are good as usual."

      "text": "I really didn't know what to expect with this movie. As soon as the movie began to play my eye instantly caught the aesthetic style of the world that this movie painted, and the back story that set the film's plot up was decent to boot. The CGI was decent and the acting wasn't terrible. The movie opened with the tale of a war with vampires and special warriors called priests tasked with stopping the vamps. After the vampire threat was long thought diminished they begin to return. After this interesting set-up the film shifts it's plot to more of a rescue mission. it completely loses the scope that it sets up at the beginning of the film and ends with a very lackluster climax that is unfortunately forgettable, which is pretty much what I'd say about the whole film itself. The story just didn't pan out very well ant the cool art direction was ditched after the first fifteen minutes of the movie, They had a really cool noire looking city in the middle of the desert and we barley got to see any of it. This movie could have been so much more, well at least the vampires didn't sparkle..."
