After an incident at home, his secret past bubbles up and he goes on a violent rampage, revealing his special set of lethal skills. As revenge flicks go, this one has its share of kills, but without anything new\u2026just lots of careening cars, hard hits and bullseye gunshots. Since there\u2019s an accomplished actor in the lead, he gets the opportunity for a dramatic nod or two. The premise borders on absurd and tasks credibility, but some people might enjoy watching him ferociously kick many asses."

It posses scenes somewhat copied from The Mechanic, The Transportor, etc. And everything copied from John Wick, just the plot is different and very few scenes are left to be copied.Everyone compares It with John Wick. But John Wick has a whole different Legendary taste. Nobody has a past mystery of his being feared by some of them who knows him. And another mystery is of that cards tattoo on his wrist, Nothing much, The Storyline is decent but the length of the movie concerns much just in one and half hour and less if we cut intro and outro of the movie. This movie is a one-time show you watch and let it go.  There's no much to exaggerate about the details of the movie or to focus on character as movie doesn't offer much to the character other than like a John Wick past mystery. So it's not much amazing while watching the movie. One can while seeing the movie all time think that this was the scene in John Wick and that wasn't\". Nothing much"

Thrust forth by an impeccably game Bob Odenkirk and held together with stylish direction and enthralling choreography, I'd be hard pressed to say that I've seen another action movie within the past few years that's surprised me more. You also have to appreciate it when an action movie commits to utilizing inventive action sequences throughout. Leave it to the \"John Wick\" franchise's Derek Kolstad to keep things lively and vibrant on that front as well (no pencils to be found in this, however). In the end, would I mind another one of these? Not at all, actually! I'd honestly be happy to see it!"

      "text": "This movie sucks big time. But first, know that the movie is competently made. Lots of violence and crazy action. My problem with this movie is that it feels like one long buildup for a punchline that never comes. Basically, Bob Odenkirk feels emasculated, so he turns to senseless violence at an increasing rate of scale and absurdity. The action got so silly that I became disengaged and uninterested. The plot was so poorly constructed that it felt dreamlike, which destroyed the sense that anything was really at stake, which caused all the action to feel hollow and tedious. At one point the movie itself gets bored with the action and speeds things up with a quick montage of him storming some Russian mafia place and killing hordes of baddies. The story got so nutty that I expected them to reveal that Odenkirk was merely imagining himself as a badass ex-hitman as an escape from the feeling of emasculation. As much as I hate the \"it was all a dream\" trope, it was the only way I could see this movie making sense. But that doesn't happen. Things just get more and more and more stupid until the very end. Like, given the good reviews and the fact that Bob Odenkirk is in it, I thought this movie might actually be good. But I was wrong. This movie sucks big time."

As a matter of fact, I liked this movie so much more than entire current three chapters of Wick put together. A \u201cstyle\u201d over \u201csubstance\u201d argument can be made because of that. I also felt that, setting aside his character name is Hutch, \u201cNobody\u201d is a much more relatable movie because the lead character\u2019s life and how that is interestingly portrayed at the start. It\u2019s not a perfect movie. There is only one character that has any story arc and development. That\u2019s not a problem as Hutch is very well fleshed out by Bob Odenkirk, but the real clich\u00e9 here was the way this was edited. The filming, framing, lighting etc. was fine, but the fast cuts at the top of the film stand out as not being necessary. It was somewhat confusing and did add the the doldrum of the leads hum drum life. I also would have loved to have actual source music cues backing the action when the antagonist was singing the last time. Andy Williams is a good choice, but comes off as an artistic choice that other films have already made and this film is trying to match. I also like this \u201cworld\u201d a little more than other mentioned action films as it felt much more grounded. That\u2019s a strange thing to say with all the murders that happen on screen. It\u2019s very violent and has more gore then an average action flick, but it left me with a highly charged sense that I will be watching it again soon. I\u2019d recommend it for anyone who likes explosions and the idea of a mobile mobster 401k."

      "text": "Nobody (2021) is directed by Ilya Naishuller, director of Hardcore Henry, and written by Derek Kolstad who also wrote the first 3 John Wick movies.  David Leitch is also the producer of this and also directed the John Wick series. Seeing who worked on this gave me an expectation of fun and exciting action sequences similar to that of John Wick. The premise is \"Hutch Mansell fails to defend himself or his family when two thieves break into his suburban home one night. The aftermath of the incident soon strikes a match to his long-simmering rage. In a barrage of fists, gunfire and squealing tires, Hutch must now save his wife and son from a dangerous adversary -- and ensure that he will never be underestimated again\". So does Nobody (2021) live up to my expectations or fail miserably?Firstly, Bob Odenkirk gives a great performance as the main character, Hutch Mansell. Bob Odenkirk doesn't look like an action star, no offence, so he perfectly fits the mundane and plain character of Hutch. He is perfect in really making it seem like this guy is really \"nobody\" special. However, when it is time for Hutch to become a super badass, Bob Odenkirk somehow manages to convince the audience that this bland and unimpressive guy is actually able to kick your ass. It feels completely natural and believable. He also does every stunt and it definitely shows. I also have to praise Christopher Lloyd as David Mansell, Hutch's father, as he is playing a role that you wouldn't expect from that actor.The action scenes are as exciting as you would expect. One thing about the action sequences that sets it apart from John Wick is that he isn't perfect and actually gets beaten up a lot. John Wick feels like a superhero and there is never really a feeling that he is actually in danger. In Nobody (2021) it honestly feels like Hutch is vulnerable and that his old age is making him weaker to his opponents to a certain extent. It gives a sense of danger and makes it feel like Hutch could potentially die which I appreciate. Additionally, the tone of this is a lot more comedic and this works well. I did get quite a fair bit of chuckle from certain scenes and it definitely gives a breather from all the murder. Nevertheless, Nobody (2021) feels way too much of a carbon copy of John Wick. There is an action scene where the bad guys invade the main characters home, there is the unfortunate mishap of the bad guys robbing the wrong persons home, there is the main lead coming out of retirement because they did something unforgivable, there is the people being scared of his reputation moment, there is him getting help from friends from old times, there is an evil Russian group that feels beat for beat from John Wick. It just feels kind of lazy and definitely doesn't do anything groundbreaking.The story and characters also lack a lot of polish. I don't end up caring about any of the characters because they don't spend enough time developing them including the main character. They sprinkle in some flashbacks or conversation about the main character that gives a sort of understanding why he is a badass but they don't explore any of the supporting characters. Nobody (2021) begins with him and his wife's relationship being trouble but why? Hutch has a half brother and his dad who appears but we don't get a complete understanding about their relationship either. Nobody (2021) needed 10 more minutes of runtime to explore this. The main Russian villain is just so generic as well that it is kind of disappointing. Overall, I wanted a fun action movie and that's exactly what I got. It didn't surprise me or anything and I feel like it was quite a forgettable movie by the end. However, I had a great time with its 90-minute runtime and I still would love a sequel. Heck I would even love for it to become a part of the John Wick universe and have Hutch meet John Wick. Bob Odenkirk is the biggest reason to give this a watch thanks to his amazing performance and stunt work."
