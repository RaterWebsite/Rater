      "text": "Alright, unlike with Spider-Man 3, this time I actually agree with the critics. What a disappointment Shrek The Third was. The first movie was a brilliant and charming spoof of Disney cartoons and fairy tales and was really fun for anyone, even older audiences. Shrek 2 left a little bit of that behind but still delivered a great and charming movie for all audiences. Maybe it's the loss of series director Andrew Adamson (who is now working on the Narnia series) but Shrek The Third feels different from the first 2 almost immediately, and not in a good way. Almost immediately, the humor feels forced, and the movie almost seems to be aimed at a much younger audience than the first 2. This movie is so tame and sugary, in fact, that it often ended up feeling just like the Disney movies the series was originally spoofing. This becomes even more clear when a \"message\" is blatently delivered to the audience at the end of the movie. The plot is entirely mediocre, Donkey and Puss seem to have nothing to do, (and the filmmakers, as if realizing this, half-heartedly threw in a pointless character switch, I guess in a failed attempt to keep these characters interesting) and Shrek himself is really just a boring character this time around. Although this movie is definitely aiming only for the kiddies (whereas the first 2 Shrek movies were definitely for all audiences) some attempts at \"adult jokes\" and out-of-place licensed rock music was halfheartedly thrown into the movie and feels entirely out of place. Yes, there are a couple funny moments here, but they were almost all given away in the trailers and commercials. (I hate it when they do that.) Much of the humor felt very forced, and even the audience I saw this in (which contained plenty of little kids) let plenty of jokes fall flat. (Although they enjoyed all the fart jokes thrown in at the end of the movie.) Of course the animation is very nice, and as I said, a couple jokes hit and are pretty funny, but there's really no reason to see this. What a disappointment. The makers of these movies have completely forgotten why these movies were made to begin with and what we ended up here was a boring, mostly un-funny, and very forced mess."

With its pop culture references trying so hard to bring humor in to the film, \"Shrek the Third\" feels very hectic at times, with very tiring jokes that have trouble attaining much laughter. The plot feels like trying to bring new ideas and concept, but failing despite these efforts, and becoming a similar rehash of its previous films that doesn't work this time. Their formula to add humor to heart doesn't exceed this time, and leaves audiences wondering that if they should call it quits (but of course, there is a Shrek Forever After)."

Es una pena que no respetaran el mismo estilo \"comedia para todo publico\". Ok lo admito, si el guion fuera excelente, no habr\u00eda problema, pero es tan rid\u00edculo y se siente tan forzado que da pena. \u00bfFue el cambio de director? no tengo idea, pero lamentablemente, Shrek 3 es horrible."

It lacks the wit and comedy that made the first entries comical, and the story feels lazy, and more like a direct to video cash-grab Disney sequel than a Shrek movie. It also had too many characters; too many to keep track of.\r However, it DID have its redeeming qualities, such as the character of Merlin (excellently voiced by Eric Idle).\r In short, this bland threequel should have been better developed, or, better yet, never made."

I mean, it had problems like some of the jokes are not funny, the Shrek's Nightmare and Ginger-man Past doesn't make seances and the villain is really unnecessary, but the animation is good, the characters are okay (Except for the princess who are really funny and great characters), the story is okay and the jokes are funny. But if there is something I can agree with all the others, is that this film is the lowest of the others Shrek movies.\rIt's just that I didn't find out too bad in my case. Still, I recommend in if there's a necessary case."

Considering the content emotional state of its protagonists there was little place to take both the story and its passe post-modern ironic jabs at pop and Disney culture. Murphy's voice is only an exploited extension of his hilarious work as the Klump family in 'The Nutty Professor.' Banderas's charm as 'Puss' is negated by monotonous character jokes as well as a poor second-act twist that makes the film increasingly grating. The plot hinges on 'Arthur' and Timberlake imbues him with a whiny, effete personality that is less than winning. He also appears incapable of reciting his dialogue with any double-entendres or meanings as everything sounds like he's reading from a kids book to a five year old audience. The film's saving grace continues to be the wonders that the film's limitless budget can provide to an expressive animated universe. There's no real urgent ambition here, just an opportunity for viewers to reconnect with old \"friends.\""

To stop being so serious for a second, I would like to mention the fact that this movie is hilarious at times. Donkey is possibly funnier than ever and the new princess gang is brilliant to say the least. I loved the ending and loved Pinochio. Prince Charming is an annoying downside to the movie and Fiona is not really in the movie. Justin Timberlake takes a large portion of the movie and does a excellent job in his scenes with shrek.

The second one sucked and is the one that would deserve this kind of press. But the third Shrek was light and fun... the way it should be. Not with a overly long story and a boring d\u00e9ja vu of all that the 2 movies could offer. They couldn't have reinvented the series and people's expectations becomes too high. Some of those jokes are hilarious as hell (is anyone getting those jokes or is it just me?) The -1 of the rating would be for the kid's appeal was a little bit less than the other two."

I don't think I heard more than five laughs out of the whole audience that was in the cinema to see this. It just wasn't funny at all. Really really poor quality stuff. But hey, I'm sure the kids will like it."

My nephews (ages 6 and 11) liked it--strange that most of the humor is aimed at adults and falls totally flat, but the kids just like anything animated. Well, I guess the producers will make their money. Unbelievable waste of time--like paying 10 bucks to watch a bad tv sit com."
