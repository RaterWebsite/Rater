The big difference is that all of the main characters are Black and based on real people who roamed the Wild West. The plot follows a young outlaw (Jonathan Majors) who\u2019s out for revenge, which also leads to 2 gangs fighting it out. The cast is loaded with exceptional talent doing great work, including Idris Elba, Regina King, LaKeith Stanfield, Delroy Lindo and R.J. Cyler, who provides the film\u2019s few humorous moments. This is an impressive first-time feature for director Jeymes Samuel (also known as British singer/songwriter The Bullitts). His mastery of staging and his unique visual comments show a surefire flair for the job. His script succeeds in making almost every character sympathetic, even though they rob and kill with impunity.

That point seems lost on the movies\u2019 producers and cast."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Who doesn't love a bloody revenge tale? If it's set in the wild, wild west, then that's even better. Nothing can be more entertaining than shoot outs, saloons, and outlaws. The Harder They Fall, which opened in limited release last Friday and premieres on Netflix next week, has it all in spades. I took a trek to the theater to catch this stylish Western with a stacked cast; and here's how it went down.The plot of The Harder They Fall is relatively simple and like most Westerns it centers on one man's quest for revenge. Nat Love (Jonathan Majors) is on a quest to avenge the brutal murders of his mother and father. Love has to track down Rufus Buck (Idris Elba) and every member of his gang, which includes the brutal and devious, Trudy Smith (Regina King) and the quickdraw Cherokee Bill (LaKeith Stanfield). Love's crew of outlaws, which has otherwise been preoccupied with robbing bank robbers, sets out to find Buck after he has been busted out of prison. Bloody hijinks ensue. (Side Note: I kept thinking about bloody Tarantino movies - there may be some inspiration from those films)Jeymes Samuel directs this stylish and anachronistic Western filled with an all star cast. While this is Samuel's first major motion picture as a director, he has a background in music and it shows. On top of that, Jay-Z is involved as a producer. The bona fides of Samuel and Jay-Z are front and center with a top notch soundtrack that infuses each scene with cool energy. Although the plot is pretty basic, the dialogue has an amount of wit and swagger that bring such fun to this film. The director has been able to bring modern sensibility to the old West through the language, casting and production values. The technical achievements here in the costumes, production design and sound only make the film that much more enjoyable. There are a few lulls in the action here and there, but for the most part, it's a wild ride that doesn't let up.I'll note that this cast is a who's who of Black Hollywood. Let me run this down for you right quick. Jonathan Majors keeps getting great roles and knocking them out of the park. It is good to see him in the lead, and he does a good job centering this film. The specter of Idris Elba looms large throughout. He is perfectly cast as Rufus Buck and gets to be the menacing presence behind the curtain. Regina King kills it in this fun role. She gets to kick butt and take names. I would not want to meet her character in any dark alley. Then, LaKeith Stanfield brings his swagger and cool to Cherokee Bill. These four are highlights, but Delroy Lindo, Zazie Beetz, Deon Cole, RJ Cyler and Damon Wayans, Jr., each, get great moments too.Ultimately, The Harder They Fall is a great Western that has fun music cues, a cool cast, and epic fight scenes worth your time. This is an easy big box of popcorn, especially when it debuts on Netflix."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "A very stylized western with an all-black cast that is as entertaining as dull. 'The Harder They Fall' walks the thin line between being derivate and being authentic.I had a good time watching it, but there were very boring moments throughout it.

The music choice was great as it differentiated the film from the others in the genre. The cinematography was amazing and the set design was top notch.

That is something that I think they should've kept more consistent, some characters talked with a western drawl while some talked like someone would today.

It's a tale of revenge split between the outlaw group whose leader is hunting the people that did him wrong and the outlaw group whose leader did the wrongdoing. As a whole in terms of story, it's nothing new, but where this movie shines and gives you a fresh experience is in its execution. From the getgo, you can tell that this is a passion project for Jeymes Samuel, the director and co-writer, who wanted to give a unique or different feel to a well-known genre. The madlad also did the soundtrack and worked tightly with the cinematographer and editor so that his clean and polished vision of westerns can be properly brought on to the screen. The film is oozing with style and slickness as all the technical elements synergize together properly and seamlessly flow. It looks great and sounds great, and the odd mix of hip-hop and classic western music works surprisingly well. The main attraction of the film, though, is the amazing cast. Idris Elba, Jonathan Majors, Lakeith Stanfield, Regina King, Zazzie Beats and the rest of them were on top of their game and since they were inhabiting colourful/interesting characters, it was an absolute blast watching them go at it. Couple that with fun and often interesting dialogue and I could watch these characters interact with each other for a long time. While not a full-blown action film, whatever thrilling scenes it did have were entertaining and bloody. The pacing can be slow for long stretches, though, as you go through the 140 mins runtime while things are being set up but it's not boring. I was enjoying the characters a great deal regardless of whether they are shooting each other or are just conversing. In fact, the first 40-50 mins or so were amazing. I was hooked and was loving the larger-than-life feel of some of the characters as well as the visuals and sounds accompanying it. It's a pleasure in a Home Theater.  However, where the movie faltered for me was in the second half where it lost some of that steam and intrigue. The biggest issue for me was that the writing couldn't balance all the main characters well and some remained on the sidelines throughout as well as the expectations that get built up early on and not being delivered fully. There was also a lack of Idris Elba that kinda annoyed me and I was so wishing that the creators could somehow channel Tarantino to have long stretches of dialogue for key scenes. I kinda wish they focused a bit less on the romance and more on the smaller characters as well as the personal vendetta. Also, the final shootout, while thrilling and enjoyable, did ask for a lot of suspension of disbelief. The stormtrooper aim got ridiculous at points. And had the movie ended that way, I would have been disappointed but thankfully it had a trump card that was played wonderfully in the end and brought it home nicely even if I wish it was given a few mins more. All in all, this was a welcome surprise. I honestly wasn't expecting to get something fresh from a genre that has been done so many times but here we are. Sure the film has its faults that keep it from being a truly great experience for me but it is still damn good and I'd recommend it without a second thought. It's on Netflix, so you can easily access it. And if I were to rate it, I'd give it a 7.8/10."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "The irony of the film made it watchable.

That was a positive thing.The presentation is straightforward, although its narrative and structure are not always concise.There are points where the dialogue feels too elaborate, lacking in better fluidity, while the director also fails to create a really interesting tension until the very last act.

Idris is always great to see, but especially in the role of the antagonist. Jonathon majors work continues to impress. Regina King seems to bring her A game so effortlessly these days and is so on top of her craft at this stage of her career. Delroy has a great performance here; he always has a solid vocal and facial personality on the screen.
