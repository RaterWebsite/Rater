This isn't just a movie about toys, it's a movie about genuine human emotions. Its funny, clever, sad, and enlightening. For an animated movie to have all of these characteristics and to surpass most movies I've seen lately is incredible.

While I am not nearly as sentimental about my old toys as Andy is-to be honest I barely remember them- I relate to his childhood nostalgia. And to nostalgia for Toy Story, of course. Apparently, one of the major themes of the film is growing up and the impermanence of life; well, I've only really become aware of the passing of time recently, because I'm now at the age where enough time has passed for me to notice the changes since childhood. This movie speaks to my current zeitgeist, and that of quite a few other people I'm sure."

But Woody soon learns the truth about the place, but is whisked out of the centre and must return to help his friends escape the clutches of Lotso (Ned Beatty) and his henchmen.\rThe film invites us all back to enjoy our memories of these simple plastic dolls, and its hard to remember a film like this that makes us feel the way we do, because after fifteen years, its still got it. We have grown up with these toys, and we are reminded just how difficult growing up can be, especially after an imaginative childhood I'm sure most of us had. The cleverness and cunning nature of a child is all within Toy Story 3 and blends perfectly with the diverse set of characters to keep everyone entertained.\rIt is truly wonderful to see how far these visuals have come since the original, with so much more detail and colour that truly put Pixar at the top of the perch in animation and story.\rPerfect can indeed be thrown around, but for Toy Story 3 it rings true for so many reasons. It has the perfect blend of comedy, heart and even action, combined with the original voice cast including Tim Allen and Tom Hanks while also bringing in the likes of Michael Keaton and Timothy Dalton. Pixar really have created a masterful animated adventure that will continue to reach for our inner child.\rWith a perfect ending that will surely turn on the waterworks, its hard to say if there should be another film, simply because of the perfection of this and the first two that have created the perfect trilogy.\rMasterful, emotional, but a truly hilarious and brilliant effort that will continue to surprise and exceed, but a film that will also find a place deservedly among the best."

With Andy leaving for college, now in his late teens, his mother is urging him to get rid of his old toys before he leaves. When the gang of toys end up being mistakenly taken to a kindergarten play-centre instead of being left in the attic like they should have been they form a plan to get back home as quickly as possible. However they all realise that Andy will never play with them again, he is far to old to love them like he used to and they will just gather dust so staying in the play-centre is the better option. Its not until they are made unwelcome by the current residents of the kindergarten that they decide to put this plan into motion with less than successful results due to a grumpy old toy who was abandoned by their owner years ago.\rToy Story 3 is a great conclusion to the amazing coming of age saga that has been the Toy Story series. The sound and animation is just as great as usual, the old characters are still cool and the new characters are well introduced and likeable. Whether Toy Story still has a future is unknown but for the last 15 years toy story provided us with one of the best animated tales ever created and that by itself is a reason to celebrate."

      "text": "Summary Review\r+ Great Visual style\r+ Good story with some interesting parts to it\r+ Good voice acting\r+ Fantastic ending to a great movie franchise\r-Story is predictable and it fairly unoriginal\r-Way too much goes on in this movie\r As a result I would recommend this film because it\u2019s interesting. However I do feel it is a bit over-rated and will hopefully explain why I think this way.\r Full Review\rThe first thing I have to say about the movie, as is a trademark of the Toy Story franchise is that of how the animation within the film is fantastic. There really is a great balance between the creative nature of the design of the locations within the film which are creative enough to be interesting but not so out of this world they feel out of place. Such visuals I feel are enhanced by the lighting which really enhances the contrast between the dark and lighter areas. This is particularly the case with the day care centre that the toys end up in with a great sense of realism and creativity between the playground and the play area within the centre. Of course there are moments that do seem slightly out of place but that can be forgiven given that the overall look of the film is great.\r However for me a good looking film also needs to have and interesting story. I feel the angle that this film takes is quite an interesting one. Put simply Andy grows old and is heading for college, and the Toys end up in a day care centre (apart from Woody). This raises interesting issues about the Toys \u2018loyalty\u2019 to their owner. The story is made further when the Toys realise life at the day care centre is not all it is cracked up to be, epically when more is revealed about the \u2018ruler\u2019 (if you will) of the toys at day care (Lotso). I won\u2019t spoiler the plot, but overall it is quite interesting. Furthermore as with many Pixar films there are some elements of comedy mixed in with the \u2018sad\u2019 moments (in particularly Buzz\u2019s Spanish mode), that help keep the story fresh.\r However the main thing I found great about the film is that of the ending. This is not because I wanted the film to end, but because of how satisfying the movie ended. For sure it is not that original and not very surprising, but the fact that it seems to put the franchise to rest and reunite the toys helps to make the ending of the film really satisfying.\r With all this said, I really do feel this movie is over-rated seeing as how nearly all reviews I have read rate it the film either a 9 or a 10 out of 10, ratings that I really don\u2019t feel the film deserves.  The first major complaint I have with the film is that of the story while it is good, there are some key problems I feel need to be outlined. The first is that of how there is very little character development of the main character as you learn nothing new about them, meaning characters like Woody, Buzz etc. (despite the excellent voice acting) feel the same from the last two movies of the franchise. For sure the film does introduce new characters like Barbie and Ken that arguably help undermine this problem, but they feel under-developed and for the most part pointless. The second issue I have with the story is that of the lack of originality. This can be seen by how for a big section of the film, the story of Toy Story 2 is reused only this time it is Woody trying to find his friends  rather than the other way round. Likewise the whole notion of the toy getting separated from their owner seems a bit too familiar. Such lack of originality I find affects the sub-plots, such as the obvious love story between Barbie and Ken, and the development of Buzz and Jess\u2019 friendship. This lack of originality meant that I found the film to be predictable and not as gripping as it should be. As a result while the story I good, I did not find it as original/interesting as say Monster Inc. University.\r The second major complaint I have with the film is that of how, like Monster Inc. University, I found Pixar tried to cram too much into this film without expanding on the story too much.  This can be seen with how elements like the Toys ending up in the scrap yard, feels more like padding than anything else. Likewise the whole backstory of Lotso, I found was breezed over and did not fully answer all questions. As a result I felt that the writers of the film should have focused more developing the characters and the story on the whole.\r However, although I have criticised the film, don\u2019t get me wrong it is still a great movie, just a movie I do not feel is as good as everyone claims. Hopefully I have explained myself."

Audiences were amazed, not only by the introduction of CGI animation, but also by Toy Story's heartwarming characters and innovative storytelling. CGI is ubiquitous nowadays, largely due to Toy Story's success.\r After nearly 15 years since the last installment, Pixar resurrects Woody and Buzz to create a masterful, heartwarming conclusion that is bound to resonate amongst audiences of all ages. Over the past 20 years, Andy has aged with us, and he is now preparing to leave for college. The toys encounter misfortune and are separated from Andy yet again.\r The film successfully maintains the franchise's outstanding humor and voice acting. Toy Story 3's visual exhibit the best artistic design and technical excellence in the business. Randy Newman provides a memorable score along with a special Gipsy Kings song. Toy Story 3 investigates our attachment to toys, the challenge of becoming an adult, and our relationship with future generations.\r Toy Story 3 is the perfect farewell to Woody, Buzz, and the rest of the gang.

But after they\u2019re welcomed to Sunnyside Daycare Centre by the kindly Lots-O\u2019-Huggin\u2019 Bear (Beatty) they realise this seeming toy\u2019s paradise is actually something closer to hell...\r Pixar has done it again, extending an amazing streak of successes that stretches all the way back to the original Toy Story, which changed the face of feature length animation when it reached theaters in 1995. Now, 15 years after their original debut and 11 years after the first sequel, Toy Story 2, Woody (voice of Tom Hanks), Buzz (Tim Allen), and their fellow toys have returned to the screen for another adventure. Although aspects of Toy Story 3 echo similar elements from the previous films, making this the least original entry in the trilogy, the movie's final act will resonate deeply with many viewers, making this chapter in many ways the most heartfelt.\r he story, which is simple enough in its essence, affords opportunities for action (the Great Escape), comedy (Ken & Barbie, Buzz's Spanish personality), and pathos. The ending, which is surprisingly affecting, will speak more deeply to adults than children. Those in the latter group will understand the importance of friendship, but older viewers will perceive other, bittersweet things: the fleeting nature of childhood and how all things pass, seemingly in the blink of an eye. Children are only peripherally aware of the passage of time, but adults sometimes recognize little else. There's a moment in Toy Story 3, when Andy experiences an epiphany, that brings this all home. The scene, which may go unnoticed by the core demographic, will bring lumps to the throats and tears to the eyes of some parents. This is the kind of thing Pixar does so effectively, and the reason why their films achieve greater respect than those of their less ambitious competitors.\r From a purely artistic standpoint, Toy Story 3 is superior, although not vastly so, than its predecessors. At the time of their releases, Toy Story and Toy Story 2 were cutting edge, but the bar hasn't moved much in 11 years. The problem with this movie is the 3-D, which is the \"preferred\" format for its screening. The bright rainbow of colors becomes murky and washed out, with grays withering the kaleidoscope of hues. In addition, the 3-D appears to have been employed as an afterthought - there are lengthy sequences in which it either isn't used or is used minimally. I was surprised to find I could take off the 3-D glasses and, for stretches, not be confounded by blurred or double images. In the case of Toy Story 3, 3-D adds nothing except a box office surcharge.\r With most franchises, animated or otherwise, the well has run dry by the time the third episode is under consideration, which explains why so many second sequels fail to meet expectations. In a way, the same may be true of Toy Story 3, but it doesn't strain to be different to the point where it loses sight of its strengths. Instead, it focuses on the reasons for its popularity and amplifies those. Our familiarity with the characters and their interaction becomes an asset, making the action scenes more than displays of pixels zipping across the screen. The writing shows a deftness of touch that provides Toy Story 3 with emotional depth. And director Lee Unkrich, a Pixar fixture who co-directed Toy Story 2 (among other films), shows the same mastery of elements evident in the other Toy Story films, allowing for a seamless continuity. Toy Story 3 enhances the legacy of its brand while providing exceptional entertainment value for viewers of all ages, especially for those who favor the brighter, livelier 2-D iteration over the 3-D gimmick."

Filled to the brim with nostalgia and references from the previous movies in the franchise, it probably couldn't have been any better than it was. We start out knowing the toys haven't been played with in a while and they miss it. They even go to the trouble of creating an elaborate plan just to get Andy to notice them for one minute. Their plan hardly works, but then Andy needs to pack for college. Has to decide who stays and who goes. Woody is to go to college with him and the rest are to live in the attic, but instead they accidentally go on an adventure none of them will soon forget.\r Andy is leaving for college, so naturally there will be emotion surrounding his family and leaving, but with everything he's leaving behind as well. We can even feel the emotion in the toys. Their owner is leaving them because he's all grown up now and doesn't need them anymore, much like his own family. Throughout the toys' journey, they end up at Sunnyside daycare. It seems a friendly and inviting place at first, but inside it's like a dystopia. I can't help but think this is modeled off of some human society, but portrayed with a social hierarchy in toys instead. This movie doesn't lack on the comedy either. Ken and Barbie feel like they were \"made for each other.\" Guess they never would have guessed that they actually were.\r One of the most significant parts of the movie to me was the soundtrack. It varied immensely for each scene and really did add so much. It evoked the feeling of horror in the times spent in the caterpillar room, and happiness when in the butterfly room. Very skillfully put together and every artistic aspect was nearly perfect. Lotso is also truly an amazing villain. He has a haunting backstory that is eventually revealed, has to personas that he shows off to people depending on the time of day, and he ends the story as still a villain by betraying his friends but really gets what was coming to him by getting attached to that truck.\rOf course all the toys get back safe. This is what everyone wants and is rooting for. But the hard part of the movie is far from over. We see Andy leaving his mother \"I wish I could always be with you.\" \"You will be, mom.\" and his family, as well as his toys. He has to make the difficult decision to let them go because he's moving on as well. When Andy gives his toys away to Bonnie, it's like he's giving us away as well. I grew up with Toy story on VHS at my grandma's house. I grew up with these toys. Like they were my own toys. I'm the same age as Andy is right now, the same time in my life. Although this is probably my 3rd time watching it, I still feel the same way about this bittersweet ending. It's truly beautiful and leaves the toys and Andy both in a great place in their relationship and story that no continuation could ever make it better. An ending that lets us leave the characters on the screen as Andy leaves his toys. Probably the best sequel I have ever seen. Also still love the Totoro cameo by John Lassetter for his boy Hayao Miyazaki."

But this movie does!\r This movie makes you laugh and cry at the same time, and, when the toys are in danger, you're actually on the edge of your seat waiting for the outcome of the situation, even though you know they won't die (after all, it's Pixar!).\r This definitely deserved best animated picture, and it is a must see not just for Toy Story fans, not just for Pixar fans, but for regular cinema-goers also!"

      "text": "The first two films in Pixar's animated Toy Story franchise are brilliant bookends, models of technique warmed by humor and imagination. Toy Story 3, coming 11 years after the last one, should have been a letdown. I mean, how hard can you squeeze a golden goose before the bird calls a work stoppage?\r No worries. Toy Story 3, decked out in nifty, non-showy 3-D, is a joy to behold. It hits every button from laughter to tears and lifts you up on waves of visual dazzlement. And you don't need to take a kid along to appreciate it. Jeez, people, we were all kids once. And the way the Pixar wizards re-create a sense of childhood wonder is damn near genius.\r Cowboy Woody (again voiced by Tom Hanks with just the right blend of wit and hardwon wisdom) and astronaut Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen in playfully scrappy vocal form) are toys in crisis. Andy, the boy who gave these toys a home, is off to college. He's outgrown his playthings, including cowgirl Jessie (Joan Cusack), Hamm (John Ratzenberger), Rex (Wallace Shawn), Barbie (Jodi Benson) and the Potatoheads (Don Rickles and Estelle Harris). Andy plans to put his toys in the attic. Instead, they end up in trash bags and mistakenly kicked to the curb to await the garbage truck. Yikes! Kids and adults with abandonment issues (you know who you are) might want to give this chapter a pass.\r OK, take a breath. The toys make it to the Sunnyside Day Care Center, where they meet new toys, such as bizarro Big Baby, ditzy triceratops Trixie (Kristen Schaal) and Shakespeare-spouting hedgehog Mr. Pricklepants (a plummy Timothy Dalton). And Barbie finally hooks up with Ken, hilariously voiced by Michael Keaton as a closet case who's watched too much Project Runway. I'm kidding, but just barely.\r The prospect of being played with by new kids delights Andy's toys. That is, until Lotso (Ned Beatty), a plush bear with ulterior motives, puts them in a roomful of hyperactive, toybashing tots. That scene is scary-funny. A later scene, in which the toys narrowly escape incineration, is just scary.\r The fun returns in the nick of time. It's impossible not to giggle when Buzz gets his language button switched to Spanish. Still, there's no denying that Toy Story 3, vividly directed by Lee Unkrich from a richly detailed script by Michael Arndt (Little Miss Sunshine), goes darker and emotionally deeper than its predecessors. The sequence in which Andy introduces his  toys to a shy little girl named Bonnie (Emily Hahn) is a heartbreaker. So is the movie. Tag it as one of the year's best."
