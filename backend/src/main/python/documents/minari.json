Director Lee Isaac Chung's heartfelt domestic drama about a South Korean immigrant family seeking a fresh start and a better tomorrow in 1980s rural Arkansas is just the kind of movie that we need right now, much as \"Moonlight\" was the film we needed in 2016. The picture's exquisite cinematography, nuanced script and narrative, and superb ensemble cast make for a moving cinematic experience that leaves viewers with a warm glow that lasts long after the movie's final frame. Richly deserving of the many accolades and award nominations it has received thus far, \"Minari\" truly stands out among this year's field of contenders, masterfully and lovingly handled in virtually every respect.

This is the type of movie that even though the story is about a Korean immigrant family, you can still draw a deep emotional connection to it.While the subject matter can have its dramatic elements, but it\u2019s not to say the movie doesn\u2019t have a sense of humor. It\u2019s funny and incredibly endearing to watch. The movie does a great job of making you care about this family and you wish everything would work out for them. All thanks to the amazing script that helps flesh out the characters and made them all complex.The performances from Steven Yeun, Han Ye-ri, and Youn Yuh-jung were all fantastic. Even from the child actors, Alan S. Kim and Noel Cho, gave great performances, especially during the more dramatic parts of the movie. Just goes to show there are great child actors out there.The score, composed by Emile Mosseri, was superb and mixed Western and eastern styles to create a uniquely rich score. The movie itself looks so warm and sunny. The bright sun made all the mixture of different colors like green and blue look so luminous, it felt peaceful.I can tell a story like this came from a personal place from director Lee Isaac Chung. You see, he came from a Korean family and he spend his childhood in Arkansas. The story was told from the heart and it was beautiful to watch.Overall rating: A touching and heartfelt movie that deserves all the praise it\u2019s getting. If you get the chance, check this one out."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Beautiful Film. So glad I was able to see it at Sundance in 2020.

I had just learned this film existed a few weeks ago but since this film was getting such high praise I went into this with pretty high expectations. This is such a gentle yet emotionally straining film, it\u2019s truly a special experience to watch. The plot is great it\u2019s an entertaining and deeply engaging story. It starts off as a story that has been told before but becomes much much more. The pacing is great from the first scene until the credits role it\u2019s well paced. The acting is great Steven Yeun and Yeri Han give great performances. Yuh-Jung Youn gives a fantastic supporting performance, she is easily one of the best parts of this film. Alan S. Kim and Noel Cho give great child performances as well.The direction is fantastic from Lee Isaac Chung, his direction is incredibly impressive and you can tell he was very passionate about making this. The script is great it\u2019s a memorable and very well written script. The cinematography is fantastic, this film is full of shots that are so beautiful it\u2019ll make your jaw drop. There is a certain shot where Jacob and Monica are watching the kids playing in the hospital waiting room and the camera focuses back and forth on the two faces. That one shot perfectly captures the story of the characters in less than a minute. The editing is great and the score is great as well.The comedy is very subtle but when there is comedy it\u2019s wholesomely funny. In terms of the Oscars there\u2019s a strong possibility that this will sadly be overlooked/snubbed. If this did get it\u2019s deserved attention from the academy I feel this would probably get nominated for Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, Best Cinematography, and Best Supporting Actress: Yuh-Jung Youn. The ending scenes of the film are very emotional and the last shot is just brilliant.

While the film does feel rather pedestrian in its execution for the most part, the performances, camera-work, and message of hope are what help to maintain the film's charm and tenderness. Overall, it's a family drama that is likely to touch your soul, but admittedly is heavy with emotion too, which may make it feel a little rough at times. Still though, it's undoubtedly a great depiction of family and human spirit and resilience."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Minari won both of the drama awards (The grand jury and the audience agreed.) at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival and rightfully so!"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Minari is one of the most inspirational family films I have watched in years. This exceptional cast pushes the limits of their family dynamic, as well as our hearts, as we see them struggle with everyday life problems. Jacob, played by Steven Yeun, moves from California to a Farmland in Arkansas with his family. The goal is to build a sustainable farm and live the American dream while dealing with many real-life issues that test the resilience of the household. He and his wife, Monica, played by Han Ye-ri, are recent immigrants from Korea in search of a better life for their kids. Jacob's dream of owning a farm brings the family to Arkansas with the purchase of a large farm and a house made out of an eighteen-wheeler. Monica is not fully happy with this plan for many reasons but goes along with the move to keep the family together. Director Lee Isaac Chung wrote and directed this semi-autobiographical film in 2018, ironically around a time he was considering retiring from directing. Though not a factual documentary, Chung included many memories into the film based on his childhood home in Arkansas. The fact that the film is based on many important moments in Chung's life is the driving force of the film. Early memories help to define who we are and Chung uses Jacob's son, David, as our guide through the film, allowing the audience to witness all these beautiful moments in his life unfold before their eyes. Moments of discovery, moments of understanding, and moments that teach him life lessons. Every member of David's family teaches him something important about life at some point in the film and these moments will define him for the rest of his life. Many of these important life lessons come from his relationship with his grandmother Soonja, who he spends all day with while his parents are at work. The two often travel down to the creek where they have started a small garden of their own with a plant from Korea called Minari, echoing the much larger garden of American vegetables that Jacob has grown.Their kids Anne (Noel Cho) and David (Alan Kim) are at a very delicate age in their lives and Monica knows that their new environment will be a major change for them. One of her fears is the loss of their Korean culture because there are only a few Koreans in the new town they live in. Monica's mother moving in to help out with the kids is one of the ways they try and keep the Korean traditions thriving in the house. David also has some unexplained medical issues early on and living in the middle of nowhere poses an issue in the case that a hospital is needed for him. All of these issues are just some of the things that the family deals with which are easy to sympathize with.  The family is also struggling with their faith in the film. Having moved to a new town, working new jobs, and balancing new priorities, Monica worries that the kids are not going to practice their faith as often due to the town not having a Korean Church, but they choose to attend the towns Sunday mass in order to provide their children with an outlet to continue practicing their faith as well as interact with other local kids. Ironically, as everyone struggles with their issues, the one character that seems to be the happiest is also the most faithful in the film; Jacob's farm helper, Paul, is an extremely dedicated Christian who carries a cross around town each Sunday. To the Yi family, he comes off as a nut but he is often the voice of reason and offers his opinion in many situations, even though he is often discredited. As the head of the household, Jacob often has to deal with very difficult decisions that sometimes put the family at risk, and he often makes these decisions without even discussing them with Monica. Jacob's desire to succeed sometimes clouds his judgment and puts his family in harm's way but that he lives with his choices and continues to fight tomorrow. Regardless of how big or small; any choice you make in life has a repercussion and many of the choices made by the characters, seem to come full circle in the film. They often present themselves as new problems or make situations worse, however, it is the family's determination to learn and grow through these decisions that is most important. I really connected with this film and the Yi family, so much so that each member taught me something about myself in one way or another.

It is certainly a special movie which I very much recommend. It has earned 6 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and I think it is deserving of the recognition and praise it has so far received. Writer-director Lee Isaac Chung based this story of a Korean family settling in rural Arkansas in the 1980\u2019s to start a farm on his own similar childhood experiences. In dramatizing his own story, Chung has made a film that is personal and relatable even if you are not Korean, or a farmer, or an immigrant. If you\u2019ve tried chasing any part of the American dream, you\u2019ll recognize something in Minari.Stephen Yuen and Yeri Han play Jacob and Monica, a Korean couple who have just moved from California to Arkansas with their two young children, Anne and David, to pursue Jacob\u2019s dream of having a big farm\u2014like the Garden of Eden\u2014that will thrive and allow the family to do the same. Monica is skeptical to say the least, especially when she sees the trailer on the plain plot of land that is to be their new home. Adding to her anxiety is David\u2019s heart murmur and how far away they are from a city and a hospital. The arrival of Monica\u2019s mother, Soonja, complicates some things (like the sleeping arrangement in the small trailer) and livens up others.Minari\u2019s focus is on the relationship that shy 6-year-old David has with his outspoken grandmother, Soonja. This isn\u2019t a cutesy movie about a little boy and his sassy grandma, though they certainly have that dynamic. David doesn\u2019t like that she doesn\u2019t act like a \u201creal\u201d grandma: she doesn\u2019t bake cookies, she swears, watches wrestling, and drinks Mountain Dew. Yuh-jung Youn as Soonja steals every scene and is far and away the standout performer of the film. She has earned a well-deserved Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination and would be my choice to win if I were allowed to pick the winners. She isn\u2019t just funny\u2014which she is\u2014or the character most out of place in this new home\u2014which she is\u2014but the emotions she stirs and her relationship with David are the heart of the movie. Alan Kim as David is just what you hope for in a child actor. He does not draw attention to himself and his behavior always comes across as natural, not contrived, even when he is playing a gross prank of his grandma. They share a wonderful, quiet scene together at a creek near the farm where she plants minari, a leafy vegetable; it is my favorite scene in the movie.Steven Yeun, nominated for the Best Actor Oscar, and Yeri Han work very well together as a believable married couple. He is determined but not bullheaded and she is not unsupportive or a nag but is justifiably feeling isolated and concerned. It is clear that they care for each other and even though they are at a place where their future together is uncertain, we do not feel that they have a bad marriage. Will Patton, a familiar face even if you don\u2019t recognize his name, has a small role with a notable performance as the kindhearted but very eccentric local who gladly helps Jacob on the farm. He speaks in tongues randomly and, in a scene late in the movie, performs an exorcism that is simultaneously comical and emotional.The beautiful Oscar nominated score by Emile Mosseri would be my pick to win that category, again, if I were allowed to pick the winners. It is ethereal and enchanting and brimming with pathos. Chung has a tenderness in his direction and his screenplay\u2014both are Oscar nominated\u2014towards each of the characters and their points of view. My only real complaint is the plot contrivance that leads to the climax, but it is not a major strike against the movie because it drives the drama of the story forward and the final moments won me back easily. From start to finish Minari is filled with the kind of small, intimate and affecting moments that are so rarely done well on screen. Wonderful, wonderful Minari indeed."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "(Mauro Lanari)\"Minari is not... a great or memorable movie... In the long run... it pays for its calm pace ...., perhaps failing to fully entrench in the viewer the emotions that he would like to cultivate\" (Marco Catenacci).

By dint of subdued, minimalist and asphyxiated intimism, discreet, delicate and modest poetics of everyday life, spasmodic, extremistic, paroxysmal hunt for symbols and a sermon more pedantic of the various preachers on stage (\"All you need is love\"), there is no room for the real dimension of the protagonists of the biopic. And the Academy could have directly rewarded the Beatles of '67."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "This film has quite a charming feel to it. It clearly shows a family who are trying to do well for themselves and find their own Korean community/identity in America, although not everything goes well and perhaps the love isn't as strong between some members. Its very much a film about 'the American dream' - making your own success and getting on as best you can. Its got funny moments and some more serious moments. I liked the scenes with the young boy and the grandmother (who he resents), them trying to get on and she trying to pass some knowledge down to him. There is definitely a sense of childhood innocence, with the film/camera showing things from the young son's perspective, primarily. it's a subtle film but by no means a bad one.Something ironic I noticed was one of the weirder characters seemed to be the local American guy who behaved erratically around the family when featured from time to time.Not a bad watch, this film is worth seeing, yes."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Minari was nominated for 6 Academy Awards this week, including Best Picture; so, I had to see what all the hype was about. Minari has been in select theaters for about a month and is available for rent on demand, but I can't say that I had heard much about the film until recently. Written and directed by Lee Isaac Chung, who received nominations for both, Minari tells the story of a Korean-American family that relocates from California to a farm in Arkansas in the 1980s. The father, Jacob Yi (Steven Yeun), has a plan to grow Korean vegetables in order to set his family on a path to the American Dream; and the mother, Monica (Yeri Han), strives to improve her skills as a chicken sexer to support the family as she continues to be skeptical of Jacob's ambitions. The promotion for this film says that this is the movie we need right now. We shall see.It is obvious that this is a personal story for Lee Isaac Chung. The family dynamics are depicted very tenderly, and although there are differences and arguments between the parents, neither is painted as a villain. Both Jacob and Monica want what's best for their family. We see much of the film through the eyes of the youngest Yi family member, David, who is played by Alan Kim in a remarkable performance for such a young child. There is a newness of the Arkansas landscape and the distant surrounding community that they all have to get acclimated to. While the plot of Minari is pretty basic just following whether Jacob will be successful in establishing his farm, once Monica's mother (Youn Yuh-jung) shows up a new energy and conflict is brought to the film.All the parts of Minari come together to create a satisfying whole. Chung focuses of the members of the family such that each one has a personality and a stake in what's happening. The cast that was brought together do great work. I certainly understand why Yeun and Yuh-jung were nominated for their acting and why Alan Kim will be a kid popping up in order movies in the future. Moreover, the lush landscapes of rural Arkansas look very inviting and the score heighten the emotional heft of the movie. For me, Minari was surprisingly enjoyable for an otherwise straightforward family drama.In conclusion, Minari is tender and emotional. More than ever, it does seem like it could be the movie we need right now. It reminds all of us about the typical American family that just wants its piece of the American Dream. Chung's personal touches makes Minari enjoyable and impactful. If you get a chance, get a big box of popcorn and watch this film."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This American-South Korean indie film reflects memories from director Lee Isaac Chung's childhood. After manageable living conditions in California, the South Korean family of four Yi moves to rural Arkansas, where the father wants to start a farm. This decision causes tension with his wife. The two children try to distract themselves from the arguments between their parents. However, they are bored most of the time until their hitherto unknown grandmother strides into their lives.The great strength of Minari lies in its outstanding cast and their chemistry with each other. There is no clear protagonist, they all get their own storylines and experiences. Alan Kim, as the youngest son David, is already confronted with fundamental situations. He and his big sister Anne (Noel Kate Cho) have several moments where unconditional sibling love is communicated in a very simple way. This makes their bond enormously natural and real. The most profound relationship, however, is shared by David and his grandmother Soon-ja, played by the fantastic Yoon Yeo-jeong. Although they don't get up to operating temperature at first because David refuses to acknowledge Soon-ja's anti-granny ways (she doesn't cook or bake and uses swear words), the two grow closer as the film progresses. Every time they share the screen, hilarious and emotional dialogue is guaranteed. Exclusively the latter applies to Steven Yeun and Han Ye-ri, who play the two parents Jacob and Monica. Although their mutual love is always palpable, they are in a continuous conflict that reaches its climax at the end. Jacob wants to leave sorting chicks behind and prove himself to his family with his own farm. Monica, on the other hand, is tired of living in a trailer and doing Jacob's bidding and is eager to give her children an adequate home. Both embody a couple that seems stable on the surface but is crumbling badly underneath.In addition to the fantastic actors, Chung Minari's direction adds the finishing touches. The script is funny, gets under the skin and gives someone the realistic picture of a family that wants to start a new and better life in the land of many opportunities. But the American dream is really only a secondary matter in Minari. Rather, Chung captures a natural and down-to-earth mood with stunning camerawork, a beautiful score and a lot of focus on the atmospheric mood. This makes the film a technical masterpiece that takes a lot of time in some scenes and therefore often seems almost still. This can sometimes seem tedious, but is completely in keeping with the overall feel of the film. While the first two acts of Minari focus on a lot of build-up and interpersonal interactions, things come to a head enormously in the last third. The film is told in a matter-of-fact way. Its inner and outer beauty makes Minari the feel-good experience of 2020!"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Loved it. Laughed, teared up, more than I expected.

The film has connected well with the viewer. I have not gone into the details of all the work required to make such a masterpiece. But I can acknowledge certain factors that really stood out to me. The acting to start with was on point. Struggling family.quarrels and argument between the parents while theit innocent children sit witnessing the horror trying to prevent the only adults whom they trust from fighting. The movie starts wholesome and slightly whacky with its own humour which any viewer would love. The narration the flow and everything to do with the story has been done well. I cannot emphasize how well the story has been written to make  this whole experience seem life-like, real true. The grandma I feel has potrayed her role beyond well. I think no other grandma could've outshone her except the viewers own. This is because the grandma has so successfully captured the essence of a slightly offset,cracked, flawed grandma that actually is real. the story so beutifully jumps between the stage two characters if the child and the grandma. The viewer does not really know whom to feel empathic for. The acting really allows the transition of the sadness for characters by the viewers, smooth. The last climactic chaos was so well placed  it just cannot be complemented enough. The best scene out of the whole movie has to be the walk which the grandma takes post causing her clumsy mistake. The walk was of shame, guilt, escape. We could see in her eyes the pain the sorrow. Even though she wanted to apologize she couldn't cause it would not save the goods from being destroyed. Nearly all viewers at a certain age in their lives feel like giving up or running away so that they don't act as an obstacle for the ones around them. That Same emotion was extremely well potrayed by her in that  scene . Following the same masterpiece level scen was another beautiful moment. Where the whole family was sleeping on the floor together showing unity and the grandma sitting, Staring at them. She was thinking about the loss , or that's what the viewers understands from her devasted emotions and still eyes. Over all I think the film has touched my heart. I am not someone who would cry to moving frames but this one for sure did crack me open vulnerable. It was too real. A real masterpiece."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "As part of an asian family growing up and assimilating in a western country, I really related to this film. I love the little asian culture nuanced jokes, especially involving the grandma. It's a real down-to-earth and wholesome film. The acting especially from the two leads is outstanding. Steven Yuen thoroughly deserved his Oscar nomination for this."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Academy Awards don't lie. Best Picture, Director, and Screenplay are all appropriate. I especially liked the fox supporting actor award. But the Golden Glove was silly. Foreign language movie award... What do you mean, \"Go back to your country!\" to Americans?As a Korean, there were many American elements that were difficult to understand. But it was the best drama movie of 2020, and it must be a great movie.I believe there will be a day when the world will be excited in the language of movies beyond the barrier of subtitles, which is about an inch long."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "It's that kind of movie who made you feel happier at the end and after of that, and the score was perfect, sometimes I felt high."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "One of the best movies of the new decade.
