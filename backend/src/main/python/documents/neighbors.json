Witch isn't that bad, The acting is what you expect from a late night comedy that's geared towards people who probably are not sober well watching the film. But the part that you care about in a comedy movie the most is great. The jokes, Offensive, Original and very adult.\rDefinitely get some friends together and watch this as a late night movie."

      "text": "In a summer that is filled to the bone with high levels of explosions, slinging webs, and carnivorous apes. But, on the other hand, if you look closely that lightly seeded throughout the busiest movie going season, we do get a splash of genuine heartfelt comedies. We saw this last year with \u201cWe\u2019re The Millers\u201d and the beloved \u201cThis Is The End\u201d and previous years with the likes of \u201cHorrible Bosses\u201d. While it comes sooner than expected, with summer 2014 already stacked high with tons of R-rated comedies. The new film \u201cNeighbors\u201d gets to draw first blood.\rFrom the creative team of Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, and director Nicholas Stoller. While the film\u2019s premise is intriguing enough, and believe me there are plenty of laughs to go around. However, in terms of the teams best, \u201cNeighbors\u201d is nowhere near the levels as last summer\u2019s \u201cThis Is The End\u201d, a film this team also had a huge stake in. However, thanks to the quick witted comedic timing of co-star Zac Efron, and the high velocity and energy levels of on-screen couple, Seth Rogen, and the always funny Rose Byrne \u201cNeighbors\u201d is hilarious. Although the film falls into a slew of typical plot patterns. Though towards the end of the film\u2019s duration, the humor, the jokes, and the message (if you can find it) are more than enough to equip \u201cNeighbors\u201d under another successful entry into the other Seth Rogen films that have preceded it.\r The film follows \u201cBig\u201d Mac Radner (Rogen) and his wife Kelly (Byrne) a young couple with a newborn baby, Stella. Which prohibits them from living a fun, and engaging life. Including their long time friends. This eventually leads to several failed attempts to maintain their old lifestyle (including a decision to take their baby to a rave). These thoughts are immediately thwarted when a fraternity Delta Psi, known for their outrageous parties, move in next door. Lead by president Teddy Sanders (Efron) and VP Pete Ragzolli (Dave Franco). The Couple eventually breaks a secluded promise they endeared to Teddy. Stating that if they had any issues, they won\u2019t call the police and instead talk to them personally. Thus causing a righteous uproar and bidding the war, as the tagline suggests, \u201cFamily vs Frat\u201d.\r If we look at the other films Nicholas Stoller has helmed including; \u201cPineapple Express\u201d, \u201cThe Sitter\u201d and...yeah .. \u201cYour Highness\u201d. Speaking literally, \u201cNeighbors\u201d is almost as good, if not better than all of those films. Partially because the film has such a strong story premise that mostly anyone can relate to. While the film\u2019s box office success will be propelled by women fleeing to see Zac Efron with his shirt off 85% of the film. I commend the actor, and truly felt him as a comedian. (This being Efron\u2019s first \u201creal\u201d comedic role, well.. if you count \u2018That Awkward Moment\u201d). As with most Rogen-esq films, the writing is top notch. Never does it cease to amaze me, that since \u201cThe 40 Year Old Virgin\u201d these descendants of the great Judd Apatow are eerily consistent with every film they put out.\r The film, however, is nothing without this impeccable cast. Lead by Seth Rogen, but the real show stealer must belong to, Rose Byrne as the loveable, yet manipulative wife. While her character is not stereotypical in any way, I felt the role was tailor made just for her. There is also some good supporting work as well from MADTV alum, Ike Barinholtz. And fan favorites Christopher-Mintz Plasse and Dave Franco. The film comes on strong a few times, but the story progress nicely. \u201cNeighbors\u201d also transitions well between some hefty raunchy and lude R-rated behavior, to a more sentimental approach about friendship.\r \u201cNeighbors\u201d on a grander scale as a whole works diligently in the path it\u2019s headed. It caters to it\u2019s young crowd of college students, but also makes it worthwhile for older adults as well. There were moments in this film when I could not see the screen, because, I was laughing too hard. The film easily balances it\u2019s themes, inappropriate humor and value perfectly. Never settling for second hand jokes, the film that has enough quotes to last the summer. Sure there are escalated times of when you may not be laughing enough. However, all the stars are evenly matched and the film no question earns my good graces, as well as, the hefty R-rating bestowed upon it.\r B+\r By: Nate Adams\r Directed By: Nicholas Stoller\rRated: R\rRun-Time: 93 mins\rStudio: Universal Pictures\rRelease Date: May 9th 2014\r Thanks For Stopping By."

I'm too busy questioning the actions of these characters to care about what's going on in the story. Why do these parents even care about their noisy neighbors? They love partying, doing drugs, and leaving their infant child home alone. Why would these parents care if their baby can't sleep? They are already having intercourse in front of the child... Also, why would a police officer rat out a neighbor that filed a noise complaint? Why would someone dry hump a bush sculptor of a person bent over to get rid of it? Just cut it down! It's like an 8 year old wrote this script. I found myself asking constantly, \"Why is this happening?\" I must have missed the part where I was suppose to laugh. I was expecting to find a funny clever film like This is the End... Oh, how wrong I was. Good job everyone. You fooled me into paying a lot of money to see this garbage. The joke's on me."

If you did not watch the trailers and you are going in blind that is great for you, because every minute in this movie either has a joke or is sweet. Everyone in this movie did a great job, Seth Rogen plays like every Seth Rogen in a movie which is really fun to watch, Rose Byrne is actually very funny in this movie and HOT. Zac Efron is the one Disney lead that did not ruin his life and apparently his movie career is going up and I am happy for him he was so funny in this movie, he can be goofy and douche perfectly well! Apparently this movie is a step forward in its genre, it is unforgettable, hilarious and just so well made I highly recommend it to everyone! Just go see it and you'll know why!"

It\u2019s about old vs. new generations going at it, but at its core, it\u2019s a film that\u2019s about learning when to grow up and take responsibility. The script is infused with hilarious jokes, ridiculous pranks and situations, and intelligent pop-culture references that bridge generations. The story itself is quite enjoyable, even though at times the movie can feel a bit unfocused.\r The characters are colorful and likeable and the actors give some great comedic performances. Seth Rogan is hilarious and provides most of the laughs. His shameless attitude really allows for some awesome and gut wrenchingly funny moments. Zac Effron proves yet again that he is a born star, who will be one of the biggest stars in the near future. His comedic timing is impeccable and he is just so great to watch. Dave Franco is also no short of awesome as well as the rest of the cast.\r Overall, \u201cNeighbors\u201d is a really hilarious film that is not short on laughs and also some valuable life lessons. It has a fun soundtrack and the direction, especially for the party scene are well done. Probably the best comedy of the year and really worth checking out. I give it 4/5"

I remember one drunken fraternity brother riding his motorcycle around our dining room to the great amusement of our drunken brothers and the enormous mess that this party created - spraying beer at each other etc., etc. But there was also deep bonding which endured as we shared our lives and growing older and becoming adults seemed so, so far away - just like this fraternity portrayed here. The contrast with the couple next store (really struggling with their transition to adult responsibilities)  provided the depth that was below the surface of all the comedy and tensions.

Nicholas Stoller- director of Get Him to The Greek directs. It's a raunchy, over the top comedy film- and at that- its funny. Seth and Rose give good performances but Zac Efron is the best of the bunch, not every Disney star gets pinned. But there are flaws, the frat vs family prank war gets tiring quickly, with mind numbing party scenes which just suck.

      "text": "Neighbors touches on some interesting ideas for a comedy but doesn\u2019t do much of interest with them. The couple vs. the frat house can be amusing at times but in the end it comes across more mean-spirited than funny. The film could\u2019ve salvaged this through some message about recapturing one\u2019s youth and this idea is kind of there but never fully explored. The strongest moments in the film come from the Frat House. The actors playing these characters work well with Zac Efron finding a nice role for himself while watching the schenanigans of the frat house, I found myself wishing this was about a bunch of teenagers doing dumb stuff and while we do get that it comes more from the attacks of the neighbors and their cruel intentions. It would\u2019ve been a lesser version of Animal House but I could\u2019ve settled for that. Or even if they wanted the neighbors to join in the house. Instead, the film ends with the frat house being shut down and Rogan smiling as if all is well. For a film that is supposed to make me laugh its hard to smile when my heart is so low. Don\u2019t be mistaken this film is enjoyable with a few decent laughs but it isn\u2019t the brilliant comedy that it could have been."

      "text": "This is way overrated. The sex jokes have been done countless times before. The plot is stupid. The acting is mostly bad. The only things that i enjoyed were the fight in the end, and - surprisingly - Zac Efron (it was good seeing him shed the Disney-kid persona and try something different).\r This Is The End was a very good movie that made me enthusiastic for Seth Rogen again. It was one of the reasons that made me check this one out. Unfortunately, I find myself greatly disappointed."

      "text": "An enjoyable, if not, predictable comedy with a fantastic ensemble cast who don't have too much to do. The movie moves along at a brisk pace and the frat boys are funny, yet one-dimensional. Sadly the movie falls into sit-com like scenarios which can be amusing and chuckle worthy, but very forgettable in the long run. The script is paper thin, and the characters story arcs are mere speed bumps in between the comedy. It isn't a game changer in the world of comedy, but there are worse ways to spend your hour and forty.\rSadly, still not the movie that will make me like Rogen, i just dont fing him funny at all, and ive seen most of his movies sadly!"
