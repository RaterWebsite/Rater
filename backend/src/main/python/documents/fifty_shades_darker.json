The script: it's repetitive, with totally forced situations and ridiculous dialogues, Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson have chemistry and showed in other films that the two are good actors, but, with a script like that! How can you act well if your dialogues are so stupid? For example: how can I take seriously a movie that at one point says \"You taught me to **** she taught me how to love\"? The film is repeated again and again in terms of plot and not even the sex scenes are interesting. The movie causes absolutely nothing. The new characters lack depth and time on the screen."

Instead, it acts as a comedy, because it's 2 hours of nothing, with a crashed helicopter scene and a forbidden love (kinda, not really?) that doesn't make any sense. This movie throws some of the most loveable actors (same for the director) in one of the worst performances of 2017.The only good thing (mostly decent, not good) was the soundtrack with Nicki Minaj, Zayn etc. and that's it. In the end, 'Fifty Shades Darker' is another cash-grabby sequel, that has nothing to do with the book. And don't worry, it's worse than 'Fifty Shades Of Grey'."

      "text": "This sequel lacks any of the original's assets (I really liked it. See my review here). The narrative ended with her (Dakota Johnson) walking out on her billionaire beau (Jamie Dornan). Before long, they're back together, which leads to endless intimate discussions about commitment, boundaries and other boring drivel. The dialogue is embarrassingly pedestrian (I was predicting a number of lines before they were uttered). The sex scenes lacked any eroticism (but plenty of nudity) and the S&M component was PG-rated kink. The sprinkling of suspense and disaster feel contrived and add nothing. It doesn't help that the obnoxious soundtrack pounds home the character's emotional state with often ridiculously literal lyrics. Even the scenes of opulence lack visual snap. You'd have to be a true masochist to endure this painful experience. NOTE: If you must go, stay thru the early credits to see a preview of the next one."

      "text": "Okay, I know I am one of those people who go pay to watch \u201cporn\u201d in public, but for the sake of the reviews I felt like this was an important one. Who am I kidding? I love these movies with all their cheap, tacky, cheesy qualities. I\u2019m a sucker for the books and the movies, even though they aren\u2019t wonderful. So I took myself and my best friend for a girls night out the night this movie came out and reveled in all of it\u2019s glory.I was mostly excited for this movie because I really enjoyed the second book, more-so than the first one. There was more of a story, and it was a bit more realistic given some of the qualities of the movies. We start off in this movie after Anastasia and Christian have broken up after the events in the last movie.  She is definitely not over the situation(and how hot Mr. Grey is) and is avoiding all of Christian\u2019s attempts to win her back. Finally, they meet up at Jose\u2019s art gallery, where he weirdly enough has photos of Ana up everywhere. Let\u2019s be real, Christian isn\u2019t the real creep here, Jose is. Anyway, Christian buys all of the photos and asks Ana out for dinner, to which she agrees because when Christian Grey aka Jamie Dornan asks you out to dinner, you say yes.From dinner we see them start up their relationship again, slowly at first, and then very quickly falling back into the couple they were. They attend masquerade balls together, go to dinner, fall in love, basically they do everything that normal couples do in years in a matter of a couple of weeks.Ana starts a new job at a publishing firm and we meet Jack Hyde, her new boss. He\u2019s creepy and is supposed to be kind of an ugly, old guy, but they definitely did not stick to the script. While Eric Johnson was definitely creepy and made me uncomfortable, he wasn\u2019t hard to look at. There are tensions between Ana and Hyde from the beginning, and even more tension between Hyde and Christian. Hyde makes it seemingly impossible to work for him and even more impossible to feel comfortable. Throughout the film we also meet Mrs. Robinson who Kim Basinger so eloquently brought to life. She was who I pictured when reading the book, and she made her on screen counterpart just as devious as she was in the book. Rita Ora was an odd choice for me as Mia, but I was pleasantly surprised by the choice. I imagined Mia with a more youthful, innocent presence.Let\u2019s talk about sex, baby. No, but for real. Let\u2019s talk about the sex in this movie. I don\u2019t care what anyone says about how bad the movies are, the sex is good. At least in this one. There isn\u2019t a lot of the BDSM that made so many people so uncomfortable and outraged in the first one. I personally was the most excited for the elevator scene, and I think it did it justice. There were some laughable intimate moments, of course the movies are kind of cheesy and not the books weren\u2019t very well written to begin with. But I love that even in those moments, the actors don\u2019t break character.My final thoughts, because I don\u2019t want to give up any spoilers as usual, are on all of the lipstick they put on Dakota Johnson. I\u2019m halfway convinced this movie was just a really long lipstick ad and I am LIVING for it. I have went as far as I can and have written down every lipstick type and shade she has on in that movie to buy. I need them all and I\u2019m convinced that if she can wear them while being as risque and fabulous as she is, then I can wear them sitting in my office at my desk. But that could also be the part of me that thinks Dakota Johnson is the most perfect human being in the entire world. As far as a side by side comparison to the book, there were a few semi-important scenes left out, and a few things were different, but overall it stands up next to its literary counterpart pretty well. I know most people hate these movies and love to laugh at them, or do like my sister and watch them on Crappy Movie Monday, but I can\u2019t help but love them. I will watch it again, and I will revel in its terrible glory all over again."

      "text": "The sequel takes everything bad about the first and amplifies it. Any depth of the first is largely gone in the second, character development is null outside of the minimal development from Anna and Christian. The secondary characters are so forgetful that even familiar faces are little more than extras. The entirety of the script is centered around getting form point a to point b, with both of those points being sex. Anna and Christian fight, sex. Anna and Christian are happy, sex. Christian gets into a helicopter crash, sex. It seems the whole world's problems can be solved by sex in this world.The cinematography is actually pretty decent, as is the soundtrack. Unfortunately the song choices rarely make sense for the mood of the scene unlike the first.Listen, I'm not telling you to avoid this, I'm not telling you to watch it either. This is the movie equivalent of Taco Bell, it's okay to consume on occasion, but it should be avoided with any regularity."

Buying Ana\u2019s company unexpectedly and unnecessarily transferring money to her bank account, as well as knowing her account number is downright creepy as heck. After all that, he proposes her to marry him and she said yes. My primary reaction to that is \u201cWTAF?!\u201d She\u2019s going to marry some dude who stalks her a lot and just uses her to fulfill his own desires.Plus, the disappointing parts of the film is the gender-biased sex positions. No woman on top?! Not even once??!! CTFO!!! This is why I\u2019m appalled of watching films that deal with this kind of **** After knowing more of his former submissives and childhood trauma, my opinion on Christian Grey and the book series remain the same. He is nothing but a deep-seated sadistic and goddamn conniving **** and the books deliver a misconstrued concept of romance.I won\u2019t be surprised if it's nominated for the Golden Raspberry Awards."

      "text": "Where Are \"Hearts & Flowers\"?Two years ago, Universal Pictures agreed to display the preceding unreasoning erotic-romance adaptation thought up by British E. L. James, such recklessness led to a storm of dissimilar opinions between movie critics and audience, however, and deplorably the most transcendental for the film production company, was a rotund monetary attainment, not only in its homeland but in the whole world, in part by its relentless readers and partly by its strategic launch date.Valentine's day is the picked day for releasing Jamie Dornan' and Dakota Johnson's sadomasochistic fair tale. Numerous are irrational alterations within this sequel, nonetheless, the germination of all these changes lies in its hard directional shift, as Taylor-Wood hand her director chair over to the filmmaker of some episodes of well-liked TV series, James Foley.Even though \"Fifty Shades\" wasn't well-received by most film critics, one of the most relevant swaps with the original novel was the very light but pertinent conversion in Anna's identity, the main female role. On the pages, she's fragile and more permissive; on the other hand, her effigy on screen is romantic but self-reliant, a suffragist but submissive woman, and although her mission about women's empowerment did not work, it gives something moderately axiomatic away from denigrated trilogy of James. That is probably the main conflict of the latest installment, the austere and fussy accuracy to the reference book. This time, the intrepid woman who opposed the selfsame creator has gone, foolishly, Niall Leonard, Mitchell's husband, writes and sketches empty, futile and even squalid contingencies and characters.The motion picture in question takes place ridiculously three weeks after what has happened, and I say \"ridiculous\" by unconnected and soporific distortions between the leading roles; in just three weeks, Mr. Grey suddenly forgets his firm sexual priorities to become into the authentic submissive of the storyline, in which Anastasia Steele looks more experienced, more libidinous and superficially more greedy. Fallible resolutions go on in the hands of three idle and anodyne antagonists, who covet to fracture the happy new relationship, at the same time that Grey struggles with his intrinsic shades of yesterday and today.\"Darker\", this is evidently the wrong term. Even the film opens with an involuntary self-parody about its suggestive title, are some alba roses too dark? Such name is only one tactic more in order to insinuate improving previous flaws, however, the only thing that they get is to underline them with darker ink.Leonard and Foley are a dangerous duo for the romance genre, and this should not be taken as a compliment. On this occasion, they coat it a dismal, unsatisfactory and unfounded thriller aroma; a series of circumstances poorly posed, developed and resolved. Besides, new characters inclusion is simply execrable, providing irregular performances and a limited runtime on screen for revealing their talents.Despite the unfathomable dissatisfaction I felt, there is another portion which we can praise. The first one, openly, is its protagonist. Although Johnson can't save all the footage, she does not allow her character from drowning in that sea of insipidness and boredom, on the other hand, gives it a particular empathy. Another satisfactory feature is the partial revelation of Christian's dismal past, even accompanied by flashbacks, hence he achieved a longer participation.In technical aspects, we can see major improvements within staging with regard to the previous film, with soft but amended erotic overtures, that even if they do not reach the expected level of arousal, it delivers elaborated challenges. Likewise, fireworks, masks, sex toys, parties, restaurants, Grey's remodeled penthouse and the usual Seattle aerial shots are perceived differently due to their nocturnal and attractive tones. Like its predecessor, sound support is vital both harmonizing the sensual shots and decorating fickle moments. Although the dreamlike rhythms of Legend, Sia, Swift or composer Danny Elfman do not convince for another Academy Awards nomination, they fit with complacency within artistically precious scenes.\"Darker\" destabilizes first movie spectacular expectations due to reduced chemistry of its lead actors, its poorly constructed ambitions and a series of failed elections which lose out the limited potential of James' erotic books. Grey needs to marry, forget his past and be an ordinary boyfriend, reveal his shades; Anastasia wants to be the boss of the publishing house, yearns for redeeming men with psychological problems, now he's who wants flowers and hearts and she wants to **** hard. An ex-submissive lurking, a stalker boss and a grown up lady try to end the relationship; with its dull ending, \"Darker\" insinuates becoming into a thriller of killers instead of romantic frippery that it should aspire to be."

It had all of the romance, emotion, suspense & of course the sex that the first one lacked. Great job with the screenplay because trying to get everything from the book into a 2 hour movie would dilute the story too much , so I understand why certain characters or stories were left out or changed. Would have maybe touched base with the psychiatrist as a character in the movie so you could truly understand how much emotional effort Christian is making to change for the better . I'm not quit sure why the critics are so harsh. Maybe they just don't understand the premise of this beautiful unique love story. Look ... this isn't supposed to be an academy award nominated movie, if you want that , then def see Lion, ( which absolutely deserves to win for best picture) . In any case , I enjoyed this movie much more then some of the critically acclaimed movies that I went to because of the critic's ratings. That's why if you ??Christian & Anastasia's love story then you will absolutely enjoy this movie. It went by fast, was a fun movie to see & like the books , I was sad it was over. I would even see it again . Def will purchase it when it comes out on DVD."

Do you go watch Super-Hero-Movie #4000 for its oh-so realistic depiction of daily life? Don't think so buddy. So why hold this movie to randomly high standards instead of taking it for the silly fantasy that it is. At the end of the day the acting is good and the actors can make you care about the characters, and if you're into this sort of thing you can have a good time or even laugh at the absurdity of it all, or both why not."

      "text": "The next fifty shades between an ordinary woman and a billionaire.The film was not received well as the book was. Just like the first film, it has been another below average. Might be because of its theme. Usually this kind of films do great business, but ratings and reviews does not praise or encourage the film. So I doubt anybody will be bored of it, which means watchable film and instead it won't be their favourite.The story continued and this time it was not based on experiment or any kind of agreement, but mutual understanding. So the billionaire Grey and Ana's erotic adventure sustains. With the small-small developments the film goes all the way to the ending. That means, those who are watching it for the selected scenes, will surely would have a nice time. But nothing was strong as any European film on the similar theme.Apart from the weak storyline, there's nothing wrong with it. As to what this film is about, it served better. That's what I say to you not to expect full storied romance-drama. As usual the actors were good and another two films to come in the 'Fifty Shades' franchise. I hope they can be better than the first two. Overall, it is only for the selected audience, but curiosity makes everybody watch it and they all pour they perspective which is flooded with average to negative. Otherwise, it is an acceptable film.6/10"

      "text": "Worse is difficult...This film is the more-than-announced continuation of the Fifty Shades trilogy, and I think it's the worst of the three films. Despite the great success of the box office, in my view largely based on the previous success of the books by E. L. James, the film was precisely booed by both the critics and the public who paid to see it. As I did in the critique of the first film, I emphasize here that I neither read nor intend to read the original books, so I will only speak about the film, although I know that many problems related to the story told already come from the original material.After breaking up with Gray, Anastasia decides to resume with him, but under conditions. Her personality changed a lot from one film to the next. She is no longer that shy girl who is unable to break a plate that we saw in the first film. She discovered her own femininity, is more confident and dominates the situation with confidence, almost to the point of reversing sexual roles with Gray. This, in turn, seems lost and not quite sure where to step, in search of firm ground. This was what surprised me most in the story told by the film. The rest (the intrigues and jealousy involving Anastasia's boss and Gray's ex-lover, or even Leila's enigmatic appearance) does not have half the interest that this change in their personality had for me. And the film also has terrible dialogues and one of the most lurid lapses of continuity I have ever seen in cinema: the complicated lingerie that Anastasia takes to the Gray's charity party and that, already on the spot, in yet another sex scene, has mysteriously disappeared of her body, leaving only a simple lacy underwear. I almost burst out laughing. Is there anything good here? Yes, but little. The performance of the two central actors in the plot is noticeably less boring than in the first film, but, as seen earlier, the impersonality and the lack of passion and chemistry between them dominates; Marcia Gay Harden did a good performance as Christian's mother and Kim Basinger was also good at the little he had to doIt goes without saying that this film is totally inappropriate for children and teenagers, given the heavy erotic material and the language used. The film had a good budget and, therefore, good production values, starting with good photography, good scene props, satisfactory editing work and a good soundtrack, composed by Danny Elfman."

      "text": "'Fifty Shades Darker' pretty much retains all the problems of its prequel: long, boring, empty and repeated scenes which all say the same thing except with a different lavish product-placement filled background. But this time there is no mystery, and the few new characters that are presented to us are barely given any focus.This is a new problem this film has. It wastes its focus on the wrong parts. Sure, Anastasia (Dakota Johnson) and Christian (Jamie Dornan) are the main characters, but the subject of Christian's condition is so milked that they simply have nothing to talk about and instead they repeat the same subjects and conversations over and over again. Occasionally we get a sex scene, of course, but they are all the same, yet treated with such attention that we are sucked into their void. \"Take me to the red room\" - Anastasia says at some point like its a big deal. She already was there.But back to the nude scenes. I thought of counting them, but then I remembered my lazy bottom didn't bother to count the number of cuts in 'Werckmeister Harmonies', a film I gave a 10; so, out of respect (and the fact that I didn't really care, to be honest) I didn't. The number is not important. At how boring these scenes are even two are too many. And there were more; that I know. I mean, I am a 22-year-old sexual hormone-filled teenager, and I am honestly sick of seeing Dakota Johnson nude stumbling around Christian Grey's opulent apartment/mansion/castle-whatever.But back to the nude scenes again (or rather one of them). In the scene where he finally takes her to the \"infamous\" red room, yet again we are presented with a boring, safe sex scene. I mean, he's got all that stuff lying around. Is like that episode of Looney Tunes where the rat exterminator comes in, proceeds to lay out all his tools on the floor, and then only uses a tiny trap and then leaves. That was funny and this scene was too (like many scenes), but here I don't believe the humor is intentional.There are three characters which are interesting: that is Leila (Bella Heathcote), a physically harmed girl coming to take vengeance on Anastasia; Eric Johnson giving a pretty good performance as Jack Hyde, Anastasia's boss and Kim Basinger as Elena Lincoln, the woman who first exposed Christian to sado-masochism. But we barely get any focus on them. Leila only appears in three scenes: first, a brief meet with Anastasia then she goes full Batman mode watching Christian and Anastasia sleep (I am still wondering how she got into the apartment) and her 'reveal' is a huge let-down. Same can be said for the rest of the characters.In the end, I guess the reason director James Foley decided to do this, was to artificially extend the plot and to make this a trilogy. This might be a good business move, but its a shameless one when it comes to the art. Yet there were moments, minutes literally, where 'Fifty Shades Darker' peaked my interest - like the scene in which Christian shows his dark side when Anastasia meets Leila or when she is harassed by Jack. But these are way too brief and instead we get a rich and empty showcase of opulence. This film could have been more. This really is a waste."
