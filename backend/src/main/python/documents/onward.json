      "text": "The talks of \"B-tier Pixar\" rearing its ugly head yet again are lost on me when it comes to \"Onward,\" director Dan Scanlon's second feature-length effort (after the uninspired \"Monster University\"). This may come off as an entry into the \"hot take Olympics,\" but I honestly found the film more creative, entertaining and emotionally resonant than Pixar's last effort, \"Toy Story 4.\" It, at the very least, justifies it's own existence better than that film did. There's a genuinely beautiful and original message at the center of this story here that culminates into what's easily the best ending to a Pixar movie I've seen since \"Coco.\" \"Toy Story 4\" tried this, but ultimately ended up doing the same \"saying goodbye because it's the right thing to do\" type of ending that \"Toy Story 3\" did. I don't mean to bag on \"Toy Story 4\" so much, but I think we all hold these movies to a certain standard. Mine were just about met with \"Onward.\" Each set piece is engaging and memorable, the world feels lived in and different, even the progression of the narrative surprised me with how much it hearkened back to early Pixar. I guess I'm in the minority on this one, but I very much enjoyed this."

This isn\u2019t some cynical fantasy story with an annoying brother. It\u2019s a great coming of age, sibling story wrapped in classic Dungeons and Dragons (quite literally in several scenes and monsters).See it, it\u2019s worth it.

      "text": "Again, Pixar comes up with a rather fresh concept, fantasy creatures in a modern times world, with some strong emotional moments. It was an excellent idea to make the film about the two brothers Ian (voiced by Tom Holland) and Barley (Chris Pratt) going on a quest to briefly reunite with the the late father they never knew or barely remember. It is a very heartfelt tale: wanting to connect with a relative you never knew. The connection between the two brothers (one's the shy guy who isn't into magic but can do it and the other is the outgoing, immature one who is into magic but can't do it) is handled really well. The ending may be up there with some of Pixar's great moments.The movie has a fine cast of characters and voice actors. Chris Pratt is the VIP here. Yeah, he is doing a variation of the typical Pratt kind of character, but he is good enough that Barley is distinguishable from his other characters. He especially does a well with Barley's more sympathetic moments.I was a little at odds at whether I should rate this a little higher. Ultimately I realized that while this is up there with some of Pixar's better films this wasn't in their top tier. Onward is mostly a road trip movie and it had the issues that I felt were in Up or some of Pixar's other road trip movies in that the creators have some great core ideas but feel like they were throwing in whatever they could to fill out the movie. This could've been shorter and the third act in particular feels like the film is stretching. There are also moments where Ian, when he's being shy or angry, is too underwritten or stereotypically portrayed.I'm not the biggest fan of the character design in this. It feels a little simple compared to other Pixar films almost as if this was designed by a different studio. I know that a lot of animators prefer more simple designs because it makes animating or character expression easier. Personally as a viewer, I prefer when a character looks better defined. I especially don't like the way they made the elves' tragus in their ears. (The part of the outer ear that sort of covers the earhole). They look like quarters.Criticisms aside when this movie is good it's really good, and I highly recommend it."

The part between the Tavern and the draw bridge is pretty slow. It\u2019s not bad, but it\u2019s just okay. It\u2019s the only part of the movie that wasn\u2019t super engaging to me, simply due to characters (the bikers) being fairly boring.Every other part was great. The humor is there throughout the entire movie. While there are some areas where the humor isn\u2019t original, the amount of original jokes and unique gags far outnumber them. Colt Stallion (boyfriend) was a funny, original portrayal of a Minotaur that consistently made the theatre laugh. Chris Pratt did an amazing job in his role, and never failed to get a laugh.Not only is the movie funny, it\u2019s also the most emotional Pixar movie since UP (yes I think it\u2019s more emotional than Coco). The ending manages to be something you wouldn\u2019t expect, and that\u2019s not a bad thing at all. I like the approach it took, and it had several people around me in tears. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the ending of Coco was emotional, but I don\u2019t think it came close to what this movie did.The foreshadowing starts from the very get go of the movie, with the dragon on the school (I won\u2019t go in depth on this to avoid spoilers). Another great thing this movie was able to accomplish was a scene that managed to be funny, epic, and majestic all at the same time. Once again, I won\u2019t go in depth here to avoid spoilers, but it\u2019s definitely my favorite scene in the movie.It\u2019s not a perfect movie, but it comes close to it. The movie is filled with humor, emotion, lessons, family values, heart wrenching moments, and epic scenes."

As for the rest Julia Louis-Dreyfus was great as Laurel, a determined super mum that wants nothing more for a her 2 boys to be happy and is prepared to go great lengths to make sure they\u2019re safe, Octavia Spencer was brilliant as The Manticore, a character that you thought would be a bit intimidating and villainous that was actually pretty funny and awesome to watch. The animations & sets were gorgeous and I don\u2019t care one bit if they maybe did look a bit too realistic, the fact that Pixar has the power & talent to put that much detail into their movies nowadays I think is really commendable and something I personally think they should definitely keep up.So overall I\u2019m really happy with this movie, I\u2019m definitely seeing again at some point down the line and if they ever plan to make a sequel it, bringeth it on I say(Also shoutout to whoever at Pixar had the idea of Barley being a metalhead)"

A spell that will let him meet him for only one day. Unfortunately the spell only half works and him and his brother have to go on a quest so make him whole before time runs out. The movie is funny, sad and heartwarming without being too preachy. At times it can feel a bit familiar but overall it's another solid addition to Pixar's library.

I am after all, a mostly adult man. But seriously who is Onward for? It's really lazy in story and character. It takes this fantastical premise and setting and makes it super boring. What if dungeons and dragons were real and set in the real world? Sounds exciting right? Well turns out its exactly like our real world but people look different and there's magic but not a lot of magic so it really doesn't mean much. Cooooooool. It's honestly so freaking boring I can't believe it made it past the script phase, someone at Disney or Pixar should have been like... this is a sitcom episode from the 1950's with elf people. Do we really have anything to say with this? Omg why do the brothers have so much reverence for their dad when he was literally never around and their mom has zero screen time to actually share why their dad was awesome. It's just blind male hero worship without introspection. Also why the heck would you chose the bottom half to materialize from a story standpoint??? If the top half materialized then at least you can have some engaging character work and the brothers have to learn how to take care of others (and of course dumb comedy happenings) but instead we get the uncharismatic legs and feet wandering around like a useless plot device. Sigh. Pixar has really fell from grace."

I would say: \"Kind of\".\"Onward\" ended up being a pretty good movie, with some creative ideas, some funny moments and some emotional moments. The world the movie is set in has potential, but visually speaking, there's nothing memorable in it. Besides the design of the houses, I guess, the world lacks any style or personality. The voice acting is decent, I guess. Tom Holland was playing himself...I couldn't stop hearing Spider-Man. I guess the director just told him \"Act as if you're playing Spider-Man\" and that's it. Chris Pratt was annoying at first, but I later got used to his voice. It has some themes and underlying messages that were presented in a nice way. Some of them in an enotional way and others in a funny way.The story is fun, highly energetic and emotional at times, even if some of the emotional moments were more cheesy than emotional.I liked it overall but the story just feels so formulaic and familiar. Sure it had some twists I didn't see coming and the movie could've been a lot more predictable and boring but it almost seems like Pixar is stuck in the same plot structure for many its movies. I mean, it was an enjoyable experience, I bursted out laughing many times but I don't feel that it had that \"Pixar magic\" in it."

This film showcases why we love Pixar so much. The characters make sense given the situation. It can be really difficult to sympathies with characters in fantastical setting at times putting the pressure on the writer to make the charterers fit in with the world as well making them feel real to the audience and this film manages to do it no problem. The story is also very compelling. Fans of D&D will love the not so subtle reverences to R.P.Gs made through out the film, while others will enjoy the family aspects of the film. However this film does have it's fair share of flaws especially with the rules involving it's own magic. There are plenty times when the film fails to explain why it's magic doesn't work in a certain way. Yet This doesn't take away from my overall enjoyment of the film. Also there is the problem that this film though original in concept isn't all that original in execution. Again however, this did not bother me much. In conclusion if your looking for a good animated film that has something for everyone than this is the film for you."
