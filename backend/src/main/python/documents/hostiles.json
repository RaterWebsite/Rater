      "text": "The film\u2019s title is a conundrum. Who are the true hostiles, the Native Americans or the American settlers? A seasoned army captain is asked to escort an aging and sick Cheyenne chief (Wes Studi) and his family back to their homeland in Montana, after having endured seven years of prison for war crimes. Captain Joseph Blocker, played by Christian Bale, balks to the point where he is threatened with court-martial, prison, and a loss of his pension if he does not obey the orders that come directly from U.S. President Benjamin Harrison in the year 1892.But things have changed since the Battle of Wounded Knee, in which Blocker had fought. Back East, influential citizens have begun what would evolve into the long and slow process of the United States government paying reparations and making official apologies to indigenous peoples. The popular advocacy on behalf of Native Americans was in its infant stages. The Indians were wronged by the white settlers; they were dispossessed; their lands were stolen from them; they suffered indignity and they died in droves from white man\u2019s diseases. Laws were passed prohibiting their spiritual practices. It was just a handful of voices, but President Harrison was being harassed by prominent citizens. Under political pressure, the President ordered Chief Yellow Hawk and his family to be released from prison and escorted home.Blocker had seen slaughters conducted by Indians in his long career as a U.S. soldier. He mistrusts Yellow Hawk, but the military commander is forced to accept orders, and the journey of a thousand miles begins. Against all odds, Yellow Hawk becomes an unexpected source of wisdom and support. Early on the travelers meet a victim of the Comanche Indians, a young widow, Rosalee Quaid (Rosalind Pike), out of her mind with grief because her cabin in the middle of an empty plain had been burnt down, her husband and three children murdered as she miraculously escaped. The trek on horseback to Chief Yellow Hawk\u2019s sacred homeland, where he is eventually buried, is disturbed by Comanche attacks, deserters, and abduction. When the group finally arrives in Montana, we receive a brief tutorial on the history of gun violence in the United States. There is a shootout on the sacred Indian land which is privately owned by a crazy, gun-toting, white senior who threatens to kill the entire party if they don\u2019t get off his land. (Americans are suffering the legacy of this mentality to this day in Texas, where ambiguous legislation allows gun owners to take the law into their own hands.)The movie has all the elements for greatness in the genre of Westerns and nearly achieves it. Christian Bale is a force of nature; Rosalind Pike is a pillar of feminist strength. With their wordless romance, fate decrees that Rosalee is compensated for her losses. But there are historical inaccuracies and questions to deal with. Conflicts with Comanches ended in the 1870\u2019s when the last Comanche bands surrendered to the U.S. Army. The character of Rosalee is educated and no stranger to fashion; it\u2019s not clear why she and her husband built a log cabin exposed in the middle of isolated and dangerous territory. And there were trains and stagecoaches they could have taken for their journey to Montana; civilization was right around the corner in 1892. The fictional plot is a bit of an anachronism. Nevertheless the broader story of racism, misappropriated land, and the destruction of Native American culture is historically accurate, and these issues still have implications in the present."

      "text": "This movie is a slow paced emotion roller coaster with a really strong message which apparently was not clear enough for most people because this movie is too under rated. It really had that feel of the raw wild west and was not exaggerated to better fit the silver screen. The events of the plot are kept simple but brutally realistic and  filled with raw emotion and consequences. The acting was really amazing, especially with Christian Bale's solid but soft under performance of Joe. The writing was simple enough but still held value and emotions. The music helped the immersion, and was really not exaggerated on the over the top action scenes. But the scenes where still \"heavy\". The directing style was great amazingly executed as well, with on point cinematography. There is to much humanity in this movie to ignore the artistic value hidden in this movie and the deep message of life and solidarity/empathy. The visuals and the sights where this movie was shot was a real jaw drop for most of the audience, with pixel perfect practical effects. The pacing was a little slow at the end, but it can be argued that that is due to the immersion creating and tension full scenes if we have the patience with the unfolding of the plot. Overall it's an amazing movie which in my humble opinion deserved a lot more from the critics, because they oversaw the real/raw artistic value in this movie. But I did this from general audience. Still..."

I enjoyed the overall balance and tone of the film.It\u2019s gritty, and violent, but not to insane extremes or excessively so IMO. It avoids the American patriots vs. the savages of old Westerns, and also avoids the Americans are evil and the Natives are just peaceful hippies who are kind to everyone like in that inane borefest Dances with Wolves. This film shows that there were hard and violent men capable of great and terrible things on both sides. This not only makes the story authentic and historically accurate, but it also makes it more of a film about humanity and I think it has an appeal that transcends the Western genre. The lanscapes and cinemetography were beautiful and I think people who don\u2019t usually watch Westerns could enjoy this film. One of the best Westerns ever IMO and one of the top movies of 2017 along with Dunkirk and BR 2049."

This also isn\u2019t a \u2018spoiler\u2019 because it is so unbelievable!Christian Bale is excellent and though there was talk of his getting an Oscar nomination he didn\u2019t which is as senseless as Denzel Washington getting one for his role in \u201cRoman J.

Rosamund Pike does what she can with the \u2018damsel in distress\u2019 role while no one leaves an impression in any of the other roles.\u201cHostiles\u201d is in the same category as \u201cPhantom Thread\u201d in that except for the leading actor neither are worth seeing."

I am not quite sure how you would market this very fine film since it is basically a traditional Western without any special plot twists. I guess what I mean is that it is not very original. It simply has a solid cast and direction \u2013 and a certain very sad and \u201clyrical\u201d quality. No big shoot-outs, no clich\u00e9s, but a great atmosphere that kept me and the rest of the audience spellbound, quiet, and motionless for over two hours."

      "text": "Hostiles is a movie that certainly lives up to its title. Directed by Scott Cooper, starring Christian Bale and Rosamund Pike. Set in 1892, an army captain (Bale) must escort a Cheyenne chief (Wes Studi) and his family through dangerous territory and back to their home.We don't get many Westerns these days so I try not to miss the chance to see one and if you enjoy Westerns at all then under no circumstance should you miss this. Bleak and devastating, Hostiles doesn't hold back, doesn't ease the constant sense of impending doom. The vast landscape and the character's emotional torment is emphasised in the mesmerizing film score. Although the pacing can be a little slow at times the story captured me from the opening scene. What movie fan doesn't love a good Western and Hostiles is everything you'd expect. The story moves in a way you'd anticipate, yet what makes it memorable is Rosamund Pike and Christian Bale. Their performances allows you to feel every ounce of pain their characters are going through. Emotional, very atmospheric and highly recommended."

      "text": "As I watched these actors slowly plodding through their perilous journey on horseback, I pondered the tedium of travelling at that pace. Ironically, it became an analogy for the movie, which moves very slowly, with generous pauses and lovely scenery. Christian Bale plays a rugged, closed-down Army Captain in the Wild West of the late 1800s. He's assigned to escort a Cheyenne chief to his family home. Along the way, he encounters a woman, who's alone after her family was slaughtered by Comanches. Their trek not only presents numerous challenges, but engenders discussion from several angles about race and humankind's cruelty. The performances are earnest, esp. Bale's stolid soldier. There are compelling moments of emotional impact and philosophical contemplation, but it requires patience to appreciate the film's complex moral arguments and quiet revelations."

Scott Cooper directing, a cast featuring Christian Bale, Timothee Chalamet, Rosamund Pike, and Jesse Plemons among others, a killer script. What went wrong? The finished movie feels like a direct-to-tv feature that is completely rushed. There's a lot of hammy over acting that distracts from the story, such as Christian Bale screaming at his gun as he \"contemplates\" suicide, Rosamund Pike burying her children, and Timothee Chalamet grunting \"BITUH\" when he gets shot in the shoulder. It's a weird, meandering movie that feels way too long. I can only recommend this if you are bored on Netflix and have nothing else to watch."

The screen writer and director, Scott Cooper might be doing some of his best work but is trapped in a tale that barely has enough concrete material to demand attention from the audience let along entertain them. As mentioned earlier, if there is anything plausible in this feature its the performance by Christian Bale; at the heart of it does his best but isn't provided enough range to flaunt it, and Rosamund Pike. Hostiles breeds power over authority, minority and humanity which isn't expressed to its best on paper which then results into a hollow and unsatisfying experience on screen."

      "text": "Hostiles is not one of those movies that you walk into expecting a happy, fun time. It was very clear from the trailers that this was going to be a hardcore Western, and it is just that. It is about a Union solider (who specializes in killing Indians) transporting an Indian Chief back to his home, after all. The tone is set in the very first scene and it stays for the entirety of the runtime. It's a film about brutality and the cost of it. It gives a realistic portrayal of how hard and unpredictable a journey could be back in the western days. It also shows how even the most dedicated adversaries can become trusting companions under the right circumstances. This is a long film, and I could feel how long it was due to the slower pace, but that's not entirely surprising considering it's a Western. Plus, I think that the slower pace worked for this film. It helped make me feel like I was actually on a long journey with the characters, and the extended amount of time with them made me truly care for them by the end. I also have to give major props to Christian Bale for his performance in this film. I truly think it's worthy of an Oscar nomination, but he didn't get one. The rest of the cast was great as well.In the end, I think that Hostiles is a fantastic Western. Unfortunately, the longer run time and the brutal story makes it hard for it to appeal to a huge audience, but there's no doubt in my mind that Western fans will find that this film will satisfy their need for a solid, new Western."

I don't like westerns or civil war films (except for \"Gone With The Wind\"), and the trailer didn't make this film appealing to me. I like films that entertain. However, I gave in and quickly realized it was Christian Bale (I don't know why my boyfriend confuses Bale with Brolin), who was very unlikable at first. After a slow beginning, the story becomes very compelling and it doesn't matter that it's a western or whatever this movie is. The story is about human dignity and what it takes to get along with people who don't look like you, or think like you. As the story progresses, both sides gain respect for the other as they endure the same horrible situations. Wish more people were really like that during trying times and still able to show empathy and caring. The end of the film was a bit of a tease on what was going to happen next, and we're glad the film ended the way it did. On top of a compelling story (at least the story was compelling for us), it has great acting, and wonderful scenery. I wish I knew where they filmed. The cinematography was gorgeous!"

The cinematography is great, but not quite as good as it was with the previous mentioned \"Dances wtih Wolves\", but still some breath taking scenes! The story is riveting and as myself had the whole audience glued to the screen, even at some of the quieter moments you could hear a pin drop. The stories dialouge at the onset was hard to follow at times, but once Captain Joseph Blocker had his orders to deliver his hated enemy Chief Yellow Hawk to his home the story quickened and never let you go on thier perilous journey across country. I found the relationships with the Captain's other fellow officers to be deep and well thought out, along with the deep seated history that they had experienced in the past with the so called hostiles. I can't give alway too much as I don't want to be a spoiler, but the story that unfolded following years of prejudice and hatred was one to remember as they all had to look deep into their souls! There are so many moments in the movie that will make you want to reflect on perhaps some of your own experiences. Kudo's to director Scott Cooper, the script, and actors for weaving this into a real gem. Wanted to give it a 10, but in the end I gave it a 9 due to some slow dialouge in the beginning, and a few slow spots that could have been edited or left behind.

      "text": "Without saying the words Hostiles asks some pretty heavy questions about human behaviour during times of war and the subsequent trauma that comes from surviving such violent events. The idea of branding someone an enemy dehumanizing them as a justification of the violence you then inflict. This well produced film, much like its subject matter seems to thoughtfully question the intent of its characters. Despite this however something doesn't seem to gel in the films pacing and script. As a result we're left with an interesting yet pretty dreary and serious movie."

Un western bourr\u00e9 d\u2019incoh\u00e9rences, tout cela pour se fondre dans le moule format\u00e9 du vivre_ensemble et du bisounoursisme neuneu : ainsi, ce capitaine particuli\u00e8rement haineux et raciste qui a tu\u00e9 tant de \u00ab peaux rouges \u00bb\u2026 devient comme par magie un gentil bisounours pr\u00eat \u00e0 tuer de bons Am\u00e9ricains pour d\u00e9fendre les gentils Am\u00e9rindiens ! une fausse \u00ab r\u00e9demption \u00bb pour un boucher pourtant connu et reconnu\u2026Idem ou presque pour le r\u00f4le de Rosamund Pike, une cocotte traumatis\u00e9e (par des Comanches pas gentils) mais qui devient selon le dogme SJW woke moderne une adepte du \u00ab vous n\u2019aurez pas ma haine \u00bb\u2026 Hostiles est donc en d\u00e9finitive comme cet autre film ridicule, le fameux American History X, \u00e0 savoir compl\u00e8tement aberrant, ang\u00e9liste et wokiste \u00e0 fond.Et pourtant la forme est r\u00e9ussie (bien que trop contemplative), la musique est planante (un peu soporifique quand m\u00eame) et la photographie est superbe. Mais quelle lenteur par ailleurs\u2026 et tout \u00e7a pour nous noyer sous une litanie SJW !"

      "text": "Gruesome, brutal and shocking. A strong stomach is required as this movie will test how much missery you can take from watching a movie.In 1892, a Union captain with a track record of killing many indians and having a serious hate towards them, is tasked with bringing a dying chief to his sacred burial land. Even though the captain objects fiercely, he will bring the chief and his family to the Valley of the Bears in Montana. On the way there the group will suffer many obstacles and brutality, eventually culminating into a redemption arc for the captain.The story of the movie is interesting, and while being very gruesome it will keep you entertained. Watching the movie i got quite confused who was the biggest culprit of violence: The indians, or the colonists? The movie itself seems to lean towards the colonists. As for negatives, the slow pacing of the movie will test your patience. For some reason the movie is incredibely muted, forcing me to turn up the volume of my tv 3 fold.The acting is convincing, and so are the overgrown moustaches. Although the movie doesn't have a good ending, the redemption arc itself brings joy as you watch the movie. I give this movie a 7/10."

It's a good drama/western still, I just wished that there would've been less dragging out of screen-time."
