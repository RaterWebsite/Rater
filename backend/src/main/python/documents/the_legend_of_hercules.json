  "description": "In Ancient Greece 1200 B.C., a queen succumbs to the lust of Zeus to bear a son promised to overthrow the tyrannical rule of the king and restore peace to a land in hardship. But this prince, Hercules, knows nothing of his real identity or his destiny. He desires only one thing: the love of Hebe, Princess of Crete, who has been promised to his own brother. When Hercules learns of his greater purpose, he must choose: to flee with his true love or to fulfill his destiny and become the true hero of his time. The story behind one of the greatest myths is revealed in this action-packed epic - a tale of love, sacrifice and the strength of the human spirit.",

Hercules suddenly teleports from a boat to a desert and from a desert to a \"fighting.....place?\"\r The plot is basically nonexistent, the movie consists of Hercules going from bloodless battle to bloodless battle and doggy paddling across a shocking number of bodies of water(They could have at least got an actor who could swim)\r At the end of the movie Hebe, the generic love interest, stabs a dagger through her shoulder and into Hercules' brother, she somehow survives for long enough to say her final words, while the brother is dead instantly. Then suddenly the scene changes and you can hear a crying baby. The camera zooms in and Hebe is holding it. It literally never explained how this happened. NEVER! You can't just have somebody die and then show them alive in the next scene, that makes no sense!\r This movie is overall on atrocity. The only reason it got a one was one amusing scene where hercules got kicked in the face at a dramatic moment."

The forced romance scenes were numerous and unbearable. Once the characters actually had to speak dialogue it became even more painful. Also they must have run out of ideas with the Gladiator remake portion where they fight for their freedom. The guy who played Hercules has no acting skills and it shows. They just found some guy with a good body and handed him a script it seems. Just overall really poor. Also, the ending scene was incredibly stupid. It's as if the writers had to go on lunch break and just killed everyone bad in five seconds and then put in a dash of happy ending. Pathetic."

      "text": "Totally b-movie bad. Probably the worst thing about the movie is that it hard to support Kellan Lutz as Hercules. His performance is lacking, and constantly watching him make stupid faces during the action scenes is agonizing. Lutz isn't the only offender when it comes to bad acting, almost the entire cast sucks. Liam McIntyre gives the only respectable performance, and it's great to see the Spartacus star step back onto the arena sands. Shame about that bowl haircut though.\r While the performances range from lacking to just plain bad, the action is mostly decent. Granted there are countless movies that have done it better, and without constantly having characters goofily being thrown through the air in slow motion, but it's at least watchable. The action scenes are a constant form of unintentional comedic gold. One scene involving a lightning whip is particularly amusing. The action is the only enjoyable part of the film, but entirely for the wrong reasons.\r This is clearly just one huge b-movie. With Lutz failing to make a compelling Hercules in any way, the whole film noticeably suffers more than I feel it otherwise would have. Yes, it would have still suffered from the poor plot and bad acting from the rest of the cast, but had they at least found a half-decent person to play Hercules then maybe there would have at least been reason to overlook a lot of it's flaws and maybe even care about the romance at the center of this film. As it stands now I recommend you skip this one and hope that Dwayne Johnson's upcoming Hercules movie is better later this year. My total score for the film is a 4.2/10=Bad."

Unless it features a Game of Thrones star, I ain't going to pay $10 bucks to watch another Hercules rip-off. I've watched a lot of Hercules way back in the 90's including the Disney version and Hercules: The Legendary Journeys staring the great Kevin Sorbo. How many updated versions of Hercules will they last? I don't know but Hollywood should just keep the Hercules to rest already. The Legend of Hercules features a terrible action hero who really can't act as Hercules, an dimwitted script, funny CGI elements, bland source material, and sometimes even Renny Harlin's Cutthroat Island is still a flop, maybe this one could add to his list of bad movies. He's a great director but needs to bring back Geena Davis and finally make some action movies together. If anyone buying a copy of the movie, please seek therapy. Bottom line: Avoid! Nothing you're going to see here. I just hope that Brett Rattner should be just fine about the new Hercules movie cause I know The Rock is going to kick some ass. I wonder if it's way better than The Mummy Returns or The Scorpion King? Unless for the Razzies for next year, The Legend of Hercules should be able to get more nominations than any stinker on the planet."

      "text": "I was a History major and as such I find these types of films difficult to watch. They are so inaccurate and give people the wrong perception of history, then again, The Legend of Hercules was directed by Renny Harlin, and he wouldn't put his name on any old thing. After praying to Zeus for guidance, Queen Alcmene (Roxanne McKee) is picked to carry the son of God. The King however knows that Hercules (Kellan Lutz) isn't his and commits an act of betrayal that separates Hercules from the woman he loves. When I think of the mighty Hercules, Kellan Lutz isn't the first name that comes to mind, but he does a pretty solid job with the role. The rest of the cast also performed equally well, and for once the cast wasn't the problem. A film like this has a story to tell and that story can't be told in an hour and half. I enjoyed the narrative, but the best parts of the film were so rushed, that I felt slighted. The whole Egyptian angle should have been a major theme, but it only lasts about ten minutes, and before you know it, Herc is fighting for his life is arenas around the world, scenes that were also rushed. The film is very straight forward and far too predictable for a story like this. There are Kings and Gods, legends from thousands of years ago, but no twists or turns? No surprises thrown in for dramatic effect at least? Overall, the film is somewhat entertaining and as I said the cast was good, but The Legend of Hercules flies by at the speed of light, which makes the film difficult to really get behind."

The answer is actually no, it isn't. Having said that it is by no means a great film, but I personally found it more entertaining than say, the po faced 'The Book Thief' or the soon to be marvelled at, but less than marvelous 'Captain America'. It's true the dialogue is uninspired and we have seen all this done before so much better in films like 'Gladiator' and '300' which it is obviously trying to emulate. However, the story is ok if predictable and it doesn't really bore one. Technically the film is more lacking than some. The special effects have a cut price feel to them and the photography comes over as an unfortunate mish mash of styles. The lighting of some scenes resembles cosmetic or shampoo adverts in how they have been shot. Other scenes seem to imply that the weather was not working for the production as they have a washed out desaturated look. I don't think anyone can argue with the fact that Kellan Lutz was built for the part even if an Oscar will not be his any time soon. On the plus side both the music and sound are very good."

I don't know what happened to the director, he used to make the better movies in his early career and now he lost his way. Maybe the big stars don't believe in him that may lead him to recruit second stream actors.\r The romance portions were too bad, no chemistry, physics, mathematics, nothing, but just an ordinary without the feelings. When it comes to the game of throne, that's looked okay as it scripted like 'snakes and ladders' game. Anyway, it was a well known story among most of us which was altered and told somewhat differently. Disappoint is there though still somehow watchable.\r Don't force yourself for this, because you are not going to miss any masterpiece. It's becoming a habit in Hollywood, like I already mentioned in a review a year ago that two same thematic movies coming out of a same period. So this time Dwayne Johnson's movie wins the race, according to the ratings and reviews across the internet, but I still have to see it first before compare them both."

      "text": "Wow... I'm so f*cking outraged right now. I have a new contender for the worst movie of the year, and it's The Legend of F*cking Hercules. Although \"Transformers: Age of Exinction\" gets an honorable mention, this one really takes the cake. Let me start by saying that Hercules himself is portrayed by a guy who doesn't know how to act and doesn't look handsome, at all. Seriously, he looks ugly. There's one scene where his love interest is dying and instead of... well, you know... performing, he just says a bundle of words and in the next scene, his girlfriend (I think) is suddenly ALIVE! HOW? HOW DID SHE GET BETTER? WHAT HAPPENED? DIDN'T SHE GET STABBED IN HER LEFT SHOULDER?????? AHHH WHATEVER!!!\r It's one problem that this movie has: The pacing. Holy sh*t, the pacing is f*cking horrendous. We jump from one scene to another without substance, feeling more like a marathon than a movie. The plot is convoluted at times, in fact, so convoluted that occasionally you don't know what the characters are talking about. Seriously, along with the bad pacing, we still have banal conversations between underdeveloped characters that are portrayed by untalented people, resulting in a dull movie that is 1 and a half hours (hey, at least, it's not as long as Transformers 4!).\r The action and the effects are reprehensibly bad. One thing I notice in the action sequences is that the director decided to put slow-motion in every single one of them, and I ask: What was the point? Why do you need to put slow-motion in your fight scenes? Hmm? For 3D? But, I'm watching this movie in my house, and I don't have 3D, so the fights don't come as exciting (because they are not). They come as moronic. Hey, I'm not gonna lie, I laughed at some parts. When the movie is not relying on unnecessary slow-motion, they resort to misguidedly choreographed battles. They are barely enthusiastic, if you ask me. It's a pity, because with all the swords, shields and equipment this movie had, it could've been a lot better. Like, A LOT.\r The cast looks bored. Kellan Lutz makes a terrible Hercules. I bet that Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson will make a better Hercules than him, and I haven't seen that movie yet! Luckily, for Lutz, he can't be blamed for torpedoing the project, as everything in this film is sub-par and so bland. The actress who plays the love interest of Lutz's character is just a bad actress. Hey, you girl, hear me out: Your bad performance in this hellish film was noticed by me! I saw how your character died, AND THAT WASN'T EVEN BELIEVABLE IN THE SLIGHTEST! URGH!\r Final Score to The Legend of Hercules: 0/10. Overall, avoid this clusterf*ck of a movie boasting a lackluster plot, generic characters, horrible pacing, uninspiring acting and laughably unexciting battle scenes. GOD, THIS MOVIE IS WORSE THAN TRANSFORMERS AGE OF EXTINCTION AND THAT'S SAYING SOMETHING BECAUSE THAT MOVIE WAS A FLAMING PILE OF SH*T. PLEASE, EVERYONE INVOLVED IN THIS STUPID MOVIE, GROW SOME F*CKING BRAIN CELLS!!\r Uff, Christ..."

He's built like a Greek god. Both strong points. Acting, however, is his Achilles heel, which falls under the Situational irony category.\r Verdict: Watch Ben Hur. Watch 300. Skip this."

It wasn\u2019t even doing a Hercules movie at all! Hercules wasn\u2019t in the movie at all! The characters are weak, the script is **** and it becomes a Gladiator/300 ripoff. Twilight boy ruined the greek story in which I have come to love for years now, f*ck you."
