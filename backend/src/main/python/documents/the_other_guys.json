Although some of the jokes don't always work and I didn't find the reoccurring joke that Will Ferrell's character is irresistible very funny, by the end I felt thoroughly entertained. Another great addition to the Will Ferrell comedy collection."

Then the reviews started sneaking out, and they were trending surprisingly positive. Not just \"this is okay for a summer yukfest\" positive but \"this is one of Will Ferrell's best movies ever!\" positive. On opening night, it was certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, with a score in the low 80s. Second only to Elf (2003). That's a better score than Talladega Nights (2006), Stranger than Fiction (2006), Wedding Crashers (2005), Anchorman (2004) and Old School (2003). Take a look at that list again. \"Wow,\" you might be thinking, as I did the other night. \"I must have got it all wrong. This movie must be pretty awesome!\" Nope. Nope it isn't. I mean yeah, it's alright. But I'd say it's worse than every one of the Ferrell flicks listed above, save Talladega Nights, which is equally hit or miss.

There were some funny parts but much of the funny stuff was just kind of stupid and only mildly funny . Most of the funny jokes were way over played and repeated several times throughout the film, they were funny once but after two, three, or more times they were a snooze. The characters were somehat odd, Michael Keaton played a soft spoken chief and just was not funny, Mark W's character was even more odd at time. I would definitely wait for the dvd"

      "text": "The Other Guys tells the story of Officers Terry Hoitz (Mark Whalberg) and Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) who aren't the hero cops that the police department idolize, they're merely the Other Guys. The main guys, Danson (The Rock/Dwayne Johnson) and Highsmith (SAMUEL L JACKSON!) set the film alight with their testosterone fuelled opening sequence of brilliance, complete with brilliant lines such as \"Did somebody call 91-Holy **** and \"You have the right to remain silent, but I wanna hear you scream!\". Using a bus to slingshot a car into druggie bad guys and into a store, causing an explosion, now THATS an opening sequence. Martin and Fosse are the rivals of Hoitz and Gamble, leading to a silent fight at a wake with characters whispering insults and momentarily stopping to pay condolences. They also get some killer dialogue, whether its cornering a villian (\"I hope you like the taste of prison food...and penis\") or talking about their weekend. \"So then what happened?\" \"What do you think happened? I woke up, I took the belt off my neck, got in my car, and got out of there.\" \"Talk about a wild weekend\" \"I thought I was going to have to shoot my way out, hahahaha ...what are you going to do though, you know ...bar mitzvah's\" They have an especially funny scene in a classroom of 10 year olds, which is probably my favourite scene in the film, and their retorts about the coke-covered car were especially funny. Of course, the two main characters get their share of funny dialogue also, whether its Will Ferrells quote about how a tuna would beat a lion in a fight or groaning about how walking away from explosions are BS. Its not just the quotes which are funny about them, as Gamble is revealed to have shot Derek Jeter in a flashback (\"He's a bi-racial angel\") and Terry gets his gun taken away and given a wooden gun, only to have the wooden gun taken and given a rape whistle. All of the actors play their roles well, (after Planet of the Apes and The Happening, you'll be surprised Mark Whalberg plays a role well) and Steve Coogan definatley does well as the troubled business man. Even the one scene characters like Christinith and her hairy (or not) husband do well when they are showed, even if they provide nothing to the plot but comedic foil. As you can see, I loved a lot about this film. But not everything worked. Bits that didn't work for me? The relationship between Terry and his wife (Eva Mendez) wasn't really funny, it was essentially him saying his hot wife was plain and treated her unspectacularly. Granted, I liked their last scene where he made amends with her and admitted he couldn't believe she was with him, and sending the granny out to relay their dirty messages had me laughing, but the bits before didn't make me laugh. Making Terry a pimp back in college seems to be an idea which is great when you say it out loud, but when executed you seem a little dissapointed. Also, Will Ferrell didn't even convince as a college guy, he just looked like a 40 something man retaking college, but thats a minor niggle. Also, the scene where Allen is jealous over his wife taking ballet with another guy (I assume that was her instructor). Will Ferrell livened up that scene, and Allens good ballet dancing was a laughable surprise, but the rest of the scene just didn't work for me. All in all, this film isn't as good as Anchorman, but it certainly beats the dire Cop-Out. Definately a brilliant action comedy"

      "text": "WOW! This movie is laugh out loud funny throughout.  I have seen comedies go dull after the opening 20 minutes but not this one.  First off, the funniest character in this movie is the one you wouldn't expect. Mark Wahlberg creates a new image for himself with \"The Other Guys.\"  We have all seen his movies and without a doubt, he has the acting skill, but who knew he was so funny!  He will have more comedy roles due to this one, and I am looking forward to seeing them.  The story behind \"The Other Guys\" is kind of dark.  How big-time business men rob hard-working americans of their lifetime services just to cover losses.  Wahlberg and Farrell are the cops behind-the-scenes who protect us from them, and they are just hilarious while they do so.  The Captain's TLC references had me laughing for days and have become punch-lines to almost any joke you can think of.  Priceless movie and an instant classic. 10/10"

From the unlikable characters to even the unlikable actors (who are usually much better) and a rather silly storyline that got confusing. It has some good laughs and that's where most of the rating will come from, but as a whole it's a fairly messy movie with overdone jokes and bad performances from both Will Ferrell & Mark Wahlberg. Overall it's OK but certainly not one worth rushing out to go and see."

Went to see this movie Sat 8/7/10 around 7pm and it was showing on 3 screens in a 20-screen complex. Next two showings of the movie were sold out so we (wife and 3 sons) skipped it but had high hopes given its popularity. Returned Sunday evening again at 7pm and the showing was half-full; important because great comedies are even better when a big audience is howling. While the movie was ok, it never had that bust-a-gut scene that Ferrell is capable of. That said, Ferrell was much better than Wahlberg, who's character range was close to zero. You can wait for DVD on this one."

There were not enough funny lines in this film by either Ferrell or Wahlberg, and I found my self waiting for the funny stuff in between the movie itself.  It felt like there was a sub-par story that took way too long to tell, and inside the telling of this story I waited impatiently for the next bout of comic relief (which happened way to infrequently).  My expectations of Ferrell are set based on the antics in Talladega Nights, Anchorman, and Step Brothers, but at no point within this movie was Ferrell able to take over and put his hilarious signature on it.  Eva Longorio was the best part of this movie, while the \"hot girls love Ferrell's character\" joke was just not that funny after the Eva Longorio dinner scene.  I don't recommend this film, nor will I likely watch it again on DVD.Waiting for Anchorman 2 instead."

The jokes are funny more often than not, and the action is at least decent, if somewhat muddled due to the fast-paced ADD editing that makes many modern action movies almost indecipherable.  Ferrell and Wahlberg do a good job in the lead roles, although it seemed that most of the entertaining lines actually went to Wahlberg, who might want to stick to comedy after the somewhat dull response that's greeted his recent dramatic work.  Overall, a huge step up from recent Ferrell comedies like Semi-Pro, but doesn't break any boundaries and is destined to be remembered as simply \"entertaining\" and nothing more."

It may not always make sense, but it's always hilarious.Also much more comedy dense than recent movies, there aren't that many 'slow' parts, and the ones that were there didn't last long. Definitely held interest the entire running time.-1pt for an incomplete plot. The Wahlberg character just isn't given much of a back story outside of a single high-profile screwup, and too much of the main villain's plot happens offscreen."

Will Ferrell makes a great comeback after a few bad roles and production choices (The Goods, Land of the Lost). Mark Wahlberg finds new life as a comedic actor and the summer of surprise funny men continues as Michael Keaton gives a solid supporting performance. My two complaints would be that 1) The 1st half was funnier than the 2nd 2) This movie could've done with some more editing, clocking in just at 2 hours in length Overall though, hilarious from start to finish, if Cop Out left a bad taste in your mouth for buddy cop comedies, The Other Guys will surely help you rinse that right out."
