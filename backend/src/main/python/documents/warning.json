      "text": "(Mauro Lanari)Feature film debut of a Polish production that, following its own tradition, catechizes us on the presumed consequences of atheism and sins. A chaotic, religiously fundamentalist and heretical \"Se7en\" (Fincher 1995) since, against the magisterial doctrine, it shows the Apocalypse as punishment and not as salvation."

      "rating": "7",
      "text": "The main idea of the film Warning is great and very current. It's just a shame that it is based on physical reality that violates many physical laws. For someone who studied well at school, the film can be considered quite naive."
