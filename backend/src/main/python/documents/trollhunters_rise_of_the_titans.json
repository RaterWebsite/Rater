The plot was decent however the action/fight scenes are, in my opinion, the best part of the movie. My main issue with the movie was the ending.

Esse final \u00e9 horroroso PRIMEIRO: ele destroi toda saga com o desenvolvimento do jim jogaram no lixo ele n\u00e3o sendo mais ca\u00e7adores de trolls. SEGUNDO: ele tirar o jim como ca\u00e7ador e passa para o bob que n\u00e3o sabe com \u00e9 ser um ele, ele \u00e9 para ser um bra\u00e7o direito do jim e n\u00e3o o sendo o principal.
