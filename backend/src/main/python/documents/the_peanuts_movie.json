The story and animation was great and they touched on almost everything that makes charlie brown so great!! Im 51 years old and a huge charlie brown fan, and I took my nephew who is 9 years old and he loved it as well. He laughed all the ways through it and when i asked him to grade it he gave it a 10 out of 10< as and adult i would give it a 9 out of ten. The only thing i didn't like was that they used the wrong voice actor for peppermint patties voice, every other characters voice was perfect."

At age 54 I still love the strip for its groundbreaking work, with kids facing adult problems, antics, and artwork that would influence every strip that contained kids.    \"Calvin\" from \"Calvin and Hobbes\" would be impossible without Shulz' being there with his own imagination first, like Snoopy's never ending battle with the Red Baron or other imagined characters like the great \"Joe Cool\", various star athletes or a great novelist.\rSo the movie was one that would be a tough call - make it wilder and decidedly different from the \"Peanuts\" we grew up with, or pay slavishly close attention to the original strip, with some of the classic jokes and keeping that original feel and magic.    Wisely this movie is true Peanuts all the way, the most startling evolution, if you can call it that is the more dimensional characters, a big change from the flat cartoon style previous Peanuts TV and movie productions were.\rWhile this movie won't replace \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\" as the classic and best Christmas special ever, in my opinion, it is a delight for us lifelong blockheads, and we get to see the little red haired girl for the first time!\rSnoopy and Woodstock provide the yucks as this pair work on that \"famous\" novel \"It Was A Dark and Stormy Night\", and Snoopy finds himself rescuing his love Fifi from that despicable Red Baron.\rBut it's Charlie Brown who steals the show, and the movie does focus on what makes Charlie Brown so likable in the first place - a heart of gold, and despite his never ending failures, a spirit that refuses to give up.    It's a good life lesson for all of us, to be the best, most honest people we can be, and never let the world beat us down.    I for one appreciate the conclusion which I won't spoil here, and recommend this movie for all \"Peanuts\" fans, young and old.    The director didn't mess with a winning formula, and Charlie Brown fans worldwide rejoice."

I finally got to see the film this Thanksgiving and I would like to start by saying I was totally satisfied and left with a big smile off my face as I left the theater. I know it's really hard to say this,but in the whole theater, there were only two children in a rated G movie!!! It was a great film and has a great moral with it to. It teaches children a lesson of how to be good and get a girl to like you. I would say the first 15-30 minutes are pretty slow, while introducing the characters; but then it got more fun and fun, until I started laughing. The animation is flawless, and pretty much the only flaw I have with the film is when they kept on cutting back to Snoopy's typewriter dream thing. (84.5/100)"

The 3D animation is absolutely on par with any Pixar film, while still maintaining the 'Peanuts' classic visual look. It's amazing to see how well the humor has been adapted for modern children and adults. The older crowd gets their nostalgia, the children get introduced to a classic cartoon in a fresh way, and all the while just being able to sit and enjoy a pleasant story that will leave everyone grinning. It's a warm, heart-felt, simple and humorous movie and gives us a refreshing breath of air from all the remakes, sequels, and superhero films we've been drowning in for the past few years. It's a great family movie, as a 'Peanuts' film should be, and it could give 'Inside Out' a run for the Oscar."

Everything about it was spot-on from the animation and the voices to the humor and tone. If you're like me and grew up watching Charlie Brown specials, then the feel of this movie will be immediately familiar, yet still seems modern. And the writers (Charles Schulz own children) somehow found a way to include every single Peanuts reference you could ask for without making it feel shoehorned in or patronizing.\r No matter how old you are, you'll enjoy this movie. I guess if you just hate life in general, then you may not like this movie. Or if you require large explosions and shakey-cams to enjoy your theater experience then I suppose this movie could seem dull. But if you're up for a funny, charming, warm, positive film, you can't go wrong with this one. And I know that children enjoy it too because the little girl leaving the theater next to me wouldn't stop talking about it. I challenge you to see this movie and not leave smiling."

I know that Peanuts has been around for decades and I'm still relatively young (I'm only 19), but I'm still one of millions who grew up reading the Peanuts comic strips in the paper as well as watching the many cartoons they made for them. So needless to say, I was really looking forward to to seeing this so I could sit back and not just enjoy this film, but also reflect back on how much I loved growing up with Charlie Brown and the many other characters, and that's exactly what this film did for me! I loved every second of it and it was everything I wanted it to be! Charming, adorable, and most importantly, very nostalgic! It was also surprisingly funny in almost every moment, much more so than I originally thought it would be! The animation was lively and vivid as well! So overall, it's easily one of the best animated films I've seen all year and one of the funnest films I've seen all year in general! Even if you didn't grow up with Peanuts, it's still an absolutely charming and fun film, but for any and all Peanuts fans and those who grew up with it, this is an absolute must-see! You won't be disappointed!"

Hollywood did this one right: they kept the message clean and pure, just as Charles Schultz would have liked it.\r I suspect parents who grew up with the Peanuts will enjoy this more than their kids. This is a classic, simple love story and underdog tale.

      "text": "Written by the younger generation of Schulz, the classic animation sticks nearly to its original source materials and remains traditional style of telling a simple yet unambitious story that is friendly for kids. Diverting from the main genre usually seen in Disney's style, Blue Sky Studio approaches by representing the entire story in a group of kiddos without any significant adults characters and relationship between the parents and children. The story is mainly separated into two parts - the first part on the main protagonist, Charlie Brown is very educable and absolutely suitable for the maturer young audiences while the fantasy part of Snoopy that is full of actions and adventure would definitely serve as great enjoyment for the kids. The combination of colorful CGIs and the unique visual effects are spectacular, charming, adorable and it looks as an upgrade from the comic version. Overall, this remake is definitely a delightful, sweet, warmhearted and nostalgic family fare that stresses on the importance of looking and cherishing at the positive values that each person owns."

Don't get me wrong Pixar makes great movies there is no doubt about that but there is a definite pattern of movies that aren't made by Pixar getting reamed in reviews around awards seasons. Almost to the extent where you can't help but wonder if some strings are being pulled behind the scenes. Is this movie better then Inside Out? No it isn't. However it is one of the better animated films I have seen in awhile.\r Most of the critic complaints I see talk about the movie being too tame. This is just sad. This is more then film this is art. This movie was so well put together and so many critics are not so much crapping on it as they are saying \"it was nice for a few minutes and then it got old.\r I want to make something very clear here. I am not usually a fan of tame movies. There are critics giving this a positive review BECAUSE it plays it safe and is family friendly to the tamest extent. Then there are critics who crap on it because it plays it safe and doesn't have too many risque jokes for adults like so many kids films usually sneak in. I have never been a politically correct person. I have never cared what a movie does or does not contain all I care is that the film is good. This movie is great. Yes it is family friendly and quite tame compared to most G and PG films nowadays. Why is that suddenly a bad thing?\r I love to play Grand Theft Auto and Assassin's Creed just like any other hardcore gamer. Does that really mean absolutely everything we watch and interact with in life has to be depressing? This movie had me leaving the theater genuinely feeling good. It had some nice positive messages. Why is that a bad thing? I don't consider myself a religious person by any means hell if anything I am anti religion, This movie taught good values though. Why crap on a movie simply because it was too safe?\r As a critic when you review a film you are supposed to review it off of the merit of the film not your own closeminded views.I will say it over and over again. This film was so well put together and executed. I genuinely don't understand where my fellow critic's are coming from.\r Now I don't know about you but when I see someone write a review this long I generally check their profile to see if they are just diehard fans of a series or hate something for no reason. You all know the accounts I mean the throwaways giving zeros to hated films and 10s to films we know aren't as good as they are saying they are but they can't help but give the series perfect scores. So I checked my own profile and unfortunately found that for some reason only 2 of my previous reviews show. I don't know if it was a Facebook linking issue or what but 50 something reviews I have written for this site since the site was first online are just gone. I remember writing those two reviews on my cellphone so maybe it synced to a new account or something. So I have no proof of my credibility to offer because apparently it has disappeared into the void.\r From the first 10 seconds of the film all the way through to the end this film is true to Peanuts. Everyone who complains about how safe it is? This is an accurate recreation of a comic strip that has been in the public consciousness since the 1950's. A time when frankly far less was considered corrrect or allowed in entertainment. They could have updated and revamped Peanuts changing it entirely throwing in Spongebob type jokes everywhere. If they had done so though would we really be watching Peanuts? Personally I applaud the film creators for staying true to source material OVER SIXTY years old. That takes some serious cajones. I find it a very sad state of affairs that unless a movie has content A,B,C, or doesn't contain content E.\r As mentioned in the beginning I am not religious at all quite the opposite. There is a 2 second moment in the film where Charlie Brown makes a somewhat religious yet ambiguous comment. I guess hardcore atheist reviewers who feel like a 2 second inspirational message in a 90 minute long film is \"pushing the christianity agenda\" so therefore the film should get points docked. I used to be a professional reviewer I stopped I don't even remember why. I am so pissed off that these \"critics\" get paid to be so biased towards films over the tiniest things. It is very rare you read a film review that doesn't get a good third of its overall score docked because one instant in a film doesn't agree wtih them. There is no realistic scoring method they use. They just throw their comments in and make up a plausible number at the end. Oh wait that is why I left I remember now. Was sick of people dictating to me what I could or could not rate scores because of studio influence.\r This is a great movie. Yes it \"plays it safe\" The source material is SIXTY years old. If it didn't stay true to the original it wouldn't be Peanuts it would be something else. Watch it then judge for yourself."

The reviews that say don't support this movie because it teaches kids to be okay being \"a loser\" is entirely wrong and borderline stupid. It's about TRYING and sometimes things don't go your way. Obviously Charlie Brown knew how to fly a kite, and it just doesn't work out for him. He never gave up though and he was even able to teach someone else through his experience. I thought the movie was absolutely perfect and Schulz would have been proud. I mean sure, he wanted \"flat\", but this movie did it justice.

What Martino does is direct some incredible shots through animation seen most prominently in the various flights and battles of Snoopy's imagination and encounters with the Red Baron. The film is basically an equal balance between an adorable throwback story that brings Charlie Brown and all his insecurities pouring into the screen and an entertaining gag following the imagination of Snoopy. This scheme proves to work perfectly, balancing both heartwarming charm and entertaining humor. It's definitely one for the children and will sure to please the likes of them all, but it's an entertaining film for the parents in the room as well.

After 'Tintin', 'Doraemon', 'Asterix', 'Mr Peabody' 'Winnie' and a few others, now this movie joined the club. I'm waiting for many more like 'Garfield', 'Kim Possible', 'Calvin & Hobbes' et cetera to make its way.\r 'Peanuts' characters considered one of the beautiful cartoon characters, just like 'Calvin & Hobbes'. They're simple drawings, yet very cute and delightful. These are mostly best suited to render in 2D animation, so till I watch them in 3D I always had a curiosity and doubts. This film is still a mix of both styles  - like eyes, mouth, dusts and in the side view, it was 2D drawing, but overall characters and backgrounds are 3D.\r It was so good movie, for the 90 minutes I became a child again. As usual, there were two tales, one was Snoopy's fictional account and the others' Charlie Brown's crush on a little red-haired girl. Both of them were great, but I liked Charlie's a lot.\r Once the animation was considered only for the kids, but now the world sees it differently. This film had an excellent box office. So definitely there will be a sequel. My only upset is it failed to do good at Annie awards, but anyway, like Disney studio says, that award ceremony is a joke and a disgrace to animation and animation (movie) fans.\r 8\u00bd/10"

The animation and CGI are well done by the folks at Blue Sky Studios. They managed to balance the vintage charm of the Peanuts characters with the tools of modern animation. It was also nice to see little bits of penciled animation juxtaposed against the more modern CG look. The story is simple and enjoyable. It did something a lot of films don't do often. It put a smile on my face. When I walked out of the theater I couldn't help but feel like I had a bit of extra spring in my step. I think everyone has a bit of Charlie Brown in them."

They even attempted to match the voices of the original 1960s peanuts characters all though the hair color is a bit suspect.  But if your're one of the many millennials or gen Xer critics that gave this a bad review because you never read a Peanuts comic or seen a Peanuts cartoon and can't understand the nostalgia older people have for it, you would be better off spending your money on some Anime cartoon or Xbox game."

An absolutely gorgeous treat for the eyes. Of course, while appreciated, a high-quality level of animation isn't enough to carry a film. A pretty exterior would have meant nothing were the insides of the film just as pleasant.\r Thankfully \"The Peanuts Movie\" is filled with heart, humor, and charm. There's a nice lesson about how failure doesn't define you. That even in the face of mistakes you can still be a winner by staying true to who you are and being a good person. That's a message that's just good for adults to hear as it is for the children that will be watching this movie with them.\r It's a great flick for the entire family. The jokes do perhaps lean a little too much on physical humor. People fall, slam into things, and get hit by objects for the majority of the film. However there are smarter bits of verbal humor that will appeal to a larger audience. That being said, it's physical bits are still regularly funny, if a bit exhausting.\r The Peanuts Movie is a genuinely great movie. One with heartwarming moments to go along with it's barrel of laughs. For older audiences it's going to feel welcomingly familiar. For those who have never experienced the world of Snoopy and Charlie Brown, well it's one heck of a great way to get introduced."

I will say the animation was well done and creative.\r I grew up reading Peanuts in the newspaper and in book form.  I watched all the specials growing up.  At first the movie seemed cute, as I remembered all the old comic strips.  After about 15 minutes the novelty wore off, and I was getting a little bored with the movie.  I got to the point of checking off all the things I remembered of Peanuts when I was a kid, then that got boring.  By the end of the movie I felt like I spent a hour and a half reading old Peanuts comic strips I had read over and over again, when I was 10. I have no interest in rereading old Peanuts comic strips.  I could not wait for the movie to end.\r My daughters reaction was tepid at best.  I don't think I heard them laugh once, and they struggled to find something positive to say about the movie after we left.\r For parents of children under 9 years old, seems like a safe movie the kids will enjoy.  If I had to spend much more time in the theatre watching this, I might have started banging my head against a wall."

And like most Peanuts shows you've seen, you'll quickly bore with the '60s characters, various family members fell asleep throughout. And some of that falls on the animation, too, which was fine but certainly not made for renown. IOW, it's not a Pixar presentation."

It has little narrative structure and instead comes across as a splash of ideas, old and new, that haven't been formed properly. It has no right being a movie - maybe if this was a series of shorts on a kids TV channel, it would have worked better, but it certainly doesn't fit the movie format.\r It gets points for masterfully bringing the animation up to modern day levels, but visuals and a slapdash attempt to hook nostalgia alone does not a good movie make."
