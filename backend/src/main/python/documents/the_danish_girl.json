The Danish Girl contains gripping screenplay, mild natured palpable environment supported by majestic performances and emotions pouring out on the screen. Tom Hooper's vision and the on paper script comes alive in each and every stills of the movie and he deserves all the credit for it. Eddie Redmayne is soothing on screen and offers the most innocent performance whilst performing the boldest scenes proving once again why he is one of the finest talents at the current time and with a perfect supporting cast like Alicia Vikander helping the audience sail smoothly to the shore. The Danish Girl represents sexual phases innocently with brittle forces emerging from each characters allowing the audience live among them resulting into one of the finest art that cinema ever introduced."

      "text": "Tom Hooper seems to be the period piece go-to director for by-the-numbers Oscar films. After the immense success of the little indie that could The King\u2019s Speech gaining massive momentum at TIFF in 2010, going on to win the coveted Best Picture Oscar; then the grand and highly ambitious Les Miserables, Hooper seemed to have crafted a career out of production rich designs, strong performances and historically relevant social issues in his films. With the addition of Eddie Redmayne, fresh off his Oscar winning role in last year\u2019s The Theory of Everything, Hooper\u2019s newest The Danish Girl was expected to come out a clear winner. Sadly, The Danish Girl is a confused, highly theatrical and poorly constructed transparent film with laughable dialogue between its two leads Redmayne and rising star Alicia Vikander.\r The Danish Girl seemed to be a foolproof, sure-fire bet for success; Redmayne was coming off his Oscar win as Stephen Hawkings; the first look photo of the film of Redmayne in drag gained immense buzz online; Hooper finally got a project off the ground after many years of being shelved by studios and various directors; its female lead Alicia Vikander had four major roles in 2015 with nothing but great buzz, and finally, the cast rounded out with the grandly talented Matthias Schoenaerts. Yet, Hooper\u2019s The Danish Girl came across as a forced, highly contrived Oscar wannabe film with pretentious camera tricks, dizzying angles and weak vehicle for any kind of lead up to have Redmayne the first actor to win two back-to-back lead actor Oscars.\r Set in 1926, in what could be described as Hooper\u2019s historically hipster-era in Copenhagen, the film follows Gerda Wegener (Vikander) and Einar Wegener (Redmayne), a very passionate, close-knit painting couple who cherish the high art culture of Copenhagen, including its posh parties, galas and presentations. Along for the ride, is their close friend and confident floozy Oola Paulson (Amber Heard), who motivates the couple to partake in the lavish cultural niche of the country, without much else.\r In a desperate attempt to finish up a recent portrait for her upcoming, impending gallery showcase, Gerda asks her loving and supportive husband Einar, to place the painted dress on, along with some nylons and heals. As Einar caresses and is seduced by the fabrics of the garment, he becomes transfixed, mind, body and soul, with the crazy idea of becoming a woman. As Oola enters the couples apartment, in preparation for another trendy evening gather, jokingly names Einar\u2019s female counterpart Lili. Unbeknownst to them at the time, the origins of Lili would just be the start of Gerda\u2019s and Einar\u2019s life.\r Transgenderism is a huge and highly talked about social issue in many art forms today, especially within the visual medium. With shows like \u201cTransparent\u201d, \u201cOrange is the New Black\u201d and others making waves, it\u2019s no surprise that Hollywood busted out an origin film of one of the first successful transgender stories and operations recorded. Sadly, The Danish Girl, while trying to be trendsetting and a wavelengths type film for the truly difficult realities for many, serves as a laughable and pretentious story of over-dramatic film aesthetics and acting.\r Scorn with painful editing, inauspicious mood-setting scoring and less than hubris camera angles and filing styles, it seems as though Hooper forgot to focus on his characters and their difficult and revolutionary small details. For example, when Gerda tries to persuade Einar to coming to a party with her, which he declines vivacious, she convinces him to come as Lili, for fun and merely as a joke. While Einar\u2019s transformation and changing montage is brief, unlike those cliched high school prom films that has the big transformation of its lead female protagonist as she goes from ugly duckling to beautiful swan, Lili has no big reveal; merely a quick shot of her walking the streets, rushing to the party with Gerda. Hooper takes for granted so much of the importance of Einar to Lili, and focuses on a very muddled and hard to define relationship between a man and a woman; lovers to friends; wife to cousin?\r Danish pastries are famous for being laminated, multilayered and delicate. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for The Danish Girl. Burnt to a crisp with overacting and some poor make-up and costume choices, the film does offer some saving graces thanks mostly to an astonishing performance by Alicia Vikander and Matthias Schoenaerts, and a very special and one of the rare believable scenes of Redmayne through a looking glass. Vikander, who counterbalances Redmayne\u2019s manic behaviour and inability to vocalize how he feels he is meant to be a woman, Vikander\u2019s gentle touch to Gerda\u2019s character brings true emotions of how any partner and loved one would deal with a very radical decision today, and more so in 1926 Europe."

      "text": "Eddie Redmayne is in another extraordinary film where he goes deeper than we ever seen him in, he shines along with his co-star Alicia Vikander (Ex Machina). This film has a strong message about loving yourself and how love isn't defined by sexual orientation, gender, it's about the soul and the film explains that all well. The film is set in Copenhagen in the mid 1920's, portrait painter Gerda Wegener (Alicia Vikander) asks her husband Einar Wegener (Eddie Redmayne) who is also a painter, but he's a landscape painter who poses in for Gerda's painting as a favor for Gerda while she's waiting for her model to arrive. He dons silk stockings and matching pumps, and he's embarrassed by it, then it slowly returns to a confusing confrontation with his feelings he repressed since childhood. Dressing for a masquerade ball, the delicate placing of his hands and crossing of his legs literally turns him on. Drawn to a double life as Einar and his shy but alluring \"cousin Lili\" he conceals dual personality that nearly drives him to suicide. Director Tom Hooper (The King's Speech) is a true visionary, he does a beautiful job with making Lucinda Coxin's screenplay into real life. Redmayne and Vikander are the best part of this film they make this movie better they helm the film and they play their characters really well. 5 out of 5 stars"

Perhaps that's just me, but by the ending I wasn't particularly emotionally involved\rVERDICT: 'The Danish Girl' proves Redmayne isn't planning on stopping being amazing any time soon - it could just have been a more emotionally engaging story overall."

Without being overtly political, the movie just gives audience a better understanding of what if feels like when somebody you truly loves is not able to be fully him/herself and ask the difficult question of what to do next. Gerda portrayed by Alicia Vikander (Ex Machina) has to come to term when Einar portrayed by Eddie Redmayne (Theory of Everything, Jupiter Ascending) realize that he is a woman, or as Lili. He undergoes multiple treatments to fix his chemical imbalance and impurity but it just convinces him more that it is not his body. What makes the film great and a standout of the year is the superb and amazing performance by Alicia and Eddie. You feel vulnerable and powerless."

      "text": "Nice try Eddie Redmayne and Tom Hooper. I know for a fact that the two of you wanted a second Oscar so badly, so you made this movie, but this isn't fooling anyone.\r The Danish Girl is about a Danish artist, depicted her husband, Einer, as a female in one of her paintings. As the painting gains attention, Einer begins to transform as well - becoming more and more feminine until Einer becomes Lili Elbe - and becomes the first person to receive a male-to-female sex reassignment surgery. While Gerda is supportive, she comes to realize this change will prove a challenging ordeal to their relationship - even more so when Hans Axgil, an art dealer and old friend of Einer, comes into her life.\r Oscar bait movies like this really makes my skin crawl, because this movie literally ticks off ways of getting that Oscar and it's quite shocking how noticeable it is here. I really liked The King's Speech, I mean it's not for everyone but I thought it was a great movie and I couldn't wait to watch Tom Hooper's next film. Oh Hooper, what happened? I didn't care for Les Mis\u00e9rables and I sure didn't care for this movie. The Danish Girl sadly fails to deliver and everything feels so force. The emotions, the art and the story itself falls completely flat.\r What the hell happened to Tom Hooper? after he won that Oscar he really lost his touch. There's hidden greatness in this movie and Hooper could have easily taken a different path to make this movie great, but he doesn't do that here, but he intend plays it safe and makes everything feel so force with emotions that there's no emotional attachment. There were some well directed scenes in the movie and it is well shot, but I felt like the movie was missing something and that's me actually caring about whats going on. The movie itself wants me to care about whats going on with the characters, but the only one I really cared about or felt bad about is Alicia Vikander character. I miss the old Tom Hooper.\r Now I've got nothing against Eddie Redmayne as I think he's a talented guy, but he seriously needs to pick better roles in the future. He was absolutely awful in Jupiter Ascending and he sure wasn't good here. He's performance in this movie is what I call \"pretentious\" and \"by the books Oscar bait\". The emotions were there but I just didn't feel it and how the execution could have been better. A role like this is not a easy challenge and this must have been tough for Eddie, I mean in recent interviews, he has said that the role has personally changed his way of seeing things with genders and transgender people. He took a risk but it sadly didn't come together as promised. I swear, if Eddie Redmayne gets a second Oscar for this movie, I will be pissed.\r Alicia Vikander was hands down the stand out of this movie. As I said before, I cared for her more than Redmayne character and that's saying a lot. Shes been not-stop impressing me this year and I can't wait to see more of her in future movies. She was brilliant in this movie as I really felt her struggle and her dealing to whats going on in her life is truly heartbreaking. She was without a doubt the best part of this movie and she did an magnificent performance.\r The cinematography was good, the style of the movie was neat, the score was pretty solid and that's really it.\r Overall The Danish Girl isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. This movies purpose of existing is just to win awards and nothing else."

Redmayne is perfect for the role, not only because he makes such a beautiful woman (more so than the real thing: see below), but because he\u2019s such a gifted and brilliantly expressive actor. His delicate nuanced portrayal is exceptionally touching. But this story is about both of them and Vikander also turns in a moving performance. The locations are lovely and the dresses gorgeous, but every plot development takes too long to unfold.

Recently, because of Caitlayn Jenner and recent shows based around transgender people, the public is becoming more aware of the subject. In 1999 Hilary Swank won a Best Actress award for her role in \"Boy Don't Cry\" as a girl who transgendered to a man and  in 2005 Felicity Huffman was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar in \"TransAmerica\" as a man transgendering to a woman.\r Einar Wegener, played by Eddie Redmayne, was one of the first men to transition to a woman, in this case, Lili Elbe, in this based on a true story written about in \"Man Into Woman\" in 1933. Einar is helped, understood and cared for by his wife Gerder, played by Alicia Vikander. In more ways than one she aids Einer become Lili not really understanding what he is going through just as he really doesn't and the doctors he goes to don't.\r Both were well known Danish painters with Einar famous for landscapes while Gerder would become more famous for her paintings of 'Lili'. As a young couple they were very much in love with an active sex life but the more Einar became Lili their relationship in all ways changed.\r Having been married for over 20 years the relationships between Einar, Lili with Gerder and hers with both is sort of given short shift in understanding what happens in cases like this.\r As Redmayne proved last year in his role as Stephen Hawking and as Marius in \"Les Miserables\", winning an Oscar for the former, he can completely immerse himself in a role but here he seems to be all poses and uses scarves as a co-star.\r Alicia Vikander appeared in 6 films this year particularly recieving a lot of attention as artificial intelligence Ava in \"Ex Machina\". Her role here seems underwritten and she is sort of given short shift regarding the feelings she is suppose to be undergoing.\r Amber Heard as a friend of Einer and Gerder and who gives Lili her name, Sebastion Koch as the pioneering doctor, Ben Henrik as Lili's first suitor and Matthias Schoenaerts as a boyhood friend and the first crush of Einar are all good supporting performers though the latter is put in the position of a possible lover for Gerder which doesn't ring true.\r \"The Danish Girl\" is an interesting film but doesn't deliver. There is also the problem of some important--at least they may be important--lines are very soft spoken to the point many people in the audience ask, \"What did they say?\", and it isn't the fault of the theatre's sound."

Director Tom Hooper manages to effectively apply what is fast becoming his formula of stylish and emotional period-drama treatment which takes advantage of solid performances, impeccable production design and an evocative Alexandre Desplat musical score.\r While \u2018The Danish Girl\u2019 is certainly not the first film to deal with issues of transgenderism, it\u2019s quite original in framing it as an issue of personality and gender identity rather than sexuality.\r While transgender people will view themselves as having been born in the wrong body, society may view it as a mental disorder (gender dysphoria), the point of a film like this is to build a bridge of acceptance between the way people view an issue that\u2019s now part of the media landscape\u2026 and battle against judgment from both sides by having unsuppressed open discussion.\r \u2018The Danish Girl\u2019 is essentially a human story set in a time long ago, yet not that different from today, but it\u2019s told with a narrative naivety which takes plenty of dramatic license and employs a bit too much artistic flair.\r Unsurprisingly when condensing a lifetime into two hours, the story deviates heavily from reality, but \u2018The Danish Girl\u2019 is ultimately let down by slick Hollywood sentimentality, despite being a European production, and the sanitizing of a far more painful and tragic story.\r The timing of the film may have been a fortunate coincidence, but the careful sculpting of a narrative that provides just a bit of shock but not enough to alienate the masses, and which pleases awards voters, is not.\r The Bottom Line\u2026\rWhile benefiting from typically evocative sights and sounds which illuminate a historical and yet fascinatingly timely central theme, \u2018The Danish Girl\u2019 takes too much dramatic license while sanitizing a true story for public consumption, and only scratches the surface of a complex social issue."

Hooper seems to have come in for a lot of critical wrath since winning an Oscar for his least enjoyable film, \u2018The King\u2019s Speech\u2019, and both his subsequent movies \u2018Les Miserables\u2019, and now this seem to have as many detractors as fans. The former group leaves me head scratchingly perplexed at this negativity as both films are beautifully conceived and marvellously acted examples of what cinema is all about. \u2018The Danish Girl\u2019 is a fascinating and, despite its two hour length, a concisely told and emotionally complex true story about transgender pioneer Lili Erbe. The film is a gorgeous prestige production from the beautiful locations in Paris and Copenhagen, through its breath taking production and costume designs, right down to the top notch performances of the two leads. Fresh from his Oscar winning success last year in \u2018The Theory of Everything\u2019, Eddie Redmayne is again very good. However, it has to be said that he does somewhat over do the coyness of the emerging Lili and, even at this early stage in his career, certain mannerisms and gestures are becoming quite identifiable within his repertoire. It is also unfortunate for him that in both his Oscar winning role and now here he has been somewhat overshadowed by his leading ladies. Felicity Jones stole the show in \u2018Theory\u2019 and a revelatory Alicia Vikander almost single handedly rains on his parade here. She runs a gauntlet of emotions and is heartbreakingly compelling. She becomes the film\u2019s focal point and its soul without unbalancing the drama. Hooper\u2019s direction is assured and there is a brevity in the editing to keep the pace interesting without seeming to trivialise or rush the complex and important story being told. If all this isn\u2019t enough to make you squeeze out the odd tear then Alexander Desplat\u2019s beautiful score will complete the task."

Despite this however, I must admit that his performance in this is much more emotionally driven and moving than his performance in The Theory of Everything was. In fact, if I had any say, I'd have had Michael Keaton (who deserved the Oscar for Birdman MUCH more than Redmayne did last year) win for last year instead of Redmayne and then have Redmayne win for this film instead. Alicia Vikander gives an equally worthy and heartbreaking performance. Overall, the film is made up to look pretty and appealing (mainly to attract Oscars of course), but honestly I found it not quite up to the same level that director Tom Hooper's previous films have been. I also found it to be a bit more melodramatic and dragged out than I would've liked.

      "text": "The Danish Girl is certainly an interesting film, but I would not call it a perfect one. The story is very intriguing but the whole film is carried by the performances from the leading duo of Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander and both of these stars deserve the Oscar nominations that they have received for this year. I can't say that I am a true fan of Tom Hooper's films. I didn't enjoy The Theory of Everything as much as some other people did although I did think it was a good film. I find that this film has a bit of a similar formula to The Theory of Everything (which of course also had Redmayne in a starring role) and there are points where this is completely obvious. The actors do a good job at playing their roles but there still feels like there is just something missing. The film just feels a little less significant than it should. Despite its performances The Danish Girl will just have to settle for being a \"good\" movie not a great one."

Chessy dialogue, undeveloped characters, awful direction and especially a painful and forced performance by Eddie Redmayne who proves that his Oscar last year was a total robbery! Not even Vikander's tour de force could save this one from the ashes. Skip this one or simply wait until it comes on normal TV. It's soooooooooooooooooooo bad!"

Eddie Redmayne managed to touch my soul and come to understand fully any trans-gender out there. Although i'm not keen on the way Alicia handled Gerda i'm still blown away by her performance. From costumes to scenery everything is marvellous an the aesthetics are on point. Amazing movie."

REdyeme perfectly captures the struggle of someone torn between two identities at a time when transgender was a not a norm and there was no clear path. While the prevelance of such behavior makes this struggle nto as severe it is still a major and relevant part of our society. The content of this film and Redyeme\u2019s performance make shtis a film worth seeing."

      "text": "The Danish Girl touches a topic that has been arising for decades, but only for the past few years has reached public\u2019s acceptance. Maybe it was the perfect time for release a movie telling the story about transgender, getting people inside the mind of one, experiencing the very little things of life as the protagonist does and becoming part of the changing process. The problems of the film start when the audience only notices small conflicts in the protagonist, even though his mind was already set; he made a decision that cannot be taken overnight, and that struggling is missing, diminishing the credibility of the plot. Here is where Einar\u2019s wife becomes so important, because she represents the \u201ccommon thought\u201d and in her the struggle is strong enough to split up her life, making she debates between what she wants and what is best for her loved one; this brings back reality to our scenario. The performance of Vikander is awesome transmitting the thing said before, but Redmayne is again superb and really committed to his part. Honorable mention to cinematography and Alexandre Desplat\u2019s soundtrack."

Why twist the truth when the real events are so compelling and interesting?Lily didn't just up and die after her first surgery. She actually had 3 and died on the fourth due to an infection, which caused cardiac arrest. She had already long divorced her wife and was already intent on getting married to a man and was using this fourth surgery, a uterus trasplant, in an attempt to have children with him. See that proven history was a heck of a lot better than the ending the film had, Which made everything seem like it was all rainbows and sunshine when it wasn't."

      "text": "An important biopic, but not inspiring.\r Before this film hitting the screens, I remember many experts were expecting it doing well at the Oscars. Now it's got 4 Oscar nods, even though it is very sad the movie is a hit and miss. A slipped away opportunity, had a great storyline, but the outcome was decent. An important historical biopic, at least for a certain section of the audience. I respect that, but it did not impress me as I anticipated.\r From the Academy Award winning director for the movie 'The King's Speech', and the last year's winner for a lead role, Eddie Reddmayne together did not deliver the expected masterpiece. But Alicia Vikander was so good, another brilliant co-female-star display just like Felicity Jones from Eddie's previous movie 'The Theory of Everything'. If I were a jury I would definitely give the supporting actress award to her, that's the result I'm hoping for in the next Sunday.\r The actor did a hard work for the title role, in the many scenes he mastered it, but that's where I slightly disappointed. I felt his character was a little intense, maybe I'm not getting him because I'm straight. The locations, costumes, even the direction and music were good. Both the lead actors kind looks alike, no doubt on the casting, but it only should have been a bit better in exhibiting story.\r Maybe the pace should have been a little quicker as well as some sentimentally appealing scenes would have done good. I desperate to give more marks, but I can't go beyond this. I won't consider it a bad flick, what I meant was a missed opportunity to be a masterpiece. So overall,  it is a good watch.\r 7/10"

      "text": "A great and thought-provoking drama with a constant trait of all-knowing human sides like love & obsession. It\u2019s a stunning and stylish story that never ends to impress, with its progressive way of presenting this clear and well done character arc; an arc that makes you feel Lili Elbe\u2019s inner fight against the strong want-to; to be able to love, and to be who we are, and not to hide. It might be a bit controversial, but \u201cThe Danish Girl\u201d does stand out with its great and bad aspects. Two are exemplary lightning and very character fitting music; meanwhile mixed editing-quality, misplaced cinematography & some fragments of overacting might be some of the greatest disadvantages of having a such ambitious drama. But the higher purpose of this film overwhelms the downsides by tenfold. It\u2019s the drama we need more of, even though many out there probably will misjudge the whole gender-part.\r Personal rating: 80/100\r\u2028Critical rating: 88/100"

      "text": "Oscar-winning Director Tom Hooper (\u2018The Kings Speech\u2019) and Oscar-winning Actor Eddie Redmayne (\u2018The Theory of Everything\u2019) bring us the life of a male Dutch artist who, with the support from his wife, becomes a woman, in the new film \u2018The Danish Girl.\u2019\r Based on the book of the same name by David Ebershoff, \u2018The Danish Girl\u2019 tells the real life story of Einar Wegener (Redmayne) who never felt right as a man so he decides to transition into a woman, being one of the first known recipients ever of sex reassignment surgery. It was with the support of his wife and fellow painter Gerde Wegener (Alicia Vikander) that gave him the courage and hope that helped him through the transition to live the rest of his life as Lili Elbe. But the film portrays Einar\u2019s transition and Gerde\u2019s acceptance as a dull one, there are no real revelations, nothing exciting about the story, and even Redmayne\u2019s performance is a bit under the radar. It\u2019s Vikander who steals the movie right from under Redmayne\u2019s corset.\r The movie tells us that Einar\u2019s interest in all things Transgender suddenly happened when Gerde asked him to fill in for a female model who didn\u2019t show up for one of her painting sessions. So she asks him to put on a dress so that she can finish the painting. He likes the way it feels, but more importantly he likes the way he looks in it, and this suddenly (a bit too suddenly) awakens Einar\u2019s inner woman. This takes place in 1926 while the couple was living in the liberal land of Copenhagen, though such things were not done, nor not even discussed back then. But with Gerde\u2019s full support, and help, Einar starts dressing up as a woman outside of their house. Things get a bit more complicated when another man, Henrick (Ben Whishaw) takes an interest in Einar, who by this time has started calling himself Lili.\r Gerde is asked to go to Paris so that she can work for a local art dealer, and while her career flourishes, their marriage slowly dissolves. And a childhood friend of Einar\u2019s/Lili\u2019s, Hans (Matthias Schoenaerts) shows up and forms a complex triangle with the couple. And it\u2019s not long before Einar goes ahead with the surgery that will take away his manhood.\r \u2018The Danish Girl\u2019 is dull. It\u2019s not a sweeping European love story where love conquers all in the midst of one man\u2019s gender confusion and one woman\u2019s loyalty to such man. Hooper\u2019s direction can\u2019t bring Lucinda Coxon\u2019s boring script to life. Not even the actors can accomplish this. Redmayne is good as Einar/Lili, yet there were times when I thought I was still watching him play Stephen Hawking. It\u2019s his eyes, he blinks them quite a lot in this film, just like the way he did in \u2018The Theory of Everything.\u2019  However, \u2018The Danish Girl\u2019 is pretty much Vikander\u2019s movie. She\u2019s beautiful and emotional and accepting when the times call for it \u2013 it\u2019s just as good a performance as Felicity Jones was as in \u2018The Theory of Everything.\u2019 Vikander\u2019s star is on a meteoric rise, having appeared in three films this past year (\u2018Ex Machina,\u2019 \u2018The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\u2019 and \u2018Burnt\u2019). She\u2019s currently filming the fifth Bourne Identity film with Matt Damon and Tommy Lee Jones and has two other features coming out in 2016. I was very disappointed that \u2018The Danish Girl\u2019 was not as good as I had hoped, perhaps it might be better to read the actual book, and skip the movie."

He is among the most ambitious and talented actors of his generation, but unlike his unnervingly precise embodiment of Stephen Hawking in \"The Theory of Everything\", his turn as Einar Wegener/Lili Ebe feels largely forced, sans some scenes of painstaking honesty between him and Vikander. The same can be said of the film as a whole. Its technical finery and the relevance of its subject matter notwithstanding, \"The Danish Girl\" dotes on itself too often and is too maudlin to be fully convincing."

      "text": "I think this is an important film, which have to say something definite. First, this is not a film about sexuality, neither of transgender nor of homosexual at all. Secondly, this is not a film about transformation and therefore not a self-made.\r The film is about the limit of liberalism that is reflected (at least put a question) at context of liberalism. We see a classic drama contradiction between collective (family and those relationships that are formed between people) and individual. These are dialectical forces.\r The film beautifully illustrates how individualism (a legitimate desire to be yourself) destroys yourself through rejection of collective significance. Einar Wegener so rush to their own identity that destroyed a family. Despite the actual death, he dies symbolic because beyond happy family relationships did not exist, as there is no man outside society. It's like leave the village at night winter forest and die there.\r Limit of liberalism - a meaningful limit of individuality. We perhaps the word limit is used here not quite correct. Perhaps quite the contrary liberalism have an aim to break the limitations of individualism, and the film shows how the individual psycho-physical determinism destroys him, because freedom that leads nowhere, not freedom."

The perfectionist society in those generations hardly tried to accept it, to accept them for what they are and who they are. However, the hatred still continue until now and maybe in next generations. This explains that no one understands them. It is not sickness. It is not a curse. They are not different.
