Considering it's little more than a gimmick to promote the use of 3d, this film is far better than it has any right to be. The film maker cast the movie well, and made a great decision to make it take place in a modern time period rather than constraining it to being a period piece. It doesn't follow the book very closely, but it has it's own plot that centers around the book. It's nothing deep, but it's great fun."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Excellent Saturday morning fun.

No. Are the visual effects great? No. Is the acting riveting? No. But who cares... it entertainment."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "(Not a rating of movie itself, but more like the plot) How can this be that bad?

We found the 3-D effects to be awesome and realistic.Evidently from the startled gasps of others they agreed. At times you feel a need to move to get out of the way of what looks like objects coming right at you. Loved the story and action and amazingly in today's cinema, not one objectional word or action...hooray!"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "I thought this was a great action movie. It's not a James Bond- type of action film, but it worked out well with some comedy mixed in with it. It wasn't as corny as you might expect it to be. Brendan Fraser and Anita Briem gave good performances It's a good movie to bring the whole family to. The 3D aspect wasn't perfect but definitely made it more interesting. My advice is to sit somewhere in the middle of the theatre."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Amazingly bad dialouge, fx and redicuously unrealistic stunts."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "How people did not learn anything after the first Mummy movie is beyond me.

Once the professor, the nephew, and the tour guide fall into the center of the earth, the movie goes into autopilot and becomes predictable. But this is not a bad thing. Here's a movie that never takes itself seriously and simply admits that it is a silly and campy adventure story. If you just sit back, turn off the brain, and relax, you will enjoy the movie. My only complaints is that the movie lacks ambition and the emotional parts feel cheesy."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "In 3D, in a theater with 1st class projection and the proper screen, this film is the most fun of any I've seen this summer - not the best, nor the most serious, nor the most worthy - just the most fun.

Horrendous story line, horrendous acting...the special effects may be the only redeeming value, but that can't even save this movie. Trite, vapid and a movie that should appeal to small children or those who have been lobotomized. I can't believe anyone would give this movie anything over a score of 1."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "An amusement park for the imagination. How can you go wrong with that? Its one outlandish stunt after another covered in eye candy. If you can turn off the brain, ignore Newton's law of gravity for a hour and a half, and take it for what its worth and I guarantee the entire family will enjoy it."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "A rock pile is found on the littoral of an acheronian beach, determined by the exploration party to be the remains of a long, lost brother and father. Since the laws of physics precludes the deceased from being a gravedigger, basic syllogism dictates that the dead man was not alone. But for some unknown reason, nobody broaches the possibility of being under observation by an other, or that the dearly departed might have been the digger. The two men have a good cry and move on. Maybe the boy's father trained the dinosaur to dig a hole. Attention to detail was apparently reserved for the 3D effects(kind of bitchin'), because \"Journey to the Center of the Earth\" handles this awesome safari like a treacherous camping trip. At one point, Trevor Anderson(Brendan Fraser) tells Hannah(Anita Briem) to go home, as if it was a matter of canoe or raft. All she has to do is reach the river, according to the professor, who must possess some arcane knowledge about vertically flowing water that can bust through layer after layer of rock. What this movie needed was for the actors to convey a sense of their isolation from the terraneous world. They don't seem terribly concerned about where they're situated. As a result, the center of the world seems more like a theme park."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "The best 3D sequences in the movie were the opening and closing credits.

Who cares about the crap that you may lay eyes on? Please, oh please, don't waste your money on this junk. The theaters don't know what junk they're putting out. But, of course, I'm one person, and when you want your money back because you PAID to see it, don't come crying to me when you don't get your money back. If you like the movie, and read this review, I'm quite embarrassed. Anyways, just don't watch this crap."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "I's slightly better than Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, but that's really not saying much.
