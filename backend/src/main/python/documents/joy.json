      "text": "Jennifer Lawrence made a name for herself by starring in The Hunger Games, and she's easily one of the most recognizable actresses in Hollywood. But what does she do now that The Hunger Games has ended? Her first post-HG project is reteaming with David O. Russell, director of Silver Linings Playbook and American Hussle, which netted her one Academy Award win and two nominations (including Joy). Although Joy wasn't as well-received as their other pairings, it still gives Jennifer Lawrence a movie to carry on her own without a franchise title to support her. Joy is a biographical film about the life of Joy Mangano, the inventor of the Miracle Mop, because evidently she needed a biopic. She grew up in a home where everyone around her had a dead-end job, and her grandmother was the only source of optimism for Joy. By the time she's 30, Joy is a divorced mother of two, working a dead-end job, her parents are divorced but still live with Joy, and her ex-husband lives in her basement. To add insult to injury, her sister constantly humiliates Joy in front of her children. The rest of the film is Joy overcoming these obstacles to become an overnight success with her first invention, the Miracle Mop, and selling the product on QVC. It is one of those inspirational bio-dramas we get a few times a year, but it never feels overly sappy or fake. The real issue is the film's first half which drug on about 20 minutes too long hammering in how much the characters' lives suck. Once Joy makes the prototype for the Miracle Mop and starts her business, the movie's quality picks up immensly. You actually start caring about the characters rather than just saying \"Wow, their lives suck.\" The ensemble cast, which includes Lawrence, Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro, does typically great work and salvages the movie's slower parts. Joy is definitely one of those movies that you really go see for the cast, but it's often fun to watch Joy's race to the top even if it takes a long time for her to start."

      "text": "Joy has a lot going for it that ultimately makes me like it more than not, but it is undeniable that this is a deeply flawed film. For starters, Jennifer Lawrence and the entire cast is phenomenal. Many claim Lawrence did not deserve her Academy Award nomination, but my God did she ever. She was stupendous. Not my favorite performance of the year, but certainly up there. Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro were also quite good. Additionally, the pacing was fine, the film was always captivating, and the story had some very good comedic moments that had the whole theater in stitches. However, that is about where it ends. Yes, Lawrence's acting is good enough to outweigh everything else, namely the story. The story and the way it was written is deeply flawed. Based on a real woman, I have to assume the real story could not have been that bad that they had to Hollywoodize everything. Not only does Joy's story follow the traditional character arc and story structure a little too well, it just feels so fake. Even more, much of it designed to remind you of how strong a woman Joy is. I get that she is strong and independent, but I do not need a reminder every five seconds. I have no issue with strong women, but a film about one does not need to keep reminding you of such. Instead, it should demonstrate it. However, this is a sin the film commits quite often, as it often tells rather than shows, namely in the form of its narration. Entirely useless, the narration here is a major cop-out and is used solely to have forced exposition and connect scenes together. The script finds ways to get worse, however, as all of the characters are one-dimensional. Real humans do not act this way, let alone ones allegedly based on real ones. In particular, Joy's half-sister seemed to cruel and mean, yet there has to be more to her tale than the film let on. Ultimately, Joy is compelling, funny, and incredibly well-acted by Jennifer Lawrence, but its story handicaps it throughout."

      "text": "- No Drama + No Comedy - Stakes = Zero Story -\r Mostly, the everyman applauds when another everyman struggles against odds to find success. Sometime those struggles are herculean. Not the case in \"Joy.\" While the real life, inventive Joy deserves kudos, the bottom line is this is a feature film about the creator of a better mop.\r Russell struggles, unsuccessfully, to portray as harrowing the path to the mop. Joy (Jennifer Lawrence), deals with a houseful of kids, only a few of them children by age. The motley crew in a small house is not on Joy's side. She is the breadwinner, the adult, the rock whose imagination is a liability to those overly dependent on her. It's a paint-by-numbers affair from there \u2013 familial jealousy, dirty financial dealings, the nightmare foretold by the old saw, \"Do not do business with your family.\"\r The only one with an eye on Joy's genius is Grandma (Diane Ladd). Joy uses her small crumb of encouragement to build a mop prototype. She brings it to QVC where the initial sale segment bombs. Slick QVC huckster Bradley Cooper takes a chance and allows Joy to showcase the mop herself. Bingo! The mop sells out. Success? Nope. The parts supplier is screwing Joy, every sale of the mop loses money, and the family wants their money back. Financial ruin follows. Then Grandma dies. But the plucky Joy womans up to settle all scores financial and emotional. Hoorah!\r In lieu of dramatizing a woman overcoming, Russell instead created a painfully unfunny comedy. His palette is broad with a spectrum of quirkies mincing about with a family dynamic that could only exist in a poorly written movie like \"Joy.\" The spot-on Russell eventually had to fall. \"Joy\" is the X marking the spot.\r Made-for-this-film, unfunny soap opera segments are unmotivated. There is no subtext pointing to the off-TV characters. There's also no payoff. There are out-of-left-field scenes of the soap in the first quarter and it's never seen again. What's the point?\r The Cooper-Lawrence chemistry bright and vibrant in past screen pairings is absent in \"Joy.\" Here, it's given way to forced discomfort. There's a sense Lawrence, Cooper and DeNiro at some point knew \"Joy\" was a dog and tried hard to not phone it in. That or their direction was, \"You've just been hit by a phaser on stun.\"\r The tonally confused \"Joy\" offers little on the path to an unsatisfying end where Joy makes it big, big, big and helps others succeed.\r There's little sympathy for Joy. The stakes: not living to one's potential and living with unfulfilled dreams. Her children are healthy. Her dad, DeNiro, runs a going concern and could help financially if push came to shove. She's smart and capable of working. Poor Joy.\r One wonders about the scores of courageous men and women who daily struggle against far greater odds, wolves at the door, to put bread on the table. Where are tales of these folks? It's an odd and tragic choice for Russell to highlight Joy's story (and insensitive in the current economy where one in seven US children go to bed hungry). The can-do attitude of a person overcoming trials is powerful. Open your eyes, Mr. Russell. There are far better underdog tales to make. They're just not sexy as Lawrence dancing with a mop."

I can tell the producers definitely tried to add a bit of story and personality to provide a deeper connection between the audience and the mop, which was nice, but they do a pretty good job of just focusing on the mop itself and its many nice features. I am really looking into buying this mop but it is proving difficult to find at the 20$ price the nice blonde lady mentioned in the infomercial. Anyone know where I can order this mop?"

That is true also with Joy.  It is blessed with a star studded cast of actors who probably should have run away from this turkey at first sniff, but wait, David O. Russell has had a string of successes, so what the hey!\r Russell usually has been able to make his films work by moving the story along at a fast enough clip that the viewer doesn't have time enough to dwell on how clich\u00e9 and contrived some of his characters and situations are. That is not the case with Joy. In fact, there are a number of scenes in this movie where the characters are caught in almost Wes Andersen sort of trance-- they have that deer in the headlights look. The difference is that this is not a Wes Anderson movie and the writing and direction is not good enough to make you want to suspend belief. You never really believe in the characters because you never really get to know and care about them enough. Isn't that what any good film should always have at its core??\r Joy throws a lot of star power around with actors like Robert DeNiro, Bradley Cooper, Virginia Madsen, Isabella Rosselini playing the supporting cast, but they are pretty much wasted and only serve to divert our attention away from Jennifer Lawrence's character, instead of helping to illuminate it. You end up simply not caring about her or the others. All the clich\u00e9s are exposed for what they are. Perhaps this is because the original script by Annie Mumulo was reworked by Russell and certain key biographical elements of the real Joy Mangano were taken out? Who knows? What is clear in the end is that this film loses a viewer\u2019s attention one-third of the way through and never gets it back."

Despite how cheesy and uninteresting that sounds this is an excellent movie.\rFirst of all I never really liked most of David O. Russell's films (like Silver Linings Playbook-2012 and American Hustle-2013) but this one truly reveals Jennifer Lawrence's unique talent. She shouldn't have been nominated for Oscar for American Hustle and she shouldn't have won it for her performance in Silver Linings Playbook but in this one her undoubted talent unfolds to such an extent that I now consider her the best actress along with Charlize Theron. We can definitely say she's the next big thing in Hollywood. The story is really interesting and the film never gets tiring despite it's duration (124 mins). Not only that but it's really emotionally moving. In a nutshell you can say that it's an American dream story built through constant difficulties, a modern Cinderella story with a strong anti racist vision. All classes and races may come together and succeed if there is enough talent, confidence and persistence, that's the point of the film. Robert De Niro tries to copy himself in Meet the Fockers and Bradley Cooper is good but nothing special, like in all his movies. After all there is no reason for them to try to challenge the imposing star of Jennifer Lawrence, who really brings \"Joy\" to her character. Needless to say the film got nominated for two Golden Globes, Best musical/comedy and best performance by an actress."

Russell's best film, but this is not terrible despite it's bland,  but Russell's style is vigorous and Jennifer Lawrence's performance is peppy, together their craftsmanship is splendiferous. Originally Annie Mumolo (\"Bridesmaids\") wrote the screenplay in 2013, so Russell signed on to direct also he selected to write the script, he didn't re-write the script, he wrote his own screenplay and Mumolo got the story credit and produced the film, for Russell got the soul screenwriting credit. Here's a fact for ya!: Kirsten Wiig almost starred in the film as \"Joy\" but Lawrence took her place. Jennifer Lawrence stars as Joy Mangano she is the only sensible person in the family, so she's been running around the household most of her life. Things are now complicated, her father Rudy (Robert De Niro) moves backs in to her house after his second marriage has failed, her mom Terry (Virginia Madsen) who is obsessed over soap-operas and watches TV non stop. Joy's ex husband Tony (Edgar Ramirez) lives in the basement pursuing his favorite dream about being a musician, Joy's sister (Dascha  Polanco) who undermines everything she does. Joy's grandma Mimi (Diane Ladd) who's the only one who has confidence in her. Joy has an inspiration for a mop getting it on the market, so she captures the attention of Neil (Bradley Cooper), who runs a brand shopping network called QVC. Tony and her childhood friend Peggy (Elizabeth Rohm) believe in her. Dad's new girlfriend (Isabella Rossellini) invents in her mop, no one thinks she'll achieve any success. Lawrence is wonderful not only she has the star-making is great but so do the chemistry that she, Cooper, De Niro and O.Russell have together, this is the \"Silver-Lining Playbook\" team's third collaboration together, they all love each other on set you could also tell by Lawrence saying about director David O.Russell  \"I want us to be buried next to each other, I really do.\" O.Russell's script is bland, but I am wowed by Russell's style also Linus Sandgren's cinematography not to mention Lawrence's star-making and charisma. I also thought that the film shouldn't win best picture, but it's really a good film. Grade A"

To be fair, Jennifer Lawrence gives a great performance as Joy, but honestly, it's hard to acknowledge her great performance when this movies multiple styles and awkward pace overshadow the main character herself. At one point, it feels like a Scorsese movie, at another point, it feels like it's suppose to be lighthearted. And my God, the pacing towards the last half felt like the fantastic four. A very long first act, no second act, and a rushed 3rd act. There's no clear vision of what this movie wanted to be and the movie made me kind of angry. Overall, there's no point in getting into the story when the movie isn't even sure what it wants to be. I give it a C!"

The movie works in a number of ways (acting, casting, inspirational themes) but drops the ball in others (writing, pacing, staying on point). Had the script and film editing gone through some additional tweaking, this might have been a truly terrific movie, but, as it stands now, it's merely above average. With that said, however, be sure to give sufficient props to Jennifer Lawrence, Isabella Rossellini and Virginia Madsen for great acting turns in their respective performances."

This is the loosely based story of Joy Mangano, the lady who went from rags to riches via the QVC Network after demonstrating and selling her new invention, a mop that never touches your hands and whose head can be washed in a washing machine. The story is really quite predictable with the other actors playing caricatures in a modern Cinderella tale with a heroine who mops the floor and a stepsister who is her arch rival.\rThe dialogue is trite and leaves little to the imagination save the gaps that the viewer must fill in because some of the scenes and scenarios just don\u2019t make much sense.  If you delete the \"J\" from the title of the film you end up with the word \"oy\" and that\u2019s the word I used after I viewed it. I give the film a rating of 6 and suggest that the ticket price would be better spent on buying the mop featured in the story."

Following close are the scenes with Edgar Ramirez as her ex husband still living with her and their two kids. Also living with them are her mother, Virginia Madsen, her father, Robert De Niro, andf her grandmother, Diane Ladd who narrates the movies. Also in supporting roles Elisabeth Rohm as her half sister, Dascha Polanco as her best friend, Melissa Rivers as her mother Joan  along with soap opera icons like Susan Lucci, Laura Wright and Maurice Benard fill in the story with the latter three stretching out the film making it seem longer than it really is.\rThe movie is \u2018based on a true story\u2019 about Joy Mangano\u2019s inventing the self-wringing  Miracle mop and all it took to make it a success from appearing on the QVC channel, being duped by men regarding business, her going into monumental debt and finally standing up for herself.\rAs it is the film is very chaotic with all the family members, the business and TV angle, independent woman in the 1990s, instead of concentrating on that plus her ex, their kids and how she handles all that plus fighting in a business world.\rJennifer Lawrence continues to show her expertise as an actress in playing various roles and doing a good job in each and though she is excellent in \u201cJoy\u201d, the movie itself, as directed and written by David O.

So all the depicted events and characters were partially real, but for the cinematic reason they have been fairly altered for a good outcome. And yes, I loved it. A very inspiring film among all the Oscars nominees this year. In some way I also felt Jennifer Lawrence should have got the award for her fine character display.\r Honestly, I was not interested in this, so I wanted to get over it silently as soon as possible. But I ended up enjoying a lot and instantly it became one of my favourites of the 2015. What I expected after watching its trailer was like I judged it by its cover. As I hesitated in the earlier, but strangely now I'm recommending it to all.\r The story of a woman who grew up listening her grandmother's motivational speeches. But realises the life is tougher than she thought and making a living is very competitive. After so many struggles in the life, she finally invents something that changes her and her family fortune forever. But like any new initiative does face, the problems arise and how she is going to fix them is what the remaining film narrates.\r A very interesting film in the perspective of the career option. Forget the doctors, engineers, lawyers and those who're settled in their lives with a good job in hand that pays big, but there are billions of people, to them it will definitely serve as an inspiration to ignite their future.\r The rating for this looks like a fair value, but still a very underrated film everywhere. Amazing actors, a little funny and a little emotional, but a very impressive film directed by the one who bought the Oscars to Jennifer Lawrence for their earlier venture together. I don't know what's between her and Bradley Cooper, but looks like their onscreen chemistry is doing something big impact. This is their's fourth project together and second with the director, so I hope they do more in the future as well. This is really a wonderful film, so don't miss it.\r 8.5/10"

Once the mop comes into the film though, the movie begins to take off. From that point on the movie is almost never less than solid and occasionally more. You really do root for Joy to succeed and become frustrated at the obstacles set in her way. Lawrence gives a decently engaging performance ,although it's not her career best in my opinion. It's not nearly as consistent as American Hustle or Silver Linings Playbook which were both invigorating their entire runtimes and some of the best movies of the past decade but it's still worth watching if you accept that it takes a while to cohere into an interesting story."

The real strong side of Joy is the great performance by Jennifer Lawrence. I totally understand the Golden Globe nomination.

Now the main issue with the rest of the cast is that they aren't very likeable. Robert Di Niro and Bradley Cooper are both in this film but sadly they are almost unlikeable.

All this is especially problematic w/ the patent issues. Patent law is about as complex and tax law. The film 'wants' us viewers to understand it but doesn't really give us much help (maybe it doesn't understand it either). Also, the woman's success story is admirable but at times it feels like it is straining to be political correct. I'm not sure I'm right about most of the above.

Russell's new film \"Joy\" and it was pretty disappointing. This is coming from a guy who wanted this movie to be brilliant and it was on my most anticipated movie of December, but it sadly didn't live up to that exceptions.\r You had no idea how much I wanted \"Joy\" to be a great movie and also how I wanted it to be David O. Russell's best film, because while I wasn't a big fan of American Hustle (after re-watching a few times) but I thought this movie will bring him back to his old roots, because I've notice he picks style over substance in his last movie (Silver Linings Playbook isn't one of them). The story in the movie seemed to be laid back for David O. Russell, so he doesn't go too carried away with the style he presents in his movies. And there are a few good shots, creative camera work in some scenes, and that's really it. He dose nothing to the story that made it exciting or even interesting. I like David O. Russell as a director, I really do, but this guy is pretty far away from flawless.\r Jennifer Lawrence performance was the one thing that wasn't disappointing. She did a great and strong performance in this movie, but her Long Island accent was a bit off at times and you may think that the actually person herself that Lawrence is playing (Joy Mangano) sounds like that, well I did my research and let me tell you no, she doesn't. But all that side, she did a solid performance and she was the only likable character in this movie. Great work Lawrence.\r The story itself isn't that interesting coming to think of it. Just reading the story of what the movie is about isn't that engaging, but I thought with a huge cast like this, David O. Russell behind the camera and the trailers made it look promising, because maybe these more to this story that we don't know about, but in the movie stuff happens and are main character is going through hell...oh and these the unlikable characters in Joys life. This story is loosely based on Joy Mangano life.\r I didn't give a single crap about any of the character in this movie and that's this movie biggest flaw. All of characters (expect Joy) feels like movie characters and every time their say something it wasn't convincing and didn't feel real. Not once did I feel attached to any of these characters. Theses a lot of characters in this movie played by big name actors, but I just wished it was written and executed better.\r The first half of the movie didn't really know what it wanted to be. It was very scatted as it goes back and forward showing what Joys family life was like. All of that is trying to do some character development or just to flesh out her character, but I wish those flashbacks had a purpose in the rest of the story, as I felt it was thrown in there.\r Overall \"Joy\" isn't a bad movie, I mean Jennifer Lawrence basically saves this movie from getting a much lower rating from me. The movie looked good, it was well shot at times and even when I didn't like the characters in the movie, I still thought the actors where good. I wanted to like this movie but sadly, it was a mess."

And by uniting Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro and Bradley Cooper for the third time, O.

Only for circumstance to conspire with her precocious nature to help her fulfil her potential in this true, and yet rather fanciful tale about never giving up in the pursuit of your \u201cAmerican Dream\u201d.\r \u2018Joy\u2019 certainly does have its redeeming qualities with plenty of offbeat characters and deadpan humour to keep you entertained, for the first half at least. Robert De Niro\u2019s turn as Joy\u2019s self-styled father particularly steals the show, and Jennifer Lawrence central accomplished performance just about holds the movie together. But the tone of the film changes drastically towards the third act and the comedic charm is lost as it moves towards a rather flat emotional character drama.\r No amount of toe-tappin\u2019 tunes will disguise the fact that this film is very uneven with most of the narrative focusing on Joy\u2019s early entrepreneurial days, which then suddenly and conveniently wraps up in the final 10 minutes, with no lead-in, into her current status as a powerful family matriarch, and then that\u2019s it, the film\u2019s over.\r The Bottom Line\u2026\rDirector David O. Russell can\u2019t seem to wrangle a strong ensemble cast, a delightful soundtrack and plenty of belly laughs into a compelling and cohesive rags-to-riches \u201cAmerican Dream\u201d story. \u2018Joy\u2019 is a rather flat and underwhelming comedy/drama that loses steam, let\u2019s see if O.
