This one's somewhere in between. There are good things in this film. The leads are excellent, the sets and cgi are very good, and there are a good number of entertaining set pieces.  But it's incredibly uneven in tone. Tension is announced, rather than built, usually accompanied by an incredibly offputting Metallica based theme.  The fight scenes are rather graphic for the genre too, putting it up to a 12 certificate (that's correct imo) and outside the ideal demographic.  It would really have benefited from the touch of Speilberg or similar.  There's no grandeur or scale to the cinematography and it really suffers for it.

He brought so many comedic moments. 2) Great Comedy And Action The action & comedy were moving along at about the right pace, never dwelling too long on any of the plot points. 3) World-Building The sets, costumes, animals, vibrant colors, darker elements of Amazon, the intro of main characters, every single thing was beautiful enough to maintain the classic atmosphere."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "So boring.

These types of movies are heavy on fake-looking CG, and indignantly hit you over the head with social justice issues, and Jungle Cruise falls squarely into that category. From the beginning Emily Blunt is constantly told that she can't do things because she's a woman, but spoiler alert, she's better at everything then all the men! What a shocking twist! We've never seen that trope before have we? She's even better at fixing the engine of the steamboat than The Rock is, even though he's been using and repairing it for decades. Later on we find that her annoying brother is tagging along on the dangerous journey because he is a homosexual and society back then treated them poorly instead of throwing pride parades for them every day.

I found it to be far far worse.The cast, the only highlight, managed the best they could with the a poor script and terrible direction from Jaume Collet-Serra.  I suppose Disney spent all of its budget on cast and CG with nothing left for an experienced director of effects heavy summer blockbusters.  Warner Bros. needs to rethink 'Black Adam' in a hurry.The characters are uniformly unlikable for the first third of the film and weirdly inconsistent in motivations throughout.The story is okay, but predictable.  You'll probably see a lot of things coming ahead of time.  Generally, the movie seems scripted for kids, but scary moments and some extreme violence are definitely meant for adults.Action scenes, the main reason people will watch this movie, are badly edited.  The beginning or end of some action beats are over-trimmed or from poor camera angles. They leave you scratching your head over what just happened.  Considering the rest of the film, it's quite possible the director failed to shoot enough coverage for which the editor to work.The soundtrack is awful and frequently as inappropriate as the score to 'Ladyhawke'.Effects and CGI work are a mixed bag.  Some is so good, you won't even notice it.  Some is a rip-off of \"Dead Man's Chest\" and will take you out of the moment when you realize it.  The worst is the CG animals, which are shockingly poor and look like they came from a 10 year old video game.Ridiculously jarring is the modern idioms.  They are out of place in 1916 and even further out of place in the Amazon basin of 1916.I won't mention the stuffed in modern politics that don't serve any purpose to the plot or story, but it's 2020's Disney, so you probably already expect it.Of course there are the 'Jungle Cruise' style jokes.  Did I say style?  Nope, many of the jokes are ripped right from the ride.  So, if they were groaners before, they're painful now.Finally, many better movies were shamelessly ripped off. \"African Queen\", which the Disneyland ride was based on, makes up a big chunk of the style and period.  The beginning is largely \"Atlantis the Lost Empire\".  Brendan Fraser's \"Mummy\" is robbed for theming, characters and a ladder gag.  Sean Connery's \"Medicine Man\" is plundered for specifics of the Amazon and plot MacGuffin.  Some backstory is taken from \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl\", with monster design ripped straight from \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest\".  Gags were stolen from \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" and \"Despicable Me\".  Also copied is a tree from \"Avatar\".  There is nothing original.  I recommend watching any or all of those movies instead.There was a time Disney would have hit this out of the park (pardon the pun).  Disney is no longer that studio.  There is little good or entertaining.Do not waste your time.

The acting was in tone and convincing. The soundtrack was pretty bad all along the movie. Way too present in some sequences. Not the best from Newton-Howard.

Jungle cruise has 2 of my favourite actors - Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt - who deliver smashing performances. Their on-screen chemistry is brilliant, and they display their individual passions clearly and credibly. There's a sweet love story here. The villain of the movie hearkens back to the moustache-twirling days of yore, with a ruthlessly driven mind played brilliantly by Jesse Plemons. The dialogue of the film is witty and entertaining, and remarkably sophisticated, tackling sensitive issues with taste and class. The special effects and settings are authentic and really well done. Set pieces are magnificent and breathtaking. You can almost feel the steamy heat of the Amazon in each scene. The supernatural aspect is a nice welcome twist, always. Just like the Pirates franchise, Disney really knows how to spin off classic theme park rides into excellent movies. The jungle cruise within cruise was a funny meta twist. There's a massive twist half way through the movie that absolutely nobody saw coming, which really changes the perspective on a major character. Bravo script writers.

Another weekend, another option from that media conglomerate Disney! The latest adaptation of Disneyland ride into a big budget movie is Jungle Cruise, premiering in theaters and on Disney+ with Premier Access. Disney had great success with the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, which was maybe the first film adaptation of a theme park ride; and it was buoyed by spectacular effects including the daffy, virtuosic performance from Johnny Depp. Why not try again, right? In a sense, it would seem like a movie based on a theme park ride would need an over-the-top hook like a Depp performance to make it work, but Jungle Cruise has The Rock and Mary Poppins 2.0, so... Anyway, here's how Jungle Cruise fared in its waters.I've never been on the Jungle Cruise ride, so I have no idea if there is a storyline there. I'm going to assume there is not, so the screenwriters had to develop a plot to get the characters on an boat in the jungle and stuff happening. The basics of the plot are that Dr. Lily Houghton (Blunt), a brilliant and adventurous scientist ignored in the science community because she is a woman in the early 20th century, sets out to find an elusive tree with healing powers in the heart of the Amazon. Reluctantly accompanied by her younger brother, McGregor (Jack Whitehall), Lily determined with her wits and an ancient artifact believes she can locate the tree and survive the foray into the jungle. Lily and McGregor engage the services of a riverboat man, Frank (Johnson), who has secrets of his own, to get them deep into the jungle. All the while, mysterious strangers and nefarious villain lurk in the recesses of the jungle threatening to derail Lily's quest. Hijinks, puns, and CGI ensue.Look, the story is ridiculous, but it's a Disney movie. It reminds me of the quest to harness Vibranium from Blank Panther. Everything is so broad and vaguely sketched. The villains are evil for evil-sake - there's no definable motivation or characteristic, except that they are bad guys. It does take too long for the Lily, McGregor and Frank to get on the river and on with their quest. I can see a viewer getting a little bored about 20 minutes in. The movie does pick up when some cool special effects show up and inject some energy into the story. Once you get to that point, it should be smooth sailing to the end.On the positive side, Johnson and Blunt are a good big screen pair. They have good chemistry, even if the relationship is ridiculous. Blunt has that easy charm she carries in every role. She's believable as a plucky and headstrong scientist. It's easy to root for her. Johnson has charisma for days. Even though he is saddled with some groan-inducing one-liners and puns, he sells them the best he can and maintains his cool. I'll also shout out Jack Whitehall. He does a great job of keeping up with his superstar co-stars and even steals a scene or two. While I think the CGI is great, it overpowers anything from Edgar Ramirez and what's worse is that is steals from Pirates of the Caribbean without adding anything special. Nevertheless, the production design and magnificent set pieces are a great reason to see this movie.Jungle Cruise is a fun, summer Disney popcorn flick. It has issues with its plot and pacing early on, but it gains steam as it sails along. Blunt and Johnson do a great job of keeping the movie light and entertaining. Even though the story is ridiculous, you at least root for the characters and can get lost in the special effects, sets and costumes. I wouldn't run out to see Jungle Cruise, but a Saturday matinee with a bowl of popcorn, especially with the family, could be fun."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Fun and incredibly charming.

This movie did something few other movies have ever done: It made me resent the time it was wasting WHILE I was still watching it. About a third of the way in, I was already checking out but we had spent the money so I decided to keep suffering through. By the end of the film I was angry at the film for wasting my time, angry at myself for falling victim to the sunk cost fallacy, and dumber for having sat through the entire thing.The plot is nonsensical even by \"Disney themepark rides turned movie\" standards, the runtime is far too long, there's zero feeling of tension or suspense thanks to the constantly bad CGI and cringe dialog. The movie is replete with direct ripoffs of Indiana Jones, The Mummy, the first Jumanji movie, and even Pirates of the Caribbean. The movie doesn't even establish a consistent villain opting, instead, to provide us with two-and-a-half of them: Jesse Plemons' \"Prince Joachim\", Edgar Ramirez's \"Aguirre\", and an utterly wasted Paul Giamatti as \"Nilo Nemolato\", a brief foil to Dwayne Johnson's \"Frank\".So many of the professional reviews say Johnson and Blunt saved this movie but I found them to be the two biggest annoyances in the entire thing. Dwayne Johnson doesn't know what role he's trying to play here -- is he playing the strong guy, the leading man guy, the comedic guy? He tries playing all of the above. His performance is so bad that if you compare it to his other work, films like San Andreas suddenly seem Oscar-worthy. And Emily Blunt's talents are completely and utterly wasted here. Blunt, who elevated lesser movies like Looper and Edge of Tomorrow, who played a fantastic Mary Poppins despite the doubters, and whose range was showcased in both A Quiet Place films was little more than a cheap knockoff of Rachael Wiesz's  \"Evie\" from the Mummy. These same reviews praise their on screen chemistry... What chemistry? All they had were bad jokes. There was no Indiana/Marion or Rick/Evie chemistry in this film compared to Indiana Jones or The Mummy, respectively. Hell, the romantic subplots of the made-for-TV \"The Librarian\" movies with Noah Wyle have more chemistry.1 out of 10, and I'm being generous here. A complete waste of time and space and not deserving of being associated with the word \"cinema\". Complete trash, avoid like the plague. There are literally dozens of better options within the same genre than this tripe."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Disney\u2019s movie version of the Pirates of the Caribbean ride made big money, so they\u2019re going for gold with this classic attraction. Dwayne Johnson plays the wise cracking captain who\u2019s hired by an intrepid researcher (Emily Blunt) to seek a magical tree with special healing powers deep in the Amazon. The supernatural forces and human heavies they encounter provide action beats. Unfortunately, (like so many current films) the staging and editing are so jumbled that much of it is a blur. Still, the pace never lags and there are sufficient scrapes to keep it rolling. Of course, the \"opposites attract\" chemistry between the leads is OK with Johnson landing numerous corny jokes and Blunt looking resplendent (even after going thru much grubby activity). To add comic fun is Jack Whitehall, as her prissy brother (not a stretch for the actor) and kudus to Disney for letting him be semi-subtly gay.

The leads have charm and charisma, but I'd rather spend a half hour with them chatting on, say the Graham Norton show, then two plus hours of this manufactured mess. It wants to be the model of the \"rousing\" adventure with that friendly family feeling from the 80's and 90's. Anytime you see four screenwriters, you're usually in for a bumpy ride. The jokes that don't know when to end. The beating a point over the head till it's flattened (if you had a drinking game every time Blunt' s characters pants are mentioned, you'd be dead by the first hour).

It is a good popcorn movie but will be fast forgotten. I should mention that it is not a Jumanji rip off and based on a Disney amusement park attraction like Pirates of the Caribbean. However it is not as good as either of those two. I would say it is one of the movies where I see great potential and sparkles of awesomeness but it fails to reach the heights. This movie I would describe it as fantasy adventure set in the World War 1 era. It is the story of Dr. Lily Houghton and her brother MacGregor who want to find the legendary \u201cTears of the Moon\u201d blossoms who could cure any injury and illness in existence to help Britain in the war. They want the help of the Royal Society to fiance an expedition to the Amazon River to proof that the tears are not a fairy tale. However the Royal Society do not support them while a stranger wants to buy an artifact from their collection and they will meet a river steamboat captain who is a cunning trickster and badass. This is the set up for the movie. On paper it is excellent and works more than it misses. It has some lengths and gets better when the 3 main actors start the journey on the river. The actors save this movie for me. Lets start with Emily Blunt as Dr. Lily Houghton. She is amazing and fully delivers. Such a great performance that I want to see more. Then we have Dwanye Johnson as Frank Wolff who is a steamboat captain. He is a scroundrel, trickster, equally great. The chemistry and enjoyable banter between him and Emily Blunts character are a strength of the movie. Jack Whitehall as Mac Gregor Houghton is another great asset and shines in his role. Jesse Plemons is a great antagonist and so enjoyable. Maybe a bit to cliche but this takes not away my enjoyment. The rest also delivers and we have a good performance here. The humor works but reaches never a level where I could truly praise the movie. The special effects are top notch and fully convincing. I think the nailed the atmosphere. Overall I repeat my statement. It is a good popcorn movie but fast forgotten except for the great performance of the characters / actors."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "Cringe.
