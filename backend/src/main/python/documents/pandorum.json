It has its flaws and is a bit confusing to follow at times, but it's not unusually derivative, any more than every romantic comedy is derivative or every biopic is derivative. This is an end of the world scenario that mixes in both hard and soft sci-fi and explores worst-case scenarios and mental illness that might exist on a 100-year-plus voyage to another world. If that sounds like subject matter that interests you, you'll appreciate this movie, though you may find stretches a bit dark and dialogue a bit murky at times."

      "text": "I'm somewhat surprised to see a really, really bad review for this movie by the Critics. Maybe 50%, but not as low as 28%. It's like Equilibrium; there's great potential. Don't take this movie as a professional, high-budgeted movie. I will say that this movie would be enjoyable to certain types of people, and based on User Reviews, majority say it's pretty good. If you like survival horror, then this movie might just be for you! Also might be enjoyed by sci-fi fans. And for those Xbox360/PS3 gamers who have Dead Space, this movie is like that (I've noticed that someone else in the User Review mentioned the game too!), but with less shooting and more running away, trying to survive, from man-eating humans. Yes, the main characters are being chased by....humans, or more like humans who evolved to survive inside the ship. I would like to mention for those who can withstand watching horror movies and games, it is not very scary, but more suspenseful, more \"on-the-edge-of-your-seat\" type of movie. So I hope if you do watch it, you love survival and not looking for hardcore horror. I guess it's just how I am, but I like the feeling when the characters have no clue where they are, what they are supposed to do, and they're stuck, trying to figure what is going on, like the game Myst. Yes, it does take patience to finally know the whole scenario. But I liked the plot. Here's a small summary about the movie (I'll try not to spoil) : The main character, Bower, and his Lt., Payton, are awakened in their space ship. After awakening from hypersleep (a long hibernation), they realized the Flight Crew # 5 was not there to greet them (Bower and Payton are Flight Crew # 6, I believe). Flight Crews rotate command of the ship. All non-active flight crew members go back to hypersleep. Bower and Payton became suspicious after realizing that the ship seems to be having problems, especially with the power supply. There was no response from the bridge (command center/navigations/cockpit) and from Flight Crew # 5 (who were supposed to greet Bower and Payton), and thus must investigate what is going on. On Bower's way to the source of the ship's power supply, he discovers these weird humanoids, and they are definitely hostile creatures. From there, he must try to stay alive, while figuring out what happened. He meets a few other survivors, and will sometimes recall some memories that he forgotten (due to temporary amnesia from hypersleep) which will reveal why he was part of the flight crew, why the ship was built, and where the ship was heading (it's main objective of voyage). Though survival horror movies have had a very common storyline (Main character must figure where he/she is, main character must survive, main character kills some enemies, main character is the only survivor, The End.), it is unique compared to others that I watched. I don't know, just give it a try and watch it!"

The plot was unexpectedly twisting and somewhat epic and there is much more to this movie than what the trailers reveal. The directing was great; the close up shaking shots might not be the best for aesthetic purposes, but they are perfect for emulating what a person would see and feel in each situation they were in. Locked in hypersleep for years with memory loss when waking and finding your ship is deserted with ravenous monsters trying to eat you in pitch black corridors.. What do you think you would see while running in fear for your life with your adrenaline pumping at max?? A nice slow and steady camera pan? Sometimes critics are complete morons."

There are enough things wrong with the film to get you distracted if you want it to, but there is a pleasant mix of great things,  that will make this film a classic. The movie is very reflective of the last 20 years of sci-fi, drawing inspiration from classic films but also with a strong computer gaming influence. It is far more subtle than your Hollywood film and is much more raw and independent in feel, and that's what makes classics. Like all great sci-fi, this film does not overwhelm you with technology and science, but draws you to a story about people and their circumstance. I will not be surprised if this film stands the test of time and each year grows a wider appreciative audience."

Most movies these days, I can literally see Every Single Thing coming a mile away. I usually predict every twist before it happens, because movies these days don't think outside the box. This movie was intuitive and had a story that hadn't ever been done before quite this way, and because of the way the characters acted throughout the movie, you couldn't tell what was going to happen next. Usually you see very obvious cues that lead you to think \"oh this is about to happen\" or \"oh he's definitely the bad guy because X, Y, and Z\", but this didn't do that at all, yet everything still made sense when you saw it happen. Critics that gave this any less than a 7 either expect 100m worth of special effects and give a movie bad reviews if they don't have that these days, or they're just paid off, because there's no way the homogenized crap that is a modern marvel movie gets above a 65 while this gets a #$%^ing 28."

Worth seeing for sure, and as with many of the other user reviews I must say I have never disagreed with critics more, their comparisons to previous Sci-Fi films are lazy and poorly considered. Really I think it boils down to the fact that very few critics like sci-fi and they tend to look down on it. I would say if you are a sci-fi fan this is worth checking out."

      "text": "The story of Pandorum focuses on the crew of a sleeper ship called the Elysium and it's inevitable journey through space to their destination, the planet Tanis, which is supposed to be another Earth-like planet. From the beginning of the movie it had me interested, as it tends to keep things very vague, dropping tiny bits of clues as to what is going on. It starts with Corporal Bower (Ben Foster) who wakes from suspended animation and finds that he cannot remember much, if anything, about what is going or where they are. The story takes him on a journey through the ship as he attempts to uncover what is going on aboard the Elysium. Although I do see many strong resemblances or homage's to a slew of other movies, I don't feel the criticism aimed at it is deserved. The flavor of Alien/s and Event Horizon come to mind, but from what I gather the similarities are more superficial than anything else. The cast is pretty decent, with Foster giving a solid and realistic performance in his role. Denis Quaid manages to convey his character of Lieutenant Payton effectively, giving a good performance as well, but really starts to shine towards the end of the movie. The token girl/love interest Nadia, played by Antje Traue, is sometimes shaky in regards to her delivery, but does manage to convincingly play her role as the toughened scientist. She manages to fight well, while not looking like a wafer-thin model like in some movies (cough, cough Resident Evil), and I find that a very good thing. I'm pretty tired of that stereotype and its actually more attractive in my view. Plus shes nice to look at. Anyway the only real character I tended to wince at was Norman Reeduss's Shepard. I dont know if they wanted him to play it that way, but he seemed a bit overdone, but hey, maybe thats what was asked of him or how he wanted to do it. Either way it seemed the least genuine for me. Overall I loved the ambiance of the movie and the pretty realistic actions and reactions of the lead cast to the events that transpire aboard the Elysium. The movie held my interest well, aside from a few hiccups here and there. One of those was some of the B-movie like techniques they used for the action scenes, which to me kind of detracted from the horror of it all. Some scenes seem a little too sped up, while others may have relied on a bit too much slow motion, but all in all the movie has a certain style that appealed to me. It aint Shakespeare, but then again, its not trying to be. Definitely worth a look.\u00e2"
