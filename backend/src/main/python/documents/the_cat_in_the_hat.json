You get \"The Cat in the Hat,\" one of the worst films of all time. Poorly-acted, poorly-written, completely inappropriate for it's intended audience, indescribably annoying, and filled with awful, annoying characters, \"The Cat in the Hat\" becomes unlikeable from the jump. As soon as I saw the Cat on the poster...well, I jumped because he looked kinda creepy, but I also knew that I was in for a bad time. If I can say ONE good thing about this abomination, it's that it's relatively short, but this definitely feels much longer than the 82 minutes it claims to be. This film is an absolute travesty, and no one deserves to put themselves through this. Please, don't watch this. I BEG of you, DO NOT watch this film UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES."

      "text": "Where do I begin to describe this awful mess of a film? A film that has no right to be called a \"family film\", a film that does everything it can to not be funny, a film that wastes the talent of Mike Myers in the lead role as Dr. Seuss' \"The Cat in the Hat\".\r The movie, directed by Bo Welch, sees two kids Conrad (Spencer Breslin) and Sally (Dakota Fanning) often misbehaving, and their single mother, Joan (Kelly Preston) who works in a Real Estate tries to get them to understand how to behave. Conrad ends up messing the house up, and it seems that Joan is dating their next door neighbor, Lawrence (Alec Baldwin), which Conrad isn't happy with.\r One day, the kids find out that there is a strange, human-like sized cat in their house, this turns out to be \"The Cat in the Hat\" (an obnoxious Mike Myers), who causes chaos once he has entered their lives. We see the Cat doing many crazy and obnoxious things, much to the point where you'd think the movie's plot has gone out for a walk. The colorful cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki, is more of an eye-sore than it is eye-popping. There is no sense of realism, but at the same time, there is also no sense of whimsy... it lives in a fantasy world where everything is animated to the point where you'd also think, why is this live action, again?\r The humor in this film is also ill-timed, take a scene for example, where Mike Myers' the Cat sees a picture of the children's mother and his hat expands in size as he lustfully gazes at this picture, then the kids tell him that's their mother. Adult humor is allowed in kids' films and can work, but only when its subtle, this joke was not subtle in the slightest. None of them are. Take another scene, where we see our main characters riding along some kind of fantasy roller-coaster, and then the movie stops just so Mike Myers, as the Cat, can insert a little plug to a Universal Studios ride. The product placement and obvious advertising is shameful and should not have been in there to begin with.\r This is a painful movie to sit through, none of the jokes are timed properly, none of the plot makes much sense, and the movie is just weird to look at. Family films could not get more obnoxious than this."

The next time I see this movie, I'd only be in it for the logos and then leave afterwards. We all thought this movie could be family-friendly after seeing the logos, but nope... we were all wrong. It's like they threw away the charming from the book and use Mike Myers to destroy the movie to become such a mature movie for kids who loves the Cat in the Hat book.\r How did Mike Myers destroy this movie you say and what mature content am I talking about? Look at the many double entendres this movie is hiding and look at the potty humor this Cat's up to. Maybe Tim Allen could be a better Cat."

      "text": "It became popular to hate on this movie years ago and it's really unjustified. There's a few things contributing to the hate. First, it's aimed at older kids and the mum forced to watch with them, not the adults commenting. Second, Dr Seuss is a popular author, but only in some places. In places like where I live, hardly anyone grows up reading Dr Seuss. This is nothing like its source material. It's sarcastic and third-wall breaking. Third, all it takes is some person on Youtube saying something is bad for my generation to pretend they have no ability to think for themselves. Movie critics on Youtube hate this movie. But for me, I liked this when it came out. It was funny and campy like watching the old series of Batman. Yes, the humour is the kind you roll your eyes at, but that's what it's meant to be. This isn't aiming for groundbreaking. It's aiming for a casual Saturday afternoon where your kids are watching Looney Tunes. It's not aiming for accuracy, it's aiming for parody. And it succeeds. Looney Tunes did the exact same **** But notice how nobody breathes a word of criticism? As for Mike Myers, I liked him in this role. I think people saying he's miscast is, I think, an example of how some people just don't get this brand of humour. He was fine for the kind of role this was."

      "text": "This film is extremely underrated and misunderstood, and I am going to explain the truth about it in this review. Though it is quite different to the book which it is based on, it is hard to make a very short book into a long film. Also, it is hard to make a non animated version of a Doctor Seuss film. I think this film has become popular to hate, many people I've seen talking about it haven't even explained why they don't like it, they're probably just following popular culture. Sure Doctor Seuss's wife made it clear after this film was made that she hated it, but she was probably fed up after all the Doctor Seuss film adaptations up to that point, this film was probably just the final straw before she banned live action adaptations of Doctor Seuss's book. The acting in this film is good, so is the set design. The villain in it gets his comeuppance, it is funny when the fish says \"Oh my cod''. This film adds in interesting subplots, it isn't too long, it has a good soundtrack and it is fun to watch because of it's craziness."

Mike Myers was actually pretty good as the cat in my opinion. He was the best thing about the movie! I had a lot of laughs and my biggest complaints were the fact that there were a few SUPER gross scenes, and I found the mother's boss annoying.
