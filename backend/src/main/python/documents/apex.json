      "text": "Wow. This is a really bad movie. Doesn't Bruce Willis have enough money? This light-weight and reheated premise could hypothetically work with Mr. Willis' taciturn charisma (see R.E.D., Die Hard*, 5th Element, etc.). But this is a boring, insulting, erratically paced, waste of 93 minutes. Oof. Advice - watch any other Bruce Willis movie instead."

      "rating": "0",
      "text": "This direct-to-video feature is banking on name recognition but has zero redeeming features, not least of all the lacklustre performance by Bruce Willis. The cinematography would barely be passable  for a high school student film. The plot had potential but its buried under poorly written dialogue and terrible acting. No doubt this film took at most a week to shoot and Bruce Willis got paid handsomely for turning up but at what cost to his reputation. Tricking audiences into watching mediocre rubbish by headlining a once-famous actor can work a few times but eventually the audience gets wise to the deception. Avoid this film. It\u2019s not even entertaining in a \u201cso bad its funny\u201d way. It\u2019s just bad."

      "text": "There will be no nostalgia or good will left for Bruce Willis if he keeps on dialing in some terrible films. Neal McDonough takes up some of the slack in Apex, but otherwise its filled with wooden acting and terrible dialogue. There are few, if any, redeming features."

      "rating": "1",
      "text": "This movie is just terrible all around. Terrible acting, corny one liners, not really science fiction just a movie with a hologram effect on one character. I was hoping Bruce would come back to making at least a watchable movie after his last few disappointing outings, but his bills must be large to sign onto this garbage. Basically B movie quality everything that would have been a straight to DVD or VHS release in the past."
