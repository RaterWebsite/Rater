We complain about acting, about facts, about realism. Then we complain this or that is not true, or this and that is ripped off that guy's book. HEY. Let me remind you something real quick, boys. A movie isn't reality. V for Vendetta is an attempt at reproducing a book's story into visual interest. Had they actually made the entire book into a movie, you'd not have two hours on your hands, but perhaps SIX full hours. [***SPOILERS***] Many of the events were crossed out to squeeze the movie into something as short as possible, while remaining entertaining. What REALLY MATTERED about this movie's success, was that it STAYED loyal to its origins. Not that it entered the norms of literacy and whatever other crap some of you may complain about. In terms of cinematography, this movie blends in together theatrical pleasure and drama perfectly well. You might as well feel that most scenes are shot much like a Shakespearian play. (I'm gonna get flamed for this one in the future) You may be called simplistic by some pseudo-intellectual people for liking this movie. But what counts is not the quantity of references you may attach to it. It's the quality of them. The movie stayed true to the book in many facts, aside that it replaced the past of the book with today. Instead of the Cold War ending with general nuclear warfare, it was America's war on Iraq which spread out too much for its own good. It's not very likely to happen, but the movie reflects \"what ifs\". Other people may even complain about not understanding a thing that is said. Those people just are looking for a typical action movie, where nearly no acting is given and more gunning and killing occurs. V justified every fighting sequence, and made them count into the storyline. Now, remember dear children of cinematography: You're not looking for pure masterpieces when watching a movie. You're looking for entertainment and something of VISUAL and AUDITIVE quality. You may discuss politics when watching the news, otherwise you are just messing with the useless."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I don't know the original graphic novel so I can't determine how faithful the adaptation is.

However, the production is both propelled and impaired by the Wachowski Brothers' influence - the stylized violence is bound to be campy in a few years' time and the dramatic storyline is carried too much by actors with the same serious deadpan British accent (hearing just audio, I doubt I'd be able to differentiate the voices.)

Terrible dialogue, subpar acting, wrapped in a story filled with absurd, juvenile politics with obvious and obligatory nods to the present-day \"War on Terror\" for easily amused critics to fawn over.

Don't be fooled by the trailer, there isn't enough action to provide half-decent entertainment. Instead the Wachowski Boys are trying their damnedest to be intelligent and they just make everybody sound stupid. There is a fine line between poking fun at the British and being completely patronizing. Maybe that can explain the good reviews of this film over on that side of the Atlantic, but I can't explain the good reviews of it that we've had over here. There is nothing to recommend this film apart from a mildly amusing Benny Hill type sketch in the middle. Utterly cringeworthy. I was embarrassed that I had recommended going to see it."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This has to be one of the best movies I\"ve seen this year [so far]. It's great when an action movie, well, doesn't use action to move the story. Hugo Weaving once again amazes me at his ability to act any part, and he made V a very likeable character. Natalie Portman was pretty good, I guess. But as I mentioned earlier about an action movie that doesn't use action to move the plot, V for Vendetta ending action was executed perfectly. It also showed that V isn't perfect. I always love when a movie gives me the shivers. And that makes a great movie."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Very dissapointed, most of the Anti-Bush down with America crowd will resonate with it and give it high marks, I personally thought it was rubbish, I was nodding off.

I appreciate that the filmmakers tried to tackle some social/political points, but they focus on ideas that have been studied for many years. The plot, action and subtext are derivative of other films and books. V is an interesting character, though I don't know why he has to carve his initials like some others I've seen before...maybe we should call him Voro. Also, sort of boring for an action movie. Nice try though."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Decent movie, but it's slow pace will mean many might not like it!"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "The best film since Forty Year Old Virgin."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Politics really shouldn't even come into the equation. This is about rating a film. Was it well made? And the measure of that is whether people are entertained. Obviously, many people were, and a few were not. I enjoyed certain parts of the film, excited to see the characters and events from one of my favorite books. I try to distance myself from the source material when I see an adaptation, but I couldn't help thinking all the way through the film that it would've been so much better if they'd left a lot of things as they were. I agree that this was billed too much as an action film, and its really not. And that's not a bad thing. But to me, knowing the original text, I was dissapointed in the actual content and dialogue of the film. The \"message\" is not delivered in anywhere near as intelligent a fashion as done by Alan Moore. Few can match his talent. I tried to view the film as a piece by itself, but while it wasn't neccesarily a bad film, it just didn't do it for me. The only acting that really bothered me was John Hurt, chewing the misc en scenery. For the record, this is the director's first film. Someone on here called it his worst film yet. How can that be if its the first one he's made? I also agree with the comment that some scenes were \"Matrixy.\" If you were at all moved by this film, I urge you to go read the original graphic novel, and see how much more intense and meaningfull it is. All that being said, and while I hesitate to bring up the political aspect, it must be addressed. I felt it was a little too obvious that they were trying to make references to our current political atmosphere. And that cheapens the original story. I know very little about Margaret Thatcher, but I don't believe that Alan Moore shoved any references down people's throats. This movie also might've been much better if it had been made pre-9/11, or much further in the future. Nothing that comes out these days can speak about the government or terrorists without being labeled as a statement on politics. Lastly, why are there so many comments from the editor being stuck into our own reviews? They seem to be conveying the editor's own opinion of our reviews, when this is supposed to be our way of openly expressing our opinion. Just edit. Don't give us your opinion on our thoughts. Thank you. [Ed: Well said.]"}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Boring, long, and yet again proof that the Wachowski's are terrible writters who somehow fluked into the first Matrix movie.

This is a movie that cant be deemed important or deeper than it claims to be unless you are 15 or younger. Some good acting from Portman and a very suttle Stphen Rea. John Hurt is over the top creepy. Weaving is dashing although you never get to see him, but I couldnt help feeling that this movie was trying to make a statement. I ssues about the Koran and repression of gays, etc.. But how do they answer these problems? By blowing up buildings and killing people! Not only that but once the biuldings are blown up and people are killed(many through out the film) where do they go from there? A question this movie fails to answer and chooses to ignore. I couldnt help thinking how Osama bin Laden would love this movie's dim message and how Ghandi and Martin Luther King Jr. would be rolling in their graves. Go see it if you want to have to be entertained for a think free price, but if you are looking for a moral lesson on violence while be engaged visually, check out Munich or A History of Violence."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Just got back from V for Vendetta.

Give me a break. Moore tackled issues of complicity and how fascism can be taken as a viable system of government. He created a piece of work that demmands introspection from its audience.
