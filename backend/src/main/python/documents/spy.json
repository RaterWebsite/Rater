      "text": "Melissa McCarthy stars in 'Roseanne Blart: Spy Cop', playing a desk-bound CIA analyst who volunteers to go undercover and find a deadly arms dealer. Okay, i'm sorry, let's try and be professional.\r 'Spy' is the first Melissa McCarthy film i\u2019ve seen, and without doubt it will definitely be the last. It\u2019s written and directed by Paul Feig, the man who thinks he understands the Ghostbusters franchise so well he wants to reboot it with a female cast, because that\u2019s the cool thing to do these days, right? Is there an agenda in Hollywood that is pushing Feig and McCarthy? Did i miss a meeting or a memo?\r Anyway, despite an impressive cast featuring Rose Byrne, Jude Law, Jason Statham, and Peter Serafinowicz, the film is the most mediocre garbage i\u2019ve seen this year. Thumbs up to Byrne and Statham playing characters out of their comfort zone but the tired, forced stupidity was overbearing. Throw in an eye rolling cliche cameo from rapper 50 Cent, and you're all set for a complete waste of time. I feel dirty just thinking i spent two hours watching this. Why is it two hours long? It\u2019s \u2018comedy\u2019 consists of jaw dropping, bottom of the barrel material such as fart jokes, dick pics, racial stereotypes, racist abuse, fat woman shouting and fat woman falling over. I wasn't fooled by the 'razor sharp wit' that is actually random, dumb, irrelevant humour which will appeal to the lowest common denominator. It's the go-to structure for lazy mainstream comedies today.\r Do you remember intelligent, well written spy/agent comedies such as Pink Panther, Naked Gun or more recently Red and The Kingsman? Well you won\u2019t find anything remotely similar here! It\u2019s shocking Spy is being praised as \u2018progressive\u2019 and full of \u2018belly laughs\u2019. More like \u2018formulaic\u2019 and full of **** Despite her tag as the female Kevin James, I gave McCarthy a chance. Despite the trailer looking average, i gave the film a chance. Boy, should i have gone with my instincts."

In this movie, if you are an ugly woman, you make awesome stuff. If you are a beautiful woman, you do crap stuff. If you are a man, you can't make great stuff, you will fail or be saved by an ugly woman. All along the movie, men make sexual harassement on the woman \"hero\". For the rest, it's just bad written, it's boring. Only the first scene is nice, when you see the spy and his agent (a \"normal\" person) working together to make the mission successful. They should have work on that. I was out of the movie when the \"normal\" person started to act like a superhero. It was 3 painfull hours. I almost regret to have watching this crap. I didn't enjoy the movie. It's a bad spy movie. Don't waste your time here. Those great actor skills are wasted in this movie."

      "text": "OK, so this looks like an interes...oh my God! its another bloody Bond parody!! seriously!!! Yes the modern age feminist hipster, Paul Feig, takes a swing at the Bond genre, and oh what an original concept that is, gee I wonder what we'll see here...ugh!\r So naturally its an adult comedy with lashings of semi-serious action, CGI blood, swearing and a whole heap of Melissa McCarthy and other actresses. Basically the plot revolves around McCarthy playing Cooper, a desk jockey CIA analyst who helps the very suave, completely clich\u00e9d character of Fine played by Jude Law. Yep, if you ever wanted to see what it would be like having Jude Law as Bond, well here you go. After a botched mission Fine is supposedly killed off and the CIA need someone to take his place, an unknown, hence they can't use Statham who plays another totally clich\u00e9d agent character we've all seen before. We then follow Cooper around as she slowly but surely sinks deeper and deeper into a mission, which she was never really suppose to get into in the first place (she was only meant to be surveillance).\r Oh geez where to start, the plot is unoriginal sure, we all know that, but how about some original ideas...oh too late. From the very first scene I had a good idea what this film was aiming at and how the characters would play out. Spoiler alert! but the minute you see Law as this debonair spy, you know he's obviously gonna die early on, he's clearly the plot setup for McCarthy's Cooper, I mean come on, who didn't see that?! But wait! as the film progresses and more and more characters are introduced, we start to see double agents and characters popping up outta nowhere who are suddenly spies or assassins. All of sudden characters we saw at the start who appeared to just be the butt of a joke or background fodder, are now main characters out to kill the protagonist. Its at this point you know that anyone is fair game and anyone can surprisingly come back from the dead when you thought they had been killed off. So I quickly realised that Jude Law probably wasn't dead at all. Seeing as we didn't actually see him die, clearly he can come back, and he did...*groan*\r The plot is a mess of characters bouncing back and forth between the goodies and the baddies. Seriously, there are characters popping up all over the place, getting whacked, and then replaced minutes later by new ones, only to get killed just as quickly. The ones that don't get killed, you just know are probably gonna turn out to be secret agents, but on either side. I honesty thought Law's character of Fine was gonna keep flippin' sides! he was a goodie, then a baddie, then a goodie again, but at this point I genuinely suspected he would turn on Cooper yet again right at the death, and then get properly killed off. Amazingly the film beat me on that one, but this film could of kept spinning these characters round and round, one double agent twist after another.\r The actual characters are a completely mixed bag of nuts that all had one thing in common, none of them managed to actually make me laugh...at any point. McCarthy was...well, pretty much like McCarthy is in every bloody movie she's ever done (whilst looking oddly like Dawn French at one point), whilst her sidekick, played by Brit Miranda Hart, was just simply annoying and unfunny. I swear, an early scene near the start has McCarthy and Law in conversation at dinner, they are both talking about themselves and offering basic foreshadowing of things to come. Now initially there are moments that made me smile (as there were throughout this film), but this obviously intended funny sequence just went on and on and on...it just didn't f*cking stop. Like seriously, the moment has passed, the joke is over, its not funny anymore its just awkwardly embarrassing, stop flogging this dead horse!!\r The only characters that did offer some genuine giggles were Statham as a dumb, cocky but tough agent, nothing gobsmackingly funny mind you, but reasonable. Next to him I quite liked Peter Serafinowicz as the slimy Italian (yet another secret agent) Aldo who can't keep his hands off the ladies. Sure this character felt like a cheesy 'Carry- On' character (something I would of thought was beyond the realms of acceptance for Feig), but his antics were amusing. Other than that everyone was just there, doing exactly what you expected them to be doing with these character types. Get a load of Law by the way, how much flippin' makeup?? Oh and both Statham and the main baddie fall into the lake from that helicopter at the end, so why does only Statham survive?\r I know this movie was relatively successful but I don't really understand why. Yes some parts were good such as the gadgets sequence near the start which is obviously yet more parodies of a certain franchise, and I did quite like how the main female villain was a spoilt bratty Princess type, although again that did become annoying at times too. But in general everything just felt very generic to me and relied far too much on feeble visual gags including male genitals and slapstick, lots of profanity and lots of weight/looks shaming jabs. Even the inclusion of lots of blood and a bit of gore didn't do anything for me, that just felt unnecessary and shoved in to appease the male audience. I would say this was more enjoyable than 'The Heat' which was pretty dire, but at the end of the day, I found this to be an infantile, factory assembly line, cookie cutter of a flick."

Melissa McCarthy is brilliant as were Jason Statham, Rose Byrne and British comedic actress Miranda Hart. If you get a chance watch, all of the end credits all the way through, as they have a bunch of other possible scenarios of future \"Susan Cooper\" adventures. I smiled through almost the entire film and even laughed out loud several time. It's very entertaining and a huge improvement over \"Tammy\", which may be one of McCarthy's worst films."

The performances, especially Byrne's and Statham, are hilarious. But obviously, the real winner in this film is McCarthy. She just walks on with her sad costume and proves everyone just how bad-ass and agressive she can be while remaining the character with the wittiest, funniest one-liners.

She's one of my favourite actresses, even I enjoyed thoroughly her under-appreciated 'Tammy'. So this is where the action stars become comedians and comedians action stars. Indeed, it worked out so well.\r It shames comedy-spy flicks like 'The Pink Panther', 'Johnny English' etc. From the director of 'The Heat', helmed another perfect female oriented comedy. Jude Law was a decent as usual, but Jason Statham was unbelievably awesome in his tiny part. I had plenty of good laughs, the loud ones after a long time. I still remember the unicorn joke and I can't stop laughing. And roof over a bike, gadgets and so on... I find Melissa McCarthy's line deliverance are so funny and I enjoy her films specially for that reason.\r I know they used a stunt double and blue/green screens in the crucial segments for a better result. But still she excelled in all stunt sequences that required physically herself in front of the camera. One of the trivia says, after the end of each day shooting, she looked like fell down an elevator shaft. Her hard work definitely paid off very well.\r There are lots of adult oriented comedy, so strictly it is for grownups only and may be matured teens. I'll be definitely disappointed if they won't make a sequel for this. If they do, I hope they retain all the cast, especially Statham along the lead actress. And finally I'm looking forward the director-actress's the third collaboration, 'Ghostbusters'.\r 7\u00bd/10"

      "text": "Just when I thought that Melissa McCarthy had worn out her comedic welcome (thanks to Tammy and Identity Theft, a bad one-two punch), I guess all she needed was her Bridesmaids and The Heat director Paul Feig to get her out of her slump. The plot is very similar to Get Smart (or even Johnny English). When all the other agents are compromised, a lower level assistant is recruited to field work. The difference is that McCarthy's character is very good at her job. And it's the characters she bounces off of and their interaction that makes this movie work, beside the chase scenes and action sequences (which are all staged well) . Jason Statham plays off his macho image brilliantly, with every manly boast getting more absurd. Rose Byrne continues her comedy streak as the **** And just as Fieg introduced Rebel Wilson to American audiences in Bridesmaids, Brit Miranda Hart is great as the gawkward best friend. A pleasant surprise."

What really makes this movie work is that it is just as much of a spy thriller as it is a comedy. It is thoroughly entertaining in both aspects. Another reviewer said she just randomly turns into a competent agent, but I don't think that is the case. I think she was competent from the beginning. The problem was just that they didn't believe in her. There's often talk of badass females in action movies and this is one of them. The story in my opinion is intelligent and layered, which makes for an exciting movie going experience. Definitely one of the most entertaining movies I've seen this year."

She portrays her character in such an endearing way yet at the same time is utterly hilarious. The rest of the cast is also fantastic. Rose Byrne is great with her constant put downs and a scene with her and McCarthy on a plane is hysterical. Miranda Hart is also terrific even though I initially thought her out of place but once she moved out into the field in the second half of the film I could not take my eyes off her and found that she stole scenes with great one liners or even just funny mannerisms. Jason Statham was perhaps not as funny as I was expecting but he was still great delivering his lines in a comically dead pan voice.The most plaudits must however go to Paul Feig for managing to create a film that was hilarious yet also riveting through its many plot twists and action sequences. His writing was so brilliantly specific to each character, something that only heightened the comedy. There were also many occasions during the film when lines became inaudible due to the laughter of myself and the audience at a previous line or action."

Then there are her priceless facial expressions. Hilarious. I would have given this flick an 8 if it weren't for the overuse of the f-bomb. It seemed as though the screenwriter opened that spigot in the last quarter of the movie, and those bombs soon felt contrived and utterly gratuitous. I served 20 years in the Navy, and I don't remember sailors using such language. Have never understood why Hollywood writers feel so inclined to use it with such a heavy hand .

The first few minutes could easily be a James Bond movie with Jude Law in the role, but soon we are taken on a different path.

He directed the movie pretty good and although out the film I keep thinking of The Heat that he did and I'm saying that in a positive way as it shows he can mix action with comedy very well. Great work Paul Feig.\r The rest of the cast in the movie like: Jude Law, Rose Byrne and Jason Statham all three did great in the movie as both got they own funny lines and at least they wasn't wasted like in some other movies seem to do with a big cast like this, but luckily it worked out fine.\r The writing was good, the one liners in the movie has to be funniest one liners I've heard since the movie Whiplash and some of jokes really worked.\r Now for the problems: Some of the jokes in the movie are sometimes predictable and just fell flat to me. I know this may sound like a small little nick pick to most people but the movie has a Jame Bond like opening just like Bond films always open but of cause this movie does it's own take on it and it really wasn't all that good, as I said before it's a small little nick pick but it could have been a lot better, I'm just saying.\r Overall Spy is decent comedy and it's way better then some spoof movies on spy films. The acting was good, some of the jokes worked, Paul Feig directed the movie with style by mixing the action and comedy and the movie is enjoyable to watch."

Pros: The jokes are consistently good and this is easily's McCarthy's best work to date. Cons: Over stayed it's welcome a bit with a 2+ hour run time. Bottom line: I'd almost guarantee Spy is a better movie than what you're expecting."

      "text": "Maybe I set my expectations on this one a little too high, because after reading the rave reviews I went in expecting a lot. And while it was undeniably entertaining, it did fall a bit short on laughs for me. But on the plus side, the whole cast gives great performances. Melissa McCarthy once again does what she does best, owning every scene she's in with great and humorous results. Jason Statham was also surprisingly funny, as was Rose Byrne, who departs from her usual sweet and innocent roles as the film's villain. Jude Law also gives a funny and worthwhile performance. The action was also fun to watch and never let up. Overall, while it wasn't quite as funny as I had hoped it would be, there wasn't a dull moment in the film and it kept me entertained from start to finish, which is enough for me. It may not be Paul Feig and McCarthy's best (I still like Bridesmaids the best) but it is a step above their last film The Heat."

Some of the characters were believable but others weren't.  An overweight middle aged woman casted in a role to fight professional killers is a bit much. So I give it a 6.5 overall and that is being generous"

In other words, the movie is funny. It's not a spook spoof, it's a spy comedy, with lots of kinetic talent, instant classic lines (aforementioned zingers) in the vein of \u201cTop Gun\u201d and a great sideshow of Statham spoofing Statham."

Spy is unnecessarily vulgar and graphic, none of it amusing and once again McCarthy is just over the top. Rose Byrne was a huge disappointment. I really wanted to like the movie I had high hopes but it was just too noisy, unfunny and underwhelming."

Along with McCarthy you also get Jason Statham, Jude Law, and Rose Byrne giving great performances.  This is a funny movie in which you still care about the spy elements.  A-"

Although, most of those moments came in the first half of the movie and was mostly due to Melissa Mc., Miranda H. and Rose B. and their chemistry. Three ladies made this movie better than it really is. Jason S. had his moments as well, but the ladies take the crown. Even though I'm usually not a fan of this type of comedy, I gotta admit that Byrne's snarkyness, Hart's goofyness and McCarthy's (almost) everything made my evening."

Everything  in the film feels fresh and exciting: the locations, the cinematography, the jokes, the sight gags, the satirizing of the espionage genre, and the A-list cast. I was never once bored in this flick; it even features 50 Cent! This is ten times better than Bridesmaids."

But after seeing her dramatic work in St. Vincent this year, and her returning to a great comedic role in Spy (for which she was nominated for a Golden Globe), it looks like she may go back to making good movies again"
