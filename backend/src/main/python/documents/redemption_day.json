The main character is a U.S. Marine, who offers a positive representation of a person of color, showing great courage and perseverance to protect his family and the people he loves. The movie also successfully demonstrated the importance of teamwork.I would have given the movie an 8 or 9 rating, but it is under unjustified 0/10 attack by the Algerians, although it addresses an issue that most countries of the world suffer from, which is terrorism. This is why I gave the movie a rating of 10/10 to balance the reviews."
