Luckily Toy Story 2 meets the standard perfectly, however does not exceed the awesomeness of the first film, but instead compliments it.\rSo a few years have passed since the events of the original Toy Story and Andy has now reached his early teens, slowly growing out his toys. When clearing out his room Woody is accidentally thrown out and picked up by a toy collector to be framed for the rest of his life. Buzz and the rest of the gang from the first film go after Woody to rescue him and get him back to Andy before he returns from summer camp. However as Woody starts to learn that it wont be long until Andy no longer needs him and he starts to form new relationships with the collectors current set of toys he becomes reluctant to leave and go back to Andy.\rToy Story 2 takes all of the stuff that made Toy Story awesome and exaggerates it to make a much 'bigger' film without making the first one feel 'small' in comparison. It does nothing new but it delivers a concept we can all relate to and can learn from whilst providing us with an entertaining cast, well animated and generally awesome film."

The storyline and plot were awesome. Woody gets stolen by this fat guy who goes to Tokyo, Japan. (Lived in Tokyo for 2yrs.) At least Woody got repaired. I give this a 9/10 because of the crappy Barbie. She sucks! Well, in her own series. That's for sure. Great movie overall, and if you liked the first one, I totally recommend watching this."

The comparison between these two franchises will be pursued no further, given their utter dissimilarity. But John Lasseter and his team, their confidence clearly bolstered by the massive success of their 1995 blockbuster, have conspired to vigorously push the new entry further with fresh characters, broadened scope, boisterous humor and, most of all, a gratifying emotional and thematic depth. Disney and Pixar have an end-of-millennium behemoth here, one that, given its far greater appeal to girls by virtue of its female co-lead, could easily surpass the $362 million grossed by \u201cToy Story\u201d worldwide.\r The only thing this sparkling picture lacks, by definition, is the shock of the new; four years ago, it was startling to behold the frontier that computer animation had conquered, to see what vast possibilities were now available in the whole field of animation. But there is no sense of complacency or sameness, as the filmmakers get their charges out of the house and into a situation that gives their lives more poignancy and awareness of mortality than, frankly, most characters in live-action films are accorded these days.\r After an overly assaultive outer-space teaser that will nonetheless serve its purpose of getting kids to shut up and pay attention, brisk set-up sees the affable Woody eagerly anticipating being taken to a summer Cowboy Camp by his owner, Andy. But excitement quickly turns to crushing disappointment when a \u201cbroken\u201d arm causes Woody to be left behind, with Andy\u2019s mom adding the final sting with the comment, \u201cToys don\u2019t last forever.\u201d\r Woody\u2019s nightmare of being flung into the trash heap of broken toys comes true when he inadvertently lands in a yard-sale 25\u00a2 bin, from which he\u2019s kidnapped by the greedy Al McWhiggin, owner of the local Al\u2019s Toy Barn, who knows something that Woody himself doesn\u2019t \u2014 that Woody was a big TV star back in the \u201950s.\r Stashed in a downtown building, Woody meets cowgirl Jessie, Stinky Pete the Prospector and a horse named Bullseye and, in a wonderfully entertaining interlude, learns of his long-ago celebrity on a show called \u201cWoody\u2019s Roundup,\u201d a kids\u2019 favorite in which Woody and his new acquaintances were puppets. Not only that, but a whole line of commercial products revolved around the show, including the cereal Cowboy Crunchies. Al\u2019s impressive collection of Woody memorabilia was incomplete without its centerpiece, but now that Woody is safely in hand, Al plans to cash in by selling the whole set to a museum in Japan.\r Locked in a high-rise room with his torn limb, there is nothing Woody can do to save himself, so it\u2019s up to spaceman Buzz Lightyear and Andy\u2019s other toys, including Rex the dinosaur, Hamm the pig, Mr. Potato Head and Slinky Dog, to mount a rescue expedition. They head first for the Toy Barn, where some Barbies come to delightful life and Buzz is astonished to find hundreds of exact replicas of himself on the shelves \u2014 one of whom throws a monkey wrench into the search for Woody by boxing Buzz up and taking his place on the team.\r Back in the building, the normally rambunctious Jessie begins tugging at Woody\u2019s heart \u2014 as well as that of the viewer \u2014 by pointing out that, unlike Woody, who has enjoyed many years with a loving owner, she has endured a long purgatory in storage, bereft of any life worth living.\r In the film\u2019s main and moving new song, \u201cWhen She Loved Me,\u201d penned by Randy Newman and sung by Sarah McLachlan, Jessie recalls how she once had an enchanted relationship with a girl, one that she thought could never end, but that after her owner outgrew her, she ended up, like so many other toys, in a donation box. It\u2019s the fate of all toys, she ruefully reflects, to outlive their usefulness, so the prospect of Japan for her at least means that she will provide pleasure again and have some purpose in life.\r Caught up short by this intimation of mortality, Woody suddenly finds himself conflicted, torn between the \u201cblood\u201d family of his old TV cohorts and his closest friends from Andy\u2019s house. Arrival of the rescue party puts his true loyalty to an immediate test, one complicated by Al\u2019s decision to leave at once for Japan. Dynamite action climax, which proceeds through a maze-like roller-coaster ride on airport baggage ramps, into the belly of a jet and out onto the landing gear during takeoff, deftly combines a modern setting with rousing cowboy heroics, while resolution of the main characters\u2019 fates has a sweetly philosophical ring that satisfies while still taking into account the darker issues raised earlier.\r Visually, \u201cToy Story 2\u201d is entirely of a piece with its predecessor, distinguished by the same endearing character design and reality-nudging peripheral details."

I could find nothing wrong with that. The script was just as irreverent and witty as the one in the first film, with jokes that adults will enjoy as well as kids. And the song When She Loved Me was beautiful and vital to the story.The voice talents are also faultless. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are brilliant here as Woody and Buzz, but they were equally brilliant in the first too. Wayne Knight was also fine as Al, who kidnaps Woody to sell him to a museum. Joan Cusack was great as Jessie, though I do agree she has been better. Frasier's Kelsey Grammar is resoundingly entertaining as Stinky Pete(what a great name!). Solid support also from Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, Jodi Benson(Ariel from little Mermaid)and Annie Potts.All in all, a fantastic film, that has enough visual jokes(like Wallace and Gromit) to satisfy adults and kids alike. Rock- solid entertainment that thoroughly deserves a 10/10. Bethany Cox"
