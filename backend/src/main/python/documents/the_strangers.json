But I think that this was a much more accurate example of what evil is. When they ask why are you doing this and the girl replies (\"because you were home\") That's one of the best and most accurate portrayal of what evil is."

The characters -- including the killers -- are cardboard, careless, not personable, not smart. Ultimately the movie ends up being about nothing. Just sadism for sadism's sake. Which is made worse by the fact that I never even felt anything for the doomed couple at the mercy of the masked knife-wielders. Liv Tyler's character is insulting to women. She was fey, fearful, senseless, useless, and probably deserved what she got in the end. The first-time director should certainly NOT be given another chance anytime soon. He needs a writing class, and he needs to learn how to work with actors. Waste of time, waste of money."

Finally, most bad horror movies make me laugh hysterically.

If you listen to a great singer singing about infanticide and incest with glee, are they judged on their singing ability? OR their content - lyrically and in content of character? the latter. End of story. Plenty of ppl can sing, and anyone can point a camera and say 'action'..... point is, can you produce something worthwhile, relevant, original? answer here = Nope. Thus the strangers takes a 'true story / real events\" premise and surmises, at great insult to all living relatives and the victims themselves, that the three masks found belonged to heartless, or black-hearted rather, sadistic murderers that like to psychologically torture their victims before they kill them hours later etc etc..... when there is no proof or reason for this WHATSOEVER.... Oh and could the two of you poosibly split up unnecessarily any more than you did in this clechefest? Um, sorry, but that is BS and represents the kind of heartless, insulting, sadistic behaviour literally, that they were ironically supposed to be commenting on within the movie figuratively.... How appalling and irresponsible. The likely scenario is that the 3 masks simply belonged to the three victims, that they were a love triangle or similar and something passionate and regrettable and tragic happened. So Bryan Bertino comes along and instead of making what he thought he had - some sort of sensational, original, ground-breaker like the Last House on the Left (also fairly unnecessary - and I say that as a horror afficionado who disagrees that torture porn and horror are interchangeable), Bryan has just insulted the dead, the living and anyone dumb enough to hand over cash for this pointless, self-obsessed, patronising, superfluous, waste of space, time and money. The absolutely epitome of style over substance, sprinkled in pointless sadism.... If I was a serial killer, I would masturbate in front of this film.... why not? Seems perfect...... A little bit of snuff for the masses eh Bryan? Shame on you f***ing idiots. You have damned a generation with your propoganda and BS. Have a frikkin' heart FGS - this movie achieves precisely NOTHING. Also many of the reviewers above are clearly not well-versed in horror, as the movie was predictable, crammed with cliche and an empty, vacuous exercise in the monotony of unceasing disrespect and cynicism..... NOT - \"invested brilliantly in silence\"... lol... that's the philosophical semantics of a frikkin' amateur. Change your profession or narrow your movie genres for review - you're not up to it sonny.... Time to move on chump."

It's a very simple home invasion movie with nothing really fancy or revolutionary about it, other than it being scary as hell. Throughout it's relatively short running time, this movie relies on ratcheting up the tension as we see shadows of faces and blurry masks in the darkness of the house until hitting well-executed jump scares, and the jump scares aren't cheap at all. Each one is well deserved because of the mounting suspense built up in the past few minutes. There's very little dialogue throughout the film, which allows minimal distractions when we're waiting to pee our pants in fear. I can't talk about this without mentioning some obvious flaws. The characters make some stupid decisions, and there are many points throughout the film where the invaders lead me to believe that they can teleport. Nevertheless, The Strangers is a very scary and thrilling little movie."

They are, but do they ever manage to tap into the realistic fears of the human mind. No. The Strangers does by taking the most simplistic (and realistic) fears of the human mind and combines them into a film that will most likely cause nightmares. A remote getaway, night hours, and three masked killers that our protagonists can never really get a grip on. The film has very brief moments of cliche's (For Example: The use of the film tactic \"One second there, the next second gone\") but can we fault them on that? Of course you can but should you? No film can be perfect, and The Strangers knows that, working with what it has handed to them. Some will hate the film, particularly It's choice of finale, which I was never to fond of myself, but accepted nonetheless. The Strangers is horrifying with the most simplistic elements, and that's what scares us most."

Although I did get scared 2 or 3 times earlier in the movie the plot sort of dried out after the first 45 minutes. Also in the end all the questions you are expecting to have answered slip through the cracks and no more is said about them. Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman are veterans who I would expect more from in a horror film but in the end they are just trying to play the stupid teenagers who all get killed in slasher movies. The Strangers is simply nothing special."
