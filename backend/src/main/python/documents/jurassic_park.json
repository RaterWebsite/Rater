I walked out a changed person, never to view movies the same way again.  The good ones... the truly special ones... aren't just something to watch.  They transport you to another world.  They take you away and cleanse you of the drudgery of reality.  They nestle into your memory and never leave.  Jurassic Park was the first film to affect me in this way and I'll never forget that feeling.  Much obliged, Mr. Spielberg!"

      "text": "Jurassic Park holds up surprisingly well to this day.  It may not be the deepest or best written movie ever made, but it's one of the most thrilling.  Spielberg is a master of creating tension and incredible set-pieces.  Most of the visual effects are still adequate, which is incredible for a movie made in 1993.  If a visual effects film holds up like that after 20 years there's a good chance it may never be completely antiquated.  The script can be somewhat clunky at times however.  It's not a bad script, just somewhat lacking when compared to something like The Truman Show or Inception.  It's still more than functional for a monster movie, and the main characters are thankfully likeable if somewhat needing of more complex characterization.  It's not perfect, but it's an extremely memorable and sometimes exhilarating action film that has deservedly gone down as a benchmark in movie history."

The dinosaurs are really amazing as the technology was not that developed when Jurassic Park came out. The actors are really good, especially the two kids and it has a lot of suspense. I thought it wouldn't have so much blood and violence as I thought it was a PG movie, but I don't have these kind of problems. Jurassic park is epic and haters gonna hate.

      "text": "On a small island off the coast of Costa Rica exists a most unusual animal preserve by the name of Jurassic Park. Operated by dinosaur lover John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), Jurassic Park is the first of its kind. Its population of creatures includes brachiosaurs, dilophosaurs, tricerotops, velociraptors, and a Tyrannosaurus Rex, each of which has been cloned using the latest technology that takes DNA from dinosaur-biting prehistoric insects preserved in amber, and uses that DNA for the re-creation. When the consortium funding Jurassic Park become concerned that all is not as it should be, Hammond is forced to call in three experts: paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), his partner, paleo-botanist Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), and the brilliant-but-cynical mathematician Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum). When the trio arrives at Jurassic Park, they are astonished by what it represents. It doesn't take long, however, for astonishment to turn to horror.\r First of all, for anyone who's wondering, given the current state of technology, the situation postulated in Jurassic Park cannot happen. Not only do the necessary cloning techniques not exist, but the likelihood of retrieving dinosaur DNA from an amber-encased prehistoric mosquito is extremely small. While insect specimens have been unearthed, for there to be dinosaur DNA, circumstances demand that the mosquito had bitten a dinosaur shortly before its fatal imprisonment, and the chance of that is slim, at best.\r Nevertheless, the enjoyment of any movie is hardly predicated by a factual premise. The apparent realism of some of Crichton's pseudo-science imbues Jurassic Park with a grounding that is acceptable in our high-tech world. After all, to weave a dinosaur fable in this day and age, it helps if science, not fantasy, is the driving force.\r Of course, the special effects help immensely. They are so good, in fact, and the dinosaurs look so real, that I half expected to see \"dinosaur trainer\" during the closing credits. Instead, however, plaudits go to the creators of Jurassic Park's primary screen presences (all apologies to the actors). Stan Winston, definitely no stranger to this sort of film (his recent credits include Aliens and Terminator 2), is credited with the live-action creatures. Dennis Muren gets his due for the full motion monsters. Phil Tippett is the \"dinosaur supervisor\" and Michael Lantieri presides over the creature effects. All-in-all, the wizards at ILM have done an outstanding job, giving us by far the most impressive and believable monster movie of all time. Nothing compares.\r Unfortunately, the story isn't the equal of its execution. To begin with, Crichton's book, while filled with fascinating ideas and entertaining moments, doesn't hold together as a top-of-the-line adventure story. The ending is especially problematic, resulting in a long-winded denouement that drags to an anticlimactic conclusion. Despite numerous small changes and omissions, the movie Jurassic Park is very much faithful to its printed inspiration. Perhaps Michael Crichton's involvement in the screenplay has something to do with this.\r The plot is little more than a cleverly jumbled-together batch of formulas. As I mentioned before, Jurassic Park is, reduced to its most basic level, a monster movie. Thrown in for good measure is the human interest story - the growing relationship between self-confessed child-hater Grant and his two youthful charges - but this part of the film works least successfully.\r Nevertheless, I doubt that there are many who will go to Jurassic Park for its characters or story. Rightly so, crowds will flock to the theaters screening this movie so they can ooh and aah, jump in their seats, and root for the overmatched humans against the big, bad dinosaurs. Even those familiar with the written work can't help being drawn in to the pulse-pounding exhilaration of the chase as the Tyrannosaurus menaces two powerless electric cars and the trapped humans inside. In the end, Jurassic Park succeeds because it's good entertainment."

      "text": "Jurassic Park\u201d will at least disabuse anyone of the idea that it would be fun to share the planet with dinosaurs. Steven Spielberg\u2019s scary and horrific thriller may be one-dimensional and even clunky in story and characterization, but it definitely delivers where it counts, in excitement, suspense and the stupendous realization of giant prehistoric reptiles. Having finally found another set of \u201cJaws\u201d worthy of the name, Spielberg and Universal have a monster hit on their hands.\r Very cleverly, the film positions itself both as a dark look at a theme park gone awry, and as a theme park itself. Merchandising, Universal tour attractions and sequels will extend the profits enormously. The only thing that will keep this properly PG-13-rated extravaganza from approaching rarefied \u201cStar Wars\u201d and \u201cE.T.\u201d B.O. heights is its inappropriateness for kids under 10 or 12 \u2014 it\u2019s just too intense, although many preteens will no doubt go anyway.\r The $ 60 million production (a bargain at the cost) follows the general idea if not the letter of Michael Crichton\u2019s 1990 bestseller, which was no doubt partly inspired by Conan Doyle\u2019s \u201cThe Lost World,\u201d the fanciful story of a remote land inhabited by otherwise extinct beasts.\r Basis of this hi-tech, scientifically based, up-to-date version lies in the notion that living, breathing and eating full-sized dinosaurs can be biologically engineered using fossilized dino DNA. Having accomplished this in secret on an island off Costa Rica, zillionaire entrepreneur/tycoon John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) brings in a small group of experts to view and, he hopes, endorse his miracle, which he intends to parlay into the world\u2019s most expensive zoo-cum-amusement park.\r Arriving to inspect the menagerie are paleontologists Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), as well as oddball mathematician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), advocate of the Chaos Theory, a sort of arithmetic equivalent of Murphy\u2019s Law. Also along for the look-see are Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero), a hard-nosed attorney repping the park\u2019s investors, and Hammond\u2019s two fresh-faced grandchildren, Lex (Ariana Richards) and Tim (Joseph Mazzello). Early introductory scenes are surprisingly perfunctory and even sloppy. There are several bad cuts unworthy of a filmmaker of Spielberg\u2019s skill, and the script wouldn\u2019t pass muster in Screenwriting 101. Curiously, the suspenseful structuring of the novel\u2019s opening chapters, in which characters are mysteriously bitten, is abandoned here in favor of some foreshadowing and cross-cutting a la \u201cThe Exorcist.\u201d\r Equally surprisingly, Spielberg lets the cat out of the bag as far as the dinosaurs are concerned very early, showing some of them in full view after only 20 minutes, lessening the suspense that could have been cranked way up through the accumulation of sounds and partial sightings.\r Still, none of these problems matter once the film clicks into high gear. When a storm strands two carloads of Hammond\u2019s guests in the middle of the park at night, a Tyrannosaurus Rex decides it\u2019s dinnertime. In a terrifically suspenseful and sustained sequence, the ferocious monster attacks the vehicles and its inhabitants, chowing down on one and terrorizing the others, particularly the children. Suddenly, after a fitful first hour, Spielberg pulls off one of the most exciting set pieces of his career, highlighted by a stunning shot of a T-Rex in a rearview mirror and climaxed by a gag lifted from Buster Keaton\u2019s \u201cSteamboat Bill Jr.\u201d\r Moving toward the climax, viewers will be reminded of \u201cAliens\u201d as two mid-sized Velociraptors attack through industrial ceilings and floors, and play a suspenseful cat-and-mouse game with the kids in a huge kitchen. Final action scene is ironically played out as three monsters attack in a display room festooned with mounted dinosaur skeletons, which will give kids occasion to decide whether they prefer their dinosaurs alive or dead.\rIt was unimaginable that Spielberg would proceed with \u201cJurassic Park\u201d if he wasn\u2019t certain that his dinosaurs would be the best ever seen onscreen, and the result shows that assumption to be true.\r The monsters are far more convincing than the human characters. Just about everyone is defined by one trait only \u2014 Dr. Grant dislikes children, Ellie is good-natured, Ian is the sardonic skeptic, Dennis is the sweaty traitor and Samuel L. Jackson\u2019s computer technician always has a cigarette in his mouth.\r Technically, the film is sometimes more than it needs to be. As in some of Spielberg\u2019s previous outings, Dean Cundey\u2019s lensing overdoes the back illumination and shafts of light at times, and John Williams\u2019 score gets unnecessarily bombastic. But the dinosaurs rule here, and Spielberg and his team of special effects aces have put something on the screen that people have never seen before, which is the surest way to create a blockbuster."

Spielberg does sentimental family films like no other, and Michael Crichton's ideas from the book the film is based on add a little extra intrigue to the story. Most of the cast are serviceable rather than outstanding, and the characters aren't the most interesting or original ever committed to film, though Laura Dern still impresses. The real stars of the show (as they should be) are the dinosaurs, proof that a combination of CGI and animatronics result in effects that age the least noticeably over time (the film is nearly 20 years old and the special effects are only just starting to look out of date). The set pieces are also fantastic, particularly the T-Rex reveal and the now infamous Velociraptor kitchen scene. Jurassic Park benefits in a real way from the dream-team combination of Spielberg's expert direction, Stan Winston's creature effects and John Williams' masterful score (easily among the finest he has ever composed), consequently the film is finely crafted and truly memorable. Scored purely on its value as a film, Jurassic Park probably deserves an 8, but since it's the most important film of my childhood, I'm prepared to bump it up to a 9."

      "text": "Jurassic Park is surprisingly good, and I say \"surprisingly,\" because I didn't know how much more I really wanted to watch after the first hour. Roughly the first 60 minutes is contaminated with utter boredom. In fact, most of this first hour wasn't even necessary. If I could crop out the 5-10 minutes of the first hour that were important, I imagine that the audience would still understand what was happening. Maybe it was just my inner-boy speaking, but I wanted to see some dinosaurs for cryin' out loud! But I digress. (To the film's credit, though, we do see some dinos before they begin their reign of terror, but most are in the background, one we only get a glimpse of his claw and eye. Only one dino is fully exposed, and it doesn't really do anything. And before the dinos start attacking, we see two more; a baby, as well as a sick triceratops). After you get past the first hour, the film quickly picks up. I won't say how many, but people do die (and we see two dismembered body parts before the film is over). To be honest, I've never seen a film that would truly qualify as \"scary,\" but this certainly \"freaked me out.\" I always thought dinos were terrifying creatures, but now that fear has been greatly multiplied. In addition to an excellent job on making the dinos appear so suddenly (you'll probably be startled by an un-expected reptile at least once), the dinos look incredibly real, despite the fact that this film is nearly 20 years old. The characters in the film weren't quite one-dimensional, but they weren't very fleshed out either. The plot was slightly outrageous, but if you can force yourself to believe it, the film is much more enjoyable. The score by legendary composer, John Williams, was something of a disappointment. This is by far the worst I've heard from him, though it's not that bad. It's serviceable, and sometimes, that's all one can ask for. Though there are times when the music is a little irritating and repetitive. The film is lots of fun, and it's truly scary. There are some comedy elements, but it's mostly for the fright and joy of seeing people chased by dinos. So, if that's what you came for, you won't be disappointed. That is, if you can get past that first hour."

The terror and thrills are also ever present and really add an extra level of excitement to this one as you watch these huge beasts attack these people with childlike wonder. However, once you get snapped out of that childlike wonder, there are some issues, namely the acting. Laura Dern sucks here. The kids are not stellar. Then Richard Attenborough (RIP) is nothing more than alright. Luckily, Jeff Goldblum, Sam Neill, and Wayne Knight, are all fine, which is a plus. However, the acting of Dern is the true cause of much of my distress, as she was just straight up bad. There are also some cheesy scenes that really detract from the overall product.

It has an exciting plot, great performances, and action to support it. The effects were amazing; ahead of its time. The Dinosaurs looked incredibly, and terrifyingly realistic."

      "text": "Few movies have ever managed to captivate me the way this one did. I watched it on opening night when it first came out in theatres. Then about a dozen more times after that. I bought the VHS, DVD, Blu Ray, book, sound track, trading cards, stickers, posters, even had a Jurassic Park tie at one point. So yeah, I'm a huge fan.\r When it first came out, it was a visual marvel. Today the CG sequences do show their age, but luckily most of the practical effects still hold up, a testimony to why animatronics is still valid.\r Great story, it does deviate a bit from the book but not too much. Interesting characters, but the dialogue now does feel a little hammy at time.\r Overall:\rJurassic Park is one of my favourite movies from my childhood. While it is a little dated now, it still holds up remarkably well, considering its age."
