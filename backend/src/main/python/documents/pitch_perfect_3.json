Pros: The actors (or the actresses I should say) have an absolute blast with this film. The humor is much better this time round than Pitch Perfect 2. There are many ad-libs and ridiculous scenes that are silly/stupid, but very amusing. While there are not a lot of sining performances, the movie still features great toe-tapping musical numbers.Overall consensus: Better than the critics suggest! I would rank this about equal to the second film, as the story falters but the cast really shines. Much more stupid/silly humor than prior installments-- but for the most part-- it really works."

      "text": "i love cheap thrills.. Pitch Perfect 3Some flawed tracks and repetitive sub-plotted characters pretty much gives away with in the first 10 minutes of the movie that it is not in good hands. Pitch Perfect 3 works off brilliantly in a semi-comic movie sense where every character is pointing out the plot-holes in order to be funny which works but it sets off the wrong tone considering the previous installments which were based on smart comedy. Rebel Wilson; at the end, is the star of the show as she helps the audience in reaching the climax which is a big disappointment."

      "text": "Fans of the previous films will welcome the old gang, as they hit Europe for songs and thin plots. Every character gets a few quick story beats with Anna Kendrick as the leader. But Rebel Wilson's comic style carries more of the weight (pun intended). The commentators (John Michael Higgins & Elizabeth Banks) are following them around to make a documentary, but their comments seem more mean that funny. The Bellas sing their lite pop tunes all over the place with a few numbers getting some staging, but none of it is very elaborate. Even though this sequel isn't original in any way, there's still full of youthful energy and spunky fun ."

This is a movie girls see with their gals whether they are 12 or 22. It's immediately harder to get in touch with your own \"pitches\" when everyone is on holiday. I was lucky that my friend was in town but for every other movie, I saw it in a large group and saw this one with just one very good friend of mine. The reason seeing it with a group was even more critical is this movie's core theme really is sisterhood. I don't know if it executed was that well executed but it was there. You know what you're getting with these movies. If you liked the other two, you'll like this. It's probably the least like the other movies in that it changes plot in the middle but it always has the same tone. There are awkward jokes, jokes based on stereotypes, and then the funny jokes. I think the second one is the funniest but the third is the least offensive."

      "text": "Pitch Perfect 3 is unfortunately the worst part of the trilogy. Little work has been put into the Acapella performances in terms of singing and choreography. The sloppy script leaves the impression that Universal Pictures didn't care about giving Pitch Perfect a worthy ending but rather planned to make as much money with the smallest amount of effort possible. Even though some parts are heartwarming and funny, PP3 suffers from bad dramaturgy and a often dumb and implausible plot. A real rivaling A capella group was substituted by the spineless, unthreatening girlband \"Evermoist\" (thumbs up for the creative name though), leaving The Barden Bellas in no danger whatsoever. After an abrupt, unsatisfying ending I found myself asking what it's all been for. I am huge fan of the first two films. This one is a let-down."

Only when they finally recognize their own franchise is going down the drain very quickly because Pitch Perfect 3 is a great example of this situation.

      "text": "The Bellas are back! To me these movies have always been about friendship, family, and finding your place in the world. The first Pitch Perfect showed the characters coming together to form an unbreakable bond. The second forced them to deal with going their separate ways. The third... really doesn't have anything like that. Each Bella has already begun carving their way through life. While not entirely happy, they're functioning after college. However, they do miss each other. So with no new emotional ground to cover Pitch Perfect 3 just says to heck with it and reunites everyone for fun. While decidedly less heartfelt this final show is worth watching. The series' tongue is just as sharp as ever.The musical performances are still delightful. Trish Sie's direction is light, poppy, and fun. Every character's personality comes together to bring a wide variety of laughs. While everyone was able to return for the final outing, the key players are still here. The newcomers fit right in. The plot takes something of a hit. The whole competition aspect isn't as exciting as before and the new foes aren't as memorable as those who came before even with the likes of Ruby Rose leading the opposition. There's also a somewhat ill-advised turn towards an action movie in the final act, complete with an explosion. As dumb as it was to watch Fat Amy kicking crap out of armed guards, we do get an absolutely stunning rendition of Britney Spear's \"Toxic\" as compensation.All in all it's probably the weakest of what is now my new favorite film trilogy, but it's just so good to be reunited with the girls one last time. I grew to love these characters over the course of the last two movies and will miss them fiercely. In a lot of ways they're my family too. So despite being sad that my time with The Bellas has come to an end, I'm happy because their last performance didn't disappoint. Okay, I better end this review before I start crying. It's the last call, pitches. Don't miss it."

It is very rarely funny (in comparison to the first two's many many extremely laughable parts and jokes) and the plotline is very inconsistent and lazy, it hardly feels like there's a plot at all (the screenplay feels like it was written in two hours: just bring in Fat Patricia's evil father and let the Bellas go on a Spy mission, et voil\u00e0!). The focus shifts from the great musical performances and the very funny and simple jokes that made the first two feature films sparkle, to cheap laughs and disoriented musical numbers. Sadly, \"Pitch Perfect 3\" is a strong example of how a sequel can go horribly wrong, seeing it ends the trilogy on such a disappointing, low point."

The movie features all the great characters from the first 2 installments and shares similar humor and jokes.However, this one felt very different from the others in a good way. It was shorter and faster and jokes didn't get repeated all the time like in the first two.The movie is mainly about Fat Amy, Beca, Chloe and Aubrey. And I think most viewers can agree that Fat Amy really was the star in this one with all her incredibly funny stunts. However, the one-liners from characters like Lilly/Esther(!), Flo, Stacie and Cynthia are missing.TL;DR: The movie is a great closure for the franchise. The movie goes quick and fast but in this case, that's a good thing."

The plot is ridiculous, the jokes often are crude, but the singing and choreography were energetic and polished.  I saw the sequel first in a movie theater and the original on the computer a few days later.  My original purpose for watching the movies was to learn more about the a cappella pop singing phenomenon that seemed to be sweeping through middle schools, high schools, and colleges.  (I'm a classically trained choral conductor.)  I can't say I learned a huge amount about the creative process that underlies the arranging of pop songs--especially the mash-ups--but I was very entertained by the movies.  Pitch Perfect apparently is going to be the last of the sequels, and it was a worthy finale to the trilogy."

As much as I don't like that word it really was awkward and some sub plots where totally useless and did not fit. The humor was terrible and was very poorly executed. The actors did a good job, at least 2-3 of them. But the rest, they acted just as terrific as their characters. The directing style was poorly executed as well. But the things I mentioned at the beginning are the only things that stands out and help make this movie what it is. The sound effects where amazing to, but that was really expected from them give the fact that it is a musical video. Overall this is an above average movie which could have been a lot better if it was cared a bit more and developed more the characters depth and the plot complexity."

I think it had really good music and that helped not lose as much interest in the movie. The songs were popular and had you singing along."

Oh, Bellas, you had so much promise.  But there are so many things about this trio of films I absolutely hated --- from the gratuitous vomit scenes early in the franchise to the awkward sexual jokes and Chloe singing every part from soprano to bass!!!????!!! and this third installment doesn't make any of the shortcomings any better.   From the very beginning, it feels forced -- yeah, they ALL quit their jobs and take off on a moments notice to do a USO tour that Aubrey's dad (isn't that convenient) gets them under contract to do.  The \"riff off\" in the hanger is an embarrassment...these girls clearly have no idea how real musicians behave and having Gail and whatshisname doing a \"documentary\" makes no sense.  It's all forced.  There are some sparkling moments...and Fat Amy really is the anchor that ties them all together, but, in general, the script lacks direction and tries to be too many things (i.e. the daddy/daughter storylines, the forced romances, the action/suspense/kidnapping scenes..etc.).   It just flounders and moves awkwardly from scene to scene.  Of course Becca is a \"genius\" and gets discovered and \"wins\" but of course she pulls her girls -- totally unrehearsed on stage for an amazing performance.  Riiiiiiight.  It could have been brilliant ---but I'm glad is Aca-over."

With that said, there is somehow still narrowly enough there to stop it becoming bad - just. The shorter run time helps, while the musical numbers are a step up on 'Pitch Perfect 2' in my opinion; the Toxic end is fun.Anna Kendrick (Beca) and Rebel Wilson (Fat Amy) remain the pick of the onscreen talent. None of the other regulars stand out, nor do any of the newcomers - though it's always cool to see John Lithgow (Fergus), albeit with a dodgy accent, while 'Timeless' star Matt Lanter (Chicago) also appears.The plot is very lame, yet I honestly didn't dislike it - almost, but not quite."
