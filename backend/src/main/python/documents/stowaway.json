The cast is good, the set is great, the CGI is compenent, but those are the three points i'm giving it. Unfortunately, it doesn't work at all, because the premise is completely demented, and the movie gets a lot wrong about how space programs work. The filmmakers consulted Scott Manley to get the physics/space right, but it doesn't really seem they listened. Right from the beginning of the movie tears of cringe will fill the eyes of everyone who's at least a littlebit interested in the space programs/physics. One has to wonder how much worse would it be without Scott's input. The whole premise is completely ridiculous. Without anyone realizing, some dude gets stuck behind a SCREWED IN(!!!!) panel of a rocket, and the crew finds him only after they're already on a way to Mars. They can't get back to Earth, their CO2 scrubber dies, and they don't have enough oxygen either. The rest of the movie is KINDA about the morality of one vs four, and KINDA about trying to come up with a plan to save the stowaway/rest of the crew. The main problem is, that the movie doesn't respect the genre. Either you can have a SF movie with nonsensical macguffins, or you can have hard-SF with plausible or semi-plausible technology. Stowaway tries to do the latter, it's near future, more or less existing technology. Yet the technology spectacularly fails (and there are no backup systems), only as a result of the demented plot, and the characters have to mount a nonsensical rescue mission. The whole movie i wanted to shout at the screen \"IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT\" or \"APOLLO 13 CREW COULD IMPROVISE CO2 SCRUBBERS AND THAT WAS 1970\". The characters are super 2D, certain actions of theirs come out of nowhere, the whole thing is just coming apart at the seams. I really, really didn't like it.

Unfortunately, writer-director Joe Penna's space-based, molasses-paced morality play is a tirelessly tedious slog padded with lots of filler and more than a few incredibly dull sequences.

Seriously?A spacewalk , to retrieve an oxygen cylinder, where the astronauts are over exerting themselves on an ascent because of gravity effects...in space. Then in the next scene, gliding along the anchor wire, but this time completely free hand and no safety rope or wire. And then returning with a life saving oxygen tank in hand, which by the way is not secured to any part of her body or suite, only to be lost anyway because she could not brake on descent.

Okay, maybe it's a bit implausible that Michael would get stuck inside the bulkhead, but we viewed that along the same lines as when the wrong limb gets amputated, or a cloth is left inside a patient's skull.But, for example, the algae farm didn't look very impressive on the ship because he had very limited space and resources with which to cultivate it. On Mars this would have turned into a much more expansive (and likely much more successful) experiment. And, I believe they couldn't scrub the mission and head back because they were already traveling at many thousands of miles per hour and had exhausted all of their fuel getting up to that speed and initiating the gravity-simulating pinwheel. The fuel for their return trip was waiting for them on Mars, but there was no slowing down and then accelerating back up to speed to get back to Earth.Yes, they probably should have had a backup Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly on board. They did have a couple of canister-style assemblies but as mentioned those would not stand up to a 2 year journey. They were on a very tight budget -- this is mentioned several times, when they decide to continue the burn even though the rocket is underperforming (due to Michael's unaccounted for weight), the fact that the capsule was really designed for two but they had pushed it to three, the bit about how they removed some of the shielding layering, etc. I think having a redundant CDRA was seen as extra weight and expense that didn't make bean-counter sense given that these things have a high reliability and usually there's not a man stuck up there who then falls out of the ceiling.Beyond that, we thought this was a perfect Netflix slow-burn. Not really appropriate for a theater, but we were fairly riveted throughout. We thought the ending was satisfying as well. Not an uplifting film, but one that explores how difficult space travel is actually going to be in real life (my opinion is we probably need to populate Mars with autonomous AI and robots for decades before we send any squishy humans out there, and that shouldn't even happen until we have a very good grasp on how to genetically engineer said squishy humans to be better suited to both the journey and the stay on an alien planet). The idea that \"nothing happens\" is kind of absurd. Plenty happens. Two more things:  1) we appreciated that for the most part all four of these people acted throughout like MATURE ADULTS. There was little to no infantile Young Adult angst and bickering, and the reactions felt authentic to what trained professional adults would exhibit in this situation.

It's about everything astronauts and explorers are willing to sacrifice to take on these missions. In that endeavor, this movie exceeds expectations.

Eventually it ends up being boring, and then the stowaway is found and there is a bunch of nothing happens. Then the whole scientific part is thrown away with inconsistencies and illogical stuff. The ship has several compartments, maybe 5 or 6 , but the CO2 scrubber is built into only one and there are no backups. You'd think NASA or whatever the space agency would have learned already from Apollo 13 to always have backups on board of life sustaining , which is oxygen/water/food/temperature.  The other big no is, ship is built for 2 but they \"squeezed in 3\".  It's the other way. If there are 3, then the ship is usually built for at least 4 or 5. Always extra room for error, especially air/water/food. Especially for a space mission that lasts 2 YEARS (for crying out loud).  So, I'm watching this and I am aware of these issues already - as these problems reveal themselves not until the mid-way into the movie.  The person behind a wall panel is just completely unrealistic, so while I already given up watching this a real-life scientific movie, the movie turns more illogical to a point, when I am just hoping, that this must be just some nightmare of one of the crews and soon he or she will wake up, this can't be real. Then I'm hoping the stowaway person has either ulterior motives or he isn't what he makes him out to be, just to see some sort of a twist or turn from measuring mushroom growth of the botanic guy. But no. And then the ending. If I wasn't already depressed /bored enough already , the doctor goes on a suicide mission during a solar storm to bring 1 tank of oxygen from the mid section of the ship, suspended on the other end of the whole spinning assembly. Just a reminder:  The oxygen is still not enough. They supposed to have 2 brought back for all of them to live, so the suicide mission only produces only one, so there is still someone else who needs to die.

I would expect such big missions would monitor even the slightest deviations from predicted parameters. Other than this, I found it interesting, although nothing special or fresh. Since I did not watch any trailer or spoilers, I had no idea where this was heading. It seemed liked Michael fit it rather well too quickly, so I thought he would turn out to be some lunatic, but no... so the movie did manage to divert my expectations, which I guess is good. I did enjoy acting: all four were really good. Collette and Kendrick rarely disappoint me, Kim I only know from Lost where I just loved him and same here.

As the story progresses, there are some contrivances which don't help the already slight story feel more real, but the director and actors still manage to squeeze some believable drama out of the proceedings.The acting is quite good -- I was surprised by the casting of Kendrick, but she did great -- and it's what makes the movie worth watching.

We need to support this industry as they have continued to provide entertainment for us even at home. Anyway, enough altruism for this post. This week we were able to watch the new release, Stowaway, which was released on Netflix on April 22nd. This streaming film is about an important mission to Mars with a 3-person crew but as usual, of course, space giveth and space taketh away. The crew faces an unlikely and impossible decision of what to do with an unplanned stowaway *wink wink* aboard the spaceship that is putting everyone and the mission in jeopardy. Let's see how this flick turns out.First things first, the cast is really just 4 people. I mean there's not even a fake voice in the background that gets a basic name in the rolling credits. The writing in the movie works at times. I'm not sure if it was the actors or the writing that worked, but the the storyline is interesting enough to pique a viewer's interest. Between my girl, Toni Collette, and Daniel Dae Kim, I felt their performances. And let me just put this out there... no one believes that Anna Kendrick would be in space. The movie is just downhill from there. Kendrick isn't bad in the movie but how do you not look at her and think, \"is this pitch perfect in space?\" Kendrick hits some lines and scenes very well, but I just couldn't get passed her being whiny in space. The 4th cast member, Shamier Anderson, is barely even used. I think when people view this you're going to expect a lot more interaction and action between the only people in the movie and it just doesn't happen. You're left thinking in most scenes like, \"is that it? That's all you're going to do (or say)?!\" You're feeling a bit empty and that's kind of exactly how I felt about the space environment as well. Empty! We're used to these grandiose space settings like Gravity, Interstellar and others but here space is an afterthought. Yes, we're going to Mars and yes were spinning and it makes us sick but the views are forgettable. You could've almost set this movie on a deserted island or shipwreck and it would be the same movie. It was just disappointing to not really take advantage of the coolest part of the movie - space.With that said, Stowaway has the makings of an entertaining thriller but that's not what we got. A movie dependent on a 4-person cast needs a lot of help otherwise to be memorable. Space movies generally garner a lot of intrigue, impressiveness and beauty in the views but this movie finds a way to make the great beyond even look humdrum.
