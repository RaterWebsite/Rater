The inevitable happens, but not before they spend every major celebration trying to dismiss their mutual attraction. This film is so predictable that it needs clever dialogue or entertaining characters to make it rise above. In this case, there\u2019s a TOUCH of both, esp. Kristin Chenoweth in her fun role. The leads are both adequate but never special. Anyone who\u2019s mildly cynical will find the film full of relatively tiresome tropes, but there\u2019s hope for the shamelessly romantic."

Everything seemed like they took bad jokes, bad script and scrambled it up hoping it will make an ok movie. AS USUAL ON NETFLIX or more like NOFIXNET? crappy quality and abusing the name brand to justify low quality movies.. in my opinion Netflix is the worst movie streaming platform to ever exist"

Disbelief that people actually would give this a positive review.  Disbelief that an entire movie can go without one genuine realistic (or funny) moment.  Disbelief that they would spoon-feed toilet humour to Emma Roberts's fan base.  If any movie deserved a negative rating, it's this embarrassing mess."

Throughout the movie our two characters 'date' over holidays and gradually develop feelings for one another though not properly conveying this or having a serious conversation about it. Overall I feel the performances given were sincere and sweet and I enjoyed this movie more than others of the genre I've seen. It's a goofy movie and definitely worth a watch."
