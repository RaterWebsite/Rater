Because it is a film that knows where it is going, it takes another path and prevents the saga from being too repetitive. Because Halloween isn\u2019t just about a serial killer. Halloween connects a party with candy, you can put anything, like different monsters, and it will always be Halloween. And why smash the movie just for the masked killer\u2019s absence. It looks like you\u2019re not watching the whole movie. All that bothers you is his absence, think about the staging, if on the level of suspense it is effective etc. I found the film ultra entertaining, because I\u2019m carried away in this mysterious investigation and makes me want to see what happens next. And the film has a lot of suspense and the atmosphere is heavy.The atmosphere is successful thanks to his music that perfectly ambianced, not to mention the excellent theme, an abstract theme composed by John Carpenter and Alan Howarth.Well, the movie\u2019s as **** up about some things as well. We can also take example on the scene of the hospital where the guy in the car was hyper badly camouflaged and was hyper burned at the first viewing. But fortunately Halloween III does not take the obvious flaws and this saves the film rather well."

When I think of Halloween (the holiday) I think of children wearing the masks from this film and that incredible, indelible, iconic shot of trick r' treaters silhouetted against the sunken sun, the sky orange going on black, looking out over the low lights of Phoenix from the hills above. Damn that's nice. Oh and that insanely catchy Silver Shamrock song. So much memorable from such a strange, casually plot irrelevant movie. It doesn't really do one thing exceptionally well - besides presentation. The plot is fine, silly verging on nonsensical. The blood and gore are mostly pedestrian but with glimmers of imagination (if only the family murder scene didn't devolve into snake bites). The main characters are likable ciphers - there are a few insights into them but it's mostly matter of fact without much more than a passing interest. Without a better way to put it and hating this turn of phrase - they don't make them like this anymore, whatever the hell that means."

      "text": "I distinctly remember being in Grade 8 when the film came out, and for four major reasons: 1) The excellent TV commercial, with John Carpenter's spooky music and the spider crawling out of the mouth of the mask; 2) The decent book adaptation written for young adults, that I read at the time, and thoroughly enjoyed; 3) Karen Carpenter died of a heart attack from anorexia nervosa; and 4) Major songs on the radio around that time were 'Centerfold' by The J. Geils Band and 'Bette Davis Eyes' by Kim Carnes. Though I had not yet seen the previous two films and wasn't old enough (the R-rating, and my parents were somewhat strict about that kind of thing), I really wanted to see it, but over the years, I never really got around to it, until recently I found used the entire 'Halloween' franchise on a 10-blu ray pack, and no longer have any sort of excuse, really.\r I loved Wallace's work in 'Stephen King's It' (except for the last half-hour, but that's probably the book's fault and not the director's) and I thought his 'Vampires: Los Muertos' was rather underrated, so an added attraction for me was to watch his directorial debut here. He impressed me. I enjoyed the film and all of the extras on its blu ray very much. If you like horror films at all, you should watch this.\r Protagonists Tom Atkins and Stacey Nelkin are very good here, and I liked Dan O'Herlihy even better than when I had previously seen him in 'The Virgin Queen', 'Imitation of Life', 'The Cabinet of Caligari', 'Good Against Evil' and the first two 'RoboCop' films, and, as always, Dean Cundey provides excellent cinematographical work and the soundtrack by Carpenter and Alan Hogarth is dependably solid. Don't bother with the negative reviews that came out at the time the film was released: Most people were upset that the film didn't have Michael Myers in it, and didn't give it a chance. Find out for yourself--in my humble opinion, it's worth both purchasing and at least a rewatch."

As a standalone film it's very efficient though the story is quite ridiculous, but executed quite well due the atmosphere and ominous visuals. Honestly i have to give this and film credit to breakaway from the normal formula and really go for an insane concept. One of the best soundtracks of all time once again from Carpenter and more unbelievable cinematography from Dean Cundy."

      "text": "Congratulations, Halloween franchise. You tried. Yes, you failed. But you tried. ..Good : I know a lot of people hate this movie to death, and I do understand why. I hate this movie too. Just not as much as the others do. There are some good things I need to address about this film. The first one would obviously be the fact that it dared to take a totally different direction and give a totally different story idea. That didn't (or doesn't) work. But that's a different thing. At least it dared to completely neglect the first two films, for its own good. Had it been successful, we might have got a totally different Halloween franchise. Who knows? Also, I think the ideas used in this film are not bad, either. I dig the ideas behind it. I always loved fantasy and witchcraft with adventures that have something to do with the ones following some sort of a cult kind of a thing, or some fictional ancient history, if they're not cheesy as hell. That's the reason I love a number of Disney fantasy films and a lot of these type of horror films. Tom Atkins does a fine job in his part. His doctor character doesn't compare to Dr. Loomis from the first two, but is kind of entertaining at what he does - though, his character is one of the biggest flaws of the movie. Dan O'Herlihy does a fine job as Cochran. I haven't seen his other films, but I am positive that the other performances by him are better - as much as I have heard about him. He has a feeling of presence in the movie and gives many creeps. The way they open up the story as the movie progresses is appreciable. Also, the intense scenes do deliver. The entire film may not be well directed, but certain parts are. The music that plays for the Halloween commercial felt really disturbing to me. It was a mere rehash and pacman-ed version of \"Mary had a little lamb\" but hits the nerves where it should. It spooked the hell out of me, honestly. ..Bad : There are a lot of many bad things in this movie. The first one would be the tonal inconsistency. And, that's mainly due to the characterization of Dr. Challis. He is well acted, no doubt. But, he is out there to investigate something, and ends up having sex with someone at the most awkward time. He is kind of a womanizer and also kind of a generic hero at the same time. That doesn't mesh very well. So, from a mystery-fantasy movie, we divert to sex comedy very often. He tries to get in the pants of many ladies in this film. And all of it is just because we need some sex scenes. Completely unfit for a movie like this. This is one of the main reasons I hate this movie. Then, there are some sci-fi elements to it, which feels like a cheap and rejected idea for Blade Runner. Except for saying that it is \"advanced ancient technology\", it does nothing to explain the **** We just need to accept something that doesn't even feel remotely possible as a fact. And those type of things are the things I hate the most in a **** sci-fi movie. I don't even think that Blade Runner is a movie that will ever resemble reality. But, it is well put over and superbly directed. The ideas definitely win the viewers over. But this piece of **** uses the sci-fi **** merely as a plot device. You can use any fantasy element in the way you like, if you can give us a good product. But sci-fi means a little more of convincing stuff than just blant fanstasy. Every good sci-fi film has some degree of acceptability of the ideas put in it, even though it may never be realized at all. This movie completely misses that point. ..Conclusion : On the whole this movie is a frustrating movie. Some good ideas and the totally different direction it takes is appreciable. But, in the end, it is just a mystery-fantasy wannabe which is simply a tonally inconsistent and whacky sci-fi movie. ..Rating. ..Score : 5.1/10Grade: D+"

The children are killed by a chip inside of their masks that activate when they watch the Silver Shamrock Commercial!? Are you serious? It looks so dumb on the camera!  What happened to the escalating moments of terror that John Carpenter gave us in Halloween? Or moments of gore that Rick Rosenthal gave us in Halloween II? Both movies brilliantly showed us the true brutality of Michael Myers\u2019 nature. This movie was just laughable mess from start to finish.

      "text": "As soon as a strange man, seller of masks for halloween, end up in a gas station, saying that people will kill all of them he is sent to a hospital a few days before halloween, in the same night he got brutally murdered by a strange and mysterious man and no one knows the possibly reason for it. So his daughter, Ellie Grimbridge, and the doctor who attended the man, Daniel Challis, go investigate the last steps of the seller and try to find out what could have happened to lead into that. Directed and written by Tommy Lee Wallace.This movie creates a mystery since the very beginning, with a nice persecution sequence at the very beginning, where you don't understand much what is going on, but later on the movie it got pretty clear what could have happened. I think that the hospital scenes wasn't much well applied, like the man could surely speak, he was just repeating the sentence \"they will kill all of us\" or something like that, there are moments that people got shocked and say only one thing, but i didn't got convenced that he couldn't have said more, or at least showed the mask more clearly to the people there or something like this. I believe that they could have placed some dialogues where they did explained why not call the police or something, or at least put the cops somewhere in this film, a mysterious and brutal murder have happened in a hospital and not even a comment about cops, that felt like a flaw for me. A thing that i really enjoyed in the script here, was that strange and fully of secrets in that small town that they went, the whole atmosphere in that place was strange, people looking, cameras watching everything, weird people, you could just feel that things wasn't going well around there. The development of the plot durint the second act in the small town, together with the some other details, i think that it is satisfactory, it goes calmily and little by a little we got know more about what is going on there, who is living there, what business happens, that wasn't anything great at a point to make you care much about anyone, but, for me, it was decent. Toward the end things got almost 100% off, in a point that can screw things up, i don't really mind strange things, i like the incomprehensible, really enjoy to think about it, but there is somethings that isn't really here, it got ridiculous, like a mask become into a bunch of snakes and flies with worms, sorry, but that is way to overly unreal and nonsense, durint the escape from the factory, things got way to dumb with some really weak writing decisions, since the mask throw, and that completely nonsense part where Challis put down those brooches and suddenly all the robots got destroyed, even those that weren't hitted by the symbols, except for one, the Ellie one, wich doesn't make any sense, first she being a robot and actually help Challis to escape from there and not giving away his position in any way, and later on she tries to kill him just for the sake of it, there was no necessity for she to be a damn robot and narratively didn't really made much sense, but it was kind of nice the battle in the end, it makes sense, no, but it was a bit fun. And also the part before that all, where Challis apparentely knows exactly how to turn on all of these computers and put the commercial there in all the screens, thing that he have saw it before, but it wasn't in that proportion.The story remembers from Halloween 2 the mmystic aspect that was added, using the same name as before used, i'm not sure if this is really cannon with the others, in virtude that nothing except for this is mentioned and that they used the same actress from before to play other character in here, but i would say that it is.This movie is definely not a horror movie, even that it tries to be sometimes, you don't feel fear watching this, it tries to be a slasher, in sometimes it does work, the kills aren't very creative, but are definely distressing. It also tries to be a investigation movie, wich worked.Stacey Nelkin didn't made me buy that she was sad or affeard of something in much moments, she was functional, during romance moments she also was ok with her lines, she mostly spoke with not much emotion, but as i said, she was functional. Tom Atkins pretty much plays the hero in here, he does convince as a doctor, he could make me believe that he wanted to help in some moments, he also was very functional. Dan O'Herlihy is in here, and he is definely fun, the way that he speaks is nice, he have that malice where he is doing something good, but behind that all it have something hidden, he have some good sarcastic moments. Nancy Kyes that played Annie in the first Halloween movie is here, but to play Linda, Daniel's Ex-wife, she is here more as a homage to the original movie i think, if this is cannon thre was no reason to put her in here except for this, she don't have much lines, but she convinced me in what she did."

Season of the Witch at least has some originality, which the other entries in the series lacked. It's a underrated film in general with a grown cult following. Like most 80's horror films, definitely a guilty pleasure, but really it's really not as bad as you'd think. Just don't treat it as a proper \"Halloween\" movie as that it is not. However, the influences of John Carpenter & Debra Hill had on HIII give the film that classic Halloween 1 and 2 vibe that other entries in the series lacked. Season of the Witch is a underrated film.

      "text": "John Carpenter's 1978 'Halloween' is wholly deserving of its status as a horror classic. To this day it's still one of the freakiest films personally seen and introduced the world to one of horror's most iconic villainous characters Michael Myers.Which is why it is such a shame that not only are all of the sequels nowhere near as good but that the decline in quality is so drastic. Ok, the original 'Halloween' is very difficult to follow on from, but most of the sequels could at least looked like effort was made into them. 'Halloween III: Season of the Witch' had a generally negative critical reception and is still considered by many one of the worst of the series, but has garnered fans overtime. To me, 'Halloween III: Season of the Witch' is not that awful, but it is not a particularly good film either.It is often criticised for straying too far from the formula and not feeling at all like a 'Halloween' film. Actually these complaints are understandable, but a lot of people have also argued that there is much more wrong than just being unrecognisable as a 'Halloween' film. Actually, didn't mind at all that it tried to be different rather than being a retread like 'Halloween II' was, sadly it just didn't work out. Judging it as a standalone, 'Halloween III' also manages still to be problematic.'Halloween III' is not a complete mess. It is one of the better-looking and more polished sequels and has a suitably eerie look. The music has a spine-chilling atmosphere and has a real eeriness. The song is similarly very catchy.A couple of the deaths are disturbing and Dan O'Herlihy tries his best.Like the previous film, the drawbacks are numerous and significant. There is more creepiness than with 'Halloween II', even if just sporadically, but tonally it still doesn't feel right. The weirdness of the story is overkill and parts are unintentionally funny. The science fiction elements feature excessively and confuse the storytelling, as well as because it is more silly than eerie it dumbs it down.Once again there is very little scary or suspenseful. A couple of the deaths are more disturbing but most are not that creative or unsettling. The story was a decent idea that could have been creepy but was instead silly and with even more stupidity and illogic than the previous sequel.Many have said that no awards will be given for good dialogue and acting. That's putting it lightly. The script is clunky and cheesy ineptitude throughout and the acting, Dan O'Herlihy excepted, is pretty awful and fails to do anything with such dull and annoying characters. The gore is gratuitous, the ending is a big head-scratcher and the non-horror scenes are ineptly directed (in a film where direction reeked of inexperience), written and acted.In summation, mediocre and not so happy. Not quite as bad as reputed though. 4/10 Bethany Cox"

But there's suspense here and a great open ending where the protagonist loses. And the film is not stretched in contrast to the first 2 parts of Halloween, it has optimal timing.
