      "text": "Thanks to a typically brilliant performance by Isabelle Huppert (and really, when is she not great), and Paul Verhoeven working at peak power. ELLE takes what could have been a typical rape-revenge thriller and transforms into something else entirely. Subverting expectations at every moment, taking the story to twisted and twisty, not to mention disturbing, areas I was not expecting. This is a compulsively compelling character study that leaves much to discuss and gets better the more one thinks about it. Layered and unforgettable."

      "text": "Isabelle Huppert has never been better than in this wonderfully constructed drama by Paul Verhoeven. Although positioning a rape front and centre, this is no ordinary revenge drama but a well written and directed character driven thriller that keeps you guessing as to the culprit's identity despite a few red herrings being thrown into the mix. It's fair to say that the film is about 10 minutes too long and for those paying close attention the eventual unmasking of the guilty party comes as no big surprise. Compelling and stylish film making non-the less."

      "rating": "7",
      "text": "A disturbing and twisted yet strangely compelling story of sexual compulsion and antisocial behavior that says as much about the society in which we exist as it does about the characters on the screen. Many of the film's shocking sequences are on par with those found in pictures like \"A Clockwork Orange\" and definitely not for the squeamish nor faint of heart, but its superb lead performance by Isabelle Huppert nevertheless keeps one's eyes glued to the screen, almost no matter what happens. Those easily offended by violence and explicit sexuality would be wise to skip this one, but viewers who appreciate a provocative psychological thriller with a singularly cynical, macabre wit may find this an irresistible guilty pleasure."

It\u00b4s definitely engaging form beginning to end (despite being long, many things happen). Most of the characters if not all are quite amoral probably in an attempt at reflecting what all of us humans can be. Good and bad. Way more exaggerated than what most people in real life are in my opinion, but that\u00b4s not a problem of the film of course. A lot of issues are approached regarding sex most of all, also other types of relationships and mental states. Every actor plays their part successfully and nothing will leave you indifferent. A very strong 8/10 from me for a very daring and out there film."

For another--her unlikeability isn't shown as a weakness of character. The less you know going into this one, the better. One of the best performances of the year by Isabelle Huppert. Great thriller."

He tipped his hand beyond recovery (in a sane industry) with the so laughably horrendous \"Showgirls\" that it became one of those rare movies so terrible it gets notoriety and watched anyway as 'so bad it's good'. This junk blatantly rips off \"Jagged Edge\" (not just the mask but also the score, cam, cuts), which it would be an understatement to say is about 100 times better than this puke. You've got to be a fool to tolerate this hoax or just a pseudo euro trash film snob who is either dishonest with themselves or has no clue what a good movie is."

This movie's main characters, supposedly bright, accomplished people, act stupidly again and again for the entire length of the story--offering ridiculous justifications for their stupidity.  How stupidly?  A rape victim doesn't go to the hospital or police to collect her attacker's DNA.  In fact, she submits to his attacks twice more!  Tough to sit through this one."

      "text": "Look, I'm not even going to engage the question of whether this movie is essentially misogynist or not. I'm going to take the film at face value. Because I actually enjoyed the first third of the movie immensely. Isabelle Huppert's performance is fantastic and compelling, the concept of a woman dealing with a violent rape by sitting back and methodically preparing to take her revenge, and the way she treads through the male world she lives in are all compelling ideas!But the story is a train wreck! And not in an enjoyable way!The first engine of the movie is Elle's mission to track down her rapist. Very compelling.Then we get this backstory that her father was a mass murderer. Also interesting enough to keep me watching. But not tied in to the rest of the movie in anyway whatsoever. It almost seems random.And then some very boring subplots about her whiney son and his obnoxious girlfriend, and some casual relationships with the other people in her life. No tension driving those subplots.And then! *spoiler alert*She discovers her rapist, it's the neighbor she has a crush on! Wow, interesting! The person she's been trying to track down this whole time! But then, she seemingly doesn't care at all! She lets him go, gets into a random car rack which he saves her from for some bizarre reason, she continues to hang out with him, he rapes her again but it's bizarre because the movie plays this like it's a bad thing but she also wants it maybe? Not clear. And then he tries to rape her again in the end which is totally undramatic at this point because she's totally given up on trying to stop him from raping her.The last third of the movie lacks tension or any compelling conflict at all. This could've been a good movie. :("

      "text": "\u201cElle\u201d is a French film based on the novel \u201cOh\u2026\u201d written by Philippe Dijan (\u201cBetty Blue\u201d) with a screenplay by David Birke. Directed by Paul Verhoeven the movie stars Isabelle Huppert, Charles Berling and Laurent Lafitte in this tale of a woman who is raped and how she copes with the incident. The rape scenes are brutal in their violence and makes the viewing of the film an uneasy experience. What is more uneasy is the mind of the viewer as he or she recalls and tries to understand the theatrical presentation they have just seen for the story is complicated and made even more so by the subtitles. I am sure a French viewer would find the film easier to understand than his or her English-speaking counterpart. All that being said, this film is filled with suspense and mystery and, more than anything else, is a tribute and testament to the talents of Ms. Huppert. Her unbelievable ability to communicate and exude various degrees of emotions and sex appeal without ever uttering a word speaks volumes to her amazing acting ability.  I give a 7.5 with a warning for the squeamish viewer to beware."

      "text": "This movie starts with a rape. The woman who's attacked (Isabelle Huppert), goes into stealth mode, playing down the effects of this act of aggression. There are some notable parallels: she runs a company that creates violent video games and a relative is a serial killer. This film seems like it's headed to a revenge narrative (it is directed by Paul Verhoven, who's no stranger to sex and violence in his work), but expands into a compelling character study of a seemingly stable woman harboring a number of issues. Huppert is always fascinating to watch, even as the character seems to spiral in unexpected directions. It's not exemplary, but it is an unusual, complex and interesting experience."

Too much to be contained in a well crafted scenario and swallowed by the audience.  Isabelle Huppert did reveal a cold faced woman who isn't easily shaken even when raped!! A movie to be seen more than once but without acquiring high grades.  It is like eating too much of everything without finishing a dish!!"

Tells the story of a woman, with a horrible past, that could traumatize every kid in the world; and that is violated in her adulthood. Michele\u2019s stoicism is breathtaking; the struggle she gets in is astoundingly portrayed: the rebirth of her past and the imperious impulse to move on with her life. This awful happening will affect, without her noticing, her love life and the relationship with her mom, son and friends. Regardless it seems that the protagonist didn\u2019t change after the assault, it\u2019s because of what she lived as child, that prepared herself, in a way the viewer can imagine, for borderline situations. The director\u2019s hand doesn\u2019t tremble for showing the reality, the script is very clever and Isabelle Huppert is magnificent and her performance gives you chills."

      "text": "On December 20 I wrote a review of \u201cThings To Come\u201d a movie starring Isabelle Huppert.    In it I said,\u201cIsabelle Huppert is one of those rare actresses who can be doing one thing while her face shows, expresses, shows deeper  emotions. Huppert is an interesting actress to watch and I am looking forward to seeing her in \u201cElle\u201d, a much praised with Oscar talk performance, which can only add to her stellar resume.\u201dI saw \u201cElle\u201d, for which she was just nominated for an Oscar as Best Actress, deservedly so, and who I will be rooting for on Sunday February 26 on the Oscar telecast. Up to seeing this movie I was hoping Ruth Negga would win for \u201cLoving\u201d. In any case they are more deserving than Emma Stone, who I have nothing against though her performance comes nowhere these two.Isabelle Huppert plays Michele Leblanc, a video game executive, who, during the first scene of the movie, is brutally attacked and raped by a masked man. While there are flashbacks to this particular act there are also repeat attacks and Michele\u2019s reaction to them seems to change from fear to desire almost as if she was controlling the man and what was happening.There are many suspects from Patrick (Laurent Lafitte), a married neighbor, to Robert (Christian Berkel), Michele\u2019s lover and whose wife Anne (Anne Consigny) is Michele\u2019s best friend and business partner. There are also some of the men who work for her from one who doesn\u2019t like her and another who follows her around like a puppy. There is also her ex-husband Richard (Charles Berling) not quite as successful as she is.Along with her various reactions to her attacker Michele also has a 22-23 year old son Vincent (Jonas Bloquet)  who has a girlfriend Josie (Alice Isaac) and thinks he is the father of their child which is, obviously, wrong plus Josie having attitude to both Vincent and Michele. There is Michelle\u2019s mother Irene (Judith Magre) who is very full of herself and has a stroke while in the background is her father who committed a horrendous mass homicide when Michele was a young girl and was in the middle of the surrounding publicity.While Michelle is pulled in many directions along with trying to find out who her rapist was/is and wanting to control him and the situation Isabelle Huppert commands us, letting us see what she wants us to see, keep us guessing what she may be thinking and feeling but you believe everything she shows you.Partially a character study and partially a psychological thriller \u201cElle\u201d is a film with excellent performances, top production values from the soundtrack to the photography with sharp direction and a good screenplay all held together by Isabelle Huppert who, after 100 movies and at the age of 64, shows what the best acting is like!A definite must see!"

That's for a moment, once I finished watching it, realised it's a better film. I mean I changed my stance, after over and over thinking about the film. So its the patience you need, wait till the film to end to decide how much you liked it. It was too long, but every space was filled up with the best parts. It took time to understand the characters, and with multiple angle events in one woman's life. Isabelle Huppert was amazing. Despite so many characters in the film, she ruled it. One of her best films I have seen.The film focused on the boss of a video game designing firm. It opens with as she's been sexually assaulted in her home by an intruder. Followed by one of her employees morphed her face to an animated character as a sexual explicit material for the game they are working in. So she begins her investigation to find both the culprit who might be the same person. This is where the suspense comes into play to develop interest in us. Besides, facing family troubles takes some extra development. Subsequently, all the mysteries will be solved and to know how it ends, you should watch it.\"Michele to her cat: You did not have to claw his eyes out, but scratch him at least.\"It is official French submission to the 89th American Academy Awards. But as per the latest news bulletin, this film is out of the Oscars race, despite made into the Golden Globes. From the director of the original 'Total Recall' and his first French film. Based on the book named 'Oh...'. But I felt it was developed from a small part of 'The Little Death'. Basically, there's an understanding being it is the story of the adults, despite the sexual violences and that's how this story was built. So you must compromise on a few things that is shown in it if you really want to enjoy it.I did not like it all the sudden, though looking back all the film events and joining them together made me see the film was decent. Especially that final line said by a woman who was evacuating her house makes whole thing sense. Maybe that's the real twist in the tale. Initially I did not think to write a review, but surely it deserved one from me, so I wrote this short and quick. This is the film for the grown ups, but not for all the grown ups. So I hope it will meet your expectation if you decide to try, but according to me definitely it is worth.7/10"

Can rape ever be funny? No, but when you find out who the rapist is in this film \u2013 and who his wife is \u2013 maybe then you will begin to understand Huppert\u2019s Michele Leblanc and see the many absurdities and ironies in this film. When you meet Michele\u2019s parents and learn about her father, you may understand her cockeyed life more clearly. And you may even find yourself laughing and admiring how Isabelle Huppert manages to make such a character come alive so that you understand and even sympathize with her."
