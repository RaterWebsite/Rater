      "text": "This undoubtedly a very good film. Leonardo DiCaprio is phenomenal in the lead role and really embodies Howard Hughes. Throughout, it barely felt like acting, rather it felt like I was watching Howard Hughes in a documentary, which is truly amazing. John C. Reilly, Cate Blanchett, and Alan Alda also really stood out in what was a very large and talented cast for this one. Martin Scorsese's direction is also fantastic as usual. Thanks to his direction, we get a very clear picture of what was a very troubled genius due to the great storytelling. Also thanks to his direction, the almost three hour run time feels more like an hour. The cinematography is also something to behold here, as the entire film is really beautifully put together. Sometimes with Scorsese, though I love his films, I can feel that little bit, \"Well I liked that, but I thought it would be better,\" but here, there was no such feeling as this really lived up to the hype for me and more and really stands tall as a great biopic of one of the brightest men in recent times."

I guess I was waiting for that POW to knock me off my feet and it never came around. I really don't have any complaints about this movie (other than it was pretty long) just that it didn't really catch my attention. I will say however Leonardo DiCaprio's performance was Oscar worthy, not sure why he is overlooked by some.

But the problem is leo's face. He still looks like a teenager and when he plays a grown up person's role you just can't accept it. But as always martin scorsese's direction was awesome and although the movies runtime is nearly 3 hours but you never get bored. The other actors also were good, specially alec baldwin.

Another bright spot was the sound and cinematography. Everything about this film looked and sounded phenomenal. However, all of that goes down the drain because the plot is terrible. It's scattered, jumping from one thing to the other all the time and it doesn't really go anywhere. There's not really a story, more like a series of events. and the movie lasts about 40 minutes longer than it should. it's really sad because this could have turned out great but it sucked"

      "text": "From the talented Martin Scorsesse comes an admittedly ambitious but compelling and visually stirring biopic on legendary rebel billionaire Howard Hughes. Although it is nearly three hours, I don't think the film dragged that much and I was gripped for the whole duration. My problem is to do with the secondary characters though. The Aviator is one of those films where a lot of detail goes into making the protagonist and a few more key characters convincing and relateable, but the secondary characters aren't given as much attention as well. This is not the first film to have this problem though, Kinsey which was still very good had it too, as did Chaplin. Back on target, actors like Willem Dafoe and Ian Holm are not given that much to do, they do fine with what they have, but their characters have the sense of appearing there one minute and disappearing the next. Another problem was that occasionally the drama was lacking, the story was well constructed and paced, and the themes here are very ambitious, but other than well staged plane scenes parts of the more dramatic parts felt somewhat lukewarm.Complaints aside, this is still a very good film. First of all, it is amazing to look at, the scenery is gorgeous and the costumes are sumptuous. The music is also a delight, beautiful and poignant, dramatic and haunting in others. I loved the small clips of Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor, orchestrated here and it works(it was originally written for organ you see), and Tchaikovsky's 5th and 6th Symphonies, the latter of which has a final movement that is so heart-rending as it always reminds me of death, don't ask why though. The Aviator is brilliantly directed by Scorcesse, and the script does have moments of meaningful power. And the acting is pretty exceptional. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his better post-Titanic performances here, he proves he is more than a person that is all looks no talent, for he really is brilliant as Howard Hughes. Cate Blanchett is wonderful as well as Katherine Hepburn, and Kate Beckinsale surprised me. Like DiCaprio, she too proves that she is more than a pretty face by giving a really good account of herself as Ava Gardner while looking absolutely amazing in the process. In a smaller role, Alec Baldwin was also enjoyable.Overall, not absolutely outstanding, but The Aviator is a very striking, ambitious and compelling biopic. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

      "text": "The Aviator is a entertaining biopic which paints a picture of the life of Howard Hughes, the  aviation pioneer who dealt with various physical and mental health issues during his lifetime. Though the movie is nearly three hours long, there's hardly a dull moment. Viewers watch the highs and lows which Hughes had over the course of a 20 year period (1927-1947). The storytelling is excellent and will keep you hooked throughout the movie's duration. In addition to the compelling storyline, the production design and cinematography are amazing. The movie wouldn't be as good as it was, though, without DiCaprio's stellar performance as Hughes. DiCaprio's performance alone makes this movie worth watching. Overall, The Aviator is an interesting biopic about the interesting character that was Howard Hughes, and it's definitely worth a watch."

      "text": "There are few historical characters who live as intense and interesting as the eccentric and controversial Howard Hughes. He started by inheriting a tool company but his passion for aviation took him to other flights, much higher and more notable, making him one of the pioneers of aeronautics and, also, of spoken cinema. This film is truly luxurious in all aspects and is probably one of the films that will mark Di Caprio's career.The plot starts with Hughes' efforts to shoot \"Hell's Angels\", first as a silent film and then as a sound film, a super-production that cost him a lot of money. The film also shows Hughes' loving connections to renowned actresses like Katharine Hepburn or Ava Gardner, the US Senate's investigations into public money that he received in order to manufacture military planes that he never delivered, the creation and expansion of TWA Airline and, finally, the psychological disorder that Hughes suffered, and that were related to a serious form of phobia to germs and diseases.The film was expertly directed by Martin Scorsese and features a luxurious cast led by Leonardo Di Caprio, in one of the most interesting and rich roles of his career, which is already enviable at all levels. The actor worked hard and committed himself deeply to the psychological portrait of the millionaire who, little by little, sees his energy and entrepreneurship undermined by his growing phobia. Beside him is Cate Blanchett, in the role of the willful actress Katharine Hepburn. And here, honestly, I'm not sure what to think. I don't know Hepburn very well, I don't know if what Blanchett did was really true to the portrait of that actress, but I thought that sometimes it seemed a bit like a caricature. Anyway, she won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, which should indicate something. Kate Beckinsale also makes an interesting appearance in the role of young Ava Gardner while Alec Baldwin and Ian Holm were good additions and did well with what was asked of them.Technically, the film has high production values and a lot of quality. Cinematography is excellent and there is a lot of CGI involved, always of good quality and very realistic. The film is essentially set in the 30s and 60s of the last century, so the sets and costumes rightly make an effort to respond to these changes and put on the right props. The soundtrack also deserves special mention because it not only has an epic and adventurous feel to it, but it is easily heard."
