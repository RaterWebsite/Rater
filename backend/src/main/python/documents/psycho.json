Psycho is one of my favorite horror movies of all time and what did they get, a nobody director and a wasted script. Hitchcock was right on one thing. He shouldn't need any color. Insult to injury, this shot-by-shot remake is definitely one of the worst remakes Hollywood needs to stay away. It's pretty stupid when you add Anne Heche, Vince Vaughn (as Young Norman Bates), and Gus Van Sant as a director who just doesn't know what the original version is all about. The original version features not only has one of the scariest theme songs of all time, but the shower scene where Bates slashed his wife is very memorable. At least, we desperately need a proper remake. But stick to the Hitchcock classic."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "OH MY GOD!!! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE GUS VAN SANT?!!! It's just a shot for shot remake!

Just modernizing the original with a bigger budget takes no creativity and falls into the tedium and redundancy which most horror fan's hate.\r Gus Van Sant's Psycho remake, where nearly every scene is \"copied exactly,\" is a perfect example of this. It was simply BORING. Even for those that never saw this first, the pacing is just too slow for the high-octane generations of the 90's and beyond.\r For a re-make to resonate with an audience that knows the original by heart, it has to deliver a new and different version while staying within the bounds of the original framework. We should be thankful because no director will try this again. For the secret formula to successful horror re-makes, watch 2012's The Evil Dead, 2004's Dawn of the Dead or David Cronenberg's The Fly (1986)."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "A pointless remake of a movie that should have been left alone in the first place.
