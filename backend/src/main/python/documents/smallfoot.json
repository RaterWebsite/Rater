I was so impressed by how both communicated deep political themes in a fashion that kids can understand, something more animated films need to pay more attention to.How does that relate to Smallfoot? Well, from the trailer alone, I expected surface-level substance made just for kids and nobody else, and the finished product is in fact a bit more than that. While not better than The LEGO Movie or Zootopia, the Warner Animation Group still provide surprisingly deep social commentary about border control, abuse of the working class, communication with differences, and even past religious influence on an economic climate.The pale blue yeti colony upon a Himalayan mountaintop are not like the rising and setting sun they worship, they follow a strict belief system written on stone tablets; if it\u2019s not written in stone (literally), it\u2019s false. Yes, even if it means the stones say a yak\u2019s anus created their mountain which giant mammoths hold up on their backs, they believe it. These folks are under the rule of a Stonekeeper who wears these laws. Those rough ancient stones make the Stonekeeper appear clung to past ideas that weigh him down, along with every worker who labor for nothing but to cover up a big political lie that could explain why there\u2019s more clouds in the sky. That doesn\u2019t make this land any more believable unfortunately: within this ice-behemoth utopia, the mammoths are dogs and the snails are lamps, which proves nothing more than servitude for the convenience of gags over common sense, much like any computer animation studio that isn\u2019t Disney or Pixar.Anyhow, the main character of the story, Migo, has a father who holds a crucial duty of headbutting a giant gong via slingshot morning after morning to wake the giant snail (sun) in the sky. His head is flattened from continual gong striking\u2014a hazardous old tradition that Migo will someday assume. That\u2019s why he feels a calling to something greater, something new, something that\u2026 starts with a slow-motion pratfall when he slips on snow. Yeah\u2026 there\u2019s still a lot of cheap humor that makes the first two acts a little tedious. The blandness of the feature gets to be a bit more noticeable once Migo meets a human named Percy, or the mythical \u201csmallfoot.\u201d A language barrier prevents proper communication between these two as an attempt to drive the film\u2019s heart, although not enough boosts their bond to the extent of WALL-E and EVE.At least the architecture of rock murals influenced by the yetis\u2019 mythological beliefs give some extra meaning in the visuals, including a yellow butterfly (representing new thinking) frozen inside a blue icicle (representing old thinking) focused on during one musical number. Yes, there\u2019s numerous dull songs scattered throughout as if an attempt to rip off Disney, none of which are a \u201cCircle of Life\u201d or \u201cHakuna Matata\u201d kind of deal. The staging of these songs is unimaginative too, as Percy at one point leads a love song surrounded by YouTube videos against blackness, which just looks forced. Also, the Stonekeeper raps, which doesn\u2019t make sense considering he would have no way of knowing what such a music genre is. As much as the artists try to convey a love for nature, it can\u2019t lift a story dragged by a constantly quick pace.Though the well-done animation itself does masterfully blow Migo\u2019s hair to a thick blizzard that blankets the view, much more attractive than anything similar from twenty years ago. Plus, the facial expressions are just right, unhidden and memorable to enhance some nice laughs scattered throughout. One of the more notable examples includes a toilet paper roll dubbed a \u201cscroll of invisible wisdom,\u201d plenty funny enough to sustain excitement. But those genuinely funny moments are far from consistent, as the poor directorial pacing ends numerous jokes way too soon for an effective punchline. The direction suffers a bit too from the painful slapstick that defies physics: Migo\u2019s rubbery body survives falling 500 feet then getting sandwiched between two rock pillars. Yeah, it\u2019s a cartoon, but such a lack of care in establishing real danger removes all tension.That\u2019s really the whole kit-and-kaboodle of Smallfoot: despite how its main human character plans to fake yeti sightings for the sake of viewers, there\u2019s still the other useless plot devices, such as a dead mother, that stop this butterfly from fully emerging from its chrysalis. Therefore, the harmless entertainment will keep the kids entertained, with just enough depth to make the parents not tear their hair out; and that\u2019s the truth."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "\"Small foot\" has nothing you want in a children's musical.The songs are cheesy, the story is an awful plot.

Same thing with this animated film, it bounds out of the gate with a bouncy song and lots of physical comedy. When the titular character starts to complicate the story, the fun starts to dip, while messages of acceptance move to the fore. None of the characters, including expected zany supporting roles are especially memorable. The remaining musical numbers aren't as inventive or catchy.

While learning how to ring a gong from his father in the morning (by catapulting and hitting the gong with the head), he missed the gong and flew out of the village. Out there, he discovered a human pilot (who crashed his plane) which he and the Yetis called them \u2018smallfoot\u2019 as the Yetis believed they are just a legend.Unable to prove the existence of a human (or smallfoot) to the Yetis in his village, the village chief, Stonekeeper, banished him until he can come to his senses. With the help of the Stonekeeper\u2019s daughter, Meechee (Zendaya) and her secret group which she led called Smallfoot Evidentiary Society, they helped him go down below the clouds to bring a human up to the village to prove their existence and end his banishment.At a local town, Percy Patterson (Corden) is a wildlife documentary filmmaker; saw an opportunity after he learnt the existence of the Yetis from the human pilot who crashed his plane earlier. Hoping to revive his career, he begins his quest to look for Yetis until he sees Migo in town with his own eyes. With a human meeting a Yeti in public, the comical, misunderstanding and misadventures starts here.Although this movie may not be as hype as Disney or Pixar movies, this movie is still fun and enjoyable for younger viewers. The plot of the movie is simple to understand and not a rocket science. The songs in this movie are quite nice and I can see that the cast put some efforts in singing which I totally enjoyed it. There are many funny moments in the movie that can tickle your bone, especially with scenes involving a \u2018communication\u2019 between human and Yeti.While the movie does not exactly utilise a big bad villain, it also means that not every movies intended for younger viewers must have a big bad villain.

This knack of creating a whole new world and jumping on another perspective to draw in the laughs and humanize the characters- it may sound like a long procedure- is clearly outdated. And addition to that with chalky conversation that raises doubts more than it advances the storyline, it shucks away the integrity within first few minutes. The music too isn't engaging or melodious to convince us to hum along (except for the last track) but what's worse above all is the fact that it isn't an essential part of the narration, it feels like the makers are spending up their time.The emotional shots that will help you connect instantly are frankly cheap and manipulative, overriding the only piece of content that they have, this predictable storytelling gives away everything in one shot and then is left with nothing but petty laughs and empty music notes. The background tale of blending in the nature of wilderness and social animals, is narrowed down to a better and admirable point but with that comes a great amount of baggage that you ought to lop off and suffer for; not a fair trade.Aforementioned the humor is quite childish, it is one thing to not explore new territories and draw a line on R rated ones, and another to have a pun that is incompetent to draw in a single laugh. But still with fumbles like this here and there and ironical comedy as it puts us in a different shoes, the film qualifies with good visuals and a happy go lucky tone. Tatum, Zendaya and Corden lifts up few tunes nicely with some good work on voicing their characters.

Your grip is doing wonderful! The Teen Titans Go movie almost made you trip over and die! Same with the Emoji Movie but this movie saved your life! The plot gets too fast and way too confusing at times but the animation is very nice!"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "The main message is surprisingly refreshing, well-set, quite important, and above all, could appeal to and resonate with everyone whatever how old is he/she.An issue I had with Pixar's Oscar-winner, Coco is that it has too many secondary messages that besides they were ridiculously excessive, they were intrusive, confusing that made me not even sure what the main moral was, heavy-handed, and completely unnecessary to the main plot. Fortunately, It's not totally the same case here. Of course, the other minor messages and lessons that are conveyed throughout the movie can feel redundant and annoyingly in-your-face, but the good thing is that they are never distracting nor unnecessary. They are justified either by the connection to the characters' arcs, or by the fact the every sub-plot lead to the other finely. In doing so, the main message has never been overshadowed, and was predominant at all parts of the movie.Yes, the movie is literally split to a number of parts. But, alas, almost every part consists of a totally familiar, and infuriatingly predictable story that you can easily see how it will end a million miles away. Honestly, you can even readily predict the decisions the characters will make, nay the lines the characters will say!The humor lacks originality just as the story does. This actually added insult to injury, because when I tried to pass over the fact I know how this plotline will end, I found myself watching some insufferably boring, and utterly bland and uninspiring visual gags that are just not funny. The Jokes in general in this movie are pretty lame. I didn't had a single laugh throughout the entire runtime of the movie, but I smiled a couple of times, to be honest.So, it's clear that there are a lot of \"I've seen this before\" moments in this movie, and that shouldn't be surprising, for most of animated movies nowadays have this problem. But Smallfoot didn't settle on one generic story due to the episodic structure it has, and that's what amplified the feeling of familiarity, and made the clich\u00e9s blatantly noticeable. But even the majority of the songs are totally unremarkable, and some of them are badly placed and feel interruptive, but all the songs are by no means bad. Actually, they are all good!As much as I found the first fifty minutes of the movie kinda dull due to the formulaic storylines as I mentioned above, especially the first act which was moving in a most predictable pattern that even its absurdly fast pace couldn't save it from not being boring, there were some twists and turns that happened at the beginning of the third act that really elevated the whole movie. I won't say the new path the movie took after these twists, especially the major one, wasn't familiar. But the good thing is that it's not predictable. And I really mean that I finally didn't know how the movie would end, and I think that's the most important thing. Not to mention that I was really intrigued, and really excited to know what the characters would decide, what they would do next, and how the things would turn out. And surprisingly the movie kept surprising me till the very end.The movie is filled with eye-popping colorful slapstick sequences that are just delightful to watch. The quality of the animation is top-notch, and the landscapes and the snow are simply dazzling. Let alone the well-designed characters.The voice cast is solid, if not extraordinary by any means. I liked James Corden as the \"Smallfoot\", Percy, though. But it's Danny DeVito's vocal performance as Dorgle, Migo's dad, that I found quite unique and uncanny. Channing Tatum is fine as Migo, and the same goes with Zendaya as Meechee.Smallfoot is so not nothingness, it's definitely somethingness! But I wish the story was as original as its message, and I wish the humor was as good as its animation.(7/10)"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "This was an entertaining experience! I\u00b4m a digital animation student and I watched this one because I was told it had very good animation, and it does. Also, the pictures in most of the film are just beautiful, the snow, the mountains, and the colorful sky. But as it has very good things, it lacks in other things like the character design. The movie was very appealing but the characters had no real personalities, just a lot of stereotypes and all along simple yetis or humans. I really prefer the Yeti on Monsters Inc.The story does have a good message, but it was very easy to predict. Also, I felt the movie to be a little longer than it really was, maybe because at some point it appeared to have finished, but then it continued.
