No wonder why Jordan Peele ceases to amaze me when he came from a sketch comedy background on MadTV all the way to directing/producing Oscar winning films and he has made an another horror classic similar to what Stanley Kubrick has done with The Shining. If I were you, try to see 'Us' at least twice."

The story/plot was fresh, original, exciting and dynamic(we all coulda guessed that also). The trailers left out a lot(pretty much all) of the plot so that was good. The cast did perfect, even the supporting actors. There were a few and minor character flaws while the story was building, but all that went away when the \u201cother families\u201d showed up. Solid dramatic/suspense movie with a little humor peppered in throughout, but not overdone. Nice wind up during the home stretch, and ended with a solid but subtle twist. They could leave the ending as is and let our minds wonder, or they could maaaaaybe do a sequel, MAYBE. (I'm sure they won't)If you liked early M. Night and Get Out.... you\u2019ll obviously love this."

Director Jordan Peele's second feature defies the sophomore jinx, delivering an expertly crafted allegorical story that's captivating and insightful while delivering great laughs and a few good scares without becoming gratuitous. As good as his first picture, \"Get Out,\" was, the filmmaker has taken a quantum leap in his artistry and storytelling skills with this release, an accomplishment that will likely allow him to write his own ticket from here on out. I can't wait to see it again!"

From there, things get fun, in a suspenseful way. The scares and violence are peppered with Peele's comic smarts. The father character (Winston Duke) is certainly channeling Peele's own style. While the concept behind the doppelgangers is promising, there are some questions marks that throw the logic off the rails a bit. Still, it's an inventive and engrossing addition to the genre."

The implications of the twist just are not all that interesting to me.  And the \"other world\" of the doubles just didn't have the same kind of impact that the zombies in classics like \"Dawn of the Dead\" have. Sure, they mimic the regular humans, but to what end?  I should say that Elizabeth Moss is also great, and really, the kids are, too.  You definitely laugh a few times in this film, but the sense of real dread and true suspense are just not present in this film.  I do look forward to Peele's next one."

The movie isn't always as successful as its predecessor in exploring the heady themes of identity and control that it evokes, and is a messier, less coherent experience as a result, but nevertheless remains compelling throughout. The impressive cast members all show considerable range in playing two vastly different characters, particularly Lupita Nyong'o, who shines both as the desperate, terrified but determined matriarch as well as her sinister, calculated doppelganger with a voice straight out of a nightmare. The confidence with which Peele and his performers pull it all off is ultimately what rescues the project from itself, however, and it remains enough of an unnerving experience on a purely visceral level to remain enjoyable for horror fans looking for something a little more than ghostly ghouls and silent slashers."

      "text": "First of all, Jordan Peele knocked it out of the park with this film. He directed, wrote, and produced this film. With every scene, he directed it to perfection so you knew what was happening to this family and what to feel. This wouldn\u2019t be possible unless the actors did their job to the best of their abilities and easily they did. Once the invaders come into their house and the tension grows that is when some of their best acting comes out. They make you sympathize with them and want them to survive. The one person who stood out the most to me though was Lupita Nyong\u2019o mainly because she is the main one you follow throughout the film. But she easily stole the whole film from beginning to end. Even the kid actors, Shahadi Wright Joseph, and Evan Alex did outstanding jobs and I hope they will go far with their careers. The music in this film also helped set the tone and mood in specific scenes. Every time the music started you automatically knew that something was going to happen. This film is already one hour and fifty-six minutes and it doesn\u2019t feel like it one bit. The movie flows really well from scene to scene and you can easily understand what is happening without knowing what\u2019s coming up next. I have to mention that the cinematography, especially in the scene where you don\u2019t know yet that the people are them, is really well done. This film isn\u2019t perfect but most of my problems are spoilers so I won\u2019t mention them but they are minor and still don\u2019t take away from how great of a film this is. In the end, Us is a great time for anybody whether you like horror movies or not, especially because I would classify it as a thriller. I highly recommend checking this film out."

The tiny nuances through the writing and acting allow for the audience to interpret both the film as a whole and the ending in so many different ways, which I originally believed didn't work, yet after having time to think about the film it shows a great political commentary as an undertone whilst subverting the expectations of the horror genre and creating an overall brilliant film."

      "text": "Horror/thriller Us, about a family being attacked by duplicates of themselves, was such a unique experience for me. This is only Jordan Peele's second film and he already has a confident sense of direction. Tightly controlled use of camera angles and fine use of color and scenery are all here. The panning out opening credits has a slow, unsettling strangeness to it. As I said, this is a thriller and the whole thing has taught pacing and fight scenes.The general story is entertainingly freaky. The duplicates, with their scary gold scissors and gloves on only one hand, are unsettling. And it isn't exactly like they're a mindless horde. Each one has a distinct, weird personality.The script is also pretty funny at points, but the humor never feels like it is detracting from the horror.The music by Michael Abels is also delightfully eerie. Be sure to check out the opening credits. The movie's main theme might make the list of most recognizable horror music. (It sounds a little like the main theme from Akira if you've seen that.)The entire cast, main and supporting, is great, including, surprisingly, comedian Tim Heidecker from Adult Swim's Tim and Eric. Winston Duke is fun as the family's goofy father and Lupita Nyongo excels in creepiness as the duplicate mother.The first act/setup is a little slow, but things run smoothly once the duplicates attack. The explanation to the duplicates' existence is a little vague. I mean the duplicate's motivations are made clear, but the logistical details of the whole thing leaves a lot of questions. Overall, i highly recommend this to people who are looking for something a little new in horror."

You won't be sorry, it's creepy, it's scary and it's well worth the ticket price.Now hopefully you'll have a better experience than I did at my local cinema house, horror audiences tend to be the most disruptive of cinema audiences unfortunately. No film is going to benefit from someone else's conversation but particularly a horror movie that relies on silence and atmosphere is going to suffer if you've got some absolute **** in the screen. So yes the experience was ruined for me a little, gotta hate my local cinema sometimes but I still managed to enjoy\u00a0Us. From the opening scene you're reeled into this story, the impending sense of doom is constant, it's not just relying on endless jump scares, instead actually working at building up to a premise you can buy into and by the time the weird **** starts happening you can just sit back and let yourself be creeped out, scared and entertained.\u00a0Maybe weird doesn't even do it justice, it's insane and although a little predictable at times and very in your face with the other film references I loved the idea for this story. The entire cast is giving it their all and more, double the roles and double the pressure. Lupita is exceptional, her performance will send chills down your spine. The casting could have easily ruined this film, it could have drifted into ridiculous but for the most part it didn't. It does try to get the humour into it yet for me that wasn't really working, it uses humour to defuse the tension and honestly I would have preferred if it didn't. Jordan Peele set the bar very high with\u00a0Get Out, and to be fair\u00a0it's a hard movie to follow.\u00a0The mix of humour and horror worked very well in\u00a0Get Out\u00a0but for\u00a0Us\u00a0it just wasn't doing it for me. I would have preferred all horror and no attempt at humour. I'm looking forward to see what Jordan Peele will make next, he's creating horror movies that aren't an endless parade of jump scares with little to no story whose sole purpose is to make as much money as possible.

In Get Out the two aspects worked in synergy to generate each other. Every moment comedy contributed to every uneasy feeling and vice versa. Us seems to work in a similar manner only instead of being co-dependent, they seem to bolster each other. It plays all it's cards with a straight face, even when the movie delves into complete absurd, goofy, and stupid territory, it never pauses to let the viewer become self-aware. Thus never getting sucked out of the experience. Us is a roller coaster ride of different genres that blend together for an experience that's an overall delight. My only gripe is that I think the script may have needed another glance over.*SPOILERS*The one thing I didn't like was the ending. The twist comes at a point where it doesn't matter anymore. Who cares at that point who was a doppleganger or not? None of these dopplegangers ever show any intention of switching places verbatim with their counterparts. If characters didn't know they were dopplegangers before and acted completely normal, why should that matter? The movie doesn't give us some reason to allude they're any more or less dangerous than the anyone else and it's never touched on this possibility before or after. There's just no motivation to b frightened by this sudden realization when this character has to our knowledge, been a normal person most of their lives and had no reason to be feared before the twist was revealed. It just feels very hammed in and like a decision that could've been easily cut or revealed at a point in time when it mattered in the movie or could've been given a consequence that had impact on the dynamic of the story."

Underneath this political garbage there's actually quite an intense horror, which is such a shame, because if Peele just concentrated on making an entertaining, believable and coherent film instead of ramming his political agenda down our throats, we'd walk away more entertained. Another thing that let it down was the script. Why are this family making jokes whilst they're being stalked and treating it all so light heartedly? It makes the mood so jarring.

It's a first-rate horror film that tackles relevant social and political issues in a manner that allows it to be both deep and entertaining. Those hoping to find the same kind of thematic timeliness here are not likely to be disappointed. They may, however, take issue with the delivery. Peele clearly has a lot on his mind and spreads himself too thin trying to cram it all into one movie. Us is littered with so many symbolic possibilities such as classism, race, and the dual hidden nature of humanity (among so much more) that it's hard to pull any sort of cohesive message from it at all. He manages to briefly touch on each of these topics, but never manages to make them come together in a way that actually says anything.Us may be unfocused subtext-wise, but it's only marginally less valuable because of it. The moment-to-moment action is so good that it's incredibly easy to overlook the contextual and narrative deficiencies, like how the plot twist is really just a big plot hole. To put it simply, I think Us is even more fun than Get Out.It's hard for me to not walk away from most horror-comedies disappointed as they tend to lean too far on one extreme more often than not. Us manages to be the rare exception that acts as the perfect marriage between the two genres. Both styles come off as complimentary, never serving to pull power away from the other. The film ends up being both hilarious and freaky as a result.It does a lot to help keep the fairly familiar home invasion/slasher action fresh, but the imaginative premise and excellent dual performance from Lupita Nyong'o that are the real heavy lifters here. In reference to the latter, I'm hearing a lot of people call her performance award worthy. I personally wouldn't go that far, but her work here is impressive. Especially as the creepy and menacing doppelganger.Peele also makes the most of the concept by once again crafting a slew of unforgettable, unsettling, and inventive scenarios and situations. I'm not just talking about the more violent or bizarre set pieces either. The smaller, more atmospheric touches matter just as much. Like the usage of Michael Abels' score for example. The songs pop up in the most unexpected of ways. Think you'll never listen to I Got 5 on It in the same way again? Try hearing N.W.A's F*ck tha Police without getting chills after this.Us isn't perfect and is nowhere near as focused as Get Out was. Yet, it's another standout work from a man who already proved himself to be one of the best talents in the genre after only one film. His second effort only bolsters that reputation. There's more to find fault with for sure, but that didn't stop from walking out of that theater having had a really good time."

      "text": "An effective socio-political thriller looking at issues of class and privilegeThere's a detail to be found in writer/director Jordan Peele's second feature, Us, which gives you a good idea of the amount of thought that has gone into the film. In the opening scene, set in 1986, a young girl walks into a hall of mirrors, with a sign outside proclaiming \"Find yourself\", and a picture of a Native American above the door. Later in the film, now in the present day, the same hall of mirrors is seen, the same \"Find yourself\" is seen, but now the picture of the Native American has been replaced with a wizard. This change represents a meaningless and superficial attempt to tackle society's discomfort with its violent history, and this, in turn, speaks directly to one of the film's most salient themes - the US (or us) is a country built on violence, racism, and oppression, but as long as such things are swept under the carpet and no one talks about them, then there's no need to worry. Peele very much wants people to start talking about them.The film tells the story of the Wilson family - Adelaide (an astounding Lupita Nyong'o), Gabe (Winston Duke), Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex) - who one night whilst vacationing in Santa Cruz are confronted by their violent doppelg\u00e4ngers.One of the problems with parsing the film is that so many of the socio-political themes are tied to who the doppelg\u00e4ngers are and what they want, that it's difficult to discuss them without spoilers. So, small spoiler ahead - the doppelg\u00e4ngers are called the Tethered; essentially, they are an underground-dwelling race of lookalikes. Through no fault of their own, they are deprived of the opportunities those above the surface have access to. The allegorical dimension couldn't be clearer; the film is a parable about class division. The Wilsons represent a middle-class all-American family; the Tethered represent the underclass, those without access to privileges, despite possessing the same capacity for happiness and success. This similarity is driven home when Adelaide asks Red (her Tethered) who they are, and Red answers (truthfully), \"we're Americans.\"In this sense, the film is very much about marginalisation. And this speaks to perhaps the film's most important point - the destitute and discriminated against can succeed just as much as everyone else if only they're given the opportunity to do so. This is also alluded to in the powerful final shot, which reveals that the Tethered have accomplished something which the surface dwellers once attempted but failed. The Tethered are the ignored, those swept under the rug of society, just like the alteration to the picture above the hall of mirrors. True, the deeper Peele explores the Tethered, the more insurmountable logistical problems are thrown up, and the further he strains credibility. However, this is not as detrimental as it may sound.Even more so than Get Out, Us is aesthetically gorgeous, with Mike Gioulakis's cinematography especially impressive. An illustrative scene features the rare use of a split diopter, a tool favoured by Brian De Palma that allows both foreground and background subjects to stay in focus simultaneously. Using it in a crucial scene towards the end of the film, it is the only time we see Adelaide and Red's faces in the same shot at the same time, with Red shot in BCU, facing away from Adelaide, who stands behind her.In terms of acting, Nyong'o's nuanced work as Adelaide and Red is a clinic in contrasts. Apart from their appearance, nothing about the two is similar; their posture, their facial expressions, how they talk, how they walk, how they react to things around them, how they use their hands. Adelaide, a former ballet dancer, is graceful and elegant, whereas Red is automaton-like, her movements almost staccato.As for problems, there are a few. Aside from the insurmountable practical issues with the Tethered, my biggest issue was that every time the Tethered want to kill someone, they do so immediately. However, they pass up multiple opportunities to kill the Wilsons, which is an irritating inconsistency. Additionally, the final twist doesn't really work, feeling like something of a twist for twist's sake that was never fully integrated into the narrative.These small problems notwithstanding, Us is an impressive film that improves on Get Out in almost every way, and which serves as a more complete artistic statement. The Tethers are monsters because they have been left with little choice other than to become monsters, imprisoned by a system they had no part in creating and in which they are not allowed to participate. In Get Out, Peele took a story of bodily possession and moulded it into a story of black/white relations. In Us, he demonstrates that oppression can easily cross racial boundaries. And the real horror of this is to be found in humanity's inhumanity to one another."

      "text": "I really admire Jordan Peele because he is a comedic genius, a really intelligent guy and also a horror movie master. With 'Get Out' Jordan Peele had us talking non-stop about his movie, first because it was a really freaky and well-made 'horror' film by a comedian, but also because it was a really good movie. Following his global, critical, and Oscar-winning success that was 'Get Out,' it's hard to make a movie that would top his previous work, or even come close. That is the case with 'Us'. While 'Us' is still a really great piece of work from Jordan Peele, it is still clear that 'Get Out' is the better movie, mainly because of the concept, the plot, the twists, and the depth. 'Us' is a really creepy, well-done horror movie that more fits in the horror category than 'Get Out' does. It has scary scenes, jump scares, brutal deaths, a killer soundtrack, twists, and an overall terrifying concept. Spoiler: the concept of clones of yourself living beneath you that most of the time mimic your actions and one day come out to kill you so they don't have to mimic you anymore is kinda terrifying, especially with the way they look, move, and menacingly walk towards you then eventually stab you with scissors. We find out that everyone, not just the Wilsons family, has a \"tethered clone\" that is out to kill them when the tethered rise from the underground and kill their human forms. As the tethered people rise and brutally kill everyone they form a chain that is supposed to be \"Hands Across America\" which doesn't really make sense but it's still pretty creepy. I would say that once this movie steps back into reality it kinda loses its whole groove. This is because the movie, especially when the mysterious deaths of random people appear, and when the first family of tethered people attacks the Wilsons, 'Us' is really intense, scary, and has you on the edge of your seat, but in addition to that you know you're going to find out what it's all about. Once the story finishes the brutal killings of the tethered to most of the humans in America we assume, they start revealing backstory, explaining everything in a messy manner. First of all, when the family is out to kill the tethered people of themselves and their friend's family, it's totally awesome. The action is great, and it's enjoyable. Then once the climax and third act has begun the movie starts to explain every single bit of detail. The only tethered person that can speak, who is Lupita Nyong'o's tether, she explains it all to Lupita Nyong'o's main character. We find out that she has been planning this attack for 20 years ever since she encountered her at the hall of mirrors in 1986, but also how there are millions of people beneath the ground that are mimicking everyone's actions up above. Also earlier in the movie she explains how she was forced to do everything that her human self had done, have children with Winston Duke's character and give birth to two kids, two which she did not want to have. Pretty much she's suffered a lot, which is why the tethered are out to kill everyone. They have suffered enough. I think the whole idea is that Jordan Peele wanted to point out the privileges in everyone no matter what race you are but just being an American you have lots of privileges. In the end there are about 3 twists in like the last few minutes, leaving many unanswered questions, but for me the biggest plot hole was why sometimes the tethered mimic their actions up above but sometimes they didn't. There are scenes where they look straight at each other and mimic them but other scenes where they don't. I don't know if Jordan Peele left some plot holes as big as swiss cheese in the story or if he's just going to explain it all in the possible \"universe\" he has planned for us. I'm not sure. Overall, Us is actually a really good movie because it has stuck with me ever since I saw it and really has me thinking, while it has many plot holes."

      "text": "Us is monumental for the horror genre, a piece of film making that understands itself down to the cells in its core. It\u2019s bigger than anything we\u2019ve seen the genre do for a long time, and inarguably not as universally pleasing as Peele\u2019s prior feature. And yet, this is what makes Us such an immensely satisfying work. This is a fresh-faced director returning from an unmitigated triumph, proving to us he has more complex, challenging ideas behind him. Us lacks the surprise of Get Out, but makes up for it by being a denser, more ambitious feature. Comparing the two already feels like a losing battle. With Get Out, Peele showed up in this world and knocked us for six. With Us, he\u2019s proved that he\u2019s here to stay."
