Very soon after they regret playing the prank. The truck driver is insane and makes their lives a living hell.\rWhat makes Joy Ride, late Paul Walker's best film is that it's a fun thriller heightened by chilling voice work by Ted Levine (Silence of the Lambs) as the truck driver. Walker impersonating a woman named Candy Cane on the CB radio which starts everything, is pretty funny. I'm not sure how anyone would believe he was a lady."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "It was trilling, but something was missing. The part including the bus following them and almost not ending up killing them got me like \"oh nonononon.. That was close....\" The end was really well made. Overall I would recommend it."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Watched this movie as a sneak preview in theatres and discussed with the rest of my group to walk out half way. Managed to stay until the end just to see what would happen, but the movie didn't redeem itself.

The movie unraveled, with hills and valleys, pretty well until the end.  For some reason this movie got my adrenaline going and then I fell a little flat.  I had to ask myself if 5 minutes of the film was strong enough to disappoint me after watching the previous hour and a half?  I think, yes."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Doesn't really make any sense but possibly a class above most horror films."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This is the greatest movie of the century!
