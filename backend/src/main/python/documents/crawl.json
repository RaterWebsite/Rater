Also in the crawl space with them are several alligators. Needless to say, people are eaten alive in the rising water. However, it's not with excessive gory detail, but just enough brutality to make it distressing. Although the duo's multiple injuries strain credulity, their fight for survival is tense and exciting. This doesn't break any new ground for the genre, but it sure does entertain with several good jump scares and plenty of bloody reptilian thrills. Interestingly, shot entirely in Serbia."

It was constantly unrealistic looking and couldn't really scare me even though I have a great fear of alligators. The jump scares in this movie are horrendous. I went to go see this movie with my friends who are all terrified by horror movies and they didn't get scared once or ever jump at the jump scares. We were laughing more than we were in fear. The characters also are some of the dumbest characters in horror history of all time. They're constantly doing the last thing you would ever do in a horror movie. I get that's the trope of the horror genre but if they were a bit smart I think it would've added to the fear factor knowing that even though they were smart the alligators could outsmart them. Finally, the plot points and what happens during the movie is really dumb. Everything that could go wrong happens, nothing ever works for the characters. Couple that with inconsistent moments in the movie like, \"The alligators hunt by splashes in the water\". While earlier in the movie the characters weren't splashing and the alligators hunted them anyways. This was just a genuinely bad horror movie that isn't scary, looks terrible and is very inconsistent."

Doesn\u2019t seem like the kind of movie that would get high critical praise, but here we are. What did I think of it? While this movie is very stupid with some very cheesy and unrealistic moments and a ton of stuff that doesn\u2019t make sense, I enjoyed it. Much like Brightburn, this movie has a big director attached to it as a producer, Sam Raimi. This movie does feel kind of Evil Dead-ish, it\u2019s about people in an isolated location with a creepy basement trying to survive, but it\u2019s not nearly as good. Honestly, I really don\u2019t have much to say about this movie. This movie doesn\u2019t overstay its welcome and it succeeds at precisely what it sets out to do, just be entertaining. It doesn\u2019t really try to be anything more. I can\u2019t really fault the movie for that. As for my recommendation, does a killer alligator movie sound appealing to you? If yes, give it a watch. It\u2019s really short. It\u2019s under 90 minutes. You don\u2019t have much to lose. Just turn off your brain and have fun. If not, you are not going to enjoy this movie."

I didn\u2019t exactly expect a whole lot from Crawl and you shouldn\u2019t either, as long as it\u2019s entertaining then it\u2019s a job well done and what more can you ask? We\u2019re never going to get another Jaws standard movie so go in with low expectations, try not to pay too much attention to the script and I promise you won\u2019t be disappointed.Crawl delivers on the one thing that matters, it won\u2019t bore you and it\u2019s not trying to be anything more than an average thriller. This film wastes absolutely no time getting started and gets straight to the violent chomping. It lays on the tension and keeps the frights coming and coming. I like a good monster movie I mean who doesn\u2019t and Crawl is your typical entertaining thriller you can enjoy and then immediately forget once you leave the cinema. These movies always find their audience and normally do well at the box office. Two actors I\u2019ve never heard of and some CGI alligators won\u2019t break the bank so don\u2019t be shocked if we get a Crawl 2 in a couple of years. It\u2019s a hell of a lot better than The Meg but doesn\u2019t come close to being anywhere near Jaws. Recommended for those of you who enjoyed Lake Placid or The Shallows."

      "text": "Crawl is surprisingly a decent monster movie. Here are the negatives. The visual effects suck. The alligators look like they came out of a Playstation 2 game and it is kinda distracting. Barry Pepper\u2019s acting was really inconsistent. At the beginning of the film, he wasn\u2019t trying at all and his acting was pretty bad but as the film progressed, it did get better. Towards the end of the film, some of the action scenes start to get repetitive. The main character will get out of a fight with an alligator into another fight with an alligator. Another issue would be that some of the characters kinda walk off major injuries. One of the characters has a broken leg but seems to walk it off later on. My main issue is that the characters make some pretty dumb decisions. They are multiple moments where the characters could make an escape but they don\u2019t. One such scene is when one of the characters finds a shovel and instead of using it to knock out a weak wall, they decide to attract the attention of the alligators. That problem does take away from the experience of the film a little bit. Here are the positives. Kaya Scodelario does a great job as the main character. You feel for her and what she is trying to do, which is save her Dad. She does a great job at finding different and creative ways to fight off the alligators. The production design for this film is really good. The sets are pretty cool. The basement set makes you feel claustrophobic while the water fills in. The film knows how to build tension really well. The film always present this sense of danger throughout the entire scene until the last act. The beginning scene with the gators is incredibly tense. They set up the fact that the gator is in the basement and you just have to wait till they reveal it to the characters. The film is incredibly gory also. You do see people\u2019s bones sticking out of their body and you do see a gator rip a guys head off and it\u2019s incredibly intense to watch. They also make the smart decision to not use music in these tense scenes so that it feels real. The soundtrack is generic but it does have a couple good scores in there. The cinematography is decent for what the film is going for and the tone and pacing are consistent. Overall, Crawl is a decent monster movie with a good protagonist and some great set design but is held back by dumb decisions and crappy visual effects. I give Crawl a 5/10."

The best part of the movie was when one of the aligators threw the human body to another gator. Also, the theme song feels very claustrophobic and anxiety giving which is perfect for this movie.The Bad: This movie is predictable and boring. It lacks a plot, I mean there is some here but it really does have a B-Movie feel. As I said the special effects look really good but there aren't any in the crawl-space in which the movie takes place.The Ugly: Our main character is very inconsistent. She is shown as weak but then shown as a badass but then back to weak. Also, she has the one of the absolute worst catchphrase in cinematic history \"Apex Predator, All Day!\"This movie is mediocre at best and I cannot recommend it. Trust me you've seen it before."

Most of them are done with very minimal budgets and very poor/stupid storytelling and for the most part they don't even come out to the big screen but go straight to DVDs --So it was kind of interesting to see a project that has some of those over the top concepts, like a hurricane that leads a bunch of extremely aggressive alligators into a house where two people are trapped, and see it done with actual decent effects and very decent performances. If anything the fact that it came to theaters already had something to say about it, and I must say that for what it is, it is quite entertaining and suspenseful. It is still a bit silly, considering why the two main characters got trapped there in the first place, but their father/daughter relationship is still believable and it carries the movie way up till its end--which comes quite fast I may say because this is a very short movie. It ends a bit unsatisfactorily, but for what it is worth it was still a decent watch."

      "text": "Given his proficiency with gore Alexandre Aja could have gone the B-movie route with Crawl and still delivered a good time for the people who have enjoyed his previous works. Instead he came out of his box and made a genuinely respectable thriller. The first sign this isn't going to be another Piranha 3D comes from how he takes time to make the protagonist feel like a real, layered human being before putting her through a watery and scaly hell. We learn about her goals, life, and even her personal and familial struggles. All of which define who she is and her behavior for the audience in a believable manner. Personally, I didn't quite care much about this stuff as I was really only here to see people get eaten, but those a little more demanding of their movies will likely appreciate that this isn't straight Lake Placid style schlock.Aja keeps things lean and mean with a brisk 87 minute running-time. A welcome change in pace from the 2+ hour mega-blockbusters that make up the majority of cinema today. Once the first gator appears it's a non-stop series of ever-escalating, yet grounded thrills. The majority of the action takes place in one location and revolves around only a few characters. For all the praise small-scale horror films like this often receive, I've begun to realize how having only a handful of people onscreen can limit the tension in a way. It's hard to get a full sense of danger as we know the main character is going to be mostly fine until maybe the very end of the movie, and the side-characters are usually just there for the body count so they don't get any development. This is a problem Crawl doesn't have as the person who spends the most time beside the protagonist gets just as fleshed out as she does while still only taking on a supporting role. So we end up caring just as much about them as we do her, which keeps the anticipation and dread in each encounter high due to their lack of leading actor protection.Alexandre Aja did everything he could to make Crawl an experience that could be enjoyed by more than just those who typically watch movies about killer reptiles. It's not quite the Jaws of alligator flicks (more like the Don't Breathe), but should succeed at having a wider-reaching appeal than any that have come before it. Plus, in his effort to target more than just a niche audience Aja shows real growth as a director and delivered what's likely his best film to date."

For a majority of the film, you follow Haley and her dad in a crawl space and if you\u2019ve ever been in one you know it\u2019s a small space and despite the small space a lot of stuff goes down. There is very little to no music throughout the entire film which helps keep the viewer on the edge of their seat the entire time. Neither the characters or the audience know where the gators are at any time and it causes for some scenes where people get scared. The acting in this film done by the two leads was well done. Both Kaya Scodelario and Barry Pepper did fantastic jobs with their characters and made them feel like real-life people that you want to see survive till the end. They seem like an actual father-daughter relationship with the ups and downs that come with it. I also just want to say that Haley is a badass and super resourceful. She isn\u2019t afraid to do anything if it means both she and her father will live. But this is where you need to turn off your brain for the film because some logic isn\u2019t followed. In the film, you can see here getting hurt from the gator but no repercussions. With her dad, you seem him hurt and having a hard time to walk but with her, she just shrugs it off and walks just fine. I\u2019m sorry but yeah no you should be limping and or dead cause both of them would have died from blood loss just saying. Also, in my opinion, this film would have worked better as a short film because at times it felt like it was dragging on because they need to make it a full-length feature film. In the end, Crawl actually isn\u2019t that bad and worth watching at a cheap price. I give Crawl a 7.5/10."

On peut regretter qu\u2019au cours de ce film plein d\u2019innondations, l\u2019on ait pas fait appel \u00e0 ce bons vieux requins, lesquels \u00e9taient pourtant partants pour manger un morceau\u2026 ou plusieurs (morceaux) !L\u2019on s\u2019est donc rabattu ici sur quelques crocos, ou plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, vu \u00e7a se passe en Floride, sur des alligators tr\u00e8s retors ! c\u2019est la jolie Kaya Scodelario qui s\u2019y colle et en tant que nageuse \u00e9m\u00e9rite, elle fait la course avec les sacs \u00e0 main. Les effets sp\u00e9ciaux sont bien faits, la r\u00e9alisation reste toujours de bon aloi\u2026 n\u00e9anmoins, on reste sur sa faim et on trouve l\u2019ensemble \u00e0 la fois convenu et timide.Tout cela manque en effet de mordant si je puis dire, et le sc\u00e9nar sent un peu trop le gros navet pas frais qui laisse fortement incr\u00e9dule ; on ne s\u2019ennuie pas, cependant\u2026 ou tr\u00e8s peu. Mais l\u2019h\u00e9ro\u00efne reste \u00e9tonnamment habill\u00e9e pour ce genre de films : m\u00eame pas un petit d\u00e9bardeur ? ou quelques v\u00eatements d\u00e9chir\u00e9s ? non, non, \u00e7a pourrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme sexiste, on vous dit ! ah je vous jure\u2026"

      "text": "Movies should not always be realistic or plausible, that's more than understandable but also in spite of the fact that as a viewer you're looking for a certain type of entertainment you have to know at what moment you draw the line with the absurd; And Crawl is full of absurdities.This film reminds me of ''Don't Breath'' because it appears to me that in the absence of innovation in the genres of horror and suspense, a certain part of the critics are applauding simple plots and praising them as better films than they really are.I will not say that this is a failure because what it offers is enough and will be more than enough for a big part of the audience and that's not bad but it doesn't mean it's a great film either.At the end of the day everything depends on your own taste, it will depend on your own time and your own expectations. Maybe that's how this film will be more rewarding. For my part, there was nothing memorable or extraordinary. It does have certain entertaining elements and also lasts less than 90 minutes so ... well yeah, it's just a regular film."

      "text": "It is a money well spent expenditure, for the makers not exactly for the viewers.CrawlAja understands the script better than anyone. As he should. The director Alexandre Aja is aware of the trajectory that leads these characters and us towards the climax. And it is that ammo of his that he uses at the sign of danger. If the film walks a toddler walk, Aja is pulling tricks left and right to not let it fall or fumble. And it doesn't. The film maintains its productive sensible pace as the elements topple one over another, scaring us using the game of numbers. Yes, it is good to see math involved in a commercial horror film. Let's take the basic setting for example.The plot kicks in after the characters gather up in one location. Now, the makers to elevate the fear of our hosts uses the outnumbered logic to corner them. Being aware of the fact that you are to be drowned by a series of creatures, he isn't revealing this information all at once. That discovery is itself scary. And it is not just that measurement but the amount of water that they are fiddled by like a toy or even various insects crawling over them.These tiny aspects of the genre keeps us engaged and entertained. But now this is where the film gets stuck. For beyond the B grade pop cultural theme, there is no other layer to look for. The crux of the emotional punches is the father and daughter relationship that never communicated with me. When something so vital as this fails to hold on to its promises, the drive or the dive that makes these characters keep jumping or sacrificing or saving is like an empty gun fired across the room for attention. Crawl doesn't crawl literally but it surely does crawl metaphorically; I know that's a cheap shot."

It's predictable, it's laughable at times, and it's not particularly fun to watch. I looked at my watch numerous times to see how much time was left."
