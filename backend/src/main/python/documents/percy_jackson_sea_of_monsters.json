      "text": "Sea of Monsters is both a step forward and a step backward for the franchise. For the film is well acted, well cast, and well directed. The first half of the film tries to be faithful to the book making the story flow, getting in necessary information, and making up for a lot of the errors made in the last film. All of these smart moves make it frustrating when we get to the second half. Luke is reduced to a pathetic and easily beaten villain, the prophecy is poorly explained and handled, the Sea of Monsters is overwhelming despite the build up and title, and the way the climax would be handled it makes you wonder if the filmmakers remember they still have three more books. Nonetheless, this is an improvement over The Lightning Theif giving us something that is more true to the spirit of the book than the predecessor. Don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll get a third film given the poor performance of this film critically and financially but if the franchise keeps improving we may soon get the Percy Jackson film fans want."

What could've gone wrong?\rHence, this list:\r-Story is changed so dramatically that you can't call it an adaptation\r-Many of my favourite characters and scenes are removed. I wanted to see Tantalus so bad.\r-The Polyphemus subplot is shortened from lasting the majority of the book to a 3 minute scene.\r-They screwed up the concept of the mist ENTIRELY and possibly messing up half the series as a result\r-The 'Golden Fleece' looks more like an old tea towel\r-The acting is slightly off\r-Annabeth is STILL a brunette for some reason\r-The Oracle changing '16' to '20' is a prime example as to why you don't cast adults as young teens\r-The ending:\rWhy did we really need a fight with Kronos? And why is he a giant figure rather than a spirit possessing Luke's body? And even then why is he such a pushover? He's the villain of the whole series for gods sake, he's a sodding TITAN. I really wish Percy and Tyson had waited another five seconds for their overly long reunion hug to remove the fleece so we wouldn't even have to endure the hacksaw being taken to the story.\r Then again, they probably weren't that confident they'd get Titan's Curse, so decided to wrap up the story but at the same time keep it going just in case. Which is slightly ironic because this massive change may be what pissed off fans, getting the film negative reviews such as this, and getting the third film cancelled.\r I can say this for most sequels: 'First one's better.'"

The scale is smaller, the characters are less interesting, and the film makes poor use of its rich book and Greek mythology source materials. Young movie (and book series) fans will likely find enjoyment in watching their favorite heroes and actors back on the big screen for another Percy Jackson adventure but the movie provides next to nothing for anyone outside of that core demographic. As mentioned, the film spends a significant amount of time planting seeds for the next entry in the series, but it\u2019s hard to imagine that many moviegoers will be as anxious for part three, The Titan\u2019s Curse, after sitting through this Sea of Monsters."

      "text": "Sea of Monsters shows what potential the franchise should have should it continue. It clearly demonstrates how a book adaptation should be: making it its own thing, while staying loyal to the overall plot of the original story, and maintaining continuity with the original film. Although some direction was better in the first film, overall this film feels more satisfying as an adaptation and feels better as a solid movie overall.\r You do not have to see the first film in order to understand this one. Right from the opening scene, through a very clever back story prologue, and voice over from Percy, we get a sense of what is going on in this world and are fully immersed. Percy, played by Logan Lerman, delivers the narration as if he\u2019s telling us a legend, and one cannot help but feel immersed in the goings on. The opening story is intense, but is not too dark compared to how other films such as The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian would have handled it. On that note, the whole film is very family friendly and plays as a light fantasy adventure, that nevertheless has its deep morals integrated in. Using the Prince Caspian example, this film does not go as dark or as intense as that film went, yet it also does not go the opposite way in making it campy. With that being said, there are some weaknesses in the direction of the film. While it does not go down the Batman & Robin campy road, the action of the film feels a little too tame at some parts. It\u2019s still enjoyable, but unfortunately, it just doesn\u2019t feel completely executed to the point that it should be. Its nowhere near bad, but it still could have been better. The action is still fun to watch, but it never gets bloody or as intense as it even was in the first film. It plays out as a fun, clean fantasy, that despite the lack of brutalness, it still feels like one could immerse into doing those things should they be real.\r With regards to continuity from the first film, you will see a much more expanded Camp Half Blood in the film, the home of the main characters, however unlike the Harry Potter films, it doesn\u2019t feel or look as noticeably different. The film feels like a sequel and does make the references to the first film, but still feels like it can stand on its own. While fixing up some cut characters and elements from the first film, the film also introduces the goings on at a natural pace without trying to lamely cover things up and consider earlier introduced things as retcon, which is more than can be said about Harry Potter, which merely puts things in its films without (for the most part) making any sort of real continuity or grounded connection with the other films, choosing instead to make each film stand on its own. Sea of Monsters has both a sequel and stand alone feel to it, which is how films should be. Why should sequels ignore what was previously established in the earlier films? The Harry Potters changed pretty much everything to fit the needs of the story without for the most part thinking of new ways to handle the story elements, in trying to maintain the books justice. While on the note of Harry Potter, one simply cannot compare it to any of the Harry Potters. Yes, there are similarities, but, being the huge Potter fan that I am, I barely thought of Harry while watching this movie. There will always be similarities and comparisons, but is not every movie comparable to another? Even some that people would not even think were similar such as the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy being comparable to the original Star Wars trilogy. And let us not forget the Avatar/Pocahontas/Dances with Wolves or the Iron Man/Dark Knight trilogies similarities. They will always exist, but there will always be one person who has NEVER seen the first film to have the idea, and even some who have seen both ideas and may like the newer one that has the old ideas better because of how it is executed. Its NOT what it is, but HOW it is.\r HOW the movie \u201cfixes\u201d the first film is in the following ways:\r -\tA much more grounded and more better polished script. The first film felt that the script was rushed in and was hopeful to be more than its script. The structure and plot was thin and weak, and didn\u2019t feel as immersed as this film does. This film feels like they really revised and mapped out what they wanted from the script instead of just seemingly writing the script over night without revisions. You get the sense that the film makers are passionate to get the writing right and make it make sense and enjoyable for those that haven\u2019t even seen the first film.\r-\tPercy\u2019s friend Grover (played by Brandon T. Jackson), is not annoying in this film like he was in the first film. This time he is more mature, yet still retains his comic characteristics.\r-\tThe world is populated with many characters. Unlike the first, where there were merely just cameoized characters, and small things hidden in the real this one feels more like there actually is a hidden universe."

      "text": "This review was originally posted on www.Pixcelation.com by Andrew Korkmas.\r \u2026Don\u2019t give me that look. Let me begin by telling you a story: my cousin once came to visit me and his brother, back when we were in college for a weekend. Being freshman, we were risk takers and didn\u2019t always have the best of judgment. So one night, while some of us were out partying, the rest of us decided to go to the local cinema. Several apparently wanted to see a movie called \u201cPercy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief.\u201d Many of us had never heard of said movie but we didn\u2019t really have any other plans so off to the theaters it was in the world\u2019s most uncomfortable car ride ever (only one of us had a car. It was a small sports car. There were six of us.) While the movie was nothing exceptional in the slightest, the majority of us did enjoy it. Well, said cousin came to visit me this weekend and when the two of us decided to see a movie, we noticed that the premiere of \u201cPercy Jackson: Sea of Monsters\u201d was tonight and decided to give it a shot. Now, let the record show, I went in with zero hopes and expectations for the movie, and in that way, the new Percy Jackson didn\u2019t disappoint.\r The story follows the events of Percy Jackson, son of Poseidon. This time around, he and his team of half-bloods (sons and daughters of the different Gods of Greek mythology) must uncover the Golden Fleece in order to thwart the sinister attempt of Luke, the half-blood son of Hermes, from reviving the titan Kronos which would lead to the death of the Gods and the rest of world. The plot itself is nothing spectacular. My cousin and I joked that for the first one, we both had the entire plot predicted within the first forty-five minutes. That being said, if you are a fan of Greek mythology (which means you\u2019re part of the target audience) then it\u2019s easy to predict because you know the mythos. What\u2019s more, you shouldn\u2019t really care because you\u2019ll be enjoying catching all the references.\r The acting\u2026.well, it\u2019s also exactly what you\u2019d expect. Most of the actors try but none seem to give a memorable performance in the slightest. Logan Lerman (Percy Jackson) and Jake Abel (Luke) in particular seem to give a rather exhausted effort. It\u2019s as if they\u2019re both chronic insomniacs who don\u2019t seem to have much energy to give in their scenes.\r The special effects are pretty good. Most of the creatures look nice and while I didn\u2019t see it in 3D, I could see it being the kind of movie that works well in the extra dimension.\r The directing is a surprise in that it\u2019s actually fairly good. Not award-winning material mind you but it\u2019s still nice and at times clever. Oddly enough, it might be one of the movie\u2019s better qualities. Thus, this aids the action set-pieces which are also not half-bad either, which in turn is aided by the good CG.\r One thing that was of minor annoyance was the ending. I won\u2019t spoil it but I will say that it leaves something major unanswered in an obvious attempt at another sequel.\r \u201cPercy Jackson: Sea of Monsters\u201d is by no means a terrific flick, but I wouldn\u2019t\u2019 say it\u2019s a bad one either. It\u2019s one of those movies where most everything is good enough to the point where they all work together to make for an entertaining experience, even if it\u2019s nothing substantial under further analysis. Sure more time could been spent developing the characters, yeah the plot could been expounded upon, but the movie never set out to be like that, and not every movie deserves to be the next Oscar nominee or cult classic. Some movies are just meant to be enjoyed and ultimately, that\u2019s the kind of feeling I got from it. If you liked the first one then you\u2019ll probably like this one, and if it doesn\u2019t sound like your thing, then don\u2019t bother.\r \u201cPercy Jackson: Sea of Monsters\u201d gets a 7/10"

I wasn't sure whether I was more interested in the movie, or the guy smoking an e-cigarette in the row in front of me. Between the phoned-in, bad acting, and false sense of urgency in the film, I was definitely not a fan. I could tell the story line was meant to be scary and keeping you on the edge of your seat, but it really did not have that effect on the crowd.\r The movie was overly predictable and overall I was just very unimpressed. Also, I could tell that Sea of Monsters was really trying to make an action fantasy (much like Harry Potter) for kids, and just flat out failed. I noticed that Percy never actually used his Riptide sword on humans in the movie. When he would fight, he would hit the person with the butt of the sword so they could keep the film \u201cPG\u201d. I never knew that slashing a human was way too inappropriate for a child! The false sense of danger never worked for me as no one was ever really in danger.\r Overall I was just as bored with Sea of Monsters as the actors, and felt like it wasn't worth my 110 minutes. Wait for it to air on ABC or HBO and watch it then. As the first movie aired like every other week when it was released, you will have no problem catching it. Following the series, when the next movie is made, I really hope they again change directors, and produce a film worth seeing. Read the books and see the movie in your head as imagined by the writer, and you will have a much better experience."

      "text": "Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters surpassed my expectations. Quite often in a film series the film creators will test the boundaries in the second film and I think because the movie didn't seem to test the boundaries it kept true to the book and as a result was just as good as the first movie.\r This film is truer to the book series than the first film was, this is perhaps why many critics are giving it such a hard time having little to no knowledge of the source material and once again judging this as they would judge any random movie. I think perhaps adaptions should get a few bonus points or something when they stick closer to the source, the movie is aimed at fans and kids mainly I'm sure that if they were aiming at a wide audience they would have added a few random explosion scene which would have pleased the more ignorant critics.\r Although the movie was truer to the books it did cut out a few of the more interesting pieces out, I was dismayed to find that they cut Tantalus and the chariot races from the movie as well as the sirens scene which I believe would have both added a lot to the movie.\r Although the movie sticks closer to the books I felt that the transition from the first movie which was less true to the books caused some of the character development to be flawed. In the first film there was a stronger relationship between Percy Jackson and Annabeth Chase however in this film it was explored to a lesser extent as a result of sticking closer to the books.\r The acting just like the first movie was fantastic, the actors do a righteous portrayal of the characters especially that of the main characters. Surprisingly the minor characters are portrayed very well, far better than in the first movie and it makes the movie more engaging as a result. There was a nice addition in one particular scene with Nathan Fillion the renowned star of the cancelled television show Firefly who makes a reference to said show which really resonated with me a fan of that show.\r Just like the first movie the fusion of ancient and modern elements added a sense of fun and adventure which was exacerbated by the journey to the sea of monsters fueling the excitement especially in younger audiences and those like myself who are young at heart. The addition of the Percy Jackson style of humour throughout the movie was alluring especially to fans of the books who were worried that the adaption would get rid of it completely.\r Some have said that the CGI was poor, however I didn't once see any kind of slip up in the quality and there were no fatal missing pieces of scenery as I have sometimes seen in movies with higher budgets than this had. Much of the movie relies on CGI, the final battle scene especially and it is done flawlessly.\r All in all Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters was just as good as the first movie and is especially aimed at the fans of the previous movie and book series. If you are a fan you must watch it, if you are of a younger audience or young at heart it certainly should be on your to do list. Quite a lot of the movie is setting the stage for the next movie which seems may be even better"

The acting was better, the special effects were better, the story was a little more interesting and the movie was more entertaining than the first. The only thing that I felt was worst than in the first, was the characters.The new characters were pretty annoying and unnecessary. Overall, it felt like a more professional movie than the first opus."

      "text": "Good cinematography. Action is alright. The fights are good but not great. Plot is meh. Pretty predictable. The acting is bleh. Mainly whether or not you'll like it will depend on your thoughts on the first one. I liked the first but I didn't think it was spectacular, and my feelings are similar for this one, so I'd suspect if you did like it you too would like this one. Granted, if you didn't like the first I see no reason why this one would be your pick."
