      "text": "This movie is vastly underrated. Kilmer's performance as Doc Holliday is arguably the greatest interpretation of a real western character in the the history of western filmmaking. It's not to be missed. If you haven't seen the movie, watch it! Even if you're not a fan of the genre, this is as entertaining as a movie can be. It doesn't matter if this is not an accurate account of these real men and women. Just enjoy the ride.With an all star cast that delivers, this movie turned many folks who never liked westerns into fans of the genre when it was released.The greatest weakness of the movie is also its greatest strength; Kilmer's Holliday (and Bein's Johnny Ringo to an extent) steal the show from  Russel's Wyatt Earp who is the main protagonist of the film. Powers Booth and a familiar cast of actors take on the roles of the no good \"cowboys\". Sam Elliot, Bill Paxton and the rest of the cast deliver.A fantastic interpretation of the famous Gunfight at the O.K. Corral and all the events that lead up to the fight and what may have transpired after. I can't for the life of me figure out how the critic score for this is a 50?"

      "text": "This is a masterpiece, and the story behind the making of the film is also fascinating.Val Kilmer steals the show, and it's on purpose. Still, he put a lot of effort, and made Doc Holliday fascinating to watch.Highly recommended, even if you're not into westerns."

      "text": "This is a very good character driven western film. It features a good cast, lots of tense moments, good camerawork/cinematography and decent visual effects. There are plenty of action based scenes - fights/shootouts and the like but there are also scenes inbetween that help show the quieter side to different characters nature.It's a little cheesy but its certainly worth seeing, if your a fan of biopics/character driven westerns, so yes I'd recommend it."
