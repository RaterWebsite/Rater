I really liked the first Purge movie. I think the concept is very interesting. However, this one felt like they tried way too hard to make a deeper meaning and emotional connection. Firstly, the characters in this movie are AWFUL. I really, really disliked all of them. They aren't bad people, but they are very fake people. They try to seem sympathetic and take some moral high-road, but it just comes off as staged. I was really hoping about 20 minutes into the film that everyone would die. The \"twist\" to the movie is that the government is now killing people during the purge because citizens aren't doing a good enough job at controlling the population. Why a government would want population control was never elaborated on. Maybe they wanted to decrease their tax base?It's really obvious that this is what is going on from very early on. However, the makers of this movie think their audience is completely stupid and continually threw out \"hints\" about the twist and then in the very end let the government guy have a whole monologue explaining his devious plans. I actually laughed because I was like- DUH! Jeez. I am actually writing this review to try and get the attention of the people who are going to make The Purge 3. Dear whoever you are: if you want to have character development or a story about a specific character stick to one and don't try to give us equal half-stories about 20 of the characters.

The concept undermines law and order and damages society. It implies that there are many (racially/sexually-motivated) suppressed haters in society, waiting desperately for a chance to be free to kill, which is untrue. The rich and well-educated are often very good people in society e.g. the Queen, Richard Branson etc. who would no doubt strongly condemn any such concept and behaviour. The police and law-enforcers are made to look two-faced, which is disgusting. The police devote their lives to justice and do not deserve this sort of portrayal. They should make movies that teach people to be allies in society and make people proud to be allies in society. This movie will make good people angry and may gave them a tension headache!\r The movie is unrealsitic and is, therefore, not scary. The pathetic scriptwriter makes a weak attempt to make it realistic by saying it is 2023 and an annual purging law has been passed (!) How stupid and gullible do the scriptwriters think we are? It is set in the USA - a great multi-cultural country with extremely strong ethics and a strong commitment to improve laws and increase punishment for law-breakers!\r I am a fan of original movies - and the only point 'in favour' of this movie is that I have not seen a movie like this before. I did not see the first movie. However, if they want to make movies like this, the ending must be total destruction of any 'government' who passed the purging 'law' in the first place. The purging should have been totally replaced by stronger law and order and much better justice when laws are broken. If the ending would have been something like that, I would have been happier.

What would you do? How you would you do it? you can quote \"cleanse your soul\". Does murdering really solve anything? These were the questions asked in James DeMonaco's engaging (sometimes thrilling) escapade \"The Purge\" a little film that took the box office by storm. Now, over a year later, it's beginning to feel like \"The Purge\" is becoming an annual gathering.\rCashing in on the low budget .. and hopefully turning this franchise into the next \"Saw\" or \"Paranormal Activity\"). While I can say that the angle on the subject matter changes a tad, and the perspective as whole has transpired into something that, hypothetically, could work at some point. The problem with \"The Purge: Anarchy\" is there is little suspense, too many characters, and dumb cliches that I thought we had outgrown by now.\r Where the original Purge lacked, \"Anarchy\" kind of makes up for (and not by much). The problem with the first Purge was that it didn't know how to categorize itself. Rather showing how else the world purges, it instead focused on one families night of survival (and stupidity). After about the half hour mark, the intriguing premise turned into a home invasion thriller reminiscent of such better made films like \"The Strangers\" and \"You're Next\". Not to mention the only actual crime that film capitalized on was murder. In \"The Purge: Anarchy\" we are not caught up in one family's life, but three. Which evidently becomes tiresome after awhile,It should say something that I didn't really care much to even know there names.\r The film opens with an annual announcement commencing the annual purge, and to thank our founding fathers. We first meet a waitress Eva (Carmen Ejogo) who is desperately trying to make ends meet for her daughter, and sick father. Living in the projects. Next we meet the bitter couple of Shane (Zach Gilford) and Liz (Kiele Sanchez), whom are going through the process of a separation. As fate would have it, there car breaks down on a freeway hours before the purge commences (the trailer presumes the car just dies, however, a gang of thugs wearing crazy porcelain masks.. cuts the gas line). Then lastly we meet the classic father out for revenge, Leo Barns (Frank Grillo) for the death of his son, over a year ago by a drunk driver. You wouldn't ever think these three unlikely groups would ever cross paths in such a huge city, but they do. Leo inadvertently saves Eva and her daughter, and thus become entrapped within the confines of the purge..and now must struggle to indeed \"survive the night\".\r First off, \"The Purge: Anarchy\" started with promise and I had some decent expectations. It looked as though the film would be more manageable, and open than the previous entry. Mainly because were getting into the city, and we are going to see how others purge. Does this happen? not really. Instead of taking a more character driven perspective, the film lags and settles for the same ole political mumbo-jumbo that we don't care about. Adding in some mindless subplot about an army militia, whose sole purpose is to end the Purge. Hence the name \"Anarchy\".\r On the performance side of things, nothing truly stood out to me. The only character, if any, that I actually felt connected with was Leo Barnes aching father figure type role, played here by Frank Grillo. His motives for the purge were actually understandable, plain ole fashion revenge. At least he had some purpose. While others were just relentless, and killed others for no apparent reason. Aside from him, everyone else was just basic or average when it comes to the standards of horror fare. (If you can call this a horror flick).\r I can respect the direction that James DeMonaco takes the film in, rather focusing on just one purge, it tries to introduce several purge's going on at once. The film's conclusion takes elements that made films like \"Hostel\" famous. Which is the more exciting aspect that the film has to offer. DeMonaco needs to write stronger characters, a heroine of sorts..that an audience can root for. Instead of introducing us to five people that make us feel nothing.\r At least with the first Purge, they knew what to do with their characters. There was a certain creepiness that Rhys Wakefield brought to the first purge, playing the smart-ivy league schoolboy with a thirst for killing. . While this time, no character brought chills to my spine. Even the creepy rip-off masks from \"Your Next\" didn't send a shiver, nor a goosebump. I wanted to be engaged, enticed, and enthralled ...and I got neither. Which is truly sad considering how much effort went into making this film. Which, you could obviously tell the budget was a bit bigger and this shows in the action set pieces, which are very well shot. The film ends with \"364 days until the next annual purge\" so another sequel is almost a forgone conclusion.\r Ask anyone that I know, and they will tell you I'm sucker for a bad horror/slasher flick. \"The Purge: Anarchy\" is too messy and can't pick up the pieces from it's interesting and original premise. Instead focusing on the events that actually occur, rather than characters I want to understand and get to know. Perhaps some flashbacks with Leo and his child before he was killed. Maybe if we knew the hardships that Liz and Shane had to go through, we as an audience could somehow relate. But no, we're settled for mindless violence that means nothing. I found enjoyment in the first thirty minutes (roughly). But then much like the original, it takes us away to something much more elusive than it needs to be. I still have hopes for what this franchise can accomplish, because in all honestly the premise is too intriguing. For now, If you're looking for a much better horror tale, stay in and rent \"Your Next\" or \"The Cabin In The Woods\".

With the exception of Grillo's character, I didn't care about anyone else as they were one-dimensional and uninteresting. It really didn't matter to me who lived and who died. Lastly, as our group of survivors went from one safe place to another, strange and outlandish things seemed to always happen. This got old pretty early."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Worst movie EVER. boring and unrealistic it is true big screen crap. very stupid concept with even stupider execution. Feels like the twilight of \u201cWhat if?\u201d scenarios."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "\u201cJust remember all the good the purge does.\u201d\r Some purge for money, some purge for revenge, and some just purge for the fun of it. Whatever it is one is purging for, one can\u2019t help but be drawn to this crazy and maniacally satisfying cinematic story concept.\r Stock brokers hang from the front doors of banks, people are killed for being caught cheating on their spouses, and those with repressed feelings are all questioned as to why they are out on the one night of the year where all crime, including murder, is legal in 2023 America.\r The Purge: Anarchy is story-telling brilliance. Outdoing its predecessor in narrative, character building and spectacle, the sequel reveals the many questions audience members were thinking during The Purge. Such questions include; what happens to people who are caught outside unwillingly on the streets on the scariest \u2018holiday\u2019 in America, what happens to the people who cannot afford to protect themselves the same way the rich can, and just how far are good people willing to go for vengeance?\r Unlike the original Purge, director/writer James DeMonaco decides to do what every good director would have done with a story idea like this, and that is multiple-character narratives that eventually intersect.\r As the evening is coming to an end and the 12 Hour Purge period begins, the world that DeMonaco created does not seem as far away from our own as we are introduced to an array of different relatable characters. Single-mother Eva (Carmen Ejogo) and her daughter Cali (Zo\u00eb Soul) along with her ailing father Rico (John Beasley) are a hard working family. Eva, who works as a waitress at a local diner in the projects of Los Angeles, asks her boss for a raise on the eve of the Sixth Annual Purge that will help with her father\u2019s piling medical bills. Denied, Eva makes her way back home to lock-down her little apartment with very little means of security. Meanwhile, on the other side of town, Shane (Zach Gilford) and Liz (Kiele Sanchez) are having their own problems in their relationship, as well as being following by a gang of anxious masked maniacs who follow them upon learning that their car is stalled on the side of the road due to \u2018accidental\u2019 mechanical problems. Both pairs of people, unprepared and scared of participating in the purge, try to survive the night on their own, until they luckily stumble across the Sergeant (Frank Grillo), a man who is justifying his night by killing the man who took his son away from him.\r Hours before the annual commencement, people flood the streets, searching for last minute \u2018protection\u2019 from their partners, their bosses, their disgruntled family members or friends and say goodbye with the words, \u201cstay safe\u201d. They treat the purge as a holiday; some as a patriotic day of cleansing, others as a religious right of passage. Some call it \u201creleasing the beast\u201d, others refer to it as \u201cenjoying the cleanse\u201d, but one thing becomes clear, it reminds us of the crazy times of the year where people are uninterested in your feelings or concerns, a time that could be compared to the holidays, where the \u2018dog-eat-dog\u2019 attitude of people becomes ever more apparent. Purging could easily be compared to practically every holiday we experience where people are animals on the road and on the streets, but perfectly behaved citizens in their homes and within the walls of church halls and religious centres and perfectly adequate images in social settings.\r I believe DeMonaco has crafted a story idea and made a film that is a lot deeper and more complex than people would like to admit. After all, the film is a free-for-all excuse to have people watch just exactly what people are thinking of doing to others that hurt them, without ever getting their hands dirty. Anarchy really goes with the idea of what people would actually do if that little thought in their head of killing their boss, could actually be materialized in the real world, without any consequences.\r In addition, Anarchy shows the very faint hints of social, racial and economic inequality that is plaguing DeMonaco\u2019s America of the future. Unemployment is less than 5% and poverty is at 1%, and the purge is to thank for this tremendous social statistic, yet, the rich hide and buy their way to an American tradition of cleaning through their heavily-secured houses while the poor help deliver homeless people, hostages found on the street and \u2018martyrs\u2019 who offer up their bodies as a bloddy canvas for rich families while their next of kin receive momentous amounts of money. In any direction you put it, the ones who suffer the most are the poor and lower class, and Anarchy spends most of its time showing this obvious and super disturbing truth of an American society whose idea of \u2018cleansing\u2019 is no different than the idea Adolf Hitler had in the 1930\u2032s."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Definitely better than the first film as it isn't restricted to just a single house for the setting. However, that's the only real improvement this sequel offers. While the bigger setting did allow for more entertainment than the first film, there weren't very many new elements introduced. Sure they tried to throw in some new interesting scenarios here and there, but none of them were particularly memorable. As for the cast, Frank Grillo delivered a rather solid lead performance. The only annoying and unlikable protagonist in this one was Zoe Soul's character. Overall, it managed to entertain while it lasted and easily outdid its predecessor, but it wasn't exactly a game-changer if you know what I mean."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Muy entretenida pelicula. con accion, sangre , gritos  de todo un poco. una pelicula quepodras disfrutar con palomas solo el final si le faltaba o esperaba mas."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "A major improvement on the first purge movie where it is way better, interesting and very intense. Despite also some predictable plot twists all the way through, it deserves credits."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "A hybrid of violent thrill and political message, Anarchy is a refreshingly intelligent horror movie. By drawing the action onto the streets and through a range of environs, the sequel covers most of the wasted potential of its predecessor.  Though a horror, Anarchy avoids tacky, dull torture porn and instead relies upon its multitude of creative villains, superb slow-motion camera pans, tense atmosphere and sudden shocks to make the audience jump.\rThe film\u2019s political message is thinly-veiled: references to the (new) Founding Fathers, love of guns, religion and the connection between these abound. On the streets villains brazenly \u201copen carry\u201d while the ultimate villains hunt their \u201cpurges\u201d in the safety of their mansions.\rRealism does take second place in favour of grotesque caricatures of American gun culture, but this is hardly grounds for criticism of a horror film.\rThe film does have its problems: there is the odd cringe-worthy forced line and there are some noticeable loose-ends, but these do little to upset the film\u2019s neat balance between entertaining thrill and intelligent parody."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "If I could sum this movie up into one word it would be \"Phenomenal\"!!!!! I just finished watching it and I will first say that I loved the first movie a lot but the sequel kicked everything into gear 100% more then the original. The story was better it focused on five individuals coming together to survive the night and being centered on Frank Grillo as \"Sergeant\". The action was Top-Notch with Tons and Tons of violence which I absolutely love. I must add that them taking the movie to the streets did it wonders and I don't ever jump in movies but there were one or two jump scares. The acting was very good but obviously the star was Frank Grillo who kicked Ass in acting and just being Awesome. I will say overall that this is a must see movie especially if you liked or loved the original then go see it Immediately and you will not be disappointed I promise you that. The best horror/thriller movie I have seen in a long long while."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This movie was much better than the first. I don't understand why its getting as much hate as it is. Don't get me wrong, The Purge: Anarchy is far from amazing but it deserves more credit. This is what the original Purge should have been like. If you liked the concept in the first but hated the movie, I recommend seeing this."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "The Purge: Anarchy may not be amazing, but it's a huge step up from the first movie. The Purge: Anarchy focuses on 5 characters. The first two are a couple named Shane and Liz who are driving to one of their sister's house in Los Angeles to wait out the Purge when their car is sabotaged and breaks down in the downtown area.  Meanwhile, police sergeant Leo Barnes goes out into the streets to get revenge on the man who killed his son. The last two are a mother and daughter, Eva and Cali, who are rescued by Leo after a group of men breaks into their house and attempts to kidnap them. The five people meet up and attempt to survive the night together. The concept of this movie is great, meanwhile the movie itself doesn't execute it as well as it should. The plot is pretty interesting including a lot more thrill than the first movie. The people purging are more exciting and although it doesn't give a lasting scare, this movie still does have some good jump scares. If you liked the first Purge movie or thought it was okay you will enjoy this movie. Don't expect too much, but the concept and the plot of this movie are very interesting to watch."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Thank god, this film, unlike the first atrocity, captures what the purge actually is and keeps you ready.
