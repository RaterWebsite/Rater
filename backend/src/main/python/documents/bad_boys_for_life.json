If you liked the first two Bad Boys movies, you'll love this one. This movie is also very self-aware. You're watching two men- One who has embraced his new point in life, and another who is struggling with the fact that he's not the same as he was when we saw him 20 years ago. A lot of the jokes land. There were times that the entire theater was laughing. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are back in form. It was an extremely entertaining movie. Was it perfect? No, but I wasn't looking for perfection. I was looking to be entertained on a Sunday night, and I was entertained for a solid 2 hours. It was well worth the money."

This already the best blockbuster of the year. The movie is thoroughly entertaining. Nobody goes to watch these kind of films for a deep story, they want to be entertained and this film does that very well. Bad Boys For Life is a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and plays to its strengths. It is the best movie of this franchise and downright hilarious. The comedy in this film is perfect, never too much and the timing is always just right. Great film and highly recommended."

Also loved some side characters like Rita especially and want to see her again in the next part if it happens. And yeah it is a popcorn flick but it is a good one. There are some emotional punches which lands beautifully in the film and keeps the film more compelling than the Michael Bay's take on this fanchrise.The villain has the weakest arc in the whole movie and didn't care about that character at all. Even though the film stumbles on some narrative points, clunky storytelling and an anti-climatic ending but it still is better than both the predecessor.Grade: BScore: 7.5/10"

      "text": "This installment of \u201cBad Boys\u201d is sassy, silly, sophomoric and sometimes savage.  It\u2019s also the most fun I\u2019ve had at the movies in months.In the hands of Directors Adil and Bilall, who previously partnered on \u201cBlack,\u201d \u201cGangsta\u201d and \u201cBroeders,\u201d this film is a fun mix of formulaic and self-aware.  The plot is quite predictable.  A Mexican drug cartel seeks vengeance on the cops who sent their leader to prison for life.  Mike (Will Smith) is clearly in their sights.  Mike enlists his long-time partner, Marcus (a puffy Martin Lawrence), to help him right wrongs and preserve truth and justice, while engaging in ceaseless, manly banter along the way.  You could drive a truck through the holes in the plot \u2013 or in this case a steel-reinforced urban assault vehicle equipped with computers, GPS and rocket launchers.This is a film that clearly enjoys skewering itself and the whole police genre.  While there is the beleaguered Captain trying to keep Mike in line (an excellent Joe Pantoliano), it\u2019s all over-the- top and played with a self-aware wink and a nod.  The females are bosses and bad-asses (including Vanessa Hudgins, unrecognizable from her time in the \u201cHigh School Musical\u201d series), not just objects of desire or damsels in distress.  There\u2019s a hunky male cop (Alexander Ludwig) who seeks to avoid violence and strongly endorses the value of therapy in dealing with life\u2019s inevitable issues.  There are regular demonstrations that technology and brainpower may work better than Mike\u2019s testosterone-driven macho posturing.  And finally, there\u2019s the explicit awareness that our hero is a lot closer to the end of his career than its beginning, despite his protests to the contrary. There\u2019s also a necessary nod to the fact that Mike and Marcus are not the men they were when the series began in 1995.  In fact, Marcus has been enjoying a fully domesticated retirement filled with minivans, baby wipes, grandchildren and a healthy fear of his wife, who seems more imposing than most of the bad guys.The action sequences are generally first rate.  Bombs, car chases, explosions \u2013 check.  The film also includes a searing final scene that offers the best helicopter action since the musical \u201cMiss Saigon.\u201dMost valuable of all, this film is totally self-aware.  There\u2019s even a brief cameo involving Michael Bay, the director of the 1995 and 2003 installments in this franchise, as a benign wedding MC.  This is a franchise that realized it desperately needed a re-boot, then took on the task with intelligence and humor.Most of all, this is a film that adroitly addresses the existential themes of death, eternity \u2026 Oh, come on, already.  Really!?  Just sit back, relax and enjoy the banter, bravado and brio.  There\u2019s plenty to go around."

Uma decis\u00e3o inteligente foi n\u00e3o ter dado aten\u00e7\u00e3o demais para o tema de \"moda antiga vs novos tempos\", se relacionando a tecnologia.

We review together. Stream to Big Screen for life. Welcome back to Stream to big Screen. This week we have the chance to review the long awaited third installment of the Bad Boys movie franchise starring Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. They reprise their roles as Detectives \u201ctrigger/bulletproof\u201d Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett. It\u2019s been 17 years since Bad Boys 2, but these two still know how to tear up Miami. This time they incorporate the help of a new department of the Miami PD, AMMO to make this happen. Let\u2019s see if Bad Boys For Life can live up to its predecessors.Good news or bad news\u2026. bad news first of course. Martin and Will are old. This seems like an obvious statement but at times it jumped off the screen. Martin looks fat, clearly can\u2019t do action scenes anymore, and even his signature voice suffers. Age hasn\u2019t seemed to have affected Will as much, but he\u2019s definitely slowed down. The good news is that the director made this work in their favor. They embrace these actors\u2019 lack of vigor and infused a new cast to assist. And boy do they get busy. In fact, I think this movie will do so well that the 4th installment is a foregone conclusion.Now, speaking of age, this movie has its walk down memory lane, but it isn\u2019t full consumed by it. While homage is paid with old jokes and cast, the director found a way to bring the movie into the present. Thankfully, Bad Boys for Life isn\u2019t simply a nostalgia money grab movie. This movie plays well as a third installment to what could be a continuing series, if they wanted.My only issues with Bad Boys For Life comes with the pacing and some jokes that absolutely flop. This movie starts off too slow and in the end it feels rushed; but then there are points in the middle that seem to linger a bit too long. This is clearly something a viewer can get passed but in these lingering moments it comes with some jokes that do not land. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the cast has some very strong moments of comedy and comic relief, but a few times the jokes missed the mark\u2026. hard. Otherwise, the movie was jammed packed with laughs, action and quality fight scenes.So what can we say \u2013 you know what you\u2019re going to get from our leading duo. Great chemistry, laughs, and action lead viewers to the theaters as usual. Even though they may be getting older and rounder Will and Martin still have some gold left in them and the new cast members help bring the series into the future. Grab a bowl of popcorn, go to a matinee showing and enjoy the ride.HASTA EL FUEGO!*sings poorly* Bad boys bad boys whatcha gonna doooooooo\u2026.."

Primero empezare con los puntos negativoshay un error argumental con la primera pelicula en concreto con lo de el hijo de mike lowrey que las fechas no cuadran con la primera pelicula ya que se dice que ocurre en 1994 y la primera pelicula se rodo sobre esas fechas y mike ya estaba desde hace tiempo en el cuerpo y se conocia con marcus desde el instituto. La villana no se aprovecha  tanto que es la madre del hijo de mike lowrey y la escena del disparo a mike habria sido mejor en torno al final ya que nos pillaria por sorpresa y conseguiria que fuera un momento bastante mas duro de lo que seria al principio del film.Ahora los puntos positivos:En cuanto a la comedia de la pelicula es muy buena y las escenas de accion bastantes decentes. Hay muchos cameos ha personajes de la anterior pelicula como reggie el negro alto mitico en la 2 pelicula que nos hizo reir a todos La empatia que sentimos hacia los personajes por ejemplo con la muerte de personajes como el capitan de policia que sale en las tres peliculas es una escena que se empatiza muy bien y sientes que lo ehcas en falta toda la pelicula sin llegar a ser un defecto sino algo positivo.como la vida de mike lowrey se va echando encima y su ira al ver como en poco tiempo pierde a la gente que esta a su lado, los efectos especiales lucen bastante bien en la pelicula y en resumenEs una buena pelicula que si te gusta el cine de accion no hay que dudar en ver esta pelicula esta hecha para disfrutar y ya esta no es una pelicula profunda sino que es una para disfrutar y si os gusta el cine de accion o la comedia esta pelicula es para vosotros"
