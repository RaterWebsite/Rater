This movie is fun and great for you watch with family it teaches us a great way to see life, ups and downs.

With kids ranging in age from 2-23, it was refreshing to find a movie we could all watch and enjoy together. It was so well done. The music was even catchy. The older Christian songs intertwined brought back memories for my husband and me. Even our 6 and 8 year old sons have wanted to watch it again and again, as well as our 15 and 21 year old daughters. I think we all had smiles on our faces as we watched. I even caught my 17 year old son chuckling and smiling throughout the movie. Way to go, Netflix!"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "The songs capture an entire genre of music. The Christian camp experience can feel like a musical, so it is such a clever style for this movie that can really show off some of the greatest hits of the genre"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I love this movie!!
