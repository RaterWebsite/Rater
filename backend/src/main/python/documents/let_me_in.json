      "text": "I've seen the Let The Right One In and I have to admit that it was more artistic but Let Me In was an improvement from the original one. Matt Reeves did a really good job, the pacing of Let Me In is definitely way better than LTROI. It's practically a shot-to-shot remake, it follows the LTROI very closely and the scenes that was replaced only serves to improve the movie (the \"father\" getting caught scene). Chloe Grace Moretz handles Abby very well, she's very mature compared to girls far older than her, Miley Cyrus in The Last Song comes to mind. She might not be as creepy as Eli but when she turns, my God she turns. She's going to have a bright future and her casting was a brilliant one. Another important point, Let Me In sheds light on what was very unclear in the Swedish version, which was \"the father\" character, it was finally revealed to us that he was actually Abby's \"former Owen\", it really adds some weight to the ending. It was satisfying to know Owen and Abby's fate after all they've been through, (pity Owen in a couple of decades). Matt Reeves didn't really hold back on the gore, lots of blood, added suspense, it was Americanized in a good way. I love it that Abby and Owen were attracted to each other because both are really outsiders and how they built a world of their own in the midst of everything that's going on around them, though to be fair most of the commotion was caused by Abby in the first place. An excellent movie which takes it's own time, and great things do take time."

This is NOT a classic vampire flick, but a classy tale about loneliness and isolation. A 12-year-old boy is bullied at school and desolate at home, until he meets the new girl next door. Their relationship forms the story's emotional center, but the fact that she's a vampire complicates matters. There are haunting images and moments of intense, bloody attack (and one amazing car wreck), but the tender core of the film elevates it to well-crafted cinema. Never really scary, but powerful just the same."

I personally liked the part when he finds out that Abby's dad wasn't really her dad after he saw the old photograph of the man at a young age next to her. It was a nice combination of fantasy and real life, the bullies were a key role for the movie, and during the scene when the main bully's older brother is picking on him in front of everyone, it brings a certain human feeling to the overall characters. I recommend watching!"

I admired how much attention was paid to the connection between the pre-teen leads and their bond with each other. I never thought I would ever see a \"horror\" film that would make me look at it as a beautiful romance hidden within....yet also, keep me on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next.The picture and audio quality for the Blu-ray were both flawless and I also appreciated the abundant special-features presented on the disc. It is rare that I give repeat viewings for films in such close proximity but with this film I discover something new every time that I didn't catch in the previous viewing. Exhilarating, yet very touching from start to finish and worthy of anyone's collection.Note: I still to this day have not seen the Swedish version from which this was inspired from, so that may have eliminated any critical bias going into this film. My opinion is based on \"this\" film, and this film alone."

Bringing the same elements with some modifications, we have the new lonely and persecuted Owen by fellow high school. By the way those scenes were great. And the new Abby, interpreted by adorable Chloe Moretz, who I adore, could fulfill the role and show us the reclusive vampire trapped forever in the body of a child under 12. I loved their scenes, but couldn't how not to remembering the original, more quaint and charming. I think the scenes with special effects weren't very pleasing, but it comes as a differential for those who like. Had something like that in Swedish version? I don't remember. So that's it. As much as remakes are made for the sole purpose of making money on something that was successful. \"Let Me In\", stands out as a film well done, and it deserves to be seen and appreciated. Enjoy the new version, it is great."

      "text": "It's a truly rare thing indeed when a remake not only equals, but very nearly betters its original. Matt Reeves manages to preserve the atmosphere and tone of Let The Right One In but also puts his own creative stamp on proceedings, yet again proving his great sense for maintaining tension and momentum so ably demonstrated in Cloverfield. All performances are top notch, with Smit-McPhee and Moretz taking the two pre-teen leads of the original film in a new direction. While Moretz's Abby may not be quite as creepy as Eli in the original, her chemistry with Smit-McPhee lights up the screen. The real acting highlight though, is Jenkins, who gives the character of Abby's guardian real emotion and understandable motivations for his killing spree - you are almost willing him not to be caught in the scene where he is hiding in a potential victim's car. The story is more fluid and engaging than Let the Right One In, and the effects more polished, which will Let Me In a more appealing prospect to some. Others, however, may miss the originality and rawness of LTROI. Whatever your view on whether it needed to be remade merely 2 years later, Let Me In has both respect for the achievements of  its predecessor, but also manages to take the tale in a new direction, an extreme rarity with film remakes."

Their individual needs do not, however, lessen the impact of their legitimate feelings for each other. It is a splendid movie well worth the remake of the original.\rBoth young actors are terrific.

I have seen both movies (actually, I own both movies) but I think this version does a better job with the story. The two stars are much more talented and the overall supporting cast of this version is a little stronger. This claim has not been made lightly nor am I bigoted against foreign language films (I own many). Here are a few specific examples of why I think Matt Reeve's version is better:-The \"police detective\" storyline made more sense than the \"drinking buddy\" storyline and you have more empathy for the cop than the abusive drunk. -The final apartment scenes are written much better in this version. You know how the boy got there, how she is found, and what brought \"the outsider\" in made more sense. -While the emotional connection with the \"father\" was not written quite as well (but still very good) in the apartment scenes, this version does a better job conveying the mutual love and sacrifice through the hospital scene. -The way the \"father's role\" was conveyed in this version was much better. Showing the planning and success of the first hunt was critical in the acceptance of this character.To each his own I suppose but I do not casually dismiss a film because the idea has been done before, especially if it is done better."

After all, the old saying is that if it's not broken, don't fix it, and Tomas Aldredson's \"Let The Right One In\" is as far from broken as it gets.  However, in this particular case, everything turned out just fine. Matt Reeves(Cloverfield) has really done an excellent job of staying true to the original while putting his own little spin on the story.  The setting is slightly different, going from a Swedish town to a New Mexican suburb but it all still feels very familiar to fans of the first one.  The mood is excellent as it manages to convey a wide range of emotions from sympathy to fear and everything in between.  This mood is accompanied perfectly by the outstanding orchestral score that again, feels very familiar.\r But at it's heart, Let Me In is about the characters.  When we first introduced to Eli and Oskar in the original we fell in love with them and the idea of duplicating those characters seemed frightening.  I'm here to tell you that Owen and Abby do their Swedish counterparts proud.  This is, in large part, due to the fantastic acting jobs done by Kodi Smit-Mcphee(The Road) and Chloe Grace Moretz(Kick Ass).  They manage hold true to the character but both add a level of charm that perhaps had not been seen before.  Elias Koteas and Richard Jenkins round out what turned out to be a very strong cast with seemingly no week links.\r No matter what title you go by or what language you speak this is a story that everyone should experience.  Unlike the fanboy(girl) driven vampire films of late this is one that can really affect you.  These are characters that you will care about and a story that you will want to see to the end.  And if you're a die hard fan of the original like myself, who can't stomach the idea of this remake I urge you to give Let Me In a chance.  It is easily one of the best films of 2010."

      "text": "The chances of remaking a beloved Swedish import such as Tomas Alfredson's \"Lat den ratte komma in\" into an equally good, if not, superior film and entertainment, didn't bode well from the outset, and there's more than adequate historical precedence to back these well-heeded doubts up. Not with our track record, not after what America had done(almost thirty-five years ago, around the time of the Bicentennial) with the vaunted Abba sound, as mad record producers and engineers in a recording studio, reconStructed the Nordic husband and wives' soaring harmonies and propulsive rhythms into the limpest simulation imaginable, reducing the Scandinavian Beatles' musical genius(\"S.O.S.\", anybody?) into something called The Starland Vocal Band. But \"Let Me In\", far from being the vampire genre's \"Waterloo\", is actually an \"After[-dark] Delight\". Not only does \"Lat den ratte komma in\" survive its Americanization, the coming-of-age story about a monster, actually benefits from its alchemization. To the filmmaker's credit, his application of a little American major studio know-how is not the least bit detrimental to the art house approach to the narrative's pacing. It's still methodical; it's just not meanderingly so. \"Let Me In\" shorns up the story by sending the boy's father to the periphery, relegating his role to an unheard voice during the boy's mother's phonecalls. In \"Lat den ratte komma in\", Oskar's visits to the countryside brings the movie to a halt. Like Sean Parker(Justin Timberlake) in David Fincher's \"The Social Network\", the filmmaker knows that the [movie] is here,\" not there, wherever there may be in relationship to Los Alamos, New Mexico. Pueblo, perhaps? When Oskar(Kare Hedebrant) meets Eli(LIna Leandersson) in the original, the boy appears to be not especially well-versed in adult matters, so when the girl, fully nude, crawls into bed with him, following the loss of her Protector(sex partner?), there's very little erotic charge, because the moviegoer assumes that the pre-pubescent child hasn't developed an eye for the female anatomy, as of yet. His American counterpart, on the other hand, is a peeping Tom, who spies on his neighbors with a telescope, and gets more than an eyeful from a couple in the midst of foreplay. He sees breasts; he likes them. Unlike Oskar, who was barely cognizant of sex, Owen(Kodi Smit-McPhee) just isn't ready. While \"Let Me In\" doesn't get into details about the angst involved with being forever twelve like Neil Jordan's \"Interview with the Vampire\" did(the child vampire Claudia, played by Kirsten Dunst, whose hair always reverts back to its doll-like curls after she cuts it), the moviegoer speculates that the woman whom Abby(Chloe Moretz) attacks and nearly kills, was chosen so because of her womanly breasts; breasts that Owen would admire; breasts that she'll never have. \"Let Me In\" feels more like a love story than the Swedish original. The relationship between Oskar and Eli in \"Lat den ratte komma in\" seems platonic, more like brother and sister, because of the boy's sexual naivety. Recognizing that American kids are faster, the filmmaker added that scene of voyeurism to make it feel contemporary, even though, technically, \"Let Me In\" is a period piece. The best improvement to \"Lat den ratte komma in\", the presence of a gun, is quintessentially American, since the gun has no place in the Swedish landscape, in which the gun, of course, belongs to law enforcement, conspicuously missing from the source film. Hypnotized by all that lyrical snow, perhaps, distracted the moviegoer, so enamored with the taut atmospherics of the apartment complex courtyard, from wondering as to why nobody ever called the cops. It's a story contrivance similar to the \"Friday the 13th\" movies, where none of the surviving campers ever thinks to report the homicidal maniac in the hockey mask that's picking them off one by one. Saying The Starland Vocal Band is better than Abba; now that's blasphemy. But saying that \"Let Me In\" is better than \"Lat den ratte komma in\"; now that's just the truth."
