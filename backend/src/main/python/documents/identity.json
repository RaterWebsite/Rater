No doubt. I will call it a masterpiece and rate it with a 10, although in my opinion something very important is not included in the film.. And I will only say, that it's related to the real killings, you will see. But I think the film is genius and we should not crunch. Try to arrange the whole movie from the beginning of the protagonist's life to the day of his supposed ending. It's not that simple. You may have some idea about the end of the movie, but you will be surprised, when you begin to look into the details and find out more. But, for sure, you will be satisfied with this movie.~~    Now.. SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!(Only for those, who want to see a different point of view about the whole film after watching it)~    Malcolm Rivers is a killer, who suffers from Dissociative identity disorder, a.k.a multiple personality disorder (he has 11 personalities). His mother was a prostitute, and his father left the family when he was two. Probably then he got his illness. It is not known when he was ill. What is certain, however, is that he committed six killings after he became ill. Michael was captured and arrested for his murders, then sentenced to execution. Michael has worked with his psychiatrist who has established his illness, which had never been known to anyone, and tried to justify it, because there are part of him - different personalities who are not guilty (not committed those 6 killings). So his doctor decided to make a new form of healing, gathering all the personalities in one place and the killer personality being killed by other personalities. What we see in the most part of the film is all 11 personalities trying to survive, because they knew, that the aim is killer personality to die. And here is the misleading part. NOT ONLY ONE personality is a killer, but MORE (Larry, the prostitute, the serial killer and probably Ed, the 'fake policeman' have killed for sure in the real life). Like I said all the personalities want to live. But there is one personality, that wants to kill the others and stay alone - the kid personality (he count them with the motel's keys from 10 like the 10 other personalities). It is accidental, that at the end the doctor dies, as Michael is in a \"trance\", imagining he kills the last personality in his head, but actually kills the doctor in reality.  The most important thing in this film is that not only one personality was a killer, committing murders in real life, like the doctor thought, but most of them were."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "When Ed (John Cusack) shoots Rhodes (Ray Liotta) at the end of the movie, you can see Rhodes mouth the words \"I didn't do this\" and Ed replies \"I know\".

If you have an intriguing premise and a good touch of tasteful twists here and there, I'll ultimately find the movie to be, to some degree, good. \"Identity\" definitely possessed the former, but tricked me with the latter.

The major problem that I have is that each individual characters story line seems to fall out of a soap opera."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "When All or Nothing Is What It Seems.\r In \"Identity,\" which opens today nationwide, a group of strangers find themselves stranded at a ramshackle motel on \u2014 how to put it? \u2014 a dark and stormy night. Like the setting, the characters themselves have the damp, bedraggled air of clich\u00e9. There is a spoiled, has-been actress (Rebecca DeMornay), whose limo driver, a former policeman (John Cusack), has apparently driven in from a French movie, with his dark overcoat and his dog-eared copy of \"Being and Nothingness.\" These two are joined by a creepy desk clerk (John Hawkes), a call girl with a suitcase full of money (Amanda Peet), a nice-looking family (John C. McGinley is the dad), a desperate-seeming young couple (Clea DuVall and William Lee Scott), and a corrections officer (Ray Liotta) transporting a snaggle-toothed criminal (Jake Busey).\r This is an awful lot to keep track of, especially since each of these folks seems to be carrying around a secret. Before long, though, they begin to die off, horribly, one by one, leaving the survivors and the audience to speculate about who the killer, and the next victim, might be. The desperate-seeming young wife has a vague recollection of seeing something similar in a movie once before, though she declines to cite the title, which is either \"And Then There Were None\" or its send-up, \"Murder by Death.\"\r \"Identity,\" a piece of elegant directorial hackwork by James Mangold (\"Girl, Interrupted,\" \"Kate and Leopold\"), goes through its generic paces with enough flair and mystery to keep you moderately entertained. The apparent premise, creaky though it may be, holds ample opportunity for suspense and second-guessing, and Mr. Mangold handles the revelations and reversals of Michael Cooney's script with nerve-racking aplomb. There are horror-film conventions \u2014 eerie sounds, slow camera movements, half-open doors and carefully arranged shadows \u2014 that retain their effectiveness no matter how many times you've seen them before, and Mr. Mangold adds to these a grisly repertory of severed heads and bloody handprints.\r The second-handness of the situation, and of the characters who inhabit it, is explained \u2014 or justified, if you prefer \u2014 by an enormous, gold-plated pretzel of a plot twist that I will not divulge, lest my own head end up in someone's clothes dryer. I should note, however, that the television commercial in which Mr. Cusack is shown in conversation with Alfred Molina comes very close to spoiling the surprise, which is odd since without the surprise the movie would have no reason to exist.\r Whether it has much of a reason to exist with the surprise is another question. Once it is clear you are no longer watching the movie you thought you were watching, there doesn't seem to be much point in going back to the movie that you thought you were watching, which is nonetheless what happens. Still with me? When the revelation comes \u2014 the moment that explains why all these panicky people are running around in the rain miles from anywhere \u2014 it does administer a pleasurable jolt. You think: \"Wow. Cool.\"\r But the impression of cleverness, and the filmmaking dexterity that created it, fades pretty quickly, and you are left thinking: \"What? Wait a minute.\" All of those anxious, obvious characters \u2014 and the game, earnest performances of, especially, Mr. Cusack, Ms. Peet and Mr. Hawkes \u2014 suddenly lose dimension, and they did not have all that much to begin with.\r \"Identity\" is a reasonably well-executed thriller. It suffers not from awkwardness or silliness, which would make it more fun, but rather from its air-brushed, expensive pretentiousness. Like last year's \"Panic Room,\" the springtime box-office success of which Sony may be hoping to repeat, \"Identity\" is a dressed-up B picture, a hunk of cheese trying to sneak into the gourmet food aisle of the supermarket.\r The cheap grubbiness that was always the hallmark of the best horror movies, and that survives in straighforwardly exploitative pictures like the recent \"Final Destination 2,\" is missing from preening high-concept movies like this one and the disastrous \"Dreamcatcher.\" Mr. Mangold acquits himself much better than Lawrence Kasdan did in that nightmare, and \"Identity\" is not terrible by any means, but there is nonetheless something depressing about seeing so many interesting actors stuffed into such an empty, ersatz vehicle."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "60/100\u00a0 It's meh ...\u00a0 Well, I didn't really like it.
