The second was not as good, but it was still decent.  Taken 3 is mediocre at best.  Liam Neeson is fine as the man \"with a specialized set of skills.\"  Forrest Whitaker is good as the Inspector.  They are not the problem, nor are the myriad supporting actors.  The script is the problem.  There are so many ridiculous events and twists going on in this movie that it boggles the mind.  And could this be any cornier?  Methinks not.  Finally, the directing is just terrible.  Where \"Taken 3\" takes its audience is on a pretty dumb ride."

This is very much a by-the-numbers action flick with a hero who's impervious to bullets, falls and anything else that would hurt an ordinary person. The endless chases and fights are shot and edited with that slice-and-dice technique that makes it impossible to see what's really happening\u2026just a blur of activity. In its favor, the pace is brisk."

      "text": "I was excited to hear that the Taken films would become a trilogy, because I had loved Taken (and had watched it so many times I could remember most of its iconic lines). The first Taken was dark, gritty, and very personal for Bryan Mills--his daughter was abducted and was soon going to be prostituted, he had little time to find her, and they were growing apart as she grew older. Taken 2 was not as good as the first one, but respectable in its own right. Taken really felt like standalone story, so Taken 2 detracted from that and kind of felt unnecessary. Nevertheless, I honestly don\u2019t know why people complained so much about Taken 2. Taken 2 expanded well on the characters and furthered themes from Taken. Sure, Taken 2 might\u2019ve seemingly pulled a \u201cHangover 2\u201d move and became a rehashed version of it\u2019s predecessor. But it had some interesting juxtaposition, as Bryan and Murad (father of Marko, who was tortured then killed by Mills in Taken) were both fathers seeking what they viewed as rightful vengeance for actions perpetrated against their offspring. Taken and especially Taken 2 also both had exotic scenery & locations in Europe (Paris in T1and Istanbul in T2), which really helped sell the films.\r Taken 3 probably made a good choice when it decided to NOT have the film\u2019s plot revolve around someone being \u201ctaken\u201d. (How come they never use the word abducted or kidnapped?) However, being set in a typical American city (Los Angeles) and using a pretty generic story (innocent person framed for a crime, must find ones responsible) both didn\u2019t set the odds in Taken 3\u2019s favor. The whole \u201cframed\u201d trope is not a very effective plot device, because *SPOILERS* Stuart (Lenore\u2019s husband) and Oleg Malankov (Stuart\u2019s boss, of a sort) were both involved in Lenore\u2019s murder, not as revenge against Bryan, but because of an unpaid debt between the two (and to get her life insurance money). Lenore was killed as punishment from Oleg Malankov against Stuart. Therefore, there is no real meaningful conflict between Malankov and Bryan, as Bryan was simply involved in the entire mess as a scapegoat (and Malankov is set as a villain far too late into the film). Even though Malankov is supposedly some sort of badass, he is a terrible shot and cannot get a single hit on Bryan. Bryan and Stuart's dynamic happens to be convoluted and unsatisfactory.\r Taken 3 is honestly sub-par and mediocre, especially compared to it's predecessors. I don't even know why Forest Whitaker is in T3; he is such a stereotypical by-the-book cop. I think another actor (Denzel W, Idris E, Samuel L. J) might've been better suited for his role. Unlike Taken 1&2, little time is spent on further developing characters, as the film is very fast-paced. There is action, but it is not very tense or exciting. How are we even supposed to root for Mills to fully kick ass when he's sometimes going up against American cops and possibly endangering civilians? Not to be racist, but it was easy to cheer Mills on as he defeated hordes of evil foreigners. (You could tell from looks who was a bad guy! :P) In chase scenes, shaky camera work truly ruins the fun; they're very choppily and awkwardly edited as well. CGI and big stunt sequences look low budget; Taken 1&2 looked better! The whole film is a half-assed conclusion to the Taken films, with mediocre acting, an uninspired plot, cliche and stereotypical characters (smart person has chess piece & rubberband to fiddle with), \"dues ex machina\" moments, unimpressive and overdone action sequences, etc. I blame Olivier Megatone and the other crew members (screenwriter, camera crew) for the faults of what could've been a satisfying conclusion to the Taken trilogy.\r However, despite everything I said earlier, I cannot deny that some younger (funny cause I am pretty young) and more carefree part of me enjoyed watching Bryan Mills have one last adventure (if indeed this is the last Taken film). I have some fond movie memories of Liam Neeson, and I enjoy most of his films (like Non-Stop in 2014). If you're not as cynical or critical as most movie critics eventually become, you may very well enjoy Taken 3.\r Score: 6.9\r I have reviewed 38 other movies, including the 2014 films: The Interview, Exodus: Gods and Kings, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1, Dracula Untold, The Maze Runner, Nightcrawler, The Equalizer, The Expendables 3, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Guardians of the Galaxy, The Giver, Sharknado 2, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Transformers: Age of Extinction, Edge of Tomorrow, X-Men Days of Future Past, Godzilla, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Divergent, Transcendence, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, and more.\r I review TV shows, such as: The Flash, Arrow (Season 3), Gotham, The Last Ship, Sleepy Hollow, Marvel's Agents of SHIELD (Season 1 and 2), The 100, I Wanna Marry Harry, Crisis, Gang Related, and more. I also have reviewed the mobile Android games Minecraft Pocket Edition, Clash of Clans, and Five Night's at Freddy's."

      "text": "Running out of kidnapped relatives for Liam Neeson\u2019s ex-CIA killing machine to rescue, scribes Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen turn him into a fugitive framed for murder in \u201cTaken 3,\u201d a mind-numbing, crash-bang misfire that abandons chic European capitals for the character\u2019s own backyard.\r In \u201cTaken\u201d (2008), helmed by Pierre Morel, Neeson\u2019s Los Angeles-based Bryan Mills went after Albanian slave traders who kidnapped his 17-year-old daughter in Paris. Made as a low-budget B-movie that sent up U.S. politics and values even as it emulated American genre films, it grossed $227 million worldwide. The sequel, made four years later, reversed the pattern by having the Albanians\u2019 vengeful relatives kidnap Mills and his ex-wife, Lenore (Famke Janssen). Despite the more elaborate action setpieces and heightened casualties, the premise remained just as basic and clear: The shocking way in which the hostages are taken, and the methodical manner in which the retired CIA agent tracked them, generated tremendous excitement.\r Without someone to save, the concept of a race against time is seriously weakened. While family matters were kept short and sweet in the other two installments, \u201cTaken 3\u201d stretches out the kitchen-sink drama endlessly: Mills\u2019 daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace), who was 17 when she was first kidnapped, is now a college student facing serious adult problems. Her dad, however, still believes that, after having hurled a few hand grenades and driven a stolen car through a shower of bullets, she\u2019d still be content to play with a stuffed panda on her birthday.\r Equally troubled is Lenore, who seeks consolation as her marriage to filthy-rich Stuart (Dougray Scott) is on the rocks. The possibility of Lenore and Mills rekindling their relationship is put on hold, however, when he\u2019s forced to go on the run for a crime he didn\u2019t commit. As he said to Lenore in the previous film: \u201cI\u2019ll be OK. It\u2019s the people following me who\u2019re gonna have a problem.\u201d\r Given that Mills walked away Scot-free from double-figure body counts in Europe, watching him evade arrest by Inspector Frank Dotzler (Forest Whitaker) doesn\u2019t yield much in terms of suspense or surprises. Mills describes Dotzler as \u201cvery clever,\u201d though the latter\u2019s theory that anyone who buys warm bagels can\u2019t be a cold-blooded killer ranks among the more illogical police deductions in recent memory. Elsewhere, detecting and blocking each other\u2019s tracking devices is pretty much the extent of their mental sparring.\r One of the series\u2019 talking points has been its extremely negative portrayal of Albanians; \u201cTaken 2\u201d closed on a note suggesting the the blood feud would live on, and it would have made sense here for it to continue here, or for Mills to finally set foot in the hermit country. Alas, those characters have been ditched in favor of Russian mafiosos, who come across as pale imitations of the tattooed fiends in David Cronenberg\u2019s \u201cEastern Promises.\u201d\r What has made the \u201cTaken\u201d franchise such a guilty pleasure so far is its take-no-prisoners stance toward bad guys and its no-holds-barred brutality, especially coming from Neeson, an actor who radiates gravitas and nobility no matter what. Although less graphic in its representation of violence than its predecessors, \u201cTaken 3\u201d retains a gutsy realism in scenes where Mills matter-of-factly cracks bones and splatters brains, and the shoot-\u2019em-ups, car wrecks and explosions are noisier and more bombastic than ever. They\u2019re also unimaginatively choreographed, with zero forward momentum. Even as the scale of each production has increased, the scope of the action has diminished: Compared with scattering hand grenades all over Istanbul, it\u2019s mere child\u2019s play for Mills to blow up a classroom at Kim\u2019s college.\r Without a doubt, the first \u201cTaken\u201d movie gave Neeson, then in his 50s, a new lease on life as an action hero. Now 62, the actor still has an imposing presence, but more often than not, he looks pretty beat and impatient to get things over with. Kim has evolved from an exasperatingly clueless brat to a feisty rescuer over two films, but there isn\u2019t any real progression in character development or in Grace\u2019s performance here.\r Stuart, a slimy wimp as played by Xander Berkeley in the first \u201cTaken,\u201d served as a neat foil for our straight-talking, straight-shooting hero. Replaced here by Scott, he behaves like a badass dude who is supposed to be Mills\u2019 equal in gun-toting prowess; it\u2019s a wholly unconvincing transformation. As Russian mafioso Malankov, Sam Spruell behaves like a cardboard James Bond villain, showing some vicious individuality only in the action scenes."

By this time, the formula has already been worn out, but the makers DONT care about it, they just want the money. And yes, they succeed, becuase all shows were sold out. When everyone watched the movie, 79 percent of them were sleeping and the other percent of the people were talking about Liam Neeson stopping acting altogether. And I have to agree with them because, the story was boring. Not a moment, did Taken 3 fully realize it's potential and kick ass. Even the action scenes lack a sense of joy that should have made this atleast enjoyable. Well, Forest Whitaker gives a solid performance as a by the book cop, and Famke Jessen- well, you'll have to see to find out.

Those who liked the first one, and even second, will definitely love this 3rd and last one. Nice story, not so predictable, good acting. Well, it's a well rounded action movie after all. Haters will hate. Go watch it"

      "text": "Redundancy is strong in \"Taken 3\", an unneeded sequel of the unneeded sequel that while contains a few moments performed by Liam Neeson and Forest Whitaker worth watching, its plot is banal and the action sequences are too frenetically edited to provoke excitement. Some people say that it's better than the second film. Well, that's no large feat. The previous movie sucked, and this one is not an exception.\r Liam Neeson returns as ex-covert operative Bryan Mills, whose long awaited reconciliation with his ex-wife is tragically cut short when she is brutally murdered. Consumed with rage, and framed for the crime, he goes on the run to evade the relentless pursuit of the CIA, FBI and the police. For one last time, Mills must use his \"particular set of skills,\" to track down the real killers, exact his unique brand of justice, and protect the only thing that matters to him now - his daughter.\r Now, the movie opens with some armed guys who work for this veteran operative named Oleg Malankov, basically a generic antagonist whose plan is absurd. After Lenore's husband kills her, Bryan Mills does what he is best at: Goes after them, while also escaping from the cops. The action, just like in the second movie, sucks. Shaky cameras, quick zoom-in and cuts... it's bad and hurt my eyes just by seeing them. Olivier Megaton clearly doesn't understand what made the original Taken a hit. As for the actors, they're fine. Can't say they did \"an extraordinary\" job, but they were okay. Liam Neeson's presence prevents myself from giving a much lower score than this and I like Forest's performance. In fact, I love him as an actor.\r One thing I don't understand is that the police thinks Bryan murdered his ex-wife Lenore, but they don't know he risked his whole life to save her in the previous film (not to mention, he f*cking killed hundreds of people and travelled far to save his daughter in the first film). And suddenly, Stuart is part of some illegal business with a dangerous veteran... whatever.\r \"Taken 3\" reminds me of \"The Next Karate Kid\" and \"A Good Day to Die Hard\", it shouldn't have been made. It shouldn't have been a franchise. It's an obvious cash grab that offers little to the movies aficionado. If you're going to make a movie that serves only to generate cash, at least do it right. Stop wasting audience's time, for God's sake.\r Final Score to Tak3n (God the title is so dumb): 3/10. It was a little enjoyable, but it's diminished by its moronic script, terrible direction and bad action scenes, even if Liam Neeson and the rest of the cast gave everything to make this movie right.\r (Hey, at least the movie wasn't Transformers: Age of Extinction)."

      "text": "Another unnecessary Taken sequel. In an effort to keep things fresh changes were made to the formula. As a result though a lot of what made the first Taken such an enjoyable hit is missing here. The action is more based on big spectacle as opposed to the more believability of the first film. The excellent hand-to-hand fights that were so enjoyable are barely here at all. Instead the majority of the action is composed of a lot of chase scenes (particularly car chases) and shootouts. Explosions are thrown in for good measure. Add in a plot that tries way too hard to be complex and you have a movie that fails to live up to it's predecessors.\r However I would be lying if I said that this third movie isn't still an enjoyable action-thriller. Most of that is due to Neeson. He's still an enjoyable action hero, even if this is the first movie where it looks like his age is getting to him. He doesn't get up quite as fast anymore and takes more hits than we are used to seeing. He's still the guy you don't want to mess with though, and he still sounds great when he's saying intimidating stuff.\r For a while the movie lacks progress in moving it's story forward. It tries to set up some sort of mystery. However it seems the writer(s) knew they didn't really have one here so they decided to keep audiences in the dark for as long as possible by having Neeson just run from cops for a significant portion of the movie rather than going after the bad guys. Neeson's character never even really pieces things together. The whole big picture just sort of falls in his lap and he goes on taking down the bad guys while trying to keep his daughter safe. Not exactly satisfying writing, but it gives us an excuse to watch Neeson go.\r It's nice to see Neeson's old allies get in on some of the action this time. This isn't the Expendables though so don't expect them to go in guns blazing with him, but they play an actual role in helping him as opposed to just being there like in the previous films. However the real ingenuity still comes from Neeson. It's a blast to watch him stay one step ahead of his pursuers the entire time. The actual action isn't anything special, but still manages to entertain.\r All in all this third sequel is a case of good, not great. Well, maybe more like decent. It can be a perfectly entertaining ride for those who come in not expecting too much and wanting to see more Neeson. This biggest issue is basically that this doesn't feel like a \"Taken\" movie at all. The characters are here, but the magic of that first film isn't. Instead what we get is a solid, but not terribly remarkable action-thriller. One that would make for a pretty nice rental, but won't standout among the other action movies you've seen. It's not one I regret watching and I did enjoy it, but I would've appreciated a whole lot more. Thankfully Neeson keeps things going."

Instead what we have is a remake of The Fugitive, well what we really have is a really, really, REALLY bad remake of the Fugitive. Accused of killing his wife, Leeson goes on the run, presumably to his nearest bank to cash his pay cheque, closely followed by Forrest Whittaker. Shameful, lazy filmmaking that treats the audience with the utmost contempt"

However, the reason I liked this one a little better is because the filmmakers decided to try something new rather than having someone get taken again (thank God!) Liam Neeson does what he does best in action films. Overall, I felt that it was a rather rushed but entertaining final film in this somewhat forgettable trilogy of films."

The Taken name doesn't really suit this movie of course because no one is Taken but really in the end the movie was only made to make money. I didn't like the idea to get rid of Framke Janssen at first because she was one of the best characters in the whole series but they did well bringing Forrest Whitaker in, I thought he did a good job in there. I found myself cheering for Whitaker and Liam Neeson at the same time. I really enjoyed the first hour of the film more than the more action packed ending, I thought the drama at the first part of the movie was great and it set up Liam Neeson's motive to save his family yet again. I hope that this is the last Taken film and really it wasn't a bad conclusion."

A common theme with the Taken movies is the action-packed, thrilling scenes. I liked Taken 1 a lot more than Taken 2, but Taken 3 put me at the edge of the seat the entire time! The movie wasn't perfect though. Some things about the movie could have been changed and made better, but overall the movie kept me interested throughout the whole thing with suspense and new plot twists."

      "text": "The neatest thing about Taken, the French-made chase flick that launched the action-star phase of Liam Neeson\u2019s career, is the way it bundles together a whole lot of parental and urban fears, then sublimates them into pummeling action. It\u2019s a movie of relentless and reckless momentum, premised on a middle-age paranoid kook\u2019s worst case scenario.\r Taken 2 tried to one-up the original\u2019s \u201ckidnapped abroad\u201d setup, but ended up producing something that only felt louder, uglier, and a lot less fun. Kudos to Taken 3, then, for at least trying something new. Instead of rescuing a family member from Albanian mobsters in yet another world capital, Bryan Mills\u2014the throat-punching, elbow-chopping ex-CIA operative most people think of as simply \u201cLiam Neeson\u201d\u2014finds himself framed for murder in L.A. It\u2019s a conventional riff on The Fugitive, complete with Forest Whitaker in the Tommy Lee Jones role, but at least it\u2019s tapping into a set of fears and fantasies\u2014about divorce and being replaced by a step-parent\u2014that are distinct from those of the original.\r What makes Mills compelling\u2014aside from Neeson\u2019s performance, naturally\u2014is the fact that his cartoonish over-preparedness and ability to escape from any situation are rooted in anxiety. He\u2019s the perfect father for a kid who\u2019s been kidnapped by armed thugs, but over-protective and awkward otherwise\u2014a fact that Taken 3 underscores when Mills, who can effortlessly elude the best and brightest of the LAPD, slumps over after learning that his now grown-up daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) is pregnant. He\u2019s an invulnerable action hero for the same reasons why he\u2019s a difficult parent and partner.\r So what, exactly, is wrong with Taken 3? A lot of things, most of which can be attributed to the fact that director Olivier Megaton\u2014who also helmed Taken 2\u2014couldn\u2019t mount an action scene if his life depended on it. Pierre Morel, the cinematographer-turned-director behind the original Taken and the parkour flick District B13, at least had the good sense to move the camera with Neeson, playing off of his size and heft to create momentum. Making good on his name, Megaton takes the quantity-over-quality approach, executing a flurry of cuts across as many sloppy angles as possible, producing a gurgling brownish soup of photochemical textures and handheld jitters. This is the sort of movie where it takes a half-dozen shots for a man to jump over a fence. It\u2019s busy, but lacks any sense of movement, and is too visually monotonous to work on an abstract level.\r Because Mills\u2019 hyper-competence never seems exciting, it instead becomes giggle-inducing. While, at this point, co-writers Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen are clearly milking the character\u2019s tendency to speak in super-serious declaratives for intentional laughs (how else can one explain lines like, \u201cI put something in the yogurt to make you nauseous,\u201d and, \u201cI have low blood sugar because I haven\u2019t eaten since yesterday\u201d?), it\u2019s safe to presume that the high point of a sequence where Mills breaks into an LAPD garage isn\u2019t supposed to be the shot of our towering, sixtysomething hero casually sliding out of the trunk of a car. Running a solid reel longer than either of its predecessors and featuring the worst car chase in recent memory, the movie amounts to little more than generic action slop, enlivened only by brief glimmers of intentional and unintentional comedy."
