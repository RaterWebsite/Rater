How Bill Murray wound up in a terrible movie and he would\u2019ve been good as Garfield if there was a good script. Unfortunately, this is a thin story with boring characters that are dully acted. It\u2019s a waste of everyone\u2019s time and I feel bad for all the parents who got dragged by their kids to see this."

      "text": "Woah, this movie gets WAY too much hate. A 27? Believe me, it's a lot better than that. Bill Murray was perfect as Garfield, in fact, his performance as Garfield was the best Garfield performance ever. It's true that John behaved a bit TOO differently from his cartoon self (the original John was a bit of a loveable nut whereas this one is just a bit absent-minded). But Garfield was well captured and it's not like they dumbed it down or anything- like the comic, there are lots of moments where the title character makes a witty comment on something (I.e, after having fallen into a van full of boxes of Lasagna he says \"Once again, my life has been saved by the miracle of lasagna\")  it's a fun movie, much better than they say."

The character of Garfield was terribly made not only because of the effects they used but the performance. And not only Garfield, also all the rest of the cast was so terrible. A movie to be forgotten."

One day the young man who looked after Garfield decided to take Garfield with him to the hospital. When the young man arrived at the hospital he was told to take a dog home with Garfield. When they all arrived home Garfield dislikes the dog that was taken home with him. Garfield was not being kind to the dog.  When the young man looks after the dog Garfield was so angry. So Garfield decided to mess up the home and pushed the shelves and furniture.  The part that I like was when Garfield communicates with his carer and other dog. The film had a great ending."

      "text": "I thought that for a kids movie, its pretty good. I felt that its not really anything to write home about, so to speak, I've seen more imaginative storylines for/in kids movies before but there's nothing really all that bad about it either.It won't really make all Garfield fans happy, for more adult fans like me, you will, if your not aware of the target audience the movie was made aiming for (ie young kids), be a bit disappointed. Its true to say that kids do like Garfield comic strips etc., but they are also popular to older people too, some of the comic strips are really quite witty. I thought that using Bill Murray to voice Garfield was a good choice, you can get a feel for Garfields arrogance through his voice, he voices him well and the dialogue does have some witty points, again nothing all that amazing or really to write home about but still, not bad all the same.With the story being what it is, don't expect something outrageously great, it is a bit thin on the ground and I do feel that perhaps a more interesting or less predictable story could have been devised, to make this a bit better... having said that, I did manage to watch through to the end of the movie, I didn't feel like it was as bad as some kids movies where im completely bored rigid and can't stand to watch any more. Which is impressive considering yes im a fair bit older than the target audience lol but still, as a Garfield fan with a chance to see it for free, why not watch say I?! I do feel that I missed a bit, with my memory of the middle part of the movie a bit fuzzy and now I wonder how some parts of the story made sense but overall I felt it still entertained me as much as could be expected for a kids or family movie. If I had young children, I would have no worries or doubts about putting this on. The only real downside to me was that the story could have been just that bit more, well, interesting or better really... more imaginative. The sequel, a tale of two kitties, interests me more but ill most likely still wait until thats shown on freeview TV again possibly at Christmas before I check that one out lol though I do also feel that perhaps a bit more interesting dialogue could have been added, that might have made it funnier for older audiences to satisfy older Garfield fans. As it was, it was ok, still a somewhat average but decent entertaining movie for kids (a good introduction to Garfield for children) but it maybe could have been better, thats how I feel overall."

      "text": "A family film that barely resembles its source material, Garfield is a bizarre fever dream that I sort of wish never happened.One thing I liked about this film was Bill Murray as the voice of Garfield, I think he was ultimately the best choice to play the fat cat. But he was given very little to work with in the final film, especially since the script is so poorly written. Everything else is a mixed bag, I was mostly indifferent on Garfield's CGI design but it makes little sense for other characters to have completely different appearances - particularly Nermal and Odie. It was odd to see Breckin Meyer and Jennifer Love-Hewitt play both Jon and Liz respectively. They obviously didn't really look into the characters all that much, as they are played as a romantic duo as opposed to the eccentric Jon being a foil for Liz's pessimistic nature. In spite of this, there is very little comedy between the two either. Much of the comedy is displayed through Garfield, which is generally hit or miss. I hated the whole \"Nudge, nudge. Wink, wink.\" attitude whenever it came up, but I admired the slapstick / visual humor as it works quite well for young audiences.I can't really recommend this film for anyone above the age of 7, but it is a remarkably average film for a family viewing. Do with it as you will."
