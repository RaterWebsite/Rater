So we end up with a few odd scenes (amongst all the love-stuff) where Stephen speaks to a room full of people about his theories and then everyone stands up and starts applauding him and how brilliant he is. But, for the unintelligent people in the cinema like me who don't have a clue what he's on about because the movie doesn't provide a single iota of the background work or thoughts then went into these theories, you're left feeling like he may as well have said 'Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah'. And everyone still would have stood up and cheered, because the Movie Director needed a few uplifting moments.\rAnd, boy, does it need those uplifting scenes in amongst the grey, depressing story of a man diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease. Yes, Stephen Hawking has accomplished a great deal in his lifetime so far but so much of this movie focuses on the struggles of his wife, Jane, to cope with looking after him as his condition worsens that the film ends up feeling more informative than entertaining (and what do we go to the cinema/movie theatre for if not to be entertained?)\rMy other issue with the movie is that, especially when you find out that it's based on a book by Jane, it feels distinctly like it glosses over the foibles of his then-wife and yet highlights the flaws of others. Her being unfaithful garners five seconds of screen time but when Elaine (Maxine Peake) shows up later in the movie to help Stephen, she's portrayed as something like a naughty nurse from a 'Carry On' movie who tries (in several scenes) to undermine Jane. It's these things that - especially when considering whose book this movie is based upon - make it feel like it may be a slightly biased version of events.\rHowever, there are positives about the movie that need to be highlighted. There are some greatly funny moments and these are often provided by Stephen's university room-mate Brian (played wonderfully by Harry Lloyd). He brings some much-needed laughter to a sometimes otherwise dreary movie.\rOf course, the main highlight of the film is the performance of Eddie Redmayne as Stephen Hawking. As I write this review, he is Oscar-nominated for it and I would be shocked if he does not win the award. Without such an outstanding job by the leading actor, I feel that 'The Theory of Everything' would have fallen completely flat but his outstanding performance is absolutely spot on.\rOverall, if you're interested in Stephen Hawking then - by all means - you may find 'The Theory of Everything' worth watching. Otherwise, there's not much to be gained here other than seeing a tired, generic love story in a different setting."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "What orbits around Redmayne\u2019s stellar performance sucks the air out of this Hawking\u2019s biopic. Hairdos change, couples swap, time passes- but nothing happens. Until a touching two minute reverse recap at the very end.  Even if love is the answer- the question remains- why is this movie relatively mediocre."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "The Theory of Everything is basically a very conventional love story at its core. Based on the memoir by Jane Hawking it is at first surprising to find how much the screenplay concentrates on her. It is to the credit of Felicity Jones that she becomes the film\u2019s ace card. She truly shines here as Jane and it is almost totally due to her subtly understated performance that the story\u2019s emotions feel honest and not overly manipulated. Eddie Redmayne is also very good, especially with the physicality the role demands, but surprisingly his role seems somewhat underwritten. The screenplay pays scant attention to his professional achievements concentrating instead on his disability and the challenges this posed to the couple\u2019s marriage. Anyone not knowing anything about Stephen Hawking going in to this film would be hard pressed to understand the reverence in which he is held, the tragedy of his physical battles notwithstanding. Ironically, criticism levelled at 'The Imitation Game' and the lack of personal details about Alan Turing's personal life would be more pertinently aimed here at Hawking's professional one.  Montages are adopted to delineate time lines to mixed success, but probably the biggest indication of the film\u2019s failure is due to the fact that one is more interested in the love story between Jane and Jonathan than in the one between Jane and Stephen."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Being a fan of Hawking myself, I was impressed by James Marsh's Hawking flick, with great acting and brilliant screenplay, although some information was a little inaccurate, it is still the only Stephen Hawking film that I have ever seen, so I didn't know what to expect."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Great acting in a good movie: Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones are terrific.  The Theory of Everything is at its best when Stephen Hawking comes down with ALS.  Redmayne's portrayal of Hawking's mighty physical struggle is remarkable.  The chemistry between the two stars is believable and the movie does a very nice job of recreating Cambridge in the early 1960's.  Much of the script is first-rate, but the quick and almost breezy treatment or their marital breakup is unfortunate."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "The Theory of Everything is an intelligent biographical dramady about the life of Stephen and Jane Hawking depicting the struggles and accomplishments they faced together. Everything from the production design and costumes to the cinematography and editing helped accent the emotional struggle of the characters. With Oscar-worthy performances by Redmayne and Jones and brilliant direction by James Marsh the audience is taken on a charmingly humorous and emotional ride through the life of the Hawkings.\r I was a bit disappointed with the story in two aspects. Firstly, I believe that the film was subjected to some restricted narrative construction to appease the still living subjects of the film. In biographies of deceased people the filmmakers tend to push the boundaries and add a bit of controversy or increased tension. If Marsh was going for a more biographical, documentary film than a biographical drama, then he certainly succeeded. However, I feel even with the restrictions that this film delivered. Secondly, I was not pleased with the lack of science in the film. This film is about Stephen Hawking, one of the greatest minds to ever walk this Earth, and yet we are more interested in his personal life? Yes the film is a recount of Stephen's life through the eyes of his ex-wife Jane, but being the only film about Stephen Hawking they could have at least explained some of the interesting theories and research he worked on throughout his life.\r Regardless this film delivers a brilliantly charming biopic about a man whose dynamism was hidden by his overachieving mind. Although Stephen is the star of the film, the true star of the story is Jane whose strength and dedication to Stephen helped bring us The Theory of Everything. His mind changed our world, her love changed his."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "A beautiful movie that revolves around Eddie Redmayne's astonishing performance as Stephen Hawking. When he's younger and healthier, you can see hints of the severely handicapped man he will become ... yet when he's older and frailer, you can still see the wry humor of the college-age wunderkind he was. Some reviewers seem to feel cheated that they didn't get a good enough physics lesson from the film. But I came away convinced that it was that wry, full-of-life humor, portrayed with subtle brilliance, that must have enabled Hawking to survive and achieve so many decades longer than anyone had thought possible."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "I'd never recommend this movie. I'd read that the emphasis would be on Hawking's school life and his romance with his first wife. Unfortunately, that only comprises the first half of the film. The second half is entirely too slow. The sequences of Hawking struggling to pull himself up his staircase - looking at his son at the top of the stairs - mirrored many of the people in our theater struggling to get to the end of this film. Sure, Redmayne is awesome, but when he gets into his \"My Left Foot\" mode, that's no longer acting, in my opinion. I'd much rather award an actor for subtle, true moments - not pretending like he or she is physically disabled. Seems far too easy. Pandering. The movie simply needs editing. And I would have loved to hear more about the Quantum Physics vs. Astro Physics relationship that they merely touch upon."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "\"Theory of Everything\" is, as most people know, the story of Stephen Hawking and his adult life-long battle with a motor deficiency disease (ALS). It is also the story of self-sacrifice and dedication as told through the eyes of his wife of 25 years, Jane, who, together with Anthony McClaren, co authored the screenplay based on her book \"My Life With Stephen\". The film was directed by James Marsh and stars Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones. One must approach this film as both a factual summary of the trials and efforts of a genius confined to the prison of his voiceless and motionless body and, also, as an entertainment vehicle. For the former the film serves its purpose well and is made even more believable by Mr. Redmayne\u2019s remarkable likeness to Mr. Hawkng  and the performances given by both he and Ms. Jones.  As to the latter, the film is certainly not \"entertaining\" in the true sense of the word but represents one of those \"should see\" see films because of its biographical data and the efforts of its two stars. This is indeed a difficult film to rate for much depends on the needs and desires of the viewer and whether he or she considers watching Mr. Redmayne\u2019s character struggle with a catastrophic disability for over 2 hours worth the effort. My experience of the film may well have been affected by the fact that I saw a PBS documentary with the real life Hawkings a few days earlier. That being said, I give the film  a 7 rating because it basically is locked to the actual story of the subjects with little or no poetic license or interest creating insertions.. Remember, though, as with  \"My Left Foot\",also a fairly difficult film to watch, it did earn Danel Day Lewis an Oscar and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the same fate awaited Mr. Redmayne."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "what a piece of crap....i hated this formulaic stupid movie....it was the 'oh my love conquers all' garbage we've seen a million times and then love doesn't conquer all...maybe if they actually made a movie about the dillemma of that real circumstance rather than this inspirational bull hogwash....it ends up not even being inspirational....they don't end up together people....so why this 'ain't love grand....can't it move mountains'....real life set in and love left town...this is a sappy afterschool special only admired because of it's veddy english connection and all that royal academy theatuh tripe and shakespeare babies.....they still have a queen, people...no power ...but they still have one......and the acting does nothing new...nothing fresh....it is nothing more than a boring film with english accents, so of course the academy rewards it because they are pretentious morons who buy into the myth that only the english are true actors....that is not to say there aren't amazing brittish film....28 days later....the long good friday....gregory's girl....educating rita.....billy elliot....billy liar....this sporting life....anything by mike leigh....any monty python.....time bandits.....brazil....trainspotting....anything kubrick....saturday night and sunday morning....don't look now....sammy and rosie.....my beautiful laundrette......hunger.....and so very many more....if redmayne wins it's the academy rewarding the disease and why is jones even in here....so so acting at best....a terrible move....birdman deserves everything....."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "Not been this bored by a movie since watching the Expendables and vowing never to watch one of the sequels.

What makes the movie more interesting is the way of approaching his life, not focused in one aspect, it shows the scientific part, the family part and the illness part. The first one is very impressive, starting by the epiphanies that he experiences, how he developed his theories and how he breaks with current knowledge. The family part gives us a more human image of this genius and his relationship with his wife Jane. And finally, the illness and how the couple deals with it is very well achieved. These last two are unknown for the viewer and James Marsh is not afraid to show the most dramatic episodes making it a heartbreaking story but always realistic. This whole thing goes hand by hand with a breathtaking performances of Eddie Redmayne, it is unbelievable what he has created and Felicity Jones is perfect in her role.

Somehow this extraordinary film avoids this; instead of Hawking's suffering, you see his brilliance, his courage, his humor, his honesty, and oddly his normalcy.  At the end  of the film, I felt not that I'd seen the story of a hero or a victim but of a man--lucky to have a superior mind, unlucky to have a stricken body.

The film focuses on Hawking's relationship through the years with his first wife, and on his theory of black holes and how time works; this may be leaving some parts of his life out, but the man has done so much that the scope of the film suited itself.

Overall, it certainly does great justice to Mr. Hawking and all of his brilliant contributions over the years."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "If the acting tandem of Redmayne and Jones is the film\u2019s irresistible force, then the fading presentation of the story of The Theory of Everything is the immovable object that that force has the unfortunate circumstance to meet.  I don\u2019t know the outcome of a meeting like that in the realm of physics, but in the realm of film, it isn\u2019t pretty."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "A generally well-crafted and engaging biopic about the personal and professional life of world-famous physicist Stephen Hawking. Despite an occasional tendency to be overly earnest in its delivery and some slow pacing in the last half-hour, the picture is an informative and enjoyable time at the show, with a positively stellar performance by Eddie Redmayne in the lead role."}], "recommendations": ["joy", "a_beautiful_mind", "manchester_by_the_sea", "lincoln", "marriage_story", "breakthrough", "catch_me_if_you_can", "scent_of_a_woman", "the_father", "the_danish_girl", "jackie", "the_hurricane", "magnolia", "belfast", "the_devil_all_the_time", "spotlight", "the_secret_life_of_walter_mitty", "a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood", "the_professor_and_the_madman", "nocturnal_animals", "blue_valentine", "bicentennial_man", "steve_jobs", "lovelace", "gifted"]}
