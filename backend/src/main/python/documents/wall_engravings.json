I don't see this as bashing any one group of people based on their weight (...and I love that one person commented on how this movie would offend \"fat people\". Don't you think that some people might find that label offensive?). It does raise some important questions about the amount of time that we spend in front of our computer/screens these days, the lack of time that we spend playing outdoors and interacting with others face to face, and the nature of the \"corporate beasts\" that rule the retail market. More importantly, it's got great music, amazing graphics, and is truly endearing and hilarious. Watch this movie. And then go for a walk with family or friends."

      "text": "WALL-E is probably their biggest gamble yet, but as always, Pixar pulls it off. There is virtually no dialogue for at least the first 15 minutes of the movie, yet the audience is suspended by the charm of a tiny little trash compacter, something that is unheard of in a modern kids movie (let alone a regular movie.) The film also contains an overt environmental message that probably wouldn't have been possible a few years ago. All in all, it's not Pixar's best, but it's still an enjoyable movie and a must see for the big screen because the visual environment is absolutely gorgeous."

The depiction of human life on the ship isn't forced like it so easily could've been. The sort of love story between the robots was also really fun to watch and provided a perfect back story for the front theme of the discovery that the captain was going through.

      "text": "WALL-E is a special kind of movie that is soaked in wit, a spirit of adventure and, rarest of all, sincerity. There is an innocent joy evident within this film of which theaters have not seen in quite some time. WALL-E's powerful first half involves little dialogue and though some may find it boring, the movie never loses sight of where its going and what it wants to be. The second half is more standard Pixar fare but is enhanced by the attachment we grow towards WALL-E early on in the movie. This movie does not try to dazzle us with special effects or perplex us with a complex plot. The animation, though amazing, and the plot, though interesting, never overtake the characters in terms of importance. Pixar' took two significant risks with this movie: taking a slow approach to the scenes on Earth and having a largely speechless main character. Both paid off handsomely making WALL-E an affecting and enthralling classic."

      "text": "It's not unusual for Pixar to make a movie that is unforgetable, flawlessly animated, and mind-blowingly beautiful; but WALL-E took Pixar awesomeness to a whole new level. Some people think that the movie is about \"the dangers of consumerism\", but Director Andrew Stanton himself said that the real main point of the movie is love, and WALL-E is one of the most powerful love stories you will ever see. The movie has really cute lovable characters, stunningly beautiful music by Thomas Newman and Peter Gabriel, subtle humor, and tons of heart, soul, and emotion expressed with very little dialogue. It may seem like a major stretch, but this movie is yet another home run for Pixar. Easily the best movie of 2008, the best movie of decade, and (in my opinion) the best movie of all time. I give this \"LOVEL-E\" masterpiece my highest recommendation. 10/10 (I would give it an 11 if I could)."

It's a heart warming, life-appreciating, gem of a movie. Take a civilization that has never heard about what Earth is and what its people do and I bet you they would be amazed. WALL-E finds a way to show us a society just like that and at the same time give us a new perspective on the little things that we have. If you haven't seen WALL-E yet, go see it now. If you just can't seem to see past the idea of a robot love story, you might want to try and unscrew the blots tightly placed in your head."

To all of you out there without any kids who offer opinions about kids not liking this - SHUT-UP. You don't know what the heck you're talking about."

Only disney does. Anyway, this is easily tied for the best movie of the year in my book. It's message is obvious, but it's told in a moving, never before done way. The 2 main characters have an extraordinarily engrossing romance, and their total dialouge has about 4 different words total. The first half of the film is nearly dialouge-less. It uses its wonderous visuals to share its story. But whent the dialouge does come in, the story doesn't get any less intruiging and the visuals are even more involving. It's a film that has aspects most summer blockbusters have, but this doesn't make it any less fascinating or loveable."
