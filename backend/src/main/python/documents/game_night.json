There is a black couple who really don't do anything apart from stretch one joke  way too long. But the characters of Ryan and Sharon Horgan, Rachel McAdams and Jesse Plemons are very good.

In fact, I can't remember the last time I've laughed so much repeatedly.Lots of clever lines. Good casting all around.

Also, the direction was surprisingly well-thought out for a comedy. A lot of effort clearly went into lighting, camera work, and certain set designs.Bear in mind, I wouldn't suggest this film if you're squeamish. The film mines its humor from the characters contrasting with some dark situations. The scene with Bateman's injured arm in the trailer is more hardcore than is let on.If you watch this, be sure to stay through the beginning of the credits. It's one of the funniest bits of the movie."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Decent, well made comedy.

It has been a while since I've written a review because I feel like the SAT has been eating up my time.

My family does not. But, they still think it was highly enjoyable! I think there's something really appealing about the overused game night gone wrong stereotype (if you're looking for more search Edgar Allen Poe Party on youtube, should be the first thing that comes up, great stuff). The cast was phenomenal and there was not one weak link. Every time I think I can pick a favorite character or favorite scene, I have to change my mind because there are just that many good scenes. Seriously though, I'm trying not to give spoilers but I just want to talk about all the great moments. Billy Magnussen better go places with this and Into the Woods. (Don't pretend Agony was not hilarious) I only single him out because out of the main main comedians, he was the only one without real recognition.  I've been hyped for this since the trailer which I thought was hilarious. The rest of my family thought it looked terrible. I thought it not only lived up to the hype but had a lot more jokes than what you saw in the trailer. I loved it. My parents thought it was funny. The audience was having a great time.

The film is consistently unpredictable and creative, providing inventive ways to create and deliver humour and simultaneously progressing the plot. The overall narrative is competent as well, with decent cinematography and smooth pacing to maintain its compelling story. The characters are although not great or full of depth that can be deeply relatable, they are sufficiently developed with clear differences between personalities and backstories. The solid acting performances also help build the characters. The film is occasionally over the top and some small plot holes might be confusing, but these flaws don\u2019t do much damage to the enjoyment of watching the film. In short, Game Night is not remarkable, but it is a really enjoyable comedy and watching it is a truly fun time.8/10"}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Moments of genuine craftsmanship mixed with insulting storytelling, Game Night shows how far style can carry a complete lack of substance. Tilt shifts shots and a synth soundtrack are used aplenty to give this film a hip and unique feel. There is an ambitious, continuous action shot that is genuinely engaging and subtle uses of CGI that add authentic comedic effects. Performances from Rachel McAdams, Jesse Plemons, Lamorne Morris and Sharon Horgon range from enjoyable to highly memorable. Yet, despite all this praise, the fundamental flaws of Game Night hold the movie back in a major way.While clever details and wit do make their way into the script, the meat of the story is spent meandering through cliche scenes primarily motivated to get cheap laughs. This is to be occasionally expected in a comedy but there comes a point when the story being told becomes practically nothing at all. This issue is only exasperated by the performance of Jason Bateman, who spends much more time coming off as a jerk than anything else. Condescension can be a funny trait to dip into but when it is the only note our protagonist plays, it becomes hard to root for. Deceptively packaged with sleek techniques and a surprise supporting cast, Game Night amounts to a story about almost nothing and an unintentionally dislikable hero.Writing: 2/10Direction: 7/10Cinematography: 7/10Acting: 5/10Editing: 6/10Sound: 7/10Score/Soundtrack: 7/10Production Design: 7/10Casting: 7/10Effects: 7/10Overall Score: 6.2/10Original Article: https://thefilmguys.blog/reviews/augusts-reviews/game-night-2018/"}, {"rating": "2", "text": "A boring cliche comedy movie  which barely had any parts that will make you chuckle."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Was this movie supposed to be funny?

Stuffed full of every reference to every game you've ever played. Also filled with movie reference upon movie reference just to make sure you're having a good time. At one point there was an audible groan coming from the audience and honestly I felt their pain.Max (Jason Bateman) and Annie (Rachel McAdams) are the ultimate competitive couple who host a weekly game night with their equally competitive friends. However, their usual Game Night changes when Max's brother Brooks (Kyle Chandler) comes along and hosts a Game Night with a twist. This isn't your ordinary Game Night, no this is the ultimate Game Night. Someone will be taken and it's up to the teams to use the clues and figure out where the person has been taken, be the first to find them and win the grand prize. Meanwhile some real kidnappers come along at the most convenient time and crash the Game Night. Hilarity ensues as the teammates rush off to solve this mystery while unknowingly participating in a real life hostage situation with real criminals and real weapons...or are they? What's real and what's part of the game is not clear and this only adds to the comedy. At least that was the plan, maybe Game Night was supposed to be hilarious, maybe if their best jokes weren't shoved in all the trailers as a selling point this would have gotten a few laughs out of me.

Game Night is one of your regular American mainstream Jason Bateman comedies (e.g.: Horrible Bosses, Office Christmas Party etc.), but for some reason both critics and the public are raving about it. /I honestly can't remember whan was the last time Jason Bateman gave a legit comedic performance in a film./ The only aspects of the film that stand out are its cinematography, which is inventive at times and Jesse Plemons who was actually pretty funny.

It makes me really question how much is being paid to the \"non-user critics\" to provide reasonable ratings, and I still can't believe the user reviews.

None of that letting the actors ad lib everything and running with the best take approach that seems to be becoming the norm these days. Not that there aren't some fantastic improvised, spur of the moment style comedies out there. It's just that too often they suffer from the unrestrained personalities of their stars, which leads to a lack of focus and consistency in the humor. By giving the actors their dialog and firmly controlling the flow of the jokes, Game Night feels like something of a rarity.The real strength is how well the story is handled. It sounds like just another comedy where average people inadvertently find themselves in extraordinary circumstances that place them squarely out of their depth, and for the most part it is. However the well-crafted twists, turns, and scenarios give it an extra exciting edge. It's also the first mainstream R-rated film that actually knows how to handle guns and danger in ways that don't just feel excessive or unnecessary. I wasn't a huge fan of the subplot about the core protagonist's struggle with having a baby as it really added nothing to the mix and felt clich\u00e9. Luckily, this is the only dramatic sour spot to be found.The third act twist is a bit much and is where the film (knowingly) jumps the shark into straight out action movie fare. The only other complaint I have is surprisingly Rachel McAdams. You can tell this isn't the kind of movie she's used to doing as she has a hard time playing such a comedic role without completely hamming it up every time she's forced to be funny (which is all the time). Everyone else onscreen naturally slips into the style. Her not so much.Game Night's inconsistencies can't keep it from being a laugh riot though. There is a nearly constant stream of incredibly clever gags to be found throughout. Some of the lines are pure gold and totally quotable. You won't find any of the overused chuckle tricks every other comedy with an R rating is using these days like accidental hardcore drug use or anything like that. No, this movie is original, inventive, and oh so fresh.
