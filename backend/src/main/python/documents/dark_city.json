      "text": "Alex Proyas' 'Dark City' is a tough film to review. Mainly because it has a few obvious imperfections, yet it also rises above standard conventions and perceived normality through its director's observational concept.In a way, much like The Strangers in the film, Proyas acts as an omnipotent god, creating clearly defined set-pieces and putting its characters through awkward interactions. These nearly poetic ways in which the characters interact with each other might be seen as unnatural, but to me, its what makes this film a masterpiece. Alex Proyas created a mysterious underworld and we are enclosed in its well-defined borders, much like the rat in the labyrinth in the film, or, more so, like its characters.This film is so beyond normality that we cannot perceive it through our pre-defined societal standards. The entire film takes place in this \"dark city\" and while the characters ask each other where were they taken from there is never no mention of Earth or anything which truly connect us to our reality.This is one of the great powers of this film. It is so elevated and so absorbed in its sci-fi theme and atmosphere that it requires an open mind. But it is also inviting. From a visual point of view, this is not great; it is an exemplary tour-de-force. Mixing neo-noir drama with a perfect amount of sci-fi mystery really creates a stylish, sinister, depressive and dark visual tone with a unique aesthetic.By the time we get closer to the end, everything is revealed to us. But there is no satisfaction. Thinking that this all started in a relatively basic bathroom and then ending on a spaceship without going anywhere is a mind-blowing transition. But what cements this even more as a masterpiece is its approach to human nature and thought. Are we defined by our memories or do we rise above them? It is a relatively common philosophical question, but seeing it unfold in front of our eyes with this theatrical, otherworldly and elegant dialogue and the booming vibrating score really imprints the idea into our minds.By the ending, I realized that I know absolutely nothing about all the characters I lived with for 90 minutes simply because the entire film revolves around a hell which is devout of anything truly real and palpable. Their memories have been changed so many times that they don't know anything about them. Like Dr. Daniel P. Schreber said, we no longer know \"what might have been\" - that line hit hard because at that point I realized that everything is lost.Proyas has said that he appreciates Greek mythology. And this film has many ideas inspired from it. The fact that every time the clocks ticks 12, the characters' memories are changed. But we do not know whether its 12 AM or PM. The sun never shines. This mystery is all-engulfing and mind-boggling. Much like the Titan Prometheus, the torment repeats over and over. The only spark of true humanity seems to be Emma Murdoch (Jennifer Connelly). She is the only one which we feel truly experiences love when he kisses John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell).What I realized is that while we talk and analyze this film, its characters, their behavior, we are missing the point. This is a film not to be analyzed, but experienced. There is really nothing to analyze, after all. The characters, their interactions? How? We don't even know them... hell, we don't even know their true names..."

The lyrics were later translated (with slight differences) to many languages and it became especially popular in Soviet WWII era under the title \"Siniy Platochek\" (\"Blue scarf\"). The song lyrics tell about an unhappy, lonely man who wanders aimlessly around the world thinking about his lost love which is gone forever. His only memento of his beloved one is the blue handkerchief from the title. As the movie is about our memories, the song actually fits the movie mood quite well."

      "text": "It's rare accomplishment for any kind of filmmaker, whether he might be a veteran of this medium or just newcomer starting out, to create a kind of engaging, endlessly-fascinating environment that Proyas brought to the screen in The Crow. Now, with his follow-up movie, ''Dark City'', the director incredibly manages to one-up himself. 1998's ''Dark City'' is quite a remarkable film also quite a cerebral film. You really have to pay attention if you want to follow the plotline perfectly. I feel like i have to see it again to fully enjoy and immerse myself into the full experience that is ''Dark City''\rThe writing is excellent, original, mysterious, surprising, thrilling and dense. The performances are very solid, e.g Rufus Sewell as the paranoid leading man who suffers from memory-loss, Kiefer Sutherland as the peculiar doctor, John Hurt as the hard-headed detective, and Jennifer Connely as the ''wife'' of Sewell's character.\r''Dark City'' has lots of remarkable scenes, but the one that stands out the most is the boat ride scene with Murdoch, Bumstead and Schreber. That scene hits you like a ton of bricks. However, it is quite expositional.\r A tiny detail i noticed (that i loved, and i hope is an intention reference) was in an opening shot that approaches the hotel window behind which we meet Murdoch. The window is a circular dome in a rectangular frame. As clearly as possible, it looks like the \"face\" of Hal 9000 in \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" Hal was a computer that understood everything, except what it was to be human and have emotions. \"Dark City\" considers the same theme in a film that creates a completely artificial world in which humans teach themselves to be themselves.\r The two (slight) problems i had is that the movie is original and has lots of creative ideas, but actually really isnt that original (it's not that Dark City itself was unoriginal, more that the themes expressed in it have been explored in a variety of movies since, and before the movie's been released. Possibly making it a transformative work for the time, but less impactful watching it as a modern viewer.?), it's like an assembly of a whole lot of other films, and Proyas has done that with meticulous precision.\rMovies that come to mind that have a lot of the same elements are (Some will be movies that were released subsequently but still): Brazil, Metropolis, The Matrix, The Truman Show, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, The City of the Lost Children, M, Nosferatu, Inception, Memento, The Game, Total Recall, Blade Runner, The Twilight Zone, Kafka, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, and maybe even a little bit of Batman and The Fifth Element. This doesnt make this movie bad at all, but it was quite obvious and noticed it quite some times throughout watching the film. The other slight problem being, that it can be quite confusing to watch and you really need to have your head in the game, otherwise you will be lost in the story. A second viewing will most likely be very rewarding.\r ''Dark City'' is not a story so much as an experience, it is a triumph of art direction, set design, cinematography, special effects and imagination."

However, do not think this means the film spares any expense to deliver thrilling action and graphics that, despite looking terrible now, were amazing at the time of release and do not throw off the movie even now. Overall, I recommend it to science fiction fans, particularly those who loved the themes and cinematic elements of The Matrix Trilogy, as this movie is very similar in both (though slightly poorer with the graphics since it was released before The Matrix)."

After this horrific awakening questions soon start to arise like why is there no daylight in the city, where he\u2019s awoken? Who are these pale men who seem to control everything? And, most importantly, is J. Murdoch really capable of murder? Even though these questions bring in a theme of mystery at times they also leave the viewer feeling confused and disinterested. But the suspense and action more than make up for this mistake.\rOne of my favourite suspense-filled action scenes is where J. Murdoch is getting chased across rooftops by these strange pale men. The special effects in this scene fill it suspense and horror, which will leave you on the edge of your seat. And the slow-motion camera effects are used in a very good way when J. Murdoch jumps from roof to roof.\rIn this film Rufus Sewell also shows that he is a very good actor by showing us that not only can he play the role of a bad guy like he does in \u201cA Knight\u2019s Tale,\u201d but he can also play the role of a good guy.\rI would recommend this film to anyone who likes action films with a bit mystery and would this film 7/10."

Entirely riveting in that regard, the world created by Alex Proyas is a very interesting one worthy of being evaluated further. The lighting and production design here are great and the acting all-around is stellar. So, then why did I not like it? Well, the writing left much to be desired. The way the story came together and was written took the concept and world created and made it seem boring and worthless. The good acting and direction was wasted on pretty poorly done dialogue. I still appreciate all the positives in this one and wish the end result was better, but sadly, it was not. As a whole, I was expecting a lot more in terms of thrills and drama from this one, but all I saw was a screenplay fumble a great idea and tear down the rest of the movie with it. The positives make this one worth watching though, which is more than you can say for a lot of movies."

      "text": "An imaginative sci-fi thriller with sensational production values/special effects--a vast noir metropolis landscape that seems to exist in an alternate time line, with elements of our present and past combined with visions from a futuristic comic book. Although its story doesn't add up when you analyze it afterward, the movie does take you on a visually arresting ride that offers many entertaining surprises. Director Alex Proyas rewrites movie rules, making its stand on visuals alone. It is hypnotic, haunting, and to be sure, dark. And there's nothing wrong with a movie that is simply sensational to look at.\r\"Dark City\" opens by immersing the audience in the midst of a fractured, nightmarish narrative. The protagonist, who later learns that his name is John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell), has amnesia. He begins his \"awaking\" as a full-grown adult naked in a bath tub, uncertain of how he got there. His only company in his hotel room is the nude body of a dead prostitute. Much like that plot, the main character here, and the audience as well, is thrown into the story without any idea of what's really happening. It's an effective tool as it puts the audience on a level playing field with the main character with similar motives.\rSuddenly, Murdoch receives a phone call from a man named Dr. Schreber (Kiefer Sutherland), who claims to have his best interests at heart. Schreber warns him to get out of the hotel immediately. Soon, without a clue about his identity, Murdoch is fleeing from phantom-like creatures with supreme mental powers. When cornered, Murdoch discovers he is not defenseless against his enemies -- his mind, like theirs, can shape reality, although he doesn't understand how to harness his abilities. Soon, his quest to unearth his past links him up with Emma (Jennifer Connelly), a woman who is supposedly his wife, and Police Inspector Bumstead (William Hurt), who believes Murdoch to be innocent of the prostitute's murder. But Murdoch's small group of allies offer little help when it comes to dealing with his powerful, ghoulish adversaries, the amoral Mr. Book (Ian Richardson) and Mr. Hand (Richard O'Brien).\rWhile the story does slightly deal with the main character's memories coming back to him, that's what is really missing. Movies like this usually have those feint images of the past holding the key to unlocking the mystery, but this film's more concerned with the thought of memories being erased and/or passed around, then with what's actually inside those thoughts. The film's storyline is a bit weak but manages to remain intriguing by informing and evolving \"on-the-go\", though the ending is a bit of a disappointment. Alex Proyas once again delivers a phenomenal spectacle by creating a somber, despairing ambiance set in \"Dark City\". \"Dark City'' is a cinematic experience-- it is a triumph of art direction, set design, cinematography, and special effects."

      "text": "Alex Proyas's noisy psychedelic movie nightmare, \"Dark City,\" is so relentlessly trippy in a fun-house sort of way that it could very easily inspire a daredevil cult of moviegoers who go back again and again to experience its mind-bending twists and turns. Although its story doesn't add up when you analyze it afterward, the movie does take you on a visually arresting ride that offers many unsettling surprises right up to a sentimental sunburst of an ending that has a paranoid undertone.\r The elements of that ride suggest that Proyas, who masterminded the popular teen-age mind-blower \"The Crow,\" is a walking encyclopedia of weird science-fiction and horror imagery. At its best, the movie feels like a magician's trick, a gleefully improvised demonic fantasy of ominous evil genies conjured out of bottles and stirred into a steamy swirl that brings in everything from Franz Kafka to Vincent Price, from Fritz Lang to \"Star Trek.\"\r The movie's premise -- that what we call reality might simply be a fantasy imposed by an omniscient mad scientist -- is unsettling enough to make you wonder if it could actually derail a seriously drug-addled mind. The world it envisions is a stylized, claustrophobic, fantasy of Depression-era New York City existing in perpetual night. Here the residents have unknowingly become the scientific playthings of a race of gray-faced fascistic aliens, the Strangers, whose voyeuristic obsession with human feeling recalls the sexual obsession experienced by those hyper-mental veiny-browed coneheads who fed off human fantasies in the pilot episode of \"Star Trek.\"\r Threatened with extinction, these invaders have determined to colonize the Earth. Their leader is a sinister proto-fascist wraith with priestly airs named Book, who is played with a wonderfully icy relish by Ian Richardson. This British actor, who brought such blood-chilling hauteur to the role of Francis Urquhart, a Machiavellian British prime minister, in the satirical BBC series \"House of Cards,\" outdoes himself here in sang-froid, effusing the imperial grimness of a bloodthirsty lord high executioner.\r The invaders operate from secret catacombs in the heart of the city. Among their powers is an ability to put all the residents to sleep at the same time. While unconscious, they become subjects in an elaborate experiment involving injections through the forehead that mix and match people's memories. It is all a search for (get this!) the human soul. The Strangers also have the telekinetic ability to move objects, and during these blackouts in which time appears to stop, they rearrange the city's architecture. In the movie's most visually striking sequences, buildings shift, and the entire metropolis heaves into a different configuration.\r When the residents awake with new memories and fresh personalities, many won't even remember their names. But every once in a while, a mistake is made, and a subject wakes up in the middle of an experiment. The movie's hero, John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell), is one such premature riser. No sooner has he regained consciousness than he finds himself being investigated for a murder he does not recall committing. He doesn't realize it at first, but he now possesses the Strangers' telekinetic powers.\r The plot that \"Dark City\" builds on John's predicament is a confused affair involving childhood memories of an idyllic seaside upbringing in a place called Shell Beach that may or may not exist. John also has a wife named Emma (Jennifer Connelly) who may or may not be an idea planted in his head. It hardly matters, because the love story has no weight.\r Kiefer Sutherland, in a hyperkinetic turn as a duplicitous doctor employed by the Strangers, suggests a punked-out Vincent Price. And William Hurt walks through the role of a police inspector looking into the murder. How this character succeeded in not having his mind played with by the Strangers is one of the many gaping holes in a movie that's much more interested in blowing your mind than in adhering to any interior logic."

Definitely not for this current generation, although I'd love to see a throwback every now and then, that warps me back to the late 80s Tim Burton era. And as far as breathing that essense is concerned, Alex Proyas, the co-writer and director, has got that particular style written all over these gorgeous rich images shared in this film. But just like any style would, it only has legs to run so far. Just the first act, in this case. For after the tone sets in and the demand kicks in, the substance grows necessary and the luxury (style, as mentioned) feels like famished into that bank, which the makers feel free to use as an excuse of narrative.What actually the film feeds on other than glamour is how it romanticizes a secret, a rumor. Everything is hyped up to the perfect amount, teasing us, preparing us for a dazzling show that ends up only in the been-here-seen-that acts. Also it's not just the predictability but also its inadequacy to satisfy us with that very expected product. And I don't just mean the film in its entirety.But also, what is part of it. Characters, disappoints. Relationship disappoints. World, disappoints. Arcs, is what we are left with, generically mystic; which by the way could also be interpreted as commercially or irrelevantly. And among these disappointments, the star cast holds on to their reputation, from Jennifer Connelly as a fishy seductress to Kiefer Sutherland as the know-it-all messenger to William Hurt as the uncompromised hunky detective to Rufus Sewell as our empathetic protagonist sharing our views, viewer's views, for the most part of the film. Dark City is dark, undoubtedly, but it is not bright enough to prove why is it so dark, it's just dark- I cannot say dark enough."
