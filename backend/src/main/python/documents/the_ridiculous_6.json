      "text": "The Ridiculous 6 is purely another example of Adam Sandler's crap. Its official he has invaded our theatres and our homes. Netflix certainly doesn't value quality after offering him a movie deal. The cast is full of typical Sandler collaborators and some talented names like Nick Nolte and Luke Wilson. Sandler co-wrote this movie and if he gave a damn he maybe could've created a notable comedy franchise with this movie because the story has a good amount of potential but the delivery is terrible. The characters are extremely undeveloped and unfunny. Then you have the completely terrible character played by Jorge Garcia who does not speak a comprehendible word in the whole movie. Then the movie is too long and is filled with plenty of obvious Sandler stunt doubles in the action scenes. Then the tone is some unpredictable and sometimes it even difficult to see who the main character is because there it seems like different actors get too much attention at times. As far as I'm concerned Netflix just pissed away 60 Million."

The movie has a fairly simple premise as White Knife (Adam Sandler) goes on an adventure with his 5 brothers played by some absolutely hilarious actors. This 119 minute masterpiece had be giggling like a small baby that i kidnapped and put in my basement. With this beautiful movie, which transcends all emotions and even life itself, Sandler has forever put himself on a high and might chariot soaring above bad film makers like Kubrick, Fincher and Scorsese. This movie has a single flaw, and that flaw is the lack of Kevin James as Paul Blarts great great great great great grandpa Graul Blart. With Graul Blart the Paul Blart canon would be tied with The Ridiculous 6 forever making the most perfect series of movies ever knows to man"

But the other hand I am glad I'm on the couch. Adam Sandler is Tommy, he was raised by Indians he is approached by his long lost father Frank Stockburn (Nick Nolte) who tells him that he needs 50, 000 or he'll get killed by his own gang. Tommy goes on a journey to find his 5 brothers (Rob Schneider, Taylor Lautner, Jorge Garcia, Terry Crews and Luke Wilson). This film is just painful, these talented people (expect Sandler) are just stuck in a lazy Adam Sandler film. But I found some moments. 2.5 out 5 stars"

      "text": "Adam Sandler\u2019s straight-to-Netflix film, The Ridiculous 6, represents an even larger fall from grace for the once successful comedian. After seeing the trainwrecks that were Grown Ups 2, and That\u2019s My Boy I figured Sandler couldn\u2019t stoop any lower, I was wrong. The Ridiculous 6 is unfunny, terribly acted, overly silly, dumb, and truly terrible in almost all facets. It seems sad because Sandler is talented, but if he continues making films like this, he can\u2019t maintain an audience.\rAdam Sandler has become increasingly lazy over the last few years, but this film goes beyond that. Ridiculous 6 features an odd type of humor, which is a combination of dumb, silly, and racist. The humor is so stupid, it rarely registers as funny, but often feels like awkward moments of randomness. The film features a ton of cameos, most of them are distracting and not funny, except Vanilla Ice as Mark Twain.    The humor was not only dumb, but it was exceedingly silly too.\rThe film\u2019s acting is terrible, on every level. Sandler feels like he\u2019s mailing in his performance, while Taylor Lautner takes a giant step backwards as an actor. While Rob Schneider, Luke Wilson, and Terry Crewes manage to not come across as distractingly bad, almost every performance is awful. What doesn\u2019t help the acting is that the film has almost no story, terrible dialogue, and characters that are just racist stereotypes. It\u2019s sad looking at it, because many talented actors appear in the film, but they are all totally wasted.\rThe story of Ridiculous 6 is more a bunch of random situations sloppily put together, built entirely on logical fallacies. Since the story is terribly constructed it feels bloated, and the film drags on. In retrospect the film is really about a half-hour too long. On top of that the film\u2019s villains are weak, and thus the film\u2019s conflict feels fake, and forced. Really when looking at closely it all comes down to the fact, that the film was lazily constructed.\rIn conclusion The Ridiculous 6 represents a new low for Adam Sandler, who continues to get lazier, and lazier. The film is dumb, silly, racist, boring, not funny, and features a story that is so poorly written a 4 year old could have produced a better story. Hopefully, Sandler feels a negative backlash and finally takes some pride in his work, because he clearly has none now."

      "text": "Well the title certainly does the film justice. Yes Adam Sandler has made much worse films in the past, but this is also easily up there with some of his most idiotic attempts. First off, don't even get me started on his pathetic attempt to sound \"cool\" with that deep and raspy voice of his the whole film. As for the rest of the film in general, with the exception of a slight chuckle or two, I found myself cringing and shaking my head in disbelief at almost every pathetic attempt at a joke or one-liner. I should've known better with it being a Sandler film that every other joke would be a fart or poop joke. And much like the characters, the whole film also felt jumbled and confused as to what direction it wanted to go in or what its intention was, especially towards the end, which by then made the film feel even more pointless. Overall, if you don't mind killing two hours of your life (along with some precious brain cells), then don't hesitate. Otherwise, I'd steer clear of this one. Surely Netflix can do better. They've usually offered much better original content than this."

From there it's downhill all the way. Despite fine cinematography from Dean Semler (Dances With Wolves, Road Warrior), everything in this film is ugly. The casual racism/sexism is alongside childish poop jokes that only a child would find funny. Thing is, this isn't a movie for children. The usual ex-SNL suspects show up..Schneider, Spade, Lovitz, cameos from McDonald and Kattan. And his movie road company buddies Buscemi, Torturro, and Keitel. Add to that Nick Nolte, Will Forte, Steve Zahn, among many others (Vanilla Ice as Mark Twain? Blake Shelton as Wyatt Earp? Why not.) But the major problem is Sandler himself. If he was accused of playing the same type film after film, he now underplays to the point of practically sleepwalking, muttering his monotone dialogue (also see Pixels, or don't). This makes A Million Ways To Die In The West look like Citizen Kane. Interesting casting fact. You may remember when some American Indians walked off the set because of some offending tribal names. So who was cast as Never-Wears-Bra? Jackie Sandler. Sandler's wife. Hey, a role's a role, right? Gotta support the hubby... As long as Sandler surrounds himself with the same \"talent\" as in writer Tim Herlihy and director Frack Coraci, he'll keep making the same crap. Seriously, Sandler-ites. What was his last good, funny movie? Pixels...Blended...Grown Ups 1 & 2...That's My Boy...Jack and Jill...shall I go on?"

There is literally nothing redeemable about this movie, yeah you may chuckle here and there but there is literally nothing redeemable about Adam Sandler's latest attempt to make a even mildly entertaining movie. Thats the frustrating thing, I believe Adam Sandler can act and can make a good movie. Hes proven it in in the past with good movies like Reign Over Me, Spanglish, Punchdrunk Love, Funny People, or even Click but he continues to waste away his career with these pointless and downright lazy films that he actually thinks people will find funny. His performance in this movie even seems phoned in,  Taylor Lautner is bad and while the rest of the cast manage to do a decent job at being not as bad. It almost doesn't help their case that the film has almost no story of substance, the dialogue is laughable, and the characters are lower than anything youd come to expect in an adam sandler flick.

That's about the only good thing I can really say about the movie.\r The movie was supposed to be a parody of westerns, but it was not funny. Racism was a big part of the script, but I know that for whatever reason a lot of people are going to just dismiss that as \"SJW\" nonsense, and the racism has been pointed out enough times that it doesn't need another mention by me. I think everyone knows that part.\r Even if you're willing to dismiss that on the grounds of it being \"liberal\" or \"SJW\" crap, you can't deny the movie was insanely boring. This movie did not deserve to be 2 hours long. It was not that good, nor was it good at all. Gross out comedy and being intentionally offensive are just lazy humor. That's all this movie was: Pure laziness.\r I know some people want to claim that this movie pokes fun at racism. Maybe it did try that, but if it did it failed and became racist itself. If you want to watch a good film that parodies the western genre while actually making fun of racism then watch \"Blazing Saddles.\""

      "text": "I feel compelled to write a review about Ridiculous 6 just to counter all the negative ones that people are writing lately.  Adam Sandler has been getting routinely lambasted by people who just don't seem to understand that he's not going to change. His form of comedy is still aligned to his fans.  In short, Adam Sandler will be Adam Sandler.\r In a social climate where writers are too cautioned to tell any kind of stereotypical joke, Sandler comes in swinging with South Park tenacity.  He may not be as witty as the Stone and Parker combination, but it hardly comes across as racist.  It's too easy to call things racist today, and that word is being flung around too much lately that it's lost all meaning.  The characters are diverse, and everyone gets it, including white people. You won't find many critics ever bringing that part up, either.  The narrative is that this movie is \"racist\" towards Native Americans.\r Now, this is far from the best Adam Sandler movie he's made, but it's also far, far from the worst he or his studio has made (Strange Wilderness receives that accolade from me).  It's framed as a Western parody, but it flows like your average Sandler film. A huge cast peppered with Sandler regulars such as David Spade and Rob Schneider deliver silly jokes and slapstick bits. The humor tends to go a little past my threshold for crude humor at times (a donkey with explosive diarrhea for example) but also has some outrageously hilarious moments like a botched hanging of Taylor Lautner.\r Speaking of Lautner, he honestly has stolen the spotlight of this film.  He plays a slow-minded but innocent-spirited half brother (of which all six of the Ridiculous 6 are of relation) to Sandler and this is just a career defining moment for him. It's a goofball role that ranks right up there with other actors who've cut loose like Duane Johnson, Justin Timberlake and Brad Pitt.  Honestly, the aforementioned botched hanging was one of the funniest scenes for me.\r To be honest, though, there are two points constantly brought up in the negative reviews that I agree with. First point is that Sandler's acting is simply limp.  The character he is trying to for perform just isn't very enthusiastic,  It's not that it's designed to be that way; you can just tell he isn't putting any energy into it.  It's not that bothersome to me, though, because the movie is put on the shoulders of its supporting cast., which again, is quite large.  The second point is that it's about 30 minutes too long.  There are many skits, including a scene with John Turturro and the origin of baseball, that don't really serve the story's progression.  As a result, some scenes lose a bit of comedic impact because they feel like filler.\r If you don't like Adam Sandler, you're obviously not going to enjoy this movie.  Good, because it's not made for you.  Instead, this is a pure Sandler film through and through and if you've been a long time Sandler fan, there's little chance you're going to be disappointed by it.  If you're one of those Sandler fans that loved his older work and wished he could return to that era, your only option is to give it a try.  Good news if you're already a Netflix subscriber: it won't cost you a cent more to watch it.  Give it a shot."

The 'in your face' jokes, the friends joke, the inside jokes (between actors), genre jokes...list goes on.  there is so much to this movie that all people care about is if it makes a few people... hate this phrase, 'BUTT HURT\" over nonsense.  If you think it's being insulting to the native Indians... what about the being insulting to WHITE PEOPLE for having us use that language towards them?  Oh wait... that's how they use to talk back in the day.  Political Correct people need to shut the hell up and just ENJOY what's out there instead of hating everything because it's 'popular' to do.\r Great film.  Lots of laughs.  I support Sandler since his days of SNL, Billy Madison, Longest Yard, Little Nicky, Growns Ups... he has made me laugh for years and still continues to do his job with The Ridiculous 6!"

      "text": "Watched this with my partner, and was thoroughly entertained. I've seen a few reviews about it being a movie  revolving around 6 half brothers, and some WTF moments, and the reviews are not positive. There is little suspense, a shallow plot line and some very questionable acting in places. This is most certainly not Nolan's Dark Knight, nor is it Inception, or Shutter Island.\r I am not a fan of Twlight, and to see \"Jacob\" on the screen was not something I looked forward to. In actual fact, I should not have judged so quickly! The Ridiculous 6 played their individual roles well, fulfilling every comedy stereotype to facilitate my roaring laughter!\r This, in true Happy Madison this is a feature length film of satire, humor and the story of 6 main characters in a ridiculous situation. We thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and would happily watch it again! Well played Netflix, well played Sandler.\r For those who disapprove of the plotline following a group of 6 people in a ridiculous situation, perhaps next time Happy Madison and Netflix could warn you, by titling the movie appropriately. Like calling it the Extraordinary Half Dozen, or the Outrageous Sextuplets, or perhaps the Ridiculous 6?\r Oh...wait...hang on a second...\r 10/10 from me!"

This flick is a tad better than that redonkulous Zohan movie. That's for sure."

      "text": "I don't really get the hate for this one. It's nowhere near the level of \"Jack and Jill\" or that \"That's My Boy\" and closer in quality to \"You Don't Mess With the Zohan\", if not quite \"Happy Gilmore\" level. I thought this was well-shot, decently acted, harmless fun for the most part, and unlike most recent Adam Sandler films, this one actually had something resembling a story, plus his performance as a knife-wielding purveyor of mystical **** is actually kind of badass. The script isn't written by Shakespeare, but it's serviceable and let's be real, we're talking about Sandler here. I was actually pleasantly surprised by the cohesiveness of the story. As one might expect from a Happy Madison production, not all of the jokes hit their targets, but that doesn't mean there aren't some memorable sequences. It was great seeing Harvey Keitel onscreen again. Terry Crews pulls off every reaction shot perfectly, proving his comedy chops, and Taylor Lautner goes all out in portraying the dumb brother with a heart of gold. Rob Schneider has some fun moments, too, though Luke Wilson and Jorge Garcia are somewhat under-utilized. John Turturro's sequence as Abner Doubleday is a standout that points out how the rules of baseball seem totally arbitrary. But it's Vanilla Ice as Mark Twain that steals the show IMO. I would normally give this film a 7 but I'm giving it an 8 to counter-balance all the negative reviews. Seriously, did the people who hated this really find nothing enjoyable at all? The gorgeous cinematography and decent soundtrack? The respectful treatment of the Apache? I'm not a fan of most of Sandler's filmography, but this was not a bad or unwatchable movie by any metrics. In fact I'd say it's something of a return to form for him."

      "text": "It's no \"Blazing Saddles\" but The Ridiculous Six is a pretty entertaining parody of westerns, and a notable step-up from some of Sandler's recent efforts. The cast were great, and the set pieces were pretty impressive. I laughed on more than a few occasions (the baseball scene and the bank-robbing montage in particular) and I really don't see why everybody thinks it's so racist. Sure, there were a few scenes that might seem kind of offensive, but overall, there wasn't anything as racist as Rob Schneider pretending to be a Native American in \"Bedtime Stories\". Some of the jokes were a bit gross, but there were still more laughs than the average Sandler flick. So overall, The Ridiculous 6 isn't for everyone, but it's still a fun movie, and one of the better recent Happy Madison films. Just lighten up and enjoy."
