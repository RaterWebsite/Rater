Such a glorious moment of triumph, I wanted to stand up and scream \"Yes!\". This movie truly depicted that prison life in the fifties was just as hard for new prisoners as it is implied today.

I highly recommend it."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Warning: SpoilersShawshank Redemption is without doubt one of the best films ever made, and definitely the best film of 1994. Yes, it is better than Lion King, and I really like that too. It is not only enthralling but powerful and moving too. I will confess that I didn't understand it when I first saw it as a lot happens in the film, and I have now seen it three times. I seriously hope, that those who ignored the film when it was first released now recognise it as a great film, as it really is. The dialogue was extremely well-written, with lines that really stick in your mind. The cinematography and music are both gorgeous, and the prison itself is like a character that dominates the film. In the script, there are some true elements of Stephen King Now I admit I am not a huge king fan, and usually don't like coarse language in books. But in his books like It, which is very good, I have accepted the language represents brutality and rebellion, shown perfectly in the film with the battle of acceptance I suppose between the inmates and the superiors(like the scene with the warden yelling coarse language at the new inmates lined up in a row at the beginning.)The acting was exceptional. I am not hugely familiar with Tim Robbins, but he did a great job in a very demanding role. The best performance however, comes from Morgan Freeman as Red, who was seriously robbed of that Oscar, that he lost to Tom Hanks for Forrest Gump. Freeman reminds me very strongly, or his style of acting does, remind me of that of Sean Connery, suave yet very charismatic. Acting isn't just about your vocal range, it's about depth, which was what Freeman certainly had. In short, Freeman was brilliant in what could be his best performance. The scene where the inmates are listening to the Mozart aria over the speakers was a beautiful profound moment, and I actually cried in Brook's death scene. Very rarely do King adaptations translate-to screen well, because of the large scale of the author's books, with the exception of this and the Shining. Some like It and Dreamcatcher are genuinely memorable but have a number of flaws that prevent them from being classed as outstanding. And some, like Thinner and Tommyknockers that border on unwatchable. In conclusion Shawshank is a brilliant film, that is worthy of the credit it has been denied for so-long. 10/10 of course. Bethany Cox."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Despite a marvelous start paved with amazingly captured exposure scenes, attractive flashbacks and an unavoidable narration from Morgan Freeman, 'The Shawshank Redemption' sadly manages to lose its main plot into deceptively intertwined sub-plots.Originally presented as a classic film, it ends up being more like a documentary on the American prison system. Surely we closely follow the experience of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), whose performance remains striking by the way, but the scenario tends to incorporate dull and shallow characters. Obviously you are never incarcerated alone, and the omnipresence of others is a point of life in jail you can't miss, but here the movie doesn't even bother to link characters further than the few relations we see them have on screen. It is like if all characters evolved on their own but still achieve to develop a great team spirit.In the end there remains numerous unanswered questions and misunderstandings. All I can say is that director Frank Darabont wanted to be sure we see that Andy Dufresne suffer a lot and withstand many terrible events. That we see him trying to remain upright and honest, tough in his own way. But for what ? His revenge tastes so bland and uncompelling compared to what we see him go through almsot two complete hours ! The ending seems so disappointing and awkwardly dreamy compared to the rationality and coldness of the beginning of the movie, as if the screenwriters had bent over the script and written it all at once, without bothering to add the glue that would have allowed the many pieces of the puzzle to fit together."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "To be able to watch this after 20+ years after its release and still feel such emotion is something that few films can accomplish, from characters you will quickly find yourself attached with, to an amazing look at the prison system, and a storyline that will have anyone unable to look away.This movie really does deserve its Metacritic score and if you have the time do give it a watch."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "The greatest movie in the world may have been depressing in some parts, but it has such a good story.
