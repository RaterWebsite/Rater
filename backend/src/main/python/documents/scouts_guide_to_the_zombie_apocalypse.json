It's what people used to call a \"madcap comedy.\"  It succeeds in making most of Romero's stuff look worse than lame and it's far funnier than Shaun of the Dead.  Also, the people who made this film appear to know something about pacing.\r Anyone who rates this film at 6 or less is probably a very boring person."

It's a dopey gargantuan dumb fun with charming, witty and like able characters also grand CGI, Landon's film is mirthful and has a heart not to mention funny juvenile humor, but his directing isn't well handled also not good when comes to comedy, but at least he lets his actors shine. Ben (Tye Sheridan from Tree of Life) is a local scout troop along with sex-obsessed Carter and nerdy Augie (Joey Morgan). Ben doesn't like the uniform because it doesn't attract the ladies, a random zombie apocalypse hits their small town. They team up with the tough kick-ass cocktail waitress Denise (Sarah Dumont) who works at the strip club called Lawrence of Alabia. I forgive the screenwriters including Christopher Landon (who co-wrote the script and direct Paranormal Activity: Marked Ones also co-wrote the three Paranormal Activity installments) for adding teen-romance and drama. Ty Sheridan, Logan Miller and Joey Morgan have some A1 chemistry and they can act, but this isn't there best film, but the film shows what their talents. Grade B"

My husband and I rented this one thinking \"Meh, the reviews weren't so great but let's give it a shot.\" So I guess I don't understand -- were we all watching the same flick?? I feel like reviewers calling it \"sophomoric\" and \"ribald\" and \"frenzied\" are utterly missing the point: that's exactly what it's going for, because it's turning every single decency-duty-and-honor scout cliche right on its head. I've been a horror fan for years, and thought I'd seen everything the (WAY) overplayed \"zombie apocalypse\" genre had to offer. This movie is absolutely fearless in its attempts to cook up the most screwball, gross-out, left-of-center scenarios imaginable -- and it has an absolute, unabashed ball serving them up. I dunno, I thought practically everything about this film was a riot ... and buried under all that mayhem is a sweet heart to boot. As a general reference point, I loved \"Shaun of the Dead\" and \"Zombieland.\" This one delivered just as many action-packed scares and gross-outs, but made me laugh more."

In the opening scene itself convinced me that it's going to be aggressive as the progression commence. Yeah, it lived up to my last minute expectation. A fine time pass movie for the regular audience, definitely it won't suits for the critics' viewing.\r When the three friends find virus outbreak in their town that turns everyone into zombies, they plan to make into a safe place along saving a few others in their attempt. Surely this is what every zombie movie you have seen dealt with. The same old adventure in zombie theme, but the characters and the scenarios were different with lots of fun. I was surprised at that part, surely a cult status will be tagged for it.\r Overall movie was decent, but being a horror-comedy was its strength. Just leave the logics behind and enjoy the entertainment it offers. In the end you will be convinced for your patience. It is the movie you might like it, but can't give full marks. One of the many reasons was, it is not a mainstream actor or the filmmaker's film. But still the entire team was awesome, and delivered its purpose. It was not a box office hit, but still I expect there will be a sequel.\r 7/10"

You know what I mean; the hundreds of zombie movies that appear to have been filmed by bored high school kids during summer vacation.  The experience was thankfully more akin to Zombieland.\r Combining witty (frequently over-the-top) humor, clever sight gags, inventive zombie death and dismemberment scenes and the best use of a trampoline ever, Scout's Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse is not only similar in tone to the 2009 horror comedy hit (Zombieland) but is easily the best and most fun zombie romp since Woody Harrelson's epic quest for Twinkies.  Do yourself a favor and give it a shot, but don\u2019t spoil anything with the trailer.  I haven't seen the trailer, but I hear it gives away least two memorable scenes.\r Final Verdict: Highly recommended!"

It's cheesy, stupid, at at times very funny. In the end though it's not hard to wish that there was just more good about it overall.\r The young cast is pretty talented. Although Tye Sheridan seems a little wooden here and you can tell he really isn't trying at all. The majority of the laughs come from Logan Miller who occasionally is forced to overact because of the material. The rest of the cast just sort of lays on the cheese with their performances, but who can really blame them this kind of movie.\r As far as the action goes the movie has some pretty great gore effects. The kills are brutal and often absurd. It makes the whole thing more entertaining overall and proves once again that it's just fun to watch people kill zombies.\r If only the jokes were just as entertaining. Unfortunately not all of them stick the landing. There are some laugh out loud funny moments here, but all too often the movie just relies on the characters freaking out at the sight of boobs or making lame penis jokes to get by. Yet for all it's stupidity and half-hearted attempts at sexual humor there are some hilariously absurd moments that will have you rolling on the floor.\r Is it worth putting up with the rest of the film to see them though? It depends. If you just really enjoy zombies and immature R-rated humor like I do then it's worth a quick rental for some cheap thrills. How ever if you have a.... classier, more refined sense of humor then stay far away. The penis jokes, boobs, and blood aren't going to be your cup of tea.\r Yet, even for those of us who love this kind of thing this isn't the most entertaining way to get our fix. Yet, like I said it's worth a cheap watch just for some gross laughs and zombie killing fun. The plot and lesson about friendship and growing up might fall flat on it's face, but when it comes to watching a mostly charming cast come together as high school losers facing zombies it has it's moments. That at least makes it passable in my book."

Of course they split from Augie, the schlub, to attend. Of course they're discovered by Augie. Of course they make up and become better friends at the end. And the good guy gets the girl in the end. After saving the day, of course-....I gave it an extra point because it's gleefully dirty in a totally juvenile way, with zombie dick jokes and a zombie oral sex scene that was beaten by ReAnimator thirty years ago, but was still appreciated.

Well im glad to say that times might be changing as this film is as good if not better than the yardstick of shaun of the dead, from the hysterical opening scene scouts guide to the zombie apocalypse is a instant hit. When three scouts on the last camping trip find themselves in a life or death situation when there town is taken over by blood thirsty zombies they have to use all there knowledge they picked up in scouts to try save themselves and there town. There are some awesome kill scenes the comedy is genius from the dolly parton to Britney spears scene this film is a must see!! the plot is a bit thin but with the brilliant acting and script it makes up for it, scouts guide to the zombie apocalypse is now the new yardstick for true comedy/horror films."

There is a scene where there is a zombie dancing to his favorite song and there is one zombie in strip club crouch running idk if that's a word and I thought they were going somewhere with these but no they just didn't know what to do with the film. It's bad u didn't even laugh once during the entire movie. I do not recommend"
