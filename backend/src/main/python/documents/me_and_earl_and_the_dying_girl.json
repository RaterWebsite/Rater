But alas, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is a true testament to the power of YA pop culture, and a young adult film infused with the current obsession with cancer-driven teen fiction.\r Following in the footsteps of the widely popular The Fault in Our Stars and my personal favourite cancer-comedy 50/50, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is a mix of both, with a hint of 500 Days of Summer in for good indie measure.\r Thankfully, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is miles ahead of the aforementioned Stars and is easily one of the most wryly self-aware and raucously comedic films of the year.\r The ironic aspect of Me and Earl is that cancer has never really been at the front-row of comedy in the real world. Although it is one of the most devastating diseases of our time, consuming the lives of many loved ones, cancer, in this instance, sets up one of the most endearing and authentic cinematic friendships seen on screen, in a very long time.\r Now if you are all thinking, how in the hell is a film about a very pending friendship between two boys and a girl recently diagnosed with leukaemia one of the funniest and best films of the year? All I\u2019d have to say is \u201cRespect the Research\u201d and find out for yourself.\r THIS IS THE PART WHERE I EXPLAIN MY COMMENTARIES ON THE FILM\r One of the many (and I\u2019m talking about a ton) charms of Me and Earl is its ability to share so many universal and relatable truths to its audience. The fact remains, Rachel Kushner (Olivia Cooke) is a seventeen-year old girl who is recently diagnosed with Leukaemia. Greg Gaines (Thomas Mann) is a smart-talking, quick responding, social leper who has serious issues with the word friendship and a great appreciation for hipster and event-garde culture (including Warhol, Herzog and B-films). Earl (RJ Cyler), the innocent by-stander in all of this, is your typical high-schooler who obsesses mostly with ****  Yet, these three unique characters and the serious and lighthearted issues they face in a small Pittsburg high school offer some of the most insightful and emotional responses from an audience in the year 2015.\r Based on Jesse Andrews\u2019 book of the same name, the author was able to adapt his own book into a screenplay, keeping its infectious charm and wit intact. Luckily for us, Andrews\u2019 book has been described as a book made to be read by anyone; anyone who has gone to high school, anyone who has lost someone they love, or grew up with a family, or has wondered what life is all about.\r Directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, a sophomore feature following his debut horror film The Town That Dreaded Sundown, the film blends a very inauspicious mix of quirk at first by beginning the story with an abundance of stop-motion animation, flashbacks, and some very obvious film-school favourites including; the long take; pans; and long shots. Rejon, who began his career as a personal assistant to Martin Scorsese, shows his range as a charming director who is able to not only amp up the quirk factor, but also get the best performances from his actors and characters to help narrate the story to uncontrollable moments of laughter. Much like its main character Greg (Thomas Mann) and his inability to obtain normal friendships or accept the obvious classes created in any high school setting, Rejon embraces the main essence of Andrews\u2019 novel, loss and love and stays true to its unique nerdiness, owning every second of it.\r THIS IS THE PART WHERE I\u2026TALK\r It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, and for the most part, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is easily one of the most satisfying films of 2015, and not for the usual ingredients that make an indie film so great either. While most indie films are applauded and hailed for their quirky soundtracks, incredible acting discoveries, and new finds, Me and Earl has an interesting quality of brining back the old, and making it cool again. Rejon, an obvious film enthusiast and lover of classics (Criterion quality to B-movie selections) sends great satisfaction of allowing his feature of reminiscing on these classic films in a fringe-type cinematic wet dream. His rehashing, mockery yet clear praise and reference to classic films shows his great admiration and love for film as a whole. While Greg and Earl half-heartedly remake some of their favourtite films, we get a clear sense of what makes them great friends, their ability to embrace their immaturity and playfulness. Rejon pulls it off through and through, that boys will be boys, while Mann and Cyler really hit that notion out of the par throughout each scene."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "I'll admit I'm a sucker for these coming of age films and this one is no exception.

We've seen some similar movies to this but this movie can find the balance and the right placement between the humor and the sad part of the story. This movie is equally well acted by the entire cast especially Thomas Mann who can play an awkward character realistically without me feeling awkward watching it.\rThis movie is also beautifully written by the author of the book which I think it's very important as he can tell very deeply about the main important character he created, Greg. I think it's interesting how He wrote Greg and Rachel as the realest characters in this movie and make others as these comical and not so serious supporting characters. I think it's important because this whole movie is supposed to tell how this dying girl can somehow change Greg's view in life.

(Hey, I am looking forward to \u201cMagic Mike XXL\u201d next week, what can I tell you?)\r In the case of \u201cEarl\u201d and \u201cDope\u201d I think there is definitely a very wide generation gap. The last time I saw my teens was 60 years ago and though I enjoyed \u201cThe Fault Is In Our Stars\u201d last year it was more of a drama than teenage angst. There is some humor in \u201cEarl\u201d regarding the movies that Earl (RJ Cyler) and Geg (the \u2018Me\u2019-- Thomas Mann) make redoing classics, especially the titles they give their films. Olivia Cooke is certainly endearing as \u2018the dying girl, Rachel, while Greg grows up over the course of the film and Earl is a wise young man before his time.\r Molly Shannon as Rachel\u2019s single mother and Connie Britton as Greg\u2019s mother, both overbearing parents, along with Nick Offerman as his beatnik father---by the way Earl doesn\u2019t have any parents and lives with his older brother who threatens Greg with telling him his dog will bite off his face--and Jon Bernthal as a teacher and, more or less, a guidance counselor to the boys, are sort of annoying adults you will find in most pictures about teenagers though the latter less than the others.\r \u201cEarl\u201d is being sold as a comedy, a sort of John Hughes movie with lessons to be learned. Greg is constantly reminding the audience--there is a lot of voice over-- that Rachel doesn\u2019t die and there are screen titles telling the passing of time and where we are at in the story. As a social misfit Thomas Mann carries the film and RJ Cyer is his effective sidekick and shows his many sides. Olivia Cooke is endearing as the dying girl who has leukemia and is very instrumental is helping Greg grow up.\r The direction by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon is all over the place, somewhat like the movies the boys make, while the screenplay by Jesse Andrews, who wrote the best selling novel, is low key without trying to tell the audience how to feel. The director of photography shows off Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, almost always in a glow of light, even in the night scenes.\r I laughed once and that was the boys film take-off of \u201cMidnight Cowboy\u201d  with the \u201cEverybody\u2019s Talking\u201d theme song and, for a comedy, laughing once is not a good endorsement.\r I left the theatre wondering whatever happened to the girl who got stood up on prom night--maybe that\u2019s the sequel?"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Film script tries too hard.  It's not a bad film, but the first 35-40 minutes is a bit weak, and generally it falls flat.  The characters are cardboard cut-out, and they're written to be more interesting than they are, for instance it's unbelievable that lead had a perfect intricate social system in school as it pretty much falls apart the moment you try to depict it on screen. Earl is written as a stereotypical 'black guy' with no depth. Lots of inconsistencies in the film, such as being raised on foreign speciality foods, but insulting people eating foreign speciality foods, and Greg's personality in general.  In fact pretty much all the characters are unlikeable.  Rachel's the most likeable character, but of course she would be as a Manic Pixie Dream Girl.\r Anything that pays homage to classic films seems to be massively overhyped by critics, and any drama about cancer seems to get massively overhyped too in the same way Be Kind Rewind (2008) was overhyped 7 years ago and 50/50 was overhyped 4 years ago. So this film, focusing on both, seems to be getting far more attention than I believe it deserves.  Honestly I don't see this being any better than 2002's A Night To Remember.\r That being said the short films (or at least what we as an audience get to see of them) are pretty cool, and honestly I'd have preferred if that took more of a centrepiece of the movie for the first half, and the characters developed more fluidly, as the actual script and characters is bland."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Earl\u201d suffers from too muchitis.

The film's eccentric humor is often clever and fun, although it sometimes try too hard. Once the story hits rocky ground, things quickly fall into emotional drama.

This is a comedy, a quirky comedy but its very much a cringe-enducing form of comedy - a sort of dark comedy very much about social awkwardness, the pitfalls of being less than the all popular guy at the end of high school, i.e. secondary school. There isn't a laughter track or anything like that. It features narration, which is done very much in a blase, whatever, lets just explain this and then I'll move on and get out of your way, kind of a way. It has the feel of an indie cult classic, although I don't honestly remember when I first heard about it but I did enjoy it.Greg has an interesting hobby, which is making parodies of classic films with who he calls his co-worker Earl, rather than a friend. These are obviously done on a much, much lower budget and we're shown a number of covers for said films, which have quite funny word pun type titles, such as 'Rosemary Baby Carrots', 'Brew Velvet' and 'A Sockwork Orange'. I found the clips of said film parodies quite amusing and endearing to an extent - their made via puppet/stop motion animation styles, think papier mache props and the like.I felt sorry for Greg, as I can fairly easily remember what its like to feel like an awkward outsider at school, as he's clearly shown to be. It is quite a quirky film and it reminded me a bit of Napolean Dynamite, although the main character isn't as comic and doesn't stand out in the way that the titular character of that film did.Cast wise, Greg is played by Thomas Mann. He seems pretty much like a regular joe American mid teen. He comes across as relatively apathetic - I'm not sure how else I could describe him. Meanwhile, Earl is played by RJ Cyler, Olivia Cooke plays said dying girl Rachel and Molly Shannon plays Denise.I liked the way the film comes across, with numerous new scenes starting with text across the screen saying the name of that new scene, basically saying what Greg was thinking at that time, such as 'the time Rachel had just started treatment', 'the time I felt so awkward I just had to say something' (as if that only ever happens once, eh?). Content wise, the film features mild sex references and partial nudity. There are instances of mild violence but nothing gorey or graphic is shown as such. There is some swearing and drug reference are also made but otherwise there's little likely to offend people, although obviously the story and themes are pretty sobering and sad. The film has been given a 12 rating due to this.I think it says something about inevitability - its quite a sobering thought. Its definitely (inevitably) not a laugh out loud hilarious type of a film but I did find some parts amusing, although I accept it won't appeal to everyone. I wouldn't say its entirely a drama film, there is a fair amount of quirkiness present - its a bit hard to describe, other than a quirky indie comedy/drama film.Some of the music played was surprisingly distinctive.Tracks featured include In Dreams by Roy Orbison, Trouble by Cat Stevens and I'll Come Running by Brian Eno. Some well known classical pieces played include the Ride of the Valkyries and a few piano pieces which I have no idea what their called.I'd recommend this film, as I found it to be an amusing, quirky, somewhat thought provoking film, one which I imagine quite a few people could relate to. Its an interesting watch, so I'd recommend it on that basis."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Really a brilliant movie characters were very realistic and we're portrayed beautifully there is no cheesy romantic side to this film which I really like , cause in the end that's not what always happens .Olivia cooke , Thomas mann and rj cyler were brilliant this is a must watch very realistic teen movie that every teenager should check out"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Walks a fine line between poignant and chessy, and on the whole it stays on the right side.A touching movie, with just the right amount of humour."}], "recommendations": ["the_edge_of_seventeen", "moonrise_kingdom", "eddie_the_eagle", "10_things_i_hate_about_you", "the_spectacular_now", "the_fault_in_our_stars", "instant_family", "lady_bird", "the_perks_of_being_a_wallflower", "the_upside", "the_big_sick", "booksmart", "paddington_2", "the_king_of_staten_island", "me_before_you", "groundhog_day", "the_intern", "the_royal_tenenbaums", "eternal_sunshine_of_the_spotless_mind", "silver_linings_playbook", "little_miss_sunshine", "christopher_robin", "hugo", "palm_springs", "jojo_rabbit"]}
