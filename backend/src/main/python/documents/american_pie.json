However Jim's dance was funny, Eugene Levy is hilarious as always and the part where Jim ran across the streets to get to his house was funny. It was funny when he jumped and landed in the bush on his lawn. Besides all of that this movie belongs in the trash bin."

      "text": "This film tells the story of four teenagers seeking to lose their virginity before the end of high school. Directed by Paul and Chris Weitz, has a script by Adam Herz and has the participation of Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas and other actors.Sex has long ceased to be a taboo but it's not easy for a parent to discuss this topic with a son or daughter. It's part of life and it happens sooner in our times but there are clear boundaries between a healthy sexuality and a dissolute life. This has always been my personal opinion and I am sure that sex is good since it's lived with awareness, responsibility and maturity. And unfortunately, this message of maturity is totally absent of this film, that seeks to do comedy with immaturity and obsession with sex. For the guys in this movie, fu...ng is what matters, even if with an apple pie! It's the clash between a generation that didn't talk about sex and a generation that only talks and thinks about it, overcoming the barriers of shamelessness and making sexuality an animal obsession and an objective in itself. What saddens me most is to see that our adolescents (both boys and girls) are increasingly look like the characters in this film. Make it a comedy is not funny and doesn't help us to show the error that is to have this mentality. We are creating sexual perverts, and movies like this only contribute and profit from it.This film is the paradigm of teen film, one of the most stupid and insipid film genres created for the seventh art. Decidedly, the movie industry is able to reward us with masterpieces in the same way that we can throw up on the popcorn. Who have children, keep this film (and all it's sequels and spin-offs) prudently away from their eyes for the sake of their proper sex education. And who does not have... see this film only if you are completely brainless and like jokes involving human excreta and body fluids."

      "text": "There are some scenes in American Pie that are amusing. One scene that I found funny was the scene where Jim is dancing for Nadia. He doesn't realize they're being watched on the internet by others. He has a webcam and everyone is watching them through a link. Jim sends the link to everyone so they then have access to his webcam. He's only supposed to send the link to his friend's but he addresses the email wrong. Jim blows his shot with Nadia, then at school the next day everyone knows about his failure. He doesn't catch on to the fact that many people were watching them instantly but he does. Some acting in the movie was well done like Alyson Hannigan as the band geek and Eugene Levy's role as Jim's father. Overall though American Pie fails to be a hilarious, smart comedy. It is mildly amusing but mostly lame due to the crudeness of the sexual content and the gross out gags that misfire."

Of course im not insisting you guys to watch it if you don't like teen movies but its classic of this kind of comedy.I mean it! This might look little bit stupid because its like a \"stupid comedy\" Thats how i like to call movies like this.Actually they aren't stupid at all it's very hard to create jokes like this and make a movie like this.But I could hardly recommend this movie if you are looking for different kind of comedy something opposite from teens movie like good rated movie with good well known actor and a good storyline or a family comedy because it would be pretty weird watching movies with your children or with your parent (depends who you are). This movie is way different is about teenagers life, andtheir jokes. I could say this was one of the best of this kind ofcomedy i have ever seen! if someone asks for a comedy about teens firstmovie i say is \"American pie\". This movie would be best if you'relooking for something really easy and very hilarious to watch as Isaid already. Thanks for reading"

Personally, I preferred the second one too the first, as everyone was much more relaxed and knew each other, making the movie flow better. Don't get me wrong, this one certainly had it's funny moments, but in my estimation it wasn't as good as the second one. Jason Biggs  Alyson Hannigan are hilarious, but for all they bring to the table, bad actors like Eddie Kay Thomas and Chris Klein take away, making the good performances moot. American Pie is a classic teen comedy about sex and it ushered in a new era in comedy that's still relevant today. It has the raunchy, crazy, good looking youth we see in today's comedy, but unfortunately also has some really lame jokes and bad acting, that thankful went out with the nineties."
