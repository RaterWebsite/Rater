Also John Malkovich would be my choice, hands down, for best supporting actor. He is so great in every movie he has been in. The movie runs 2 hours 20 minutes and holds your interest from beginning to end. A thriller/drama based on a true story from a happening in L.A. California in 1929-30. (Where do they find so many of the automobiles from that period). The directing, the flash backs, the dialog...the story holds your total interest for the entire length of this movie.

Interestingly, I knew little about the film and did not know who had directed it while watching, and was mildly shocked at the end to see Clint Eastwood's name roll through the credit as director. As much as I loved \"Unforgiven\", you, Clint, are unforgiven for this horrible mess of a film. Grossly overwritten, every line tries it's damnedest to impart extreme gravitas or pith. And every one of these horribly cheesy lines is delivered by a walking piece of cardboard character. Jolie, cue the tears, nominated for best actress? Please, maybe a nomination for best weight-loss not required by a role. The only engaging character of the movie was the killer himself, who imbued his part with the appropriate creepiness that this movie fully deserved. I honestly, honestly have never seen a movie with this level of budget, actors and director be so miserably overwritten, consequently overacted, with an enraging attempt at sentimentality as it desperately tries to salvage itself through emotional manipulation strangely in bed with pure shock value."

      "text": "This is a movie that cannot make up its mind. One minute it focuses on the distraught mother of a missing child, the next it turns its befuddled eye onto a corrupt police system and a crusading priest, then shifts to the horrors of a mental institution where the main character is hailed a conquering hero for her stand against the injustices imposed on its patients, and finally the movie becomes a courtroom drama. The story is adapted from a true story, but the film awkwardly changes the chronology so that civil and criminal case are tried simultaneously. Obviously this was done for dramatic emphasis but it just doesn't work. In fact, very little in this movie does, which may be a good thing because I left feeling totally detached from the horrors of the narrative. Save your money. This is not one of Clint Eastwood's better movies."

      "text": "Where to start? Jolie was miscast, but maybe they wanted to make an action flick when the project started, had her sign up, and by mistake started working of a script for a totally different movie. It might explain the title. Or what about the irritating self awareness of John Malkovich who'd you, at any point in the movie, expect to break the rule of the 'fourth wall', look smugly into a camera and tell the audience that he's really pleased with his performance so far. Story wise: horrible, unbelievable plot turns, starting right of the bat when a seemingly intelligent woman is given the wrong boy back, her supposed son, who disappeared a few months earlier. The boy is not her son, she takes him home anyway...\u00c2\u00a4\u00c2\u00a4 Really? \u00c2\u00a4\u00c2\u00a4 The story continuous with Jolie trying to explain to the world that the boy is an impostor who doesn't even match her son's height to which a dentist and a school teacher are willing to testify. Why family members, neighbors, school chums, the family physician, the baby sitter and E.T. the Extraterrestrial weren't asked to help resolve the obvious misconception on the part of the police, was conveniently left out of the tale completely. No, in stead of taking the boy into custody and resuming the search for the real son, the police keep pushing her into believing it actually is her son after which the woman finds herself in a poorly copied tale by Kafka. From this point on the movie reveals itself for what it was intended to be. An endless string of manipulative scenes drenched in an Oscar vinaigrette in both the melodramatic writing and the obnoxiously polished cinematography with a fetish-like attention to props. Some movies get Oscar nods, but this one actually nods back."

Jeffrey Donovan is unable to do a Southern accent, among others. His acting is sub-par. Although I knew prior to seeing the movie what it was about the title \"Changeling\" led me to believe it was about aliens. The economy had tanked or was tanking and the real estate plunged so no one wanted to see a depressing movie. If it were not for all the aforementioned...it still would have bombed."

He always makes sure the dimmest person in the audience is never in doubt of which characters are 100% good and which ones are 100% evil. Every single employee at the psych hospital acts like they're villians in a Superman comic book. With the exception of Jolie, the film was filled with MOVIE characters, not real people. The irony is that this is a true story, yet I never believed a minute of Eastwood's film. He had a fascinating story to work with, and I'm glad to know the story, but as a film it was little better than a made-for-TV movie. He seems to be afraid of challenging his audience, so he ends up insulting our intelligence. At the end he spoon-feeds us even our emotional response, making it clear that we're supposed to feel good about the outcome, even though, when you think about it, it's really not a happy ending."

Albeit an unbelievable story, I never felt convinced that Jolie's character was distraught over losing her son, beyond the occasional outburst, \"I WANT MY SON BACK!\" I never felt like I understood what it must have felt like to lose a child. The film spent too much time on the details of mother vs LAPD and lacked development of the emotionality of the situation. For example, in Million Dollar Baby, when Hilary Swank's character gets sucker-punched, we all felt sucker-punched.I felt like I was watching this story take place from the bleachers, which was unexpected coming from Eastwood.

So as I start Changeling, I found myseld getting frustrated and very annoyed by the movie. I was just waiting for Angelina to start yelling at the police, but she talks so softly, I couldn't relate to how she was acting, so passive and non insistent, OH that annoyed me.

His eye has captured the look and feel of Los Angeles circa 1930 perfectly and his score sets the mood beautifully. Angelina Jolie proves that she was indeed robbed of an Oscar nomination last year for her performance in A Mighty Heart, because here, while she is again very good, she really just has to deliver about 12 versions of a line with \"My Son\" in it, but because of the prestige of Mr. Eastwood, she's more likely to get her nod this year for Changeling as a pay back for last year. The rest of the cast are all good but the story turns it focus a few times too many to make this the next Eastwood Oscar juggernaut, but what do I know, I still believe A Perfect World was Clint's Best!!"

He takes a subject matter that he could have knocked out of the park and somehow manages to bog it down with sterotyping. 30 minutes into the film we know where this movie is going. He captures the late 1920's on camera perfectly but yet does not take us into the character's development for doing what they did. It is almost surreal as the audience craves more depth but yet it is sorely lacking. AJ meanders along searching for her lost son but yet we know nothing about the woman. The LA Police are corrupt but we don't understand why they take the stance they did in the Court of Public Opinion. At the very end of the move (spoilers omitted) the one eyewitness who could place closure on the matter by simply asking was anyone recaptured is never asked. You leave the theater wanting more."
