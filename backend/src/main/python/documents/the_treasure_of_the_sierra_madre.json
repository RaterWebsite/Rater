      "text": "procrastinating the humane accuracy and lunacy..The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre4 Out Of 5The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre is a tale about three partners going after the treasure and the irrevocable journey or adventure that it brings along with it. The inner politics depicted among the greedy friends and the good old \"morality\" conflicts that it raises, is the ingenious yet simply sensible take of the makers especially when the heat is communicated directly to the audience, it gets better as it ages on screen. It is rich on technical aspects like sound effects, background score, editing and art design. The primary reason the feature offers a satisfactory outcome is that not only is it unpredictable but is justifying with genuine reasoning which is the soul in here. The structure of the script may be familiar but its additional and side characters does make it worth keeping the audience engaged offering them enough work and art to explore in it. John Houston; the screenwriter-director, uses its smart adaptation wisely and brilliant execution skills on creating the anticipated vision on screen. The performance is decently acted by Humphrey Bogart and Tim Holt but the real gem of the feature is Walter Houston who gives a memorable performance as a supporting cast. The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre is an interesting take on morality while procrastinating the humane accuracy and lunacy on its backdrop that ticks loud and clear all through the way."
