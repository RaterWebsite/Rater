      "text": "As a lifelong Stooges fan I can say The Three Stooges is a proper, if a bit wrong-headed, homage to Moe, Larry and Curly.  There were many, many moments in the film in which I had to sort of rub my eyes a bit as I had to tell myself, \"These aren't the originals.\"  I think the performances go beyond impersonation.  Especially Moe and Larry.  Do you belief in possession...or in-habitation?  Well if you know the Stooges and see The Three Stooges, there are moments when the performances will leave you with a gaping awe-provoked maw.\r And then there are the other moments when you will be slack-jawed at how terrible some of the other moments are.  While I have seen folks say that \"you can't outdo the originals\" and such like that...it isn't the moments when the Three are on screen that are the real problem.  It's everything else.  Yes, you get the fan service.  You get the bad puns.  You get Larry getting something totally wrong, or playing with something he shouldn't.  You get Moe being Moe.  You get Curly being both the innocent and the Robin Goodfellow.  It's all there, and you should expect that.  There's some modern displacement in there as well and yes, they should know what a smart-phone is, but they have been raised in an Orphanage, so give that stuff a break.  Heh...\"Hey, Jumbotron, have you seen...\" oh that had my theater rolling.\r But you get everything else that has to plague a movie like this.  I recalled Jim Carrey's Grinch movie while watching what could only be called \"filler\".  That cinematic suppuration had to include sort of back story to the Grinch, he had to have some sort of motivation to being the Grinch...as if just being the Grinch isn't good enough...well, the Farrelly bros know the Stooges are just the Stooges, there's no need for us to analyze them, to try and explore their dynamic.  And that is where the movie stumbles, steps on the hoe in the yard, gets the stick in the mush, falls over into the swimming pool and gets the rich patron of the social party wet.  But the Grinch was a movie...they had to have some filler.  But you didn't have to do that with the Stooges.\r I, and everyone in my theater, would have been pleased to have actually seen three Stooges shorts, instead of having a continuous movie broken up into three episodes.  Because trying to layer a narrative over a movie about the Stooges...while I can understand why they did it...and it stinks of studio pressure from Puddinheads wearing suits...it just doesn't work.  And herein we see the inherent problem with making a Three Stooges movie.  You would have been better off making a few Shorts to show in front of other movies (or a teevee series) than trying to make a Three Stooges movie.  Yes, Sofia Vergera hams it up, so there's two other good things about the film.  But most everything else doesn't work.  Sorry.  They need to make a truncated edition where everything else is deleted.  No, don't break out into song just because you can sing and need an excuse for Curly to dance.  Yes, Larry's hair is weird...we get it.   But I can't give this anything less than an eight...why?  I'd be a chowderhead to give it anything less.  It's the Stooges.  It really was...Yes...Curly's too tall/big.  They're all too tall, etc.  But this is an homage of the top order when we see the Stooges and their shtick.  Yes, there are moments when it becomes a bit much.  There are times when the \"violence\" becomes a bit too real, again for story purposes.  There's times modern sensibilities ruin the fun.  But trust me, when you see the Jersey Shore cast as Moe's mercy, and when the Kardasian joke hits like a 2 ton bag of flour...you'll get the funny.  Also stay into the credits for a bit of extra Stooges fun.\r Do I recommend it?...well, soit...oh, you saw that coming, didn't you, porcupines?  Why I oughta..."

Saw it last night with two 40 year old guys and 2 teenage boys. It was much better than I expected. One of those..\"so silly it's funny\" sort of movies. The adults appreciated it more than the kids. (adults laughing out loud funny). The three stars captured the characters perfectly (amazingly even). and there is a plot, and plot-twits even..kinda..(but that was secondary to me). TheF  Bros. caught the essenese of the stories and jokes. Much research must have gone into  it. (tough job, huh?) While the jokes are good, you have to enjoy slapstick humor. I now hope it does well enough for a sequel. Nothing offensive. There is a disclaimer at the end for kids NOT to do this at home. It wasn't needed in the 40's but I am kind of glad they included it in this day and age."

If you like The Three Stooges, you might like this movie. If you hadn't seen it, you should probably see the original show first before seeing the movie. I would give it 10 out of 10 but since it wasn't as funny as the original Three Stooges and Jersey Shore being in it, I'm only gonna give it an 8 out of 10. but still, I suggest seeing the movie."

I absolutely love each and every short that was made. I own all of them and even have many pieces of stooge memorabillia. I recently just returned from the middle east where I was sent when I joined the M.C.  When I returned I was delighted to hear about a tribute being made of the stooges by the Farrelly brothers. I went and saw the movie with my fiancee, who is also and avid stooge fan, and 30 minutes into the movie we left. Why? This series of short tributes was a travesty to say the least. I have been shot and hit by pieces of shrapnel and didn't shed a tear. This tragic farce of a film actually made me so angry that I cried knowing that the real stooges would never have written such a despicable film and that people would actually have the to allow this trash to even go to script. In closing this film is the next worst thing next to the extermination of the Jewish people during the holocaust and if Peter and Bobby  Farrelly had any sense they would erase any idea of making more of these short films. They are an insult to stooge fans everywhere."

The slapstick was really the only part that really stuck out in the film and the famous co-stars behind it. At least this film was better than any Alvin and the Chipmunks movie. I wouldn't be surprised if they came out with a sequel but I am not sure who would really see it... just more older people and their grandchildren. See it if you want to re-live the old show.

      "text": "Playing out more like a tribute than an originally-drawn twist on a classic, 'Stooges' is an imitation piece that fails to offer anything new and germane to modern times; its material, embarrassingly camp and derivative, feels too overly forced and enervating to connect audiences with humor outdated some 80-odd years. Though the \"Big-3\" (Hayes, Sasso, and Diamantopoulos) turn in first rate impersonations, carrying out the same aching eye-pokes, excruciating hair pulls, bone-crushing skull slaps, and nasty knuckle sandwiches, not to mention the familiar dissonant squabbling and airy mindlessness, they don't even bother to deviate from just that: impersonations; the characters have no intention to extend themselves beyond a 'Mad-TV'-esque imitation-comedy-skit--offering little else than ephemerally visible-but-not-felt- smiles, followed by long-lasting regret and discontent. And, adding to the feeling are cheap laughs, underdeveloped cameo appearances from modern \"characters\" ('Jersey Shore' cast members among them), cheap and flatly-shot scenes, desultorily unapt classic-rock scores, as well as reproachably classless, and dismal attempts to appeal to contemporary audiences--breast and bathroom jokes with references to drug use--all of which disceptively slide past the approbated PG-rating. Did the fillmmakers fail to realize their forbear was clean? Ultimately, the Farrelly brothers, regardless of their own inspirations, don't create anything inspiring--they create a travesty--and participate in an exercise of fully-fledged defaming. It's \"Soitenly\" despicable."

The actors did an impressive performance, and worth seeing on stage. Perhaps the slapstick emotion does not make a good combination with digital cinema, but the reincarnation moves facetiously, and could be considered an extravagance in the choreography of the slips they have. There are times that it is curious trio's encounter with technology and the modern era, and the excuse that always lived in the orphanage, away from the city, could be a great distraction from their uncertainty. Details are somewhat inconsistent in his script, but the comedy moves so that the audience laughter could distract from the small details of continuity. But I can assure you it is entertaining at many times, and may also find curious references to memorable films. The use of Jersey Shore in the film could be seen as a strange encounter between two generations as the youth group appears as a funny oopart for the old audience."

But more impressive to me was that it not only had a PLOT, but it explained it well without becoming too boring. I feel like most directors would have spliced up this thing -and to be honest, I don't think it would have worked as well that way.Also, this film is pretty clean by today's standards. No cuss words that I can remember, and no bathroom humor (unlike Adam Sandler flicks, *ahem*).Some people on here have complained that the story drags a bit, but I disagree. I felt like the movie kept throwing things at me to spice it up. This movie may not be for everyone, but it was refreshing to see this style of comedy again. I'm not saying I want to watch it over and over, but I think it's definitely worth seeing once, even if you're only sort-of intrigued by the idea of The Three Stooges.I (finally) saw it today out of curiosity and because I'm a Will Sasso fan. We have a local $2 theater that picks up movies after they leave most theaters, and I'm so glad I caught this one. To hear the kids crack up at this stuff is pretty much priceless.All-around this movie seems to aim for the kids (with the physical comedy), but has enough wit, puns, and story to appeal to adults, too. As long as you don't expect any explosions, I think most adult males could enjoy this. I give this a 7.5. It's the greatest Three Stooges film that will likely ever be made.

One thing bad about the movie is it didn\u2019t have enough jokes they should have added more in as there was only a joke about every 2-3 mins."
