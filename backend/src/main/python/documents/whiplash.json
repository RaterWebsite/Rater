He was a real SOB to the extreme.Why any student would put up with such an abusive teacher is why many an athlete put up with a tyrannical coach. It's a way to make it into the big leagues or so they are led to believe. This was the most intense movie I've seen in a long time. I was drained when I left the theatre."

The story is compelling all the way through and the brilliant direction along with the clever dialogue and occasionally humorous moments the film stayed fresh all the way through. The scenes get intense in this film as you watch a young man struggling to become the best jazz drummer in the world. It's an ambition that we can all relate to: to strive to be best at something. This is what makes this story so encapsulating, you want him to become the best! Loved the film in everyway! A must watch! Emotional, frantic, and memorable!"

      "text": "Damien Chazelle's \"Whiplash\" is a harrowing film that explores the complicated relationship between Andrew, a young jazz drummer who aspires to become the best, and Fletcher, a famed conductor who relentlessly pushes his students to their limits in search for his ideal musician. Actors Teller and Simmons, who played the roles of Andrew and Fletcher respectively, have shown quality performances as their strong jazz chemistry really left an impression; Simmons's oscar-winning performance as Fletcher is straight out deserved, as he performs his role with utter power and absolute dominance. The plot is packed with tension and drama as the pace consistently gains momentum until it all explodes with a refreshing bang at the movie's satisfying grand final act. With excellent visuals, superb directing, an engaging story supplied by masterful actors, \"Whiplash\" definitely has its place in my top 5 movies of 2014."

The movie may have a very specific focus and be nothing earth-shattering on the intellectual side, but it's worth several Oscar nominations. The music is fantastic. See it on the big screen.\r As for the controversy around the abusive teacher, I would say that it's not necessary to feel that the teacher is justified or unjustified, good or evil, effective or hindering, in order to enjoy the movie and find interesting food for thought in it. If a semi-vicious teacher who, in the real world, would overstep the bounds of ethics and even effective technique, is a flaw in the movie, then it's not a damning one."

Miles Teller is a total revelation to me in this and shows how such a young actor can be an outstanding one already. Amazing performance. A crime that he has not been nominated for best actor at the Oscars. Co-lead actor J. K. Simmons is equally great and will win his Oscar for supporting role no doubt. And the film does this with just two main characters, music and a great screenplay. No more is needed when we are talking about real art. It will be impossible because of politics, but if this film gets the Oscar for best picture it will be the biggest deserved surprise in Oscar history. A must see!"

Simmons makes the most of his opportunity.\r Andrew (Miles Teller) is a freshman jazz drummer at a top music school.  Terence Fletcher (JK Simmions) teaches the school\u2019s best students, mostly upper classmen, but he is also the teacher everyone fears.  Fletcher\u2019s motto is that good musicians don\u2019t become great musicians unless they are pushed hard to do so, but the techniques used by Fletcher to motivate his students fall somewhere between extreme and brutal.\r Andrew comes from a nice middle class family in the burbs.  Family dinner conversations have a competitive air in which the small college athletic successes of his siblings dominate.   Andrew is driven to succeed as a jazz drummer, but he is also young and impressionable.  He notices that in addition to being a tough teacher, Fletcher appears to also have a caring and a compassionate side to him.  Andrew buys into Fletcher\u2019s belief system and commits to doing whatever it takes to be the best, including making a decision to terminate a budding relationship with his new girlfriend.\r The question of whether Fletcher is a good guy or a bad guy will have you on the edge of your seat until the movie\u2019s dramatic conclusion.  You don\u2019t need to like jazz music to like this film.  The terrific music is just a bonus.  Director Damien Chazelle\u2019s pacing is right on target and a couple of minor plot faults near the end of the movie aren\u2019t enough throw this fine film off tempo."

      "text": "Terence Fletcher: \"There are no two words in the English language more harmful than good job\".\r Whiplash follows are main character Andrew Neyman who is a young jazz drummer, single-minded in his pursuit to rise to the top of his elite east coast music conservatory. Plagued by the failed writing career of his father, Andrew hungers day and night to become one of the greats. Terence Fletcher, an instructor equally known for his teaching talents as for his terrifying methods, leads the top jazz ensemble in the school. Fletcher discovers Andrew and transfers the aspiring drummer into his band, forever changing the young man's life.\r Okay let me just start off with this. You had no idea how much I was really looking forward to Whiplash. This was on my movies to check out list, because I heard nothing but positive things from this movie and I heard a lot of people described this film has the Full Metal Jacket but with no war or guns, but with music and well... drums. I think Whiplash and Birdman was the two movies I wanted to see before making my best movies of the year list, because who knows they might make the list. I haven't seen Birdman yet but will do soon, but I finally had the chance to see Whiplash and my god this movie was just so spectacularly flawless in many ways. Whiplash is the best move of 2014.\r J.K. Simmons in this movie probably pulls of the best performance in he's career. Every word that came out of his mouth didn't feel like he was reading from the script then act it out, no, I felt every angry punch of words that came out of him, because it was real and not fake. I didn't see J.K. Simmons just playing a movie character in this movie, no he was the freaking Fletcher.\r Now let's talk about Terence Fletcher: The best way to describe Fletcher to those who haven't seen the film yet, well his like Gny. Sgt. Hartman from Full Metal Jacket. He has the best lines, when his on screen your locked on and his also like the kind of person that would be somebody's worse nightmare to have for a boss. This guy doesn't just like music, he breaths music and he wants his band to do perfect. His opinion and his look on music is another thing why I didn't flat out just hated him, I actually understood him. He made a very good point about how people will comment on you act and say \"You did a good job\", and yes I did use the words \"you did a great job\", n my past reviews but now I'm never going to use it ever again after this movie.\r Miles Teller was another stand out performances in this movie, and just like Foxcatacher where Channing Tatum was so over looked by his performance, Miles Teller has proved himself to be more then a teen in a movie that will be forgotten and so would he, but no Miles Teller played this character so brilliantly he could become the next big thing. Now his character in this movie has the love of the true art of music and you can see that he will wants to tell people his love for music, but when the harsh life of reality comes crashing into him it's truly heartbreaking to see his struggle and effort just not being good enough, and Teller played this character so realistic and so brilliantly flawless.\r The directing and the writing in this was just....perfect. Damien Chazelle directed this movie and written it and man did he do it with style and passion to tell a story about two strong music buffs battling out and he freaking nailed it.\r This movie also had probably the best finale that I've seen in years. My nails were digging into the seat. I didn't dare to look away not for one moment, not for one second. I was simply locked on and when it was over... I'm kidding you I actually clapped towards the end of this movie. Now the biggest cliche that I always hear from critics when their talk about a different movies and their use words like \"You will clap at the end\", but you don't, or \"You will feel inspired after the film\", and I you don't. But Whiplash actually did make me feel inspirited towards the end and made me clap. It's message of not giving up and the dream that you been chancing for isn't just going to come to you. Movies like Pride, freedom Writers and all that such never ever give me that inspiring feeling inside of me, until I watched this movie.\r For problems: The movie had it slow parts and that's it really.\r Whiplash is a movie that everybody should see. This isn't just a popcorn movie where you come and put you legs up and laugh a couple of times, no this movie reaches out to people out there that have the same problems that these character's have, with their passion of what their what to do in life get's over shadowed by something you don't want to do and this movie get's it right. So go and see if you have the chance."

This, along with films like The Social Network, The dark Knight , are changing modern cinema as we know it (if they haven't already). Like the seventies film-makers like Kubrick, Scorsese and Coppola influenced a whole new generation with the possibilities of cinema , The above mentioned films have influenced me and hopefully my generation of moviegoers and I hope will continue to do so. The thing about Whiplash for me is that It feels pure. It has razor sharp focus on it's characters and in what type of film it wants to be. Most films these days always feel bogged down by baggage that diminish the experience whether it be Political and sentimental in nature . Not because they're in the film but they feel extremely heavy handed and half baked. This is the sort of film that really gets to me. Films that feel personal and close to the heart and don't preach to you , cater to you or talk down to you.One of my all time favorites.I have nothing to say about J.K Simmons enigmatic performance, The brilliant Script, Miles Tellers resonant lead because it's already been said , they're all Awesome. In the end this is a film That me and many other people have connected to , even though we don't have jazz in our lives , Even though we didn't have a foul-mouthed teacher pushing us, or even though we may have modest expectations of our lives.  that should tell you all you need to know about the film really 10/10"

      "text": "\"Whiplash\" stars J.K. Simmons and Miles Teller in this story of a would be jazz drummer and his over zealous teacher/conductor in an elite and upscale music conservatory. Written and directed by Damien Chazille, this is a film that will appeal to lovers of jazz as it represents some of the best musical renditions ever seen on the movie screen. It is also a film that raises the question as to how far a teacher should go to \"bring out the best\" in his or her student. Messrs. Simmons and Teller are superb in the roles they play as they participate in some of the most intense student/teacher scenes one will ever see. Adding to their credibilty, we find out that in real life Mr. Teller studied drums from age 15 and Mr. Simmons holds degrees in voice, conducting and music from the University of Montana. As a result it\u2019s easy to understand the believability of their respective performances. Having myself played in studio bands under the stewardship of a number of quality professors, the film had a special meaning for me. But, alas, this is what may make this really good film a commercial mishap since it is not for everyone and, by its very subject matter, may exclude a significant part of the viewing public. I give the film a 9.0 because, seen out of context and apart from other films, it stands out as a true work of art. The caveat here, though, is that if intense musicology, training and signficant jazz performances are not the viewer\u2019s \"thing\", then this film will not be appreciated by him or her to the same extent as it was by me."

      "text": "Wow. That was so intense, yet so simplistic. Whiplash follows the story of a drum player played by Miles Teller. He's extremely relatable as he wants this as his career, and is working so hard to get there; a situation we've all been in. We also see that he is not handling the pressure that well. He's in debt, he's barely paying the rent and is verging insanity. From this we want him to succeed, as we see that he is a good guy, but his incredibly bad luck is just bringing him down; again another situation we've all been in. The humanisation of this character is so engaging that even if there was no plot or dialogue at all in the movie, it would still keep audiences in their seats. But that's not the case. The plot presented before us may be simple, but it's execution is stellar in every possible respect - from acting to cinematography to music; it simply is a masterpiece. The story comes into play when our main character is at the end of his rope and is a mer millimetre away from giving up. However, he gains hope again when he has the opportunity to study in a class taught by this legendary music teacher played by J.J Simons. He gets in, but gets way more than he bargains for. Simons teaching methods are extremely cruel and some what sadistic, using physical, verbal and psychological torture to motivate his students. In addition to this, Simons's performance is absolutely and utterly impeccable. At every given moment some sort of malice is shown by him, making you actually fear what he might put Teller through next. It's easily the best performance of the year and Simons definitely needs to win an oscar. The film also makes you continuously have conflicting opinions on this character. For example, Simons will often say utterly evil yet hilarious things, that makes you question your own morality by finding it funny. But the best thing about this character is how real he really is. We've all had some sort of intelligent, charismatic yet malevolent boss or teacher that we've hated with every morsel of our beings. However, the greatest part of this film is at the end. After around a month of all of this, Simons deems Teller ready to preform, but also warns him that if he messes this up, he will suffer beyond anything he's ever felt. Mix that with excellent camera work and thematic music, and you have one of the most tension filled scenes in the whole of film history. It takes you through the scene at such a methodical, slow pace that just builds an extreme level of suspense. Without a doubt Whiplash is one of the best, if not the best film of 2014."

It moves at a cracking pace, has some very smart dialogue and boasts a couple of very strong performances from Miles Teller and J K Simmons. However, it is almost a film of two halves. The set up, and then the revenge. The first half of the film, whilst good, feels somewhat contrived.\r Drum playing jazz fanatic Andrew (Teller) goes all out to impress respected but feared teacher Fletcher (Simmons) in the hope of joining the school band he leads. This he sees as his possible route to becoming one of the jazz greats. However, he hasn't bargained on the outrageous teaching methods employed by Fletcher which includes humiliating and even attacking his students. Their fragile interaction puts them on a collision course.\r Both performances are undoubtedly excellent, but Teller really has the more difficult role and stands tall against Simmons more obvious grandstanding. As the cruel and foul mouthed Fletcher, Simmons shouts, swears and screams a lot, much in the vein of an army drill instructor, but these outbursts sometimes have the effect of appearing phony and calculated, merely there to elicit laughs or rouse an audience. Like wise, Teller's acquisition, and subsequent ditching of a girl friend, and scenes of him pushing himself on the drums to the point that his hands become blistered and bloodied, strike false notes. Again,they feel like plot contrivances which, although demonstrating sacrifices made on route to success, actually feel included just to provide fuel for the film's better second half.\rThe final half hour is very satisfyingly concluded as the two actors dual it out to thrilling and nail biting effect. The film also benefits from a  great jazz score which permeates throughout and the film is briskly and imaginatively edited."

I don\u2019t know if Teller did his own drumming but if he did he deserves recognition for superb drumming.\r The supporting players from Paul Reiser as Andrew\u2019s father to Melissa Benoist who Andrew pursues, and then drops because she interferes with his drumming, along with the other students who play or compete with him are all topnotch .\r The music from the title song by the late great Hank Levy plus standards like \u201cCaravan\u201d and new music by Justin Hurwitz are all presented as jazz should be. It took me back to the jazz clubs on 52nd street, and in the Village, along with the sets at Birdland that I use to go to in New York City.\r The direction by Damien Chazelle is spot on and in his writing the screenplay he leaves out a few logical things but enhances the movie with a short 1 hour and 46 minutes.\r \u201cWhiplash\u201d is a winner all the way."

      "text": "How is it that 3 million dollars are converted into Whiplash, and yet it takes 220 to produce Avengers? This film is definitive proof that you don't need big names (although Miles Teller and JK Simmons kind of are) to get big performances - and that it doesn't all come down to production design and CGI and expensive shots to make a good movie.\r Accompanied by a humble, warmly-lit cinematography, Whiplash has all it takes to be one of the defining music films so far, thanks mainly to the cast and the script. The plot halts on issues of teacher-student relationships and the importance of commitment, but the open ending suggests that might not be enough still - in substance, there is no \"perfection\" ever, but you have to try.\r It's the inspiring yet abusive JK Simmons, with his somewhat witty insults and tight black T-shirt who makes the cut. Falling from heaven, repentance and redemption are all there. Watch it."

Simmons easily deliver intense, captivating, and certainly career-best performances, Simmons without a doubt deserving a shot at the best supporting actor Oscar! Teller's drumming skills are also mind-blowing and the story goes in so many unexpected directions and pulls plenty of shocks and surprises throughout leading up to one hell of a grand finale! Overall, easily one of the year's best and most powerful films!"

It's refreshing to see a movie that focuses on a subject like jazz drumming which doesn't get a whole lot of attention and other artistic ventures. Teller it is clearly a star on the rise. And JK Simmons is going to be justly rewarded for a masterful performance."

This was not the case with \"Whiplash\". It only made me feel pity, disgust and need to /facepalm. I admit, this movie might be considered edgy (because it shows a sensitive topic) and maybe a work of art, but it lacked essence and relatability. Characters seem like empty and underdeveloped canvases. This film relied too much on shock value."

      "text": "This cliched after-school special of a movie plays like a cross between Black Swan and Mr. Holland's Opus and every other \"struggling genius underdog\" movie ever made.  Fine performances from Teller and Simmons and incredibly tight editing can't make up for the thread-bare story and the unlikable, unrealistic characters.  If you're interested in jazz or in drumming, seek out a local music venue and treat yourself to something real."

      "text": "I\u2019m have mixed feelings on this film. The acting is great with J.K. Simmons delivering as always, there is a great motivation story in here, the main character is relatable for a good chunk of the movie, and the film looks and sounds great. All of this makes it so frustrating when the film gets to the third act. The protagonist becomes unrelatable and unlikeable when you see how overly driven he is to succeed and when the film ended I wanted to distance myself from being like him as much as possible. The film also sends a mixed message telling viewers to work hard and succeed but also shows that downsides of overly driving yourself. The third act takes what could\u2019ve been a wonderful film and just makes it pretty good. This is so heartbreaking for me as I was loving this movie for a while and then the third act came and it just made me want to punch the lead in the face. Now as I am writing this I have yet to see the reviews so I do not know if other critics feel the same way about the film but it wouldn\u2019t surprised me if it got tons of acclaim and no one addressed it. In regards to whether or not I\u2019d recommend the film I\u2019d say see it for the first two-thirds but brace yourself after that because you might not like what you see."

The title might refer to one of the songs from the film, but as the closing credits roll, it isn't surprising I grabbed the back of my neck and wondered what hit me."
