It's not perfect for sure, but still very enjoyable. I love Alexander the Great and I have studied and read about him a lot and it's wrong to say that this film is historically inaccurate. They mixed a bit of legend into the story. Like his mother being a kind of witch and him being Zeus's son... but obviously we all know this kind of stuff is just the legend to make his character more grand. But the facts are true, the film is historically accurate enough. I especially liked that they didn't create a theory about his death. We do not know the cause of his death, so the movie doesn't make it clear either and just leaves the viewer guessing, just as historians are guessing. My only problem is that they portrayed him more emotional than he probably was. The battle scenes are great, violent yet beautiful and realistic as well. The music is composed by Vangelis,so yeah...epic, probably there is no need to say more. The scenery is beautiful as well. The kid who portrayed young Alexander provided a surprisingly good performance that I usually don't expect from kids. Not to mention that he actually resembles Colin Farrell. Probably it's due to the make-up and hair, but my point is it's actually believable that the kid is his younger self and that's quite rare in movies. In many other films I hate flashbacks, because it usually kills the illusion that the kid is so obviously not the same person. Not in this film,though. I could keep on complementing certain parts of this film, but what's essential is that it has enough good to keep you entertained despite the bad parts.( I am aware that the editing is kinda ****"}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Bad movie, boring, flat."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "I found this movie to have great costume and action.

Colin F makes a great job at portraying Alexander. This is how a historical movie should be made. Accuracy neatly balanced with entertainment value.Also an answer to the reviewer called \"Christo\": For someone who supposedly studied Alexander for 2 years, you have very little knowledge of Alexander and the times he lived in. This is a laugh: \"You must understand that during those times, a person who loved men and women was respected greatly because he/she loved each and every single one of God's children.\". God's children? Since neither Christianity or Islam had been even founded, I suppose you are either claiming that all Greeks including Alexander were, what...? Jewish? Polytheism ruled back then. There would be no \"God's children\". You are either very ignorant to the times of Alexander or simply trying to apply your beliefs on a time and place where that belief didn't even exist."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I just cannot understand why people are saying that Alexander is a terrible movie! I have studied Alexander The Great for about 2 years now, and i have written numerous essays about him. This movie depicts the EXACT history of his wonderful and great life. I think that people were expecting to see a bloodfest. If you want to see a stupid gory movie, go and rent freddy vs. jason. Alexander is an historical epic about the greatest warrior to ever live. I think that people were taken aback by Alexanders bisexuality. You must understand that during those times, a person who loved men and women was respected greatly because he/she loved each and every single one of God's children. You cant think of it as modern times. The mentality back then was VERY different. So when you watch this movie, judge Alexander as a loving, yet strong person. I would like to say that the acting in this movie was riveting. No one overacted. Anglina Jolie betrayed Olmypia perfectly, passionate yet overpowering over her son. She had a perfect Greek accent, and i would know this since i am greek and lived there for sometime! So everyone who say's their accents are stupid are wrong! You have no fricken idea about how they are suppose to sound! Colin Farrel is a wonderful actor, he captured Alexander's passion and his pain. Also, i wanted to add that Anthony Hopkins was not given the props he should be given. He narrated the movie with such fatigue and (here it is again, lol) passion. So please, disregard all of the stupid and idiotic bad comments made by some of these people! Go and watch Alexander with an open mind and expect an epic with just enough battle, history, and love to make it a spectacular film.

We all know that Alexander \"batted for both teams\", so to speak... and frankly nobody cares. Oliver Stone obviously felt like using this aspect would be more compelling to audiences than the greatness that Alexander was revered for. I suppose the only aspect of this movie that is worth mentioning, is the effort put into the photography and scenery... it was beautifully shot in some instances, but that is about all it had going for it. It was a pain to sit through, to be perfectly honest. I have never been to a movie theatre, where a movie was actually BOOed at the end. I just think it was so terrible to take a story as great as that of Alexanders conquest, and turn it into some sort of 'suprise' tactic using his bisexuality as the main pull for the movie. Rediculous - poor acting, poor storyline - it was so annoying to even want to pay attention to the plot, that you just want to get up and leave. A huge waste of time, dont even bother renting it - the special on Alexander the Great featured on the Discovery channel was 10X as entertaining, and I am not just saying that...

Much of the visual imagery of the film is breathtaking, such as the stunning battles of Gaugamela and Hydaspes, but also the beautifully filmed crowded cityscapes of ancient Babylon, and the dramatic scenery along the route of Alexanders conquests. Some reviewers have complained about the flashback structure, and use of Irish & British accents to differentiate the Macedonian and Greek characters. Neither device bothered me once I realised their function ... I dont think I'd have been able to tell a Macedonian accent from a Greek one otherwise ! But these are minor digressions. The strength of the film is its epic portrayal of the experiences of Alexander and his men. The Battle of Gaugamela in particular is possibly the best reconstruction of an ancient battle committed to film, seamlessly guiding the viewer from an ingenious strategic battlefield overview, down to the tactical manouvers of the opposing forces, and the brutal reality of the bloody hand to hand combat. I was shaking with adrenalin from reliving this brilliantly choreographed confrontation. More poetic and still relevant is the clash of cultures illustrated by Alexander on his beloved horse Bucephalus and the terrifying War Elephants of the Punjabi King Porus. Alexanders dream of uniting the diverse peoples of the world under one unified culture is one we're still wrestling with, and is reflected in microcosm in his own relationships with his parents and lovers ! Its such an epic story that perhaps there was an inevitable tightrope to be walked by the films central characters as they try to carry sufficient gravitas for the themes involved, whilst keeping them real, which has led to accusations of hammy acting. I didnt share this feeling though, these real titans of human history are surely entitled to some Shakespearian hyperbole ... and it was probably a genuine requirement for charismatic leaders inspiring their followers ! I WAS inspired !"}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Worst ever. I haven't seen any demonstration of Alexander's \"greatness\"!! Talking about conquering Tyre and Egypt?

The story lingered too long on the homosexual side of his life. The fighters were not plausible as they were generally slim boys with makeup and would not have stood up in a battle.

To fully appreciate this, you need to enjoy history, have an open mind, and actually be able to *pay* *attention* to what the 'characters' are saying. Alexander did a *lot,* and Stone is trying to include as much as he can, coherently, to give us the best picture all around of who Alexander really was. And I think that for the most part he did a really good job of acheiving this. I don't care how they marketed the film. I do, however, think that they should have gotten linguistic coaches for their actors in major roles - you cannot have what sounds like a Scottish Crateros, an Irish Alexander, etc. - it takes the viewers out of the movie enough for them to have to tell themselves to ignore that element (and can annoy many people throughout).

Val Kilmer\u00b4s performance nominated for Razzie **** as worst supporting actor? Are you **** kidding me? His talks with young Alexander, especially in the cave were some of the best father talks of heritage and legacy in cinema. The movie is for the most part historically accurate, the battles are epic, the visuals are great, Vangelis soundtrack is transcendental work of art... Boohoo Farrel had an accent, who gives a **** If you call his performance \"bad acting\", you are delusional. He got the essence and legend of Alexander right. Alexander was more than a man, his ambition made him distant a alone, even among his men and Farrel captured that beautifully. His speech to his men to march to India, pleading for one more month, seeing the difference of mindsets between mortals and a man with endless ambition... Anthony Hopkins as old Ptolemy, Christopher Plummer as Aristotle giving lecture to young Alexander and his future generals and friends who would change the course of the world forever... This movie has some of the most epic and impactful scenes in cinematography...

It was somewhat intriging, the relationship between Alexander and his father was interesting and being a huge history fanatic myself I learnt some new things. The battle of Guagamela was also really nice to look at but no where as epic as other battles like Troy, Lord of the Rings etc. After the first hour it really started to drag on but I did watch the whole and I don't think I'll ever watch it again the second time due to its long running time.\rI think the reason why the film was so boring was because there was not much memorable moments that refreshed the experience and I found the character of Alexander's mother difficult to understand.

Everything in this piece of crap is horrible. Choosing a whiney bastard Colin Farrell, Marlon Brando, Hannibal Lector, and Angelina Jolie was a 'Meh,' the story is confusing, overblown action battle scenes, and Stone just lost his balance on why Alexander should've been a great movie to begin with. But I've have just seen enough of Colin Farrell and his offensive Greek accent. Some may think this is a big misunderstanding, but PLEASE do not watch this movie.

Let's face it, if a son moves overseas for the best part of a decade it's a good bet he's not to closely tied/reliant on his mother. The whole thing with snakes and the mother was just crass.Alexander's motive for world domination is passable addressed but the multiple other aspects of his life are largely ignored and though facts are scarce as this happened such a long time ago some risk could have been taken via poetic licence for the reasons he did what he did."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This is hands down one of the best historical epics ever made.

A very exclusive list of personalities who, for good or bad reasons, have forever changed our world's history. Personalities like Jesus Christ, Julius Caesar, Gengis Khan, Albert Einstein, Adolf Hitler, Cleopatra, Shakespeare, Christopher Columbus, Vasco da Gama, Galileo Galilei, Darwin, Napoleon, George Washington or Picasso... heroes or villains in an always subjective list, but it's impossible to think what the world would look like without them, isn't it? So it is with Alexander. But I'm not here to talk about this historical personality, just the movie. An intense epic that seeks to be faithful to the known facts of the life of this conquering, narcissistic, megalomaniac, homosexual and deeply complex king. This story begins at the Battle of Gaugamela (331 BC) and follows, recounting childhood, youth and ascension to the throne through flashbacks.Overall, I found the film interesting and enjoyable, even though it wasn't good. The script is historically accurate, at least in general. Of course there are exaggerated or buzzing scenes for dramatic purposes. The problem is that, even so, its a vague script and doesn't justify three and a half hours lenght. It would have been better if the post-production and editing work had cut about forty-five minutes. Another problem I felt was excessive grandeur. I know it's an epic movie, but it's possible to be epic without being presumptuous and this movie was a show of self-importance. This can be seen in the actors' theatrical and affected manners, a bunch of peacocks displaying their feathers all the time. This heroic spirit impregnated also Vangelis soundtrack, probably one of the worst he already made. I still felt difficulties with all those flashbacks. A narrative so loaded with advances and retreats seems more like a tango. They are useful, no one doubts, but sometimes it took a long time for me to realize that I was watching a flashback, and it makes everything more tiresome and confusing.The film is loaded with great actors but none of them shone for lack of a competent script and director. Colin Farrell was boringly heroic and should have kept his hair dark because the real Alexander would NEVER have been blonde. The way this actor behaved was erratic and dialogues were theatrical and full of pompous sentences. Angelina Jolie is a casting error, she was too young for the character and seemed constantly younger than her own son. Val Kilmer was OK as Phillip, with a generous dose of make-up for making him older and scarred. Anthony Hopkins and Christopher Plummer were both well, but there wasn't much for them here. Jared Leto was terribly bad, and his effeminate character was already boring enough. Rosario Dawson, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, John Kavanagh and other actors were OK as supporting but had no individual brilliance.On a technical level, the film is flawless. CGI is excellent and gives us some truly beautiful scenes, such Babylon or several battle scenes. Battles are spectacular and full of action, steroids, adrenaline and epic spirit. Cinematography is loaded with warm, intense yellow and red colors, and this sometimes tires our eyes a little, but it's beautiful. Costumes are very detailed and well made. Oliver Stone worked hard on these points and succeeded, but it was the bad script, the actors wooden performances, the erratic narrative and an unpleasant presumption that defeated this film."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "This movie sucked.
