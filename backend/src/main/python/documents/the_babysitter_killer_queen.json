      "text": "This film is bad.  But the prequel is excellent fun.  I was shocked how much I liked the first film...Go see it...it's great ! And If you haven't seen it in a while then watch it... instead of this hot trash!Seriously it fails on every level. OMG it's sooo bad. But the sad thing is ...it didn't have to be trash or this bad.  Same actors and writer / director.  The first 30 mins is fine. It tricks you into hoping it may be good.  But once the black stereotypes begin (and never stop) the film is all downhill. So it recreates the exact same film but without the house and so without the tension and creativity.  The writing is infantile and creepy. It's really creepy... and lazy.  With tired cultural references and lame pot drug and poop jokes.  Also they take the one genuinely nice relationship which has real chemistry and...yeah they **** all over that and force a new unrealistic one on us.  It has some bad cgi too and the music from mass effect. You know a film is total trash when you're using your phone to Google the first film while watching the sequel.  Did I mention it's creepy. With older men writing for younger men who hang with younger kids and it shows.  Like your dad wrote you a movie but only because he fancies your best friend on something messed up stuff lol like ...there is a scene with a guy accidentally pissing on a girls face and she's ok with it.  And every girl in the film obsesses on her boobs.  Also the the music is all this stuff from the directors ancient past and out of place as much as the creepy jokes.I hope they don't make a sequel.  The only reason they made this garbage was becasue the director was given more money after the first one was a hit and he made this absolutely trash 80s kids spin off which flopped horribly.This film is undeserving of the babysitter title.  Avoid like the plague."

I wasn't a fan of the first one, but I wanted to see what kind of nonsense they could cook up this time.I mean, I would watch anything for my main man, McG.The sequel is no better from the last, but I won't lie, I found some enjoyment from it. Not a good movie by any means, but a guilty pleasure for me. However, it needed more Samara Weaving as she isn\u2019t in the movie that much."

The chicks are still dressed like sluts, and the kid that could have been The Rainmaker is a weak intellectual until demons show up, and they show up in a stupidly contrived manner. But it's still entertaining to watch this comedic teen adventure, even if it is much weaker than its predecessor. I give it a 5/10."

I really do hope they do a third one because of how the second one ended because the director McG already has plans for the third movie, so lets hope he does a third movie.This movie is better than the first one. In this movie is has a lot of \"oh my God I can't believe that just happened\". Also has many gory scenes in, and also has a big twist at the end of the movie but I'll let you find it out of what that twist is. So if your a fan of the first movie then you will most likely enjoy the sequel."

      "text": "The Babysitter Killer Queen: This is a spoiler filled review so just a heads up if you want to watch this skip the review watch it and come back and we can all COMPLAIN ABOUT HOW ASS THIS MOVIE WAS. Alright so I\u2019m getting to the point here why was Samara Weaving retconned into a good guy when in the first movie she was the main antagonist. For real she comes up at the end of the movie to save Cole and his new girlfriend, yeah Jena Ortega is in this movie and not to mention the movie actually says they had sex, sure I\u2019m not going to pretend I\u2019m a saint but earlier in the movie you hear the Cole is a freshman in high school. But I do like the chemistry between Cole and Phoebe have together but I hate the love story thing in this. The first movie had Cole being a hero and stuff and he kisses Melanie near the end but it wasn\u2019t a love story. Speaking of her come on, she is now the main antagonist of this which I find lazy and stupid because she was the whole reason Cole finally grew a pair and \u201ckilled\u201d Bee at the end, but now she looks more like Samara Weaving then anything. But the characters besides the School Nurse, Cole, his parents, Melanie\u2019s dad and Phoebe just **** suck. We got Andrew Bachelor back aka King Bach and he is more annoying then anything, he twerks in the movie, that\u2019s comedy, Bella Thorne is back complaining she shouldn\u2019t do anything because she\u2019s hot, I do have to give probs Robbie Amell who plays Max the guy who always has his shirt off he does a good job. We get useless backstories to how they were recruited and it\u2019s just a slog. But the best thing is the kills OH MY GOD, as soon as the first girl gets her throat slit it goes more wild then ever, some of the blood is CGI but most of it looks practical from what I can tell. Overall this is a useless sequel just around to give us more kills if you want to watch a Babysitter movie watch the first. McG has to be someone that can make a good movie and then **** the bed. Ranking Toilet Paper."

I love films that finish properly! The pace is blistering, the acting memorable and epic, the characters (even the evil ones) charismatic and engaging. The film looks highly processed and digital giving it an unreal feel, this is not necessarily a bad thing just worth being aware of. This oozes style, comedy, action and excitement. Well worth watching, just make sure you watch The Babysitter (20117) first."
