On the contrast, all male characters act like incompetent idiots and talks like scum. Because, you know, every soldier in WW II was a masogynist. Don't waste your time on this trash. This movie is not one of those \"so bad that it's good\", it's just bad. Really bad."

I rarely wanted 1,5 hrs of my life back as much as after watching this.. It's basically an hour and a half of sticking to men while they just stand on the sidewalk with open mouth. I thought first that the music might be fitting, but more than 1 point in the film it was more distracting than fitting. After the mystical element was introduced with the gremlin, I expected the package to be somewhat connected to that. The movie would have been better if it would focus more on the mystical line. I don't mind the female lead at all but the fact that she saved literally everyone multiple times while all men were just babbling idiots on the side-lines there only to be hindering, berating, and eventually graveling on their knees in front of the main lead made this movie painful to watch. Characters were uninteresting to watch other than the main lead, I guess my main problem with this movie is that other than the main lead, the rest of the cast was forgettable, interchangeable, they had no story or focus, almost like the whole plane and mission could have been completed by the main lead alone. I expected significantly more from this move, but ultimately, it did not worth my time, it's not something I'd recommend to anybody for any reason other than torture."

Then at the end to presumably dedicate the movie to all the prior female military pilots...she didn't even fly the plane!

      "text": "I have no idea what I just watched, but I do know it was intended to be blatant and deceiving woke propaganda.The beginning of the movie is kinda ok. Even the supernatural stuff. It is very unrealistic from the start (like a B17 landing right over her head and then she doesnt move and suddenly she stands right under another stopped B17, or no oxygen needed on a Pacific flight - yet they do have filled oxygen tanks that play a role later, or the temperature on board in that altitude). But it keeps you interested for a good while.The issue isnt really the female protagonist or a completely incompetent \"diversity\" token co-pilot (you do know what youre doing with such a depiction, director, do you?), its that the movie suddenly takes a hard woke/crazy/ridiculousness turn in the middle, that just makes you feel like you have just been conned by the director and writer (interestingly woke directors use that tactic a lot in movies and series - I wonder why... no I dont). Even the music turns to absolute garbage all of the sudden (not that it was fitting for the times depicted in the first place).Turns out the whole movie was just about giving it to men and pointing out that women served in WW2 and can scream very loud for no reason (I thought thats an old stereotype they wanted to get rid of?) and can develop literal super powers and freeze enemies in fear so that they let themselves get killed without any defense.To the director and writer: If you wanted to show the female heroes of WW2, then you should have made a documentary about them. Those were real heroes and a vital part in the effort to win WW2 (even, or especially in Russia). With crap like this you make fun of them. Not only that, you demean the male heroes of WW2 and divide present societies, paving the way for new conflicts and ultimately wars.Disgusting."

This movie could have been an awesome survial/horror or a War/Drama but rather they made it a B grade pointless joke.

It somehow manages to get much worse as you progress, ending on the low-note of a baby crying and a mother breast feeding as actual \"scenes\".  I think this film is aimed at the sort of people who find Jacinda Ardern inspiring (for example) and potentially single mothers with 5+ illegitimate children to different fathers.  They potentially could make more sense of this train wreck of a film.  Any sane person should distance themselves from this mess at all costs."

Part creature feature, part WW2 fighter pilot movie, all pulp and mystery. The first half of the movie is a claustrophobic mystery, as the story begins to unfold and twists are laid out. The second half is a pulse-pounding, over-the-top action movie. The final third was just the cherry on top, with an ending that for me, elevated it to something a bit more than your typical pulp. It's so hard not to spoil it, but it's very apparent it was written and directed by a woman in the best way possible and I even felt empowered. I'm going to definitely be buying this when it comes out on Blu-Ray, but I wouldn't rent it for the $20 bucks. One thing I love about this movie, even though it's pulp, it takes itself seriously and actually works on being a good movie and not just trying to be so bad it's good. Reminded me a bit of Overlord, though that movie was a bit better. Chloe Grace Moretz was so awesome in this one, I'm hoping this won't be the last adventure she takes this character on. This film was originally going to be written and directed by Max Landis, he has a writing credit, but his script was very short and changed drastically to what we got on screen.  Good riddance to him, I'm glad we got some new talent on the screen."

The film has a ton of atmosphere and is really quite good, until it jumps the shark with a questionable back story that set everything into motion.

What started out as good and well paced dialogue became every character being very ham fisted with shoving current gender roll politics into every shot. The lines of dialogue at the climax and resolution of the movie made the person watching this with me say \u201cthis is why you need a studio to step in when your good ideas become a lame student film project with a budget.\u201d If you like roller coaster rides and can easily suspend your disbelief then this could be something you\u2019d get a kick out of.

Frankly, I was hoping for something different, but basically, Shadow in the Cloud, ends up being a mixture of attractive ideas, but unluckily doesn't manage to land any of them gracefully.Much of its short duration deals with Chloe Grace Moretz locked up in a small cabin listening to her male companions making sexist jokes about her, to of course give a social message about feminism, while at the same time, with her in there, we have a small subplot that copies Nightmare at 20,000 Feet from The Twilight Zone, to then become an action film in its last 25 minutes.Like I said, it's a strange mix, but hardly outstanding or rewarding.I liked the soundtrack though."
