The twist ending is a great homage to horror films in general, and the thrills are non-stop. Plus one for the fact that Sarah Michelle Gellar's in it."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Acting: The acting is much like it is in the first one. it isn't Oscar winning but the main actors, and even the supporting characters, do a great job and that helps keep the movie more interesting and fun to watch. The actors really made the characters more likable. I like the characters of this film (Ghostface is my favorite. To me, he is a whole different character than the character under the mask and I like that a lot).Plot: The plot is more or less the same as the first one. Killer stalking people and ripping them apart. Standard stuff. the only real differences are the setting and the fact that the survivors are dealing with the events of the first one.Screenplay: not perfect. It was weak in some spots, but there was some good stuff. Like the rules of this one. I applaud the genius who thought of the idea to have the rules of slasher films for this film.Likeableness: This film, like the first one, is incredibly likable. you just have to love it when you are watching it. There are many reasons for that. One of them is that the killer is human. he trips, he falls, he gets the crap beaten out of him. Long story short, he earns his kills. just like in the first one. a superhuman killer is boring. It is an extremely fun film to watch. good characters, great killer, it's just a blast.Final Score: 8.85/10.0 (N)TRIVIA TIME: 1. Not only was the cast not informed who the killer was until the last Day of shooting, they also didn't receive the last 10 pages of the script until it was time to film them. The last 10 pages were also printed on grey paper, therefore making them unable to be illicitly Xeroxed. All cast members had to sign contracts that they would not discuss the movie's outcome or the killer's identity with the media.2. Though in most films, phone voices are recorded later, director Wes Craven actually had the voice of the killer on set, to heighten the sense of fear for the actors. According to Roger Jackson, who plays the voice, he was kept on set but always out of sight from the actors, so they couldn't picture a face with the voice. He said while watching the monitors, he could see between takes that Heather Graham looked a little scared, whereas Sarah Michelle Gellar would pick up the phone and carry on a conversation with him.3. The tagline for \"Stab\" (the movie within the movie) is, \"This is Gonna Hurt\".4. The rules for a horror movie sequel - as laid out by Randy in the film - are (1) the body count is always bigger and (2) the death scenes are always much more elaborate with more blood and gore. The third rule to surviving a sequel is cut from the movie, but is shown in the trailer. \"\"And #3. Never, ever under any circumstance assume that the killer is dead.\"5. Any actor auditioning for the part of Derek had to perform the scene in the cafeteria where he sings \"I Think I Love You\" without accompaniment."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "It has been a year since the events at Woodsboro.

The increased blood and gore were controversial when released but has fared well over the years."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "The artistic medium of film is very subjective. Every audience member has a different set of criteria they use to measure their viewing experience. Not everyone shares the same set of criteria. If we did, what a bland and uninspired world this would be.\r What I Personally Liked About \"Scream 2\":\rRight off the bat, let me say that the two best things about this sequel are Neve Campbell and Jamie Kennedy. They bring the same energy and same characterizations to this second installment that they brought to the first. It seems like they slipped effortlessly back into their roles whereas Courteney Cox and David Arquette struggled here and there. The death of Kennedy's character Randy was one of the best sequences of the movie and was a necessary evil as the ante always needs to be upped in sequels. Personally, I just think it's a shame Dewey didn't die while they were at it. Liev Schreiber was also a wonderful supporting actor who fits the film well. If they could have only found a few more people like him who didn't automatically turn into overacting hyenas, we would have been all set. While we're at it, Peter Deming's magnificent cinematography should be noted as one of the highlights of this production. Visual framing this good really deserves a better movie to accompany its presence.\r What I Personally Disliked About \"Scream 2\":\rFor the most part, this sequel takes itself more seriously than its predecessor did and this hampers the enjoyment tremendously. Where the first film lampooned the horror genre, this second chapter feels like it's striving to fit in with the very flicks the initial production thumbed its nose at. In addition, it succumbs to the pitfall that plagues most scary movie sequels: it feels like we've seen it all before. It has nothing new to bring to the table. A good example of this is the boyfriend issue. For those of you (like myself) who thought Skeet Ulrich was the height of conventionality, I give you Jerry O'Connell. Yikes. He just had to sing, too, didn't he? Oh, the horror! I'm also not a big fan of Courteney's hair. Seriously. Who in their right mind thought THAT looked good? Double yikes. The inclusion of the painfully unfunny sorority girl stereotypes was also an abysmal decision which, of course, would make triple yikes. I thought watching Arquette in the first film was like being slammed against a brick wall but these girls take the cake. At least David had the good sense to ever so slightly tone down his buffoonish antics. Let's be completely honest with each other as well, shall we? The twist ending in this picture is a little lame and quite a bit forced when compared next to the innovation of the original.\r My Overall Impression of \"Scream 2\":\rAt two hours in length, this film is about forty minutes too long. A lot of sequences (particularly the atrocious last third of the movie) seem to drag out endlessly and the viewer is left to wonder what happened to Wes Craven's normally tight directing skills. There are some briefly enjoyable moments scattered about, but this sequel feels more tired than inspired."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "A lot weaker than the first because a lot of times the whole plot seems silly, but the movie still is quite scary, with its odd but cool beginning.

The coolest character in both the movies gets killed off, and not even in an elaborate kill. Come on!

This sequel is definetly on the \"bad sequels\" list."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "A step back from the original, Scream 2 is a solid sequel that maintains the same level of thrills and mystery of the original, but much of the experience feels entirely hollow. With Sidney (Neve Campbell) now at college, a copycat killer has decided to follow her and finish what the original ghostface had started. An expertly crafted analysis of horrible horror sequels, the influence of film in real world violence, and horror movies as a whole, Scream 2 is a good satire, even if it is not nearly as scary or funny as the original.\r Back for their second rodeo, Sidney is joined by familiar faces Randy (Jamie Kennedy), Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox), and Dewey (David Arquette). The band is back together, yet they do not seem to have much of the same energy or power as in the original. For example, the smaller role played here by Randy is unfortunate, as he was the source of a lot of the fun of the original. While everyone was scared speechless, Randy kept things going with horror movie references or playing whodunnit with the cops. There is a little bit of that here, but after a while, the film opts to ditch the whole mystery solving element that made the original work so well and instead just focus on scaring you.\r On the scariness front, there are some solid moments. Director Wes Craven knows horror and he is not afraid to display this skill-set in Scream 2. A sequence in which Gale tries to escape Ghostface with Dewey is incredibly tense and terrifically shot. From beginning to end, this scene is laced with tension and really highlights just how scary the Scream franchise can be in its own right. However, as we reach the climax, though it is surprising who the killers are, they just feel like reaches. The twists just feel tacked on to try and make references to the original and, as a result, feel entirely like fan service. Ironically, a killer promises they are not like every other 90s killer only to then take 15 hours to finally try and kill their intended victim. Though Scream 2 is willing to call out conventions, I guess they decided to forget that one was a convention as well.\r Additionally, the red herrings here are quite obvious and never quite work. Much of the cast is thrown under suspicion, but whenever somebody asks, \"What if you're the killer?\", you can feel the air escape from the movie a bit when you realize that there is no way they could be the killer. Instead of building mystery and suspense, the film immediately tries to assist the audience in jumping to conclusions about who the killers are and then tries to play on those red herrings at the end. Yet, the audience, hopefully, has realized they are not be believed which makes some of the end reveals completely unsurprising.\r This said, Scream 2 most certainly entertains and though a step back from the original, a lot of the playful spirit of the film is there as Craven toys with and mocks horror cliches. The end results are some pretty comical moments that really land. This ferocious blend of horror and comedy does prove incredibly entertaining and this is what makes Scream 2 so incredibly watchable. Even when the mystery elements flounder and fail to deliver the same suspense as before, the film does have some surprises along the way that do land quite well.\r Scream 2 is an entertaining film, but just feels like a hollow exercise of re-doing what made the original good. It retains the majority of the terror and the comedy, but the mystery of the original is gone as is the manic fun that made it such a good satire of the genre. Here, things are a bit gloomier and, as a result, not nearly as good."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "A good sequel, doesn't quite reach the heights of the first one.

Speaking of performances everything is upped a notch. Neve Campbell is electrifying as Sidney giving her a u pique strength and relatable vulnerability. Courtney Cox really has a journey in this film as Gale and David Arquette is again wonderfully and layered as Dewey. As for the newbies Timothy Olyphant, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Laurie Metcalf and Liev Schreiber offer solid support. This entry has a bit more to say about the mechanics of the genre and is even a bit more involved than it's predecessor but the sheer magnetism of the first is never fully met. As it stands it's still one hell of an amazing movie.Budget: $24mDomestic Box Office: $101mWorldwide Box Office: $172m4.5/5"}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Interesting sequel to the major first opus. The two films are cleverly intertwined as we can easily recognize the characters and their intentions.Characters are quite likeable (or hateful) but many of them evolve during the several events. Some of them sadly are one-dimensional, as Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox), because even her sudden development seems false and shallow. She doesn't deserve such a happy-ending. The most important protagonists showcase very impressive reflexes and speed while the rest of the cast often die in a ridiculous way. If the two first kills happen fast, it is hard to know why them especially. In the same way, protagonists quite often make bad choices. Like very dumb ones. It feels like 'Scream 2' has multiplied its characters only to make us doubt between many people when searching for culprit.The pressure is great and goes crescendo, the slaughters feels more agressive and violent, more realistic and less gore. The police(men) are nothing but ineffective. Environments are varied which allows differents angles and kill scenes, bringing a bit of fresh air. The end is particularly intense but unfortunately once again uses the 'psycho' formula ending, just as the first opus.'Scream 2' manages to be incredibly sarcastic and he shows a poignant self-mockery, but to go where? It seems that it only offers what it already has.Yeah, 'Scream 2' manages to be scary from time to time but fails to provide a solid and original scenario, even if it uses many plots based on the first film."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "A sequel that is done right.
