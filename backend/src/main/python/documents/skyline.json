I have to give the intriguing trailer a big round of applause. If you have seen the trailer before, I can guarantee you will be so bloody curious to watch the movie itself (exactly what happened to CLASH OF THE TITANS earlier thiz year). They were editing the trailer so well. But the fact is: Something so wrong is going on. Next Thing I can say, A-Class Special Effects collide with C-Class Actors. The movie directed by Special Effects experts, Colin and Greg Strause, who also directed AVPR: ALIENS VS. PREDATOR-REQUIEM: (2007). The premise is mysterious at the beginning, one night at 4:27 A.M. strange blue beams appear on the City of Los Angeles. It is the first initial of the extraterrestrial invasion. The storyline only follows one point of view (just like CLOVERFIELD, 2008), the movie focuses on a group of certain people and what happens next to them. They are Eric Balfour, Scottie Thompson, Donald Faison, David Zayas and others. There is a scene that I think it is a rip-off from WAR OF THE WORLDS (2005), when Terry meets a stranger and the alien is sneaking around to hunt them furtively with its long and creepy tentacles. The last thing I can say, The Sky is wreck and The Line is flat. Approaching the end of the movie, the story-telling is getting more and more poignantly absurd. For example (Spoiler Alert!), the octopus look-alike alien which could chase and destroy jet aircraft and even sophisticated Stealth fighter jet, can be defeated by bare-hand and an axe. Strause brothers are really getting on my nerves, while they underestimate our intelligence with their absurd story. There are several of them. However there is something that maybe you wont realize. Everyone and most critics thought that thiz movie was a monstrous failure, but what you did not realize that thiz movie made with budget of ONLY $10 million (estimated). To be certain, they made up some real money here. The tagline on thiz movie is: Do not look up, well, do not even look at the film itself. Next time if aliens invade the theaters like thiz again, I would rather go home and sleep on my bed.

The DVD container emphasizes in large font that the visual effects are from the same guys who worked on Avatar, Iron Man 2, and 300!  What the container does not say is that the screenwriters from those films did not work on Skyline.  Aliens descend from the sky and everything which occurs afterwards, the audience sees from the perspective of a particular group of people trapped in a Los Angeles penthouse.  Why this group?  Aliens are everywhere and we have to see the events through the eyes of people we cannot stand?  The characters are one-dimensional and very obnoxious for most of the time.  Why did they waste what must have been an enormous visual effects budget on a story which appears to still be in draft form?  Did the producers feel the story in Avatar or District 9 was too complicated?  Stay away from this movie!\r P.S.  The Air Force goes up against the aliens at points and I hope they were using some top secret drones; otherwise, those were B-2s pulling 9 G's and outmaneuvering enemy fighters.  Also, an F-22 crashes and 'bounces' right over the main characters.  *smacks forehead*"}, {"rating": "4", "text": "The movie had potential.  I liked how they attempted to portray events from purely the characters perspective.  I agree there were a lot of random scenes that were quite pointless to what little story there was.  The attempts at character background were somewhat shoddy, but not altogether terrible.  The CGI depicted the action and certainly drew you into the show.  I think how the characters responded to the crisis and invasion was not portrayed realistically.  I know I would have been going door to door in all the apartments looking for weapons or something useful to defend myself.  They just stayed in that one apartment the WHOLE time.  I would have ventured out at night to try and escape to the sea or at least tried to improve my situation as much as I could.  The fact that the aliens were practically impervious to all of the attempts to destroy them quite frankly was retarded.  It certainly promoted a somber depressing theme and frustrated me.  I would've liked to have seen the few uprisings and military attacks to have made some sort of impact on the aliens.  On that note I found it surprising that these aliens with all their technology were thwarted by shades or a simple kitchen counter in their attempts to locate humans.  I mean come on, if you can rebuild an entire spacecraft in a few hours after being nuked, but you can see past some shades?  What was the point for these aliens to invade anyway?  They needed brains to run their biomechanical creations?  That's pretty lame.  That's about 7 billion brains....I think those ships would have to be a little bigger and that it would take a lot longer to clean out L.A. then a few days.  I guess the brains, for the most part, lost their individuality and independence once they were transferred to their new hosts/bodies in a sort of \"borg\" like fashion.  That does not help this already handicapped movie in anyway. I think we all like movies to have some sort of closure, and that attempts to end movies without ending them only frustrate viewers and demonstrates a lack of creativity or ability to put together a cohesive story.  These \"endings\" make me think that the writers/producers could only come up with a bunch of noncontiguous scenes that they thought would be really \"cool\" to create, but then when they've created them they don't know how to connect them. That is my very long rant on a not so terrible B movie that had its moments in bringing me into the movie, but for the most part left me high and dry in terms realistic portrayal, lack of cohesive story, and fundamentally flawed ending on all points.  But hey the nuking of that alien mothership was pretty sweet.   I just need to remember not to lock myself in an apartment next time there is an alien invasion."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Some of the worst acting ive ever seen Jared \"JRock\" is the biggest tool alive.

Characters have little to do with what's going on around them and stand around like props waiting to be struck from the set by CGI tentacles.  I found myself vaguely interested by the invasion strategy: using light to lure victims into arms reach, but eventually decided it was a little redundant since the aliens are perfectly capable of getting to you and there's not much of a human defense against them.  My next bug-a-boo in movies of this genre is a poorly crafted rationale for the protagonist's ability to fight back.  I'm lead to assume Jarrod (Eric Balfour) is so somehow special by sheer virtue of his good looks and...neat tattoos because he got super-powers instead of being brainwashed by the alien lure AND was able to transfer his consciousness into one of the alien husks after being 'harvested.'

Adding to the bad side of the movie came the dialogue. Laughable yet not funny at all, first time writer Joshua Cordes did an amazing job of trying to earn himself a Razzie award for Worst Screenplay. I can't say anything about the cast because apocalypse movies' cast is always the unknowns and are usually bad. But given all the negatives, I think the visual and CGI effects are a bit wonderful.

It's difficult to get an alien apocalypse movie wrong honestly, you just need some cool aliens, combat scenes and explosions, plus a little bit of drama wouldn't go amiss either.

The actors are universally poor, as is the sorry excuse for a script. The entire first 30 minutes of the movie are completely redundant and each character might as well be a cardboard cutout with one defining characteristic each. It is impossible to feel anything for these people when the acting is two dimensional and the script doesn't deliver a single line of good dialogue the entire time. The characters don't go anywhere, which is appropriate considering the movie doesn't either.

It's not Ontario, that's for sure. Concerning these places, the refrain \"I wanna go\" becomes a sentiment that moviegoers can relate with. \"Skyline\" is not Bruce McDonald's \"Pontypool\", the great 2009 Canadian indie whose action, brain-eating action, was also confined to one set. That zombie film had characters, especially Grant Mazzy, the disc jockey played by Stephen McHattie. \"Skyline\" has zombies all right, but they're not the aliens with an appetite for grey matter; they're the actors, all of whom deliver performances that rival porno ones. We root for these boring people to escape the confinements of Terry's high-rise apartment, because the cabin fever is mutual. We stare longingly at the theater exits. We could have stayed home and watched this sort of bargain basement sci-fi on basic cable. \"Skyline\" is not a wide release-caliber film. Jamal(Eric Balfour), new to L.A., along with his girlfriend Elaine(Scottie Thompson), starts the ball rolling when he proposes the idea of going to a relatively cool place: the marina, where the boats are, where he believes the aliens aren't. The aliens hate water, he theorizes, so they mobilize: five people, two cars, but before \"Skyline\" has a chance to get into gear, the car of adulterers(Terry and Denise, played by Donald Faizon and Crystal Reed) is demolished by an alien, just as it emerges from the parking garage. No road trip; no cool places, even relatively cool ones like the marina, because \"Skyline\" doesn't have the budget for a full-fledged escape from Los Angeles. Whereas \"Pontypool\" evoked the 1938 radio broadcast of H.G. Wells' \"War of the Worlds\" by insinuating the action via audio, \"Skyline\" projects its invasion on a flat-screen television, as a result of the link-up between the telescope and the monitor. Both films re-imagine a scenario in which the Mercury Theater's rendering of the alien invasion, narrated by Orson Welles, was real. Appropriately enough, \"Pontypool\" had a captivating voice to convey the attack, while \"Skyline\" lets the action speak for itself, fodder for the screen, as the US military's fight with the enemy gets translated into visuals, turning the speaking-challenged actors into an auxiliary audience. Ultimately, Jamal does end up in a cool place(climate-wise), the alien spacecraft, along with his pregnant girlfriend, once these discriminating extra-terrestrials get their fill of brains, metropolitan brains(L.A. and New York) exclusively, according to the time-log: no Bible Belt brains, no Dustbowl brains, no Appalachian Mountain brains are not good eatin' by these otherworldly creatures' lofty standards. \"Skyline\" ends with a \"minimum of chit-chat\", as Jamal, whose consciousness now survives in an alien body, makes human contact with Elaine through touch, like some dystopian version of \"E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial\".
