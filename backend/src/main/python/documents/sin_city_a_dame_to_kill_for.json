Either the people leaving bad reviews have not actually seen the movie, or they are not fans of Robert Rodriguez or comic books in general.  This is the ONLY movie series out that is made to look and feel exactly like you are reading a comic.   Everything about the movie has the comic book feel.  The acting is spot on, the visual & special effects were beautiful to the eye.  I could not look away.  I have been waiting almost 10 years for this movie and I was not disappointed.  If you are not a Robert Rodriguez fan and don't like comic books,  this movie is not for you.  For me,  I would see it again and again.  Now the wait begins for the Blu Ray Steelbook Collector's Edition.  I can't wait!!"

The color palette and look of the film is pristine.  The bad:  Dialogue seems hackneyed and cheesy this time around.  The voice over is well over used and doesn't have the impact of the original.  The Ugly:  The Nancy Callahan story at the end is just laughably bad.  It s almost seems like self parody at times.  MIller and Rodiguez seemed to get lazy including Marv as a hitman in each of the three stories.  The movie just loses its punch by the end.  There are also a ton of idiotic scenes where characters say things like \"Hold still so I can blow your brains out.\"  and then proceed to shoot them in the shoulder.  Or a hangman's noose just appears out of nowhere."

This one lost a lot of the heart and believability of the characters. It's a very surface-level schlock shock movie. Maybe Rodriguez and Miller did it for the paycheck. It focuses on cheap endless attention-grabbing thrills, and regurgitates many of the same kinds of visuals and scenes that made the first movie stand out... but gets old fast. I suppose audiences when this came out were easy to please. I found it painfully mind-numbing, and besides a few good performances form a few actors, worth tossing in the bin. Hopefully I'll forget about it soon."

      "text": "Sin City: A Dame To Kill For is a bone crunching, sexy and stylized trip back to basics. The audience who watched Sin City (including me) are introduced to some new characters. Such as Johnny played by Joseph Gordon Levitt, a boy with luck while playing cards. Jamie King was very surprising as Wendy, they didn't talk much about her in the previous film. Well, Dame To Kill For starts up with Dwight played by Josh Brolin (first it was Clive Owen), he now has a changed up face using a surgery. Dwight now looks for revenge from the evil and sexy Ava played by Eva Green. The film had a Interesting path with the Nancy Hartigan story, but they didn't use Bruce Willis as much. He was just there for 3 minutes as a dream in Nancy's mind! Mickey Rourke plays Marv, a demented killer who helps Dwight in his goal. Overall, A Dame To Kill For is a badass movie. It has a great art style, pumping action but some of it slows down and drags you toward the climax. But it's a great watch, that doesn't top the original, but is really fun to watch. Even If you are not the comic's fan."

I have read all 8 volumes of Sin City and this was like opening up a whole new book because about 60% of the movie is new material. The only adapted storyline is \"A Dame to Kill For\" and it followed its source material swimmingly. This has a master class if actors, the standouts are JGL, Eva Green, Mickey Rourke and Powers Booth. Jessica Alba is at her best which is still only okay. Josh Brolin kicks ass as per usual. People complain about the continuity and that this movie is to over the top and gratuitous in every fashion but the fact is is that this is a comic book movie that embraces what it is and takes its Neo-Noir storytelling all the way. Its fun,  its bloody, its sexy and its soooooo bad-ass. If liked the comics and the first film you'll love this.\r Also The Hateful Eight teaser was beautiful.\r Score: 10 out of 10\rDimension Films, 102 min. Rated R"

      "text": "Unlike the original Sin City, which I did enjoy, Dame To Kill For fails to interweave the various story lines into a coherent plot.  The film tries to build a moody, gritty, noir feel, at the expense of building any sensibility into the characters or sympathy for their various plights.   The justifications for the action sequences are ham fisted into place, and the visuals are at times laughably out of place, rather than stylistically atmospheric. Dramatic moments were made laughable by the lack of subtly, light hearted moments passed virtually unnoticed.   By far the worst movie I\u2019ve seen in some time, first movie I ever considered walking out of, I wish I had."

The film is ultra violent (Pleasingly so) and stylish however, it is not nearly as fresh and exciting as it was nine years ago. The actors do what they can and notable stand outs include Eva Green, Mickey Rourke, Joseph Gordon Levitt, and Josh Brolin as the recast Dwight. It is a good time spent at the movies and it does not run too long at 102 minutes. This film is not going to revolutionize film making, but if you like the characters from the original and are interested in what came before or after the events of the first film you won't regret giving this movie a shot this weekend."

      "text": "This movie has been my most anticipated film for a very long time, I am a huge fan of the 2005 original for being so unique and the art direction took by Rodriguez and Miller. I admire Rodriguez for making the films shot for shot identical to their corresponding stories from the comic book series. The fact that Josh Brolin and Joseph Gordon Levitt starring in the sequel just made it even sweeter. It must be said as well that Mickey Rourke IS a badass as Marv once again and Eva Green gives a stunning performance as the manipulative femme fatale Ava Lorde. The story is made up of four stories. Two from the comic books and two original stories written for the film by Frank Miller. I found them all very enjoyable and the opening story, Just Another Saturday Night brilliantly set the tone for the film; very gritty storytelling and violence with a touch of humour from time to time. The majority of the cast give flawless performances ranging from Joseph Gordon Levitt's cocky gambler character to Josh Brolin's Dwight struggling with his past. Jessica Alba is the only weak link as expected but still gives a respectable performance as Nancy Callaghan. I only wish that Michael Clarke Duncan could have returned as Manute if he were still with us but Dennis Haysbert more than makes up for his absense and Jaime Chung is a sufficient replacement for Devon Aoki, and of course Clive Owen is absent as well due to the story taking place before Dwight has his face changed.\r In closing, A Dame to Kill For may not be for everyone because of it's over the top violence and style of storytelling but a large amount of people should find the movie enjoyable including the fans of the original. Please go see this so that there may be a possibility of a third in the future even if it takes another nine years."

Other then that if your a fan of the first Sin City, prepare to be very very disappointed and be out of $7 bucks and 2 hours of your LIFE!!! Because it's that KIND OF BAD and not the BAD in a GOOD WAY!!!\r Oh where to begin??? First off, I don't think Frank Miller really had a concept for this sequel, other then having him self inserted into mult - roles throughout this movie like he's Stan Lee clones of clones in a Marvel Movie about the Clones of Stan Lee cameo roles!!!\r As, CONTINUITY must be a word not used by Frank Miller or not familiar with i e, such as actors not reprising their same roles from the original Devon Aoki as Miho, Clive Owen as Dwight and I can not count Michael Clarke Duncan (May he R.I.P) as Manute but his character did get killed during the final shootout in \"Old Town\" in the first Sin City because they couldn't leave any survivors??? Right??? But leave it to that All State Guy to stay the day! NOT!!!\r And that's the thing about this movie, on one hand it wants to be a continuation from the first Sin City but also at the time not be!!! Such by adding non related material to the movie; Joseph Gordon-Levitt character \"Johnny\" who whole story arc had literally nothing to do with nothing with the movie but at the same time let's show Nancy Callahan going thru a deep state of depression over the death of Hartigan but then at the same time with no separation of the storyline throw in the back story of Dwight getting his face change episode!!!\r And I did I mention Jaime King plays both Goldie / Wendy on screen at the same time, knowing that Goldie was killed in the beginning of the first Sin City!!! WTF!!?!??! I mean, if your going to use character cameos from the first Sin City, then why not used Alexis Bledel as Becky, Benicio Del Toro as Jackie Boy or how about bringing back Josh Hartnett as The Man to explain his story arc to how he knew Becky in the final elevator scene then Johnny!!!\r No No No, must have said Frank Miller to that idea because that would have taken too much time being that it's been 10 years between movies to make this PIECE OF **** SIN CITY 2!!!!\r And for this Frank Miller, I say to YOU: STOP MAKING SEQUELS TO MOVIES THAT DO NOT NEED ONE!!! STOP RUINING MY MEMORIES OF SOME OF FAVORITE MOVIES THAT I HAVE COME TO LOVE IN SIN CITY AND 300!!! YOU NEED TO STOP DOING THIS TO YOUR REMAINING FANS!!! WAS NOT THE SPIRIT ENOUGH DAMAGE TO YOUR BRAND NAME???\r End of Line"

The REAL reality is that A Dame To Kill For is just as air-headed as it's predecessor and about as much fun.\r No, I don't think it's as good as the first film; the stories don't have quite the same narrative force or cohesion and the novelty value of Sin City's hyper-real storytelling is now absent, so we all know what to expect. Consequently the film doesn't really surprise in any way, the dialogue doesn't crackle quite as nicely this time round either, but the truth is that it delivers nice-looking and brainless entertainment and does it efficiently.

And it's the best use of 3D I've ever seen. Truly. And I've seen a LOT of 3D movies. Watching smoke wrap through the air around Eva Green's body, or cards sail across a table into the audience, or Mickey Rourke smashing through a fence on a motorcycle, laughing like a maniac -- every frame is gorgeous.

After the novelty of a slash of bright red across the lips of a black and while character wears off there was a little interest in the name of the actresses playing the female roles as most of the men are more \u2018seasoned\u2019 veterans, and recognizable, though even here one or two have face but not name recognition.\r Anyone familiar with the old movies, or books, like those featuring Mickey Spillane\u2019s Mike Hammer or Dashiell Hammett\u2019s Sam Spade or casts with Humphrey Bogart, Ida Lupino, Barbara Stanwyck, Lana Turner, Veronica Lake, Victor Mature, etc. will find their counterparts in Sin City 2. Every man is hard boiled and every woman a femme fatale. The main difference between this film and the old films are the amount of violence perpetrated not only by the men but more so by the women.\r Written and directed by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller I would love to know which one has the eyeball fetish! The production design by Steve Joyner and Caylah Eddleblute is outstanding as are all the other production assets such as costumes, hair and make up.\r With a cast including Eva Green, Jessica Alba, Bruce Willis, Powers Booth, Mickey Rourke (almost unrecognizable ), Josh Brolin, Rosario Dawson, Stacy Keach, Jaime King, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ray Liotta, just to name a few, plus a cameo by Lady Gaga, keeping track of who is who and trying to remember their real names will keep your mind off of the screenplay that is not at all original in any aspect of film making.\r There is almost as much nudity, frontal and rear, by both males and females, though there is a sense modestly, as there is violence. Killings are by guns, arrows, knives, hands, feet, cars, etc., all graphic and far from modest.\r The best/only way to see this movie is with a free ticket, a free popcorn and a free soda."

It loses some of the surprises and freshness the first had because you know what to expect from the tone and content this time, but the stories keep things great. It's dark world and beautiful visuals that look like they were pulled straight out of a comic book means that fans won't be disappointed.\r Josh Brolin does a great job as Dwight before the face-change surgery. Doesn't do quite as good as Clive Owen did, and he makes the character feel different than before, but still great. However it might be hard to notice as he gets overshadowed by the fantastic Eva Green. She nails her character bringing all the sex appeal and manipulative qualities required. Surprisingly I do feel she's naked too much. There are scenes where it makes sense for her to be naked, and she's got a great body so I'm not complaining about the view, but often more than a few of the nude scenes feel thrown in for fan-service. She's still great though.\r I'm amazed to say there's actually someone who steals the show from Green for once, and that's Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He's excellent as always and his plot was my favorite in the movie. If someone could and was going to steal the show from Green it would've been him, and he does despite her bare TNA and excellent performance. It's also great to see Mickey Rourke back as Marv even if his character just ends up playing sidekick to the others when they need some skulls busted. It still leads to some excellent violence though.\r Getting to see Alba's \"Nancy\" more involved in the action is also a surprising treat, although her plot does throw a few kinks in the timeline. I guess her facial scars just healed before Marv's plot in the first movie, which her plot in this one takes place before of. Still fun though.\r All around it's just another awesome Sin City movie. Not quite true noir, but takes enough cues from the genre in order to feel unique. Because of that we get some awesome narration. If you liked the first Sin City then you should like this. I don't see why you wouldn't, even if you don't see it as just as good. For me it was another unforgettable, awesome, dark, and blood-soaked trip back to the dark streets, and I loved every second of it."

The distinctive visual style and excessive gore is there, too bad not much else is\r First off, central 'towering' characters like Marv (Rourke) or Manute this time around look surprisingly unintimidating & unimpressive at best or just plain ridiculous for the most of the movie.\rAnd since they both on screen for the good half of the movie time it made it that much more difficult to take anything seriously.\r The writing has taken a nosedive in quality too and you can really feel it during the newly added story segments by Miller (who somehow managed to write himself into the movie as 3 different characters just for the f**k of it) , especially the whole 'Nancy (J. Alba) turning super saiyan' story line and especially the cringeworthy final act.\r Talking about the good parts of the movie, Brolin turned in a really great and stand out performance as pre-op Dwight, even though the opportuinity to bring back Clive Owen (who played the same character in the previous movie) was missed as they decided to just throw in a wig on Brolin's bold head to somehow justify the character's full face surgery and called it a day. The same can be said about the main villain of the movie - senator Roark (played by Powers Boothe) who's as menacing and power-crazed as ever.\r If fapping for 40 minutes on Eva Green's prominent body parts is not your sole reason behind watching this sequel, I highly suggest you saving yourself a trip to the movie theater.

The stylized violence and illustrative visuals make for dramatic images. Even though it goes on a bit too long, director Robert Rodriguez has created a rich, moody place."

Sin City 2  isn't a bad movie by any stretch (although some will argue that) but it just leaves kind of an empty feeling for those who loved the first one. I mean, you still get the violence, you still get the lines, you still get that \"noir-ishness\" that made you love the first one. Despite all of that, there just seems to be an overlying feeling of \"why didn't I like this more?\""

I will say I definitely came out of this film feeling a lot better than the previous one.  Mainly because it is mercifully a lot shorter than the first one and this is definitely one of the films that makes me think 3D is worth going with.  Though it still only manages to be a point above the other one and I still think there have been better films that have come out this year."

La primera pel\u00edcula adapt\u00f3 bastante bien y con bastante fidelidad los tomos de El duro adi\u00f3s, La gran masacre y Ese bastardo amarillo, solo dejaron en el tintero el tomo de Matar\u00eda por ella.\r L\u00f3gicamente tras el \u00e9xito de Sin City, habr\u00eda una inminente segunda parte a corto plazo, pero pasaron los a\u00f1os y no sal\u00eda nada, ni una sola noticia, Frank Miller mientras saca ese \u00f1ordo de The Spirit, y hace unos meses nos empezaron a bombardear con imagenes, trailers, que dan a entender entre otras cosas, que Frank Miller ha escrito nuevas historias solo para el film adem\u00e1s de llevar el tomo que les faltaba, si la primera pel\u00edcula era una muchacha provocativa, sexy y brillante, la secuela 9 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s es el aborto impregnado de heces resultante de una incentuosa relaci\u00f3n entre primos.\r Sin City 2, es una pel\u00edcula que todo el encanto que ten\u00eda la anterior, desaparece y se reemplaza por una versi\u00f3n barata y cutre  de Sin City, primero tenemos una narrativa, que si en la anterior estaba contada de tal forma, que pod\u00edas saber en todo momento cuando se situaba los hechos que te comentan, saltando al pasado y al presente sin producir ning\u00fan tipo de confusi\u00f3n al espectador que no conociese/ le\u00eddo los c\u00f3mics. En esta secuela, al tonto del sombrero y al puto loco de los cojones de Miller Rodriguez y Miller, se la sopla ordenar la historia de una manera que tenga coherencia y cae en el caos narrativo mas absoluto, provocando cosas como ponerte en situaciones que simplemente desconciertan al espectador. Las tramas, exceptuando la trama de Ava Lord (Segundo mojonazo que se mete Eva Green este a\u00f1o)  y Dwight (Matar\u00eda por ella), que es la que mantiene un m\u00ednimo de coherencia, pero las otras historias aparte de innecesarias son terrorificamente malas y que no llevan a ninguna parte. La trama de Joseph Gordon Lewitt es una historia que es tan irrelevante, tan de relleno, que la sustituyes por 20 minutos de anuncios y no notas la diferencia, la trama de Lucy (Jessica Alba), esta bien que hayas cerrado tras casi 20 a\u00f1os que la hiciste, pero a ver...TONTO DE LOS COJONES, \u00a1SI VAIS A HACER ALGO NUEVO, F\u00cdJATE EN QUE NO SE CONTRADIGA CON LO ANTERIOR!, SOBRETODO SI SALE UN PERSONAJE QUE EN ESE MOMENTO ESTA MUERTO (Y NO DIGO BRUCE WILLIS) O ALGUIEN CON CICATRICES QUE TRAS LO SUCEDIDO EN EL PRIMER FILM, NO TIENE. Luego dicen de X-Men y sus problemas de continuidad...\r \u00bfLa est\u00e9tica o al menos el reparto se salvara?. Ni eso, la pel\u00edcula tiene un reparto de segunda regional, Bruce Willis esta ahi por estar, Rourke igual, ni siquiera Clive Owen repite el papel lo que provoca que la pelicula sea m\u00e1s desconcertante, Lady Gaga eligiendo papeles de mierda como ya le paso con Machete Kills, y luego la est\u00e9tica, no se si la pelicula ha tenido mas o menos presupuesto, pero que una pel\u00edcula de hace 9 a\u00f1os, luzca mejor, es bastante preocupante, hay momentos que parecen las cinem\u00e1ticas de un juego de PSX, y con un presupuesto de 7 duros y unos FX totalmente BARATOS ya ni siquiera se dignaron en currarse la violencia todo es supercutre, cabezas de maniqu\u00edes sin detalle, lefa sangre cutre, trajes que parecen del sal\u00f3n del manga de Matalasca\u00f1as. En serio, la primera peli de Sin City esta mejor hecha que esta, y \u00a1tiene casi 10 a\u00f1os!\r Sin City: Una Dama por la que matar, es una verdadera verg\u00fcenza, chapucera, incoherente e inconexa. Rodriguez hundiendose cada vez m\u00e1s y Miller ya nos desmuestra que si en comics toc\u00f3 fondo, ya cinematograficamente esta muerto y enterrado."

      "text": "Bare **** and waggling ass, I couldn't believe I watched this on cinema. Sin City: A Dame to Kill For is a series of several short stories that loosely correlates the characters. Just like the prequel, the movie is almost completely in black and white, excluding some notable details. This noir comic inspired look director Frank Miller's signature look is undoubtedly unique. The stars are aplenty as well, however the movie unfortunately ends up being corny, ludicrous and hackneyed. It strikingly resembles 300 : Rise of An Empire, in which there's more sex and less content in a sequel.\r The story is done in old fashion crime thriller style, and it\u2019s mostly a continuation of the first Sin City. The long gap between the movies could alienate some viewers as some of the plot or characters may not be familiar to them. Regardless of the interval time, stories from this movie are not nearly as engaging. The culmination is a rather boring stroll through the city as characters come and go, but none of them brings any appeal aside from flashes of **** or **** wrapped in leather strip. This is odd since the cast consists of great actors and actresses.\r With Josh Brolin, Jessica Alba, Mickey Roarke and lots of others talent, this should be a captivating tale of a corrupt city. Yet, each story appears pointless. It\u2019s hard pressed not to wish for it to conclude and for the next one to begin only to be disappointed with the same bland effort. Characters don\u2019t stay long enough to make an impact, don\u2019t have any attraction or simply underutilized. Script is highly stylized with everyone narrating like they are writing a novel while fighting and bleeding, what leisure time they have. It\u2019s not entirely bad, but sometimes it becomes redundant and some of it can be easily translated to more visual performance considering the acting prowess of the cast.\r Graphic is exceptionally distinctive with deep focus on lighting and shadow contrast. It tries to bring the comic root, although at some scenes it just looks awkwardly unreal. Action is really silly, it reminds me of classic action or current Bollywood movie where the hero is suspended in mid-air while shooting. Decapitation and dismemberment are the norm, as well as display of unclothed bodies, and to the movie\u2019s credit, these are quite exquisite bodies, so the Mature rating is indeed adequately deserved.\r Aside from the blood, gore, and nudity, there\u2019s not much to Sin Cite: A Dame to Kill For. The plots are uninspiringly bland, but it does present more than one voluptuous dame. It\u2019s an utter hot mess\u2026 a mess nonetheless."

Sure, some stuff was going on, but it all felt a bit random. More like a dozen vaguely related events than an actual storythread. A massive shame, as the first was so good. They waited 9 years to release something mediocre. Unbelievable."

      "text": "If you weren't a fan of the original Sin City, you won't like this one either. If you were a fan you may come off a bit disappointed. As a sequel there is more unnecessary gore, nudity, and over the top \"graphic novel\" style. Unfortunately this came at the expense of things like \"heart\" and \"cohesive storytelling.\" The story of Nancy (played by Jessica Alba) coming unhinged is the closest the story comes to having a sympathetic character. There were some interesting cinematic flourishes but in general they were under-done or poorly utilized.\rPerhaps if they'd tried to tell fewer stories we as an audience would have gotten more invested in them. Or maybe if the stories were tied together in some meaningful way instead of being seemingly random. Instead we get a story so focused on its neo-noir world that the characters end up flat. I wanted to root for Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the mysterious gambler, but his character was so generic that when (Big spoiler omitted) happened I had no sympathy for him at all. It seemed the logical outcome.\rAll in all this film is an alright flick. Certainly there is much worse out there."

Jamie Chung should have been a better choice for Miho, but she was unsure in a most of her scenes. Eva green, again, sexy but not feminine enough (too goth) for Ava. Josh Brolin, at least, was good. Jeremy Piven - good. A Dame To Kill For lacked a lot of the soul from the first movie. Improvements could have been made in too many areas for this film. That's why it gets a spectacular 'meh'."

      "text": "Whatever happened to Robert Rodriguez? Where's the guy who knew how to make cool, witty films? This movie is so bad it feels almost like he's making fun of himself. Many of the fight scenes are just hilarious, and not in a good way. Though incorporating comic-y special effects could've been nice, poor execution just ruined it all.\rAnd why the omnibus style? Don't they know how to weave several stories together? It's not like there are so many stories that it'd feel too complex if you put them all together; there are three stories if you're generous enough to count Joseph Gordon-Levitt's as a \"story\". What I also don't get is why they had to introduce all of the characters at once including those whose story doesn't appear for another hour.\rThe writing is just so childish and superficial, which is ironical considering the film's \"mature\" look. The story is achingly one-dimensional, and the lines are so corny they could be used in a YA movie.\rTo sum up, this movie is visually nice but that's about it. It's amusing at best (as in I laughed at the movie, not with it). The original Sin City worked because of a mixture of things, but the filmmakers seem to have forgotten it all and focused instead on whatever looked cool to them."

Jessica Alba did a great job in bring Nancy to life it was like seeing the dance that you never saw in Sucker Punch - that's where it ends.\r The rest of the movie basically the story was boring, slow, flat, and in some ways insulting to your intelligence. Why would Miller or Rodriguez ever think this film was worthy to present to their fans is beyond me I really thought they would have done better - If you want to see some cool 3D then go see it at the theater -  but if you don't really care about 3D then wait for DVD or a Free night on VOD your not missing anything. http://scannerdrome.com/sdpodcast/"
