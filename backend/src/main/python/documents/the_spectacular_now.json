Miles Teller does a fine job playing a smooth-talking popular high school senior who relishes only on the \"now\", but I think that it was Sheilene Woodley's amazing performance that did it for me. You can see the hurt inside of these two generally happy people and you witness the vices of the lead character that emanates to the most important people in his life. Definitely one of the summer's best films."

The writing is good, but Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley (particularly Woodley) are so astounding that the characters lift the movie out of what could have been just-another-high-school-movie obscurity. By the end of the film, I was sobbing out of sheer love for these kids, sad to see them go and nostalgic for lovers and friends in high school and college that I recognized. And I'm not exaggerating--I really felt like I knew these people, which is an incredible feat considering I only knew them for only 90 minutes. They are not archetypes. They are not caricatures. These are real high school seniors.\r This movie is truly beautiful. It's a great start to Oscar bid season, and let's just say that I'd have to see MANY more earth-shaking performances from women this year in order to be convinced that Shailene Woodley (at the very least) did not deserve a nod. When I found out that she was also starring in the film adaptation of John Green's The Fault in Our Stars, I jumped for joy. After seeing The Spectacular Now, I was convinced that she was the only actress who could do justice to the role of Hazel.\r Teller, Woodley, and Ponsoldt (director) are all going places, that's for sure. Or at least they better be."

There was pretty good character development but it starts out with the stereotypical troubled teens/romance type plot we've all seen a million times so naturally we expected there must be some new twist to make this good.  Sadly the unusual or creative twist never came so we thought well then it must have an incredible ending, yet there too we were very disappointed. There's nothing new or interesting here folks so I recommend you stay away and save your money."

The 18-year-old protagonist (who could pass for 14) freely imbibes at parties, bars and clubs, supplementing that with slugs from his personal flask, often just before driving or even while at the wheel. Hey, I know it's not an after-school special. But I found this disturbing, not to mention the almost complete lack of consequences as the intelligent, articulate, supposedly popular (though he has only one friend?) alcoholic boy goes along his merry way. All that said -- extremely nice acting by both of the leads, who do look like real teenagers."

It's a very realistic and down to earth representation of two teenage lovers and how they struggle to stay together. No gunfights, no car chases, no murderers and no giant mutant squids. It's very simple and straightforward but also very sweet and charming. I was always interested despite nothing grand or particularly exciting happening, which isn't an easy thing to do. In some places it lagged and my attention was lost, but I was immersed again a few minutes later. Some major events felt slightly forced (but still true to life) and put me off even if they were significant to the movie. Coming from a rom-com loather, who thinks 90% of chick flicks should be erased from history, it was pretty darn good. Not uproariously funny or very exciting but always emotional and interesting. Worth a watch even if you're not a fan of the genre like me."

Though not so much a directorial showcase, screenwriters Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber who penned the highly appreciated \u201c(500) Days of Summer\u201d; do admirable work here. The film\u2019s simple structure hides a heavy story about a popular high school senior and his romance with a \u2018less\u2019 popular girl, his interest in finding his estranged father and his struggles with alcoholism. Most of importantly, all these issues faced by our main character Sutter Keely, begs him into reassessing his core philosophy of spontaneity. Such a simple, yet solid film was anchored by Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley (as his love interest); whose chemistry felt absolutely genuine."

While Good Will Hunting is a better film in my opinion, The Spectacular Now truly brings some new ideas and problems to the table. The portrayal of alcoholism and a kid with a drinking problem who ends up becoming a townie differs enough from other coming of age stories in the same vein to make The Spectacular Now a compelling watch.  Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley are incredible scene partners with great chemistry, and their personal struggles will tug at heartstrings. This is a really good movie in it's own right, and it's the movie that put A24 on the map. It's definitely worth checking out, and it is a must-see for fans of A24."

Shailene Woodley proves that \"The Descendents\" wasn't a fluke with her beautifully subtle and real portrayal of the awkward girl he befriends. While they create a memorable screen duo, the script is a bit slight. In an attempt to underplay the dramatic potential, it lacks much dynamic. Most of the first hour is spent creating their romance, followed by some predictable, yet mild complications. This is all dialogue and character, but the performances of these two young actors is the reason to see the film."

Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley create two people who are trying to find their place in the world. Miles drinks himself to a stupor everyday, in order to avoid dealing with the fact that his dad left, and that he's afraid of being alone once his high school days are over (his micro-universe). Aimee on the other hand is smothered by a family life, that doesn't allow her to dream. In a way, they both end up being a catalyst for each other's lives. This web of relationships is captured in a naturalistic way by the director, who captures a slice of every day life, showcasing the dreams and expectations of the young and the sadness and some disillusionment of the older generation. The two lead actors are fantastic, as is the always great Jennifer Jason Leigh and the underrated Mary Elizabeth Winstead. A very good film worth watching!"

Watching this film felt like watching the actual lives of some small town teens and the things they go through in their lives. Miles Teller is great, as are Shailene Woodley and Brie Larson. As I said, everything here felt authentic and that was in large part thanks to their acting. They all played the roles of high school seniors heading into the rest of their lives very well. The direction is also great and feels very focused. The film is certainly of a slower nature, but so much is happening in the development of these characters and their relationships with one another that it never gets boring. In addition, the relationships between them, the setting, and the cinematography, all contribute to an overall beauty to the film. As a whole, this one is great and easy to watch.

Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley give remarkably fresh performances helped no end by an intelligent screenplay. Teller is utterly charming and Woodley is believably vulnerable (so different from her Descendants turn). At the start of the film I did have some difficulty in catching all the dialogue and at first I wasn't sure if it was down to the actors' delivery or just due to appalling sound. It actually must be the former as once I got used to the performers dialect the problem disappeared. The film is basically about life growing up and all the pleasures and pain that entails. The film's tonal changes are perfectly handled (including one absolutely shocker of a moment that had me literally gasping as it was so unexpected) and the end result is surprising and richly rewarding. It's also great to see Jennifer Jason Leigh back on screen albeit in a thankless mother role. I must say that I went to this film with no expectations and I knew absolutely nothing whatsoever about it. Well, it certainly lives up to its title's adjective as it is spectacular indeed!"

Yes, it was a romantic tale set in a similar fashion along with a subplot like family issues resolved in a meaningful story. An incredible cast, especially the combination of lead two worked awesomely. These two rising stars showed their worth by giving wonderful performances.\r The movie portrays an unexpected relationship between a charming, popular, but a careless high school boy and an intelligent girl geek. They are totally opposite in character, but shares similar family difficulties and that makes them to hang out. As the times goes on, the relationship thickens with a strong connection. The school nears the end and the future plans are what stands between them tearing apart. How they react to it and what should be done is what brings the movie's conclusion.\r This novel based movie was at its best. A teenager movie that can work even for the adults. A boy who lives in ordinary 'nows' and a girl who plan for a spectacular 'future', together it became a 'spectacular now'. A teen movie with a new perspective and filled with the respectable contents. You can't get a better movie than this where most of similar themes are poured with unbearable commercial elements.

One main actor named Miles Teller plays the high school senior named Sutter  who in high school is thought of as the class clown or just a joke is stuck in the high school vibe and wants to stay in the \"now\" and not think about his future. Sutter is an alcoholic and really cant go a few hours without a drink. A day that Sutter and his girfriend break up, he drinks a lot and then crashes on the lawn of a high school girl named Amy. She is a normal girl that doesnt really stick out and with him crashing on her lawn it allows him to talk the way he never talks to anyone at school or at parties. He helps her on the paper route she does to help her mom and that allows him in his mind sort of speak give her that boyfriend experience. By him doing the paper route with her, he helps her and helps him self because he is down about himself without really showing it. The directors made the movie have a realistic relationship between Amy and Sutter. The movie has a lot of stages that effect the realtionship between them. The movie slowly progresses into the relationship and when you watch it, you see that the relationship they have is like the real world. As the relationship progresses on, Amy realizes that she is falling for Sutter but since Sutter is stuck in the mind set he has always been in, he doesnt realize he is in love with her too. Sutter has a divorced family and never talks to or sees his dad. His mom was \"protecting\" him from him but Sutter met him with Amy and went to the bar but his father wouldnt take the time to chat and hangout with his son. His dad went out with this girl in the bar and told Sutter and Amy to meet him back at his place. They waited at his place and went back to the bar after a few hours of waiting, they saw him drinking and hanging out with his friends. Sutter still drinking his whisky went into a deep state and started fighting with Amy. They faught driving down the road and almost got hit. Sutter told Amy that he wasnt good for her and told her to get out of his car. Amy crying and saying sorry to him got hit by a truck driving down the road. They parked on the side of the road with Amy's door facing the road, being hit, she got a broke arm and Sutter realized what he had done. Amy got into college in Philly and stood up to her mom on letting her go. Sutter still in his drinking mind set, didnt go say bye to Amy when she was leaving to Philly and that made her upset but she insisted for the bus to wait so she could say bye to Sutter. After she left, Sutter went to the bar and was saying he had to let her go and he was freeing her. This guy sitting next to him said he was a king and got Sutter even more drunk. At the end Sutter drove home and hit the mailbox. He was telling his mom that she never loved him and that he is just like his father. She hugged him and said he has the biggest heart and loves everyone. At the end after Amy has been in college for a bit Sutter suprises her at the school. They look at each other and still have that connection between each other."

The Spectacular Now features a cast in their 20's but actually look their movie ages, which leads me to my second point: Appearance.\rIts not unthinkable that a teen should be as attractive, put together and pimple free as so many of these teen oriented films and shows would have you believe but still, most teens don't have stylists and makeup artists polishing their look, so yeah, Gossip Girl and its ilk feel inauthentic to the average teenage experience because of something as basic as looks. Shailene Woodley's bare, makeup-less face is not the only refreshing thing in this coming of age film that has great acting, writing and casting (Bubbles! Coach! Saul!). Most noteworthy of all, the film avoids the clich\u00e9s usually associated with the genre and is an intelligent study of youth standing on the precipice of adulthood, hesitating to move forward, something most teens can relate to.\rVerdict: Watch."

Miles Teller was really excellent, adding wit and drama; but Shailene Woodley's charisma and honesty made this a very personal film, one which carries a message and a memory. We may all perceive this film differently, but a message will be carried by all; a feat few films achieve.\r Watch this film; simply to feel if nothing else."
