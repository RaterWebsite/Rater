It may not be the most original feature, nor does the solution suggest any improvement in the world future, but we are talking about an individualistic project, right? When Malorie calms down, the film calms down too, and sees no need to move on. The direction turns a global catastrophe into an intimate event, an impulse for the sad woman to overcome her trauma, to reconcile with the maternal instinct and find happiness. Maybe a few billion human beings will be sacrificed along the way, but you can't make lemonade without squeezing a few lemons, right? For the final smile of Sandra Bullock and the sense of peace explored by the framing and the sound, the martyrdom was worth it."

The first one was \"The End\" which ended in the main character and his SO in a car covered in a cloud of dust before the credits roll. In Bird Box the sanctuary from the monsters turns out to be a school for the blind. Now what is a school for the blind doing tucked away in the middle of a forest and how does Rick give such an accurate description of how to get there down the river, when he is blind? Where are they getting their food from? What makes their place any safer than the original house Malorie and the kids were holed up in? What happened to all the other blind people in the cities - there should be thousands of them still alive. Why is it even called Bird Box??? The box of birds is in barely half a dozen shots in the entire movie. Urgh. The more I think about this inconclusive and dumb ending the more enraged I become over the fact that I spent two hours watching it.To sum up \"Bird Box\" is what happens when The Walking Dead meets Oregon Trail."

A lot of aspects of the plot are changed, and made ridiculous, or cheap, and the good performance from Sandra Bullock doesn't prove itself enough to carry the film through its missteps. The second half is especially changed drastically, and made more \"dramatic\" rather than intriguing (I mean, screaming \"Don't take my children!\" in the middle of the woods wouldn't have been a solution in the book.. just saying...). It's an enjoyable movie, and the cast carries out what is asked of them, however, lacking originality and faithfulness to the book, and not transcending the horror genre formula, \"Bird Box\" just isn't what I was hoping it would be."

The acting is so annoying and was trying so hard to give an emotional weight to the story, that it just fails as a result.The art of filmmaking has become the art of an extended full-length filler television episode, nowadays.

What a terrible, terrible movie.Sandra Bullock portrays a really unpleasant character, very difficult to root for. The beginning of the movie, where everything goes crazy, is ok, but too similar to the happening. But in The Happening, at least we had some kind of explanation, as lame as it turned out. In Bird Box, the writers just don't bother. It's implied this is some kind of demons, whatever.In the end of course, nothing is resolved, because that would take creativity. I kinda hate this kind of movie where the world goes to an end, and we follow a tiny bunch of characters until they get to safe place. It seems like a happy ending, if you forgot that the world is still crazy out there. Anyway... Dialogues are boring and endless, just like in the walking dead. And characters act stupidly, just like in A quiet place. By the way, this is a rather long movie (>2h). I would recommend not to waste your time on this one. Really not worth it."

I had a couple hours free and noticed that sandra bullock was featured in the decent trailer so I decided to give it a watch. This film is a good and hearty thriller, it does draw a lot of parallels with other films of the same genre but has enough character to make it original. The film manages to create an incredible sense of unease and unpredicatbility that is key to the success of a thriller, so much so that I felt exhausted when it was over. The acting was good with some characters and character plots similar to the walking dead (back when that show was good). The story jumps about a lot to different times and locations which is quite annoying at the start when you just want the film to progress. Quite surprising though was he themes explored in the film and was actually quite successful in conveying emotion. The story does follow a typical apocalypse narrative so you find yourself thinking to yourself \"when are these people going to argue about having to go out and get supplies\" and sure enough they do. Some charcters are just there to make you feel sorry for them and their innocence, which makes it obvious they are going to get killed off. Sarah Paulson featured quite briefly in the film but I thought she could have offered more to the film. John Malkovic was ok, I think he is well rehearsed on playing a short tempered, problematic character. Sandra Bullock's performance was ok, she delivered lines in her usual tone but has something about her that makes her acting quite enjoyable to watch.Overall, I think this movie will be enjoyable for those who enjoy thrillers and for those who just happen to stumble upon it themselves without being influenced by the recent viral spread of this movie with people running about with blinfolds on, I mean the promotion of this ovie was so awkward I half expected Joan Crawford to come running in swinning a fake axe."

These are not people who care about the art of cinema, but middle-to-upper class modern, trendy millennials and/or people who have a fetish of playing a streaming service in the background while having sexual intercourse because, for some reason, that is cool--\"Netflix and chill\" anyone?So, in comes \"Birdbox\" directed by Susanne Bier. This follows the perfect recipe for satisfying the mass. It is a shallow, easy-to-follow post-apocalyptic survival flick but with a twist so that after watching it, the entitled pretentious viewers can again pat themselves on the back and think they are knowledgeable about the art just because they enjoyed a film so laughingly trying to be deep, that the evil entities are not even shown. Ever! \"Wow! What an abstract avant-garde piece of revolutionary art\"--tweets Carol, from her iPhone, feeling pretty good about herself. But in truth, this is nothing more than Jackass (except not funny).There is no insight into anything. Those presences causing everyone suicide are never revealed to us, nor they are mentioned. This would be fine, if the film would actually do something with this mystery. Instead, it tells us that it is so in-depth, so complex, so multi-layered that dude, like, we won't even show them, but wait not even mention them, and you know the two kids in the film? They have no name--they are simply called \"boy\" and \"girl\". \"This is something else\"--says Carol; \"This is a shameless cash-grab\"--I say while struggling to shake-off the modernist cringe.Every single one of these characters is as shallow as he or she can be and every single interaction is linear and boring; not to even mention the predictability of the whole thing. For its entire run-time, I was waiting for each character to inevitably die. This film is about as complex as a classic zombie-horror flick, except there they actually put the effort into the zombies, while here they do nothing and just put some lazy pretentious mumbo-jumbo.In the end, what makes this a revolting film (if I could even call it that) is the fact that I do not think this shallowness is unintentional. Netflix is all about business, and here they completely killed the art form and, like the creatures in the film, replaced it with a populous void. Profitable, but disgusting."

The film is not without its effective set pieces and suspenseful moments, but sustaining that suspense with the building threat of seeing two children commit suicide just makes the entire film seem cheap and exploitative. Rather than embrace the tawdry 'B-movie' shocks bubbling beneath the surface, the director and cast instead insist on treating the material like they're in a prestige pic while never finding the emotional heart, psychological depth, or cultural significance of its central premise. Because of this jarring disconnect between tone and material, the film fails to work as a literary art film or as a genre thriller. Ignore the anonymous voices online telling you you have to see this movie to understand the phenomenon. I recommend taking the advice of the movie itself and keeping your blindfold on."

You know that bias where even if a product like Insatiable,Bright or...well,Bird Box fails miserably at being a piece of media,everyone just straight loves it for no reason other than \u201cyou critics are just mean\u201d? Because,after the 30 minute mark of explaining the concept,Bird Box did just what Jurassic World 2 did to my inner film fanatic soul. It p****d the hell outta me,this time more than JW...And this isn\u2019t a franchise movie,not even a Universal movie at that. This is made by Netflix,whose social media I hate with a burning passion,and rarely makes a great movie (think Okja or Roma),because they\u2019re so busy making teen garbage (with exceptions like Stranger Things and the Marvel TV Shows) that,while they appeal to that demographic successfully,they\u2019ll always miss two things that make a movie or TV Show good,not so good or bad. \u201cEntertainment\u201d and \u201can interesting PLOT\u201d.And Bird Box doesn\u2019t have that. It\u2019s a soulless cash-in on A Quiet Place that fails at being what they\u2019re aiming for or,even worse,lacks anything worth of its \u201cGenre\u201d. This is listed as a Horror movie and man,oh man,does it not show anything worth of the Horror. Not even the kills are fantastic. This movie is so bad,It\u2019ll instantly kill your brain cells because they were busy doing something else.But let\u2019s start at the beginning.The acting is probably the biggest highlight of the movie. Surprises are here and there,since I only knew Sandra bullock was in it. Well,surprise surprise,John Malkovich,Rosa Salazar and Trevante Rhodes also appear in here and they\u2019re all pretty good! Especially Malkovich and Bullock,who are trying to make us care about everything coming from a stupid script.A script full of dumb choices,situations being finished in no time (even faster than The LEGO Movie,a great movie with a fast story),a presentation that fails with a snap of the fingers,and 2 moments where Venom now feels like a fantastic script (The quote \u201cWow. Such Venom\u2026\u201d,the car flipping at the 11 minute mark and the eyes being weird when they\u2019re \u201cinfected\u201d by this monster). Speaking of the monster...Uhh...Where\u2019s the monster? Do I have to believe about this floating fart who infects people in killing themselves? Yeah,that\u2019s actually dumb for a script that wants to be taken super seriously.Oh,and there are kids in here,and they\u2019re even worse than Claire from a bad but miles better movie than this (Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom). Worse in the sense that they don\u2019t even act. They\u2019re standing there like pieces of wood,or even rocks.The technical aspect is also really bad. The cinematography feels like a great YouTube video and rarely does it feel like a cinematic presentation. The score feels like a great mix of nothingness,horrible synthy vibes and a track that a composer like Junkie XL would cry from disappointment. And to finish everything,the editing is Justice League level bad,where even the little things fail at connecting the dots (where in JL i was the gun thing,in Bird Box it\u2019s a person in a bedroom looking at another person,then we cut to the same person,only her head is looking to the closed window).GOOD GRAVY GOD,this movie made me angry. Bird Box made me hate Netflix as a studio more than Universal just because of how the platform\u2019s users act IN IT. I don\u2019t care if you love Bright,it\u2019s just an aggressive 4/10. I don\u2019t care about Insatiable,it\u2019s a dumb show with nothing special that makes the Catwoman movie look like The Dark Knight. Stop raving about Bird Box,you dumb TNTs. It\u2019s a great Asylum rip-off (or cash-in) of A Quiet Place that has nothing special and is just there to please some guy who wants their brain to be rotten. But yeah,dislike this review,because your opinion will be better than mine for all the wrong reasons. I hope you have a future filled to the brim with classics such as Fifty Shades,Twilight,Bird Box etc. and \u201cHave a nice life\u201d (-Venom)"

There are so many obvious similarities in this film especially to \"The Happening\" from 2008 as well as \"A Quiet Place\" from earlier this year. When it does try to be it's own thing at times, it comes off so contrived and cliche and I personally couldn't take it seriously. There are so many tropes and moments that are so familiar and unoriginal. The story is told in a somewhat interesting way and Bullock's acting is serviceable like always but it just lacks an overall originality which has become a trend in most Netflix original films unfortunately aside from a few. I felt as though they tried to make this more of a testament/symbolism to being a mother than anything else and maybe that's why it's scoring so well among the average Netflix demographic. There are moments of set up atmosphere and intensity that never lead to anywhere where I guess you're supposed to use your imagination which I find pointless when watching something that is meant to show the culprits before your eyes in the thriller/horror genres. The suspense is empty when it's meant to be full. Overall this is just a long dragging attempt at being a clever thriller drama that doesn't deliver any originality but is watchable I suppose. If you want quality original horror on Netflix, watch The Ritual or The Apostle."

      "text": "The first scene set the story up very well with the conversation, things happening on TV and paintings. I also enjoyed how the movie doesnt try to over-explain or over-show, allowing the audience to use more brain and imagination. Good use of the color blue on sandra bullock. the birds in the box and the human characters. a bit weird at certain points of the movie when malorie acted a bit out of her character by standing up for others when she was not good at making human connections.Unfortunately, I saw the trailers and that has ruined some of the movie for me. The second half was also not as good as the first half. I particularly didnt enjoy last 15mins, with the characters just wandering off into different directions. The ending reminded me of the babadook which babadook did a much better job. I was also very puzzled as to how 2 of the characters were not given proper names at the beginning..."

      "text": "Bird Box is probably one of Netflix's most successful film to date.  It is a huge hit that even leads to various memes and dangerous attempts to emulate the characters in the film. Folks....driving a car while being blindfolded is not recommended in any situation. Beside the fact, I found this film equal in quality to its 'twin': The Quiet Place.  While the latter received heaps of praise, both films share a similar premise and equally thrilling experience.  Both are not genre changing, Oscar breaking flicks or took you into a deeper sense of dread, such as the excellent Hereditary.    In this case, well suited to be watched while eating your popcorn at home."

      "text": "Bird Box is a fun enough, especially when you are at a party and this is on in the background, or if you are hanging out with friends and want to watch a light scary movie. That's a good way to describe it: \"light.\" The movie falls apart under any serious scrutiny, and it's honestly just a rip-off of \"A Quiet Place\" but it is enjoyable in spite of it's straight-to-TV-movie production value. The cast is great, and Sandra Bullock does a great job. However, it's definitely not one of Netflix's best."
