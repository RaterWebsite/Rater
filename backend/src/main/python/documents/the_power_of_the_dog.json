Loved the Piano and other works, but this film is a predictable tired display of modern PC culture to which professional critics feel obliged to herald, because of it's fleeting importance of subject matter. This film has been made many times within the last few years. It's extremely cookie-cutter and a low point for Campion. As one can see the user reviews are way lower than the obligatory handouts pro-critics have been giving it. That is not a mistake by viewers, and you're not missing anything that these pro critics are seeing.  I also cannot take Cummerbatch as a cowboy.  It just doesn't work for him. A shame too, as Plemons and Dunst truly shined bright. The only two beams of light to be emitted from this bland attempt at Campion staying relevant.  Bummer for sure. And painfully snoozy.  Throw some award noms at Plemons and Dunst, and just walk away, as those two performances are the most redeemable portions of this film."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "I watched a DVD screener so I was bombarded during the opening credits by \"New Zealand Film Commission.\" plugs.  It was almost like a tourism showreel.  We get it, it's not Montana (where the film is set), it's Lord of the Rings again but couldn't you at least wait until the closing credits before breaking the fourth wall?  I found the movie incredibly gloomy for these covid times.  The acting was great, especially Kirsten Dunst, Benedict was perhaps miscast, the music was grating, overdone, and the cinematography was great.

Music and cinematography make it seem like something tense is brewing, but no plot developments happen until the last 10 minutes. The only female character (though well acted by Dunst) is so undeveloped she is just a wilting flower - we're led to believe she is so weak that her brother in law playing mandolin a bit loudly and not coming to her dinner party was enough to torment her into alcoholism, despite the fact she apparently already survived one husband's suicide and ran her own business just fine. We are given no insight into the inner worlds of any characters and are instead left guessing at the meaning of it all."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Very very slow and boring.

First of all, its filmed in New Zealand that is very clear, the two brothers are still sleeping in their childhood room, but their mother and father have moved out of the house (why) never explained. The movie moves from the marriage, to being a drunk to her son in medical school in 10 minutes. Phil went to Yale really since he was having an affair with Brono Bill when did he have time to do this? And how did her son know that he would find a cow dead from Anthrax lucky find. There were HUGE holes in the story line, and I could not figure out why this movie would get any nods.

Seeing the fear in that horse's eyes was heartbreaking. I researched the animal abuse, and it is real.  Further along in the movie, I read that Benedict also castrates a bull.  Why is this abuse necessary and tolerated?

Such is the case with writer-director Jane Campion's latest, a disappointingly underwhelming effort from an ordinarily reliable auteur. The chief problem here is an often-thin, sometimes-obvious, frequently unfocused story (with a script to match), one that's principally an essay on the dangers of toxic masculinity as explored through life on a 1920s Montana cattle ranch. The film seeks to examine this issue through a variety of story threads, most of which are far from fully developed and lack coherent correlation save for the behavior of a somewhat cliched, mostly monodimensional protagonist. To its credit, \"The Power of the Dog\" features gorgeous cinematography, strong character development, a fine period piece production design, a captivating original score, and excellent performances, especially from Benedict Cumberbatch and Kodi Smit-McPhee. Yet, even though these strengths come close in capably covering the material's inherent weaknesses, they're not enough to elevate the film to the level of greatness or to live up to much of the undeserved hype many critics have heaped upon it."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "(Mauro Lanari)Jane Campion gets back to make a film after 12 years: allusive and not suggestive. It is the viewer's task to fill in the gaps in the story, but anyway, while trying to understand the motivations of the protagonists, one realizes that they are not charming enough to be worth it. \"The Power of the Dog\" falls into the traps of that smug aestheticism that has marked a part of the New Zealand director's cinema, so \"it's like 'Brokeback Mountain' but even more boring\"."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "OMG soooo boring. The first two times I tried to watch it I fell asleep. Had to drink a Red Bull on the third attempt just to stay awake. If a movie is just about pretty cinematography we don't need directors. The cinematography is great, and it makes for a good trailer, but there is nothing here. And Benedict Cumberbatch is so miscast. He looks like he only weighs 110lbs soaking wet. Not a very ominous threatening figure at all. The plot drags on like a broken cart being pushed uphill. Jane Campion hasn't directed a good movie since 1993's The Piano. Who keeps hiring her? I have no idea what the Oscars was thinking with all the nominations."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Power of the yaaaaawn. Nothing happens for a looooooong time. Cumberbatch is totally miscast as a roughneck American. Portentous music telegraphs tension that the film totally lacks. Pass!"}, {"rating": "0", "text": "I had high hopes for this film being that I am somewhat familiar with the director and wanted to see a female take on the western genre. I read the book it\u2019s based on more than twenty years ago but I have to say the film was a disappointment. It all starts with cowboy rancher Phil not taking off his chaps or hat indoors which no self respecting cowboy would do, he wears spurs all day everyday and speaks with a horrible American accent. I could forgive this since Benedict was pretty good but the whole movie is a There Will Be Blood ripoff. From the cinematography to the soundtrack to the shots it seems to be a film students take on the source material who hasn\u2019t found her own  voice. I am appalled at the critical acclaim and the fact that no \u201cprofessional\u201d critics noticed the similarities with There Will Be Blood. I guess as long as you\u2019re a woman making a gay cowboy movie your lack of originality can be overlooked."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "Look, in short this movie has a queer coded and violent antagonist who is killed by a neurodivergent young adult. Even if you excuse these blatant and outdated tropes, this movies legit sucks. It is not tense, it is boring. The cinematography is ruined by the horrible script and one note acting by Jesse Plemons and Kirsten Dunst (I\u2019m sorry Queen I think you can do better). If you need to rely on queer coded villains in the year 2021 well then you\u2019re just a horrible writer. Get off your Hays code era bs and write some actual drama. This movie was lifeless and dull.  Beyond relying on horrible tropes, this movie just has no inspiration. You want the fall of the Wild West personified? Go play Red Dead Redemption 2. Go read All The Pretty Horses. Go drink half a bottle of Makers and slam your head against a wall. You will gain a greater understanding of the west by doing any of these compared to watching this slow rotting corpse.  Legit 0/10 I will scream about how bad this movie is I cannot believe it is a Metacritic must see."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "im sorry, but i dont understand the critical acclaim of this movie.  it is one of the most boring movies ive ever seen. the actors themselves performed brilliantly, but the story was sleep inducing. i give it a hard pass."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Despite some impressive visuals the script is just terrible and fractured.

Anyone who knows the first thing about Psalm 22 knows it's a prophecy foretelling Jesus's suffering on the cross. The interpretation in which Cumberbatch is the \"dog\" and Dunst is the \"darling\" is anti-textual nonsense. Also, the movie is boring, passive-aggressive drivel. The whole plot hinges on some nonsense about burning piles of extremely valuable cured animal hides, which no one would ever do.  If you think this is a film about cowboys doing cowboy things, it's not. If you think it's about characters making logical choices based on competing interests, it's not.  If you think it's Jane Campion jumping in a time machine to complain about how awful she thinks our great-grandfathers were, taking whinging pot shots at \"toxic masculinity\" through a post-modern lens but with cowboy hats on, you're right on the money."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "I do not get what the fuss is about. I once heard or read a saying about ambiguity not being profoundness - and this movie is bang-on ambiguous. I can only imagine that it is its ambiguity that's been taken as profoundness.Two brothers - both weird, one's a bully and then stuff happens. All this set in the old west, so the movie is a western - it does not have a reason to be but it is. To its credit, the movie holds your attention and lingers on and on - as if something is going to happen, but nothing especially does and then the movie ends.It definitely has some talent and quality - but for some reason the not-main-actors (i.e. The extras/bit part) were its most interesting bit.

While beautifully shot, it tries to be too many things, and fails at all. Phil is not the villain we're led to believe, nor Rose the saint. George is practically absent, as is any kind of weight to any of the characters. Their motivations are entirely mysterious to us and never resolved in any meaningful way. If this is about toxic masculinity, as Cumberbatch recently lectured all us menfolk on, where is it in this film? Is Phil toxic? Or a product of his times? Is Rose noble because she, lost her first husband? Has a gay son? Married George? Or are we seriously supposed to believe that Phil picking on her was the source of all that suffering? In the end, Phil is the only one who tries to make a meaningful connection to Peter.If this is some diatribe against toxic masculinity, the only thing we learn is that Campion has no idea what that is."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Unnerving stuff. I'm not one for westerns so getting convinced to watch this was a challenge but im so glad i did cause what this western has surpasses those Americana clich\u00e9's.

Benedict is a powerhouse as the conflicted Phil who's repulsive vulnerability pulls you in whilst leaving you feeling as if you're walking on a tightrope.
