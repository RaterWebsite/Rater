The insight and themes surrounding this brilliant science-fiction film have depicted that somehow we ourselves are unsure of what is real and what is not.

Brilliant performances by Bruce Willis and one of the best performances of Brad Pitt in his acting career. Great movie."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This is one thought provoking, disturbing, and ingeniously constructed film.  It may have even inspired Looper, but I found this film both superior in style and plot.  Terry Gilliam always creates strange, disorienting worlds.  When I first saw Brazil I really didn't like it at all, but I might have to watch it again after viewing 12 Monkeys.  The performances are all incredibly convincing and strange.  Willis gives perhaps his most mortal and desperate performance, and Pitt goes full retard as a crazy animal rights activist, showing that he possesses an acting range which I thought he lacked.  I don't want to spoil things, so I'll just say that the plot needs to be paid close attention to at all times and it will definitely keep you on your toes.  If you're a fan of sci-fi or mindbender films at all then you need to see this creepy and unique vision."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I love this movie so much and I can't even explain why.\r Like, there's so much going on but it's not a mess, it's all in its place.\r All in all, something refreshing."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "\"12 Monkeys\" is a modern classic, inspired loosely by Chris Marker's \"La Jetee,\" but taking the concepts therein to a new level. This is Gilliam's second-best movie, after \"Brazil,\" but it's still head and shoulders above 90% of the stuff out there. A thought-provoking script, fine acting, wonderful visuals ... \"12 Monkeys\" has it all."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "When 12 Monkeys was released, it was hyped as: 'Bruce Willis is in a madhouse! Is he really crazy?' Buzz was mostly negative, but with a few enthusiastic endorsements. Since that is usually the sign of crap-- the rare endorsement almost always a shilly affair-- I stayed away. Well, I just watched this movie because it was a monthly freebie on digital cable. I'm here to say that 12 Monkeys is a fine movie, and I really enjoyed it. Most 'good' thrillers and time-travel films have clues that you need to look for on the second viewing if you want to know what happened, if you really want to find out why the film was 'good'. Or, the 'good' film shows you directly, in a big reveal, so that no explanations are necessary for anyone with an IQ over 80. 12 Monkeys, however, if you are intelligent, puts everything right in front of the (observant) viewer's face and doesn't play any tricks; there's no filmmaker dishonesty or bait and switch involved, which is incredibly refreshing. Willis and Stowe are quite good together; their growing intimacy is convincing, and their relationship becomes the non-cheesy center of a sci-fi time-travel film. (Not to sound too creepy, but the many close-ups of Stowe's lovely face were not at all unpleasant; her transformation from concerned psychiatric professional to a modern Cassandra with her hair down is a real pleasure to watch.) The film's major, glaring flaw is Brad Pitt, who is so over-the-top and verbose in his role as a certifiable ingrate gazillionaire scientist's son, that one wonders how much better a film it would have been without him. His manic and too-clever by-half exposition doesn't seem to disturb Willis, yet Willis (apparently like Gilliam) could not reign him in. Art direction of 'the future' is where 12 Monkeys seems most like a Gilliam film-- the environment of the survivors on a post-apocalyptic Earth looks something like something from Time Bandits, with modern technology apparently cobbled out of chain-link fencing, old TVs, 50s-era medical instruments and the guts of grandfather clocks. Willis' performance is weakest after his transformation (which I won't spoil); he is simply too contrite; a lighter touch would have been much more powerful. Anyway, this review is getting long. If you've always thought of 12 Monkeys as a cheap sci-fi thriller starring Bruce Willis that nobody really remembers or cares much about, I suggest that you watch it. I promise that you will be pleasantly surprised."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "An endlessly entertaining, head-twisting sci-fi time travel tale directed by the great Terry Gilliam so everything is off-kilter.

Bruce Willis is unsettling and crazy in all the right ways, and Brad Pitt is neurotic in all the best ways. There's no fairytale world in this movie; just a great big messed up fantasy. To decipher what's real, what's fake, what's in the past, what's in the future could take forever, in fact, it might even be impossible. This is the great mystery of this film."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Maybe if I saw this movie 10 years ago, I would appreciate it more, but the time travel philosophy in this movie was absolutely pointless. Everything was very predictable, nothing intriguing and wow factor that hits you. And when it does in the last 10 min, you realize the absurdity of the movie. It's just another time travel paradox, an endless cycle of trying to change the future, yet whatever you do, that exact future is coming. The movie touches upon parallel universes at least unlike Back To The Future, but the looping cycle is flawed. I really like time travel movies, and so I thought this movie had a complex, fresh, imaginative, thought on time travel, but yet it's nothing you haven't thought about. I did like the psychological part of time travelling however, and the acting was well, mostly by Brad."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "This film was both too confusing and broing and as for the ending, its a joke, pathetic. if you are going to find out who the killer is then make it a big character not some ginger haired idiot.....A failure for Gilliam, on a kinder note the only reason i give this a 2 is for Brad Pitts unbelievable acting, his best peice to date, too bad the movie was rubbish!"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Thought provoking."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "An impressing achievement of filmmaking for Mr Gilliam, as well as very cool acting by Brad Pitt. there are some people who will find this clever \"complex\" and just totally a good film all around. i am definately not one of them. i found it confusing, sadly boring - and yes - a bit too long. i ended up feeling dizzy with a headache at the end. Despite this, there are some aspects of the film i felt intrigued by, such as in the beginning with Bruce walking around in the suit, or Pitt dressed in the tux in the fancy mansion watching Bruces character run off - it was cool to with the scientist scenes talking to bruce. as the film progresses, i felt it lacked entertainment for my taste. i am completely mixed opinioned on this movie. The Mental Hospital scenes were cool, but Mr Pitts last few scenes dragged in ultra dialogy nonsense that just gave me a headache.

It's not bad at all, it's just not what I wanted. Willis' acting is completely natural in this movie for how out-of-place his character is. Brad Pitt is excellent in his role, he nails it perfectly. The music is mainly just reconstructions of the hypnotically enticing theme to the film, but overall is silent aside from a few classic songs. The plot is a bit confusing at times, but if you can get your head wrapped around the idea of it, it's really interesting. I recommend it for people who like Sci-Fi as well as good thrillers.

Twelve Monkeys is certainly ahead of its time and the influence can be seen on mind bending films today. The usual Gilliam techniques are used on a script that potentially was designed for a very different vision however it is Gilliam's uniqueness that makes this film stand out, let alone the fact that the cast members wanted to work with him whatever the cost. In most cases that was for very little. Gilliam's style combined with the solid a-list cast and performances make the potentially messy plot become overlooked. The absurdity of the narrative makes for intrigue and works with the time-jumping story telling. In hindsight it is definitely the perfect script for a director such as Gilliam. The score can feel out of place, the emotional development of the two leads relationship doesn't feel deep enough and there is a slight lull in the middle however this is a film that must be seen to see classy performances from actors at the start of long careers and a narrative that leaves questions open for you to answer yourself on either a second viewing or in discussion down the local."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "I'm rating this movie a nine because at the time of release, it was definitely one of the cleverest movies made.

The science fiction elements are great and really thought provoking about what we consider to be insanity. In addition, Brad Pitt was absolutely fantastic. He killed his role here and really stole the show, not to say that Madeline Stowe or Bruce Willis were not good, because they were. This one certainly keeps you guessing until the end and really sinks its hooks deep into you and does not let go until the film is over. The only thing about this one is that I saw in some places that it is considered a satire, though I never really found it funny. Sure, Pitt's over the top performance is at times funny, but for the most part, that is about it.

Before I will try to explain just why this movie is so horribly good I just want to say that I don't often enjoy a movie as much as this one. Movies like Star Wars, The Matrix and Back to the Future pale and shudder in comparison to this heavily underrated star among filmmaking. Those movies were good, certainly, but not executed as flawlessly as this one. For this title alone Terry Gilliam should be raised above and beyond other directors. The only movies I have enjoyed as much as this one have to be Scarface and Pulp Fiction. I honestly don't know why everyone agrees that those movies are masterworks, but doesn't put 12 Monkeys besides them on a pedestal. This movie is more than worth it.\r Why is this movie so damn good? Well first of all it is slow. I like slow movies. When bits go flying from one end of the screen to another you must make sure to have build up a lot of tension before doing so, or the bits flying won't have any impact whatsoever. This movie builds up to a lot. The entire movie is basically build-up, and that's the way I like it. The ending felt appropriately heavy and important.\r The movie is also very smart. The plot is interesting, the little bits and pieces of social commentary scattered around are always welcome, and the overall premise requires attention. Perhaps this is why it isn't on any must-watch list, but for me the amount of intelligence this film needs was perfect. For the entire duration of the movie I was trying to figure out what everything meant and how the story was going to end. It had me completely gripped in thought about this movie, I did not once stop to wonder about anything else. That is sheer brilliance in my book.\r I also loved the way the story changed completely for maybe 4-5 times. It makes sure things stay interesting. The way this movie works with bringing things you have seen before back, but with some more general info, is the best. It just is. It doesn't dumb down to explain things to you either, it expects you to be smart enough to recognize it yourself, and link it back to the story yourself too. The story requires you to pay attention and think about it, an art that is lost in popular movie-making. It is gripping, more so than any film I have ever seen.\r And the general setting of this movie (usually in places with insane people) just works for me. It's a personal preference, but I love this movie for the same reason I love the original Terminator: the setting, both of the future and the present, is completely perfect. And Brad Pitt isn't usually my favourite actor, but he was perfect here. And so was Bruce Willis. Even the casting was top notch.\r Straight out 10 out of 10, could not find a single damn flaw. No-one can ever do this kind of movie better than this."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "12 Monkeys is a great movie of the 1990s. One of Bred Pitts best roles. Great pseudo thriller.
