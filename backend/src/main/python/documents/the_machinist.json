Anderson has create the type of movie where the viewer never knows what's real and what's not, and there is a reasonable doubt to everything. Once it is revealed why the situation is like it is, everything makes sense. Aside from that, Christian acts wonderfully and is obviously committed to the role with how much weight he had to lose.

The most interresting thing, however, is Bale's appearence.

It's mostly shots of Christian Bale looking at his emaciated body in the mirror. The film is a slow and painful plodding toward a twist ending.

Its quite atmospheric and does well at making the viewer feel on edge, seeing things from the main characters point of view, making us question his frame of mind and wonder what will ultimately happen. I was very aware of the way the lighting was done, in that it appears as if most things are in either black and white or greyscale, almost as if the colour has been literally drained from the people and objects we view. Of course that can be  linked straight back to the main plot of the main character being in a less than refreshed and energetic state.Christian Bale does well portraying the main character - he certainly looks very much on edge and paranoid, almost ghostlike in appearance after a while, with dark rings appearing around his eyes. I found it to be quite an intriguing, tense and engrossing watch. Its the sort of film where you find yourself guessing what might happen next, whats to come. Its an edgy watch, not entirely scary as such but certainly fairly gritty and probably not an ideal watch if your not keen on (if but mild-ish) jump scares. The music featured had a Hitchcock-ian feel to it - I suppose the film does have a bit of that about it, although thats not to say I'd compare it directly with the classic directors work but for a film of this type, its certainly worth seeing. Unsurprisingly, overall, I would definitely recommend this film."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "What we have here is a disturbing, distracting but important thriller which explores the boundaries and broken states of not only the human body, but the mind as well, powerful as it is, it can also deceive to the point of self-destruction and doubt of oneself. Christian Bale is the almost unrecognisable lead in this sombre and dark piece, he plays a machine worker in a factory by day, and sits in an empty airport cafe by night, trying to overcome his year long insomnia. When we meet him, he seems to be in an unhealthy yet manageable state, going about his life, but Bale cuts a gaunt and sunken figure, losing extreme amounts of weight to play the part if routine worker Trevor Reznik, a man who alienates his co-workers and does the exact same thing day in and day out, until something shakes his routine and he begins to experience horrific events that he cannot explain nor can he piece together. He turns to a call girl called Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh), the only real friend he has, to get a second opinion on his dilemma.\rThe Machinist studies the effects of traumatic events and how one can choose to repress and forget, Reznik is an emaciated yet focused individual, living a life by black and white rules while also trying to keep on top of everything through sticky notes and cleanliness.  While the film studies the emotional impact and aftermath of life-changing events, it often tries to hard to hide its predictable plot which begins to unfold, this definitely distracts what could have been a near flawless thriller, but the deliberate attempts to mask the unwinding story and the distracting appearance of Bale at a mere 121 pounds stop this from happening. But there is still a thrilling story and an excellent performance from Bale, who clearly throws himself into his work and commits to the experience, there are of course arguments about how much actors and actresses get paid, but this is a prime example of money well spent, while harmful to himself, Bale proves his loyalty and willingness to his work, the performance outweighs the sombre and often slow paced film, it has an overall decent approach, but inconsistencies and deliberate out of focus points towards the audience, stop it from being truly great."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Christian Bale seems to be the reason for most The Machinist hype, and their's a good reason for that. Bale's portrayal of , insomnious, Trevor Reznik is something he really devoted to doing. Still with Bale's great acting, as well as the supporting cast's, are not the delivering factor. The cake goes to Scott Kosar for this amazing script. The Machinist delivers all the suspense and thrills a great movie in this genre need."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "When I watched this movie I actually realized that this is my first time I see Bale playing the role. I mean it was not just a guy with Bale's face (like in Batman or Terminator), he actually played that skinny insomniac Trevor Reznik, and he did it just great. The movie has a lot of catchy features, good atmosphere, nice picture with all that pale colors. Pretty decent and original thriller to me."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "This film is solid.

He is certainly a fantastic actor who is great at everything with losing weight to get into the character. It's quite shocking to see his body going through like this. In this he plays Trevor Reznik, a machinist who has insomnia and hasn't slept for a year. It has one gory scene where Michael Ironside's arm came off at the machine. Trevor apparently has seen two accidents like I said today that Michael Ironside's character had his arm come off and a young boy having a seizure at \"Route 666\". There just loads of things went into his head since he doesn't get enough for a whole year when he has nightmares. It's quite like an ambiguous ending in American Psycho. I really was gripped at the chase scene after Trevor got run over by a car causing a hit and run. This film is so astonishingly psychological it grabs your attention in order to understand what Christian Bale is going through. It's kinda like Fight Club and Memento which I haven't seen before but those elements go through together in The Machinist for how evocative it is. For how much a gripping psychological thriller it really is. The twist ending is quite depressing but you know how this goes."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "This film makes you feel uncomfortable, but that's the point. Christian Bale is, once again, outstanding.

As embodied by Christian Bale, who lost an astonishing 60-plus pounds in preparation for the title role in \"The Machinist,\" Trevor isn't so much flesh and blood as a walking ghost, a chronically sleepless, gaunt-to-the-point-of-pain (ours, mind you, not his) wraith of a man. As it turns out, he's a character so haunted by himself that he is turning into his own ghost.\r Much has been written about Bale's physical transformation for this film, a remarkable display of starving for one's art that should go into the moviemaking record books on the page opposite Robert De Niro and Vincent D'Onofrio's legendary weight gains for \"Raging Bull\" and \"Full Metal Jacket.\" While the results of Bale's shocking, special-effect-free emaciation occasionally threaten to become a distraction for the audience, especially when the previously healthy-looking actor has his shirt off, they are an essential visual metaphor for the film's message, which comes into full, dark flower only in a clever twist at the end.\r Despite containing an implicit lesson about sin, \"The Machinist\" is structured less like a morality play than a straightforward mystery thriller. As it opens, Trevor, an employee of a soul-deadening machine shop, hasn't slept in a year, and he would like to know why. He'd also like to know why several other strange things keep happening to him lately, such as the appearance of several cryptic Post-it notes in his dingy apartment, and the arrival of a creepy new employee at work (John Sharian), whom it appears only Trevor can see.\r Then there's the accident.\r After inadvertently causing a co-worker (Michael Ironside) to lose an arm in an industrial mishap due to his own inattention, Trevor's insomnia and paranoia (with possible hallucinations) get worse. Soon, he comes to believe that not only are his co-workers out to punish him for the incident, but that his up-to-now understanding hooker-girlfriend (Jennifer Jason Leigh) may be in collusion with one or more of his tormentors. Trevor's only solace? The graveyard-shift waitress at the local airport (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon), an angelic, almost maternal presence whose nightly pie, companionship and coffee -- as if this man needs more caffeine! -- are the few things that keep Trevor sane.\r Or are they?\r Tautly scripted by Scott Kosar, and directed with quiet, nightmarish intensity by Brad Anderson (see Film Notes on Page 39), \"The Machinist\" is psychological suspense at its finest. Shot with a cold blue pallor and edited with a somnambulistic lethargy that belies the urgency of its subject matter -- the nature of guilt and innocence -- the film feels at times like you're dreaming it, rather than watching it. Taking its stylistic cues not from today's crop of horror films, but from such masterpieces as Roman Polanski's \"Repulsion\" (1965) and Ingmar Bergman's \"Hour of the Wolf\" (1968), it makes even scarier that most scary of bogeymen: the human mind."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Hmmm... critics divided.

From the first twenty minutes, the film continued in a predictable manner. With a main character who was frankly clueless and showed absolutely no prior thought behind his actions, it made me feel uncomfortable to watch him try to figure out the mystery that unfolded. Although the end of the movie wasn't necessarily unexpected, it wasn't surprising, and almost came out of the blue. This film wound up being a desperate attempt at the avant-garde, and didn't really work as well as it could have."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "A good movie, with a great interpretation of Christian Bale.This movie was very enjoyable to watch. It's a thriller based on Trevor's paranoia, a factory worker who begins to believe that a newcomer to the service is trying to plot him. Of course, the fact that he has not slept for a year (a form of chronic insomnia that, for the simple fact that the character has not gone to the doctor, is hard to believe) probably has something to do with these obsessive thoughts. At her side, privileged spectator of her drama, the prostitute Stevie, who is at the same time friend, advisor, confidante and romantic interest of that machinist. He has no friends, has virtually no one, and will slip to the brink of madness, gradually.The script is both the strong point and the weak point of the film. In fact, the story itself is good, interesting and holds the public to the end ... but let's face it, it has little originality. He remembers a lot of other films, particularly \"Memento\" or \"Fight Club\" (two older films where Scott Kosar and Brad Anderson (the director) were probably to drink some inspiration. I remember a mixture of these two films that I mentioned, although this does not remove any merit or quality from him, of course. It's worth seeing this movie just to see how this actor indulges in his character.From the technical point of view, I found it very interesting to use blotted colors, without heat, to pass through the film the coldness and absence of human warmth felt throughout history. The main character, a man uprooted and on the verge of madness, experiments and is the center of all this coldness. The plays of light and shadow, the soundtrack, all contribute to make the film and dark, somber."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "The Machinist is yet another movie that looks stylish, is well acted, offers an intriguing plot - then goes on to begin looking overly familiar. It\u2019s obvious the filmmakers had an admiration for Hitchcock\u2019s \u2018Psycho\u2019, Polanski, Kubrick,(etc), and that\u2019s OK, but to then re-invent something that you-wish-you-had-made is little more than a form of plagiarism. There needs to be more than look-a-like characters, borrowed writing and directorial touches, similar musical tonality and photographic touches \u2013 there simply needs to be more \u2018originality\u2019 for anything creative to be regarded as genuine involving art. The fact that lead performer Christian Bale, starved himself to the point of illness for this role is, dedicated to his craft, yes -but also pointlessly (and foolishly) over the top. The addition of the moviemakers (and writers) obsession with oral sex offered absolutely nothing to the main plot, so why? This work goes on to offer up one gross situation following another --for the sake of crude shock value--lacking true artistic integrity.  Great (or even good) work - needs more than style and look alike value to be fully deserving of any worthy respect. An interesting try but, an overall fail. Lovers of \u2018downers\u2019 will be close to the only audience attracted to this ugly, overreaching morbidity."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I enjoyed watching this movie.The eerie feeling that it makes you feel can almost put you into a psychosis and Christian Bale played the role wonderfully.The soundtrack was great and i enjoyed the plot twist in the end.Overall a pretty enjoyable experience."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "If it just didn't insist to be Memento.....!Anderson and Kosar managed to convey the state of mind of Reznik in a way that's as remarkable as Christian Bale's shocking body transformation and terrific performance.

Still, it's a quite taut and suspenseful psychological thriller.(8/10)"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "The Machinist is a mysterious film and in my eyes a very good film. We follow the life of Trevor Reznik, who I have to work with machines, and he doesn't seem to like the job. So you can feel that aversion to it, but at the same time he knows that he has to do the job. I do not know how to describe it. I liked the atmosphere in this film, which was underlined by Christian Bale, who plays the main character here. Absolutely phenomenal figure, emaciated to the bone. Bale really went crazy here, but on the other hand, he probably did what he wanted to do, to create a quality mysterious film that gets to a completely different level after an unnamed bald man appears, but I won't spoil it anymore. Overall, the film is mysterious and so mysterious, but after watching it is quite clear how it is, even if it is not and you have to think about it, or find an explanation on the Internet.

The Memento comparisons are warranted, but this is a far superior film. Memento was more of a whodunit disguised as a psychological thriller. This IS a psychological thriller. In Memento (a film I thought was alright, but terribly overrated) you are one step ahead of the protagonist through much of the film and the ending was fairly ho-hum. The Machinist, on the other hand, really delivers the goods. You are just as lost, confused, and helpless as Christian Bale (doing his best work since American Psycho.) Throughout the movie, I found myself asking the same questions he was asking himself. Why can't this guy sleep? What's the deal with his mysterious co-worker Ivan? Is he a hallucination? Is this whole thing a hallucination? Why is it always 1:30? Are his co-workers really messing with him or is he just paranoid? How do the hooker and the waitress fit into all of this? The ending is both satisfying and surprising. You won't see it coming (not entirely, at least) but it fits the plot in a logical way. None of that non-sensical surprise ending crap. This could have become a trainwreck of a movie but Brad Anderson handled it deftly. Unless you're one of those people who can't take movies where you won't know what the hell is going on most of the time, definatley check this one out.

You look, you feel sorry for the dog, but you really don't care to know much more. Feed it, or put it out of it's misery. That's what I wanted to do to Bale's character in this movie. Instead, I had to sit through a plodding telling of a pretty boring tale. As provocative as the hallucinatory/psychotic effects from a year of sleep deprivation were, they just didn't make up for the flat, tedious story. Yeah, we knew SOMETHING big happened to make this guy so screwed up, and if the ending delivered that something big, I could have forgiven the rest of the movie for being so lifeless.
