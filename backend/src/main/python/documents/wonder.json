      "text": "Incredible, inspiring, heartwarming emotional roller coaster of a movie, a parade of heart tugging moments with the sole intent of leaving you in floods of tears. Not my cup of tea but Wonder is suitable for all ages and definitely worth your time.Jacob Tremblay stars as Auggie, a young boy entering mainstream school for the first time and with that comes the obvious problems. Bullying, making friends etc. It seemed like every scene was trying to outdo the previous, determined to push the viewer to their limit and overwhelm you with emotions. I understand the message the movie is getting across, tolerance, compassion but at times it felt a little much at driving home the point. Wonder practically writes itself, playing out exactly how you'd expect and contains little surprises but it tells the story in a unique way, taking the story of Auggie and looking at it from different perspectives which adds that extra depth that the story definitely needed. The world doesn't always revolve around Auggie and the character development for the rest of the cast was perfect. Tremblay is absolutely brilliant, surrounded by a great supporting cast and tied together with a story you can't help but get drawn into. A real crowd pleaser, recommended and don't forget the tissues."

Obviously they wouldn't go too over the top for the makeup cause they obviously didn't want anyone off put by it or anything, but I seriously could barely tell that he looked \"different\" unless I looked closer. Again, not terrible, decent for the family, but just not enjoyable and disappointing for a followup to a book that good."

      "text": "\u201cWonder\u201d might not win any awards, not even mentioned for any, but it is one of the most heartfelt, moving movies of the year. It is a story of many loves: between a mother and son, mother and daughter, father and son, father and daughter, brother and sister along with what it means to be different.In this case Auggie was born facial deformities and had to go through many operations to be able to talk, see, hear, among other things. His mother stepped off her path to home school him which was a must due to all the surgeries but decided at the age of 10 Auggie was ready, had to, join the real world and started him at middle school where most of the kids would also be facing a strange world.Kids can be cruel to each other, especially to those who are different, and Auggie is taunted, classmates being ugly towards him, afraid of touching him thinking he might be contagious, not being friendly to him but ostracizing him, making fun of his looks and generally bullying him. Due to his facial abnormalities he looks forward to Halloween so his face can be covered with the kids not knowing who he is and he can cat, be, one of them.Based on a best-selling young adult novel by R. J. Palacio and adapted for the screen by Stephen Chbosky, Steven Conrad and Jack Thorne \u201cWonder\u201d it is a film for everyone who have had to deal with problems, people and just life in general. \u201cWonder\u201d is about children and adults made for children and adults.Jacob Tremblay, as Auggie, had a breakout role in \u201cThe Room\u201d and follows that up with a different acting challenge meeting it head on and makes Auggie a real child with all the problems a child faces learning, knowing his deformity is just another one. His older sister Via, played superbly by Izabela Vidovic, loves her brother but knows she had to be shunted aside by her parents while Auggie was in and out of hospitals. As he starts middle school she is just starting high school after her best friend, Danielle Rose Russell, returned from a summer away a different person than the one she was. She also meets Nadji Jeter who introduces her to the school theatre group.Of the other children all come across as children you knew when you went to school. There is Noah Jupe as Jack who befriends Auggie and unknowingly turns his back on him, Bryce Gheisar as Julian the lead bully with his own group of followers who make things worse for Auggie and when Julian is faced with his bullying his parents stand up for him.When it comes to the adults the principal, Mandy Patinkin and his homeroom teacher Daveed Diggs treat Auggie as just another kid while Ali Liebert, a science teacher, backs Auggie\u2019s interest in science and his class project. Sonia Braga\u2019s cameo as Via\u2019s grandmother has an effective scene with her granddaughter.Jacob Tremblay is the star of the movie but Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson, as parents all kids wish they had, contribute not only as loving, supporting parents but parents who deal with the problems their younger son has to face. They are both warm, strong people yet you see the concern as she sends her boy off to school and the realization that both her children may soon be leaving their home. Wilson is the fun dad, the one who can make his kids live safe and who can act as childish as they do yet let them see how much he also loves their mother.Director Stephen Chbosky does an excellent job showing the home life, the school life and the social interactions, both negative and positive, between young people, moving smoothly bringing emotional times, looking at and answering hard questions, while showing the most important lessons both kids and adults need to learn.\u201cWonder\u201d is a film parents can take their children to without embarrassment and both will be entertained, share recognizable moments from their own relationships with each other and others and during the 133 minutes of the film bringing the audience along for the ride and involve them emotionally."

      "text": "When this book was recommended to me, I was excited because I suffer a genetic glitch, less visible than Auggie's, but I've still faced bullying and discrimination because of it. Reading the book was so severely frustrating for me because it was for the readers who relate to the people around Auggie. Auggie's behavior wasn't realistic and it felt undermining that a fictional 5th grader had more forgiveness and tolerance than I did at his age. The movie made it worse if anything. It's frustrating to me that this book and movie is so celebrated because every time I see it sitting on a shelf, I'm discouraged."

      "text": "I will admit by the end of the movie that while it was done well, and truly draws out genuine emotion out of the viewer (a few guys in the theater were dabbing their eyes, too), I found it almost too realistic in one aspect that was a major part of the story -  bullying.    I was a victim of incessant and relentless bullying as a junior high schooler through about the ninth grade by a bunch of cowardly rednecks who delighted in making miserable anybody who wasn't athletic and especially if they were from somewhere else (my family moved from a Midwest state to the South when I was 12) and were smarter.    While I fortunately didn't have the deformities that afflicts the hero of this picture, I nonetheless recall the horrible treatment I received without any justification, and lived in a virtual state of terror until high school when I grew up a lot, and one of the ringleaders moved.    The rest didn't have the brains to carry on his orders against me.    So, even today at 56 sometimes the memories haunt me.    So while I never reciprocated and bullied anybody younger or weaker than me, seeing that it would be just as bad as those who were harassing me, resentment and anger helped scar my life well into my early '20's.    This is important because \"Wonder\" does a good job of showing how terrible, mean and stupid our \"precious\" kids can be.    While the movie ends well, and is done thoughtfully with fine acting by all involved, it does give us an idea of what some of our kids suffer through, with or without a disability.    In one scene, one particularly mean little jerk is sent to the administrator's office for numerous verbal and other attacks against \"Auggie\", his parents are defensive, belligerent, and refuse to believe their little angel could be capable of the very acts he's committing.    And frankly, in the real world, victimized kids don't turn the school into admirers except maybe for a more compassionate and intelligent friend or two.    I don't recommend this movie for anybody being bullied, or who suffered at the hands of these cretins, boys or girls.    It may be just too painful to relive.    It touched a life long raw nerve with me, and while it's a fine movie, I do not want to see it again.    Society is full of adult bullies too -  bosses, co-worker idiots, stupid neighbors, control freaks, who can't handle anything that isn't their way, abusers of all sorts, etc.    I don't want to pay to see that behavior."

As it proceeds, the narrative opens up in a heartfelt and inclusive way towards larger points about the values of friendship and how one person can \"raise the bar\" on Emotional Intelligence in a small community.    As a writer myself, I want to underline how innovative and thoughtful the script.  Thank God the performances do it justice.    The many child actors are all wonderful and--I know unheard of and hard to believe--all major minor actors have actual character arcs (run, get the smelling salts; he passed out!)"

      "text": "This is a great movie, let me just say that.Based off the best-selling novel, Wonder centers around a young boy named August Pullman, who was born with facial deformities, as he tries to fit in at his new school, Beecher Prep.The movie is one of the most heart-churning emotional movies I've seen this year. It shows us how the way you look doesn't change who you are on the inside, that we shouldn't judge one another for the way they look or the way they dress or behave, that it's the heart deep down that matters. At least once I saw August face a problem whether it be bullying or trying to fit in, and thought \"Hey, I've had to deal with that once.\". The movie makes us remember the hardships we had to face through school and life as a kid. It makes you look at this young boy and understand the pain he feels, and feel sorry for him. When he's happy, you're happy. When he's sad, you're sad. When he's angry, your angry. The movie masterfully conveys our emotions, which is what drama movies should do.If you're wanting to treat your kids to a movie that gives them good morals, Wonder is your movie."

The characters were pretty bland and they didn't make me invested in the story. The movie has a great message about bullying, but the message would have been more powerful with better acting. I know people just like Auggie, and I can say the character he is portraying is entirely unrealistic. The movie had forced romance, and tiny bits of unfunny, and bland comedy mixed in. I rate dramas based off how emotional they make me feel, and this film did not accomplish its purpose. I appreciate the movies wonderful and kind message, but it just wasn't for me. With better acting, no forced romance, no cheap dusts of comedy, and more realistic character portrayal, we would have a very decent film on our hands. But instead, we get a pile of mushy drama and forced quotes shoved down our throats."

Acting in the movie is universally great - Owen Wilson plays Owen Wilson as always, and in this case it happens to fit rather well. Although the plot largely lacks surprises, the juxtaposition of the different points of view for some of the major characters, including overlapping some of the timelines of the story works very well, adding a bit of interest to an otherwise linear, albeit entertaining plot. This is simple, feel good popcorn movie fodder, with a message that is particularly needed in current times; \"if you have a choice between being right and being kind, choose kind\"."

His homeschooling mom (Julia Roberts) decides it's time for him to go to school with other kids and that's when the conflicts begin. Children can be cruel and this film piles on the unkind acts. The narrative actually veers away from Auggie's plight several times to detail the stories of people in his orbit. This film is a step above Hallmark sentimentality, thanks primarily to strong performances by the entire cast and direction by Stephen Chbosky that generally veers away from taking the maudlin way out.

In all honesty, I like every role that is presented in the movie, it makes me think the characters in the book must have been real fun.I would voraciously disagree with anyone who thinks that is same old spongy sorry sod like story that tries to wring out the tear ducts. In fact to avoid a situation like that, Auggie with problems while still being the center of the universe, the movie is divided off into pieces where his family and friends are given space to be explored. The aspects of school and student life - The overlooked elder sister, the estranged best friend, the jittery friend-to-be, the mother who sacrifices so much, the perfectly beautiful family with seen and unseen scars. It is so well done.There are no easy answers to some curve-balls life will always keep throwing us; but it is so much better to have people around us who care for our existence and are in a symbiotic emotional relationship that positively uplifts us. That is what this movie is all about - about memories, about love, about compassion, about family, about friends, about choices you make and the chances you take and perhaps a few more unsaid things I may have overlooked. I know not if I have convinced and helped you make up mind on what do about this movie, I were to end with here with one last suggestion - Don't judge things by appearances, at least try to be fair, and watch this movie.

It is awesome to see the perspectives of not just the main character, but everyone else in his life as well. Standing up to a bully is much easier said than done, but this movie shows the overcoming of fear to stand up for your friend at a tough age. The only thing that seems controversial to me is that the main character has a pretend face that was created by makeup artists.

But, it\u2019s warm, tender, and intelligently thoughtful too!  Movies and TV have become so cynical and ugly these days that it\u2019s often all too easy to forget the importance of being reminded - just how essential human kindness remains.  R.J.Palacio\u2019s perceptive novel has been transferred to the screen with professional production values - inviting us to look back and recall a gentler attitude and how important balanced human relationships are \u2013 especially to those less fortunate than most. It\u2019s broken into segments that invite us to understand the motivations of many of its main characters and the complex intertwining relationships they have with each other \u2013 this is done cleverly and without feeling episodic.  Some may find it too saccharine (and at times it might be) but, it still made for a refreshing change and was good to be moved to tears by an encounter with human goodness instead of human trash.  This suffering world certainly needs more, and looking at the HUGE box office returns the suffering patrons agreed!Top performances from youngsters Jacob Tremblay (\u2018Room\u2019 \u201915) playing August (who, along with another child actor Jaeden Lieberher -\u2018The Conformation \u201916) bring a professional innocence to their screen characters. Lovely Izabella Vidovic is marvellous as his patient but emotionally suffering sister. Most adult roles also add to this movies special appeal.

I think the movie is really good in transmitting the character's emotional and the camera positions always helps on capturing that but while is a emotional movie it's still fun when you see him doing good and it helps us to learn to treat people better more often because sometim es it really impacts some people."

Everyone from his sister, his parents, his best friend, his sister's best friend, even the bully to a lesser extent, they all get a chance to be more than they would be in any other movie with this same story.While it definitely relies on very common tropes and clich\u00e9s, and it can feel a bit emotionally manipulative (one particular subplot felt very forced just for the sake of tears), this was an very emotional experience that I highly reccomend if you just wanna watch something very, very sweet."

      "text": "I knew the basic story of Wonder before I saw it and I assumed it was aimed at kids but I think its the kind of film that works well for both kids and adults. There's certainly a fair amount of food for thought, as it were. Unsurprisingly, it is quite sad and sentimental, although I'm glad to say that I didn't feel it was unnecessarily piled in sugary sweet emotions - it focusses on the childs difficulties starting at a public school and his reaction to being made fun of for his looks. I suppose it is perhaps a little predictable but I thought that it wasn't as tacky as it perhaps could have come across and also I thought that the main cast did pretty well in their respective roles, especially Jacob Tremblay as the main character, August aka Auggie and Julia Roberts as his mum. It deals with bullying, fear/shame and so on - important topics for adolescents certainly.Would I recommend it? yes I would."
