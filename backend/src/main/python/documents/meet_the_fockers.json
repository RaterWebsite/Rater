This movie abandons the original and creative comedy of \"Meet the Parents\", in favor of the same old \"potty\" humor we see everywhere else. About the only cheap comedy gag they didn't use was dressing men in women's clothing, but I'm sure if they would have thought of it, we'd have seen DeNiro in drag."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "In Meet the Parents the hapless Focker (Stiller) met his fianc\u00e9es parents and, while it was far from perfect, it certainly provided enough laughs to make for a worthwhile watch. This sequel, which now see's Fockers hippy parents join in on the act, is a pale imitation however despite the all the acting talent on show. There are a couple of humorous scenes but most jokes, for me at least, just fell flat meaning I was bored well before the final credits of what is a fairly lazy sequel."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Eh it was ok. It didnt dwell on the first film too much but it didnt do enough to really set itself apart either. The cast is good but the story is too generic and features a lot of generic jokes.

It was a solid film overall and was well worth watching.

It was like writers have 1 night to write their homework and they have started pretty late. I remember it was so boring I could not wait the end.

This sequel is so appallingly bad I wish I could erase it from memory. I'm not sure what audience they were going after but they abandoned all the fans of the original. If you find the sex life of old people amusing then this might be for you but seriously, how long can you laugh at the same stuff again and again. Avoid this gutter trash and, unlike the original, definitely don't let your kids watch it. They'll just get depressed (and disgusted)."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Liked it as much as I did the origial. The addition of Hoffman and Streisand definently added new life to the film.
