Former \"NYPD Blue\" director, Gregory Hoblit, makes a really good film about every other picture he directs- \"Primal Fear\", this movie- not so good ones- \"Fallen\" and \"Hart's War\", etc.. But this is his best work IMO.Dennis Quaid plays an FDNY firefighter in 1969 Queens who connects with his 36-year old cop son (Jim Caviezel), living in the present-day, through an old HAM radio- all due to some highly localized electro- temporal spatial effects caused by unusual aurora borealis activity. A serial killer investigation going on at that time ends up coming into the mix, and the two work together to prevent more murders. Brilliant!I know there have been some comparisons with \"Ghost\" and \"The Sixth Sense\", but really, this movie stands on it's own. One of my favorite character actors, Andre Braugher, also co-stars as the best friend of Quaid's character , and Caviezel's partner in the present day.
