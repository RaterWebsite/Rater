      "text": "Based on the 168 minute version.\r There's no denying Quentin Tarantino's twisted genius and perverse vision. His films are unapologetic challenges to share the roller-coaster as long as one accepts Tarantino run the ride. No one seems to mind. It may be time to challenge that precept.\r In a \"Playboy\" interview, Tarantino stated, \"I just don't want to be an old-man filmmaker.\" Pure Tarantino, \"The Hateful Eight\" is poetic, profane, laconic, really nasty, bloody as all hell, and meditative; the first half - uncharacteristically old man-y, moody and brooding with meaningful dialogue sharp as a razor. There's promise of a re-think as if Tarantino's voice finally broke to adult from adolescent. Then the film derails to the usual Tarantino high jinks.\r This filmmaker is a master at creating tension; cinematic foreplay teasing and teasing until big, sweet, orgiastic release in blood and guts. He also deconstructs and spins plot twists and turns into gold. That task is easy in, essentially, a stage play with eight trapped in one room. A Tarantino film with social commentary as text, the subject under the microscope is race hatred. Setting the film post-Civil War allows the saying of things unacceptable in contemporary society. Like \"Django Unchained,\" nary a few minutes pass without a \"ni**er.\" And the room is divided into North and South.\r The length works against this film. At 168 minutes it was quite enough. The added twenty-odd minutes in the roadshow version might make the experience interminable. The film runs out of steam as it plays out and plays out with dialogue between the bang-bang \u2013 and there is plenty of blood.\r Then there's misogyny. \"The Hateful Eight\" revels in the abuse of Jennifer Jason Lee, even with her portrayal of a scheming, cold-hearted killer. Her multiple beatings and battered face appears as if a domestic violence victim \u2013 most unappealing.\r The cast does well with the material. There are no standouts, really, but Tim Roth channels Cristoph Waltz who must have been busy.\r The cinematography is spectacular. Not necessarily the lighting, but the incredible use of the wide screen frame. The look and feel is evocative of David Lean epics Tarantino emulates even to the use of 'Roadshow', a practice that passed out of favor fifty years ago. Films are no longer shot this way. In this regard it was a pleasure to watch.\r If Tarantino wished to create the emotion of hate in the audience, he succeeded. The hate spills over the footlights, but there is a fine line between using verbiage and posture to underscore race hatred and making a racist (and misogynistic) film. More than in other films, \"The Hateful Eight\" crosses that line. This film again leads to question Tarantino's personal attitude. He becomes more suspect peppering scripts with \"ni**er\" - even in his contemporary films (joining real life \"Black Lives Matter\" protesters notwithstanding). Sometimes racists hide behind satire and commentary. Every use of \"ni**er\" is another nail in that coffin. Also, his neurotic mentions of big black c**k in several films (here, sucking) skews toward wish fulfillment.\r This is a very distasteful, caveman film within grand entertainment. That push-pull leads to a zero sum, and self-reflection as to what exactly is entertaining about \"The Hateful Eight.\" Given the dichotomy, not a lot."

      "text": "Definitely the most cynical Tarantino film yet, with no likeable characters and a focus on violence against over character development of plot. I've never believed the criticism levelled at Tarantino that he glorifies violence until I watched this. Really enjoyed his last two for films as they seemed to be making a statement and we're a lot more focused and purposeful. With Hateful Eight Tarantino seems to be just churning out a film for the sake of it. Imagine a film that removes everything that gives a film soul and leaves you with nothing but a nasty, exploitative mess wherein the actors become more like charicatures of typical Tarantino characters. I think he should either stop making films or have a serious look in the mirror and try to rediscover what makes a film exciting,namely characters you can engage with,  relate to or empathise with."

Jackson. And now for the film. There's probably one big problem for most people here and that's the pacing. The movie is almost three hours long and not much happens for about an hour and a half. I didn't find that a problem and I'm not even a Tarantino fan. I don't mind slow movies in general, but for a lot of people, half the movie will probably be an ordeal. Later on, things start to happen and the plot gets pretty interesting and raises a few questions, which are of course answered at the end and you are left with a clearer picture when the film is over. What added to the film's juice were the frequent n-words, which Tarantino just isn't afraid of. I enjoyed myself and although the film was slow as I mentioned, I personally found it interesting. I don't know whether to recommend it then, because after all the pace probably won't suit everyone. In addition to that, the film changes a minimum of locations and the plot takes place in the same place, which will probably also displease a few people and I was a bit disappointed at the beginning, but it gradually stopped bothering me because I just found the plot interesting. For me, the film was great and I'll put it this way. I recommend it to fans of the director, because his style is classically signed here, for example in the form of chapter divisions or the occasional narrator speaking into the plot. Perhaps even more fans of the genre might find it fitting."

It\u2019s all about human traits, and this might be a meh-film for some, but a masterpiece for others. But it sure isn\u2019t a wild action-western.

Too slow plot, too dialog-driven, too stereotypical & a lack of plot-development & top-notch humor, might be flaws for some.

What's sad is that it starts off wonderfully -- I felt myself\rgetting excited by the prospect of Tarantino returning to form for\rabout a half hour -- then keeps getting sillier and sillier until it's\rnothing but a comedy -- and the comedy is so unsubtle, it might have\rbeen made by Mel Brooks or Jerry Lewis on acid.\r What's funny is the much touted, rich color of the Panavision stock and\rthe fake cabin interior of \"Minnies Haberdashery (not a hat in sight)\"\rmakes the film look like the over-saturated movies from the sixties\rlike \"Paint Your Wagon\" which always looked vaguely fake to me -- a\rplastic universe cobbled together on a back lot and lit with huge\roverhead arc lights. Add big splashes of red blood and it started to\rlook like the garish color of some the 60s Disney films, so there was\rthis bizarre set of associations going through my head.\r When the finale of the film turns to grand guignol slapstick in these\rhyper-pumped colors, I felt like I was having a flashback to a bad 60s\rDick van Dyke comedy like \"Fitzwilly\" or \"Cold Turkey,\" and, honestly,\rI left the theater stunned by the near absurdity of it all. It's as if\rsomeone unearthed an awful 60s comedy (Sergio Leone? Hah? That's a\rlaugh) that was buried in the vaults by the studios.\r This \"love letter to the cinema\" is really a love letter to himself, as\rTarantino riffs off elements of his own movies like \"Reservoir Dogs\"\rand throws in some steals from Paul Thomas Anderson (it almost sounds\rlike Anderson doing the narration. Narration? Where the $%^& did that\rcome from? Wow, talk about the weakest attempt I've ever seen to clue\ran audience when some sloppy structuring fails the film.)\r The dialogue is Tarantino-lite, like a second-rate writer trying to\rimitate him (Samuel Jackson's goading of Bruce Dern is probably the\rworst monologue Tarantino has written) and the story is Agatha Christie\rwith a lobotomy. There are some good performances (Kurt Russell is\rgreat as John Wayne) and some awful ones (Tim Roth at his over-the-top\rworst) but the film itself unravels like a spoonful of spaghetti\rWestern. And this isn't a spaghetti Western, it's a pizza and beer\rcomedy. I'm sure it will be a big hit at frat houses across America.\r I'm amazed how some people (known critics, as well) even venture to\rjustify the racial undercurrent as social commentary. Tarantino has\rnever written symbolically or allegorically. He writes character, and\rthat's that. \"The Hateful Eight\" is a \"political statement\" in the same\rway that \"I Spit on Your Grave\" is an indictment of contemporary\rreligion. Please.\r How do I sum this movie up in one word? Well, the one that comes to the\rtop of my head right now is: \"Goofy.\" Maybe those big Panavision camera\rgot to Tarantino because he subconsciously started to think he was\rmaking a bloody version of \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.\"\r\rI need to have a drink.

But I in cowardice looked away and waited for the movie to get better.

Everyone is horrible. Everything is violent. Everything is.... well... just gross. To make matters worse it's frekking BORING! After a relatively hopeful first half hour or so with a few funny bits, some smart dialogue, some dramatic building and beautiful scenery... the thing basically becomes a bloated whodunit play with every other line containing the word **** or **** I was so bored I nearly fell asleep two hours in.

If you\u2019ve seen Django Unchained, then you know he\u2019s pretty loose with the n-word, too. Some people called it \u201cauthentic,\u201d but I felt it was a little jarring. There was a point early in the movie when one character drops the n-word and another character says, \u201cYou know, black people don\u2019t like to be called that.\u201d At this point, I wondered if this film would be free of the n-word, or at least very light on it. Psych! The rest of the movie is very heavy on the word.\r The movie itself seemed like a stage play. One character walks up to another character and spills his entire life story as an introduction. The second character responds by spilling his entire life story. Both stories serve as an introduction for the audience, but come off as un-natural. I had a writing teacher describe this as \u201csoap opera dialogue.\u201d It was odd to see it on-screen. The Broadway production of The Hateful Eight is gonna be huge.\r The gore was heavy\u2026 In some parts of the movie I would consider it over-the-top.

If you\u2019ve seen The Kingsman, and you call that a \u201cten\u201d for violence, I\u2019d call this one an \u201ceight.\u201d It sneaks up on you, too. For the first part of the movie, little to no violence. Then BAM! Violence is hot and heavy. There\u2019s at least one scene where I think there was violence just for violence sake\u2013I don\u2019t think it was realistic for that character to act that way.\r If you put the language and gore aside, how was the movie? Well, it\u2019s quite a lot of both to put aside, but I\u2019ll try. It definitely put you into what Wyoming during a blizzard in the Old West would feel like. The sets and costumes looked terribly authentic.

It oozes authenticity, and is an eye-opener to what life was like in the Wild, Wild West.\r But the language and gore\u2026 It was tough to stomach. Was language really that rough at that time?

The story outline is a mere strand and it is overblown to epic proportions (a staggering 187 minutes) that it cannot possibly hope to sustain. Things start promisingly enough with Kurt Russell\u2019s bounty hunter escorting Jennifer Jason Leigh\u2019s Daisy, by stagecoach in a raging blizzard, to her date with destiny on the gallows. En-route they meet up with Samuel L Jackson and Walton Goggins before holing up with the rest of the titular number in a cabin which is the home of \u2018Minnie\u2019s Haberdashery\u2019. The torturous corkscrewing of the plot plays out from here, but interest is lost after a while due to the overly talky first half. The intermission when it comes is almost a relief. Things pick up considerably after the break and the screenplay introduces flashbacks, narration and a plot twist that livens things up no end. These devices are, in fact, Tarantino\u2019s forte. This second half also lets rip in the blood letting department and anyone who has seen a Tarantino film before will know exactly what to expect. The cast have a lot of fun, with the best performances coming from Samuel L Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leigh and, especially, an unknown Walton Goggins. The film is technically proficient, although when the actors are competing with both Ennio Morricone\u2019s forceful score and the sound effects of the raging blizzard, much dialogue is lost as a result. The 70 mm presentation is stunning and Robert Richardson\u2019s cinematography of both interiors and exteriors is ravishingly beautiful. It may not be vintage Tarantino, but despite the flaws it somehow manages to stay with you long after you have left the cinema."

      "text": "Hateful Eight is an entertaining film, but Tarantino's previous work is better. The dialogue, plot, and characters are simply not as good as in his previous films, and the whole thing feels a little bit tedious and drawn-out.\r It's certainly still fun to watch and has all of the characteristic Tarantino things, but they're just not executed as well and feel a little obvious and tiring. For example, the film randomly throws in characters with non-American accents just for the hell of it rather than having a serious reason or explanation. Also when you really get down to it, the story is very simple and doesn't need to be drawn out for so long."

The characters are crude two-dimensional jerks, the cinematography is nothing special, the plot was weak and would have been better told in the span of twenty minutes, not three hours. Maybe the film would have been saved had it had better pacing, I'm not sure. However, the gentleman sitting behind me who had fallen asleep and snored for a good hour seemed to fit right in with the atmosphere of the movie."

It seems more suited to a play or novel.\rBasically, if you want to hear the backstories of the rootinest, tootinest Yosemite Sammiest bad boys of the Ol' West told over the course of 3 hours of painfully slow one-on-one deaths, watch this.\r Whoever leaked the script was doing the director a favor. He should not have made this film."

The Hateful Eight had so many major story problems, huge plot holes, a narrator that appears halfway through for no good reason, that it took all the fun out of the spectacle. This should have been called 8 Actors in Search of an Author, or maybe 12 Angry Tropes."

QT used to have a talent of making conversations between characters really interesting and funny, not in this movie.  The script is total trash.  After 2 hours of crap conversation I was over it, especially after the 'gay' oral sex rape scene...\r Obviously QT has an axe to grind re US history and racism, and QT went for a record on how many times the word ni##a could be used, it gets very old and boring about 30mins in...\r Tim Roth's character was rubbish and his 'speeches' were pointless and unbelievable.  The mexican character started well then was never used properly.  It was essentially a movie where the overblown script ruined every chance to connect with any character, much of the movie should have been left on the cutting room floor.\r Then there was the narration from QT about 70mins in, where I thought I was listening to a Directors cut special on a DVD, it was so bad, and also ruined any tension that may (or may not) have been building.\r Crap movie, don't pay a dime to see it, I'm still a little shocked at so many 'fan boys' who will never say a bad word about QT, this movie was a shocker, one word BORING :("

      "text": "Snowy, cold, over lengthy, bloody, theatrical. These are the main keywords for this movie. All events occur in one location, the rest store for travelers \"Minnie's Haberdashery\". The first half of this more than three hours show is extremely boring with long dialogues involving racism and almost no real events. The second half is packed with violence after the plot of the gang was revealed. Now, which gang? The theatrical show is about a gang who killed the rest house owners to free the sister (Jennifer Jason Leigh) of their leader, sent to be hanged by a bounty hunter (Kurt Russel). The plot is spoiled by the arrival of a hangman (Samuel Jackson) and a would be sherif (Walton Goggins). The acting in general is good specially by Samuel Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leig, Kurt Russel, Walton Goggins. Directing is pretentious, the scenario is not for a movie packed with places and moving. The opening music is nice and reminds the Good, the Bad, the Ugly and for Few Dollars More. At the end of the more than three hours, no one is left alive, blood is shed generously every where. All in all, a \"show\" that can be missed; if attended you have to be patient or have nothing else to do."

While the characters are cool, the twists do come, the film's shot well, and Ennio Morricone's score is great, the rest of the film, much unlike Tarantino's usual films, felt overwhelmingly boring and derivative. It did not have nearly the level of action or interest as in films past, the film's plot and dialogue drags on and on, and its near 3 hour self-indulgent running time is far from necessary. Overall, this film was far from one of Tarantino's best and one of the most underwhelming movies I have seen from a critically acclaimed director in a very long time."

      "text": "I saw this because Inglorious Bastards was fun, and because Jennifer Jason Leigh is an unparalleled actress but she's about vanished this past decade. The Hateful Eight would finally give me a chance to see her in a movie again. However, this movie is the Samuel L. Jackson show, with everyone else getting a small piece of the pie; there are so many cast members that each piece is relatively small. So JJL didn't get much to sink her teeth into. But hey, I love Samuel L. Jackson, too, so it still could have been great.\r Problem is...\r ...this movie has no point. It has no soul. It has no purpose. It has no emotional core. It has no theme. It has nothing but a kooky plot about scheming and killing that any 12 year old could make up during recess period. I mean, there is just nothing to this.\r And to top it off, it's way too long. When they showed one of the characters removing his gloves loosening one finger at a time before taking them off, I knew we were in for trouble. The exact same script could have been shot with a half hour or forty minutes less running time and it would not have felt rushed. This film as shot just feels so slow it's painful, especially the length of time before they get to the cabin where most of the movie takes place. This is one of the only movies I ever fell asleep in, and it was for about fifteen minutes during that opening phase when the stagecoach is heading for the cabin or store or haberdashery, whatever the place is.\r I do not recommend this movie, but if you must see it, rent it and fast forward when things get slow."
