There's distilled action, and then there's distilled action that has some redeeming twist that makes it great. You don't get that with this movie, you just get John Cena. There's a scene where he, his captured girlfriend, and the antagonist are all on a bus, and it turns out that the girl has a bomb strapped to her abdomen. First off, there were really no people on that bus -- in America -- who noticed that 3 people are talking about bombs and explosions on a freaking metropolitan BUS? And then really, if it did go off, would that be so wrong at that point?"

The plot is good with enough twists to keep everyone's interests. I have only one negative thing to say...and this is that I hate the type of camera work in this movie. It seems to be the latest rage in movies...to have jerky-action shots. Personally I think it looks amateurish and makes the watcher slightly nauseous. What a shame to do that to such an exciting film. Even with that type of photography, I would still recommend this film and have done so. I had never seen any advertising for this film and would not have gone to see it had I not looked up a synopsis of it."

Et franchement, ce n'est pas avec 12 Rounds (renomm\u00c3\u00a9 Shoot & Run) que le r\u00c3\u00a9alisateur va remonter la pente. Il en est m\u00c3\u00aame encore tr\u00c3\u00a8s loin, car ce film est d'une banalit\u00c3\u00a9, d'une invraisemblance et d'un manque de fond inimaginables. En somme, ce film n'est qu'une simple resuc\u00c3\u00a9e d'Une Journ\u00c3\u00a9e en Enfer (\u00c3\u00a0 croire que Harlin voulait faire son Die Hard 3) dont la mise en sc\u00c3\u00a8ne clipesque lorgne vers le cin\u00c3\u00a9ma de Tony Scott sans jamais l'\u00c3\u00a9galer (et sans compter la pauvret\u00c3\u00a9 du casting, du script et des dialogues). Bref, un v\u00c3\u00a9ritable \u00c3\u00a9chec. Alors pourquoi ne pas mettre une note plus basse? Juste par le fait que, finalement, on se laisse tout de m\u00c3\u00aame prendre au jeu pour passer le temps devant ce film \u00c3\u00a0 l'action non-stop abrutissant, qui ne vaut en rien les grands films d'action des 80's."
