The CoVid-19 is upon us and we should all wish we had nanotech inside of us to get rid of the virus. Needless to say, you're here for a review of Bloodshot and not more coronavirus warnings. Bloodshot features, the one, Vin Diesel as a top secret ops solider that was slain and re-animated by a company for their long awaited super soldier tech experiment. Sounds all too familiar in the world of comics. Vin stars alongside Eiza Gonzalez, as K.T., Guy Pearce, as Dr. Harting, and Lamorne Morris, as Wigans.Let's get this out of the way. No, the story isn't creative, profound or that interesting. BUT if you were going to the movie because of that, you must be sick with the Rona anyway. I think, however, should this movie make money through the pandemic, we definitely could see a sequel. The important and worth-seeing part of this movie is the technology and the action. First, this movie looks very good. The changing of scenes, brightness etc are so crisp. The nano-tech at times looks basic and almost too similar to another movie's bots. Second, the action sequences, even though I wanted a few more or longer sections in the first half of the movie, are all very cool. Vin, Eiza and others all have at least one awe-inspiring fight sequence worth watching. If anything towards the end of the movie, the CGI begins to fall apart and look too much like a video game compared to the previous scenes. On top of that, the final action scene is way more anti-climatic and underwhelming than built up to be.Speaking of Eiza, she really jumps off the screen. She presents a great mix of beauty and beast throughout the movie. In fact, her action sequences, to me, overshadowed Vin's best action sequences. In fact, Lamorne also steals the show from Vin. Lamorne's character, while a bit annoying and stereotypical hacker, was quite entertaining. Now that I think about it, every other character and actor displayed either more interesting, more authentic, or more dynamic acting ability than Vin. Vin is good at giving us Dom but he gave us robo-Dom in this movie and that's just not enough.Ultimately, Bloodshot is a dud of a movie but solid entertainment. As an introduction to a \"hero\", I'd honestly give the second movie a better shot at being much better than the first. For those of you that only care about the action, check this out in a matinee and you'll be fulfilled. Everyone else, this is one of those single popped popcorn kernel movies that you may enjoy on FX on a boring Saturday or Sunday afternoon."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Loved it!

The film is worth a look, at least once."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Because the decision was made to reveal Bloodshot's main story hook in the trailer all the movie really has to go on are its visuals as we basically know how everything is going to play out ahead of time. Luckily they are up to the task. First time director David Wilson had previously done a lot visual effects work for various video game related projects and even Age of Ultron. Everything looks absolutely fantastic and hyper-stylised as a result. Witnessing Vin Diesel have body parts blown off and reform in a cloud of nanites never gets old. A good thing too as this hero is entirely defined by his powers in this first outing.In a detrimental move the film is so focused on the action at hand that we never get to learn who Ray Garrison is as a person. As the intended starting point for a new cinematic universe, this shows a troubling lack of insight as to what led to the MCU's near instantaneous success. It wasn't the pre-existing popularity of the characters being adapted that captured everyone's enthusiasm, but rather the fact that we all felt like we got to know Iron Man when he first popped onto the scene back in 2008. So little was revealed about anyone in this movie that I don't even have a clue as to what they're plans for the rest of their lives looked like after they drove off into the sunset.Some goofs were made that will make it harder for people to connect with the world that's being established here going forward. Although, as someone completely unfamiliar with Valiant Comics this was a decent enough effort to pique my curiosity. These superheroes were clearly envisioned with unique ideas for powers and the content is far edgier than the majority of its contemporaries outside of Deadpool and maybe Harley Quinn (haven't seen that one yet). Some improvements will definitely need to be made in future installments should this universe be able get off the ground, but for all its faults it's the start of something new and that's pretty exciting."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Bloodshot is the latest attempt by a studio to potentially start another cinematic universe and in this case, the Valiant Comics cinematic universe. The film stars Vin Diesel as the titular character, Ray Garrison (didn't even remember his actual name), who is brought to life by an advanced technology that gives him the ability of superhuman strength and fast healing and with these abilities, he will go avenge his wife. However, He soon comes to learn that not everything he learns can be trusted.One positive thing I can say about this movie is that the concept itself is really interesting. The main character's ability is cool and the premise itself is intriguing enough even though the trailer spoils it. Anyway, that is it. I love Vin Diesel because he sounds like an amazing person in real life but my god he sucks in this movie. His delivery for what is meant to be an emotional scene is so laughably bad. For example, his wife dies in front of him and he shows little to no emotion and its just so hilarious. Most of his scenes are either him being quiet or just yelling all the time and it is just so bad. The plot is also dumb and butchers the premise by making it become a generic sci-fi action movie. The bad guys are obvious and the good guys are also obvious right from the get-go which makes any twist feel dull. Apart from the titular character, none of the character motivation seems to make any sense. Good guys helping the main character just because they are good guys and bad guys doing bad things just because. You never really understand why any of these characters are doing things. Additionally, there are just so many scenes of endless exposition that dragged and feel like info dumps just because they want to treat us, the audience, as if they are stupid or something. The action scenes are also edited with rapid cuts that are just annoying. There is also so much CGI in all these very noticeable action scenes. To be fair the action scenes are so dumb that they are kind of fun to watch. There is an action scene where a CGI Vin diesel, yes you heard that right, is punching someone in an elevator while they are falling is kinda amazing. For David S. F. Wilson directorial debut, he did a terrible job. One nitpick of a terrible film, there was a scene in London where it was clearly not London and that baffled me so much because why did they have to call it London? There was no reason for it...Overall, this movie is the dumbest movie I watched in ages. This is a movie that feels like it came out 20 years ago and honestly probably should have never been made. However, this movie is so bad that it is kind of entertaining. My recommendation is to watch it drunk or with friends/family just to tear into the movie because you want a bad movie. However, if you're looking for an interesting superhero movie then I can safely say this isn't it."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "This is basically Universal Soldier 2020.

The sad thing about this movie is that it is one of those movies that are so close to be being a good film but can't quite reach.There are several positivie parts in this. There are some clever or funny lines of dialogue. Undone's Siddharth Dhananjay is the standout in this as a comic relief coder.I give first time director Dave Wilson, who is a video game cinematics guy, does a pretty competent job cinematography/visuals-wise for his first live-action work. The whole thing looks great, except maybe for some CG effects that stand out too much. The villains' technology is well designed and thought out. Fight scenes work well; the first one in particular is really impressive.However, the plot never grabs you. I didn't feel involved in Bloodshot's journey or in anticipation for what happens. The script just wasn't interesting enough. For every line that works there is one that doesn't. The villain's plans feel undercooked. The most frustrating part is that Outlander's Sam Heughan's character's animosity toward Bloodshot feels so painfully forced and unnatural.I could see many people liking this more than me. Like I said, there are some good parts. Just have lowered expectations when going into this. I don't think this is bad, per se. It just doesn't leave a mark.
