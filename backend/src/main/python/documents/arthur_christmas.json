If you're looking for a lighthearted break from the holiday stress, get lost in this hilarious tale of Arthur, a child-at-heart dreamer who wants every child to experience the magic of Christmas. Well done. One of the few movies I'll actually buy when it's released on DVD. Merry Christmas!"

      "text": "The Aardman animators (best know for Wallace & Gromit) usually infuse their films with deadpan whimsy and eccentric personalities. This is an exception. The story takes place on Christmas night when Santa and his team have one last present to deliver. Leave it to the eponymous black-sheep son to come into his own and save the day. While the pacing is frantic and almost every frame is full of activity, the characters aren't especially unique and the writing isn't particularly clever. I really wanted to like it, but found it flat and lacking personality."

There really were no big laughs, but there are many small ones.  The most impressive thing about the film are the visuals, and the 3D is top notch as well.  The worse part of the film is that most, if not all of the characters have an English accent and my friends and I couldn't decipher some of the things they said.  I also noticed kids getting restless in the theater, so this might be hard for younger kids to follow.  Before the movie I had to suffer through a Justin Bieber video who is trying to be a cross between Justin Timberlake and Michael Jackson, but with a much worse voice."

The characters get on your nerves after a while and nothing much happens as everybody seems to beat about the bush blabbering endlessly. Though it starts off quite well and has some nice moments, by the time you're halfway through the film, the magic is really lost.I am quite certain that any kid in his right mind would not sit through this. And adults would be forced to cussing and tearing their hair, as the film rolls on and on, utterly lost in a maze of totally unnecessary subplots. If you're planning to entertain your family for Christmas, I'd recommend something else.Quite disappointed."

      "text": "The folks at Aardman Productions (Wallace & Gromit; Chicken Run) have done it again with this hilarious, cleverly written, dazzlingly animated Christmas charmer about Santa's two sons - muscle-bound technocrat Steve (Hugh Laurie) and mild-mannered dreamer Arthur (James McAvoy) - and how one of them (the title may give you a clue) saves Christmas for one little girl.  This may be one of the most visually thrilling 3-D movies ever made, but even in good old 2-D you'll have fun with the very funny screenplay by Peter Baynham and director Sarah Smith, as well as a fabulous cast of voice actors including standout turns by Jim Broadbent as Santa, Bill Nighy as patriarch Grandsanta, Imelda Staunton as Mrs. Claus, and Ashley Jensen as the plucky elf Bryony, who proves herself useful for far more than just wrapping gifts.  This one is a delight for all ages and sure to be a Yuletide favorite for years to come."

It may not be in the style of an Aardman film but it is still enjoyable. I hope Sony Pictures Animation appreciates Aardman because they are good studio. While this is may not feel like Aardman\u2019s other work it is still enjoyable and I will take this over Sony Pictures Animation\u2019s own films such as Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs any day. If you are looking for an enjoyable holiday film, a good animated film, or just sort of any enjoyable movie then definitely check this one out."

      "text": "Arthur Christmas does just what a really good Christmas film should - it keeps you absolutely glued to the screen and makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. It's expertly animated, slightly satirical, with strong morals and a great voice cast. While everyone gives their all in their vocal performances, of particular note are Hugh Laurie's efficient and coldly business-minded Steve Claus, Bill Nigh's ancient, senile and mischievous Grand Santa and Ashley Jensen's energetic and confident gift-wrapping elf Bryony. The story carries you along nicely, providing a fair amount of visual pizazz, action and humour along the way. Where Arthur Christmas really shines is in the festive message it promotes. The importance of unconditional family love is a common one in Yuletide movies, but somehow it comes across all the more effectively when the film's subjects, the Clauses are an undeniably dysfunctional, fantastic, yet strangely relatable family. Grand Santa is well past his sell-by date, but is not willing to give up the joys of life, or pass up an opportunity to show the younger generation how a job should be done. The current Santa (Jim Broadbent) is good-natured, but a little incompetent, and has never found the time to engage in any real way with his sons. Steve is desperate to do the best job possible and prove himself to be worthy of taking over the family business. Arthur, on the other hand, while inept, clumsy and generally being quite odd, is the only one in the family who seems to still understand, and truly care about the festive season, and what Father Christmas means to children all over the world. The real question is whether he's wise beyond his years or simply naive. The internal struggle within the family is essentially a battle between idealism (Arthur) and pragmatism (Grand Santa, Santa and Steve), and as a result, the film questions what modern Christmas is. Is it simply soulless commercialism, or is it something more? With these deep messages, as well as the simpler joys it provides, Arthur Christmas is certainly something special. It's just a lovely experience that will warm you to your very core, like a mince pie and a glass of mulled wine in front of the fire."

Arthur Christmas looks fantastic, its got a great voice cast, it's genuinely funny and it works as both a kids and a grown up film. The story is one of the people that work in the north pole. Its the tale of the clumsy Arthur (James McAvoy) who discovers that ,despite the well oiled nature of his families present delivering operation, a child has been missed. The rest of his family doesn't think it matters so Arthur heads out with the only two people on his side, his grandfather (Bill Nighy) and a wrapping department elf (Ashley Jensen). Because its a kids film they get into the usual highjinks but the film never loses itself with its message being one of optimism while maintaining the fast pace and quick wit with both visual and spoken gags being used to great effect. Its thoroughly enjoyable because it captures the spirit of the season while also making fun of it slightly. It gets you in the mood for the holidays and that's what its supposed to do."

The story is nice, meaningful and relatively heartwarming; which is always good for a Christmas film. Some of the jokes may fall a bit flat, but that's not really much to complain about, I haven't seen anything where some jokes don't. I recommend this film to anyone wanting a fun Christmas film."

It has this humble effort to simply tell a story on how important it is to make children happy and not sitting back in times someone gets left out. The voice talents are commendable especially voices for Grandsanta and Bryony. It would even deserve a \"voice ensemble\" nomination if such a category exist in the Annie. This movie will bring to life the child in you. movienotesbook.blogspot.com"

Was wanting a warm holiday film filled with nostalgia and familiarity. Instead it was a British film filled with unfamilir scenery, sometimes hard to understand accents (especially for my little one) all the elves had blackberries, and Santa drove a spaceship (not a spoiler b/c this is the first scene!)! Not what I think of when I think of Christmas. It also lacked substance and I was bored. I didn't even giggle once and my son didn't either. Skip this one. Wait next for next year when it comes out on cable! I did like that it was 3D."

There are scenes in this movie which revolve around wit and multiple viewings are highly recommended to try and get all the in jokes. This could be the next Christmas classic....its just so happy. It becomes a bit dull during the middle act and some jokes doesn't really work, but the ending much more than compensates to that."

Although there are some logical plot holes, the kids will surely miss them. Arthur has its moments and laughs. But the thing that bothers me the most is that when you near the end, it feels as though the writers slapped on material to progress the film. This is exemplified by Arthur, who \"discovers\" the moral of the story, even though he had been preaching it since the start."

      "text": "The lone Christmas movie of the year turns out to be one of the best made.  Though it may look overly silly Arthur Christmas has quite a lot of depth to it that many animated Christmas movies never come close to achieving.  The movie takes us into the world of the Clause family where the role of Santa is passed down from generation to generation.  When Santa fails to deliver one present to one little girl, Santa's son Arthur sets out to deliver the present with his old and rather looney grandfather, the former Santa.  The 3D effect used here is amazing and it helps to immerse the viewer in magical worlds of flying animals and winter wonderlands.  Its well worth the surcharge in my opinion.  The voice acting is spot on as well lead by James McAvoy as Arthur.  However what truly makes this film wonderful is its charm and its wit, and there is plenty of it."

      "text": "The problem with christmas movies nowadays, atleast for me anyway, is that they never seem to properly capture the spirit of christmas. Thankfully, Arthur Christmas succeeds in doing that. This is a very fun and enjoyable adventure with a funny script and some great comedic timing. It also addresses how christmas isn't like how it used it be. With lots of companies milking up the holidays, it isn't about the family or the spirit anymore, and this movie addresses that in such a hilarious way. The Santa in this movie is not like the Santa that you remember. He doesn't really do that much, instead he has hundreds of elves that enter the houses simultaneously and just drop everything off, and he is just the face of the company. Meanwhile, we have Grandsanta, who complains that his son has gone too commercial. He was by far the funniest character in the movie. Arthur is the protagonist, and is Santa's son. He is such a caring person with an optimistic attitude that did get annoying at times, but overall he is a great character that makes you want to pat him on the back. Steve is Arthurs brother who is the likely replacement of Santa, but i thought his character was rather pointless to be honest, and i didn't really care about him. There is a moment where i thought the film dragged just a little bit, however the last fifteen minutes of this movie make up for that as they're very intense. Overall, Arthurs Christmas is a great movie not just for kids, but also adults. It succeeds in capturing the christmas spirit, and i'm going to give it an 8/10."
