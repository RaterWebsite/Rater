The non-linear story is very deep and can be easily missed if taken at face value."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This movie is a bold expose of the Satanic secret societies of the uber-wealthy in the United States. To find out the story behind this movie, start researching; bohemian grove, bilderberg group, house of rothschild, Skull & Bones, freemasons.\rTo give you an example of how exclusive these Satanic societies are, just remember that in the movie, Harford was an M.D. and even he was nowhere near the level of these others. Poolroom scene: Victor: \"I couldn't even BEGIN to figure out how you had ever even HEARD of us.., let alone have the password...\"\rThe scenes depicted and described by Kubick are very real. The \"security measures\" and protocols are much more strict than suggested when one female member is apparently killed in compensation for Harford's intrusion, but the scene made for good theatre. Of course, an \"outsider\", like Nick, would never have been allowed anywhere near one of these groups, but again, it was a clever theatrical portal into the activities of the group.\rAfter Harford walks through the halls and rooms of the mansion, he is commanded to \"...never tell anyone what he has seen\". This suggests something very illegal and very taboo. Here, we are talking about the pedophilic Satanic underground of the Zionist-controlled, globalist, multi-national corporation heads: Pool room scene: Victor:  \"If you knew their names, and I'm not going to give you their names, you wouldn't sleep very well at night...\" These activities also involve breeding, slavery, human trafficking and human sacrifice.\rKubric was probably well-aware that he was stepping on some toes by writing, producing and directing this film. Those types of groups alluded to in the film were probably quite aware of the project before its completing, as well, because much of the entertainment industry is owned by large, multi-national corporations. The scene(s) at the costume-fitters shop (with the under-age female being prostituted) were a deft allusion to what Hanford saw on his walking tour of the mansion.\rA bold and important film, and one that Kubrick may have lost his life over: he died of a \"heart attack\"  after showing the final-cut movie once: To the main actors at a private exhibition.\rPersonally, I think Cruise's (and Kidman's) acting was perfect. Hanford's integrity, moderation and logic was a cool counterpoint to the thick and ominous intrigue that increasingly threatened him and his world."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Stanley is a genius.\rEye's wide shut is a centerpiece for many, script wise and cinematography wise.\rIn order to extract all the gold from this meditation, one has to be patient, one must be a true lover of\rcinema.

I just had to come here and, I see, finally (over 2 years after joining) post my first review in order to mention it - it's such a great read-perhaps better than the movie itself.\r It's pretty awesome to see how a thorough analysis makes such a mockery of the run-of-the-mill reviewer's reviews - those from the New York times and Washington Post.\r The movie is chock full of masterful iconography.  While I missed little of the visual symbology, such as the use of spaciousness, and evil symbology, I didn't pick up on most of the linguistic symbols, from witty names like that of the profligate \"Doctor Bill\" and ruling class \"Victor\" to the commercial signage.\r The greatest strength of the film is the social criticism angle - like 'Pig Hunt', which I played a tiny part in producing.  It lays bare an exquisite panorama of crassness and wretchedness, like pig adorned in diamonds and pearls.\r Somehow, the acting was believable and I was drawn into the movie, even as the characters came across as the flattened sterotypes that Kubrick clearly wanted."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "El director de solo obras maestras se sali\u00c3\u00b3 con la suya de nuevo.

Critics panned what they couldn't understand - a movie, subtly and ingeniously directed, reflecting the lifestyle of the rich and famous, and the influence of paganism in contemporary society, through the worship of Satan. The nudity in the movie emphasises the immorality and depravity that exists among the rich and famous.Personally, I wouldn\u2019t class this as an erotic movie, it has adult content and lots of nudity but it\u2019s more about controlling desires, sexuality and trust rather than eroticism. Starting off in a warm fuzzy this creates a dreamy, affluent and seemingly carefree world where the background colours reflect the current plot mode, green for jealousy etc, as the story unfolds.

But, alas, as a film, it fails. The problem is not solely due to the awkward performances by Cruise and Kidman, but actually due to Kubrick's own direction. While a master of mis-en-scene, atmosphere, and visuals, Kubrick has always been an emotionally distant director. This is probably due to Kubrick's own personality, but his misanthropic tendencies work in films like Dr. Strangelove, A Clockwork Orange, and Paths of Glory, due to his understanding of craft and touch for cold feeling that isolates the viewer when it is supposed to. He is emotionally distant in a good way, like a Radiohead song. But while Kubrick's tactics of isolation worked in films with cold feelings and misanthropy, it fails in Eyes Wide Shut. The film is supposed to be about the inner-workings of the human brain, and specifically, the part that can bring out intense emotions. The problem is Kubrick seems so disinterested in his own characters, as well as Cruise and Kidman, that to connect emotionally, which a character study needs, fails.

His work is immense where his directing style and cinematography can entertain viewers who have seen the beautiful filmmaking and what he was going for. As far as I love Stanley Kubrick as a director, this is one of the raunchiest. Much like how A Clockwork Orange shocked people in the theatre worldwide and how controversial is was, this movie went on a whole new level when there is amount of sex in this, I will tell you how. Tom Cruise is Dr. William Harford is on his sexually natured adventures when he is shocked when his wife, Alice played by Nicole Kidman, reveals that she had contemplated having an affair a year earlier. So he went out on his night-long adventures including the only place and the only scene which I will never forget. He who witnessed a weird bizarre masked quasireligious orgiastic ritual at a country mansion, a discovery which would later threaten his life. And that is the long scene which I'll never forget and it will be embarrassing. Take a wild guess? \"Masked orgies\". This movie is something that people don't really understand but if they actually did, newcomers who are interested like me may know what to expect and thinking about what was going on at what Bill went through. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are both good in this and they played good characters at what they're going through on their sexual relationship. They both got married and they starred at Days of Thunder and Far and Away and now they're divorced. The only thing I almost forgot to mention is that the film is slow-paced because the way it was slow-paced, the more the scenes are long to go on for, cause the film does sometimes have some long shots and they do those scenes really well. Much like that I've seen A Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket and I love the hell out of them and Eyes Wide Shut is a very underrated drama film filled with erotic scenes, slow-paced scenes, thrills and mystery. Stanley Kubrick did a tremendous job making this film and it will be fondly remembered by anyone who is a fan of his work. And may the greatest director of all time rest in peace for he had experienced of making his last film which is impressively great, Eyes Wide Shut."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "\u201cEyes Wide Shut\u201d may have trouble living up to all the extreme and diverse expectations viewers may have for it, as almost any picture would under the circumstances. But after all the curiosity and attendant hype wash away, what one is left with is a riveting, thematically probing, richly atmospheric and just occasionally troublesome work, a deeply inquisitive consideration of the extent of trust and mutual knowledge possible between a man and a woman. Meticulous, deliberate and precise picture casts a particular sort of spell, one that will likely captivate older and thoughtful audiences more than it will mainstream Tom Cruise die-hards and those with short attention spans.\r Less acerbic and, in its own tentative way, more optimistic about the human condition than any of the director\u2019s previous films, this intimately focused updating by Kubrick and Frederic Raphael of Arthur Schnitzler\u2019s beautifully observed 1926 novella \u201cDream Story\u201d remains remarkably faithful to its source while also trading in familiar Kubrick concerns such as paranoia, deception, the literal and figurative masks people wear, and the difficulty for even intelligent human beings to transcend the base and self-destructive impulses that drive the species. Aside from its succession of delectable individual scenes, pic\u2019s outstanding feature is its subtle and unstressed expression of a dreamlike state, a stylistic fusion of the gritty and the fanciful that allows for \u201creality\u201d and the imaginary to merge to such an extent that it is of no concern which is which, if indeed they are distinct.\r Kubrick first considered adapting Schnitzler\u2019s Freudian, Vienna-set tale in the late \u201960s, and in its sense of intellectual adventurousness and daring, as well as for its vaguely disembodied, out-of-real-space-and-time feel, pic seems rather more like a part of that era than of today\u2019s cinema. Longtime Kubrick fans will therefore no doubt pick up on many nuances and meanings that could easily elude the masses of contempo viewers who are too young to have seen a Kubrick picture first-run in a theater.\r Even though \u201cEyes Wide Shut,\u201d like its source story, is seen from the male p.o.v. and largely concerns the obsessions, fears and limitations of its protagonist, pic is unique in the late director\u2019s oeuvre in that it\u2019s the women who far outshine the men. Kidman is sensational and luminous as she inhabits her character, who reps a convincing argument for the view that women are far more cognizant and expressive of their emotions than are men. When absent from the story during her husband\u2019s wanderings, numerous other actresses willingly take up the slack in a succession of brief but indelible turns, most notably the intense Richardson as the bereaved neurotic daughter, the insinuating Shaw as the inviting prostie and Fay Masterson as the latter\u2019s upfront roommate.\r Where this leaves Cruise is the film\u2019s most debatable issue. At face value, the star gives a limited, emotionally constrained, eyebrow-crinkling and grimacing performance, nor is he entirely convincing as an established favorite doctor to Gotham\u2019s elite. No doubt the same complaints that were voiced about the ineffectuality of Ryan O\u2019Neal in \u201cBarry Lyndon\u201d will be heard here about Cruise. On the other hand, it can be argued that the actor, who has none of the big thesping demands placed upon him that the women do, despite being onscreen nearly continuously, generously hands the picture over to his several outstanding female partners by allowing them to shine. While the role could have used an actor whose casual authority cloaked inner turmoil and desire, Kubrick found a way to use Cruise shrewdly, and thesp in no way impedes the picture from the full expression of its intentions and meanings.\r As for the titillation factor, some of the dialogue is far more explicit than what\u2019s on view. Kidman has much more action with her dream officer in her husband\u2019s mind via black-and-white fantasy footage than she ever does with her mate. Orgy sequence features plenty of stunning nude women striding around as well as pretty standard soft-core simulations.\r And so the career of a great filmmaker comes to a close with a work that, while not his most startling or innovative or subversive, nonetheless sees him striking out in exciting and sometimes new directions with his stylistic confidence and boldness intact. Given that the endings to his previous films have been variously absurdist, despairing, apocalyptic, mystical, corrosive, murderous and nihilistic, perhaps the fact that the conclusion here is at least guardedly hopeful suggests that, at the end, Kubrick believed in some sort of human progress after all."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Eyes Wide Shut is the last film of the great Stanley Kubrick and perhaps the most controversial in his filmography.
