Generic and predictable storyline that has some pretty severe pacing problems in filling out its runtime and lots of name-recognized actors who do not get used to their full potential.  But the end result isn't terrible, just mediocre.  A few of the gags did get laughs, but on the whole it's a January theater space occupier release that accomplishes just that."

The animation was ok the story was well paced but weak and generic over all. The main character was a bit too much of an a$% but not so that he was unlikeable. The side characters were fun and enough to balance out his negativity the notable ones are buddy as a faithful sidekick and precious who\u2019s dynamic with the main character and personality had me laughing more than once. The main antagonist was bland but not distractingly so. All in all the movie is pretty bland with few weaknesses but takes no risks."

Yes it's not up to the quality of a Pixar or DreamWorks animated movie, but I do not believe in will make older audiences miserable.\r The movie has got a great voice cast full of some big name actors. The animation is pretty bad though, as the human characters and backgrounds just look gross. The animals actually look pretty good, but it's often hard to notice that given how ugly the world around them is. As far as humor and story goes, both are up to snuff and are entertaining enough to keep you engaged, even if neither are particularly revolutionary. I do feel it can be surprisingly violent though, and not in a slapstick sort of way. It can almost seem mean at times.\r All in all it's a decent animated kids movie that I do not feel will make viewers miserable in any way. Kids are most likely going to get quite a few laughs out of it, and adults shouldn't have to worry about staying awake through it. My final score is a 6.3/10=Okay."

      "text": "The Nut Job actually got a theatrical release. The film is of poor quality making it questionable why it wasn\u2019t released straight to DVD. The Nut Job is plagued by the typical problems children\u2019s films face such as two-dimensional characters, bad jokes, and a unoriginal story. The writers half-ass that department as expected but unlike some films which have decent/really good animation to make up for it (ex. The Lorax, Free Birds) the animation is awful. This film isn\u2019t Foodfight level of bad as nothing in here is offensive or obnoxious and young children may be mildly entertained by the film but is upsetting to see a studio release something in theaters without putting any effort into it. The film is of such low quality that it doesn\u2019t deserve a theatrical release and should\u2019ve gone straight to DVD where most low quality films are sent. Even then its not something that is worth sitting through. I feel bad for all the parents who had to sit through this film and shudder at the thought that this film is getting a sequel."

These squirrels must fight against this one self-serving squirrel for their only hope of surviving the winter, however things go not as planned. The movie is surprisingly entertaining, funny and heart warming at parts, I did not watch the movie in 3D but I guess it would've been good since animated movies are known for eye popping 3D. However, this movie obviously should have been straight to video,with poor animation I can recall a video game with better graphics that this movie has, it is that type of movie that recycles everything more known and more successful animated movies created and imagined. The characters are either greedy or evil, literally. The one character that could had a chance of being noticeable character missed the shot. The Nut Job is short and just straight to the point. Creating brief history for each card board character that you nearly connect with. Even the positive message doesn't even save this movie, because lessons such not being greedy or self serving are presented in other better animated movies in which you can care for the character. Now despite being surprisingly entertaining it is plain predictable and very easy to forget, children should have a good time but overall I can not recommend The Nut Job. If you are really interested in seeing this movie, rent it, you'll have fun but don't expect much."

      "text": "\"The Nut Job\" 10 Scale Rating: 3.5 (Bad) ...\r The Good: The story itself isn't too bad and the potential was there. Will Arnett and Liam Neeson were excellent, especially Neeson. I usually dislike voice actors who stand out so much that it is obvious who they are, but Neeson fit.\r The Bad: For starters, the animation simply isn't very good. It would have been considered sate of the art maybe a decade ago, but here in 2014 this seemed like a lazy effort. Despite a decent story there isn't much humor, heart, or many great moments in the film. The movie relies almost solely on poor slapstick and completely misses the mark. Brendan Fraser's character was especially annoying and I was relieved when he disappeared for awhile."

      "text": "Park creatures are the focus of this animal based adventure, well park creatures and some woodland creatures it seems. So its kinda like 'Over the Hedge' but just nowhere near as good or funny. For some unknown reason the movie is set in 1959 although I had no clue to this whilst watching, I just thought it was the artistic style for quirkiness. All these little mammals live in or near a big tree within a park, winter is coming and they gotta collect nuts to survive. I kinda always thought that was a squirrel thing but in this movie raccoon's moles birds etc...all seem to want nuts too.\r Believe it or not that's pretty much the entire premise, creatures after nuts. The gimmick being after accidentally burning down the big tree whilst trying to nab nuts, Surly Squirrel is outcast into the city to survive as punishment. There he discovers a basement full of nuts but the basement is also the HQ for some bank robbers who are attempting their own heist. Hence the movie being called the Nut Job because it deals with a bank job and a similar job for the creatures trying to nab these nuts...such a clever play on the 'Italian Job' movie...oh geez...face in palms cringe time. Oh and I guess Surly Squirrel is caused this down to the fact he's miserable mean and selfish right? (*groan*).\r OK the movie looks good of course, I can't fault that but its hardly a surprise is it. Everything is animated beautifully and looks glossy. All the characters are well designed, they all look as they should (cartoony versions of animals) and the voice acting work is solid. The nameless raccoon character looks to have been designed around Liam Neeson's face as they both have similar facial expressions and a big conk which work well. Various other characters are as you'd expect with the stereotypical dumb clumsy characters, fat ugly characters, tough large characters and the one main attractive female character (attractive on an animal level).\r Most of these characters are all reasonable enough accept for Grayson Squirrel who is the park hero...but is actually very incompetent and cowardly (you're suppose to laugh now...this is the funny character). This guy is annoying and pretty pointless really, he serves no real purpose and could be easily hacked out of the movie. Naturally Brendan Fraser voices this highly annoying and pointless squirrel and we've seen this act before from Fraser.\r One problem with this movie is there are too many character I think, you're never really sure if you actually like any of them because most of them are so fundamentally unlikable and boring. Well that and incredibly clich\u00e9d predictable and stereotypical of every animal animated movie ever! The plot is so utterly drab and it goes nowhere! they wanna steal nuts, OK so steal them, what's the big deal. The stupid thing is they're animals...they could probably grab nuts and all sorts from anywhere in a city and in the end they don't actually manage to get them anyway! Half of them got flushed away in the river and can you count wet soggy nuts a score? The actual bank heist sub-plot going on with the humans just seemed so redundant, who cares? I didn't. It didn't really bare any influence or relevance on the animal plot going on around their feet.\r Christ this movie was dull! I mean seriously I was getting up and doing other things. The plot is so slow, so dull, so unadventurous. The characters are so basic, so flat, so completely lifeless and clich\u00e9d its painful, the fact the movie tries to be funny also sticks out like a sore thumb and bombs hard. Grayson Squirrel is clearly meant to be the pant wettingly funny aspect of the movie and he sucks ass! whilst the main hero squirrel Surly is just depressing. Oh and Hollywood people...its kinda creepy animating these cutesy creatures with human expressions and body movements.\r What was that soundtrack about?! I'm guessing the use of horrendous 'Gangnam Style' track is down to the fact the movie was co-produced in South Korea. Was that really necessary? oh and was it remotely necessary to have an animated PSY in the end credits doing that stupid dance with all the animals!! Good God that was terrible, switched that sh*t off quicker than you can say that song will date this movie badly in years to come."
