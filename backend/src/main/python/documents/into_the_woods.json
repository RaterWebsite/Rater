      "text": "This is one of the most captivating and affecting film adaptations of a stage musical I've seen! As a word of caution, do NOT presume that because the plot is based upon \"interwoven fairy tales\" this is intended to be a feel-good kids' movie. Acquaint yourself with the (excellent) 3-hour Sondheim musical and you'll soon realize that the aim of this story is to explore what occurs *beyond* the happy endings. The events of the second half are dark, yes; but the overall message is hopeful (listen to the words of the movie's final two songs). Certain changes and omissions were necessary to get the film version down to a palatable running length, and huge fans of the stage musical may be put off by some of these. Personally, though, I feel that they were appropriate given the totally different demands of each medium. I was blown away by the performances and the amazing vocal talents of the cast as a whole. The actors pulled off those notoriously intricate Sondheim arrangements beautifully -- and there are many moments of humor to lighten the mood. In particular, Chris Pine as the \"charming-not-sincere\" prince gave an especially funny, tongue-in-cheek performance. This movie is a reflection of life itself with a magical fairy tale twist: colorful, touching, energetic, humorous, sad, ultimately uplifting and so very, very well done."

Giving the story book characters a bit of a twist from the original story. The movie was definitely not what I had expected. I am surprised by the director's and the writer's creative integrity in the original story, but I being a favorite of the original story I prefer the original story over this one. The characters acting wasn't bad. It shows not oly the good in the character but also a darker side to them. The prince being self-centered and the other characters having a darker and self-centered side was a huge twist in the story. I honestly liked the story being original but didn't like the ending or the way the characters were written. Storybook characters are written to inspire people to do the impossible and over come all odds but the whole prince cheating on Cinderella thing wasn't something that should be taught to younger kids. Overall I give the movie a 5. The story is original, bland, and changes the original story completely."

      "text": "In December 1987, I saw Into the Woods on Broadway with Bernadette Peters. The musical had just opened the month before, and it was charming, original, and entertaining. Translating the musical and stage format to the screen expands the spatial representation to the world of reality, or pseudo-reality, given that the story is a fairy tale, and that expansion is problematic for it dilutes the concentrated power of the original format.\r The most innovative aspect of the original effort was the clever intertwining of  several prominent fairy tales from the Brothers Grimm. A baker (James Corden) and his young wife (Emily Blunt), who cannot conceive, live next door to a nasty, old lady (Meryl Streep), who looks exactly like a witch and turns out to be a real one\u2014she has a vegetable garden that grows magic beans, and she cursed the couple long ago when the baker\u2019s father stole some of the beans from her. In order to lift the curse, the couple has to provide the witch with a milky-white cow, a golden slipper, a red cape, and corn-yellow hair in three days before midnight. In the meantime, the old witch visits her adopted daughter, who has very long hair and lives in a tower. That would be Rapunzel (Mackenzie Mauzy). The magic beans, of course, grow a giant stalk that is climbed by a young boy named Jack (Daniel Huttlestone), and the kingdom is ruled by a handsome prince (Chris Pine) who is seeking a wife and who meets a young woman named Cinderella (Anna Kendrick) at the ball. The woods of the small kingdom contain wolves and a hut occupied by a grandmother\u2014a little girl visits granny wearing a red cape with a hood (Lilla Crawford).\r As per the original story, there are dilemmas and scenarios that would have shocked the Grimm Brothers. For example, the baker\u2019s wife has a one-night stand with Prince Charming, and that takes place after he has had his happily-ever-after wedding with Cinderella. And Cinderella is very frustrated about life with the prince because everything is too perfect. The witch is actually just an overprotective mother who can\u2019t accept that her daughter\u2019s childhood has ended. They all come together in the last act  to fight a common foe, which is a giant who has descended by way of the stalk and wants revenge upon little Jack for stealing from her and accidentally killing her husband.\r Live theatre creates its own microcosmic reality; thus, the stage version is not as jarring when the characters are constantly breaking out into song. Generally speaking, in a musical stage production the singing is well integrated. On film, the integration of the singing has to be more nuanced, and it is very difficult to achieve just the right timing in a film setting that appears to occupy a realistic landscape. There is a constant air of \u201cI feel a song coming on...\u201d that can weary the audience.\r Streep makes for a good witch, albeit maybe a bit too exaggerated if one is to believe she is also a loving mother. Blunt has the strongest role as the baker\u2019s wife. All the actors seem to be desperately seeking their character, including Anna Kendrick as a petite, brunette Cinderella, a description which doesn\u2019t quite fit the profile. (Blunt\u2019s plaintive line, \u201cI\u2019m in the wrong story,\u201d strikes a chord in more ways than one.) The two princes, Cinderella\u2019s prince and Rapunzel\u2019s prince (Billy Magnussen) are as handsome as princes can be, but they are overly fickle and shallow. If the reasons behind their fickleness are complex, that complexity is never explored. And the film is overly long.\r Although the visual representation of the fairy-tale kingdom is brilliantly magical, if not positively supernatural, it is not clear that this is the fairy-tale version that the children want to see. The Broadway version was more openly cynical, and it was also strictly for grown-ups."

None were particularly memorable except for the humorous song with the princes. It was way too long of a movie. The last half hour of the movie was terrible (after the wedding). It consisted of things happening with no reason or explanation, no emotion shown by any of the characters, a BS line of morality drawn by multiple characters about how decisions don't matter and there is no wrong or right. That is a dangerous message to send to kids in my humble opinion. I am fine with no happy ending but this movie creates an unhappy reason simply just to say it did and that happy endings don't exist. Meanwhile, the acting was stale and boring. James Marsden was the closest to a decent character. The rest simply lacked a soul. I have no clue how this movie has so many positive reviews. A brilliant musical is Les Mis, this on the other hand was forgettable drivel."

However, I am going to have to negate most of the posts praising the cast for good acting.  I do not think it is necessarily her fault (I blame the director), but Lilla Crawford as Little Red Riding Hood was unbearable to watch.  She appeared as a soulless singing robot - like a jukebox with legs.  Then again, so did many of the characters.  Meryl Streep's performance was missing something.  I have seen community theatre performances with a more lively and captivating witch.  That being said, the movie missed the opportunity to make Prince Charming and the Wolf the same person, which I have seen a number of times on stage, which adds a layer of complexity.  Instead they threw a dumptruck full of money at Johnny Depp for a three minute scene prominently featured in the preview to get unsuspecting movie goers into the chairs.  James Corden was by far the most interesting person to watch in this movie and Tracy Ullman as Jack's Mother was fun.  If you have seen Into the Woods on stage, you will be disappointed.  If you are not a die hard fan of musicals, you will be disappointed.  If you ARE a die hard fan of musicals, but somehow missed Into the Woods, you will still be disappointed.  Go watch a bunch of nobodies do this on stage, and I can almost guarantee it will be more captivating."

First if you are going to destroy our childhood fairy tales, make it for an adult audience with good sarcasm, not super cheesy comedy that was so random it was confusing. It was like the directors/producers were mocking themselves! This movie sucks let's make fun of it! The songs were soooooooooo long I had to close my eyes at times. I don't know why they have to bring a British accent to make it more appealing, but yeah even that got annoying. The end was terrible, it dragged on forever. I saw a person looking at their cell to see when it was over as I was too. They really ruined a great opportunity to make a great movie because again the effects and the woods are incredible, but the plot super boring. Good singing but again not even the angelical voices can make me watch this one more time!"

      "text": "As a preface to my analysis I would like to say: if you are a parent looking for a good family film that you'll all enjoy, take caution before going to see \"Into the Woods.\" It's not that there's anything particularly inappropriate, but rather that  \"Woods\" is a complex musical for adults. This is why the \"Junior\" version of the stage musical (intended for younger audiences) ends after the first act. I believe it is pretty deceptive how they've marketed this film. Unless you have some pretty smart kids, do them a favor and  save it for them for when they're older.\r The film version of this staple of American theatre is a bit of a mixed bag. The first \"act\" of the movie is handled with pretty seamless precision (the only exception being my personal distaste for the direction they take the Wolf in). The performers are outstanding (Emily Blunt and James Corden are really special as the Baker and his Wife), the cinematography is beautiful, and the vocals are palpable.\r Unfortunately, the second half manages to be unsatisfactory for most, for completely different reasons. Those seeking a light, easily digestible fairy tale will feel put off by the dark turn the second half takes. On the flip side, purists of the musical will be frustrated by some pretty glaring omissions (notably \"No More\" and the extreme truncation of the first reprise of \"Children will Listen\") that water down the dramatic impact of the movie.\r If you're interested in being intellectually challenged and you aren't a fan of the stage musical, \"Into the Woods\" is certainly worth watching. If you aren't, this probably isn't a movie for you. If you're a fan of the musical, prepare for some frustrating changes. However, it's still worth watching, if for no other reason than seeing Chris Pine and Billy Magnussen do \"Agony.\" Seriously. It's that good."

Characters clash with their personalities, betray their beliefs, and die. The second act moves slow and feels like a whole different film.

I also have always liked the song \"Children Will Listen\", especially the version Barbra Streisand does on one of her CDs.  The rest of the songs, however, were not very catchy or memorable, and that is the one issue I had with the film.  Some of these songs might translate better live on a stage.  Chris Pine was also a standout for me, and he has an excellent singing voice.  I like Emily Blunt in everything she does.  The few children that were in the theater were antsy and fidgety, although there were moments when they were quiet and paid attention, particularly when Meryl Streep was on the screen.

The blending of the stories was great, the acting was amazing but the music does start to pain your ears after a while.  I would only recommend this movie to older Disney fans or (of course) fans of the on stage version, because that is exactly what you are getting."

It was almost a parody at times, they didn't seem to be taking themselves too seriously, so it was funny. Not laughing out loud funny but it put a smile on my face.\r There is a wonderful combination of all the famous fairy-tales in one story. They've incorporated the drama, the comedy of these tales, and obviously added a music into the new story. They've humanized our fairy tales characters, adding a little more edge to them, making the story is somewhat interesting but not enough for me to be invested in it.\r Although the singing was good - I'm talking quality here - I wasn't\rblown away by the songs, I didn't once want to sing along and I can't remember a particular song I like, except maybe the Merryl Streep one from the trailer.\r It's a nice ensemble of a cast, they've picked the right people for the right roles. Depp is right in his wheelhouse but he's not on long enough to be annoying. Streep struggled to get me on board with her character but by the end I was in. James Corden & Emily Blunt are a lovely pair, they were great together and Blunt really impressed me - mostly because her and musicals, I mean singing, didn't ring true - she was good and really stood out for me. One last thing about the cast, I liked Pines in the movie ONLY because he delivered my favorite quote from the film \"I was praised to be charming, not sincere.\"\r @wornoutspines"

People where already predicting the categories for the movie even when their haven't even seen it yet. Everybody wouldn't shut up about this movie and when the reviews came out for this movie it was a bit mix for some but still good through, but not has good as people thought it was going to be.\r Into the Woods for me was a okay movie. This isn't in anywhere near has good as Les Miserables. But the movie was way over hyped by a lot of people and this is what happens when you over hype things, it will lead to disappointment.\r This movie has a pretty big cast and some of them do really good and I have to say that all the actors in this movie sing really well. Nobody did a crap job of singing. Nobody did the Russell Crowe of singing, no they all do fantastic singing.\r Meryl Streep to me stole the show. That was just something about her character in this movie that just stood out to me and I just loved her body moment and the tone on her voice that was just spot on with her character. I may have made jokes about Mery being a Oscar magnet, but she really is a flawless actress that I always knocks my socks off every time I seen her.\r For problems and I have a lot: Johnny Depp is in this movie and you probably think his just playing a goofy and weirdo that Depp always is, but no in this movie he comes off a bit creepy and really unsettling or and Depp pretty much plays Depp and nothing special. I know this is base on a popular on the Broadway show but I can't help to say that the sets in this movie looks like it's a Broadway play more then a full feature film. The movie is way too long, because I thought the film was rapping up on a good note but the film kept going and going and good god it went on for every.\r Overall Into the Woods is for people who love musicals or Broadway. But for me movies like this isn't my kind of thing but I always watch them to see if it dose surprise me or not, and this movie is just okay."

Couldn't understand the strange twist on the storyline in the last 30 min, everything collapse, I just wanted this to end and go to sleep."

      "text": "Absolutely fantastic!! I believe that Into the Woods gave actors like Meryl Street the opportunity to shine, while not in an overwhelming way. What I mean by this is that her role, gave way for other actors to be noticed, such as little red riding hood, or jack. At the same time, it added to the repertoire of budding actors like Anna Kendrick, and the fabulous James Corden"
