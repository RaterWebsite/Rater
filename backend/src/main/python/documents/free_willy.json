      "rating": "4",
      "text": "As bland as nineties rip-offs of E.T. could get, Free Willy copies that classic down to the smallest detail, but the bond is never felt between the boy and the whale, instead coming across as assembly mind fodder."

    {
      "rating": "9",
      "text": "I must say, Free Willy is one of the best films ever made! The relationship between a boy(Jason James Richter) and a whale named Willy remains strong through hard times. Sadly, Jason James Richter then starred in The Neverending Story III(one of the worst films ever made) and now it's hard for me to believe that he was in a good movie."
