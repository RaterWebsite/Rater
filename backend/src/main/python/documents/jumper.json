The nerd community hates on Hayden Christensen so, with this movie being more in the sci-fi/fantasy genre, it really didn't stand a chance. However, he's a capable actor and the support of Samuel Jackson, Rachel Bilson, Jamie Bell, and other cameos gave this movie a solid cast. As I said, the plot was pretty interesting and original as well. The only real problem I had with the film is that it was only 88 minutes, which didn't really give it time to fully develop the concept of \"jumping\" and the relationship because them and the Paladins, an organization that hunts down jumpers. With more development I think this would've been a great movie."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Jumper is a good sci-fi/action movie.I agreed the acting is not that good and the scenario is bad but the CGI effects are good and there is a good cast (Hayden Christensen,Jamie Bell,Samuel L.

In short conclusion, Jumper jumps to get early start when you should know early starts make movies look bad."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "I thought this was fairly entertaining fare and I liked the special effects, they were about what you would expect in this modern age, so that didn't let me down, however I felt that the story did. I liked the character of Millie but the main character of David, ie the main character the movie is all about, well, it just seemed flawed to me. I didn't feel as if I had any particular interest in this person, somehow. When he stole from the bank, as much as I suppose a part of me would think it would be cool to be able to do such a thing, I can't say I felt that I was hoping he wouldn't be caught or that I was overly excited for his situation. I think he seemed a bit too cocky perhaps but there was definitely something missing which made the movie just not work as well as I think it could have.The special effects were good but I also feel that more of it could have been used and overall I was left feeling that it had better potential. The story itself seemed like one that had been done quite a number of times before and it just didn't really (get the joke) jump out at me. One tell tale sign is that this morning, after having watched it the night before, I couldn't remember exactly how it ended and I'd forgotten a fair bit about it which just proves that at least for me, it was quite unmemorable. I have to say though, the concept behind it is one that I liked, I always had a big imagination as a child and I like the thought of being able to teleport and go from one part of the world to another straight away, I think that perhaps if they changed the main character and if the story was just a bit more detailed or 'meatier' which is the word that comes to mind, if you know what I mean!, then it could have been alot better. I'm aware that this movie is based on a set of comic books and that in that respect, the story presumably had to stay true to the original comics, so it didn't have too much scope for change and I haven't read the original comics, I can only judge the movie on the movie alone.On the more positive side, I thought that Samuel L Jackson was a good choice of actor for playing the villain Roland, as formulaic as that was he does have a bit of an 'other worldly' type look about him, especially with his dyed white hair and I also liked some of the shots of Italy and of course of the Colosseum. There are some nice camera angles and lighting used and it would have looked good on the big screen I can imagine. Also I liked seeing Jamie Bell (who played the lead role in Billy Elliot) in this, he portrayed his character of Griffin quite well, I thought given the type of character he was (as this fast and energetic guy), he looked the part."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I think the movie was quite enjoyable. What I sometimes do not understand are the casting choices. There was a chick he picked up in a bar in London, she should have played the main female character. A hundred times more attractive and hot than that small ugly chick they finally selected. Special effects were great, I did not feel the need to zap away or take a nap once, and that says a lot !"}, {"rating": "1", "text": "Jumper is by far one of the worst movies i've ever seen, the story is crap, and the characters are unlikable (but what did you expect when the main character is the guy who ruined Star Wars), it's ultimately a really unenjoyable movie."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Jumper is the first film from a trilogy of books by Steven Gould, and while I loved this film, most critics panned it. The story centers around a young Davey (Hayden Christensen), who during a life-threatening event, come to realize he has the power to teleport wherever he wants. Unbeknownst to Davey, he is a member of a group of genetically superior humans known as Jumpers, who are currently at war with a religious organization, that believes their power is evil. What starts out as a simple kid having fun and trying to impress, becomes a fight for survival in this amazing action thriller. You can always tell when a story is adapted from a book, rather than an original screenplay, because the story tends to be more thought out. Not to say screenplays are bad, but when a story isn't made simply to be a movie, it tends to be much more focused on the story, where as screenplays have to worry about the story as well as the aesthetics. Nevertheless, Jumper isn't just another shoot 'em story, it's the perfect mix of action and drama with some outstanding performances. I love Hayden Christensen, who I think is made for roles like this, he has this cool demeanor to him, that's more clever than arrogant. Jamie Bell is also terrific as Griffin, a fellow jumper Davey meets along the way,  and he provides some much needed comic relief. ...and then there's Samuel L. Jackson. What is there to say about Jackson that hasn't already been said? The man is a legend. This film is interesting, unique, fast-paced, and even funny. I loved every minute of Jumper and if Sci-Fi is your thing, you will too!"}, {"rating": "2", "text": "''Jumper'' sets a very interesting premise and gives interest to public with its somewhat original story,  but all this is spoiled by its extremely tiny script and cheesy acting by all of its cast (unfortunately, Samuel L.

I got my copy on Bluray, it looked cool from the cover so, I bought it for 4.99 and watched it. I was surprised why critics didn't pan The Sixth Sense because its a hell of a confusing film. Jumper, on the other hand was a exciting thriller and I did like it."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Finally got a chance to watch this film, despite what the reviews may say Jumper is actually quite enjoyable. The story is very simple and to the point, the main character is an ass who uses his super powers to help himself live a life of leisure and travel, he then reconnects with the girl he liked as a child, takes her to Rome, discovers there is more people like him and people trying to kill people like him. Without giving too much away, this film ultimately sets out to do what its supposed to do with solid performances from \"captain stoneface\" Hayden Christensen, Rachel Bilson and Jamie Bell to carry it the rest of the way."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "One of the reasons superhero comics so often get held in contempt is because the shallowest (and commonest) ones are wish-fulfillment fantasies for adolescent boys, and adolescent boys tend to be pretty unnuanced, id-driven critters. For instance, they should be pretty pleased with Jumper, a naked power fantasy in which an ordinary kid abruptly gains a super-ability, quickly followed by wealth, ultimate freedom, no-strings sex, and the panting admiration of his hot dream-girl. What did he do to earn any of this? He was so very, very special and different from everybody else that he gets to do whatever he wants, and still get framed as the film's shining hero.\r First seen standing atop the Sphinx in Egypt and boasting to the audience about how he used to be \"a normal person, a chump, just like you,\" Hayden Christensen plays a mildly dorky kid who discovers he can teleport. So he runs away from home and starts robbing banks. Eight years later, he's a smug **** living in a swank high-rise full of stolen cash and shiny toys, and he's using his power for trivial things like approaching a random bar hottie a little faster, or getting the TV remote without having to lean forward. But then Samuel L. Jackson appears and opens up a case of Mace Windu-style whoop-ass on him. Shortly thereafter, Christensen learns that there are other teleporters\u2014or at least one, played with rakish charm by Chumscrubber star Jamie Bell\u2014and that they're being hunted by fanatics called paladins. Why? The paladins' supposed philosophical underpinnings come out in one tossed-off line about how only God should be everywhere at once, but basically, they're around as an excuse for a lot of big, explosive fight scenes, which director Doug Liman (The Bourne Identity) seems to have imported directly from an X-Men movie.\r Those scenes are easily the best part of Jumper: They're unlimited by logic or physics, which makes them dynamic and unpredictable, and Liman brings them off well, with a lot of literal flash and bang. But no exciting action can cover the film's profound shallowness and repulsive attitude toward everyone but Christensen. It isn't bad enough that he's a swaggering bastard who uses his powers exclusively to break laws and get whatever he wants\u2014one scene even pointedly shows him ignoring a situation where he could save otherwise unsaveable lives. Another has him using a moving car as a weapon by jumping it to Chechnya, then leaving the startled driver to be crushed by a tank. And a good chunk of the film is devoted to him easily impressing his high-school crush object Rachel Bilson, who's less a character than a bright-eyed mirror for his awesomeness. Come to think of it, maybe adolescent boys won't like Jumper after all; its irritating protagonist is more school bully than underdog hero."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Handicap lourd au d\u00e9marrage, Jumper est r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par ce crevard de Doug Liman, ce cr\u00e9tin qui surd\u00e9coupe chaque sc\u00e8ne d'action en tr\u00e8s petites lamelles d'un tiers de seconde comme dans une r\u00e9clame publicitaire pour ados : mal de cr\u00e2ne assur\u00e9.

Mas isso n\u00e3o significa que o filme tem de ser vazio e ruim em tudo que faz, n\u00e9?!A premissa do filme \u00e9 muito convidativa, pois lida com uma \"habilidade\" que qualquer pessoa iria querer, mas o desenvolvimento a partir disso \u00e9 muito ruim. Primeiro temos os personagens, que se agarram a arqu\u00e9tipos e se esfor\u00e7am muito para n\u00e3o sair deles. O roteiro insiste em chicles e n\u00e3o para um segundo para desenvolver nem se quer o protagonista, n\u00e3o de forma efetiva. \u00c9 como se os roteiristas tivessem medo de quitarmos durante o filme, por isso ele tenta for\u00e7ar um clima onde sempre est\u00e1 acontecendo na tela, enquanto o background da trama \u00e9 jogado no lixo. Temos diversas perguntas em mente, 95% delas n\u00e3o s\u00e3o respondidas e o filme n\u00e3o tem medo de fazer um furo atr\u00e1s do outro, com contradi\u00e7\u00f5es at\u00e9 mesmo no c\u00f3digo de moral do antagonista. A personagem feminina \u00e9 uma das mais mal escritas que tive o desprazer de acompanhar. O roteiro usa dela na cara dura pra motivar atitudes burras por parte do protagonista. O pior \u00e9 que tudo que tudo que acontece no filme vem a partir de conveni\u00eancias e condutas incompreens\u00edveis, desde o assalto no banco a \"saltar\" em p\u00fablico, pra qualquer um ver. T\u00e1 me dizendo mesmo que o protagonista nunca se questionou sobre outros Jumpers ou \"puts, acho melhor n\u00e3o fazer isso em publico\"?As cenas de a\u00e7\u00e3o eram muito boas - na minha imagina\u00e7\u00e3o, mas s\u00f3 nela mesmo. A c\u00e2mera \u00e9 tremida e a cinematografia \u00e9 confusa. \u00c9 muito dif\u00edcil entender o que est\u00e1 acontecendo quando tudo que voc\u00ea pode ver s\u00e3o planos fechados e atores fazendo express\u00f5es de raiva, surpresa e dan\u00e7ando. A falta de conte\u00fado no filme \u00e9 tamanha que chega um momento que \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio exibicionismo gratuito [na cena do carro teleportando no meio da cidade] s\u00f3 para satisfazer o desejo de espectadores burros  - \u00e9 assim que os roteiristas nos enxergam.Enfim, como conclus\u00e3o, acho que a melhor coisa a se fazer \u00e9 deixar uns filmes no passado mesmo.Audio: English, with Portuguese subtitles.
