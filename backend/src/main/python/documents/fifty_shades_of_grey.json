  "description": "When college senior Anastasia Steele steps in for her sick roommate to interview prominent businessman Christian Grey for their campus paper, little does she realize the path her life will take. Christian, as enigmatic as he is rich and powerful, finds himself strangely drawn to Ana, and she to him. Though sexually inexperienced, Ana plunges headlong into an affair -- and learns that Christian's true sexual proclivities push the boundaries of pain and pleasure.",

      "text": "\"Boring (Two Hours that Feel Like Two Weeks- the movie is too LOOOONG), Derivative (The Story of O and 9 1/2 Weeks both did it much better, and with a better-looking cast, if this S & M genre is your thing) and Embarrassingly Stupid, 50SOG is Dreck for Those Whose Brains Have Been Scooped Out\"\r You would have had to have your brain scooped out to buy into the absurd premise that this boring, monotonous, derivative, cheesy-porno dreck has anything to do with love, or even satisfactory coupling.  If you manage to make it through the movie without nodding off at the tedium or just cutting your losses and leaving early, you will understand why the distributors and their media enablers had to promote the heck out of this dog to get people into the theatres. The record that 50SOG should be setting is \"the year's biggest gotcha.\" What a bunch of hype for a zero of a movie.\r The thin storyline is nothing new. To reduce it to its basics and give nothing away that you probably have not already surmised just from the trailer and the heavy hype leading up to its release:  Sicko beats up Flavor of the Moment and she pretends to enjoy it in exchange for access to Sicko's money and trappings, natch.  Charming, huh?  A romantic Valentine story?  Not and not.\r Tinsel Town has reached another low in this stinker of a movie with its fake flagellations, man-on-woman violence and gratuitous sex.  About the best that can be said is that at least you get to sit in a theatre seat out of the winter cold for two hours, and you do have two hours of escapism where you do not have to consider the day's beheadings by the Islamic terrorists steadily expanding their already-New Hampshire-sized territory.\r 50SOG is pretty much devoid of imagination:  If this S & M genre is your thing, the oldie The Story of O, or even 9 1/2 Weeks, is not as tedious as this movie is, and those casts are better-looking and better actors.  Older filmgoers might also vaguely equate the lack of merit in 50SOG with the icky, degrading Last Tango in Paris:  Maria, the butter.  Ana baby, the whip.  Hollywood cannot seem to \"discipline\" itself to avoid these irresponsible and degrading themes.\r Obviously, 50SOG is unapologetically anti-woman and pro-sexual-violence, and generations of women with any sense of history or context (and critical thinking skills surpassing those of a second grader - and let us not forget that most second graders would have a keener sense of stranger danger than apparently the stupid Ana does) are hurling in their popcorn to think that any moviegoers, particularly the confused women who have fueled the success of this dud in both book and now movie form, mistake sexual assault and battery with love, romance or satisfactory coupling.  Sexual abuse is not love.  Abuse is not cute, not clever, not cool, not fun, not funny, not entertaining.  Abuse is sick and an offense.  Where is the PC Police when you really need them?\r The US film industry must be pretty dead, too, if Melanie Griffith's daughter could not get better work than this merde, given her connections.\r Bottom line, as is obvious from my opinion as expressed in this review, and which also seems to be the 186 to 132 majority view of reviewers on this thread:  Save your time and money for a good movie, as 50SOG stinks.  About the only reason to waste your time with this dog is if it is a cold day and you need a place to get in out of the elements for two (long) hours and you only have $14 in your pocket.  Otherwise, stay clear.- La Mer\r Rating: One half of one star out of five stars."

It seemed like the creators only wanted to dwell upon that, but unfortunately had to create some background story, because you don't get directly to sex, you get porno if you do. So all the plot is extremely weak and its only purpose is to provide the terms for sex. Characters behave unrealisticaly, they do unreasonable and random stuff, they get horny by looking and each other lips etc.\rYou might think \"Well, I bet at least the sex scenes themselves are cool\". No, they are not. They are neither appealing, nor horryfying, nor passionate. They are lame and boring. The deep breathing, fist clenching, shouting etc. seem out of place for there is no real cause for them.\rAnd it gets more and more random. During one of the final scenes which were supposed to be extremely dramatic and make viewers cry the entire cinema hall started to clap and burst into laughs because what was happenning on the screen was random, illogical and simply stupid."

As it was hyped by the media and released for Valentine's Day, I expected steamy, playful sex games...I was wrong. The young woman is a wide-eyed innocent. She is drawn to a handsome, well-dressed man who, despite brief flashes of whimsy or vulnerability, slowly reveals himself to be a brutal monster. This film glamorizes violence toward, and exploitation of women. If any of the young women or men lined up to see this film come away thinking that inflicting pain on another person is sexy, it will be a very sad outcome from all this gratuitous promotion of an ugly film dressed up to look pretty."

Okay, Jamie Dornan was good as Christian Grey and Dakota Johnson was HOT. But the movie is very odd, the sex scenes are cut down so much, that it reaches the R rated level. The story confused me, part of Christian likes Anastacia,  but part of him doesnt. The movie was LOONG, it held barely any of my attention for 2 hours and 2 minutes. FSOG is a boring movie, it is an erotica that fails on its premise. This is a dissapointing adaptation,  that fans will surely have some fun with, but not be totally satisfied."

Ana is totally one dimensional and Mr Grey is actually kind of an **** and i feel like it's a cash grab due to the book selling so well to middle aged wifeys. Also, the film doesn't really seem erotic but almost glorifies sexual violence as a pleasure. I can imagine many females almost being offended by this and i as a male believe it is wrong to show as the main theme of the film almost. I know it's in other films but they never glorify in it and usually it's only a scenes worth in other films. This film is based around it. Awful."

      "text": "Just finished watching Fifty Shades of Grey and I gotta say... the film was beautiful. Yes, I am using the word beautiful to describe this movie. I went into the theater completely prepared to be embarrassed because of how graphic it was supposed to be, but I was extremely surprised by how I actually felt. I watched all of the scenes that were made available and thought that it all seemed a bit awkward, but it was only because there was no background music or noise. Watching the actual scenes in the movie was a whole other experience.\rThe movie is getting a really bad rep because of the bad writing and graphic scenes that are in the book that it is based on. However, the movie is not just a \"sex movie\" like everyone says. It's pretty hilarious and romantic. The sex scenes were extremely dialed down and they all served a purpose. If you thought the pointless sex in The Wolf of Wall Street was acceptable, then you would be more than okay with the content in this Fifty Shades. Before I watched Fifty Shades of Grey, I watched a lot of interviews with the cast of the film and was confused as to how they could possibly describe the sex scenes as being classy and elegant. But then again, all I had to compare it to were scenes from Game of Thrones, True Blood, The Wolf of Wall Street, etc... After watching this film, I can honestly say that I completely agree with the cast. There was nothing \"dirty\" or \"wrong\" about what I was seeing on the screen. Sam Taylor-Johnson, the director, did an excellent job with this movie. She made it very tasteful and easier to accept. This film could have gone in a very bad direction, but thank god it didn't.\rFor those of you that think that this movie is glorifying abusive relationships, think again because I think that it actually empowers women. I'm sure that you can argue, with quotes from the book, that I'm wrong, but there are many differences between the film and the book. Let me remind all of you that the book is a little over 500 pages and the movie is only about 2 hours long. Obviously, they had to cut a lot of things out, including the blue string scene that I'm sure a lot of people are aware of. In my opinion, they cut out many of the scenes that were considered controversial. I watched the movie looking for signs of an abusive relationship, but I really didn\u2019t see anything of that nature. In fact, all I saw was this confident and empowered woman that made all of her own decisions. She was not forced to do anything that she didn\u2019t want to do. She wanted to explore Christian\u2019s dark world and her own sexuality. You can argue that Christian abuses her physically and emotionally, but he does what she tells him to do. When she says stop\u2026 he stops. He tries to give her what she wants.\rMoving on to something lighter, the comedy in this movie is on point! There were many \u201claugh-out-loud\u201d moments that gave the movie a lighter mood. Those scenes were there to show that Christian and Ana\u2019s relationship was not all dark and serious. I mean they are both young people in their twenties that should be having fun!\rDakota Johnson gave a phenomenal performance and did everything right! She was confident, awkward, shy, and funny all at the same time. Jamie Dornan also did an amazing job as Christian Grey. They had great chemistry.\rI guess what I\u2019m trying to say is that you should give the movie a chance. If you hate the book, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you will hate the movie. I have read many reviews, written by skeptics, saying that they ended up loving it. Don\u2019t let the bad reviews or even the book itself stop you from seeing the movie. I was not disappointed at all with the finished product, even though they cut out a few scenes that I loved. It is perfect just the way it is.\r(I apologize for any grammatical mistakes... Unlike Ms. Steele, I am not an English major)"

I thought Anastasia was too unattractive for the part, but played a good innocent type with a dominating side to herself. Christian Grey was cast well. For the most part, the movie was weak and easy to make fun of. It did not turn me on at all. I think this is more for the young and inexperienced in life. I think it's sad when a person has to result in getting tortured to feel fulfilled. Overall, not impressed."

      "text": "Fifty Shades of Grey more like Fifty Shades of Abuse.\r The story is about a literature student, interviews the wealthy, intimidating Christian Grey and instantly develops an attraction to the enigmatic man. Grey is likewise drawn to Ana - but will only agree to a relationship on his own terms. Both will discover a place where want and desire intersect.\r Fifty Shades of Grey was a movie that I had zone interested in, because I was in that bad mood where if I see a best selling novel being made into a movie which is a cliche now, and now there did it with Fifty Shades of Grey which by the way the book sucked ass, yeah I red the book and I had no idea why it was a best seller it's basically porn on paper. What's more annoying is in the UK there are people on the Radio and everyone I met who was looking forward to this movie and my Question is why. The people on the Radio keep making top stories about it making it the hot headline and I'm here thinking \"That's really new worthy. There's loads of usual but amazing things happening around the world and this peace of **** makes the headline. My hope for humility is slowly fading away\". And that's not all, I'm not kidding you here but there actually made a headline of it's reviews it's getting and this never happened before when it comes to movies. So after seeing Fifty Shades of Grey I can say it's not as bad as people say, it's actually a lot worse then I thought.\r Now let me give you the positive things in this movie: Dakota Johnson was the only good actress in this movie, she did what she can do with a god awful script that she had and shes the only one in this movie that gives it her all. The movie is shot really good as well, it fitted the movie very well, but beside's that all those good things can't hind the fact that this is a abomination against humanity, it brings shame to cinema and it should be burn in hell.\r Now let's talk about Mr. Grey The Psychopath, now I got to ask you this what do women see in this guy, I mean his not charming at all, his cold, he's kind of a **** and what he want's to do is hurt you with sex, and the actor himself isn't really that good at all. And she doesn't enjoy it she only does it to make him feel good so in the sex scenes she's not enjoying it, she's getting hurt by this guy and after a while she get's crossed with him and then she runs off then start's to have thoughts about him and how she needs a man in her life so she goes back.\r The writing in this movie I don't know if it's for comic relief or to be taken seriously, because the writing in this movie was absolutely atrocious and it's the most cheesiest dialogue ever put to film, it's Twilight dialogue bad.\r Now is this worse than Twilight and I can't believe I'm saying this but yes it is. I found a movie that's more awful and more laughable than Twilight. I hated this movie, I hated it, I HATED IT, I HATED IT. This is the worst movie of 2015, I can't wait to forget this film. You better off seeing Kingsman: The Secret Service, I haven't see it myself yet but at least that movie looks well made and effort went into it."

You can interpret that she doesnt like the way he is or the way he treats her, but she still got into BDSM practices, and the important WHY she did it, its totally missing. To make this movie even worse, one of the things that people critizised about the book, is that BDSM is practiced by people with psychological problems, people that need help, people that are sick... and once again this movie fails into proyecting this same way of seen Grey as a sick person.\r Bad sex scenes, failure in thansmiting the main ideas of the bdsm and Anastasias thoughts, and TERRBLE performance of the principal character Christian Grey, in the movie he looks like an idiot, VERY different form the book.\r Dont waste your time watching this movie, I know many people dont like to read, but believe me, if you want to know what the fifty shades are all about, you better read the books."

The actions that are taken by the characters are unrealistic and are forced without legitimate motivation other than the shallow romantic tension between the two main characters."

Luckily, saw this in Spanish in Mexico City which made it far more entertaining than it should be. Dakota Johnson is pretty damn good though. Question: Why does each generation need a story like this? From STORY OF O to 9 1/2 WEEKS to 50 SOMBRAS DE GREY. WHY? Inquiring minds want to know."

No story, no character development, no resolution, and grade school dialog make this the loser film of the year. Before I even said a thing after the ending, my date apologized for dragging me out to this atrocity.\r This sums it up: Let's write a novel about every girl's fantasy unicorn of a man, include an S&M component to add an aspect of taboo in order to pique more interest, then start a viral marketing campaign to get people to talk about the novel. This'll cause everyone to read it to see what the big deal is. When they find out there's no big deal, they'll be asking everyone else, what the big deal was, spiraling the virality of the novel. And then of course, capitalize on the commercial success of this marketing ploy by making a film on the cheap and let the viral aspect do all the marketing of the film for you.\r Final step, use your Benji's from novel/film profits to light up your contraband Cubans whilst bathing in champagne."

      "text": "So, I don't know what kind of dimwitted mind thought this was a steamy film, or even a romantic film for grown-ups. \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" is and feels like the byproduct of a corporative contract. If the book it's based on is just laughably pedestrian and dull, the film equivalent nearly rivals it in monotony. There's no emotion, no passion, no life; like Christian Grey, it's all cold, calculated and mechanic. Want to watch a real steamy film about sex for grown-ups? Please go and watch Stanley Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut' and avoid this infantile, seems-to-be-made-for-promiscuous-teenage-girls drivel at all costs. And, the 'strong sexual content' that the MPAA rating suggests is a joke."

I was not the only person to spend most of the film laughing at the endlessly boring scenes of terrible dialogue given by one dimensional characters with not a shred of chemistry between them. No character development whatsoever with lame attempts at adding backstory that at that point I just didn't care about. As for the rest of the film, to say it was cringeworthy is an understatement, awkward and pathetic.\rTo everyone involving in the making of this \"film\": if you set out to make a good movie you have failed miserably, but if you set out to make money gratulations and enjoy your time upon your giant throne of money to which I am sorry to say I contributed."

There is supposed to be a build up to the intimate scenes but even those are really really boring and nonsensical. I won't even  go into how deeply offended and violated the movie made me feel as a woman. Disgusting. Worst movie I've watched so far."

It's rigid performances and sobering book accuracy make for one of the most unnatural romance films in recent history. There is no chemistry here,no drama,no concerning conflict. Just a billionaire with unresolved ptsd and a God complex. It's unfortunate how seeing the supposedly sexy words that captured many on pages be said by real life people without discernable irony such as the repulsive flirting post contract negotiation or the now infamous don't make love I **** To be honest I can't really admonish the film as it didn't have a lot to go on but with that said the actors didn't help. Jamie Dornan is unwatchable as the presumably (I presume because it's never expressed) sexy bachelor, he feels wooden and not in the intended way Christian was written (albeit terribly) to be. Dakota Johnson at least attempts and is unsuprisingly the only one willing to go bare for the sake of her charater. Another thing I  found frustrating was how no arcs were explored satisfyingly such as Jos\u00e9 attempted assault, the family dinner,his intimacy issues,Anna's fears etc. They just use every scene as interludes b4 they f ,nit as opportunities to develop characters. Overall this is a sprawling yet bare 2hr disappointment that I can't stop chastising."
