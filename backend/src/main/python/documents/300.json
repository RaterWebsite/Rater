Battle of Thermopylae, where the King of Sparta led his army against the advancing Persians; the battle is said to have inspired all of Greece to band together against the Persians, and helped usher in the world's first democracy.",

Straight to the point . It capture the heart of this historic battle , something that historic documentaries have failed to do . It does not try to put drama into the scenario, it does try to make Spartan look human. It is not try to outsmart the viewer.It is only show what Spartans were. If you are after seeing a really \"great\" movie, then open your eyes, and open a book. Read what Sparta was all about. And then go to see the movie , then you will understand why . Simply perfect.

Though the super saturated look is interesting, the repetitive environments and cinematography grows monotonous awefully fast. Call it campy, but the lack of humor, and expectance on the viewer to care about the characters puts this movie in the mediocre area. That said watching this movie is fun, if only for the gratuitous violence and even the corn helps make it a funny video to watch with friends. But, its insistance on taking itself seriously is its downfall, and keeps it from being a \"so bad its good\" movie. See it for brainless entertainment, but don't expect more."

A very clever thing they did was have the training of a Spartan boy in the beginning of the movie, which actually was quite close to what actually happened back then. To tell the truth, the storyline was good, but could have used a little more work. I thought Gerard Butler was a great choice for Leonidas, though Lena Headey was a bit flat. 300 is a great movie for those who can stand LOTS of blood and guts, and the occasional bare women's chest with nothing censoring it, with a sex scene and a rape scene. You don't see much, nor are they long scenes. And the slow mo scenes were awesome."

His acting was superb along with his fighting. 300 cannot be topped. It is effortlessly Sheer Perfection in all aspects since it encompassed so much different themes: Love, Brutality, Revenge, and even humour along with all the rest. It is a movie that is beyond all others and could not and will not be able to be done any better. It should be more accurately rated as exponential to infinity!"

They didn't include E!Online or Chicago Sun Times which gave it an A and A- meaning in the 90's. Seattle Post gave it a B+. An 83 isn't a B+. For more comparisons go to:\rhttp://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1809262865/critic\r For the movie history wise, it is very inaccurate. The Persians was the only empire who called their kings, kings of kings, not gods as referred to in this movie. The Persians were also the first to start freedom of speech, religion, and freedom itself.\r THE MOVIE: The movie is very good. The cinematography was amazing. Every scene, every shot was taken with skill. The sound and visuals add even more to the experience. Very well done. The acting was exceptionally done by Gerard Butler and the Spartans, but some other characters were a bit off. The sex and nude scenes though did seem a bit too forced. Also, Xerxes did look a little gay. Xerxes in the movie is portrayed by a Brazilian actor which doesn't make any sense at all. Beside Xerxes had a beard. Overall the movie is very good and I recommend anybody who still hasn't seen it to go and watch it while it's still in theaters."

A lot of people complain that this movie is very inaccurate historically. That is partly true however there were some parts in which the movie was historically accurate. The Spartans really did throw out there kids and they really did give them brutal training they really did grow up in a world of violence. However the the movie was inaccurate in some of the battle scenes. There weren't really trolls the Spartan soldiers did were armor on their torsos and the famous line ''we will fight in the shade'' was not said by after a Spartan sliced off a Persian army however the arrows did block out the sun they got that part right. No doubt about it this movie is hard core except for the end were the king went soft. The battle scenes were very satisfying to watch.The story is enough to keep you interested in what will happen next.however if its the historically inaccurate content that deflects your interest away from the movie than watch a documentary or something. This movie was not intended to be historically accurate.There is some content that they just didn't need to put in there but if you want some graphically realistic movie than you've come to the right place. Over all this movie is worth watching if you a fan of action movies. the acting was good and its a good movie overall."

Not to mention people saying the corniest one liners and that's it, just one line and then nothing for minutes on end. Seems to be more of a propaganda piece to just dehumanize Persians (think Iranians) and make them look like savages. Neither side was innocent, and they're both godless and brutal societies. (The last line about ushering in a new age of \"free thought\" and an end to mysticism is a real kicker, since the Greeks believed in their own made up religion.) Not to mention, they ruined an intriguing historical tale that could of gone places. Soulless, airless, they seriously must just take a giant crap and throw $20 million at it and call it a movie."

      "text": "Unabashed entertainment, beautifully rendered and digitally touched up, excellently scoped and choreographed, 300 is at its best when it is throwing bodies around. Much of the side drama feelings like a side drama, leaving the target audience craving even more of its ultraviolent ancient warfare. It is a bloody and lewd picture, absolutely not for the kids, but for people desensitized enough to accept a movie where most of the warriors aren't treated as people, and by the body count alone, life has very little meaning until it is gone, if then. It is funny that its few bare breasts and short erotic sequences receive more protest than the various dismemberments, but be prepared for both, and be prepared to enjoy them, or don't see 300 at all. This is not a profound movie, often stopping short where it might examine greater morality or elevate the plot. Instead, its best dramatic feature is how it makes you believe things will happen when you walked into the movie theatre knowing they couldn't. If you rate this as a high drama, you miss its point - it is a superb action movie and needs to be judged and enjoyed as such. With all its references to Greek and specifically Spartan patriotism, its bold moral values unshared by mainstream America, and a plot driven by Persian aggression on European soil, this movie is absolutely not an allegory for America's conflicts with the Middle East, and only the dimwitted could see this as supporting an American war with Iran. However if that does happen, many marines may use this to psych themselves up."

It's this visceral beauty that makes it watchable, more so than a film that focuses on the fundamental story. 300 applies to males; those of you who don't appreciate slaughter and gore will not find it appealing. It's a movie that you have to watch without criticising, because you will surely find a fallacy within its simplicity and emphasis on visuals."

This movie was not made to offer a historical account of how things happened and as such one can find a lot of inconsistencies. I read a comment about the Spartans being savages and worthless (LOL!) now how can they be worthless and victorious at the same time (although they were all killed this was a HUGE strategic victory) I do not know. I have to say though that there is a tendency in this movie to portray the Persian army as decadent and weak but I think this serves as a method to contrast the two civilizations and their strengths and weaknesses. For example the Spartans were exceptional in hand-to-hand combat while the Persian army relied on archers and cavalry (including chariots).Furthermore, the Spartan soldiers wore heavy armour and carried large round shields in contrast to their opponents who wore expensive jewellery and bright coloured garments -to impress their adversaries with their wealth- and light armour (their shields were made from some kind of bamboo).Both civilizations were equally magnificent (in my book) and the fact that the 'immortals' are portrayed as deformed people is outrageous. Further to that the Persian army had no ogres and goblins (lol) and I do not think they brought any elephants or rhinoceros to fight the Spartans. The side story with the Spartan queen being 'raped' is 100% BS - if there was ONE place in the world at that time where women had power and were respected (sometimes even more than men) that was Sparta...I cannot imagine any woman being raped in Sparta let alone the QUEEN! Since the movie is based on a COMIC BOOK I believe it was wise to use a CG environment and give it a gleam tone so that it will look like a comic. The fight sequences are very impressive and I think this is a very good action movie overall."
