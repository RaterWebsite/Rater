  "description": "It's vacation time for Carter as he finds himself alongside Lee in Hong Kong wishing for more excitement. While Carter wants to party and meet the ladies, Lee is out to track down a Triad gang lord who may be responsible for killing two men at the American Embassy. Things get complicated as the pair stumble onto a counterfeiting plot. The boys are soon up to their necks in fist fights and life-threatening situations. A trip back to the U.S. may provide the answers about the bombing, the counterfeiting, and the true allegiance of sexy customs agent Isabella.",

      "text": "In short, one of the worst movies I have ever seen. In long, it's an insipid trip through China where virtually all of the humor is derived from cheap sexism and racism (I'm really a guy that can appreciate the humor in this, but all of the jokes were so unoriginal and flat), as opposed to the fun and ridiculous situations in the first Rush Hour. Jackie Chan's acting is more tired than it has ever been before, and Chris Tucker's antics get worn thin after the first 5 minutes. To me, this ranks among the worst sequels ever made (right alongside Lawnmower Man 2 - there, I said it.)"

Though it did kind of mimic the basic plot of the first and followed some of the cop hero movie clich\u00e9s it still gave me good laughs and contains many quotable lines. It is definitely one that is a must see if you haven't seen it yet, if you haven't you must live under an uncultural rock. not a joke on many Asian vs American references."

I don't really know why it's the weakest of the three, but it just doesn't seem quite as good. Still very enjoyable and definitely worth a watch if you are a fan of the first film."

      "text": "I enjoyed the sequel just that little bit more than the first thanks to a few things. There was more Action and I think the addition of two kick-ass females in the mix really helped things out. Chan & Tucker still work great together and I can't help but be impressed by Chan's commitment to the stunts as well. Storyline is pretty straight forward and more about the Action rather than the content, but overall a solid Action/Comedy that I think outshined the original just that little bit."

      "text": "It is the type of a more of the same sequel. Again this is an action comedy / buddy movie made enjoyable by Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker performances. It is however not as good and refreshing as the prequel. Over the years my rating declined a bit but I still say it is worth watching. The story starts with James Carter played by Chris Tucker visiting Hongkong to meet his friend inspector Lee played by Jackie Chan. However due to a critical event at the US Consulate the holiday is cut short and ends with the two banding together to safe the day. The story works but is mostly a vehicle to carry the characters, action and humor. It is entertaining but not that special. The main appeal is of cause the buddy movie aspect. I repeat my statement from the prequel that Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker work well together. Their good chemistry carries the movie and is enjoyable. Jackie Chan does the action and Jackie Chan stuff people expected and Chris Tucker adds a lot of humor to it. I must admit that by Jackie Chan standards it is a weaker performance compared to his better movies (Clarification: It is still an enjoyable performance and not garbage as I have yet to see a movie were he fails). In addition to this I always enjoy Zhang Ziyi since \u201cHero\u201d and both John Lone and Roselyn Sanchez did a good performance too. The humor itself works well enough to entertain but I can not remember a remarkable joke except the hilarious chicken scene (Those with the language barrier;-). On paper so far this looks really good. Sadly like I already said it has some weakness. The movie is basically a redoing of the prequel minus the pulling together in a new setting. Without the main actors this would be average at best and it uses a bit of too much tropes and stereotypes. After watching this in the cinema I would have given an 8/10 same as the prequel but after some time I realized that it was not that good. I am struggling between a 6/10 or 7/10 now. I will give a rounded up 7/10 because of the cast and main actors. Want not to end this to negative and say I still prefer this over many modern spoof movies any day."
