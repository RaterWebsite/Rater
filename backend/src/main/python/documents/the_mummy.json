Perhaps critics who had seen 1932's the Mummy were disappointed in the direction of the film.  I'm not quite sure.  I find that many of the complaints from critics were actually the high notes for this movie for me.  It terrified me in the theaters as a young child, in my teens I watched it multiple times with various friends, now I watch it at least twice a year and quote it constantly.  It's a part of my life and one of the best adventure films every made."

      "text": "The Last Great Adventure FilmDon't get me wrong, we have had lots of great movies since '99, but I really feel that this is the last one where it was just 10 for 10 great. And it was a great way to end the 90's, which I still believe to be one of the best movie decades; we knew how to make great movies and we knew how to make great trailers for those great movies--not just rapidly flashing scenes with drums and clashing and building violins, but REAL trailers edited to perfection with great music.\"The Mummy\" just packs it all; from Adventure to Horror to Fantasy to Drama to Comedy, and in my humble opinion, it succeeds superbly in all five genres. It is just such a FUN movie! The sites (and sights), the sound design, the CGI (while I won't say it's perfect), and, of course, Jerry Goldsmith's masterpiece of a score which can take Alan Silvestri's for \"The Mummy Returns\" to the cleaners any day of the week.While \"The Mummy\" was a blockbuster, it is sadly one of those unappreciated movies. Shortly after its release is when movies began to take a turn for the worse and become darker, and for what ever crackbutt reason, darker is what the American Audience wants. Audiences just want movies where everyone dies (a lot of the time including the hero(es)), the music is heavily synthesized, and the plot is simplistic.\"The Mummy\" is an epic adventure from beginning to end. And I can only hope that our movies return to this movie-type some day soon. While I do like \"The Mummy Returns\", it was a little too silly for me. And \"Tomb of the Dragon Emperor\"? No comment. The first one just captures the fun-ness that movies are SUPPOSED to be; a movie that grabs you out of your world so you almost feel as if you're IN the movie (he said, at the risk of sounding either cheezy or loony), very much in the tradition of \"Jurassic Park\" and its sequel.It's just truly a classic, and will hopefully remain so long enough to see a day when it is appreciated again."

Rachel Weisz is super hot as Evy, a librarian who awakens Imhotep, the mummy, and then has to stop him. She is captured by Imhotep in order to be sacrificed to bring his love back. Now it's up to Rick O'Connell, played by Brendan Fraser, to rescue her. With tons of action and a totally cool plot, this movie is a great edition to any movie collection. Fraser is awesome as O'Connell, who knows something is alive under the sand of Hamunaptra, City of The Dead, and then he has to stop the evil from spreading. He is a funny action hero, and he does his best work in this movie. Rachel Weisz does a super job. John Hannah plays her brother Johnathon, who is some of the comedic support. Kevin J. O'Connor is also awesome as Beni, a little weasel in league with Imhotep. He is very funny. All in all, this movie is great and is one of my favorites!"

The movie was actually pretty good, with a good story and okay script, but Fraser is marginal at best. There's something about him that makes it so that I can't take him seriously in any movie. The stupid, bad comedies he's done (Furry Vengeance, I'm looking at you) have damaged his reputation. The Mummy is a pretty serious movie, but I can't take Fraser seriously in it. He could play a businessman in a Wall Street thriller and I would still think that at any time he's going to resort to slapstick humor somehow."

Disregard the whole thing where people are comparing this to Indiana Jones, I don't like to compare movies when I watch them unless they're a parody. To me these movies have their own identity and this movie is just great, go see it."

The acting is great, the action scenes were well made, the story was interesting and the movie was a lot of fun. Despite the dated CGI effects and the failed comedy moments, it's still a pretty good movie."
