I'm happy to give it a 7 rating as a skillful, albeit conventional big-budget tribute to the heroism of the city. (Everybody loves self-compliments, after all.) In my opinion it really could have worked much more compellingly if the composite character had been dialed back. One quality of a good semi-documentary is to subordinate the actors to the story. THE LONGEST DAY did that, as did THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS, to name two that immediately come to mind. No one individual dominates those narratives. In them, only God sees everything, and is everywhere. It was counterproductive for Wahlberg's character to be omnipresent; that initial creative decision unintentionally evoked a tone of Hollywood artificiality which was the last thing the movie needed.

First responders and investigators are racing against the clock to hunt down the sneaky muslim bombers before they strike again. It can't be watchable to anyone but American patriots, right?Wrong. \"Patriots Day\" is actually a solid action thriller which seems realistic enough, even handling some more trivial details like how the bombers look like exactly. it avoids the excessive corniness and epic-ness till the last minutes and plays it like a catastrophe movie followed by exciting manhunt. The cameras are out there with us, in the middle of it all, and it still looks good. Another good example of how to handle the shaky in-your-face style of action that is often strongly disliked or even hated in movies.The stories of the main characters are rather vague and shallow, so good that they are relegated to sidelines. Mark Wahlberg has one of the biggest roles and does his usual thing which seems really pretty interesting only for the maybe first three times you see him in movies.You know, that humble and tender joe everyman that has a big heart but also gets **** done where it really matters. Like a action version of Adam Sandler or something.There are some big boyz of Hollywood involved, to make the movie more solid and prestigious, including John Goodman, Kevin Bacon and underused J. K. Simmons. It's amazing how effective this kind of playaz can be to bring almost any story to life. They make serious faces, talk their serious talk and make the world a better place. Works every time. \"Patriots Day\" is a tight enough package already... and they make it even more watch-worthy. Seriously.Boston Marathon bombing is good basis for a Hollywood movie. It's recent and true-life, so it can turn populist without getting too much criticism for it, and there's also creative freedom to add pretty much anything you want to a story.So no wonder there are more movies on the horizon. \"Stronger\" with Jake Gyllenhaal in the lead is coming already, and there's also some project called \u201eBoston Stronger\u201c...All in all, this is certainly by far the most fun I've had watching a movie directed by Peter Berg.

I mean all I knew was the marathon bombing, but I came to know that was only half, the other half was even more serious events that stretched for like a week after the original event.The best part of the film was, there were no solo heroes in this story. Everybody contributed in some way to fight against the evil. The screenplay was shared by all the great actors, even small role ones equally. I loved how it all went on, as a team from different forces, but tackled the situation by joining the hands. I don't know it was only the film, but very impressive. That's patriotism!In the opening, you could see different people from different places of Boston preparing for the big event. And then they all end up in the same place where a series of explosion goes up. Quickly the security agencies come together and investigate it. With a small clue, kicks starts the manhunt. This is the part I loved it. Hunting pisslam pigs are always so pleasure to watch.Suspense, thriller, the story was well paced and took forward with a wonderful ending. Awesome direction. Another hit in a single year alongside 'Deepwater Horizon'. Interesting, Wahlberg involved in both these films. I've also heard that the two screenplays was merged to make a single film. One was a drama and the other one was an action packed story. That's why it was well balanced between everything. From individual's story to together in the events.

The filmmakers will try to claim this awful style is more realistic and puts you into the story which could not be more of a ridiculous fallacy.  Why simulate a poorly shot documentary in a narrative feature, especially a substantially budgeted Hollywood motion picture?  It has the exact opposite effect on an audience who is much better off watching Dateline, 48 Hours, or YouTube than sitting through this.  The hack director is to blame of course.  He has no visual sense, lousy aesthetic taste, no understanding of cinema beyond the surface, and no true care or insight into audience psychology.  Dopey approving youths who don't care or know any better make for an unsophisticated audience.  He may be just swell to work with and run a set on schedule and budget, which certainly not everyone can do, but plenty in Hollywood can just fine and with way better results!  Also the stars who stupidly, blindly go along in their blanket trust instead of saying \"hold on, I'm not okay appearing in that cheap gimmicky style\" are also every bit to blame and prove themselves typically oblivious.  As it is, some of the dialogue and how it's delivered is laughably phony.This movie has so many time/setting sub-titles it nearly becomes spoof.  And no disrespect to the actual victims and responders to the terrorist evil, but the epilogue of them actually talking on camera is so out of place and goes on so long it completely negates the attempted spell that just transpired.  It's yet another dumb trend in movies based on true stories, but rarely has it been so botched and misconceived as here by the hacks behind the scenes.

Unfortunately, Mark Walberg, just like his director, are more interested in generating big revenue through big explosions and falsely generated drama than telling the poignant, restrained and honest version of what really happened to our city during that week.If you are not from Boston, you will probably find this film entertaining, which is exactly what the producers wanted. But to the citizens of Boston, the real life bystanders and witnesses of all the incidents, and to all the victims, this a not a respectful film.

The continual drone in the soundtrack by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross helps keep the pressure up.

It occasionally incorporates actual surveillance video and news report footage, and the actors bear a remarkable resemblance to the individuals whose roles they depict.  The passage of time often sanitizes memories of just how fearful Boston and Watertown residents felt when the suspects were on the loose and they were asked by authorities to shelter in place.  The movie brilliantly reminds viewers that a virtual all-out war occurred between the suspects and the police in a quiet, densely-housed, narrow-streeted residential neighborhood in the middle of the night.  It avoids getting overtly preachy, although there is some understandable rah-rah Boston depicted toward the end.

The film was directed by Peter Berg who co-wrote the screenplay with Matt Cook and Joshua Zimmer. Splendidly acted by Mark Wahlberg, Kevin Bacon, John Goodman and J.K. Simmons, the film tells in detail the efforts of law enforcement to track down and ultimately either capture or kill the two terrorist brothers responsible for the attack. One might wonder how a film can engender suspense and interest when its outcome is already known to most if not all of its viewers.  \u201cSully\u201d is a perfect example that such a feat can be accomplshed when there is enough material and good writing to make it happen. Also, like \u201cSully\u201d the coda at the end of the film introduces us to the real life people who were portrayed in the film which gives glaring reality to the events depicted in it.  I truly enjoyed the film, not only for the good writing and acting , but for the information imparted to the audience as law enforcement worked tirelessy and with speed to end the nightmare that befell the City of Boston.

Until now, that is. For, both \"Deepwater Horizon\" and - now - \"Patriots' Day\" remain staggeringly masterful docudramas with enough heart, respect, and intrigue to turn even the biggest skeptics (like myself) into Berg-worshippers. With this film in particular, you get an absolutely fantastic sense of just how brave Berg can be in handling certain subjects - especially ones that are more than just fresh in everyone's heads. \"Patriots' Day\" stares directly into the abyss that is the 2013 Boston Marathon attack and doesn't flinch at all. It depicts the event in all its unrelenting ugliness and brutality, whilst still staying far enough away from the realms of exploitation and bombast to convince you that this movie simply needed to happen. It weaves universally-appealing themes of community, love, and perseverance into a superbly structured narrative that is as all-encompassing in terms of perspective as it is in scale and time. This is, all at once, a pulse-pounding thriller that showcases the valiant efforts of the authorities involved, an inspiring tear-jerker about how a community can learn to heal in the face of such tremendous adversity, and a chilling cautionary tale about the dangers of extremist thinking and indoctrination of any form.

When you go to see a film about a relationship between a guy and a teddy bear, you assume it's safe to take the kids, but all you got in Ted was sexual perversion, drug abuse, and vulgar language. Everyone is this movie had gutter mouths. Do the Boston police men and women really talk like that? What a shame! I'm glad I rented it.

The terrorist attack, perpetrated by a Kyrgyz and a Soviet, which shook the annual and traditional Boston Marathon, near the finish line. Is there any bait more customary\u2014crowded by the fervent patriotic sense\u2014than an American athletic competition to congregate an immense deluge of pale faces around two explosions inspired by the animadversion-blasts? In this episode that left traces on the skin of the people from Boston is placed the story of Berg and Wahlberg, however, the leading actor in the story is the only apocryphal character in all that sea of realities. Tommy Saunders is a dipsomaniac sergeant, who to be active again in the assignment of true significance cases, he must be responsible for guarding the most important athletic event for his people, with not only a bruised knee, also his ego.Despite the diminished expertise, the director understands in advance what he wants and what utensils are essential to carry out his task: pay homage the brave men with an impressive wisdom, which helped them to not lose their sanity in the midst of such a maelstrom of madness. Appreciable is the dedicated approach to the supporting characters, showing a **** and coarse caution with respect to the exposition and corresponding ephemeris of those affected people by the terrorist attack, affected people with an introduction and conclusion as constrained as unsatisfactory. On the other side of the coin are the saviors, the main heroes of the odyssey led by Wahlberg, actor who has woven a consistent work camaraderie with Berg because of the services provided and whose best executed performance in the film triplet is achieved here, considering the overacting anti-terrorism message unsuitable basic and tacky that manifests the aberrant skills of the screenwriters for incorporating a required hopeful and educational lesson, an actor who continues his acting journey towards Ithaca, that symbolizes the property that only experience can confer: the apprehension that less is more, sometimes. Together with him are veracious titans in the field ranging from Simmons to Bacon, from Monaghan to Goodman, some actors impersonating researchers, others in roles of interviewer, keeping as a common factor the need to pay tribute to the true heroes. The script, which is riddled with possibilities, only manages to bring out a couple of them, leaving up in the air the potential of other conceptions that, with a different polishing, would have made the pleasures of the fussiest moviegoers. It's made up of a mosaic of ideas from three screenwriters that, most of the time, doesn't conclude on anything really optimized. The film expels core proposals that end up on the scrap heap due to they don't have a sense of direction.As for the recreation of the events, which was one of the most attractive and magnetic points for the audience, they decently built the calamity witnessed a few years ago. Opting for gunfights and chases executed with a hand-held camera, these result in an untidiness becoming disappointing, the fluctuation of the cameraman can be palpable, softening the meager beauty in the midst of so much human monstrosity. But there are fantastic scenes as the moment after the explosion from a high-angle shot.Berg fulfills his concern: to pay homage, full stop. It won't become a pressing classic about either American tragedies nor about the battle of a man for saving his people, but what matters here is the goal of the director: to honor those who were genuinely in the claws of smoke, fire, and turmoil. FBI agent, spectator, runner, Yankee, Latin American, of the yellow race, child, adult, needy, wealthy, clumsy, intellectual: human, everything is condensed in that, we're all human and we have to support ourselves in the time of cholera, in order to preserve our species. Ultimately, that's the moral message of the movie, and although this aura failed to encompass the event in its entirety, at least managed to communicate what generated the tragedy, which, by the misfortune of the attackers, had counterproductive sequels due to the bombs didn't divide us, these ones unified us."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "It does have a few issues but Patriots Day is a well crafted and extremely emotional movie.

The conflict in the story comes into play when the FBI comes to Boston and there seems to be a battle over jurisdiction.  The Boston police are conducting their own investigation but since it was thought to be terrorism the FBI feels it is now under their jurisdiction.  Throughout the movie you see the two sides working their own ways.  The Boston police are out on the streets trying to find leads in order to find the terrorists.  All the actors who are playing roles on both sides do an amazing portraying how important it was to everybody that these terrorists be caught.  J.K. Simmons is also in this movie and he does a great supporting role in being a small comic relief because this movie does have a lot of emotional weight to it.  J.K. Simmons character gives you a few seconds to breathe and that really benefits the movie.  The way the movie benefits is that the movie could\u2019ve been too caught up in the emotion that the movie would be very hard to get through. Next, the two actors who played the terrorists did a very good job, particularly the one playing the younger brother.  He showed the other side of the two that really wasn\u2019t sure if what they were doing was right.  Lastly, the acting in this movie is very good and every actor gives a emotional and deep performance.  This is one of, if not the best, performance Mark Wahlberg has given since The Fighter.  Wahlberg does an amazing job of really showing the human side of the all the officers who were there to respond to the bombings.  I\u2019m hoping to see Oscar talks for his performance because he deserves it.All in all Patriots Day is one of the best Mark Wahlberg performances I have ever seen and deserves Oscar consideration for this role.  But truly what this movie is about is people coming together ad working towards a goal.  Because when they finally catch the terrorists it is because the FBI and Boston Police are finally working together and as a result they catch the men responsible.  Also, be ready to shed a tear during this movie because the emotion from the actors just resonates so much that you can\u2019t help but feel emotional with them because you feel the weight of the events during the movie."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Even though the hero in this is a made up character and it does takes away from telling of a real life event, it's decent enough in portraying a city in grief."}], "recommendations": ["snowden", "13_hours_the_secret_soldiers_of_benghazi", "valkyrie", "deepwater_horizon", "zero_dark_thirty", "dark_waters", "argo", "spotlight", "the_mauritanian", "just_mercy", "the_monuments_men", "closed_circuit", "beirut", "darkest_hour", "hostiles", "allied", "hotel_rwanda", "nightcrawler", "the_last_duel", "the_good_shepherd", "only_the_brave", "richard_jewell", "flight", "the_imitation_game", "the_33"]}
