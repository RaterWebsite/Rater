Ethan Hawke \u2014 who should accept more villain roles now \u2014 and the child actors are amazing, especially the little girl, who is very likable and funny. But there's a character in there who seems out of place. You'll know who when you see him.'The Black Phone' doesn't break any new ground, and the ending may feel a little underwhelming and predictable, but the way Derrickson delivers tension, very calculated jump scares, and an intimate but socially relevant story is what distances this one from other generic mainstream horror films."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "It holds your attention.

Gwen has dreams which are disturbing and turn out to be reality where she has premonitions of friends and her brother being captured by a serial killer. Finney is the victim of bullies but is protected by his friend, Robin, who is tough and fends off the bullies. Robin is later abducted and killed by the Grabber serial killer. Eventually Finney is abducted by the Grabber and he is thrown in a basement with a phone. Finney contacts ghosts of previous victims through the phone which is a supernatural element of the movie.

I\u2019m not very scared of horror movies, but this made me jump a couple times. I was on the edge.

With an amazing performance from Ethan Hawke (The Grabber) and Mason Thames (Finney), It adds to the tension built up throughout the movie. Of course, some cheap jump scares take away from the incredible acting but that doesn't detriment the rest of the movie. You really want Finney to escape. One thing that I think this movie really needed was more exploration of character. Like as an example, The Grabber has a lot of things about him that should have been explored, such as why the grabber was so afraid to show his face. I think if there was more exploration into some characters like The Grabber it would have made the movie better than it already is.

The police are no closer to catching anyone when 13-year-old Finney (Mason Thames) is abducted by the absolutely mental Ethan Hawke in his most psycho role yet. Finney awakens in a soundproof basement with no hope of escape. He then starts receiving calls from a disconnected phone by the serial killer\u2019s previous victims. Cue the scary music.This is everything a horror movie should be. It\u2019s highly tense the whole way through and the entire cast are phenomenal. This is not surprising when you cast Ethan Hawke because the man just cannot put in a bad performance. He is monstrous, terrifying and will make your skin crawl. The creepy masks only add another layer, giving him an almost animalistic characteristic. Getting child actors for a story like this will either make or break the movie and the performances of brother and sister, Finney and Gwen, played by Mason Thames and Madeleine McGraw are brilliant. Their talent shines through, they had believable chemistry with each other and they\u2019re the reason the audience will become so invested in the story.As a big horror fan I absolutely loved The Black Phone. It\u2019s everything I want in a great horror movie, expertly blending real-world horror with supernatural elements without becoming silly. It will have you on the edge of your seat, and the interactions between Thames and Hawke are genuinely frightening. It also got me good with a jump scare so extra points for that. Many horrors can particularly suffer with a messy third act but The Black Phone is strong all the way through. You can see the inspiration from other movies in there, with some scenes very much reminiscent of Stephen King, which makes sense considering it\u2019s based on a short story by Joe Hill. Director Scott Derrickson knows how to make an effective horror movie, and The Black Phone is one people will definitely remember.The Black Phone is atmospheric, stressful and the sadistic performance from Hawke will be sure to scare the sh!te out of everyone. It\u2019s not just a great horror movie, it\u2019s also an entertaining thriller you won\u2019t want to miss. Highly recommended for all the horror fans."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "You know how these kids movies are there full of unnecessary swearing and give off cringe vibes, this movie isn\u2019t gonna win any awards but is solid also I can\u2019t remember a single characters name besides Finnie who is the main character."}], "recommendations": ["the_others", "insidious_chapter_3", "the_woman_in_black", "the_babadook", "the_conjuring_2", "ouija_origin_of_evil", "lights_out", "it", "candyman", "the_conjuring_the_devil_made_me_do_it", "the_conjuring", "vacancy", "the_invisible_man", "the_sixth_sense", "a_walk_among_the_tombstones", "it_follows", "scary_stories_to_tell_in_the_dark", "sinister_2", "orphan", "the_ring", "insidious_chapter_2", "ready_or_not", "the_fly", "the_prodigy", "run"]}
