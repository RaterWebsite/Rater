Aside from that, 'Precious Cargo' is poor in almost every area.Mark-Paul Gosselaar is very much the lead actor, Bruce Willis barely features at all; and when he does, it seems he didn't give a toss about this production - I'm not usually one to say an actor is supposedly phoning it in, but Willis in this... oof. Gosselaar, for his part, is average. As are the rest of the cast, yet I kinda liked Jenna B. Kelly's Logan.This attempts action, comedy and romance - none of which pay off unfortunately. The action is OK, though the comedy is extremely forced but not helped by lame dialogue. As for the love story, there is far too much - to quote the film itself - \"sappy **** in this. 100% action was needed.I will say I appreciate that there is at least a male and a female character, both appear a large amount, that don't end up getting together, instead remaining friends. That's unusual with this sorta film. The score is actually alright, too. It also, unexpectedly, includes a blooper reel in the end credits.Improved writing and acting could've made this work, if only on a minorly serviceable level."}], "recommendations": ["collide", "extraction", "survivor", "spenser_confidential", "triple_frontier", "16_blocks", "2_guns", "the_gunman", "parker", "triple_9", "haywire", "chips", "red_notice", "wrath_of_man", "jack_ryan_shadow_recruit", "the_italian_job", "lawless", "jiu_jitsu", "baby_driver", "contraband", "keeping_up_with_the_joneses", "sabotage", "gunpowder_milkshake", "kate", "the_expendables_3"]}
