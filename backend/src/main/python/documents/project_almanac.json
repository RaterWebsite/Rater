      "text": "The concept was pretty neat, but the execution was pretty dumb.\r Before I talk about this movie, I do need to have a little mini rant about how found footage is the movie equivalent of reality television. There was one point where it was pretty cool concept and was used to make stuff that was critically acclaimed and became quick cult classics, but now it's essentially a tired and crappy concept that will never go away because \"It's cheap\", to the point where you get sick of it, and then you suddenly end up in a nightmare where everything becomes it. Much like how television had the horror of every show being reality TV because \"Reality television isn't just for celebrities anymore\", the world of cinema has the horror of every movie being found footage because \"Found Footage isn't just for horror films anymore\".\r So after getting our found footage sci-fi movie (Chronicle), and found footage sci-fi family movie (Earth to Echo), we have our found footage time travel movie. The sad thing is that I feel that this movie could have been pretty alright if they just made it about adult scientists instead of just random teenagers, since I feel like the drama and comic relief portions really hurt the film. \"Oh man, I need to ace this test, better use the time machine!\" \"I need to get a girl friend, better use the time machine!\" \"Let's use the time machine to go to a party!\", it feels less like a plot to a movie and more like some lost plot of an episode of a crappy Disney Channel sitcom, but with random edge sprinkled everywhere just to target the MTV movie goer audience. Seriously, if it wasn't for the found footage elements, post production effects, guns and unknown actors, it could have probably passed as a dumb Disney Channel movie, which is kind ironic when this has similar elements from the just as crappy Minutemen movie, to the point where it seems like they just took the script of that movie and just changed a few things.\r One thing that definitely ruins this movie are the characters, like any found footage movie, they're **** and like any movie with teenagers, you can only really relate with them if you're a teenager at the same exact time, too bad I'm not a teenager anymore. That is always the biggest issue with movies that cater directly towards teens, unless you have good writing and everything, it will be unappealing to anyone who isn't a teenager around this time, and after about a couple years until the new teenagers come, it will already be dated and unenjoyable.\r So what's good about this movie? I guess parts of the story and concept were pretty cool, and there were some parts that make it look like it could have been a pretty nice film if you give it more effort, rewrote it and of course, didn't make it found footage, but other than that, it's wasted potential all because some one decided to make it found footage with teenagers."

Though it may be becoming a bit of a gimmick, films like Cloverfield, Paranormal Activity and Blair Witch are positive examples of the genre done right.However, I went into Project Almanac knowing very little about the film or its plot. My heart did sink a little when I saw MTV's logo, not to mention Michael Bay's production company Platinum Dunes, pop up at the beginning, but I tried to give it a fair chance. And to confirm my anxiousness, Project Almanac appears to be an interesting but unoriginal concept disguised as a terrible, terrible film.Within its fictional narrative, how kind it was of the people who found the footage to insert a dance-pop soundtrack, slow-motion effects and unsubtle promotional consideration from Red Bull and Nokia. As it turns out, instead of all the exploration and amazing experiences that time-travel could offer, this film thinks it is best used to attend festivals, become famous and garner Instagram and Facebook followers. We also feature the most hipster time-travel device in cinematic history controlled by an iPhone!It's rare that a film is so bad it makes me angry, but I really wanted to put holes in the cinema screen on several occasions. Artless, stupid, disastrously structured and containing all the wit and intrigue of a WKD commercial, Project Almanac is the worst \"found-footage\" film ever made."

This is yet another dumb genius movie brought to us by a clueless writer and director. At some point they need to realize just how insulting such characterizations are to real smart people and that nailing this into the minds of the young and uneducated is absolutely not good for society. At the very least, make this a comedy like Back to the Future but no... this is just a monotonous mess. Teens discover a way to time travel... and like any brain dead moron, what do they do? Send themselves despite many failed experiments that proved how dangerous the attempt is to make. And what do they do with the time travel? Well of course... the most important thing in life is to go back to high school and humiliate a bully who picked on you... and go watch a decade old concert.\r Stupid movie all around for people with very low to no intelligence to speak of."

This movie may show how simple it is to make a time machine, but they started almost already with a time machine. It only needed a few modifications and BAM, time travel. I could agree with others about the love story in the movie, but it wasn't a bad story. Just not a lot work put into it. What the kids did with the time machine was expected and predictable. Kids try to cheat the system and have a wonderful time partying. What can you expect? They are just mere high school kids. Don't expect them to change the world historically like saving Abe Lincoln or preventing WW2. That would just be pointless and boring.

It was also very predictable, with  foreshadowing every major event.  The major reason why I disliked this movie is because of a huuuuge flaw in logic.  In the last ten minutes of the movie, the protagonist uses the time machine to go back in time.  While in the past, the protagonist meets his father and DESTROYS THE TIME MACHINE.  A normal person watched this and thinks the whole problem is over.  However, this creates a time paradox.  With the time machine destroyed before the protagonist can discover it, the protagonist never finds the time machine.  With him never finding the time machine, he never goes back in time to destroy the time machine.  With the time machine not being destroyed, the protagonist finds the machine, follows the story line, and destroys the time machine."

Year after year you get the same formal of found footage movie genre and that's why I wasn't looking forward to this movie, because Micheal Bay is producing it and the fact that movie didn't really get my interest as I'm into movies that get my interest before seeing it. I was originally going to review this back in February but I didn't really have enough time and I got a lot of things to review at the time. But now finally seeing the movie I got to say it isn't as bad as I imagine it would be.\r The time traveling part in the movie really dose come off fun, but they also time travel to solve their problems like if they failed a exam they can do it till they get it right, this is basically what I would do if I had time travel, and they also things I wouldn't waste time travel on like try to talk to the girl and some other stuff that I wouldn't really do. If I had time travel I would go back to the famous moment of are life time and re-life the moment that changed everything and made history, you know what I wouldn't do? use it on pointless this that wouldn't even matter.\r The character's in the movie can sometimes come off annoying, loud, funny or just stupid. I see them as my old friends I use to hang around with and we too did some stupid sh't that I think is funny even today.\r I had a lot of fun with Project Almanac.

The visual effects are wonderful and realistic, as tape from cameras doesn't always come out picture perfect, and there will be glitches, and the fact that they made the camera glitch when the time machine made the magnetic field right before it transported people was very realistic in my opinion.\r The subject of time travel is handled very well, such as altering the past affecting the future. Even though it brought to light the fact that they were actually living in the past, and knew from David's 7th birthday party home video that the time machine would eventually work (as David points out to his late father (whom died in a car crash on his 7th birthday), simply by being there). The subject of being erased from a timeline by seeing your past or future self, was, in my opinion, realistic, but, seemingly far fetched. How so? I can't really elaborate. This, despite what I just said, actually makes the movie realistic, and not just completely fictional Hollywood garbage, as Hollywood likes to pump out yearly within the genre of science fiction.\r Even though time travel as a whole is physically impossible (shouldn't we have been visited by future beings by now?), the movie handled it really well, bringing to light some very well-known theories on time travel. Now, this doesn't mean the movie was perfect. The fact that a ten-year-old camera could produce such high-quality footage is completely Hollywood content, though every found footage movie ever made had uber-high quality footage.\r Now, be honest with yourself. Would you rather see 1080p, or 144p? The answer may seem obvious, though it seems that that kind of realism is just something Hollywood directors can't grasp. The reasons that the teenagers go back in time is pretty ridiculous and selfish (somewhat), but, come on! They're teenagers! Not brilliant scientists (even though the one kid is going to MIT, he still is just 17)! I just don't see how you guys look past this.\r Overall, the movie is flawed, but is more than just a popcorn flick. You will enjoy this film if you are a sci-fi fan like me, and you also don't need any alcohol or drugs. This movie is a definite DVD purchase for me, but, what about you guys?"

There is a bunch of awful dialogue in the movie and a concert scene that goes on for far too long. I had low hopes going into this movie but I walked out disappointed. Such a shame"

This is a found footage movie and it shows the shaky cam moments are irritating and some of the more adventurous angles are awkward and detract from the experience.\rOtherwise this is a fun, fresh take on the time travel movie. The acting is serviceable and effective, but it's nothing special. The plot explores what would happen if unimaginable circumstances were foisted upon teens. In this respect it reminds me a lot of Chronicle. Some of the individual scenes are great especially the repeated attempts in Chemistry class and the sister getting back at her bully. The narrative does a good job of coherently string these scenes together coherently. Most of the characters are well developed and feel human especially the lead but excluding the sister. Even that adds to the experience as she is the one \"filming\" and takes on the silent protagonist allowing an immersion factor that is rare in film.The last third has a great sense of build and culminates in an ending that put my jaw to the floor. An even more jarring twist occurs in the credits when it is revealed that Micheal Bay produced this film. Bay touching something and it not turning to crap is the real miracle"

Nach einigen Fehlversuchen steht die Zauberbox \u2013 und dient ausschlie\u00dflich der pers\u00f6nlichen Bereicherung: Mit einem Knopfdruck entstehen schulische Erfolge, Riesen-Lottogewinne oder die ganz gro\u00dfe Liebe. Die temporalen Eskapaden vom M\u00f6chtegern-MIT-Studenten und seiner Klischeeclique sind dabei so leichtsinnig, dass bald viel mehr als nur die H\u00fctte brennt. Project \u2013 Almanac ist dank banaler Story, strohdummer Figuren sowie einem v\u00f6llig aufgesetzten Found-Footage-Stil das genaue Gegenteil anspruchsvollen Kinos und nie so klug wie Chronicle oder so vertrackt wie Butterfly Effect. Nur eine gewisse Kurzweil rettet den Teenie-Zeitreise-Thriller vorm Totalausfall."
