      "text": "I was very impressed by both of Marshall's previous films. Dog Soldiers was a very good addition to the often poorly served werewolf sub-genre and The Descent had some really good and realistic ideas for a horror film... until the cave monsters showed up and it went a bit further than necessary. Still, both were reasonably intelligent modern horror films that showed him to be a talent to watch. I saw this as a free screening due largely Marshall's other films. After seeing it, however, I really wish I had passed. It's little more than a mish-mash of much better films with little in the way of plot or character to fill in the moments between set-pieces and gratuitous moments: e.g. random topless girl, something blows up for no reason, something explodes in a cloud of blood... these occur left and right and entirely without reason or purpose. It blatantly rips off the plot from Escape from New York (a character is even named Carpenter in apparent homage), the set-up will be compared to 28 Days Later (though any \"massive viral outbreak in Britain\" plot will get that now), steals a lot of design and atmosphere from Mad Max and still manages to throw in some medieval nonsense in there as well. Fight scenes were of the terrible, overly-fast, shaky-cam, quick-cut style making them a jumbled mess and none of the effects really felt that impressive. Almost none of the plot has any semblance of sense with almost every action occurring for little to no reason and characters being encountered so randomly that the writing doesn't feel quite good enough to even be considered lazy. In all I really enjoyed most of the films this is derived from. Heck, I even enjoyed Escape from LA to a moderate degree. This, however, was a waste of time and money even as a free screening."

      "text": "\"Mama, I'm coming home.\" Those words are never spoken in \"Doomsday\", but that's because this film is more Ozzy Osbourne than Josh Groban. Eden Sinclair(Rhona Mitra) was just a wee lass when the Glasgowian face melting began, and now the Scottish expatriate is returning to the bosom, commando style. If you pardon the cannibalism, \"Doomsday\" could be a Lifetime movie, if you pardon the bloodletting and car chases, too. This would be more readily apparent had Scotland not reinvented itself as a punk rock wonderland. If Eden wasn't looking for Kane(Malcolm McDonald), who English authorities think is in possession of the antidote that can cure the second wave of infections, this secretly Scottish woman would be looking for her mom. Don't let it escape your notice that badass Eden kept the momento which tells her who she is. The whole of Scotland is under quarantine by English decree, but \"Doomsday\" could've extrapolated with less coyness and blatantly declare the U.K.'s actions as totalitarian. The movie is also hampered by sloppy music choices during the ceremonial slayings, which leads to the nihilistic barbeque. Granted, Scottish bands like Simple Minds(\"Up on the Catwalk\" might've worked) and Orange Juice(they're hopeless; too twee, and that goes for all Postcard-era bands) aren't \"Warriors(The)\"-worthy(the 1979 Walter Hill film), but there's always Franz Ferdinand(instead of Adam and the Ants). \"Doomsday\" might just another neo-holocaust movie, but at least the dead stay dead. \"Doomsday\" chooses \"I Am Dead\" over \"I Am Legend\". Eden hardly bats an eyelid as colleague after colleague are picked off by this new breed of Scots, but the team leader would probably be bawling her eyes out if she crossed paths with mom. That's her achilees heel. She's an orphan. \"Doomsday\" is a chick-flick protected by a bullet-proof genre."

Then add a heavy dose of contrived self-parody and camp and you have \"Doomsday\". This movie is absolutely dreadful. Mitra, although lovely as always, fails miserably while trying to pull off a female Snake Plissken. The usually reliable Hoskins tries to do his best with the pitiful role given him but comes up dry. The main villains are wholly unconvincing, BDSM-loving, cannabilistic carbon-copy Mad Max ripoffs while Malcolm McDowell leads a group of entirely superflous and totally useless medieval side-villains. I could drone on but honestly it's too painfully bad to try and reconvey here. I'm only giving it a solid 4 for the sheer comedic value. The excessive, cartoonish, 1970s exploitation film-style violence and gore is so delightfully bad it's good and the soundtrack is so incredibly campy and inappropriate it literally made my mouth gape wide open. I think the creators of this film started off trying to make a serious, badass post-apocalyptic movie and decided to just start goofing off halfway through filming. Definitely file this in the \"so bad it's good\" category."

I love the first 10 mins of the movie and if neil marshall had kept the quality up then I'd happily recommend this, however it falls flat after that, following the introduction of Snake Pliss.., I mean Eden Sinclair. Also medieval armor appears to be plentiful and is Scotland really that bad in that it degenerates in 28 or so years. It actually does somewhat stand up for what it's worth but when compared to Marshals previous and masterful film, The Descent it just falls flat. Also i haven't mentioned plot holes because I'm too afraid of leaving one out, there are literally dozens of them in the movie! It looks good and when it's only the charachters that aren't annoying or unintentionally hilarious talking it's really eerie (note beginning and going into Scotland) but from there it fails."

At first this seemed to stop the virus from spreading but then in 2035 the virus came back and spread across London. Luckily survivors have been found in Scotland, which means there must be a cure. And now its up to a high ranking spy called Sinclair (Emma Cleasby) to lead a group of soldiers into Scotland to find this cure. But once inside Scotland, the survivors that the soldiers encounter aren\u2019t very friendly and its not long before the group of soldiers are involved in a gory gun-fight, which leaves the viewer wondering not only if they\u2019ll find a cure but also if they\u2019ll make it out of Scotland alive.\rThe film gets you interested right from the start by introducing the virus as horrific and gory when we see an infected person with horrible skin mutations. As well as introducing the virus in a great way, Sinclair is also introduced in a great scene which shows just how well trained a spy she is. The special effects in this scene make the gun-fights seem gory and blood-filled.\rMy favourite scene in the film is the car chase at the end which is filled with comedy, action and gore. This is my favourite scene because it kept me on the edge of my seat and the special effects in this scene made the crashes look painful, realistic and explosive.\rI would recommend this film to anyone who loves gory action films with a bit of a funny side and I would rate this film 8/10."

This movie should have been illegal. I can honestly say that some of the glaring plot holes and inexplicable random circumstances were actually the high points of this movie. Not since an Uwe Boll movie has such a huge (also state funded) budget produced such a steaming mountain of manure. Think I'm being too harsh? Let me give you some highlights of the plot: 25 years is long enough to degrade to feudal society complete with competent bowmen, blacksmiths, masons, tapestry weavers, list goes on. A small percentage of the population survives, just enough to have a hundred or so to kill in random scenes. Armored personnel carriers not only do not have bullet proof glass windows, but they don't have shatter proof glass windows. Crazy bloodlusting cannibal psychos in big ole steel trucks and roadsters are scared of tiny 2008 bentleys running into them, but the same psychos are not scared of taking on guys in full high-tech military armor with big huge automatic weapons when they themselves wield boards with nails in them. This movie was just too stupid for digestion. I wanted to like it, I wanted to believe it was camp, I wanted to just enjoy the action, but there was no way possible that I could even start to get into it. Not to mention the adhd quality of the plot, it's appallingly derivative nature or the complete lack of resolution. This was vomit on cellulose and I want that hour and 45 min of my life back.

Doomsday manages to provide the same level of kitschy badass that Tarantino/Rodriguez's Grindhouse did last year, except without all the film-school hipster winking-at-the-audience with fake lost-reels and digital film grain - it's an adoring collage that does exactly what it's designed to do."

Marshall does his best again with little - and he handles it all, production, action, casting - likes he's been doin' it for longer and better than others with only three movies to their credit. Hollywood is scrambling to pick up foreign directors who can do a lot with a little. I think with this, you'll see Marshall's name on a bigger tentpole flick soon."
