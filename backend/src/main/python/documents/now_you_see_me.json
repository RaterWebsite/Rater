The sequence of events are too convenient for a heist movie, so the magic element had to be thrown in.

It's like a script that's not gone through so much as one revised draft.\r The only way to explain the cast, budget, etc. is that the film simply fell apart in production. Perhaps the emphasis was put on all the wrong aspects.\r If you like this... I can't respect you. It's wholly broken.

The four horseman have given up their whole lives to help Mark Ruffalo for no reason at all apart from being initiated into a secret society, again which they will gain nothing from.\rSo in conclusion: incredibly far-fetched and far to complicated for no reason, there was no character development and in my opinion one of the worst and most pointless movies i have seen in years\u2026."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "\"Now You See Me\" was itself a type of magic trick.

At no point did I find myself wondering \"how is this going to turn out?\" The magic has little excitement because we know that using CGI, anything is possible.

Magic is the type of entertainment best seen in person.    One cannot take magic too seriously when cameras are involved, at least I don't.    There are a couple tricks explained in the movie and like any time you find out how the trick is done, you're surprised either at its simplicity or the amount of preparation that precedes it.\r\"Now You See Me\" is a fast paced fairly light hearted tale, all the actors and actresses turning in good performances, but none are going to be serious Oscar contenders.

It's not Ocean's Eleven or Tower Heist. It's a heist movie with wow moments and magicians. Now You See Me was directed by Louis Leterrier, the filmmaker responsible for the European pop-art hit The Transporter  as well as The Incredible Hulk and the Clash of the Titans remake. The film\u2019s magician caper/heist storyline  which was engineered by Boaz Yakin (Prince of Persia) and relative newcomer Edward Ricourt  works in unison with Leterrier\u2019s fine knowledge of cinematic technique. This gives rise to an interesting subtext about the enduring \u201cmagic\u201d of movies, the purpose of art as entertainment, and the heightened importance of creative integrity in an age where cynical skepticism sells. Because of that, Now You See Me isn\u2019t so much a character study  one set in the world of magicians  as Christopher Nolan\u2019s The Prestige; instead, it approaches related subject matter from a very different angle and proves equally successful in certain regards. Leterrier\u2019s film trades in the nihilism of The Prestige  in favor of hopefulness  and shows how referencing \u201cmovie magic\u201d can be captivating; that is, without either coming off as self-congratulatory or waxing nostalgic about film artistry in an on-the-nose manner.\rThat\u2019s to say: if you\u2019re interested in a suave demonstration of cinematic showmanship (no more, but no less) via a thrill-ride movie featuring devious (yet charming) magic performers, then you might want to consider giving this one a look."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "\u201cNow You See Me\u201d stars Woody Harrelson, Jesse Isenberg, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Mark Ruffalo and Isla Fisher in this film which is basically a poor imitiation of \u201cOceans Eleven\u201d.

Nevertheless, for some strange reason, it keeps the audience interested and involved although none of us were sure exactly what the circumstances were that we were witnessing..\rGood acting by all involved saves the day and earns the film a 7.5 rating but to make this film more than that is a feat even Houdini and Mandrake combined couldn\u2019t accomplish.."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "For what it's worth, it's surprisingly an interesting magic movie.

To the film's credit there were some really quite nice camera sequences and the twist at the end, whilst not entirely unpredictable considering the nature of the film was a very good one but the film as a whole felt so empty and unsatisfying.  The characters are probably the worst part of the film.  The main 4 characters were some of the blandest main characters I've seen in a long time and I felt like I couldn't connect with them at all.  They felt so stock, the kind of characters a 13 year old would try to come up with.  The film also tries to be clever in the way it executes a number of things but it just falls short completely.

Great cast, interesting plot with some twists, some fun moments, impressive illusion tricks.

If you have an ensemble cast, you need to either have them all on the same time or clearly distinguish who is good and who is bad. Hence, all characters in this film were only superficially developed, and you end up not caring about any of them.\r b) Almost nothing is explained. One of the best parts about heist films, which goes double for a film about magic, is when you get to explain everything in every little detail. This was not done. The narrative also had some gaping holes, such as the incredibly advanced technology which is used to create holograms. Never explained.\r c) The twist at the end. I'm trying not to give anything away, but that twist at the end was interchangeable with any other character. The writer obviously just got to the end and thought  I need to think of who the bad guy is going to be\", and just picked a name out of a hat. Disappointing.\r d) A very forced and unnecessary romantic interest.\r HOWEVER.\r The film was nevertheless enjoyable and entertaining, if not a bit predictable at times.

It was a great fun movie no doubt. I do not diminish anything about the film but I will say this you have to have the right mindset to thoroughly enjoy it. My only complaint is that there needed to be more development for the four horseman. (It could've used at least another 30 minutes if you ask me) because they needed more screen- time. Im not gonna give anything away but I was not all that blown away in the end. I kinda figured it out. However, great cast, great acting and I WILL see it again.

There is no need to investigate or inspect each and every twist and turn this film throws at you because there are bound to be holes. No, in fact what is best to do in order to enjoy Now You See Me is to simply sit back and take it in for what it is: pure, escapist cinema that delivers a relentlessly fun and entertaining ride that speeds by and leaves you satisfied when the credits begin to roll. Kudos to this movie for being able to stand on its own two feet in a season where every Friday is dominated by a sequel or spin off or re-make or something that is a familiar product that is sure to find an audience somewhere. Now You See Me is a completely original film in the midst of big studio fare that has the star power, the concept, and the appeal to win over those movie-goers who aren't just looking for an escape from the real world, but from the saturated sci-fi superhero adventure genres that are playing on every other screen. That is not to say I don't enjoy those kinds of movies as well and this year has been particularly good so far in terms of summer popcorn entertainment, but simply knowing going into this film that we are up for a fun ride that takes a subject that's commonly considered nerdy, such as magic, and combines it with the formula of a heist film to create something imaginative and fresh is indeed refreshing. Though there are certainly plot holes to be picked apart once people have the ability to re-watch the film several times, upon first viewing this is nothing more than a caper of a good time that has an incredibly strong cast each member of which is doing what they do best, churning out some solid and genuine laughs while balancing the never-serious tone with a fair amount of action and mystery that is compelling and keeps you guessing until the very end.\r read the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com"}, {"rating": "6", "text": "I enjoyed the concept of the movie.
