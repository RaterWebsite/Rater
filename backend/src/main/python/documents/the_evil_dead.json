      "text": "Nauseating and amusing in equal measure, \"Evil Dead\" is one horror movie that easily obtains its cult status, managing to surpass even your wildest imagination of gore and visceral violence. This is the first installment of the popular Evil Dead trilogy  a low-budget, B-grade gore-fest horror film with the Stephen King quote-tagline: \"the ultimate experience in grueling terror.\" A thinly scripted screenplay becomes a kaleidoscope of skewed camera angles and energetic panache under Raimi\u2019s remarkably assured guidance and direction. His debut might be short on budget, but it\u2019s hardly bereft of ideas or spirit.\r Five Michigan State University students spend the weekend in a remote Tennessee cabin, and inadvertently unleash dormant, demonic, evil spirits. In the cellar of the cabin, they find an archaeologist's tape-recording describing the contents of the Naturon Demonto (Book of the Dead). Unaware they are unleashing demonic forces  one by one  they must fight off evil spirits, and avoid becoming demoniacally possessed.\r It\u2019s obvious that Raimi takes great pleasure in all of his demented material, and he\u2019s eager to share it with an audience that\u2019s left equally shocked and thrilled. \"The Evil Dead\" is much more of a straight horror movie than its successors, but it\u2019s no less fun. Heads and arms are frequently severed, but it's all done in such a fun spirit, and in a over-the-top manner that it's difficult not to grin. \"The Evil Dead\" is at times genuinely creepy, due in part to the imaginative camera-work devised by Sam Raimi, and cinematographer Tim Philo. The \"shaky cam\" (in which the camera gave us the point-of-view of the demon rushing through the woods), became a staple of the Evil Dead series. Raimi and company empty the tank of all its gore, make-up, camera, and stop-motion tricks into an unforgettable, resounding success of entrepreneurial filmmaking."

Sam Raimi did a marvelous job that with few characters, and but a small, going-to-the-dogs house, audiences witness what true fear is like, with everything around those young men turning to live demons and trying to make them one of theirs. Compared to many modern stupid, horror-free movies which happened to be considered horror films, The Evil Dead is like Godfather part 1 in horror genre"

Before settling in for the night, they come across an ancient-looking occult tome filled with dense hieroglyphics and macabre illustrations, a dagger fashioned from human bones, and a reel-to-reel tape recorder. The taped message, dictated by a professor of archaeology, describes the contents of the Sumerian \"Book of the Dead,\" filled with incantations used to bring otherworldly demons to life, giving them license to possess the living.\rMy Review\rIt has been called many things great,awesome,best horror,best zombie film, original. And all i have to say is that is a classic that both horror fans and non fans should indeed watch. This is a horror film classic and boy am i glad i saw it. This film starts off as any horror film would, in a place where none of the characters of heard about but claim to have found out from a friend,and unleash evil. This is actually no one of my favorite horror films of all time. I put this at number four . This movie stars Bruce Campbell who plays Ash who gives the best performance out of the whole cast but my second favorite actor in this film is Hal Derich as Scott. This movie is so damn bloody and brutal and great and the atmosphere of this is also pretty amazing. This film is all out fun and a really great horror film but i have one small problem the ending. You get this ending where it's in first person and im guessing something's running to Ash and he screams but you don't know what happens it just ends like that,but hey they might explain in the evil dead 2 and despite my one problem i still give it a 5 out of 5."

However, it's obvious that Sam Raimi did everything he possibly could with the small budget. The cinematography is ingenious and rivals that of Alfred Hitchcock's films in its ability to unnerve and unsettle. Also like Hitchcock, Mr. Raimi has the ability to create unbearable suspense. The movie is at once very humorous and very frightening. A lot of my friends who have seen it have dismissed it as humorous and not scary. I disagree though: it contains some truly shocking scenes and, if you suspend your disbelief and let it carry you away, it is seriously frightening."

Sam Raimi did an exceptional job making a great horror film with unique scares and some absolutely brilliant direction to create some interesting scares and amazing suspense. However the actors and dialogue seemed a bit bad, but the one weird thing with the acting was when they were all together it looked really bad but when you had someone acting by them selves on the scene they actually did a really good job. The effects haven't aged well and that may take a tint bit away from the viewing experience but overall it's a brilliant horror film. One to pick up for sure but one that when it came out would probably have been received better. I'd give it a 7.5 overall."

(I dont watch many bad films, so it doesnt say much, but still)\rI am baffled by the fairly high scores here and on IMDb, i thought this movie was neither funny nor scary at all. (Except the awfully cheap jump scares, which is just a talentless way of scaring the audience) The acting is horrendous and hammy, there is no atmospheric tension, (Halloween is the best example of how atmospheric tension should be done, that movie has barely any blood or kills, but it's 10 times more unsettling and scary than The Evil Dead) the movie scares solely rely on jump scares and gore, which is the worst kind of horror, the plot is extremely simple yet it has so many plot holes, the solution to the film's main problem is abominable, the pacing is poor and so is the structure/ outline of the story. It is cheesy, silly and poorly made, with awful acting and many filming and continuity errors.\r The only things i do have an admiration for are the good makeup and special effects considering the limited budget it had.\r This is the first of the Evil Dead Trilogy (The Evil Dead, Evil Dead II, and Army of Darkness) i've seen, and i want to watch them all, but this did not make me excited to see more."

At least not in my opinion. Still it's some old-school horror goodness that feels much more fresh than the more modern horror offerings out there today.

      "text": "Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead is a truly frustrating film to watch. Throughout the entirety of the film after the young college-age protagonists arrive at their cabin in the woods, it is impossible not yell out, \"USE THE AXE!\" or \"USE THE GUN!\" It is just one of those horror movies, I guess, where characters have weapons sitting right next to them and instead they opt to let the demon zombie continue to live and just sit right in front of them without doing anything. Nonetheless, this oddly a major part of the film's charm as a pulse pounding and thoroughly thrilling romp through the middle of nowhere while zombies possess everybody in this cabin. Luckily for them, they have the man who will become Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell) at the helm, ready to discover his true calling in life: putting zombies on ice.Providing scares from the moment this pack of morons find a spooky recording summoning demons from the Book of the Dead, Raimi's film consistently uses some exciting ways of spooking the audience and leaving us on edge. With the cryptic nature of that message being read as he shows us something coming to life under the soil, Raimi's film begins to fully realize the tension that had only been hinted at from the beginning. This hinting takes on the form of absolutely brilliant handheld point-of-view shots of something lurking outside of the cabin. Hanging about outside and whispering to Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss) to \"join us\", Raimi smartly leaves us in the dark as to what is awaiting these kids before we finally get introduced to the sinister evil bubbling underneath the floor boards of this cabin in the woods. It is a terrifying way to build suspense without tipping the film's hand and it is only a mere hint at how scary this film will become.Through explosively campy and low-budget gore and make-up, The Evil Dead keeps the mood relatively light for how dark its plot becomes, but that does not mean it is not a horror film at its core. With tense and thrilling encounters between the kids and their now possessed friends, the film constantly shows the horror of having to kill your friends to survive, while also delivering terrific zombie scares throughout. Featuring an unsettling score that is occasionally accompanied by a truly haunting heartbeat sound and liberal usage of oblique angles when the climax arrives, The Evil Dead is a film that has no problem leaving the audience sweating what is awaiting Ash around the next corner. Compared to Army of Darkness, this initial entry into the trilogy is a lot less tongue-in-cheek and that lack of one-liners is felt when the zombies are around every corner and Ash has no idea how to finish them off. It is tense, thrilling, and an edge-of-your-seat thrill ride that will leave you curling up while wondering if you need to look away or not. It is truly unbridled fun that knows it is fun, but never lets that fact obscure just how scary the film becomes.As with many horror films, The Evil Dead certainly has something going on with the women in the film, namely Cheryl. The first one to get attacked by the demons, she runs in the woods (horrible idea) and gets attacked by the trees. Holding her down, ripping her clothes off, showing us a boob, and then having a tree branch penetrate her, the film quite overtly creates a rape scene. Many horror films include vaginal or penile imagery and this film is certainly no exception as that scene demonstrates. With many horror films also killing those who have sex during the course of the film, it is certainly not far-fetched to believe the two are firmly intertwined. Playing up on the typical sensuality felt when a sex scene is in a film by draping it in blood, guts, and horror, horror films manage to make the audience even more uncomfortable. It is unsettling to watch Cheryl get attacked by the trees and it is only worsened by how vulnerable she is when the trees strip her down. It seems as though there is nowhere to go as it violates it and puts a demon inside her and that inevitability at a point when she is so vulnerable and unprotected is really what makes the scene so effectively terrifying.Scary and thrilling throughout, The Evil Dead lacks the comedic bite of Army of Darkness and with how bad the effects are, that may not be a good thing. However, Raimi plays it so light with some self-awareness about how dumb it all looks that it winds up remaining truly scary and yet not scarring. That said, it was probably a good idea to turn its sequels into horror comedies, if only because it plays so nicely into Sam Raimi's wheelhouse and skillet. However, as a more straight-up horror film, The Evil Dead delivers the goods in a fun and thoroughly spooky film."

Dated in all the ways you'd think it'd feel more modern and modern in all the ways you'd think it'd feel more dated, \"The Evil Dead\" is a complicated movie to digest in the year of our Lord 2020. You find yourself impressed with the makeup and effects, yet disappointed with the performances and music. You appreciate the film's contributions to the genre and its totally unorthodox feel, yet lament the existence and question the purpose of the infamous \"tree rape\" scene.

I loved the camera in the movie, even though the camera for me doesn't make some of the scenes scary but at times it does make it feel like you are walking in a haunted house ride, plus the makeup for the deadites (yeah I don't like that name too) makes the experience more realistically fake. And as I said before the low budget is the movie's bigger strength because there are a lot of things to be inspired by, possibly one of the best films to admire and spark a passion for film making for future movie goers to horror fanatics.

The original cabin in the woods movie has a supernatural force that seems to envelope every frame like something is always watching. Some people prefer the more comedic Evil Dead 2, which is also great, but with the small budget original everything seems more tense and atmospheric. The beautiful cinematography puts you in a state of dread, leading you up to shocking moments that can scare, nauseate, and disturb you. The claustrophobic nature of being trapped and cornered by an evil that constantly surrounds you, prays on weaknesses and vulnerability, and twists your brain into a state of fear and paranoia is conceptually brilliant. One of my favorite films, not just in Horror but in general."

It is raw, visceral, raw, funny sometimes, violent, disgusting, cunning and often clever. It is so rare to witness horror movie characters doing things that are not totally dumb. I mean they often do very clever choices, not emotional ones.The acting oscillate between okay and terrible. Actresses showcase many varied emotions. Special thanks to Betsy Baker playing as Linda which was the most remarkable performance out there.The soundtrack and soundscape is amazing and contributes, in addition to the lighting, the travelings and the first-person shots to make us dive into these horrifc visions. Danger often comes where we don't expect it, leading to scenes full of surprises. In a word : intense."

      "text": "The Evil Dead is an extreme ride into the gory side of the horror genre. Often disgusting, disturbing and shocking, the film still presents itself as fun, and not to be taken seriously. Depending on the viewer. The production design was good, and the film blatantly and proudly shows off its gory and glorious violence, although sometimes it becomes pretty cartoonish. The cinematography is also quite good. The only problem is the acting and the dialogue. The acting was a little dry and unbelievably stale, and the dialogue was pretty cheap, though there are moments where the cheapness works."
