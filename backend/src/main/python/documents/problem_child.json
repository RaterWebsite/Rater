      "text": "Problem Child is an outrageous funny 90's family-fun comedy. Micheal Oliver a crude,funny,vulgar boy giving a performance that'll give the adults and teens chuckles and laughs. And this movie is Adam Sandler's director Dennis Dugan  (Happy Gilmore), directorial debut. Dugan is one of America's worst comedy directors he is so detached to comedy instead of what a director should do hire good actors, making your visions come true! Dugan does the opposite of a good film into a bad one. Grade C+"
