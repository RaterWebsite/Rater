I did enjoyed Damon and Hedger's performances as the Grimm brothers, where they really stood out well for the characters they had to portrayed. The other performances however were okay. I also liked how many fairytale motifs were presented in such morbid conceptual scenes, but I would agree with others that the tone and dialogue felt campy, stale and out of context for something like the brothers Grimm and their fairy tales. The tone definitely felt like the film was trying to approach too many audiences but really cannot stick to one. The Brothers Grimm does not fully Live A Happily Ever After for this written review, but that does not mean it is a bad popcorn flick to rent."

      "text": "My favorite moment in \"The Brothers Grimm\" is when director Terry Gilliam seems to be poking fun at the intense farewell embrace between Boromir and Aragon during the former's death scene in \"The Fellowship of the Ring\". It's very funny. It stirred me out of my waking coma. To me, it's a great miscalculation to present the Grimm fairy tales as factual (within the diegesis), because that makes the brothers mere academics (as collectors of attempted child murder stories) rather than the fountains of imagination that they certainly were. It's a good idea to introduce the brothers as charlatans, but rather than present them as period piece ghostbusters, their occupation should be shown as a desperate means to support their fledgling writing career. A collection of enchanting fairy tales shouldn't be turned into a loud action film. \"The Brothers Grimm\" makes Gilliam's lost opportunity to bring Don Quixote to the screen seem doubly tragic."

Several of the characters made me laugh out loud without saying a word. I loved the delicious dark 'scary' scenes...the kind that used to titillate me as a kid. It's wit and humor and storybook moral and morale were wonderful. If it fell off the breathtaking punch of the Rings trilogy and the like, it was only because it was generously faithful to the whole Grimm's Fairy tale feel. I was happy it didn't try for blockbuster overamped action adrenalin rush or punch in the gut 'grit' or cloyingly sweet fluff. I had a great good time every minute that left a clean taste in the mouth. I was surprised and pleased by Damon's and Ledger's understated performances that stayed honest and well balanced within the tapestry of the movie. I'd give it 9 stars."

      "text": "Once upon a time there was a filmmaker named Terry Gilliam whose last would-be effort, a gargantuan movie epic about Don Quixote, fell prey to all manner of evil spells, wicked elves, ogres and gremlins that prevented it from ever seeing fruition...but DID provide a fascinating how-it-didn't-get-made documentary. Gilliam's film work is that of an uncompromising independent spirit who often gets big budgets but calls his shots the way he sees 'em, like it or not...with predictably variable results that range from ballsy and bracing (Brad Pitt's singularly unhinged work in 12 Monkeys, the unexpectedly downbeat finale of the kiddie fantasy Time Bandits) to almost totally unendurable (Johnny Depp's obnoxious Hunter S. Thompson in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, who spends two hours I'll never get back again making sad, miserable people he meets on his drug-addled odyssey even more sad and miserable). That's why it's a little disappointing to see Gilliam reining himself in, however slightly, for the Weinstein boys who, despite their loud pronouncements over the past decade about encouraging independent film, tend to sit on their directors (Tarantino, of course, being a rare and obvious exception) as tightly as Louis B. Mayer did on his during the 1940s. A film about the famous fairy-tale compilers and retellers Jakob and Wilhelm Grimm seems like a natural fit for Gilliam, but he's hobbled by a rather witless, pedestrian script by Ehren Kruger (whose other work, such as Arlington Road and Reindeer Games, suggests that he's a lot more comfortable dissecting present-day paranoia than from the past) that refers to classic stories ranging from Goldilocks to Snow White to Little Red Riding Hood so haphazardly and perfunctorily that you'd swear he was working off a checklist, and by title performances by Matt Damon and Heath Ledger that are completely submerged by the surroundings and spectacle. Ultimately, none of this matters. As Gilliam has repeatedly proven since Monty Python and the Holy Grail, he is and remains a dazzling visual atmospherist and stylist who does peasant squalor as compellingly as he does patrician sumptuousness. Simply put, there's nobody around who films grass, dead leaves, wood, thatching, dirt and mud more fascinatingly than Gilliam...and I'm not being sarcastic in the least; it's really hard to do! In fact, The Brothers Grimm may be the only 2005 film besides Robert Rodriguez' Sin City in which every single frame is...well, suitable for framing. (In fact, I'd even rank Gilliam slightly higher than Rodriguez in this category because The Brothers Grimm is nowhere near so computer-dependent.) This movie's amazing, sepia-dappled cinematography and design makes the fact that we'll never get to see Gilliam's Quixote film even more regrettable, but even Gilliam running at half-speed here should be enough to ensure that The Brothers Grimm, though a box office disappointment, should live happily ever after as a cult success."

And with the Brothers Grimm he almost is able to make nothing into something great with the help of two very talented actors.

      "text": "Over the course of his career, director Terry Gilliam has earned a reputation for making adventurous and greatly imaginative films. Setting his sights upon the fairytales created by the Brothers Grimm and a story of the two brothers as con artists who encounter a true fairy tale that inspires their books, it certainly seems on paper to be a perfect match. In many respects, the final product demonstrates just how at home Gilliam is at with the inventive nature of the fairy tales that instill the film with a great sense of wonder to accompany the incredibly dynamic and imaginative occurrences in the plot. Unfortunately, the film is just missing that it factor. It has everything there, but lacks that defining quality to make this another classic from Gilliam. Instead, it winds up being nothing more than a typical modern day blockbuster that wildly disappoints.This missing factor is really what drives the film into feeling incredibly typical of mid-2000s Hollywood. In his best works, Gilliam's films have a few qualities to really define them as excellent adventure romps or imaginative explorations of the world. This defining quality is a great flow. With a light touch, Gilliam's films flow by nicely, never leaving you time to really notice the insanity on display and instead allow yourself to get swept up in the magical whimsy of the film. By the end, the worlds he creates are brimming with life, having scooped up the viewer and dropped them into this magical world of imagination. In The Brothers Grimm, however, every cog in the wheel is visible. Every imperfection. Every detail. Every bit is noticeable and the whimsical nature of the events is ruined. The sense of wonder is dispensed in the name of hitting every beat with no flow or sense of natural progression. Instead, it is an outline in film form with no connecting thread to make it all work. It is a Terry Gilliam that feels like an imitation of old school Gilliam, lacking the heart or grace with which he makes his films. Possessing every detail that a Gilliam film would have a decade prior, but lacking the purpose and wonder, The Brothers Grimm is a stiff production.This stiff nature is reflected in the comedy, which is never less than clunky. Matt Damon and Heath Ledger are a joy to watch in their respective roles as the Brothers Grimm, but the lack of flow and heart provided by Gilliam finds its way to the script and dialogue. In his best works, any one-liners would work because they are simply arising naturally in the course of the dialogue. Here, it feels as if there is an emphasis on the comedy or an extra bit of punctuation added on that makes it feel tacked on and greatly unnatural. Immediately after any scene where a telegraphed joke falls flat or elicits a small amount of air to escape from your nose, you can feel Gilliam sitting in the seat next to you saying that he thought that part was hysterical. It certainly can be a funny film at times, but just as with its plot, the film's humor is often clunky and forced.With regard to the story, the film is certainly mixed. Its sibling relationship is nice, but obvious. Setting it up with the two fighting as young boys when Jake (Ledger) sells a cow for beans, leaving the family with no money to heal their sister, it is always obvious how the strike will be resolved. Embracing magic and fairy tales in the world in direct opposition to the French government, the men will fight again before Will (Damon) realizes that Jake has been right all along: there is magic in the world. The story itself is a bit clunky as well with some obvious beats along the way and a shocking lack of originality. This is not a typical Gilliam film where a new and wondrous world is around every corner. There are moments like this, such as in Mercurio Cavaldi's (Peter Stormare) torture danger with cool torture devices and an orchestra to accompany the torture, but other than this one, the film is largely by-the-numbers. It is hard to hear Gilliam's voice amidst the sea of cliches and typical blockbuster events with the men being saved by conveniences (why did Will not get his throat cut), convenient and timely help, and squaring off with a comically awful Jonathan Pryce as the chief bad guy featuring a terrible French accent. Luckily for Pryce, he is not the only one with a bad accent here, as Peter Stormare is similarly comically bad with his accent. Together, they team up to create an opposing force who are demonized for not believing in fairy tales, even though Will himself does not believe in fairy tales and the duo con people by exploiting their hysterics related to fairy tales. So, by the end, it is clear that they are bad just because the film needed a bad guy, which is never true. If a film could come to fruition and reach the end without the bad guy being needed for the climax, it did not need that bad guy. The antagonist here is the Mirror Queen (Monica Bellucci), not Pryce's silly French general"

      "text": "This film is based on the tales of the Grimm Brothers, but also makes a completely fictional portrayal of the brothers who, in real life, were German poets, scholars and linguists, who dedicated themselves to collecting traditional fables from the center of Europe. So the first step in understanding the film is to realize, from the outset, that its pure fiction, based on the mere existence of these two brothers. Here, they're two gamblers, who make money cheating the villagers, casting out witches and demons that don't exist. So their first reaction, when they're called upon to investigate a truly magical phenomenon in which several girls have disappeared, is of disbelief, thinking that they're dealing with an elaborate scold.The screenplay is clever, in the way it approaches Grimm's fairy tales and rebuilds them, but it lost from the middle, with some ideas and options looking absurd. Equally positive was the performance of Matt Damon and Heath Ledger in the lead roles. The two actors are versatile, strong and worked well together. However, the same cannot be said of Lena Headey, who seemed to me a bit artificial and clich\u00e9. Peter Stormare is the most humorous actor and the most remarkable moments of humor are made by his character, an Italian torturer at the service of Napoleonic officials. Jonathan Pryce is the French general and was perfectly capable of becoming contemptible. Good costumes and sets, clever cinematography, good use of colors and light and shadow games make the film visually appealing and beautiful.So, this movie is good and has several quality values. But the flaws in the story, the several moments when the plot is lost and becomes idiotic, overturn the attempts of this film to become truly iconic."

The production design is fabulous and I love towns and rooms and sets built. The costumes are off-putting to say the least but there is a gross fantastical aspect about them that fits into the world. The major plus for The Brothers Grimm though is the leads in Matt Damon and Heath Ledger. These guys pop and are so likable and add so much to the story, they almost save the film alone. This is also a case of a brilliant director who had no limits and had all the money he wanted. It really shows and the film was a complete mess because of it. The cinematography was awful, the script was so clogged and plot hole filled I was being driven crazy, and the side characters were so annoying and awful I can't help but entirely blame Gillian. This film had so much potential its insane and there are some really cool things to take inspiration from but at the end of the day its just mediocre."
