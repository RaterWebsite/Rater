      "text": "A movie that excels where most other war movies fail.Its been such a long time since I last saw a war movie that nailed accuracy without being too technical so well. The visual and sound effects are incredible. The movie keeps you on your toes, and I personally found it very entertaining. The fact that I am very interested in WW2 and that I am a Naval Architect probably affect my view of this movie, but thats why this is simply my opinion. However, I think that this movie is one of the best examples of naval warfare from ww2 out there. The ship dynamics, maneouvres and the human interactions on board are magnificent. My only complaint would probably be the cheesy German U-Boat commander intercepting their radio channel and howling like a wolf. The rest of the movie is very very realistic and you can see that a lot of research and experts collaborated to produce a movie with an outstanding quality. This movie will probably receive bad critics from people who are just not interested in a Naval Warfare, or that want something more fictional like Midway, but nobody can deny that this is an extremely well made movie with a few Hollywood moments that remind us that this is still a movie based on a novel.A must watch if you like WW2."

If in the TV miniseries the war was little more than a pretext to deal with ethical and existential issues (including the interviews with survivors: is Hobbes really right when he defines the human condition a pan-bellicism regardless of weapons?), vice versa here there are expensive battle in CGI and a pious, God-fearing, perhaps bigoted single protagonist (\"Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever\", Hebrews 13:8): \"Fury\" + \"The Good Shepherd\".

Most of the film's 90 minutes has him slinging commands to his crew, as they try to outmaneuver the destructive Nazi U-boats. Even though the dialogue is full of sailing commands and jargon, writer Tom Hanks has made sure that the tactics and intentions are clear. Hanks the actor creates a character of dedication and determination. Director Aaron Schneider has kept the tension taut and makes the actions feel almost claustrophobic, even though it's set on the high seas (which often look obviously CGI). Even if you're not a fan of war movies, this one is well crafted and involving."

When convient, the director of cinematography had the internal shots actually bobbing, but otherwise, even during massive chop the crew were perfectly stationary.  Also when convienent, the crew on the deck had water on their face, which means that in only one scene when the Captain (Hanks) was on the main deck, was that true.  The rest of time everyone was perfectly dry regardless of the waves they were cutting through.The main problem with this is that it is CGI, directed by people that have no idea of naval reality (have never been on a ship of any kind), but are experts on jargon and spectacle.  Even the CGI begins to fail by the middle of movie, and everything decends into a trope filled action movie.  So many shills convinced me this was great, and I believed them.  Sony has a lot to be ashamed of with this and TLOU2 false YT claims.  They have lost a lot of honor (face)."

      "text": "Greyhound was a movie that flew under a lot of people's \"radar\". I did watch the initial trailer and I admit I was not really that impressed. However, with the coronavirus shutting down every cinema and theatre, Greyhound was instead put out on Apple's streaming service which I honestly believe was for the best. The basic synopsis is \"U.S. Navy Cmdr. Ernest Krause (Tom Hanks) is assigned to lead an Allied convoy across the Atlantic during World War II. His convoy, however, is pursued by German U-boats\". Greyhound is directed by Aaron Schneider, no clue on him, with a screenplay by Tom Hanks who is also the main star. Tom Hanks has written screenplays before but those were comedies and \"Greyhound\" however is a more serious movie. So I was mildly interested to see what Tom Hanks would produce. Starting with the praises, after watching the movie, I really appreciated the fast pacing of the movie. A fair amount of people might think of this as a negative but I personally believe this worked in the movies favor. There are constantly dangerous encounters for the Greyhound and situations that keep as the audience invested. The action scenes are thrilling to watch even though its just boats shooting at U-boats. I also love the sound design in this movie. Every missile shot feels big, every gunshot is loud and the torpedos flying underwater has an unsettling sound that feels like a ticking time bomb. The effects are also pretty good though noticeably CGI but not to the point that it ruins the movie. The music score does its job in building tension even though it does overuse a lot of the same honking noise every time.A thing I wasn't expecting with the movie was the really realistic take on how these ships are operated during a war. Seeing how the soldiers operated on these warships was very intriguing for someone like me who isn't a serious history buff. The dialogue was very convincingly realistic and I am glad they didn't shy away from the fact that people of African-American Ethnicity were mostly just messed attendants. However, realism also creates some problems as well. Nearly every dialogue in this movie involves some jargon and for the most part the audience would be able to comprehend what they were talking about. Nevertheless, there are a fair amount of dialogue that just feels really confusing to non-army technical people which is a majority of the audience. While I did praise the movie for its realistic take, there is a certain thing in this movie that just kind of took me out of the movie. Throughout, the second half of the movie, the Germans for some reason find the radio frequency and just taunt the Greyhound for no reason except being an over the top villain. It just tears me away from the realism of the movie as it just feels incredibly stupid and not believable whatsoever. This movie also goes through a sort of \"Dunkirk\" way of storytelling which is focusing on the scenario these people are in rather than developing the characters. This worked for Dunkirk but it didn't really work as well here. The film begins setting up Ernest Krause (Tom Hanks) by having him ask Evelyn Frechette (Elisabeth Shue) for marriage to give him some backstory but it doesn't really amount to anything by the end of the movie. Ernest Krause is a such a straight-up military man that it makes him a very boring protagonist to watch. It worked in Dunkirk as we can see the main character's personality and their struggle for survival. In Greyhound, however, a majority of the characters are very lacking in any personality which makes it less interesting to watch when they are talking. Additionally, there isn't really any dramatic moments that happen in the movie. It justs \"the U-boat has appeared!\" and \"the U-boat is gone!\" for a majority of the movie with some missile shooting. It does this for 90 minutes and then the movie ends.  Once the movie ended, I didn't really retain any memorable moments from the movie and just had an \"okay\" reaction.Overall, the movie is all right. The movie succeeds in giving a tense submarine-thriller showing the ins and out of sea warfare that is interesting to watch and engaging enough to keep watching. The enjoyment will come from seeing how the Greyhound sailors deal with the life-threatening situation. It doesn't have compelling characters or story but it does what it aims to do right and that is good enough."

      "text": "7.5 Entertaining look into WW2 Naval warfareGreyhound is a film I really enjoyed, it has great pacing and is a thrill ride from pretty much beginning to end.  Tom Hanks is great and really carries the film.  The focus is really on his character and the internal struggle with doubt and the responsibility he feels for the safety of his ship and the ones he is tasked with protecting across the Atlantic.  Character development of Captain Krause(Tome Hanks) and the supporting roles are lack luster but this is really my only complaint with the film. I feel the films main goal is to convey the intensity and minuscule room for error in the heat of these naval battles in a realistic way. I think it exceeds in this and it was nice how real it felt with all the appropriate naval jargon being thrown around.  Too often with Hollywood they feel they have to dumb down the dialogue for the audience and it was nice to see that wasn't the case here. The film was an intense 90 minute look into what it might have been like to be one of these brave men of the Navy we owe so much to.  Greyhound does rely heavily on CGI and while I am not usually a fan of this, for me it really didn't take away from my enjoyment this time. I recommend this one for anyone with even a slight interest in WW2."

      "text": "Good bordering great is how i would sum up Greyhound. The movie has its shortcomings but overall the positives greatly outweigh the negatives. First off, unlike a lot of modern day movies Greyhound doesnt try to include an overly personal interest story at its core but rather it just displays the struggle of merchant convoys in the atlantic during a pivotal time during ww2, the battle of the atlantic. Its gripping from the day we first see Hanks on the ship and doesnt let you go until they are being sent off again without going over the top and leave little breathing space. Submarine warfare was one of technical devices, a game of cat and mouse(and luck) and this movie does a great job in displaying that. Its not about a single hero heroic soldier taking on the evil nazis. and thats another thing, other than those stupid radio broadcasts from the german sub, this movie luckily doesnt go down the \"evil\" nazi route. Theyre also just soldiers doing their duty. The visuals are great without only a few blemishes to tarnish the good picture but those I can just overlook. Where the movie does lack is the realism in the way the german subs behave. Given that this is set after the entry of the US in WW2 germans were no longer using their deck guns let alone when a destroyer was in gun range. A german sub would never ever surface inside a convoy unless they had to due to damage, subs didnt fight destroyers or escorts, they ran from them. The list goes on and on. Funny enough, the destroyer part of things does seem quite accurate. But this will not a major gripe for most movie goers i assume as the topic is somewhat specialized and the average in a cinema wont know a lot about submarine tactics. Overall, its no Band of Brothers, the Pacific, Saving private Ryan etc, but its a good movie nonetheless."

      "text": "A fine WW2 thriller that doesn't fool around and gets to work immediately. That's probably the most pregnant defining quality of Greyhound as it, led by a wonderful Tom Hanks, keeps you on your toes and provides ample thrills for anyone who likes WW2 stories about convoy duty, marine adventure, and the spirit of the Allies. A very good late-night watch with your chums. TN."

      "text": "By far the best movie of 2020 and one of the best \"war movies\". The \"Greyhound\" is as free as possible from Hollywood clich\u00e9s, from vulgar melodramatic \"characters development\", fake moralizing and grotesque action scenes. And this is paradoxical, since the entire film is a continuous action that \"grabs\" and does not let you to the end. This is because the \"Greyhound\" strives for maximum truthfulness, does not speculate with pretentious phrases, does not seek to \"squeeze a tear\" from an audience with melodramatic scenes and does not moralize. We see a sea convoy across the Atlantic through the eyes of a destroyer captain during an attack on the convoy by a \"wolf pack\" of German submarines. We witness the burden and loneliness of power experienced by the commander when making decisions - is it worth to save the crew of a sunken ship, or to leave them to certain death in cold waters and rush to protect other ships from the enemy? How to dodge torpedoes? Should the radio silence be broken? How to outmaneuver a submarine? Sleepless days, lack of air support, feet trampled in boots to blood, numerous small and important decisions that entail consequences, including lost of human lives, put pressure on the captain, burdening him with a load that he cannot and should not share with anyone. At the same time, the captain of the \"Greyhound\" does not hate the enemy, he is a Christian who overcomes his fear and burden of loneliness in power by entrusting himself to God, relying on Him. Captain of the \"Greyhound\" is a \"good shepherd\", a shepherd dog, protecting his \"herd\" of ships from the \"wolf pack\" of submarines. The film is attentive to details and very realistic, it is devoid of sentimentalism, but at the same time, it is extremely emotional, seeking to influence the audience not by dialogues, but by what is happening on the screen, small details without words. No propaganda or false moralizing, just a commander doing what he must and a team whose lives depend on his decisions. 9 out of 10."

Despite having epic action and compelling set pieces along with nice cinematography, there isn\u2019t much more than that. Tom Hanks is great, but his character isn\u2019t. There\u2019s not really any substance beyond \u2018looking cool\u2019, but at the same time, it wasn\u2019t really aiming for that. It was aiming to take the audience on a journey into the middle of the Atlantic during WWII, and as far as that goes, it succeeds with flying colours."
