      "text": "James Wan sets up a few good scares to go along with the uneasy atmosphere here. I don't know what it is but he apparently likes using dead, creepy old ladies in his horror movies. To go along with the scary looking old lady there are plenty of unsettling ventriloquist dummies around. Both bring quite a few good scares thanks to how unpleasant they all look.\r The story itself isn't too bad. I just wish it was a little more fleshed out. The characters in the small town are quite interesting, each of them with their own unique quirks. It's a shame we get to watch them make so many dumb decisions. Overall I just wanted more from both aspects. Honestly had this have been a TV show where we could have spent more time in it's unique setting and learned more about it's characters I would have loved that. As it stands the whole thing feels like there could have been more going on. I just wish there was more to the mystery at hand.\r If you're looking for some good scares then yeah you should check this out. It fails to deliver fully on it's unique story and characters, but still provides some decent frights. It might not stick with you long, but James Wan once again makes one of the better horror flicks I've watched. So if you're looking for some decent scares then pick this one up. There are plenty of creepy ventriloquist dummies and one terrifying old lady who are ready to deliver. My total score for it is a 6.5/10."

Also, Mary Shaw's grave was in pristine condition, even though she had died like 50 years earlier and her headstone was covered in these weird cockleburr-type things--a setting needs realistic details, otherwise, it's just a distraction. Those \"atmospheric effects\" were like trying to watch a movie through a dang smokescreen--if you plan on watching this, invest in some good glasses."

      "text": "Pretty decent horror movie. James Wan (Saw 1) is a really good director who can really build to some great scares. Unfortunately, he's working with a pretty dumb script and scenario, and the movie can't escape its \"B-movie\" feel. The twist ending at the end is REALLY stretching it, although I'll praise it for being, at least, unique. Still, the movie itself feels a little slow at times, James Wan yet again reverts to the \"clowns are scary\" technique to scare people (they're not scary.) and there aren't really many likable characters here. Still...decent horror movie. I would have been disappointed if I saw it in a theater but it makes pretty decent DVD entertainment."

They had some great scares, and the ending was very unexpected. For people who were looking for tons of gore, your going to be dissapointed, however this ghost story will keep you covering you eyes and holding onto the person besdie you. Overall I enjoyed this film, and if anyone wants to see a decent horror film, I would suggest this one."

It's not Saw its just PRODUCERS From SAW. You get what you want in this movie, I think its totally creepy, if just see it, geesh, never seen a movie like this before, the only reason I don't give it a 10 is I don;t like endings like that. But with all the dumb movies out anymore a bunch of kiddie movies that are funny or so, or some lame idea, you got a real freak zone and still, people whine about it not being like another movie its freaky. Eyes moving I mean what more do you people want! I am not being harsh or mean i just dont' get critices or people, too much people judge movies, because its not like another movie, if you exspect a movie to be creepy or a doll like or ghostly or about dolls thats what your gonna goet if you go into the movies to see what its producers did in another movie or your soo picky then i don't know what to say. This movie is too freaky, and to creepy it was all it asked in my book, but of course the VERY best movies people hate the dumb movies people love. I mean seriously do I have to write a very lame story to make people read than a really, good idea and freaky plots and get hated. I love this movie, you all can hate it or have a big issue with it all, I didn;'t like is the ending. I don't like bad winning. But the rest RULES."

It was a big twist, but one of those silly ones that tries to make you go \"ooooh!\", unfortunately it didn't quite work that way..

      "text": "The movie could have easily taken a turn as a throwback/satire of all those old, terrible horror conventions, and it most likely would have been better if it had. Look at all the most generic aspects of the horror genre (or at least the oldest, and, now, never really used any more): a mysterious package with no sender listed; constant, inexplicable lightning and thunder that appears even though there was no previous signs of even rain falling; a weird hotel room and cemetery; a dusty, cob-web filled (and of course cavernous) theatre (which would normally have been a mansion in other cases); and of course a town lynching and the vengeful spirit that comes as a result. Not to mention horrific acting-- a must. However, unfortunately, the movie was fully meant to be taken seriously, and, as a result, was pretty much insufferable except for a few minutes of footage every now and then. The beginning was undeniably the worst part, due mostly to the atrocious pacing and poor writing that seems to have been just hastily thrown together for that scene to exist and set up the following \"plot.\" And from then on, the pacing is just as uneven throughout most of the movie until you reach the flashback-- which, by the way, was the only intriguing part of the movie, along with a few minutes that followed it-- which was paced and filmed well (or maybe it was all just relative, compared to what we just had to sit through). The pace didn't stay completely even after that for very long, but it was still much improved. The dialogue-- sorry New York Post-- WAS terrible, in all cases, and was (in my opinion) probably the main reason Wahlberg did such a bad job with the part. It's like the Star Wars Prequel Effect-- actors who have proven that they can do a good job are given horrific dialogue, and their performance is reduced exponentially. The only reason to attribute this movie a 3 is because of the minor jump-scene scares it elicited (but only on a 50% mark), cinematography which deserves a much better movie to go with it, and the fact that there were points in the movie where I was somewhat interested in what happened (though that amounts to maybe 15 minutes of screen time in a 90 minute movie). As for the \"twist\"-- well at least it was SOMEWHAT contextual to the plot, unlike the first Saw's-- which, really, wasn't a twist at all and added absolutely nothing to the movie whatsoever. However, the twist still didn't really have to much effect on the plot. And given the fact that it was such a terrible movie up to that point, and the fact that we had basically already suspended all disbelief (most likely due to brain cells shutting down)-- it wasn't terrible, just about 95% illogical. The only other thing I can say the movie had going for it, was the fact that the innovators of the splat-pack did manage to make a horror movie that didn't rely on gore, and actually built minor tension every now and then. That, and this was an incredibly tame \"R\" movie, even more so when looking at the people behind it. And Calvin H., sorry the twist wasn't great-- just because you can't see a twist coming doesn't mean it's good (especially when they don't even add much to the movie)-- in fact, if you have absolutely no idea about a twist, it's likely a bad one, since a good twist will still leave evidence along the way (and no, three seconds of cumulative footage \"explaining\" the twist does not count as laying evidence-- please go watch Shyamalan movies or, if you thought this twist was good, you might enjoy even the predictable twist in Se7en). And Norm D. (I'm on a roll here), no, you seem to be one of the few people who hasn't seen this doen a million times before, and can't seem to recognize that all the things you're saying are basically untrue. This \"freaky idea\" would barely even hold up as a Supernatural episode. And in terms of what more do we want than \"eyes moving\"? Are you serious? I'm a sixteen year old boy who has a horror fix, and I can still basically see all these things you somehow can't. I honestly hope you're a 10 year old who wants to see grown up movies (which I also would hope accounts for your atrocious writing). So for anyone actually reading this, it does work as a cheap horror fix, but I would strongly suggest other movies to help out the fix: The Descent, which is undoubtedly one of the greatest horror movies to come out in quite some time; 28 Weeks Later, one hell of an incredible thrill ride; even guilty pleasures like Hostel, which at least is well shot, pretty well acted, and at least has a smart script (or themes to it, if you'd rather). So I would generally reccommend against this movie, even to those who think it'll be scary because of the doll-- the eyes moving, head turning schtick gets old pretty quickly, sicne that's about the only gimmick they employ. Honestly, I had realized this was going to suck utterly, but I had expected some good scares given the premise. Unfortunately, no."

If you have ever seen the chucky films like myself and laughed your ass off at them cause they were so stupid then this one might open your eyes another ways. The film follows A man who gets a puppet as a gift    and it ends up killing his wife and the whole film is him trying to prove his innocence that he did not kill his wife along with discovering the dark secrets of the puppet and its owner. The movie is called Dead Silence as the puppet only strikes when there is total quiet, which works VERY well with the suspense of the film. Like the saw film it ties most things up at the end with a very UNEXPECTED twist.Fans of SAW and those who want a decent version of CHUCKY should like this filmPeople scared of PUPPETS,CLOWNS and OLD SCARY WOMEN should lock their doors and try not to think about the movie at all"

      "text": "This film takes advantage of the world of ventriloquism to make horror. It is not a totally new idea, but it worked quite well, if we want to believe that a famous ventriloquist was in fact the reason why a city lived its golden era, as the film ends up suggesting.The script begins with the mysterious death of a woman shortly after receiving a box at her home, without address, containing an old ventriloquist doll. While the police regards him as a suspect, her husband returns to his father's house, in a city where there is an old legend about ventriloquist dolls, in which they are truly evil. It's not a complicated story, and it has a lot of logic flaws and unbelievable situations, but it works decently if we don't start thinking too much about it.The cast is led by Ryan Kwanten, and he is good enough for the job. Donnie Wahlberg also makes a very good contribution, although his character looks really stupid. Bob Gunton and Laura Regan helped a lot in what was possible, but there was little for them to do here. Judith Roberts was quite good in her role, but it was not the right movie for her to shine.Directed by James Wan, director with very solid predicates in the horror genre, the film does not fail to build a pleasant tension and plays quite well with the mystery. Despite this, it is not scary enough and many of the scares are predictable or rudimentary. Elegant cinematography, somber at the right times, and good visual and sound effects were important elements in the construction of dramatic tension."
