The devil is in the details and the Underworld series spins a unique web of bloodlines, ancient traditions and old world betrayals. There's a lot in this franchise to sink your teeth into, if you so wish. This first Underworld effort is probably outdone by it's excellent sequel, if only by slim margin. Nether-the-less, the acting is great, the art design and effects are spot on and the action scenes are impressive. The movie has a great balance. Basically speaking, Underworld is the perfect start for a much underrated franchise."

There is plenty of Action going on and while it gets a little dull in the slower parts it picks up towards the end.

I gave this film 1 because the special effects were good, but if it were for the plot, script, acting or action then this would have recieved nothing, perhaps even a minus if that were possible! oh and as for the comparisons to the matrix, well the only similarities were that they were both shown in a cinema."

The effects and fight scenes might have been decent a few years ago, but they simply don't hold up today. What's more, the film is far too long - the story (what little there is) could have been told in half the time. The only saving graces are Bill Nighy and Michael Sheen, who both have an immense amount of fun as the leaders of the vampires and werewolves respectively, but don't get enough screen time to redeem the film. Underworld plays like it's trying to be somewhere between the Matrix and Blade, but in fact it's a poor imitation of both."

      "text": "I was wrong. After watching Underworld again, I came to realise that not only is it the worst of the series, it has no redeeming features at all. It's garbage in the purest sense of the word. The acting is wooden with the best performances being ones from bit characters like Bill Nighy's Viktor and Michael Sheen's Lucian (probably why Rise of the Lycans is much more enjoyable). Kate Beckinsale lumbers from scene to scene in a sort of daze, spouting words with no semblance of feeling or thought. I can only imagine its because she is having a severe allergic reaction to the amount of leather shes wearing. Scott Speedman is tragically miscast as Michael not because he doesn't fit the character but because he is just a terrible actor. However the acting is just the beginning. Underworld is poorly directed with almost every scene being both poorly shot, framed and edited with them feeling like they are being rammed down your throat instead of neatly wrapped for your enjoyment. The main problem with the direction (by Len Wiseman) is that it is so remarkably unimaginative. It pushes no boundaries and doesn't try which carries over into the editing, sound mixing and everything else related to the film. The man behind the wheel should at least be able to steer. Len Wiseman got into the drivers seat drunk and everyone in the car held on for dear life.Summing up, its just rubbish."

      "text": "Vampire movies exist by the hundreds. I think there is hardly a monster capable of being more seductive and appealing than the vampire. Likewise, there is hardly a rival more suitable for those blood drinkers than the werewolf. This film will explore these and create an alternative story for both monsters that, here, have a common origin and are destined to hate each other.The main character is Selene, a warrior vampire who devoted hundreds of years to an eternal war with werewolves, called Lycans (if anyone knows the difference between a Lycan and a werewolf, please tell me). After a routine mission, she discovers that there is a large group of Lycans who can threaten vampires. Ignored by the vampire leader, she decides to prove that she is right and the danger is real, and wakes up the mighty Viktor, an elder vampire. But Selene's inquiries will prove the threat is more serious than she imagined and all loyalties, inside and outside the vampire clan, are at stake.This film is an action blockbuster loaded with leather, bullets, blood and testosterone, more than suitable for teenagers full of bouncing hormones. For me, it worked well but it is far from being something I would pay to see at the theater. It was directed by Len Wiseman, who we already know from \"Live Free or Die Hard\". He is a satisfactory director and seems to like dark material. I believe he was very inspired by \"Matrix\", if we take into account the leather clothes, hard-rock style and, above all, the opening scene in the subway, with hundreds of bullets fired without injuring anyone but destroying all the station, in a moment of unrealistic and absurd action. Believing that mortals live totally unaware to such blatant immortals is, at the very least, impossible. The story becomes more complex with the revelation of the past of the two clans and the creation of a myth that is never truly well explained, but supports the rest of the film.The cast is full of well-known names and is led by Kate Beckinsale, in a role that places her, more or less, between a Lara Kroft and a porn dominatrix. She's attractive but doesn't give us much more than her own body and a hot voice. Scott Speedman is stupid and doesn't seem to know how he got here, besides there is no chemistry between him and Beckinsale for both of them to be a credible romantic couple. Shane Brolly is fine, but not extraordinary and there are a lot of actors who only show up a little without adding some significant to the film, such as Wentworth Miller, Kevin Grevioux and Sophia Myles (she seems to have been included in the cast just to please the male audience who prefers a blonde over a brunette). But not everything is so decadent! Michael Sheen is excellent, being the most outstanding actor in the film and the one that gives us more solid work. Although I prefer to see him in dramatic films like \"Frost/Nixon\" or \"The Queen\", he is good at this kind of character and would come, years after this film, to do something like this when he play Aro Volturi in \"Twillight\" saga. Likewise, we must see and applaud Bill Nighy's good work, with his unique voice and diction. He gave his character an air of elegant aristocratic sadism.Technically, it is a dark film, loaded with action, bullets, leather, blood and very dark. Without a single scene with the sun or some bright colour, it is truly a dark film... I already said that? Gothic to the core, it has a nebulous and gloomy cinematography that, however, works well. Not being a romantic film, it has some hot scenes that, however, show nothing much. Even Beckinsale's ass always looks in her tights. However, sex is everywhere in the vampire world and that vampire mansion looks almost like a decadent brothel. The scenes of violence are also everywhere, but they sound so fake that even when a head is cut in half, we don't feel anything about it."

      "rating": "6",
      "text": "Based on her role selections in the 2000s, I feel it is fair to conclude that Kate Beckinsale exclusively sought out roles that had her wearing black spandex while shooting mythical beasts. Underworld certainly fits that bill and really started this trend for Beckinsale. In this film, she is a vampire who kills lycans (werewolves) for a living, as part of the long war between the two factions. Directed by Beckinsale's husband as of 2004, Len Wiseman, and co-starring her partner as of 2003, Michael Sheen, Underworld is cited as the film where she left Sheen for Wiseman. Oddly enough, she was the one who wanted Sheen to be cast in the film. Awkward. That aside, however, Underworld is a thoroughly entertaining fantasy shoot 'em up with great mythology and stylish action sequences that make up for its lesser elements.With great mythology and background to the issues afflicting the vampires and the werewolves in this world, Underworld really takes its time and develops the hatred. Throughout, the film manages to nimbly switch between the two sides and have the audience develop sympathy for both sides. As many critics cited upon its release in 2003, this is really the film's greatest asset. Its success with it is up for debate, but what is not up for debate is the depth and scope of its mythology and how truly intriguing it shapes up to be. By the end of the film, it truly becomes a shame that all of the sequels are seen as being so bad, because spending more time in this world would be a truly captivating exercise.Another strength here is the action. The whole film is seemingly shot through a blue filter, which is actually quite appealing and really does work with these action sequences. Cited as a rip-off of The Matrix by some for its use of trenchcoats and slow motion action scenes, Underworld's action is hardly attractive. It is also quite nonsensical with endless magazines and shootouts in public that hit nobody. This does not mean it is not slick as all get out, however. Very well shot and quite visually appealing, the action's style really hides up its blemishes nicely. In particular, there is a scene where Selene (Kate Beckinsale) spins around and shoots out the floor around her to create a hole in the floor, allowing her to drop down to the next floor. Obviously, this is very stupid. Yet, it does look very good.In terms of acting, it can be quite hammy. However, who does not want to see Beckinsale, Michael Sheen, and Bill Nighy, ham it up? Plus, their characters are actually quite good, allowing them to have a lot to chew on in the roles. In particular, the character of Viktor, played by Nighy, is great. An elder vampire who is awoken by Selene upon the discovery of a conspiracy within their midst, Viktor is a towering figure. Instilling terror and fear wherever he goes, Viktor is a truly menacing vampire and Nighy captures this terrifically. Sheen was also very good in his role as Lucien, a werewolf. The leader of the werewolves, Sheen is both strict, tyrannical, and highly sympathetic in his role, especially once we begin to learn more-and-more about him. Quite well-written, Sheen really makes the most of the role from an emotional standpoint.On the negative, Underworld is simply absurd. As mentioned before, it is quite fantastical with a lot of action movie cliches. With missed shots abounding, the film's mythology saves it from becoming just a run-of-the-mill action movie, but that does mean the film does not still come close to being the furthest thing from original. It compounds this problem with a terrible romance element between Selene and Michael (Scott Speedman). Unconvincing and greatly rushed, the romance merely distracts from the plot, rather than helping advance it. For many Hollywood action movies, this is a problem and it is certainly one in Underworld.Entertaining and easy to digest, Underworld is hardly the most challenging film ever released. However, it is a fun watch with great mythology that proves to be an worthy  diversion and popcorn film."

In the underworld of vampires and werewolves, Kate Beckinsale as Selene is a vampire Death Dealer who is hunting Lycans and it turns out that Michael Corvin is who is being targeted by them. After been bitten by a Lycan, Selene must decide whether to do her duty and kill him or go against her clan and save him. Um, okay. Um. To be honest, I'm not a big fan. I mean it was a good film for the franchise but it gets tad boring really fast. Let me get this straight. On my first watch I was thinking that this is a same thing as Blade starring Wesley Snipes where Blade battles the vampires who were sucking blood from people and then I actually find this to be same exact thing with this time with vampires and werewolves and I thought I find it to be good but didn't and today I thought about watching it again to give it another chance and I still finding it tedious and confusing but it's not a bad film by any means. I remember back in the day that Bill Nighy is good in this as Viktor. So after that I'd still find Underworld to be a tedious shoot 'em up action horror film for which I didn't find it to be scary and horrifying. So after me watching the first Underworld I was thinking of watching the second Underworld film thinking that it'll be good as the first but I'm not quite sure so I'll have to wait and see, so stay tuned for that.
