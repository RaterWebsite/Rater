      "text": "VERY BAD this new installment of The Conjuring Universe. All the cliches of the genre, the weeping woman turns quickly and it breaks bones, that even shows up in the trailer when the child sees her, jump cheap scares and all the same old things that people of today like, like for example everything is silent, suddenly a loud sound and she appears behind you in the shadows. TOTALLY PREDICTABLE. When the girl looks out the door I already knew it was for her doll and voila, that was it. Everything is fortuitous. The stupid shaman that is trying to be funny, the kids behaving so foolish that everyone in the room wanted to punch them, people laughed and they were angry (but that's the script's fault). The other mexican crazy lady that becomes bad and vindictive in order to finish the others, and in the end is redeemed from one moment to another because the plot says. This movie is like a Mexican fast food in the USA that you find in a corner, which is not the REAL FOOD in Mexico. It has good things and I know that there are people who like this kind of cheap fear, and there were some who got scared in the room and even shouted and covered their faces.SPOILER: In the end they kill La Llorona, that's like killing The Bogeyman, totally absurd, that's an urban legend in all Latin America, a folklore, a woman who lost her children and is walking around kidnapping others. You can't kill Baba Yaga."

      "text": "By far the strangest entry in the Conjuring Universe. The only connection it shares with the other films in that world is a brief appearance from Tony Amendola as Father Perez, who you may remember from the first Annabelle. It's a fairly insignificant tie-in however, as outside of that one small reference getting made it largely does its own self-contained thing. So if you're solely interested in watching this to ensure you don't miss out on any aspect of the bigger picture this web of interconnected horror is creating, rest assured this is an inconsequential piece of the puzzle that you won't regret skipping. Not least of all because it's not very good.This could have been a great opportunity to bring a more diverse perspective to theaters due to its use of Latin American folklore and a primarily Hispanic cast. Unfortunately, that potential was squandered by the casting of a white woman in the lead role (showing once again that mainstream Hollywood flat out does not care about women of color) and failure to use the culture in any way to distinguish the movie from your average haunted house flick. So if this was an attempt to bring some representation to cinemas, it's a pretty miserable misstep on that front.Of course it's also not very successful as a horror film either. The titular La Llorona is a particularly loathsome specter as a result of her fondness for drowning children, but Michael Chavez was unable to make her the slightest bit scary. All she ever does is predictably pop out screaming with her arms outstretched, yank people off-screen umpteen times, or simply stand in place and try to look creepy. None of which prove effective at getting the adrenaline going.There's also a weird tonal shift about halfway through. The first portion plays out in a very serious and self-respecting manner. It's not exactly \"good,\" but nowhere near as awful as its reputation would have you believe. When Raymond Cruz's character shows up however, things start to get a bit cheeky. A playful tone creeps its way in and you start noticing the appearance of jokes in what I can only assume was an effort to capture some of the campiness that made The Nun an unexpected blast. It got to the point where I literally turned to the person next to me and asked \"when did this become a comedy?\" The pacing does increase at this point, but just when it looks like it's about to go into high gear it instead abruptly ends as the ghost is defeated in an anticlimactic and unintentionally hilarious manner. It was at this point I realized just how bad and slapped together the whole experience is.This was very clearly just a test run to get Chavez ready to direct the third Conjuring. Because of that it's understandable why Wan and crew were still willing to give him the reigns in spite of how rushed and sloppy this turned out. Unfortunately for us, they missed the fact that nothing he put onscreen was able to raise so much as a single goosebump. La Llorona is a fright-free mess that feels like each of its writers had different visions and instead of coming together split the script duties down the middle, never makes satisfying use of its shared universe ties, and fails to respectfully depict the culture it's borrowing from.4.5/10"

      "text": "La Llorona, based on the Mexican folktale about a ghost who drowns children, is about a seventies case worker (played by Linda Cardellini) trying to protect her children (played by Roman Christou and Jaynee-Lynn Kinchen) from the titular ghost (played by Marisol Ramirez). Though it picks up in the last act, this movie is rather dull.Beginning exhibition is stilted. Most of the characters aren't interesting, including Cardellini's character and I usually like her work. This is a Conjuring-verse movie. The franchise has done a wonderful job with child characters and actors. Until now. When the horrible stuff starts happening, the kids are just so frustratingly unresponsive to the events around them for a good portion of the film. Only Tony Amendola as a priest has a lively performance and it's a bit part.Movie isn't really scary. Frights are predictable and often uninteresting. La llorona is a very basic ghost character and there isn't much visually interesting about her. I do give credit to whoever worked on her dress. It shifts from white to dirty black really nicely. This is how much I was bored, I was noticing color gradients.There are a few nice shots, but on a whole the cinematography is uninteresting, not to mention the lighting. This is director Michael Chaves' first feature film and it shows. It's not so much a case of being a bad director than an inexperienced one.The reason I'm not giving this a lower rating is that the final act and confrontation with La Llorona is directed a little better and a little fun at times. Raymond Cruz shows up as a healer and he has the only funny lines in the film. His methods to deal with the ghost are kind of interesting including a fun scene involving eggs. There is a transition shot that stands out because it's the best in the film.Overall in the Conjure-verse rankings, I'd put this above Annabelle and below the rest. If you're a franchise completionist, knock yourself out. I wouldn't say there is anything strong enough to deter you. As for everyone else, there are stronger horror films out there."

They're easy and cheap to produce. Frankly they studio isn't interested in making a good product. They simply give the audicence their dose of jump scares and that's it.What else can I say?

      "text": "The most horrifying installment of the Conjuring Universe, oh sorry, my bad, the most horrible one.The Curse Of La LloronaChaves is, I wish I could say, a good adapter. Since, he adapts most of the scenes from the genre itself. The originality objective is left unchecked and the director, Michael Chaves takes the blame for it. The franchise has always bugged me since the beginning. Don't get me wrong, I have been a fan of their mythology, but their flaws is something that draws me into it. They contradict themselves perpetually, their tactics fails and their philosophy lags behind. And yet, they never think of rechecking themselves. I have never seen a film take these many wrong decisions in the first ten minutes, as this one does.Craving for cheap adrenaline shots, the overridden melodrama and irrelevant slow motion takes are clearly off putting. The story searches for horrifying moments or creating jarring impact on the audience, and instead completely forgets to make sense let alone have some rhythm to nod on. Compared to The Nun, it is certainly less animated- which is usually good- but also less scary. The tricks, something you can rely upon the franchise, too is in vacancy in here.The build up of an antic is montage of up close shots of being scared and the execution too loud to catch us by surprise. Even the back story, the flashback, the gist of the film, isn't interesting. The boomerang aspect of the world is probably the best and untouched part of the film, the returning back theme, that Linda Cardellini finds herself in, from her own agency that knocks at her door to finding herself in the same spot that she accused others being at. Speaking of whom, Cardellini is the soul of the film, she whimpers as told and stands up against The Curse Of La Llorona as an improv, hold on to her and you might survive this."

      "text": "E-Value: 5Acting: 7Plot: 4Although marketed as a standalone movie, The Curse of La Llorona is actually the sixth instalment in The Conjuring Universe due to Tony Amendola reprising his role as Father Perez from 2014\u2019s Annabelle and even at one point, mentioned about his experience with the haunted doll. This movie is also a unique instalment because La Llorona, which is an evil entity from Mexican folklore, does not have anything to do with the Warrens at all in real life.Set in the year of 1973, Anna Garcia (Cardellini) is a social worker and a widow with two children, Chris and Samantha, living in Los Angeles. One day while working, she and the social service discover that Patricia Alvarez (Vel\u00e1squez) locked up her two children in a closet which she claims that she done so to protect them from La Llorona (Ramirez).Patricia\u2019s children are taken from her by the social service while she is sent to jail for alleged child abuse. After her children mysteriously died in a river, Patricia blames Anna for her indirect role in her children\u2019s death and she said La Llorona is responsible for the cause. At first, Anna does not believe until La Llorona set her sight on her next target: Anna\u2019s beloved children.To be honest, this movie is a little bit scary than the first Annabelle movie and 2018\u2019s The Nun. At times, I got freaked out during some of the jump scares. The good thing about this movie is it is a little better than those two movies but still not good enough compared to the first two Conjuring and 2017\u2019s Annabelle: Creation. Michael Chaves has done a good job as director in his directorial debut which kind of makes sense that why James Wan chose him to direct The Conjuring 3. Linda Cardellini\u2019s acting is very good but her character does not have enough development and so does many other characters in the movie.However, the plot of the movie is very underdeveloped. For example, the movie does not explain how Patricia Alvarez and her children were attached by La Llorona. How does a demonic entity from Mexico ended up in Los Angeles? It does not make sense. If Patricia and her children are from Mexico, it would have make sense that they were attached by the demon back in the old country but this is purely my speculation, not to be taken as an official lore. There was no explanation or any backstory at all to improve the plot. The only backstory in the movie is the basic history of La Llorona and that is about it.Since Michael Chaves have been selected to direct The Conjuring 3, he definitely needs to step up his game by having better writers and focus on improving the plot, screenplay, script and character development otherwise that upcoming movie will suffer a sequelitis. Last but not least, this movie would probably be better off as a standalone movie instead of being part of The Conjuring Universe."

And guess what, this movie FAILS! And here\u2019re my opinions about it. Initially, the performances are good with Linda Cardellini as Anna Garcia and her two children, Sam and Chris and there\u2019s a woman Patricia played by an actor with the same name. Their acting was the most impressive of the movie. They knew how to scream, how to weep but I wasn\u2019t impressed much with the actor of La Llorona, she should be a lot scarier than how she was in the movie. I like the make-up of La Llorona, a grey face with black tears and yellow eyes, that\u2019s a bit creepy. This movie definitely looks like a James Wan movie. James Wan had some horror masterpieces like Saw, The Conjuring and more. The cinematography, it was okay, how they shot was good, not disturbing or bad at all. I don\u2019t know if they used that much special effects and then I looked at the budget, it\u2019s $9 million, they wasted some.  You know why this movie FAILS? It\u2019s because how I measured the movie in the scare factor, from a scale from 1% to 100%, I would rate this movie 5% scary and that\u2019s the problem with horror movies nowadays, they forgot to make the movie scary, all they did was adding blood here and there, it\u2019s not scary and I wanted to see this in the theatre and then people made stupid decision to rate this R and it\u2019s a waste, just like Hellboy. Even the jumpscares they had were over and over again but none of them worked. The whole movie is totally boring, almost every part of the movie is non-horror. The Conjuring Universe is going to be one of the best horror franchises but all it takes is one substandard spin-off to make you realize just how much craft and care are needed to make these things work right. I really don\u2019t think there\u2019s a reason for this movie to exist. It\u2019s not scary or creepy, it\u2019s just so annoying that I really want to give it a 1 or 0 but nah, good acting, good cinematography as well but still, the movie really FAILS."

Poorly written and directed, with boring characters and lame technical performances. The original score was just awful as the film, nothing to save here. Do a favor to yourself and stay away from this crap."

I have watched tons of horror and sci-fi movies so not all that much surprises me as you learn to expect what's coming next ... this movie had the usual stuff, HOWEVER, the set up was pretty good .... the scene with the Hispanic mother asking the lead actress \"Have your children heard her crying\"  actually gave me goosebumps ... THIS MOVE IS FAR BETTER THAN THE CRITICS ARE SAYING ..... I would give it a least a 6.7 out of 10 ( 5 is borderline I may not watch this to the end, anything less than 5 is don't bother its kinda crappy, 6+ is it's enjoyable and worth checking out... I RECOMEND THIS MOVIE"

Jumpscares hatte. Zum Vergleich: Ein Conjuring 2 hatte auf 134 min ca. 5-6 Jumpscares und ist einer der besten Horrorfilme. Warum ich trotzdem noch ne 5 gegeben habe? Weil das Monster sehr gut aussieht und die schauspielerischen Leistungen sind okay, sodass der Film genau die Mitte trifft."

Full of jumpscares without any sense, a ghost that has no rules at all, which sometimes it's like a god and can do whatever she pleases, and sometimes it's less powerfull than the people she's trying to... I'm not completely sure what she wants because this movie doesn't even bother to explain you anything, only tries to make you jump over your seat and think: Oh my god what am I watching."

      "text": "I didn't enjoy it. AT ALL. Throughout the movies runtime all I remember doing was joking around with a friend that watched it with me because of how utterly boring the story was. It had weird choices taken by characters, a monster that makes irrational decisions that make no sense whatsoever even if you try to make it make sense, and relies only on the average jump scare to actually try and scare you. I wouldn't recommend watching it if you want to actually be scared but I definitely recommend watching it if you like laughing at movies every once in a while (I certainly enjoy watching Shark Tale every now and again). In conclusion, this feels like a money grab (although it didn't really succeed at this too) since James Wan's involvement make it possible for La Llorona to be part of the Conjuring Universe. Stupid characters, Stupid monster, Cliche... basically disappointing."

The plot is very simple and impactful although sometimes there are holes or very stupid parts that were sparable. The Llorona is aesthetically done well and scary, it's also cute that it brands people. The role of social workers, on the other hand, is wasted because it leads nowhere and they are useless for the purpose of the plotJoker."
