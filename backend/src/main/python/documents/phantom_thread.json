      "text": "The film is beautifully done and is unique. It sticks in your mind long after you leave. It's funny, dark, romantic and haunting. Paul Thomas Anderson directs, writes and for the first time in a long time, handles the cinematography which he deserves a nomination for, for the sake of recognition at least. A couple of years ago, I remember watching a Q&A of PTA and cast for Inherent Vice and a woman from the audience made a comment that PTA is \"obsessed with masculinity\" which he seemed shocked by. It seems that observation has somehow challenged him to do something more feminine. So he creates a film filled with women and only 3 main characters, two being women and one being an effeminate man who works on fashion and loves his mum. Now it is safe to say the film, like Daniel Day Lewis' character, is \"obsessed with femininity\" being romantic, filled with food and surrounded by attire. Obsession is even mentioned in Q&A and interviews for this film. Not sure if the comment was merely coincidence but I still feel even though this film can be grouped with the other ones he's made about irritated and intense men (The Master, TWBB, PDL), at least it explores and surrounds itself in a cocoon of gentleness which I believe has made PTA grow as a storyteller. It's also a bit strange even though not as much as Altman's 3 Women, it still has this appealing, indelible weirdness stuck to it. Surely will be looked back on as a masterpiece. I was lucky to see the film in 70mm and it was a great watch with a great audience. I hope you have a similar experience. Thanks for reading."

The upper crust formality, assisted by another sublime performance from Daniel Day Lewis, is subterfuge for a slowly revealed joke about the contradiction of gender, the power of love and the cost/benefits of marriage, all leading to one hell of a punchline. This movie is like a perfectly executed standup routine delivered by the world's most unassuming comedian. I'll be laughing about this one for years to come. (Special shoutout to the already classic score by Jonny Greenwood. Like the rest of the film, it smartly highlights the wily humor by never acknowledging the film is a comedy. Everything is played straight, which only makes the central joke that much more hysterical and heartfelt.)"

It seems to me that Phantom Thread is a more accessible film than Magnolia, but you can still have the same problem with it as with the frog rain or perhaps any Paul Thomas Anderson film. I found Phantom Thread fascinating, and the acting splendid. It\u2019s a film about greatness (in a minor art called fashion) and obsession, which may be what you need to be great in anything. It\u2019s also about how people choose to live their lives \u2013 or maybe it\u2019s not really a choice. It\u2019s a fascinating film, and I enjoyed it."

I had the privilege of getting to see Phantom Thread in 70mm, and if you can find a 70mm screening near you, I highly recommend that you go see it in 70mm. In a year of amazing movies, Phantom Thread raises the bar. From a direction standpoint, everything is flawless. The acting is incredible, and Daniel Day Lewis and Vicky Krieps both completely disappear into their characters. The tension between the two leads is palpable, and I was on the edge of my seat the whole film. The costume design is stunning, and definitely one for the record books. Paul Thomas Anderson's script takes some huge risks that I really appreciated, and I never knew what was going to happen next. Every aspect of Phantom Thread is complex and deeply layered, and Paul Thomas Anderson truly went full Auteur for this film. This is not a film to be missed, and you'll probably have to watch it multiple times to catch all of the complexity and clues."

The good news is that Daniel Day-Lewis graces us with one more elegant and wonderful performance before he retires. Lesley Manville was also quite brilliant in her supporting turn alongside him. As for the rest of the film, the score and overall design of the film is quite a treat, but the story felt a bit uneven and really started to feel more and more aimless, especially towards the end. Overall, the film itself is good, but let's face it: If there's any reason to watch this film, it's for Day-Lewis' final bow onscreen, and he certainly doesn't disappoint."

      "text": "Daniel Day Lewis is so good an actor that I find him to be totally believable in almost any role he immerses himself in.  His portrayal of London dressmaker Reynolds Woodcock proves no exception. On the other hand, I found the whack ending to this movie to be far from believable, and consequently insufficient to salvage a film that is most easily labeled as a long-winded character study.The film is set is 1950\u2019s London.  It\u2019s time in which social rank and class snobberies are still quite in vogue.   Kudos to director Paul Thomas Anderson for his subtlety in this regard, and avoidance of a lot of overt explanations about the time, place and social class structure of the time, and leaving it to the viewer to figure out.  Woodcock is portrayed as a man who is totally self-absorbed.  His work is his life.  He demands perfection out of everyone around him.  He has zero capacity for indulging the needs or desires of others.  His clients are European high-society and royalty, but he does not socialize with them.  He has no friends; only the memory of his deceased mother to sustain him.  It\u2019s a life that appears to be full on the surface but, in fact, is mostly empty.   It\u2019s been reduced to a repeating cycle in which Woodcock works all hours of the day and night until he reaches the point of exhaustion.  Once he recovers, he starts the cycle over again.  The only time anyone can tell if he\u2019s happy is when he is ordering a big breakfast.Woodcock is not homosexual, but neither is he deeply physically or emotionally attracted to women.  Instead, he is attracted to women who have a certain body type that meet his ideal standard for fitting into the dresses that he creates.   When they later fail to meet up with his social and cultural standards (such as when they make too much noise while eating), he judges them inferior and becomes bored with them.Alma is a waitress in a restaurant.  Her accent gives her away as an immigrant.  Here again, director Paul Thomas Anderson wisely avoids overtly calling attention to their different social statuses.  Woodcock is attracted to her because shape.  She\u2019s flattered by his attention but thinks she can engage him on her terms, which succeeds only in annoying him.   Woodcock begins to lose interest and mocks her but, for reasons that are unclear, doesn\u2019t dismiss her.   It is at this point that the movie begins to lose credibility.  What she does to him next in retaliation is beyond forgivable but, bizarrely, Woodcock interprets her actions as true love.  Beyond that, I cannot tell you more without spoiling the movie.  Suffice it to say that the ending feels entirely out of character with the rest of the movie.  To my mind, it\u2019s vaguely reminiscent of Kathy Bates in Misery, and Isabella Rossellini in Blue Velvet."

      "text": "For any cinephile, going to the theater to see the latest Daniel Day-Lewis movie is considered mandatory viewing.  The same goes for director Paul Thomas Anderson, who, like Day-Lewis, opts for quality over quantity by selectively releasing a piece of work once every 3 to 5 years.  When combined, as they've done with 'Phantom Thread' (and the second such instance following 2007's 'There Will Be Blood'), the necessity in seeing the film is given an order of magnitude greater importance.At best, 'Phantom Thread' stands to receive a polarizing reaction from viewers.  It's a fine (I'd say perhaps even exemplary) film within the drilled-down genre of \"English-set period-piece romantic dramas.\"  However, when judged from a broader perspective, the film is simply far less captivating than either Day-Lewis' or Anderson's prior work, and the rather esoteric ending leaves audience members wishing the two had dedicated their respective time and effort to another pursuit."

I dutifully endured the seemingly interminable story of a sick romance between an insufferable twit who dresses up overprivileged but undistinguished women for a living and a ruthlessly manipulative former waitress who manages the herculean task of manifesting even more character flaws than the dressmaker whose life and career she threatens to destroy.  All the while, I was thinking, \"The critics are going to swoon over this self-consciously artsy-fartsy filmmaking bilge.\"  The story features fictional people almost as personally dysfunctional as many film critics are in real life, and the movie has all of the pretentious high-art characteristics that fascinate filmmaking students in art colleges but are lost on normal moviegoers who are simply seeking an evening of pleasant entertainment.  \"Phantom Thread\" evokes from viewers the same obligatory reaction a premiere performance of a commissioned work draws from a classical music audience on which it is inflicted: sufficient applause to avoid accusations of cretinism for failing to appreciate the finer things of life, accompanied by internal thanksgiving that it's over and that the long suffering audience will never have to experience it again."

While some of the cinematography is beautiful, the dialogue is painfully unrelatable and not written in a way that I have ever heard people speak in my lifetime. The performances hit the mark in that they achieve what PTA is going for, however  the characters are not compelling enough for you to invest your time and/or emotion in to. There is no character arc to speak of; tired old themes of mother issues are forced down your throat with no actual pay off. The story never really progresses until the final two minutes, and by that time you're left wondering why you have invested two hours of your time watching these horrible, uninteresting people."

There is nothing interesting about selfish, ignoble, infantile characters no matter how beautiful the setting or strong the acting. At least there could have been a lesson, a point made, anything. Where are the dramas we used to love? Where is the soul? This was postmodernist garbage. Lazy, unimpressive writing. The glamorization of weak and ugly personalities with no redemption or lesson and no further point but to appeal to the vanity of the audience is becoming such a turn off this will probably be the last movie I watch for a long time."

Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, the film, although shown in the super medium of 70mm and color, was, in my memory, an average black and white film. The plot is rather thin and the movie is much too long. When something is dull, even 10 minutes can seem like a lifetime so 2 hours and 20 minutes really accentuates the discomfort. Notwithstanding absolutely rave reviews from the professionals, I found this film to be an effort to watch and endure even with outstanding performances by Mr. Day-Held and Ms. Krieps.

      "text": "If Phantom Thread's only purpose was to serve as Daniel Day-Lewis's swan song, that'd be more than enough to justify its existence. Luckily, Phantom Thread manages to be much more than that. Shot with spherical lenses, Paul Thomas Anderson's film hearkens back to an era of film-making of decades past. The muted color scheme manages to draw attention to itself, though not in a gratuitous manner. It goes without saying that the film's set design and costuming is breathtakingly beautiful. That is not to say however, that Phantom Thread serves as a mere technical spectacle alone. The composition of each frame is so meticulously designed, that is starts to burrow into one's mind far after the credits roll. Day-Lewis delivers a performance for the ages, in a role that would be a lifetime achievement in acting excellence for any other actor. The role is Reynolds Woodcock, an enigmatic fashion designer whose intense attention to detail is matched only by his austere nature. Having a Freudian obsession with his deceased mother, the perennial bachelor meets Alma (Vicky Krieps), a waitress at a hotel he dines at early in the film, whom he takes  in as a model to pose for his dresses (The dresses themselves have an odd sort of aesthetic functionality to them. They elevate the wearer in a mental sense, giving them a regal authority in the way they carry themselves). Alma's presence is both welcome to the distant designer, and an intrusion of his work process. However, to simply summarize the film's plot points would do it a great disservice. Johnny Greenwood's continuing collaboration with Anderson has yet again proven fruitful. With its haunting strings, and melodic piano tones, the score is deeply immersive, and enriching. Day-Lewis doesn't take on characters, he hurtles himself at them, inhabiting their every idiosyncrasy to ludicrous detail. Anderson lets the camera roll, and Day-Lewis takes over. One imagines that Day-Lewis will be hoisting up that golden trophy come March, but it'd be an all too paltry of a recognition, given the work he's done here."

I'm pretty sure about an hour and 5 minutes of the movie could have been shaved off if the characters just stopped staring at each other and pausing before they spoke. Don't get me wrong, that can be sometimes powerful, but it was not at all utilized correctly in this film. It doesn't work when literally every character does it.The whole film is a demonstration of insanely toxic masculinity. For some reason, Vicky Krieps' character, Alma, finds this insanely attractive. It isn't until she meets Daniel Day-Lewis' character that she starts to feel good about herself. It's insanely offensive, and she is definitely no one's feminist role model. The fact that people are calling this a \"love story\" is disgusting.None of the characters were likable so I found the whole thing quite boring. It is difficult to pinpoint what parts I hated exactly, because they were all equally forgettable. Paul Thomas Anderson's characters had no personalities whatsoever. They were \"quirky\" and \"strange,\" but that's not a personality.I understand that this is supposed to be a haunting, semi-psychopathic film, but the way to really make that work is to make it as close to real-life as possible. Making it seem like it could happen in real life makes it truly scary. However, this did not seem like real life to me, because everything was just so flat. The dialogue was unnatural and disappointing.The two reasons that I'm giving this even a 3 is because the cinematography and the costume design was beautiful.

The plot resolution is not believable, nor did I care for the fate of the extremely unlikable characters. My wife was even disappointed with the fashion / creativity element she had anticipated enjoying. There is no background to the characters, so it is hard to know or sympathize with them. Even the soundtrack is irritating. I have seen 8 of 9 2017 best pic nominees (all but CMBYN) and this movie did not deserve to be in that class, imo."

Phantom Thread did not go the way I expected and although it took me a while to like it, the story eventually reeled me in and I became immersed in this captivating film. Not my usual kind of movie but it's Oscar season and apparently the last you'll see Daniel Day-Lewis in a movie. He's retired again so don't all gasp at once.Daniel Day-Lewis is the renowned dress-maker Reynolds Woodcock. Living in 1950s London, his routine life takes a change when he meets his new muse, a young woman named Alma (Vicky Krieps) yet his highly organised bachelor life is soon disrupted by Alma. We've had a couple of films this year that decide to take a weird turn in the third act and Phantom Thread certainly went off in an unexpected direction. Not your typical love story. Day-Lewis does it again, giving another brilliant performance. Perfect casting, the chemistry between Day-Lewis and Vicky Krieps was exceptional. This one is definitely a slow burner so let yourselves become engrossed in the elegance of Phantom Thread. The level of care in every single shot is mesmerizing, from the cinematography, the lavish dresses and the spectacular score by Jonny Greenwood. There's no denying Day-Lewis' performance is perfect and I expect nothing less to be honest. Yet what stood out the most for me was the haunting soundtrack. Absolutely stunning, one of the best film scores in recent years and well deserving of an Oscar. Highly recommended for all you Daniel Day-Lewis/Paul Thomas Anderson fans out there."

One can see how the minutes of the day tick away the same focus to detail and precision as his design and dressing, and the relief and reprieve from it requiring a collapse and relapse...I loved his dark hair, the sister\u2019s blue eyed turning steel-like looks, the staircase with its ascensions/descensions, just enough music, just enough wallpaperthe lavender colors, the country house with simple beds and pots and pans.... Even the asparagus is beautiful!"

There is no question that Lewis performed beautifully but the movie had too many unaswered questions so you left the theater in a limbo state. I wouldn't recommend this film. Wait till it comes to Netflick."

Daniel Day-Lewis delivers perhaps his most subtle (and effective) performance to date, 90 percent of which is driven by his mysterious, magnetic eyes."

It's the type of movie that takes 4 years of brainwashing at film school to make you think you enjoy it.  First 30 minutes were not bad but it has about 45 minutes of good material and a lot of boring filler.  I have seen a lot of artsy movies that I have really enjoyed and wanted to like this one but I just can't."
