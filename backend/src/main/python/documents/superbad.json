Michael Cera was much better when he had good material on Arrested Development. Funny film?? Not at all.

There are some really slow sections of the movie that hold it back from being a higher score, but one thing I really do appreciate about this movie is that it follows the old school comedy rule of saving the funniest moments for the end of the movie. The final ending is very poignant, and one I won't soon forget."

The plot had no tasteful point and it seems like they were just saying words such as \"d**k\" and \"v***na\" as many times as possible in a sentence without any sense. There weren't really lines or gestures that was funny, but it appears that people were just laughing in the theater because they feel obligated to get their money's worth. I was so disgusted I walked out of the theater (along with a large number of people). I should've known this movie was going to be super-bad since it shared similar distasteful lines and plot with Knocked Up. Disappointed."

Bought this full of anticipation after all the stellar reviews, set aside Sunday night (what a loser), settled down for a gutbusting laughfest and... er... couldn't believe how badly it sucked. In fact, I was so surprised at my negative reaction that I wondered if I'd been in some kind of dour mood without realising it and got a second opinion from my kid brother who loves the same nonsense (your Liebowskis, Anchormen, Taps etc) and was also massively pumped to watch the movie after the great reviews. His view: he was livid that he'd wasted two hours of his life that he'd never get back. Problems? Okay, here are a few: the main character is a c*ck. Not in a good, geeky, anti-hero kinda way. No, he's just a c*ck, in a fat, crass, thick angry whinging please-smack-me-in-the-mouth dish-it-out-but-can't-take-it-in-return kinda way. He's the thick, angry dude at a party that you just walk away from as fast as you can. And he's waaaaaaay too old for the role. His mate is as dull as a puddle so there's no comedy chemistry, just uninspired swearing met by empty puzzled/guilty looks. The whole McLovin thing was so fiercely try-hard and cynical. The cops' characters changed as the script required (one minute goofing, then psychopathic) but didn't amuse because of the drug-fuelled mood swings - it just seemed fake. The joy of the recent Apatow stuff has been that under the grotesquerie, the characters were oddly credible. This one, however, is nonsense. There's none of the Apatow goofing-around-great-fun-just-hanging-with-these-characters feel. There's none of the amiability of the benchmark for this sort of movie, American Pies 1 and 2 (and nothing to touch the brilliant set-piece gags from those movies); there's none of the inspired insanity of the better frathouse bashes like Animal House. It just doesn't deliver. And the bolt-on ending! WHY would that absolute raging hottie with a sensible head on her beautiful shoulders even look at Mr spiteful whiney aggressive oik, other than because the movie demanded that the two guys sorta \"get the gal\" at the end? Dude - weak. If I was meant to be rooting for him because he'd followed some long character arc... ah, no. 'Cos he didn't. He woke up hungover and feeling guilty because he'd been such a royal pain in the harris that even he'd spotted it. He inspired such antipathy in me, I would have much preferred it if the movie had ended with him falling in agonising slow motion down the long flight of stairs in that shopping mall. Would have been a two star review, but another star for the McLovin \"it's in!\" line, a solitary great moment that only underlined how duff the rest of this movie was. Everyone I have spoken to who has seen it agrees - rubbish film. Sorry folks, the critics all jumped a big emperor's clothes bandwagon. Save yourselves, it's too late for me."

Because there is no real issues here, I'm sure everybody dealt with much bigger things than this crap(and yes it can be funny), like race, teachers, music, dreams, growing up etc. But no, again this movie is painting a real sh!t view of American schools and why everyone i meet that went to a school like this has absolutely no personality.

      "text": "Judd Apatow is quickly becoming one of the most reliable sources for comedy. \"40 Year-Old Virgin\" was a terrific success, and it was only continued by what is the funniest movie of 2007, and oddly one of the most touching, \"Knocked Up.\" He is able to dispense a complete sense of realism in absurd situations and each film has you laughing all the way to the credits. Superbad is no exception. Two kids, Seth and Evan (played by Jonah Hill and Michael Cera respectively), are coming to the end of their high school years, and are facing the fact that they will be separated by college next year. They both are lacking in the love department, and wish to enter college non-virgins. Their friend Fogell (played hilariously by Christopher Mintz-Plasse), gets a fake ID, which sets them up as alcohol-snatchers for a party the upcoming night, with Seths crush hosting, and Evans crush going. The events that follow are hilarious. Although these boys have never known a womans sexual touch, they are still complete perverts, and scenes like the one in the chemistry class will have you bursting your gut. Also, the friendship between Seth and Evan can parallel the best friend kinship many felt during the high school years, where you never noticed how you acted slightly homosexual with your best friend, running by their needs and wants, and having petty arguments with them. Plus, Mclovins trip with the cops is a complete breeze, giving you laughter throughout every scene. Mclovins sense of partying and his blind innocence to finally just enjoying life is endearing, in a very different sort of way. When the two boys get to the party, and hilarities ensue, they are set out to either receive sex, or possibly learn a lesson about what girls really want. Slightly not as funny as Knocked Up, it is still a perfect pick for a great time at the theaters. Go, enjoy, and party with McLovin!"

      "text": "If you liked \"Knocked Up\" you'll probably like \"Super Bad\" starring some of the very same actors. The humor is super raunchy which rarely lets up. The subject matter mostly revolves around sex, drugs, and general bad boy and girl adolescent like behavior. There is not a lot of functionality about the characters at first, except maybe Evan who desires something more heartfelt. Yet even he succumbs halfway but does seem to hold true in the end. I would have thought this film to be somewhat nihilistic in overall philosophical outlook but by the end there does seem to be some deeper insights gained by the characters of their valued friendship and respect of the women in which they were tempted to objectify. This took a lot of internal fortitude as it seemingly went against the overarching cultural grain of the movie. Even many of the adults seemed to acts just as bad as the high schoolers, such as the police who seemed to be trying to relive their youth. Some of their stunts were silly and somewhat funny, especially one line with Fogell. However their excessive immaturity did not seem very realistic, though it helps just to go along it. \"Mclovin\" by the way just about stole the show with his half nerdy/half cool, and mostly lucky antics. However in the end it was he who was still trying to impress the chics with his faked IDs and staged arrests. Not much social redeeming value though I found it funny. \"Super Bad\" was neither super bad nor super good, though definitely worth a viewing. I did however think the film and many others lately push the envelope by using children to portray adult subject matter. Though I laughed at some of the private parts drawings it did seem to cross a line we rarely seem to question any more. I am concerned society is spinning in a less than wholesome direction. I am conflicted as to whether to support this film in light of this fact however it seems appropriate to deal with society in relation to how it is now and not some idealized moral standard. However it is my hope there will be a push for at least some cinematic restraints. In short \"Super Bad\" can entertain, offer some insight about friendship and treating others as human beings, but I doubt it will go down in the annals of film as a classic to forever be remembered."

      "text": "\"Superbad\" wasn't written by Judd Apatow, it just seems like it was. In \"Knocked Up\", Pete(Paul Rudd) would rather engage in fantasy baseball with the guys than hang out with his wife. Seth(Jonah Hill), at eighteen(too young to be suffering a midlife crisis), is barely five seconds into his burgeoning romance with Jules(Emma Stone) before he starts missing Evan(Michael Cera). Penis life-drawings notwithstanding, I don't think Seth is supposed to be read as gay, he just enjoys homosocial (not homosexual) relationships. \"Superbad\" is not the uproarious comedy it's purported to be(I think the problem is that Christopher Mintz-Plasse is a little green), but it's a success because of the film's willingness to portray male friendships with a frank ickiness not previously seen in American mainstream cinema. It's as if the screenwriters read William S. Pollack's \"Real Boys: Rescuing Our Sons From the Myth of Boyhood\"."
