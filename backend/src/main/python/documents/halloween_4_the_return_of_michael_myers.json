After slaughtering his attendants, Myers sets out to find his one living relative who is, fortunately, being cared for by a kind and resourceful foster sister named Rachel. Meanwhile, the ever-cautious Dr. Loomis remains on the killer's path.",

      "text": "\"Halloween 4\" stands with the original \"Halloween\" on my list of favorite Halloween movies. The storyline to this film was fantastic. The acting was brilliant. Too bad that we didn't hear much from Ellie Cornell after this movie and Halloween 5, but she is a fantastic actress. Danielle Harris's portrayal of Jamie Lloyd, Laurie Strode's 9 year old daughter is what makes this movie my favorite. Brilliant actress. And of course, Donald Pleasence never ever disappoints."

      "text": "Is it as good as the first one? No. Is that a fair statement? No. Halloween II did its fair share to distance the franchise from its brilliant roots, and with no Carpenter on board, H4 didn't stand a chance to fully right the ship. That said, it got plenty of things right; this is probably the best of the many, many sequels in the series. Can't say I was crazy about Michael's mask in this one, and the opening murder scene is too much of a stretch, even for this kind of movie. On the plus side, the atmosphere and viewer psychology of the first movie are back; the traumatized town in a blackout makes an awesome setting, and there is a better balance of scare scenes versus down time, which tricks you into letting your guard down in time for big moments. And even though I was never that crazy about the ending, it is undoubtedly a clever attempt at bringing the franchise full circle. Of all the different canons of Halloween out there, the I-II-4 trilogy is the best, as long as you pretend that 5 and 6 never happened."

      "text": "In my opinion the best sequel of the series even though we're supposed to believe Myers grew his eyes back after being shot out in the last sequel. Besides that its pretty damn amazing. Myers returns in strong form cementing his position as one of cinemas greatest villains. Picking up over ten years after the events of the first two films. Laurie Strode has passed and left her daughter behind. A new family is fostering her and Michael returns home and will stop at nothing to get to her. The performances are solid all around but Ellie Cornell as Rachael makes one hell of a final girl. However the MVP goes to Danielle Harris as young Jamie. It's truly one of the best genre performances ever. The movie also has some thrilling stalk scenes including the best scene in any slasher film, the rooftop chase. All in all it's a well paced, suspenseful franchise sequel best."

      "text": "A very mediocre yet entertaining piece of the franchise from the late 80's. While it was nice to see the franchise get back to its roots by brining Myers back, it's weighed down by a forced plot and some extremely cheesy moments. Pleasance as Loomis keeps it most interesting when even some of the scenes with Myers are just plain stupid. Overall it's ok at best but very forgettable."

      "text": "After being shot, blinded, blown up & set on fire Michael took a little R&R and has now come back somehow by reasons not quite explained for Halloween 4. Obviously this movie was made to milk Halloween for whatever credibility it had left as a franchise and it fails to reach the heights of the first one or even the 2nd one. That being said, Halloween 4 is by no means a bad movie, its still quite watchable. Laurie Strode is gone but Dr. Loomis returns again somehow, though played expertly by Donald Pleasance. The other 2 leads, played by Ellie Cornell and Danielle Harris are incredibly well acted and along with Pleseance help carry the movie well. All in all, its not a bad movie by any means its just not that good either."

      "text": "The most under-rated of all the Halloween sequels and in my opinion the best sequel of them all. It still falls into the gore hound trap that was started with all of the original Halloween imitators out there as a way to compensate the lack of suspense of the original. Donald Pleasance offers his gravitas to Dr. Loomis and grounds the entire production giving it the tie in to the original two movies. It is a shame they could not get Jamie Lee Curtis back for this chapter, but the character of Jamie Lloyd gives a new face to the victim and provides an ending that still, after all these years gives me chills to watch. It is a crying shame that they chickened out with further sequels to take the franchise in new directions laid out by this movies ending with two absolutely atrocious sequels after this one. As far as I am concerned out of the original Halloween 6 movie franchise there is the original, II and 4."

The story has shifted from Lori Strode and that added new elements to the film. Loomis is back and is doing a good job as always. Overall, it was a good effort and is one of my favorite slasher film sequels."

The movie had all the elements which made first part masterpiece but these elements were not effective in this part mainly due to less interesting story, less suspense, plot holes, senseless screenplay and bad direction. It seemed like director didn't do his homework. He made Myer's tall, healthy and his mask was also little bit different.Only good thing was the performance of Danielle Harris who plays Jamie. She plays the character with complexity, fear, determination, and desperation so well.If you're a fan of the original Halloween, you will like Halloween 4 to a certain degree. But just like many sequels, it cannot live up to the original."

A definite WTF ending (which I thought was pretty corny in all honesty), but for the most part pretty well executed. It did seem to lack some sort of intensity present in the earlier sequels however. Definitley seems to be a pretty well received sequel judging by the other comments, and I too would recommend it."

For having a \"4\" tacked on the end of it, it's really not bad.  It maintains a foreboding and ominous mood throughout, and does a good job at convincing you of the time of year (moody lighting, foggy streets etc.).  Another thing it has going for it is a pretty creepy ending.  The atmosphere alone makes it a good halloween-time rental, but it's all been done before."

Long awaited by fans, and long scorned by critics as squandering any praiseworthy qualities of the first two films, Halloween IV manages to revive the series by revealing a new character that was later abandoned in the true successors to the originals (Halloween VII, Halloween VIII). While it does at least attempt to provoke some fear, it is through great time wasted that those few seconds of fear are brought. A  race through across the rooftop is literally the only memorable scene in this abysmal film. While not as weak and boring as the sixth installment, it does lack the enthralling camp of the fifth film, or the second to continue this direct plot."
