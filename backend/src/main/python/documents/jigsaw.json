      "text": "The Saw franchise returns seven years after the not-so-final chapter was released, continuing the beaten dead horse tradition of horror franchises returning for more quick cash grabs after supposedly being done a la Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, etc. After seeing this one just for kicks and giggles, I can confidently say that this did not warrant resurrecting this franchise at all! The characters were all dumb and unlikable, the dialogue was unbelievably clumsy and absurd quite often throughout, and of course, the ending deliberately left the door open for potential sequels to follow, go figure! Overall, I'd find it difficult to picture even die-hard Saw fans finding much to like about this one, other than the expected gore and over-the-top deaths, because in terms of story and acting, this one hits an all new low for the franchise."

The \"main trap\" of the movie fails to surprise, and the effect it should cause its reduced by the transitions with other scenes out of the context. I have to admit that I really enjoyed the connection with the overall plot from the franchise, mostly because of the ending.The movie kept the same \"style\" as the previous movies, so if you keep your expectations based on the last movies from the franchise, I think you'll probably enjoy it."

There are only so many ways you can kill someone in the most grotesque way imaginable before it all starts to become rather dull. Jigsaw torturing his victims for an hour and a half is the most boring thing you can watch.Dead people are popping up around the city, each dying a gruesome death and all the evidence is pointing towards John Kramer aka Jigsaw aka someone who's supposed to be dead for the past ten years. Ooh scary. The entire film moves from a scene of torture to a scene in a laboratory with everyone staring suspiciously at one another because maybe someone knows something about these murders that they just shouldn't. Now let's move to another torture scene with saws and acid. And back to the lab we go for some plotsplaining. This might be where the mystery and suspense should come in but it doesn't. No atmosphere, not scary, an absolute waste of space. It's not painful to watch due to the extreme violence, it's painful because it's so bad it's boring. Not recommended, not worth your time, hopefully this will be the Saw movie that ends all Saw movies because this is a franchise that no one cares about anymore, whatever appeal Saw originally had is gone now."

In this eighth installment for the Saw franchise, things saw a huge improvement right after the disappointment of Saw 3D but Jigsaw still has a long way to go to becoming the horrifying treat of the year."

      "text": "I must say this film cannot be compared to the original \"Saw\" movie. Despite this, it's a great franchise resurrection (after the terrible \"Saw 3D\").So, what's about film's advantages? First of all, it provides fans a totally new story and awesome plot at all: \"meat\" is not a word to describe the content of \"Jigsaw\" as blood-scenes here take quite a small part (I guess, to remind us of what franchise this film is a part of). Actually, it's a detective with horror elements and, to be honest, a GOOD one. Puzzles, twists and suspense - that's it! You watch \"Jigsaw\" being confused by the plot and then you are amazed by the explanations in the end - that's what I missed in the last \"Saw\" films, especially in the totally transparent and dull seventh one.What's more, the actors played really well. Panic? Fear? Pain? All this emotions were transferred by them in the best way. Also, I've noticed quite a great soundtrack: thanks Charlie Clouser for this magnificent music that perfectly suits the film.OK, and what about film's drawbacks?Well, I can't say straight, but the micro-humor of this film isn't necessary at all. It only disturbs you while watching such serious movie like \"Jigsaw\". OF COURSE, it doesn't make the film comic (oppositely to the dumb trailer), but it's just useless. You remove it - you get a cleanliness in the plot.The second thing I don't like in \"Jigsaw\" is its gamma. Do you remember the fifth film with its beautiful blue tones? Such detail increases the film's atmosphere and also \"Saw V\" was a boring project, it was atmospheric. What about \"Jigsaw\"? Its gamma is neutral. Just neutral with no expressions. At first you watch a great actors' performance, but then you get confused by the movie's strange colors, for instance, there's no gloominess in the indoor games scenes like it was in the \"Saw II\", consequently, no claustrophobic feelings.Two pluses, two minuses, but my rating of the film is 8. I am a fan of the \"Saw\" franchise and I like its new part.My consensus is that \"Jigsaw\" is a wonderful film with a few drawbacks. Thank you, Spierig brothers for this new experience!(Pardon if my English was wrong sometimes - I am a foreign man and still learn it.)"

      "text": "The \"Saw\" films may be Halloween traditions, but the last films in the franchise (5-7) were some of the worst and most confused, incoherent messes ever in any major horror franchise. And now \"Jigsaw\" is here to continue that tradition. \"Jigsaw\" is a mess from beginning to end, it has no idea what it wants to be, or even where it should be in the brain dead timeline of this franchise. The kills are surprisingly tame, and even with the blood, do nothing to stand out from any of the other films, or even the numerous \"Saw\" ripoffs. The characters are stock, moronic, and just plain unlikeable, you are given no reason to care for any of these characters. I believe, that out of all these films, \"Jigsaw\" has the most forced appearances by Tobin Bell, he shows up because the movie tries to used the most obvious, and predictable twist this series could muster up (The movie is set between two timelines, and apparently this counts a prequel too...see the problem)"

      "text": "Not the first time a long-running horror series has made a return after it's supposed final chapter. Jigsaw delivers more of what fans want and not much else. It's new twists are clever, but perhaps not the most complex. It doles out hints at regular intervals so those who are paying attention and actively trying to figure things out before the big reveal will likely pick up on what's really going on in spite of the fake-outs. It's not as fun as just waiting for the explanations, but to each their own. My personal recommendation would be to let things play out without putting any real thought into it, because the plot is just creative enough to catch you off guard if you do. Plus this is the Saw series. Actually using your brain when watching it could kill your enjoyment of the entire thing. The new traps are fun and the deaths are as delightfully gory as ever. The Spierig's have come up with a quite a few inventive ways to kill people so the thrills of the game are still in place. You'll just have to put up with a moment of two of glaring stupidity from it's participants. It's always irritating when the would be survivors refuse to work with one another and instead just scream and refuse to cooperate. Especially in Jigsaw's case where someone's death was completely avoidable as they already new the solution, but would rather just cry and yell. At least when they go they do a lot of bleeding in the process. It's called torture-porn for a reason. This stuff isn't for the squeamish.All in all it's a worthy follow up for series. It relies on some familiar plot elements, but does enough of it's own thing to stand out from the rest of the movies while still managing to connect with them. Saw has found it's way into some good hands that have left the door open for even more. Who knows what will come next. As a fan of the previous films I enjoyed this comeback and wouldn't mind seeing the games continue on from this point. So yeah, Jigsaw is a success. Are you ready to see people receive the gruesome judgement in store for them? Are you ready to play another game? Well that option is finally here. Live or die, make your choice."

The Saw movies main characters are the traps, so you might think that they should put some thought into the traps, but no. I just hate when actions in movies doesn't make sense. To recap some example: One dude is standing exactly where a lasso is laid out on the floor. One dude is falling through the floor with one leg where a trap is. Two people goes into a silo that fills up with grain with different kinds of tools falling down on them, always landing with the pointy end down. A couple of nails falls perfectly into a womans arm. People with just some logical sense understand the impossibility of that happening. In other words: The traps, and the outcome of the movie, are dependent on stupid people walking into the traps themselves with a huge amount of randomness and lack of logic, lack of physics and lack of human anatomy involved in making the traps lethal. I bet there's tons of writers out there who could've done a much much better job."

My one main problem is that they left out the question from the previous film but I enjoyed it. Good story, good writing, acceptable acting, and gory fun! I recommend this film."
