But when Jenko meets a kindred spirit on the football team, and Schmidt infiltrates the bohemian art major scene, they begin to question their partnership. Now they don't have to just crack the case - they have to figure out if they can have a mature relationship. If these two overgrown adolescents can grow from freshmen into real men, college might be the best thing that ever happened to them.",

They also mine lots of comedy from the bromance aspects of their partnership. Tatum is even more hilarious with his thick-headed dumbness. Toss in some enjoyable supporting characters and fun action sequences. It rarely happens, but it seemed like this was better than the original. It's a genuinely funny movie. NOTE: The final bit after the credits is worth staying for."

Really?\" it kinda felt like it was rehashing the first movie a little bit. but all that aside, like i said: \"22 Jump Street\" is the most hysterical buddy-cop comedy we got so far this year. and i'll be damned if this wasn't better than the first movie, cause yea it was better and funnier. (with the most hysterical end credits ever!)"

The movie plays out the same movie and is really a reply of the first one. It has moments where it's hilarious, but then runs with gags that aren't very funny. When I say runs with them, I mean ten minutes of the same gag that just isn't funny. It reminds me of this is the end. I'm giving it the same score for a reason. The jokes are funny at parts but other gags are just god awful. This is the end has moments where it's ten times funnier than anything in 22 jump street, but the quantity of gags is more in this one.

Certain gags try too hard and yes the plot is basically the same (the latter isn't really a bad thing). You can tell the film is happily aware of this and embraces it fully. Some of the best, understated jokes come from this knowledge. This meta-comedy does keep things afloat, but it doesn't turn into a laugh riot until the movie starts doing its own thing.\r The closer it gets to the end the more frequent the laughs become. The spring break scenario is hilarious. Everything else before that is funny, but not as funny as the first movie. At least not until Ice Cube appears on-screen. His character has a larger role and the scenes with him had me rolling on the floor thanks to a surprising and well-done subplot.\r While it doesn't hit all the same high-notes as the first I would be lying if I said I didn't laugh throughout. It's still a very funny movie. One that uses inside jokes about sequels in a way rarely seen. An excellent example of meta-comedy done right, and a solid sequel for fans of the first. My total score for the movie is a 7.4/10."

      "text": "With wit and self-mockery, 22 Jump Street brings bromance, satirical action scene and a good dose of laughter. It succeeds in avoiding redundancy of a sequel, which the movie itself points out, and brings enjoyable foolhardy yet sufficiently clever humor. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum is a great couple, half of the jokes are on their expenses. Plenty of romance analogy delivered in staggeringly serious way, while the rest of it is over-the-top comedy. Script is smart, bordering on improvised banter, and it neatly pokes on popular culture.\r Commendably, the movie sneers at some of the clich\u00e9s, even those that it uses. This opens up many opportunities as it practically makes jokes of, and on, itself. Plot follows Jenko (Tatum) and Schmidt (Hill) into a college for the search of another drug. While some scenes might be a bit inflated, it keeps the humor grounded without resorting to forced slapstick. Hill and Tatum have great chemistry together, with tons of relationship jokes, they boast their acting prowess by keeping straight faces on what must be pretty ungraceful scenes.\r Screenplay feels fast and tight, scenes don't overstay their welcome as it keeps churning jest at consistent pace. Action sequences are watered down and cynical remarks of those used in stereotypical action flicks. While they may be slightly predictable, the movie keeps these anticipated scenes fresh. Some events are unbelievably cartoon-like, down to the use of visible effect, but it's forgivable considering the movie produces humor literally until the end credit.\r 22 Jump Street possesses a rich sense of humor that will appeal to mainstream audience while also maintaining the adequate level of sophistication. Despite what it quips in the spirit of self-awareness, this sequel is as good, or even better than its predecessor."

The plot is simple\u2013the two hilarious undercover cops head back to collage to find and stop a drug ring that has surfaced at the school. One thing that really stood out to me was how self-aware this film was, almost so much so, it becomes annoying. For example, it constantly referenced how sequels never live up to the first one, and how the plot between the two was the same. Something that bothers me in the genre of comedy lately, is the stress factored into a film that is supposed to be relaxing to viewers and hold some good laughs. 22 Jump Street handled this really well, as it had some very funny scenes while some were exaggerated, over-the-top. The movie seemed to reuse jokes and clich\u00e9 ideas that were not very entertaining. Don\u2019t get me wrong, 22 Jump Street is still hilarious, but expect the same kind of comedy as in the original. The chemistry between the two leads is great and carries the whole movie pretty well. I felt like the run time was a bit long and could have been condensed to make a better movie. The pacing was a little off, almost awkward at times, where dead-time could have been filled with more laughs or simply left on the cutting room floor; this detracted from the overall film. Unrealistic scenarious seemed to overwhelm the comedic aspect quite a bit. I have to say, I laughed my butt off. \u00a0Even though it wasn't the most creative comedy, it was simple, didn't require much thinking and let me just sit back and laugh.

This film caused me to laugh out loud throughout. Tatum and Hill make for an amazing comedic tandem. Their timing is fantastic and the dialogue is well done and witty. Despite having a story that is nearly identical to the previous film, it works. They made the film different enough to still be a great film. It is rare that I say this, but this sequel is every bit as good as the first film.\r The Bad: While it works, it is still the same film over again and that does take away a LITTLE. Should there be a third offering, they are going to need to think of something else. Since it is a continuation of the first, and pretty much the same thing, you won't like the sequel if you didn't enjoy the previous film. A few jokes later in the film got old and ran a little long, especially an odd fist fight between Hill and a female character."

With all that said the film isn\u2019t a masterpiece either. The humor feels a bit more eager/desperate to please this time around, the film is more frantic with pacing, and despite all its jokes about unoriginal sequels this film does have a fair amount of rehashing. But the main reason why this film isn\u2019t as good as the first one is it lacks the heart the first one did. All heartfelt moments feel forced and generic and the chemistry between Hill and Tatum isn\u2019t quite as strong as it was in the first film being more mean-spirited this time involving a somewhat generic argument clich\u00e9. Despite all those issues though I enjoyed the film. The saving grace of this film is that most of the jokes work really well preventing it from being a letdown and somewhat disguising the fact that this is a cashgrab. Its miles ahead of the Hangover sequels and is not the disappointment I thought it would be. If you are a fan of the first one definitely check it out as you\u2019ll probably enjoy it just don\u2019t expect a great sequel. If you didn\u2019t like the first one this one won\u2019t do anything to change your mind.  For a film that didn\u2019t needed to exist, and was probably ordered by Hollywood, Chris Miller and Phil Lord stepped up to the plate to deliver a film that may not blow you away or have the same lasting appeal as the first one but is still enjoyable and provides a lot of laughs. To the guys who made the Hangover sequels, take notes this is how you do a good comedy sequel."

      "text": "Channing Tatum, and Jonah Hill..such an odd ball pairing in every way shape or form. A buff macho, and dull headedness, mixed with a brainy, textual and lame counterpart. Who would think this pairing could, and most importantly, should work. Their names; Chris Lord and Phil Lord, the creative duo behind the fresh and lively revival of the series that made Johnny Depp famous.\rIn contrast of course I'm speaking in regards to the highly successful 2012 sleeper hit \"21 Jump Street\". A buddy cop action comedy, that knew no boundaries and greatly stumbled where others have gone before, and all the same felt original, unique and it was very, very funny. I can't say the same for it's uptight, overly obsessive sequel. Amply titled \"22 Jump Street\". (In case you're wondering, they moved across the street).\r Sure we have the original team on board for more mischief and mayhem. Doing almost word for word the exact same thing. \"Do what you did the first time...and everyone's happy\". I can say, to an extent that this approach works, and for many moviegoers they will appreciate it. I just missed the improvisation and flamboyance that made it's predecessor memorable. Surprises at every corner. Granted, \"22 Jump Street\" has enough surprises, comedic wit, and action to make it mildly enjoyable for the audience it's strictly geared towards. Fans looking for a decent follow-up, should look no further. Because, there is a lot of the same, and nothing else.\r Schmidt and Jenko are back. Promising on the goodwill from the last one \"you two .. are going to college\" and finally we are made good on this promise. There is, of course, a new synthetic drug at MC State where the two must, evade into the personal lives of their fellow classmates, and neighbors, or \"Infiltrate the dealer...find the supplier\". To describe it blunty.\r Arguably, the best notion about the screenplay, penned by Josh Mccall and Jonah Hill was it's ability to take Schmidt and Jenko's relationship farther than before. It's probably best to pick up a copy of \"21 Jump St\" before seeing it's sequel, as there are many references that you may have forgotten. Rest assured for fans not familiar with the first one, the film opens with a funny recap of the events that took place on \"21 Jump Street\". While some things never change, the fauq identities \"Doug\" and \"Brad\" McQuaid are still in tact. Channing Tatum's Brad gets to experience the popular side of things now, while Jonah Hill's Doug sits on the sidelines, literally. The two sort of branch out, and do their thing. \"Brad\" gets to live his dreams of playing Football, and maybe one day drive that lamborghini. In addition \"Doug\" is playing the opposite of his post \"high school days\" there is no charismatic Dave Franco to lean on this time.\r The action set pieces are actually quite impressive. I was in tuned more with the plot this time around then I was previously, which is a good thing. I guess. Did I really wanna be motivated by an intricate of plot points? not entirely. Will I take em? sure, why not. Never is it more diverse than it needs to be. The jokes kind of up the ante a little bit. There are two or three laugh out loud jokes, instead of having the same consistency and flow the original had. Believe me. when \"22 Jump Street\" is funny, it's pretty comical all the same.\r In addition, the softness that Tatum brings to Jenko is like a teddy bear. You can't be mad or angry ever, because he is just sensitive. There is a good bit about how, Jenko takes a Sexuality class.. and all of sudden becomes an advocate for gay rights. \"I said a lot of gay slurs in high school\" he refers to his partner, to which Hill responds amicably \"yeah most of them directed at me\". These are the scenes that propel the film. That goodwill unfortunately lags after about the first hour. If you can believe it, the best jokes in the film actually belong to Ice Cube, who returns as the loud mouth, and stereotypical police chief. The best joke lies between him and Jonah Hill's character, I won't spoil it for you, however, it's a great joke worth the price of admission alone.\r In the end, of course the budget is obviously bigger, and, as with most, sequels usually tend to overdo it a tad. Phil Lord and Chris Miller take the time with certain advancements, but are given a slew of extras that, was underutilized. Rarely is a sequel good, and it's even more rare to be better than it's predecessor. I can say that \"22 Jump Street\" tries it's best, and never succeeds. Jonah Hill and Tatum are great together. The two have remarkable on screen chemistry. When you have a film as golden as \"21 Jump Street\" it's always going to be tough to top it. While my sheer opinion won't sway anyone from seeing this film. Sadly, \"22 Jump Street\" is another sequel in a long line, that has failed to live up to it's already high standards set before it.\r C+\r By: Nate Adams\r Directed By: Phil Lord, and Chris Miller\rRated: R\rRuntime: 118 mins\rStudio: Sony\rRelease Date: June 13th 2014\r Thanks For Stopping By."
