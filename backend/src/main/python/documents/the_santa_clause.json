Tim is your stereotype toy designer solely interested in making a buck when \"there arose such a clatter.\"  Yup, Tim becomes Santa and his whole world turns upside down.  Duh, who wouldn't?  Throughout the movie, Tim's low voice comic retorts are hilarious.  Maybe the low score Users and the critics didn't like that type of humor."

It's not the greatest Christmas film ever, but it's reasonably fun and merry and features a good performance by Tim Allen. If you're looking for something a little different for Christmas time, \"The Santa Clause\" is good fun for the whole family."

This is absolutely one of the best roles Tim Allen has ever played, and this unique and fun interpretation of the Santa legend is not easily forgotten. Its easy to see why many people find this to be a holiday hit!"

      "text": "Santa Clause is the frosting on the Christmas cake, that good gift that you weren't hoping for, probably will play with for a short time, and then ignore for a long time. While some jokes are great and the premise is innocent, Tim Allen's Santa is neither endearing nor memorable. The movie features plenty of great ideas, but lacks substance to make those ideas shine. It's almost as if The Santa Clause doesn't know what it wants to be: a holiday comedy or a dramatic look at the strain of being Santa on family life. Either way, the movie is neither a Christmas classic nor a horrid fruit cake, relying on witty jokes and fresh ideas to mask the repetitiveness of the boring story and the lack of cheer found in this new Santa.\r 6/10\rFollow me on twitter. @cbeers2513"

      "text": "The Santa Claus. Funny and funny story. The beginning of the Christmas franchise about his most recognizable symbol marked the beginning of Tim Allen to perform his most magical role. Santa Claus in his performance looks great and you can repeat as much as you like that the whole film is one big fairy tale and everything is done too kindly and for children, but no. This is a very funny and at the same time insanely atmospheric film for which you will have to make yourself cocoa, wrap yourself in a blanket and turn off the lights and watch without stopping. Once again, I would like to note Tim Allen, as he perfectly played the rebirth from a cynical person into a real good-natured man in a red hat."
