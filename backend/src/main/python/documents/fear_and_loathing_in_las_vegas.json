The directing really makes you feel as if you are under the influence and really puts you into the mindset of Duke (Johnny Depp's character). As for the acting, it was quite good as well and Depp really played the role of the constantly under the influence writer very well. Only gripes were the utter lack of character development, which certainly hurts. The seemingly all over the place plot would normally be a gripe of mine as well, but in a film like this, it certainly makes a ton of sense."

      "text": "As in typical Terry Gilliam fashion, \"Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas\" is rife with provocative imagery and creative camera work, but with that you also end up running into the trade-off of a typical Gilliam work -- if you're a more mainstream-minded moviegoer with easygoing sensibilities, you're going to feel a bit alienated by all of the weirdness. That's not to say this is unwatchable. In fact, it's far from it. As each -- admittedly episodic -- scene goes by, you as an audience member feel as though there's always some sort of concerted effort being placed into doing something new; some different kind of framing, movement, color palette, or effect that'll make things interesting. There's at least that. Beyond this, though, it seems the film represents more of a treat for those who are fans of the novel and the larger-than-life man behind it, rather than plain ol' vanilla-loving normies like me. But that's not to say it wasn't at least worth a look."

      "text": "Bottom line: Well done and very trippy movie.\r Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is the story about journalist Raoul Duke and his attorney, Dr. Gonzo. Duke is on an assignment to report on a big motorcycle race held outside of Las Vegas. The two decide to make the trip a drug fueled journey to search for the American Dream.\r Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is the adaptation of the novel of the same name by Hunter S. Thompson. Thompson, if you aren\u2019t familiar, was the Rolling Stone journalist responsible for inventing \u201cGonzo Journalism\u201d which focuses on the experience of an event rather than event itself as in the case of traditional journalism. The product of Gonzo journalism is something of a stream of consciousness: half fact, half fiction.\r This is a really rather grotesque movie and, quite honestly, I didn\u2019t really like it. At the same time, it was quite a good movie. That sounds contradictory. If it was a pretty good movie, why wouldn\u2019t I like it? Well, the guys in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas are taking an obscene amount of drugs. It\u2019s a trip that might very well kill them. It isn\u2019t a happy experience and the movie illustrates that well particularly through the cinematography.\r The acting in this film is really good. I was initially turned off because I saw Johnny Depp acting like Captain Jack Sparrow or the Mad Hatter or Tonto and I for one am sick of drunken Keith Richards. But this is the first movie that he ever acted this way. With that in mind, I\u2019ll let it pass. And after watching some interviews with Hunter S. Thompson, I found Depp\u2019s impression spot on. Benecio Del Toro\u2019s performance as Dr. Gonzo is stellar. The pair jump between the effects of the drugs seamlessly as naturally as if one drug wears off to be replaced by another.\r Throughout Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas we never really know what is true and what is a drug induced hallucination. You can say this type of thing about lot\u2019s of movies but here it transcends the movie itself. When I said that Thompson\u2019s work is half fact and half fiction, I really meant that we can\u2019t really take very much of it as \u201cfact\u201d. I always thought Fear and Loathing was about Hunter S. Thompson and his friend going to Vegas but, really, it is about the invented character, Duke, going to Vegas. I wasn\u2019t particularly familiar with Hunter S. Thompson so I watched a 1970\u2019s or \u201880\u2019s BBC documentary about him. The documentary maker, like so many of Thompson\u2019s fans, confused Thompson with Duke. The filmmaker even took Thompson the Vegas hoping to see the cult hero in action. Thompson then spoke about this tendency. When he is invited to speak at a university, are they hoping to hear Raoul Duke or Hunter S. Thompson? I originally thought that the premise, a motorcycle race, was the \u201cfact\u201d. I made the mistake of reading fiction as \u201cnon-motorcycle race\u201d instead of \u201ceverything.\u201d The identity of Raoul Duke, the film\u2019s narrator, adds another layer of fiction to the film; even though Depp looks and sounds like Thompson, he is Raoul Duke.\r To add another layer of uncertainty, consider the marketing campaign for this film. According to an interview I heard, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas focused heavily on TV spots and the majority of them featured Cameron Diaz even though she's in the movie for about a minute. It feels like the truth of this movie is muddled into fiction on every level; from the story to the marketing, nothing is reliable.\r Would I recommend Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas? You might want to pass, for the time being, if you are looking for something light and fun, but other sure; it is a weird and disconcerting movie but enthralling."

Visually the movie is wonderful and manages to simulate what it would be like while tripping on drugs like LSD. Almost every scene is colorful, bizarre and sometimes frightening.The biggest issue with Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is the writing and story telling. Simply put, the movie starts off with the most very basic idea of a story and then just goes completely off the rails.
