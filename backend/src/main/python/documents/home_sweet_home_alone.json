I don't like the fact they used music from the original, yet they found fault with the original. John Williams should not have approved his music being used in this rubbish. The plot was lame.  Don't waste your time on this poor excuse so-called movie."

But that film like many classics will always have that charm, especially a Christmas classic.So this ''update'' will perhaps have as its greatest merit to get some new generations to come to see the original film and that's fine by me.The kid has a lot of heart, but that's not enough to make this dreck work."

This is an assault on the franchise which jumped the shark hard after Home Alone 2, which was decent, but Home Alone exists in a perfect pocket universe and needs to be respected. They could have done so many things (and even included an adult Macaulay Culkin) and respected the first movie and done so many creative things, but instead, they followed Home Alone 3,4,5 and now 6, all complete and total utter garbage. Hollyraype, PedoWood, Hollyweird is a disgraceful low-brow dirty abusive evil vile culture of woke trash these days and all they do is debase and degrade all modern western mythologies. Im sick of it and neither myself nor my large family will be giving any money to these vile scum in PedoWood - torrents only to see what I'm \"missing\" - not much. This movie has such a scumbag unlikeable kid in the center of it all and this is meant to drag a certain race and culture through the dirt."

To me, you watch this movie while gearing up to watch classic Holiday movies like the Santa Clause, The Grinch & Elf. It'll get you into the Holiday spirit. It is well cast and well done.Is it going to win awards, NO, is it an amazing movie, that is going to change the landscape of cinema, NO. But if that is what you are wanting, you're probably not watching a \"Home Alone\" movie. Take it for what it is and enjoy the ride it takes you on!"

No interesting characters, no decent jokes and a bunch of bad guys that you need sympathy for because they are actually good guys. Why? They managed to make every single character in this movie extremely dull, while every \"joke\" just screams \"look at this, this is funny!\". It's not, none of the forced jokes are funny. This entire thing is an embarassment to the movie industry. Half of the final battle the burglars are fighting ramdom things like a wall and a swimming pool. No boobytraps involved.

I guess they thought they'd get extra points for the self-dig. The dialogue delivery sometimes felt like they were reading off a teleprompter.

Instead of being comically evil villains, they're just a couple who are down on their luck and are trying to recover something stolen from them that they need to feed their family. It's not fun to watch them get sent on fire and stabbed by thumbtacks because they've done nothing wrong. They don't even want to do the robbery but they have to in order to feed their family. No idea what they were trying to do here. Instead of having the main kid be funny and likable and the villains be comically evil with hilarious things happening to them, you instead just get some **** rich kid beating the hell out of some down on their luck couple."

Fact of the matter is the movie is about two people who are trying to steal their own property back after they think a kid stole it. The kid is trying to defend his house when he is left home alone. The problem is, when you have the two people begging for their lives at one point while the kid rains holy hell on them, you lose the ability to enjoy the slapstick comedy. For slapstick to work, the person has to be able to get back up from whatever level of pain being inflicted on them."
