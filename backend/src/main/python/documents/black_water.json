Jean-Claude Van Damme stars as a veteran CIA agent who is taken to a Black Site, which is a retrofitted former Navy sub, when he is thought to have changed sides. He will have to try and escape teaming with a new agent (Jasmine Waltz). They'll be plenty of surprises and double-crosses along the way. Dolph Lundgren has more of a secondary role, but does appear more often in the final third of the movie. Overall, some of the plot elements here are very non-believable but the film kept me engaged and I would say it's not a great movie but certainly watchable."}], "recommendations": ["jack_ryan_shadow_recruit", "momentum", "shooter", "kickboxer", "the_jackal", "hunter_killer", "killer_elite", "patriot_games", "lethal_weapon_3", "gangster_squad", "american_assassin", "tomorrow_never_dies", "21_bridges", "spy_game", "2_guns", "mission_impossible_rogue_nation", "survivor", "triple_9", "inside_man", "street_kings", "safe_house", "extraction", "the_spy_who_loved_me", "the_foreigner", "the_november_man"]}
