      "text": "This action flick was somewhat better than I expected, with all the poor reviews it has received. Jean-Claude Van Damme stars as a veteran CIA agent who is taken to a Black Site, which is a retrofitted former Navy sub, when he is thought to have changed sides. He will have to try and escape teaming with a new agent (Jasmine Waltz). They'll be plenty of surprises and double-crosses along the way. Dolph Lundgren has more of a secondary role, but does appear more often in the final third of the movie. Overall, some of the plot elements here are very non-believable but the film kept me engaged and I would say it's not a great movie but certainly watchable."
