      "text": "this is not a movie made to be digested by americans. no explosions, no CGI, no george clooney, no abc 123 training wheels plot. this is a painting of a path to sexual/pattern behavior slavery. the character may have been turned on at some point, but finds less and less fulfillment until he becomes a robot in a black suit who loses his ties to conventional society; eating garbage. hence the senseless finale. it is shot at night because that's where the character prowls... dear heavens, the comments here explain why Bush was elected. this is a movie about sexual repression turned mental illness; if you're looking for something else, go watch Transformers or the latest X-Men."

      "text": "It's a intelligent movie about the society \"despersonalization\" that occurs nowadays. It's about a man that communicates through his own body. A man that looks for somethin real in his life; It\u00b4s a really good movie."
