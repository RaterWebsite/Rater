The 70's washed out color scheme sets a great mood with these sets. I just wish this movie would make more money at the box office. It is a quality film much better than so many others released this year. Maybe it will get a few awards later bringing it more attention."

But the greatness of the film lies in its characterization of the psyches of its rival protagonists, Hunt and Lauda. The whole cast does an excellent job, but Bruhl as Lauda is absolutely superb. And the script gives Bruhl plenty to work with in making Lauda as complex as he does. An Oscar performance if there ever was one. One of the most convincing acting jobs I've ever seen in my life in a big-budget Hollywood film. One of the great Hollywood studio films of all time. Howard certainly deserves an Oscar."

I went into this expecting it to be a run of the mill racing film and wasn't expecting much from Hemsworth. Man was I wrong. Hemsworth delivers his best performance so far, the drama is genuine, the action is truly thrilling. It's a bit of a puff piece at times but not in a way that makes me roll my eyes. The part where Lauda returns to the track after his injury and finishes in fourth gave me genuine chills for the entire scene. I can't say how much I respect that about people. When they have a genuine passion for something and will do whatever it takes to continue doing what they love...for all the things I hate about people, this is something I truly respect."

From its brilliant script that infuses humor, drama, and a story about a fascinating rivalry to its impeccable and detailed oriented direction, this film succeeds on every level.\r Ron Howard\u2019s direction is extremely noteworthy as I felt like a part of the journey and involved with the characters as I cheered them on. In the beginning, I was rooting for James, but as the movie progresses and things unravel, I was cheering for Niki. However, as the movie moves forward, I couldn\u2019t choose one over the other. This is the type of engagement that I love in movies, it keeps the audience involved and contently thinking about every situation and the characters as a whole.\r This film is well edited and shot as well. I couldn\u2019t find a useless or uninteresting moment in this film. Everything flowed very well and the film moved at a brisk pace. It felt as every shot or sequence is catered to moving and developing the characters and their story forward. The racing sequences are well shot and make you feel a part of the race. My heart rushed when characters successfully made narrow life endangering turns. It is a really good film to look at as the scenery and environment crafted feels inviting and absorbing.\r The cast in this film is superb. Chris Hemsworth gives his finest performance to date as a carefree playboy. Even though his character James Hunt doesn\u2019t appear serious, he struggles with his inner demons trying to be taken a bit more seriously. Daniel Bruhl also gives and equally impressive, if not better, performance as Niki Lauda an arrogant self-absorbent racer. It\u2019s interesting to see his character go from caring only about himself and racing to something more important. The greatest aspect of the characters are their interactions. I really enjoy how they can\u2019t stand each other, but can\u2019t be successful without each other either. While they hate one another, they find a mutual respect for the other. It\u2019s quite endearing to see how they have each others back off the tracks.\r Overall, \u201cRush\u201d is an amazing movie and totally worth your time. It\u2019s a movie that has everything, from drama to humor to love. The greatest aspect of the film is its truly brilliant and masterful score by Hans Zimmer. His score gives the right amount of emotional punch along with improving everything we see and giving the film a greater amount of importance. I give this film an extremely high 4.5/5, a well oiled film that has no wasted parts."

I can't recommend it highly enough for F1 fans like me, sports fans, or anyone interested in a story of rivalry i.e. something different to the unoriginal junk movies which get churned out each year.\r All the crew involved should pat themselves on the back. They've done a fabulous job making this film critique, explore and honour two memorable F1 drivers.\r James Hunt's fun, party lifestyle along with his brash and raw driving talent. This is contrasted against Niki Lauda's methodical thinking, technical brilliance and professional lifestyle. These two characters are total opposites but as their lives are explored it also acknowledges the value of an enemy, i.e. something to beat. I believe this is a commentary on human nature in that the best of us shines when we have something to beat or overcome.\r Do yourself a favour and see it now"

      "text": "An entertaining account of the rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda. Rush starts slowly and in a somewhat formulaic manner but after about 40 minutes things kick into high gear and the movie soars. It helps that Peter Morgan's script has bite and rises above the average ambitions of this type of movie. Ron Howard is to be commended for his direction of another film which, whilst obviously having popular appeal,in no way aims for the lowest common denominator. He captures the high energy world of the race track perfectly and the quality here, as in most of his previous films, is apparent in every frame. Chris Hemsworth charismatically portrays Hunt, but it is really Daniel Bruhl who steals the show. His Lauda is definitely the more interesting character and his presence dominates, but doesn't over balance, the film. Technical achievements are aces. Point of view cinematography puts you excitingly on the track and first rate editing keeps you there. The sound is also great. Lovers of fast moving, good old fashioned styled movies with no axe to grind should rush to see it."

Howard is known for great directing and this shows in this film. I have seen some comments about how they used old race footage, but they should know the recreated most of what you see on the screen. It is amazing the attention to detail Howard and his crew did when making this film.\r I wish I could say I know the historical details to tell you how much is Hollywood fluff and how much is real, but I will say so far this seems very accurate. It is a based on a true story and do mean more then just 5% of it is based on a true story like some movies.\r The acting was good overall. Not only was the casting good, but the attention to detail with clothing, sets, cars, etc, is top notch. They did a great job creating that 1970s vibe.\r I appreciate that they did not not drag out the racing scenes. This is movie is about the people, not the cars. The racing scenes are very well done, but movie really does focus on the characters. Many automotive based movies become super cheesy, but Howard did a good job keeping it under control. There are few times is bordered on crossing the line.\r Yes, if you hate hearing the \"F\" word or seeing people use the middle finger, this film may offend you. Unlike movies who seem to use harsh language for no reason, this feels like how they really would have spoken. You will see short moments bare butts and breasts, but none of it us vulgar.\r If you are looking for a good drama with some action, this is a great movie. If you enjoy racing and do not know this story, you must see this movie. If you want to see the movie industry make a wider range of movies, then see this movie because no studio would have made this. If Ron Howard shows there is a market for more than popcorn and horror movies, then we may see more quality films of this level come out."

Don't get me wrong at all, the movie was good, but I cannot quite call it great, and interestingly enough, I sort of expected the warm, compelling figure to be Hunt, but Lauda is really the more sympathetic and interesting character to me, even before the stuff happens in the movie that might make you want to root for him.  Still a great rivalry, great story, I am actually changing my rating from an 8 to a 9 as I write this and think about the movie, definitely worth a watch whether you are an F1 fan or not.  One of the great things about the movie is that if the story wasn't true it would seem too \"Hollywood\" but it is true, and a great story."

Rush is probably one of the best films I\u2019ve seen this year, maybe even in my life. Rush is definitely one of my favorite films. I love the direction, the sound, the cinematography, acting and most importantly the story. It was incredible.\r The acting in this film is captivating. Daniel Br\u00fchl is incredible, he hits the perfect mark at playing Nicki Lauda. Br\u00fchl commands the screen whenever he is on it, his screen presence is incredible. To be honest I think that the performance delivered by Br\u00fchl in Rush is going to get him a nomination for an Academy Award for sure. Hemsworth delivers probably the best performance of his career, Hemsworth delivers a mesmerising performance as the ladies\u2019 man and talented driver James Hunt, and Hemsworth\u2019s charismatic performance gives the film that extra kick which pushes it into top gear.\r Another feature of the film which I love is the cinematography, I love the up close in action shots of the races. I love the use of the position of the camera in the actual position it was in when the crash happened. I loved the beautiful shots from inside the engine, the phantom camera footage of the inside of the engine working, I also loved the use of the footage of fuel being lit inside the engine.\r Ron Howard is one of my favorite directors, I love the way he can bring those fun little jokes and looks from the characters. I love the attention to detail and the way he makes even people like me who dislike Formula 1, sit on the edge of their seat during the races.\r I loved absolutely everything about the film Rush and here is to hoping that it picks up as many awards as possible and gets the recognition a film of this calibre deserves."

      "text": "\u201cRush\u201d is the true story of Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl), Formula One race car World Champ,  an Austrian born,  disciplined, mind on the prize, controlled and controlling of his life and career versus James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) a womanizing, smoking, drinking,  charismatic, dope taker who loved the spotlight, claimed to have bedded over 5,000+ women and wanted to take that World title from Lauda. The first hour of the film concentrates on their rivalry, most of all their differences, leading up to to 1976 when the last race would determine who was the champ.\r As an example of the difference between the two men we meet Suzy Miller (Olivia Wilde) who Hunt proposes marriage after knowing for her for a minute and two years later she leaves him and marries Richard Burton while Lauda meets Marlene (Alexandra Maria Lara) and his marriage proposal to her seems more of well thought out decision to become part of his all work and no play. Marlene\u2019s steadfast belief in Lauda changes the latter\u2019s life and leads to the horrific and hero building second half of the movie.\r Director Ron Howard, with the help of director of photography Anthony Dod Mantle and the editors Dan Hanley and Mike Hill, takes you into the center of the cars, and the races, to the point you almost feel you know what the drivers feel behind the wheel whether it be driving in bright sunshine or beating rain hitting your helmet. As Marlene is shown being given and plugging in ear plugs it might not hurt for you to bring a pair to the theatre. In addition to the deafening sound of the racing cars there is additional, unnecessary, noise added by the music of Hans Zimmer on the soundtrack.\r Peter Morgan, who wrote the screenplay, shows you the difference between Hunt and Lauda and will have you rooting for one and then the other but he fails in not giving a payoff to that rivalry for the audience to cheer and though there are other characters on screen he doesn\u2019t really give them any depth but they bring more to the screen than written. Alexandra Maria Lara gives off more looks than words but her looks are meaningful while Olivia Wilde is a portrait of  a 1970s jet setter. Members of the race teams add realism to the film and Pierfrancesco Favino, as real race car driver Clay Regazzoni,  who competed with Hunt and Lauda, provides humor and heft when each is needed.  Chris Hemsworth shines as James Hunt and Daniel Bruhl as Nick Lauda matches him as an opposite who seems to carry the world on his shoulders. The two actors carry the movie on their shoulders and do an excellent job.\r Don\u2019t forget to bring earplugs and some of you get ready to take your eyes from the screen during the crash and hospital scenes! Keep in mind it is a movie!"

      "text": "\u201cRush\u201d is about the real life fierce rivalry between Chris Hemsworth\u2019s character, James Hunt and Daniel Bruhl\u2019s Niki Lauda. Hunt and Bruhl were both formula 1 drivers during the 70\u2032s and the movie tells us what happened during the years they both raced against each other.\r Chris Hemsworth may never get the Thor- stamp off him (and that isn\u2019t that bad since those movies make tonnes of money) but he is genuinly great in this film and the best part is that he isn\u2019t Thor. Chris Hemsworth portrayes James Hunt brilliantly. Hunt is a reckless playboy who is willing to risk his life in a car. Not only does Chris look the part, he also acts just like you would imagine Hunt acting. Daniel Bruhl as Niki Lauda is the polar opposite of Chris as Hunt. He is the rich, good boy who goes to bed early and who doesn\u2019t party all night. However Lauda and Hunt are not only nice guys and playboys respectably. They are much more than that: Lauda is kinda douchy and not actually the nice guy you would have in a typical movie. Hunt is also troubled and you can, much thanks to Chris\u2019s performance, see the scared side of the character. I can only say that the characters and the actors are the best part of the movie.\r Ron Howard is a very underrated director. He is a two time Academy Award winning director and yet he\u2019s never really mentioned in the top. He is however directing this film incredibly well. The editing is also fantastic, Daniel P. Hanley and Mike Hill are really sharp, working with quick cuts, my favorite technique. There was a certain sequence in the movie where the race wasn\u2019t shown but the result were presented through text on the screen. That directing and editing trick caught me of guard and I admire the wat it was handled.\r \u201cRush\u201d isn\u2019t really about racing. It focuses on the characters more than the cars and that\u2019s how I want my sport movies. Similar to \u201cWarrior\u201d (a review for wich can be found on this very site) I don\u2019t care for the sport in it, I care about the overall story. That being said, the sound of the motors and the way the characters (I seem to constantly come back to the characters) behave towards the sport are great and they kinda made me an ounce interested.\r I contend that John Williams is the greatest composer ever but I also believe that the best soundtrack for a movie is the one for \u201cInception\u201d, \u201cInceptions\u201d score is composed by Hans Zimmer. He also composed \u201cRush\u201d. Zimmer crafts a score with might similar to a motor and  with the emotion and passion of the driver. It\u2019s a beautiful soundtrack.\r A surprisingly good thing about the film is the product placement. It gave a form of credibility to the 70\u2032s racing.\r The only real complaint I have about the film is how the relationship between Niki Lauda and James Hunt progresses. While the development is great I didn\u2019t really buy into the way they went from non-respect to respect. I saw how they tried to introduce the growing friednship but it didn\u2019t translate that well ont the screen.\r Overall, \u201cRush\u201d is an intense, thrilling ride (pun intended) with the right focus and no real big flaws. It\u2019s good to see more from Chris Hemsworth and even better that his range as an actor increases. The movie is far from predictable (but if you know about the real life events you obviously know how it\u2019ll end), something that is hard to pull of in a sports movie. Even if you don\u2019t like racing, I think you\u2019ll love \u201cRush\u201d."

From the choice soundtrack to Hunts flamboyant wardrobe the style effortlessly evokes the 1970\u2019s while resisting the temptation for nostalgia.The films greatest strength is the ambiguous nature with which it treats the central characters. Both Hunt and Lauda are presented as flawed, driven men, though completely different from one another in their approaches to the sport. It is never made clear who we are to root for and as the season has its ups and downs audience allegiances will turn almost from race to race.Hemsworth brings the same affable arrogance to Hunt as he did to his most famous creation but is also given an opportunity to add layers to the man and as the film progresses it becomes more and more clear that the cocksure attitude and flippant disregard for life frequently displayed by Hunt is only skin deep.Br\u00fchl\u2019s passionate Lauda drives the film with a sheer minded focus and determination that can at times be both admirable and incomprehensible.Through strong performances, dynamic direction and a sharp and evenly weighted script, Rush transcends its Formula One backdrop to focus on the nature of rivalry, sportsmanship and risk. Like all great rivalry films (see The Prestige, Warrior) it will split your allegiances, make you sympathize with and at times detest its characters and entertain regardless of your interest in the subject matter."

      "text": "Surprisingly really good and even it being a true story makes it even more amazing, the cast do really good for what they're given, especially James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki (Daniel Br\u00fchl) they give probably the best performances throughout. Also, the makeup artists do a fantastic job with certain characters and it honestly looks real for the most part, which is really good. Finally, the story is outstandingly brilliant and honestly there's some brutal and bloody scenes throughout this movie, which I wasnt expecting but it still adds to the movie being really good. Last thing here, I think the race scenes were quite fun and entertaining and I really liked them. Overall, I'd honestly say if you like true stories and racing movies, this is the movie for you. Its honestly, worth the watch."

While you might go into \"Rush\" thinking it's going to be Hemsworth's show, it's Daniel Br\u00fchl's unforgettable performance as his rival that has the most impact"

It's definitely a hollywood-type movie... that's a bit fluffy... but it's a lot of fun. I felt something for both the characters, was on the edge of my sit at moments during the race scenes... and was moved by the ending. The theater was full at last night's show... more than half the audience clapped at the end... as did I."

The performances are great, at times I was sitting on the edge of my seat, other times\rhaving a good chuckle and then other moments or actually feeling sad and sympathetic for the characters. Someone else said the audience clapped at the end of the movie, they did at my screening too.\rIt's pure entertainment, would have been a great summer blockbuster."

      "text": "It's a good, solid action flick, but not nearly as good as Senna from a few years back.  Supporting characters are merely ok. Daniel Bruhl as Nikki Lauda is an interesting and compelling figure that I wanted to know more about. His on-screen wife Alexandra Maria Lara is striking and outstanding, as usual. The visuals are extremely slick  if you have any interest in the sport, definitely check it out. Just keep your expectation in check  it's not a transcendent story."

      "text": "It took a while for me to decide if I actually enjoyed Rush or not  and eventually I concluded that any film that left me with such a mixed impression should be critiqued as such. While Daniel Br\u00fchl gives an outstanding performance, the direction is inconsistent and a lot of the beginning is very bland and cliche. Overall, the film had some very strong highliights, but there were some weaker moments that felt out of place. The main problem, oddly enough, can be solved with one small storytelling choice: Don't hide Lauda as the main character. Let him emerge as the star, and the rest would've fallen into place."

Rush, del veterano director Ron Howard, aparte de captar una narraci\u00f3n espl\u00e9ndida, tiene atr\u00e1s suya dos de las mejores interpretaciones del a\u00f1o, Chris Hemsworth como Hunt, y Daniel Br\u00fcl como Lauda. Una pel\u00edcula que recomendar\u00eda m\u00e1s que nada a las personas que disfruten del automovilismo en general, pues las escenas de carreras son magistrales en todos los sentidos. Muy seguro de mi mismo, digo que estamos ante una de las mejores pel\u00edculas del a\u00f1o 2013."
