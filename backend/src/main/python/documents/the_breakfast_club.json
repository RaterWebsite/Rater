There are some real dramatic scenes with confessions but that is what makes it real. My Favorite Character was Emilio Estevez. He is very sexy football player. That knows what he did was wrong but did it anyway. This is a life learning movie. I also don't like the fact that Bender Makes fun of Brian's life just because he is a nerd. Nothing wrong with being smart. Just remember that. But the dancing scene is fun, and the classic \"Running through the halls scene\" Check it out and let me know what you think of this 80s classic."

      "text": "This is a great look at high school life. As with real life, everybody has a story and inner demons, whether they show them frequently or not. Everybody is also divided based on \"status\" and rarely get to actually talk to people from other \"cliques\", as is shown here. That is what makes this film so special, as it breaks down those walls and allows everyone from every different clique to really see the others as they truly are: people just like them. However, what I really liked about the film is one of the discussions they have at the end, where they discuss how their friendships will be once detention ends. This discussion really rings true as I think everybody knows that these kids will never see one another afterwards and, if they do, they may ignore them or mock them after seeing them because of high school social pressures. While this one is a very accurate representation of high school and all of its oddities, it is also very funny. At many times, I found myself laughing quite hard at something somebody said or did. Overall, this is a very good film and I feel ashamed for just watching it now."

If Ferris Bueller's Day Off was the lighter side of high school with some of the dark bits, The Breakfast Club (also written by John Hughes) was the darker side of high school with some of the lighter bits. It is so dark at time dwelling into the psyche of the characters but its at the same time so incredibly funny. Each character is done so well and each has their own story arc. Brian gains some friends, Andrew learns to accept other people, Claire learns to love, Allison learns to act in society, Bender gets accepted by other people, and even the principal learns to understand that he is just like the students. My only real problem is the end of the movie for two characters. And without giving away any spoilers, it isn't really fulfilling, especially with the connection the two build in the movie, that's my opinion at least."

      "text": "The Breakfast Club\rYou would think that the 1985 film The Breakfast Club would be about breakfast lovers, but prepare to be thoroughly surprised. This film appeals to an audience of all mature ages with its adult humor and abundance of emotions being thrown at you at once. Even though the humor may not appeal to everyone, the meaning behind this film is definitely a classic that can be enjoyed by everyone. From the beginning to the epic ending, the entire story line has a smooth flow that tells the story of five different characters coming together. The audience will also notice how the writer, John Hughes, used pathos in his work so that the audience could really relate to the characters and their stories they tell. This is one of those films that will definitely have the audience intrigued and wanting more.\rEmilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, and Ally Sheedy play the main characters portrayed in this film. Throughout the film, you can tell the actors all work very well together and perfectly depict their roles. In this film the five main characters act as \u201ca brain\u201d, \u201can athlete\u201d, \u201ca basket case\u201d, \u201ca princess\u201d, and \u201ca criminal\u201d, who come together for Saturday detention. At first the group doesn\u2019t get along but throughout the film they come together to become a close group of acquaintances who call themselves \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d. Due to all these different types of characters, all kinds of audiences can relate to the emotional connection these characters represent. In the film, the character Andrew Clark played by Emilio Estevez says, \u201cWe\u2019re all pretty bizarre. Some of us are just better at hiding it, that\u2019s all\u201d. One of the main themes of this movie is that no matter how different a group of people are, they can still come together and learn to understand one another.\rThe story line of this film is nearly flawless. Every scene flows and never has a dull moment. Each character has a different story to tell that eventually we find out near the end of the film. With each story comes an overwhelming flow of emotion. The audience can see that John Hughes used pathos to connect with his audience, and it works. For example, Emilio Estevez who plays the athlete named Andrew Clark comes out to say he doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s ever good enough for his father\u2019s standards which hits home with a lot of people and they connect with it. In one scene, Judd Nelson who plays John Bender, says \u201cScrews fall out all the time, the world is an imperfect place\u201d. Even though the group doesn\u2019t know that much about each other, they support each other emotionally because they all have feelings and know what it\u2019s like to feel like that. This is one of the most moving and memorable scenes in the film.\rThe way this movie was filmed, also known as the camera viewpoint, plays a big part in how well this movie was produced. The actor\u2019s facial expressions, physical emotions, and line delivery also play a huge part in the pathos stated in the previous paragraph, and help justify how powerful and moving this film really is. You can tell that the actors really connected with their character and are seeing themselves become their character when they speak. The actors use a lot of their emotion to portray how their character is feeling at that time and place depending on the scene. There is also what\u2019s called symbolic images which is when filmmakers direct the attention of the audience to the deeper underlying approach the film is taking. An example of this is when Claire, played by Molly Ringwald tells John Bender, played by Judd Nelson, to stop back talking the principal so he will not get in any more trouble and in attempt to protect him. Little does the audience know, a romance will bloom between the two. The director also uses audio techniques to really connect with the audience. In the final scene right before the film cuts off to the credits, John Bender is walking across the football field while the song \u201cDon\u2019t You (Forget About Me)\u201d by Simple Minds is playing and Bender sticks his fist in the air. Making this scene one of the most iconic scenes in all film history, because everyone will think of that scene when they hear this song.\rFor me personally, this movie taught me multiple different life lessons in what felt like a very fast 98 minutes. It teaches the audience that no matter how different you may think a group of people are, they can still have things in common and you find the best of friendships with each other. This film also teaches that you can find romance in the strangest types of people. The criminal ends up falling for the preppy girl who thinks of herself as a princess while the athlete falls for the basket case. All in all, the film is not only a comedy with plenty of drama, but a film that we can all take something from, regardless of age.\rAlthough this is a phenomenal film, some may argue that it is inappropriate for some ages. While the film is rated R, there is many sexual references and vulgar language throughout the film making it ill-suited for younger viewers. For example, one scene Bender is being very descriptive about being intimate with a girl while talking to Claire, clearly making her uncomfortable. This movie is highly recommended for mature viewers or younger viewers with their parents\u2019 consent since it can be slightly raunchy at some parts of the film, for certain age groups.\rIn conclusion, The Breakfast Club can appeal to all types of viewers since it contains all kinds of humor. Not only is the story line flawless, but it\u2019s one of the most moving films ever produced. With the use of pathos, John Hughes has done a fantastic job connecting his audience to tangible feelings in his film. Not only just with emotions, but the way the movie was filmed just adds to the experience and the lessons this film puts out."

      "text": "The incredible thing about this movie is that the premise seems so incredibly boring, and it could have been so incredibly boring, but it isnt! The Breakfast Club is a warm, insightful and hilarious movie about a group of seemingly polar opposites of each other.\rThis is a character driven performance piece, despite only starring young actors and a always hilarious **** teacher and a delightfully innocent janitor who sometimes walks into scene. But what mostly keeps this movie together is not the fantastic script, but the engaging, interesting, hilarious **** of a character, beautifully portrayed by Judd Nelson called ''John Bender'', every scene he is in (quite alot), he steals the show. He is just so engaging, your eyes are glued to him whenever he says or does something, it is Judd Nelson who is unforgettable as Bender that acts as the catalyst of everyone's emotions.\rOn top of that the last half hour of The Breakfast Club, is truly incredible, emotional and heartbreaking. Every actor in this film shows their true potential there, and oh boy do they all shine.\r With ''The Breakfast Club'', John Hughes shows us once again why he is the king of 80's comedies."

Admittedly none of the kids revelations are all that surprising, and critics would argue that everything is perhaps wrapped up a little too neatly, but The Breakfast Club is a still a movie that lives up to its lofty reputation."

When a movie depends too much on the script, you have to make it great in order to make a great production (a great example on a movie that depends on the screenplay and does it fantastic is \"Before Sunset\"). Sometimes when the characters were expressing their feelings i really saw them forced, and predictable and as a thing that plays an important role (script) it was supposed to make me understand the characters and their motives and it failed at that. The character development was fine, but i really didn't felt that they were that interesting as they try to make them look like, because of that i really got bored at some parts, but that doesn't mean i didn't enjoy it. I did but i think this movie is a little overrated"

      "text": "The Breakfast Club is an incredibly vibrant coming of age story that is just so incredibly honest that you cannot help but love it. The film tells the story of five high school kids who get Saturday detention. These five are however completely different. There is the Brain (Anthony Michael Hall), The Basket Case(Ally Sheedy), The Princess (Molly Ringwald), The Athlete (Emilio Estevez) and The Criminal (Judd Nelson). Over the course of the film each and every one of them discovers something new about each other.It seems a little formulaic but in a way its the teen film that built the formula. John Hughes once again took a simplistic plot premise and made it so incredibly detailed and intelligent much like he did with Sixteen Candles. However the greatest part of The Breakfast Club is its tone. The tone of the film goes from dark to light in a blink of an eye, it allows for some of the character reveals to feel shocking and real at the same time. The tone allows for pure joy and fun (the iconic dance sequence) while also allowing for some utterly upsetting character moments (Judd Nelsons depiction of life in the Bender household for instance). Its a film that knows exactly what it wants to do while also making it relate-able for its target audience. In the hands of a lesser director this film would seem generic but Hughes makes it iconic while also thoroughly entertaining."

Something almost piecemeal about the central line of action (or lack thereof, rather) that really made me buy the fact that Hughes wrote this in such a short period of time. The matrix of character relationships, however, is what makes this movie really sail by, and the respective performances from Nelson, Ringwald, Hall, Estevez, and Sheedy all really do help in the end. Again, not a movie that I didn't like, just one that I feel hype may have ultimately undercut for me overall."

It isn't a perfect film I agree as admittedly the characters are clich\u00e9d and there are minor logic lapses, but here's the thing- the more I see The Breakfast Club the more I like it. It still has its freshness, and while I never had a detention when I was in school even from what I've heard from people who have this actually makes detentions cool. And it is still relevant not only to the teenagers back then but now too, it does ring true a vast majority of the time what with its justified grievances, self-pitying whinges and hard-hitting home truths. The cinematography is nice and fluid, typical Hughes really, and the soundtrack adds to the film's coolness. Hughes directs wonderfully, and the script and story are well written and I think memorable. While their characters are clich\u00e9d, that I agree, the cast do a great job with what they have. Emilio Estevez, Judd Nelson, Ally Sheedy, Anthony Michael Hall and especially Molly Ringwald give very appealing performances and interact well together.

Trapped in a day-long Saturday detention in a prison-like school library are Claire, the princess (Molly Ringwald); Andrew, the jock (Emilio Estevez); John, the criminal (Judd Nelson); Brian, the brain (Anthony Michael Hall); and Allison, the basket case (Ally Sheedy). These five strangers begin the day with nothing in common, each bound to his/her place in the high school caste system. Yet the students bond together when faced with the villainous principal (Paul Gleason), and they realize that they have more in common than they may think, including a contempt for adult society. \"When you grow up, your heart dies,\" Allison proclaims in one of the film's many scenes of soul-searching, and, judging from the adults depicted in the film, the teen audience may very well agree. Released in a decade overflowing with derivative teen films, The Breakfast Club has developed an almost cult-like status.\rMy Review\rMan i have been wanting to see this film for quite a while now, and finally I did. I wanted to see this film cause it is one of the pivotal 80's films along with some of my other favorite films like ET, Jaws, and Back to the Future. I have been trying to buy the DVD copy since I saw it at a store and i finally bought it and i have seen it and it is a masterpiece.\rThe Plot has to deal with five kids with nothing in common all in a detention room on one saturday and they all learn about each other throughout the film and become better friends.\rin the opening sequence you meet your characters and find out a little bit about them like how Andrew's the jock,Brian's the brain,John's the criminal, Claire the princess, and Allison the basket case.\rThe movie is great on an exponential level with it's characters. They are the pivotal part of the movie. These are characters are so well written that you either know or are like someone that are just like one of these characters. This movie has the pivotal 80's soundtrack a person would want in a movie. The film is something that should be seen along with another High School movie called The Perk's of Being a Wallflower which is similar to this along with two other John Hughes classics I will be checking out sometime soon named Sixteen Candles and Ferris Bueller's Day Off. You feel for these characters cause you can probably relate to them that's the point of High School movies like this and these are very good high school movies were you feel like you either know or are one these characters that's what makes a great high school movie. I have not seen any of his other films but this already my favorite John Hughes film. But I will be sure to check out some of his other movie's.\rIn the end there isn't much i can say then what I already have. This movie is my second favorite High school movie of all time I like the characters i feel for the characters this movie has an awesome soundtrack and I think it's a masterpiece I give The Breakfast Club a 5 out of 5."

It is just impossible to not relate with pretty much everything in this movie, every single teenager that are in this movie you most likely know people from school or even college that are just like them, and surely you will identify yourself in one of them, or a bit of you in all of them possibly, it is characteristics that i have had in almost every class that i have been during my life, the most different people, and a lot of them i didn't really knew what was going on in their lifes or how were they relationship with families and things that they might be going throught, and this movie did showed me that we had much in common that i expected, that bad people had a reason to be like that in school, not everybody is what it looks like, and surely not only what it looks like, no one is just black or white in a psych meaning, everybody have a lot of shades, and the way that this story exemplifies this, isn't just clear made in a movie perspection, but it helps us to change our minds in other people.Inchmeal that the story progresses we got to know more about them next to the same, so in first we have the same vision together as the characters, we only know things superficially, and inch by inch, with the strong and powerful dialogues that we have we got know more about them, and definely understand things way more clearly, during this process the reason that it is so important for us, is because we can see how are issues that doesn't matter if you are rich or poor, strong or weak, things happen to everybody. One of the main situations that is approached by this story, is how parents and adults can be destructive, how bad parents could be to children and how they would, and are, affected by things that parents do, you hear by each one of them, and definely everybody have had moments with this during our lifes, some could be exaggerated and some don't, but the true is that things like this go through the head of everyone at some point.It is great how the characters had the others back, even if they don't really rock with them, the interaction between them are so great, and at the same time very real, are things that i did or i could see happening.Another strong thing that it is very common between the adolescence, is that how necessary it is to be inside of a group and get accepted by that, the film talks about it and exemplify how suffering that could be, the fear of not being accepted and the needed to be part of something, and how bad can be the necessity to stay there, even when you gotta do things that you don't really wants to. They also put how easy it is to regret of something, do something to impress someone or something like that, but when you actually get to know how bad it was, or seing in the other side, seing things from other perspective, that was really nice.Judd Nelson was phenomenal in here, he could first give that student that apparently don't really care about anything, and then he gave him layers, he is sarcastic, funny, scrotum and have his manneirsms, he is authentic and can finally, after that all, give that image of sadness.Molly Ringwald could gave that pretty and rich girl aspect, and had some nice dialogues where she put her emotions out well. Ally Sheedy was really nice in here, without speaking much, she was myterious and had some really peculiar moments while she did strange things, you got interested to know more about her during the whole movie. Emilio Estevez did a nice job as well, he was strong and convinced me in his regret moments. Anthony Michael Hall is also really good, he could pass that innocence and vulnerability, so as his sadness and trouble with the personal life.It does have some problems, like some cuts feel so unnatural, there are somethings that was disruptive, moments that were from emotional from a completely different thing with no working, but that is a small thing compared to the whole thing."

No plot at all.  No gun battles, no car chase, no explosions... no three-act structure! Breaks all the strict rules of screenwriting and industry structure requirements -- but still ranks as one of the greatest films of the 80s.  Bravo!"

His directorial work is appreciative but deserved a better supervision compared to its script. The performance wasn't up to the mark which is the only thing that itches one down the throat in this old classic. The Breakfast Club is a typical teenage movie retold in the most intriguing way that it is almost impossible not to invest in it and be moved by it (no matter how much familiar their tales may sound but the impact doesn't grow shallow at all)."

      "text": "I had pretty low expectations for this movie, as I don't really like teen movies. However, I must admit that the film is good and well-made. It's not perfect or exceptional, but it works and entertains without our time being wasted. I can understand why so many people consider this movie a classic, but I don't agree. It's not such a good movie to have that designation, and it has maintained a certain aura to this day, this is due to a certain cult status it has acquired over the years. The film takes place in a school on a Saturday, in which five students who do not know each other will be grounded, each for their own reasons. The teacher, however, is an idiot, and they will end up enjoying the day, listening to music, talking and discovering that they are not so different from each other.The film has weaknesses, starting with the thin script it presents. In fact, there is no story or action here. If the movie didn't have so many humorous scenes or where the characters escape and walk around the school, we would have an hour and a half of dialogue. Another problem is the use of all the most common stereotypes in high school movies: we have an idiotic teacher with no authority, a rebellious student with problems at home, a good student under pressure to have good grades, a beautiful and smug student from a wealthy family, an athletic student with anger issues, and a lonely, weird student. The only thing that saves them is, deep down, the way they gain depth and personality as the dialogues flow. And could I still speak of the illogicality of this punishment, in which five troubled students are left alone in a deserted school?Regardless of the script's weaknesses and other issues, the film has a young cast that does a very committed and interesting job. Of them all, the one who impressed me the most was Judd Nelson, who managed to impart a genuine rebelliousness and irreverence to his character. I also really liked Ally Sheedy. She starts the film almost silently, letting her pose, and bizarre costume dominate our attention, but then she presents us with an intense, intelligent and pleasantly unpleasant and sarcastic character. Anthony Hall has a more palatable and emotional character, which he plays satisfactorily, as do Molly Ringwald and Emilio Estevez, and they also worked well in their respective characters. A word, more, for Paul Gleason, and the impeccable way in which he played a mediocre teacher.Technically, it's a low-key film. It has good cinematography and was very well shot, with sharpness and good colors. It doesn't feature great visual or special effects, but what it brings us is well done and works pleasantly. The library set was well-built, and the school is credible. But what amazes us is, clearly, the soundtrack, and particularly the theme song \"Don't You (Forget About Me)\", which is heard in the credits and which became one of the biggest hits of that decade, in that many were young or (like me) born."

The acting the kids did was pretty good and I found it both funny and kinda odd that they kept switching from comedy to drama to comedy and then drama. The romance part was pretty bad and didn't really had any part in the movie except in the end (which fell forced as **** Give it a check just to see how good those kids are at acting."

      "text": "Although The Breakfast Club is the lynchpin of the brat pack movies this film is a lot more than teen comedy. I'd even go so far as to call it one of the finest films of its kind that came out during that era. The Breakfast Club is very different from almost every other entry into what was (at the time) a burgeoning genre. Instead of relying on the staples of bare flesh, crass humor, and brainless plots, this movie focuses on five dissimilar characters, is almost entirely dialogue-driven, and doesn't offer even a glimpse of a breast or buttock. It's a story about communication gaps, teen isolation, and the angst that everyone (regardless of how self-assured they seem) experiences during the years that function as a transition from the freedom of adolescence to the responsibilities of adulthood.(Evocative description of high school life)."
