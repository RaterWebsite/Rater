      "text": "Vanquish: You probably never heard of this movie that\u2019s a good thing. Why you may ask because it\u2019s dull, I know I shouldn\u2019t compare but look at John Wick for instance why do we love the movies the characters, the action and the world. The movie only has the actors nailed Ruby Rose and Morgan Freeman have proven they are talented especially Freeman in Hitman\u2019s Wife\u2019s Bodyguard, not to mention his tons more films like Seven. But here he\u2019s just doing it for the pay I can tell his performance is so dull it\u2019s not even worth it for him. Rose does good but still lifeless. The action good god it\u2019s just boring there\u2019s a motorcycle chase that goes on for way to long, let alone barely any action to begin with just dull. Take again Wick Chapter 3 there\u2019s a motorcycle chase and it\u2019s about 4 minutes full of action, long takes and it\u2019s just fun to watch. Here though nobody is fighting back and it\u2019s not fun to watch I was waiting for it to end. Now my main gripe with this movie is the editing because they do some either clich\u00e9 edits or down right stupid like a kid discovering how to make cool transitions in PowerPoint it\u2019s terrible, not to mention the dumb green filter like your looking at a GameBoy screen up close. Overall this is a not very good movie shoty editing, dull action and acting, a generic plot of I want you to do something for me, person refused, other person takes something from that person and they now do it, just don\u2019t watch this it\u2019s not worth it. Ranking Bad."
