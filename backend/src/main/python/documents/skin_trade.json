      "text": "The action is great, and the film has a solid cast as well. But, Skin Trade isn't as good as I thought it would be. The story, which revolves around cops fighting the horrific human trafficking, is bare bones, cheesy and wafer thin. Notably, Ron Perlman as Viktor Dragovic was the only reason Skin Trade excels on the villain side of things. Overall, it has the guts to be a big budget sellout, but this sleazy action flick is only fun with the guys over on a Friday movie/pizza night. It doesn't have any other value than that."
