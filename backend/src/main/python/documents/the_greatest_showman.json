This was definitely a fun, well-meaning, and upbeat feel-good musical. With that being said however, it was pretty formulaic and predictable for the most part, and some of the songs were rather mediocre (I personally found 'This is Me' to be rather overrated and not particularly memorable), but I will say that most of them were very good. Hugh Jackman, Zac Efron, Michelle Williams, and the rest of the cast we're all a delight to watch of course too. Overall, it wasn't anywhere near what the critics would have you believe it is, but it also wasn't spectacular either in my opinion. It was just a very upbeat and well-made film that put a smile on my face for enough of it."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Is not every movie that makes me smile from the minute one.

Go see it."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "The Greatest Showman is a visual treat and just that. I heard mediocre reviews from the critics and everyone else has just absolutely adored it, I'm in the middle. It was entertaining and the characters were pretty entertaining, but it focused more on the glamour than anything. This movie hoodwinked us just like the show hoodwinked its audience. I don't believe that this story was all just wonder, glamour, and singing. We did get to see a little bit of the dirty stuff behind it, such as the social prejudice. Other than that, this was just a fairly entertaining movie. I didn't feel moved when I left the theater, I left thinking that that was just fine.

Let's focus on musical accompaniment at the center of this story based on real events."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "The Greatest Showman is, in itself, a carnival of a movie. Anything you can say against a carnival can be said against this movie. The story was not the best in the world, the special effects were sometimes a bit wonky looking, and it was quite a bit fake when it came to telling the story of P. T. Barnum. However, this also applies vice versa, as this movie perfectly captures magic and shows it to the audience. The music in the movie is incredible, the choreography is amazing, the interaction between Barnum and his daughters is magical. Heck, even the wonky special effect only make this movie seem more fantastical!All in all, this movie captures the magic of the carnival, along with the downsides that go along with it. If you are willing to look past the inconsistencies that go along with it, be prepared for a magical experience whose music will be stuck in your head all day and bright colors will make you have a smile nearly permanently plastered on your face."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "What is the job of a film critic.I thought it was to guide us, the paying public, on what we should spend our time and money on.

You slate a film and instead of people agreeing with you, the word spreads like wild fire that it's a must see !And as for the critics who wrote \" it won't be remembered for very long\".When the stage musical comes out ( as it surely will ) and people are standing and cheering, they are going to look like complete fools  , just like the ones who back in the day said Les Miserables wouldn't  last more than six weeks!"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Great story, plotline, soundtrack.

If you a history buff as I am, you appreciate the story that surrounded P.T. Barnum's approach to taking people shunned by the real world an making a show with them. The songs and the scenes that accompany them are fun for people of all ages. There wasn't much that I was left unhappy with after I left the movie theater, other than I wish it had been longer.

I didn't expect the first 25 min would be entirely singing, I came into the movie knowing nothing about it also. But I thought the movie told the story of PT greatly. Favorably speaking i wish Zendaya had more of an important role than she did, i also thought Zac Efron played his role very well. Overall the movie was great, the characters showed their talent and portrayed their characters very well. I would advise everyone to watch it, especially if you are a musical fan. I am not sure if it is worth the $10+ to see it, so I will advise either seeing it on a deal day depending on your movie theater, or waiting till it is on Netflix/Redbox."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "I went into the theater not knowing much about this film. This musical left me astounded and wanting more. The catchy songs, brilliant sets, great cast and flashy scenes really caught my attention. This movie left me wanting to know more about P.T. Barnum and the people he worked along side with. Unfortunately, many of the events that took place during the film are not exactly historically accurate. All things aside, the lack of historically accuracy did not take away much from the film. The \"musical\" aspect of the film was not overwhelming and appealed to all people in my party at the theater and not just the musical fans. The story line is simply accompanied with music sung by the cast that is relevant to what is going on in the film. It is not too \"Musically\". I believe that the movie was beautifully casted and would not look to change much about that."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I have no idea why critics crapped all over this film.

It's fast-paced, well written, and the music is superb. I forgot that Hugh Jackman was in Les Miserables, which also was great. The theme of the movie unravels slowly but gets its' point across. The cast was excellent. The only point that I would make is that you should watch it in the theatre. I watched it at home, and the small screen (relative to a movie screen) just does not compare.

(This review is completely honest by the way.) Anyways, I love this movie so much and the critics were really harsh on this movie. I love this movie so much and the songs are super catchy. The plot line isn't like the actual real life story. I mean its a movie, come on guys it's not a big deal! The dances and the choreography was quite decent. My children loved the movie so much and I loved the movie so much! It will be one of my favorites!! Some parts made P.T. Barnum seem like a good guy but in real life he wasn't the best man. I did like what they turned P.T. Barnum! I don't mind that the whole story in the movie isn't based of the true story. If it was then it would be a really depressing musical and that would be a thumbs down. My overall review would be that I really really liked the movie and I feel that you should do, the songs are super catchy and get stuck in your head. The story had some inspiration and some romance (no sexual scenes) the movie is great for kids. P.S. ONE OF MY FAVORITE SONGS IS THE OTHER SIDE BY THE WAY!"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "I was reluctantly pulled along to see this movie to join my family and I found myself loving this movie.

Do yourself the favor of pissing off a critic and taking your family to see this movie."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I've given this movie a 10 because I just couldn't fault it. It does exactly what it sets out to do - to put on a glorious show in circus style, exciting, musical, theatrical, maybe a little dangerous, a big-top containing a little world apart from the reality of day to day life. You know as you are watching that it's all done with mirrors; that any connection with the history is tenuous, that there is a real story somewhere outside that is much less bright and shiny; you know its all fake. But, who cares? - its the circus and it's fun. You will walk out humming and wanting to dance.I also thought the film was cleverer than it first appears - asking some genuine questions about what is real and what is not when it comes to entertainment. Critics have got it wrong.Enjoy."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Didn't bother to see this when my wife and daughter went last week, primarily because of the low metacritic score, but they raved about it and I saw it this week and was blown away.

This is one you'll end up seeing more than once."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "The critics are totally missing the point of this movie. It's a beautiful old fashioned musical. It's not a biopic or a historical documentary. The word of mouth is great, as it should be.

The best thing are the musical sequences and the songs. They're amazing with a amazing and hyperactive mode and the performances are great. The rest is just fine, whit a result of a good movie. Not the best, but is a movie that is entretaining and fun for the fans of musicals movies. In other words, is a better version of Illumination's Sing."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Check your cynicism at the door as Hugh Jackman and cast are the perfect antidote to the dourness of 2017. The film and it\u2019s music are a celebration of everything that is good, true friendship, not looking to others for your self worth and not living life as a consumer but as a giver. Loved this last theme, as the movie shows Barnum almost lose everything he\u2019s built because of his selfish using of people to prop himself up.

I have never written a review, and usually kinda blas\u00e9 about this kind of movie.  I went because she wanted to see it and I have been back 3 times to watch it, and am going again for the 4th time. I haven't even seen that many movies in 4 years and those were Star Wars and Jumanji. Each time I go I take someone new. A great spectacle, unbelievable camera work and I have no words for the music and choreography.  I woke up after first seeing it with the music in my head, like what??? But immediately bought it and everyone who has seen the movie or ridden with me loves the soundtrack. I know a lot of critics harp on how awful Barnum really was, but that has squat to do with this movie. This is entertainment, not a biography. Pure fun rollicking make you move, sing, smile, laugh entertainment. And I saw one 0 review, they hated the music and the dancing.  I know every one has different tastes, but I know for a fact I would not like that person. Wow, seriously?  If this can't make you enjoy yourself for a bit of time and the song and dance, I really would be scared to meet you. This is heartwarming, fun, has good messages for this day and time and is one of the top 3 movies I have ever seen. Don't listen to naysayers, they are all dead inside if they aren't even a bit positively affected by this show."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "\u201cThe Greatest Showman\u201d is definitely great in most parts with it\u2019s flashy and fast paced-fun musical scenes to it\u2019s deep and heart pouring drama scenes with just a great A-List cast and crew in this spectacular production. With Michael Gracey directorial debut, he definitely knew how to open up a show. Visually this movie is stunning with multiple incredible shots of the circus in action with various musical scenes scattered throughout in various locations and it\u2019s very witty and fun cast to backup this colorful movie making it stand out from the rest of these serious and deep \u2018oscar bait\u2019 movies coming out before the end of the year. Casting wise everything was amazing. Hugh Jackman put in another perfect performance as the legendary P.T. Barnum with his golden musical voice and cheering smile. With both him looking ragged and practically homeless to being practically prince material he pulls it off to the tee. Alongside with Michelle Williams giving a great performance as his push and support throughout the film and his guide to what he really needs in the world. Even the other cast; Zac Efron coming back into singing where he started with disney amung with Zendaya from the same network, Rebecca Ferguson and Keala Settle both giving full heart and even one spotting one hell of a beard for this film. Singing wise everyone did their own voices and it fit perfectly, my biggest worry going into any musical is the production dubbing in another person\u2019s voice and it just not fitting at all. The sets were beautiful between it\u2019s homeless side of the story in the first act to the gorgeous ballrooms and fancy mansions shown throughout the rest of the film as well. The sets also played great places for the cast to sing and dance to. My personal favorite being the first bar scene in the film with the song choice and the choreographed dance scene was just beautiful. Even the dance scenes with every act on the stage was amazing with the long single takes and the amount of objects moving was beautiful. With the use of CGI to build some of the bigger views of the city and some of the landscape, it seems seamless with the match of practical built sets and real props. The story was great overall, the songs came in at the best parts to drive the raw emotion into the film. The pacing was overall really well done with some small parts that felt dragged out. But immediately followed by an amazing dance sequence or another singing piece. And even when the singing isn\u2019t going on they have a beautiful score to keep the pace and drive of the film rolling just as fast as the trapeze performers in the film. With multiple romances of all different degrees and the build of what has sadly closed recently, the circus is something everyone should (or should have) experienced in their lives one time or another and with it gone \u201cThe Greatest Showman\u201d is a great substitute to that void that many people will have. My biggest problem with the film has to be that a few sequences of time passing could\u2019ve been stretched out with possibly another dance number or something to show the struggle of it being built instead of it just being there out of nowhere. And then there were a few scenes that were dragged out a bit that were attempted to be corrected by a musical number. But for a first time director he did a brilliant job with this warm-hearted circus filled musical."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "The music, message and acting were great. Cried a few times.

Barnum said such things as \u201canother sucker is born every minute\u201d. There is no denying that he was a swindler and a con man.Yet I ask how petty one must be to disregard a movie made with a love adamant in every frame, made for the love of telling a whimsical story, made to bring those who feel out of place together in a profound unity, simply because it is not historically accurate?The Greatest Showman is a film celebrating the strength and whimsy of humanity. It is a film made to show people with scars and that they are proud of such scars. In every single frame there is a love and passion and dedication that shines through that I have not seen in so many years.Please, I beg you to go see this movie.

This movie is sooooo autotuned. The story is just awful. P.T Barnum was also racist in real life. He was so unlikable in this movie. I love Broadway and almost every musical.

Guess what? They are right. The Greatest Showman is a stunning achievement that is being marginalized for its crowd pleasing tendencies.  I am going to compare this to La La Land in which the former has reinvogarated the musicals, yet have casts, brilliant that they were who couldn't sing or dance.  The Greatest Showman, Jackman included, is the complete opposite.  These are casts that are more suited to a musical, with singing and dancing skills on the level on any Broadway shows around.  Headlining this is obviously Jackman himself in a tour de force performance, singing and dancing away.  This along with stellar casting: Michelle Williams, Zach Efron, Zendaya and the rest made this an unforgettable experience.

The costumes could have been made by Edith Head or Adrian and the story could have been written by one of the contract writers.The main difference between the 1950s musical and \u201cThe Greatest Showman\u201d are the songs by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul along with the choreography of Ashley Wallen which are strictly 2017! The songs will have you clapping and toe-tapping right along with the dancing.The main similarity of the musical movies of yesteryear and \u201cThe Greatest Showman\u201d is that they entertain and with all the talent involved this one certainly entertains.Hugh Jackman, as P. T. Barnum, has proven on both stage and in films that he is a class A song and dance man who can stand side by side with the greats of yesterday. He has a good dance partner in Zac Efron who could be Donald O\u2019Connor to Jackson\u2019s Gene Kelly. They have a song, \u201cThe Other Side\u201d, set in a bar and choreographed with shot glasses that are good as any song and dance number you will find in movies.Michelle Williams as Barnum\u2019s wife adds accolades of singing and dancing to her long list of credits while Keala Settle, as The Bearded Lady Lettie, belts out \u201cThis is Me\u201d which is the theme song of Barnum\u2019s circus.Aside from the love story which opens the movie showing the young Phineas (Ellis Rubin) and Charity (Skylar Dunn) with the song \u201cA Million Dreams\u201d up to them as adults there is the love story between wealthy Phillip Carlyle (Efron) and Black trapeze artist Anne Wheeler (played by Zendaya) causing some backlash from the city citizens but also offering \u201cRewrite The Stars\u201d as they do tricks in the center ring.The story, for what it is worth, serves the purpose of introducing the songs that keep the movie moving, entertaining the audience and, as Barnum did, give the public the razzle-dazzle that puts a smile on your face.\u201cThe Greatest Showman\u201d has something for everyone (except sex and 4 letter words!) and delivers with stars, songs, dances and even bit of a \u2018drama\u2019 that will be forgotten quickly though the songs will remain. You will leave the movie with a smile on your face and what more do you want this time, or anytime, of the year."}], "recommendations": ["in_the_heights", "cats", "moulin_rouge", "the_sound_of_music", "la_la_land", "jingle_jangle_a_christmas_journey", "bohemian_rhapsody", "almost_famous", "hairspray", "begin_again", "yesterday", "mamma_mia_here_we_go_again", "burlesque", "vivo", "rocketman", "sweeney_todd_the_demon_barber_of_fleet_street", "sing_street", "into_the_woods", "sing_2", "chicago", "work_it", "trolls", "strange_magic", "casablanca", "we_are_your_friends"]}
