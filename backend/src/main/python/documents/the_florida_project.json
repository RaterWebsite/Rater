I was fortunate enough to have at least had my own bed and a kitchen in the small 2 bedroom apartment that slept 5 of us. I had other friend who slept in the closet of the master bedroom because their family had 7 people. Our parents were mostly neglectful and we left the house from morning til night. It wasn't half as bad as the situation here, but I can relate and it felt very real.This is a wonderfully acted, far too real look into a poverty stricken group of people who get by one day at a time. It's heartbreaking and tense. Cinematography and colors are beautiful despite the mess of a life."

The acting is first rate, but the director, Sean Baker, should be commended for bringing out the best in all of them.  Don't be fooled by the low ratings here given by people saying that \"nothing happens\" because you will miss out on a wonderful film exposing a part of America that is rarely seen in movies.  This movie will stay with you for a while."

The charming Moone tries to make every day an adventurous one taking us through the colourful motels, ice-cream parlours and abandoned homes. Her mother has a fierce love for Moone and tries to make ends meet. Bobby, though wary of Moone and her friends is still protective of them. He too works hard day to day and moves on.

Similarly to Tangerine, this movie is about people who live in the underbelly of our society. Gruesome realism sprinkled with dark humor and occasional sympathy.Two of the film's protagonists, a 6-year-old Mooney and her good-for-nothing single mom Halley live in a seedy motel not far from Disneyworld, Florida.Being extremely curious and mischievous, Mooney and her friends run around and create chaos for both management and occupants. Utterly unfit parents love their kids but spoil them in so many ways.\u00a0It is difficult to make a movie where kids behave naturally. Not a problem for Sean Baker.Young actress Brooklynn Prince who plays Mooney definitely deserves Oscar.I should also mention excellent casting and very impressive visuals."

While the film does boast many great qualities, such as a rather naturalistic feel in terms of several aspects, such as the performances, cinematography, etc., it can't help but feel a little too episodic and greatly lacks a straightforward story. While this worked well at times, it felt like a bit of a stretch for a nearly two hour film. Like I said before however, the film wasn't without its positive aspects, such as great and natural cinematography, as well as standout performances, with Willem Dafoe in particular giving the tour de force performance of his career. Overall, it may have felt episodic and a little too cut-and-paste for me at times, and I wasn't particularly fond of its ambiguous ending, but the film truly has a powerful heart behind it, and the acting and other minor aspects make it worth seeking out."

Ensemble cast comprised of mostly child actors is a force, with Willem Defoe at the helm, guiding you through an omniscient look at a Florida housing project and the lives of those who dwell in it.  Superb cinematography. Florida Project is an art-cinemas lovers dream.  Saturated in serene color and soaked in for better or worse authenticity."

This film takes place in a very different world, but has same gritty, guerilla feel and vibrant cast. Brooklynn Prince is the movie's central character. Her spunky personality drives the lively exploits of her small group of friends, as they pass the days inside and outside a cheap, seedy Orlando motel. Bria Vinaite is another off-the-street casting who is interesting as her messed-up mother. There is known actor: Willem Dafoe, who plays the befuddled manager, balancing his business responsibilities with his heartfelt concern for the residents. There's not really a plot, just a series of moments that mostly involve the kids running around and getting into minor trouble. Still, there's a heart and warmth to the characters and Prince is one of the most delightfully compelling new personalities in recent screen memory."

This is a \"slice of life\" movie where it's just a bunch of moments, loosely tied together, but affording the viewer pretty intimate details of a life that is totally foreign to a lot of us.  Overall I thought this movie was really well done but not exactly something I'd want to watch more than once because some of it was pretty bleak.  Know what you're watching; if you need a strong narrative arc or sympathetic characters or what have you, this might not be your kind of movie.

Another great movie by A24."

      "text": "This movie is hauntingly real, the actors too real almost, their stories hurt in a way that i s hard to forget - perhaps because we, as the viewers with probably better situations are the ones who are to able to realize what these people can't have and what these simple, sweet, children are getting twisted and torn away from their chance at happiness of childhood.It would be unfair to say that they are orphans and are dying of hunger or not being helped at all. No, they have some form of family and even friendly hands reach out from time to time, but its not enough. It's never enough to give such troubled people to get out of their vicious cycle. More importantly though, this story is about telling that there are such people and they are living, in their own way. Do not pity them, but if anything help them out with some bucks and a job if you can. Lastly, it is not where you should come looking for solutions for there is ample evidence for a lot of people it is just another way of life they can't get out or want to, for almost the same reasons as any other person from some other lifestyle - after this while, maybe it just seems easier than stepping out of the box.Special and obvious mention to the Child Actor who plays Moni and her relationship with her mother, whose portrayal as the slummy white single mother is very well done. While Willem Dafoe is too much of esoteric iconoclast to even be pointed out for his subtle acting, all the additional child actors and supporting cast really bring the whole of The Florida Project seem excruciatingly original to the viewer. The sound and general editing does well to avoid any jarring realisation between the scene changes even though there a quite few contrasts in changing.To sum up, You should watch this movie for its excellent acting, casting, story, direction and editing among all else I forgot to single out. But here's why You must watch the movie - It will remind to be kind and contemplative in your compassion on those low days when your mind can't help be a frog in the well."

The Florida Project is a kind of movie that has an amazing premise and beautiful script along with it which comes off as a magic on screen but it also is kind of a movie that if not taken care of while executing it, it may come off dull and boring. And Sean Baker is ready to take all the responsibility for it and he carries it all around on his shoulder shooting and editing some of the most precious moments on the screen (it may remind you of those little clips that were shown in American Beauty; remember the guy that used to shoot any clips who lived across Kevin Spacey). The lead child actress is amazing in it and supporting her all through the course of the movie is Willem Dafoe who easily resembles to any man in charge of the responsibilities; he is simply brilliant in it. The Florida Project carries off these little sequences building it upto something more than one can imagine and flaunts it all over the screen like a magician."

      "text": "Baker makes movies about people whose stories are not oft told and whose lives many people do not care about.  Just like with his first film Tangerine, The Florida Project (\"TFP\") tells such a story with compassion and insight, but without judgement or condemnation.  TFP delves into the lives of people who live in low cost motels because they can't afford to get permanent housing.  The story is told mostly from the perspective of a precocious, and completely unsupervised six-year old, Moonie,  who explores her world without fear.  The only recognizable actor is Willem Dafoe, who is excellent portraying the motel manager who cares for the property, enforces the rules (mostly) and protects his tenants and their children.  Though Moonie is portrayed by a young girl who has worked as an actress, her mother and her best were found by Baker on social media and in a Wal Mart with her mother, respectively.  There is a genuineness to every performance that is very compelling.  I suspect that some people will dislike this movie because it is not narrative driven; it is a slice of the lives of the characters.  Things happen, but the events seem to be less the point than the insight of how the characters in this story react, both to the events and to each other.  This is a film about week to week motel tenants, close to Disney World, living their lives and trying to get by.  If that idea appeals to you, then you'll enjoy this low budget indie film, if it does not, you should probably go see Geostorm."

Her mother is on the verge of poverty, constantly struggling just to keep up with the rent. Directed by Sean Baker and starring Brooklynn Prince, Bria Vinaite and Willem Dafoe.The harsh reality of life seen through the eyes of children. It's innocent, funny and sad all at the same time. You almost forget this is a movie, the child actors don't seem to be acting at all. Each and every interaction seems natural and believable. You're quickly brought into this story, laughing one minute and near tears the next. Although there's no clear lines between the beginning, middle and end. It moves in one smooth motion, giving you a glimpse into the life of Moonee and her friends. Without giving anything away I personally found the ending to be somewhat disappointing. The majority of the film doesn't shy away from the difficult lives these people are living so the ending seemed out of place. That aside it's heart breaking and has no problem provoking intense emotions from the audience. Truly incredible acting and one of the most immersive movies I have ever seen. You won't see a film quite like The Florida Project very often. Not to be missed and highly recommended."

      "text": "One realizes about halfway through 'The Florida Project' that the entirety film is going to continue along a rather offbeat and non-traditional track.  The film is more atmospheric than plot driven, similar in that regard to last year's breakout hit 'Moonlight.'  Both the production team and acting talent on 'The Florida Project' did a phenomenal job at world-building, creating a realistic setting filled with distinct characters that oftentimes felt like watching a documentary.  However, it's the overall structure of the movie that makes it a flat-out chore to sit through.  Stories need a beginning, middle, and end.  'The Florida Project' is all middle.  Worse, it hardly has a main character.  Or at the very least it lacks any kind of protagonist/antagonist relationship in the traditional sense.  And by the time the asynchronous ending appeared on the screen, I was screaming in my head for the end credits to finally roll, as the two hour run-time felt more like three and I just wanted to go home."

The story line is a depressing look at the desperate misspent life of a young single mother and her child daughter.  It is a case of a rebellious, lying, foul-mouthed adult-child, raising a child who is quickly becoming, rebellious, lying, and foul-mouthed. The young mother spirals more and more out of control as the movie goes nowhere.  There is no hope or redemption, just the dark picture of what life is really like for a young woman who is on the wrong side of life. She is a curse to herself, society and to her unfortunate child. Watching the movie is a complete waste of two hours of life."

      "text": "Of all of the Awards Season hopefuls going into the Oscars, this one seems to be getting snubbed the hardest. At least, that\u2019s what I\u2019d heard going in to this particular film. The Florida Project has received only one Oscar nod (for Willem Defoe\u2019s supporting role). Much to my surprise, however, I agree with it\u2019s singular nomination, however I would have liked to see it get a nod for it\u2019s cinematography, also.As an antisocial person, I feel this film unintentionally captures my general outlook on the world, so in a way, I can derive my own meaning from it. The parts I enjoy greatly feature almost no people.  The cinematography is astoundingly gorgeous, and the locations, however bleak they may be, are beautiful in their desolation. The lighting looked very natural and as a result, many of the scenes felt rather intimate, almost mirroring real life. This effect would have been accomplished perfectly, if it weren\u2019t for the main issue I had with the film: the performances.The characters, which many have claimed to be one of the defining features of the picture, almost ruined the film for me entirely. With a cast weighing heavily with children, however, The Florida Project was fighting an uphill battle to win my favour. I don\u2019t know why I seem to despise both children, and child actors, but regardless, the only performance I didn\u2019t mind in recent memory was Dafne Keen\u2019s Laura, featured within Logan. Still, having heard the rave reviews before going in, I was actually hopeful. Those whom I was with at the time seemed incredibly pleased with the performances, commenting on how good they were multiple times throughout the film. I was less than impressed. Right from the first scene, I found them grating. Not only are the performances (in my opinion!!) lacking, the characters themselves are infuriating. The children are written to be obnoxiously loud, and terribly rude. I completely understand why this is, but regardless, it doesn\u2019t make it any less painful for a viewer such as myself.Bria Vinaite is giving her first performance in a film. She was actually an instagram model, with no prior experience. Again, I completely understand why this casting decision was made, and I actually agree with it for the most part. Still, I felt her lack of experience was hard to ignore. Caleb Landry Jones (whom, might I add, has had a wonderful year in cinema: This, Three Billboards outside of Ebbing, Missouri, Get Out, and American Made) is barely in the film long enough to notice. I can remember two scenes, in which he does barely anything. The one performance which I actually enjoyed was Willem Defoe (which is rather odd to me as I can still only picture him as the Green Goblin). He plays Bobby, who is the one likeable character within the film. Naturally, he is the one character who is almost entirely pointless.I understand he\u2019s a sort of morale compass, and he seems to legitimately care for these demon-spawn children, but ultimately none of his scenes equate to anything of importance. That\u2019s a theme that runs through the film: pointlessness. Early in the film, you can tell where the plot will go. Still, it takes it\u2019s time, meandering through scene after scene, rarely impacting the next. When the emotional climax finally came, I was so detached from the characters, I felt nothing but lacklustre contentedness that the characters would be better off than when they started.Straight after watching the film, I think I would have given it a 6/10. It was visually stunning despite showing very little of interest. Having had time to reflect, however, I feel I am generous in giving it a 5/10. All I took from it was the visuals, and a single serviceable character with a great performance behind it. I completely understand why many people enjoy this film, and I\u2019m glad that it\u2019s found it\u2019s audience. Unfortunately, I am not a part of it."

The beautiful, but trashy Disney parody is presented from a little girls point of view. Every serious or traumatic event are completely overshadowed by a child; we only see it in the background. To be honest, a lot of the scenes in the film reminded me of \"Moonlight\". Little details that added to the similarities, but different in execution.I haven't seen Sean Baker's \"Tangerine \", so this is my first film from him and I gotta tell ya, it's a great start. While Baker directing isn't anything I could call a true master or anything, but the way directs certain scenes, even the ridiculous ones brings such life to the film. Mixed with the amazing cinematography is pure magic.The performances from everyone and several of the kid actors were all fantastic. A breakout role for Bria Vinaite and a impressive one from Brooklynn Prince, who carries the film. The camera is locked onto her through out. You never lose your focus, which alone is an accomplishment. This is best I've seen from Willem Dafoe. A restrain and moving performance that every time he leaves the screen, you miss him.My only issues with the film is sound editing. Some sound didn't match up or was delayed after it's action, such as fireworks. Then there's the ending which was so bad and out of place with the rest of movie, stopping it from being a perfect movie for me. The quality of being shot on a phone just looked sloppy compared to the rest of the film. It's like they didn't know how to end it.Putting complaints aside, this is still a phenomenal character study. Striking an emotional core with me. One of finest movies of 2017."

I think it's a traditional three act plot. The inciting incident is Halley losing her job, act 1 ends with the abandoned duplex's burning down, this leads to Halley's friend grounding her kid and not telling Haley why, which makes Halley turn against her, losing her friend, lifeline for cash and a place for her daughter to stay. This forces her to resort to desperate ways to earn the weekly rent. When she is finally turned in for doing an illegal activity this is the end of Act 2. Act 3 is my favorite final act of any movie I saw this year. The audience probably knows what's coming and even the other tenants can see it, but Halley can't, and that's tragic irony. I love the scene where she's cleaning out her room, and gives her weed to the cleaning lady, and the cleaning lady hugs her and tells her it's going to be ok and yet she still doesn't understand. For whatever reason the very end didn't quite pack the emotional punch I was hoping for. Maybe they needed to show the kid getting dragged away, van doors shutting on her for some finality, and then she could look out at disney world from the van window. I don't know. At any rate, still impressive. I never felt like the writing was condescending to the characters, however I think what the story was missing was a character that defied some stereotypes of the world Sean Baker is portraying. Great acting, great cinematography. I would definitely watch it again."

Someone told me he thought this would have been a really, really good short film and I think that hits the nail on the head. Sean Baker is clearly a talented director, getting terrific performances out of non-actors and planting seeds along the way that flower nicely later on in the script, but the story lacks. There\u2019s no real arch, it kind of feels like it arrived at the wrong time after the release of recent films like American Honey, Moonlight, Room, and others that have covered similar territory better. The ending also feels tacked on. Willem Dafoe\u2019s character doesn\u2019t really go anywhere either, he seems like an unnecessary addition. Still, there are some wonderful moments in the film that capture childhood very well and the setting is unique but I can\u2019t say I strongly recommend it."

Although the visuals are very interesting, showing the sleazy underbelly near Disneyworld in Orlando, and there is some good acting, particularly by Willem Dafoe, the movie was seriously flawed.  Moonie's unemployed stripper mother was hardly sympathetic.  The ending of the film was predictable, the film itself was repetitive and slow moving, and I found myself impatiently waiting for the inevitable conclusion."

While this circumscribed setting mirrors the constraints limiting the character's lives, it also limits how much the viewer can enjoy watching the movie. I wish we learned more about what other attempts the mother had made to find a job, given that her maternal instincts were strong enough to keep her from becoming drug addict despite her circumstances. It's like the filmmaker is telling us that it doesn't matter how she got into her current situation, and that something bad is going to happen to the kids, but of course it matters. Whenever you sensing bad outcomes lurking, because you know the characters are facing circumstances that commonly lead to the worst possible things happening, I think it is important to show why those things haven't happened yet to the characters.I think it is important that we take seriously the precariousness of people's lives in our wealthy (by per capita measures) country. However, I think the abrasiveness stands in the way of us fully experiencing the humanity of mother and daughter. The daughter's joyousness is infectious, but at the end of the movie her fear seems forced to me.See this movie to watch Willem DaFoe's heroic motel manager (although we never find out why despite living in this world, he manages to stay above the difficulties his tenants face and not become hardened by it) and the performances of the kids but be prepared to be frustrated by the limited amount we see of the physical environment and the lives of the characters."

Granted Willem Dafoe\u2019s performance is outstanding and the cinematography was highly creative.  The rest of the movie was abrasive to say the least. If you enjoy watching an unlikeable, emotionally damaged ( I stopped just short of saying pyschopathic) young mother raising an equally unlikeable, damaged brat daughter, then you might enjoy this movie.   The climax (anti-climax really) was predictable and should\u2019ve  come within the first 10 minutes. Instead we are subjected to a boring and really irritating non-plot for almost two hours watching bratty, hateful children and the whacked out mother day after day.  Because the reviews were so great I kept waiting for something to happen. Trust me nothing happens. You can watch this movie for a few minutes and you\u2019ve got the whole idea.  Poverty and slums juxtaposed against \u201cthe happiest place on earth\u201d - I get it."

The childhood horrors here include:- Kids in abject poverty- Orphaned kids- Absent fathers- Absent mothers- Emotionally absent mothers- Potential pedophiles- Kids with matches and empty real estate- 100% junk food diets- Casual adult nudity (minor)- Kids in proximity to adult prostitutionI became interested in the movie after haring the director on KCRW The Business podcast.  he is aware of the Hal Roach Our Gang comedies.  However he uses the candid naturalism of Our Gang in teh service of a CHILD'S GARDEN OF HORRORS.  Anyone who has worked as a K-5 school teacher will be horrified and understand kids with this kind of early bio are very challenged to overcome it after puberty strikes.  Sadly, this is high artistic talent, a colorful palette, and better-than-deserved performances in the service of HORROR STORIES ABOUT MODERN CHILDHOOD."

Although the story consists of a series of seemingly separated anecdotes, the emotional delivery by the actors and choice of setting significantly contrast the destitution of adult world and the fantasy of childhood. Despite the fact that reality often persists, fantasy is always one form of perception."

This is one of those films that take you away, here it's into the lives of many living on the outskirts of Disneyland.

Excellent directing style that refrains from moralising in a difficult situation. It's funny, it's worrying, it's depressing and tear-jerking. Cinema at its finest."

It just tells a story day after about a girl that was not ready to take care a child and struggles to keep them a home. The photography, color and acting are awesome, but I felt that the story overall was too flat. And that ending seems like they lost their super professional camera, bought the cheapest DSLR they found to record to complete the movie and download any soundtrack in a free stock website. That was really disappointing!"
