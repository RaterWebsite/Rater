      "text": "A fun, bloody spin on body-swapping comedies. It runs into some problems with the cheap gore effects and the fact that it tries to pull a Carrie 2013 and convince us that a conventionally pretty blonde white girl is an unattractive mega-loser, but a memorable Vince Vaughn performance and the way it subtly pays homage to classic slasher films (sans the blatant Friday the 13th callbacks in the opening) made it so Freaky won me over when all was said and done.One thing that's always bugged me about these kind of movies is how different the characters tend to act when they end up in another person's body. Like how in Shazam! Billy Batson only behaved like a kid when he turned into Zachary Levi, among countless other examples. This is something Freaky manages to avoid however. Vaughn portrays protagonist \"Millie Kessler\" with the exact same energy Kathryn Newton does when the big soul-switcheroo takes place, never overplaying his role as a teenage girl for laughs the way Jamie Lee Curtis did back in 2003. A move that actually makes things a whole lot funnier.I was surprised to find that on top of the humor and gleefully over-the-top murder, there's a little bit of heart here too. Nothing that will bring tears to your eyes or stick with you after the credits have rolled, but as hard as it may be to buy into Millie's schoolyard troubles as the type of girl boys don't look twice at, particularly when she's got a butt like that, her familial struggles centered around the loss of their patriarch does lead to a bit of sentimentality whenever her sister and mother are onscreen.Of course, what's really going to pull you in are the antics that unfold as our lead tries to get back into her body before she becomes stuck inside of a serial killer forever. The resulting string of hilarious and cartoonishly violent scenarios are enough of a blast to make you overlook it's handful of flaws, like how things get wrapped up so neatly and without questions or repercussions despite Millie and her pals' suspicious behavior. Freaky simply provides enough clever twists on well-worn concepts via its combination of genres to be worth engaging in the required suspension of disbelief."

Freaky steals bits and pieces from every other comedy/horror/teen romance movie, without an original thought of it's own, and not in any kind of intelligent homage way either. It's not near as clever as Scream, Happy Death Day or even Freaky Friday. This movie takes the low road with way too many F-bombs and vulgar slurs (yea, I know they're teens but it's little much) and these characters are boring, poorly acted, stereotyped teens. To top it off, the slasher and gore scenes were low budget and not very creative. On the plus side, Vince Vaughn was surprisingly adorable playing a teen girl and there are a few, very few, fun moments IMHO. April 2021"

This is a hybrid between the Freaky Friday movies (2 people exchange bodies) and the Friday the 13th serial killer series. Kathryn Newton plays the teen whose body is switched with The Butcher (Vaughn). Comic chaos ensues. While there the expected clever kills, most of the film has the teens frantically racing around to save their friend from a lifetime in the wrong body. It\u2019s high energy and although never especially clever, still lots of fun for the genre and for Vaughn."

Freaky is very similar stylistically to Happy Death Day with emphasis on quick one-liners and gory kills. It also features some pretty good performances by the cast despite having incredibly wooden characters that hit every stereotype. The writing for this movie is basic, to say the least. It is so predictable and unoriginal that it felt like there was no real attempt to try to cover up that they were borrowing so heavily from elsewhere rather than being its own original thing.For that alone, I really can't recommend it. Freaky is a predictable, cliched mess that will leave you disappointed that you wasted your time on it."

Every time he flails his arms as he runs brings a belly-laugh.And Freaky is a perfect example why they should stop making PG-13 horror movies. Christopher Landon's previous Happy Death Day movies were fun but they felt like they were missing something. I think that something was the ability to let loose.It does lose steam in the middle act with less action and unneeded character development, but you can't go wrong with this flick if you are looking for a bit of escapism."

      "text": "The body-swapping subgenre gets a fresh horror-comedy twist in this film! A young high school girl, Millie (Kathryn Newton) finds herself at the hands of a notorious serial killer (Vince Vaughn), but in an unexpected twist of fate, due to him using an ancient cursed knife to stab her, they find themselves in each other's bodies. Millie, now in the killer's body, must track down and retrieve her own body back with the help of her friends before more innocent lives are taken, and before the swap becomes permanent. Brought to us by the same director and studio that put a horror twist on the time-loop subgenre with the 'Happy Death Day' films, this film takes the premise made most famous by 'Freaky Friday' (hence this film's title), and gives it a fun and campy slasher spin. There's plenty to enjoy here too, espe the performances from both Vaughn and Newton, who both do a great job at playing themselves, but also each other, as they capture the essence of each other quite well when in each other's bodies, making for some really funny and crazy moments. The story felt surprisingly fresh despite being somewhat recycled, and the only minor issue is the slight over-reliance of past horror film homages and cliches thrown around just for the sake of winks and nods without being employed in a clever way usually. The ending also felt a little abrupt and ridiculous, but the ride along the way was well worth it and plenty of fun. Overall, it's got plenty of fun to offer, and even a surprising amount of heart to it too, and Vaughn and Newton are both hilarious, making it easier for me to enjoy and revel in this film's campiness while also being able to mostly overlook the occasional forced horror homage/reference thrown in."

      "text": "Into the heart of the film with a dagger. It is about a teenage girl that is attacked by a serial killer, unbeknownst to the two, with a ritual dagger that caused their spirits/consciousnesses to be swapped into each other\u2019s bodies. It\u2019s like if Freaky Friday met Friday the 13th, which the film made clear with the \u201cWednesday the 11th, Thursday the 12th, and Friday the 13th\u201d references and the humors of old and young swapped people flirting and carrying on their personalities in unfitting bodies.This is a dark horror comedy, with emphasis on the teenage splatter film style. It\u2019s purely set in a high schooler with teenagers as the leads with teenage problems like sex, sexuality, love interests, and anything else hormonally charged. The splatter aspect is extremely strong since all of the gore is shocking and absolutely brutal. For someone who spent a lot of time watching some of the goriest films, this one made my stomach turn a bit. I would say it dips into the splatstick genre but the gore is far too sadistic and repulsive. The comedy in the film occurs everywhere else and while the violence is absurd and unrealistic, it remains comically untouched with its ruthlessness.This exegesis has gone on long enough, but if people reading this wanted more analysis, I had thoughts of delving into the psychology of the characters and how their fates are symbolic, or the underlying theme of gender identity and attraction, or the sexual symbolism and sex-driven nature of youth. Let me know by commenting, messaging, or responding to this if you\u2019d be interested in a more in-depth critique, rather than my recapitulation. Overall, it was fun and creative, mixing the worlds of splatter and body swap comedies, possibly being the first body swap horror comedy (besides Seed of Chucky). It\u2019s spattered with annoying story logic flaws and contained to its metaphor for camp box, but that\u2019s only expected for this type of film. It\u2019s fun, refreshing, brutal, and clever so if your stomach is capable, give it a watch and enjoy the ride."

      "text": "Fans of Freaky Friday and Happy Death Day is this the movie for you. I had very low expectations but Freaky turned out to be better than I thought it would. The opening sequence looks like a rejected scene from something like Scream or Halloween but once it gets going you get this silly yet entertaining horror comedy that you\u2019ll enjoy in the moment and probably forget about once you leave the screen.Millie (Kathryn Newton) is a young high school student and has the unfortunate luck of swapping bodies with a deranged serial killer, the butcher (Vince Vaughn). Millie only has 24 hours to figure out how to switch back before the change becomes permanent. She now has the difficult task of trying to convince her friends of her identity and trying to find a way to get her body back before time runs out, all with the backdrop of teenage high school drama and the upcoming homecoming. Which as it turns out is the perfect environment for the butcher to use his new \u201cmurder Barbie\u201d disguise to go on a killing spree with an endless supply of unsuspecting victims. Right, the acting is quite bad, aside from Kathryn Newton and Vince Vaughn who are clearly having great fun filming this. The rest I\u2019m sorry, I know they\u2019re supposed to be annoying teens but it was a lot to take. The story plays out how you\u2019d expect, but at least you\u2019ll probably cringe and laugh along the way. Every scene squeezes in as many horror movie tropes and clich\u00e9s as it possibly can. You\u2019re constantly reminded of other slasher movies that came before it. From the blonde running away from the knife wielding maniac and then falling at a crucial point all the way to \u201coh let\u2019s split up and search for the murderer. What a great idea, nothing will possibly go wrong with that scenario.\u201d Yes it\u2019s cringey and predictable but it\u2019s also fun, gory and completely ridiculous.Look it\u2019s not the greatest thing you\u2019ll watch all year but right now options are limited. So if you\u2019re in the mood for a comedy horror flick where Vince Vaughn switches bodies with a high school student then Freaky will keep you entertained for the most part. Recommended for all you Freaky Friday/Happy Death Day fans."

They blended gruesome and smart kills and suspenseful moments with funny jokes and a hilarious and very weird body swap to perfectly make the movie equally funny, scary, and suspenseful. Vince Vaughn and Kathryn Newton gave outstanding performances, Vince did an amazingly hilarious job at embodying a teenage girl and Kathryn Newton was excellent at portraying a serial killer in a teenage girls body she was cool, creepy, and scary while still bringing funny dark humor. Misha Osherovich, Celeste O'Connor, and Uriah Shelton gave terrific supporting performances, they were hilarious. The special effects were superb, the kills were so realistic looking.

      "text": "**There will be some spoilers.** This was overall not a good movie. A few laughs from other actors, but Vince Vaughn made this movie watchable and somewhat enjoyable. If he were not in this then I would have walked out. There's a handful of times where the movie is getting actually good overall and they ruin it with something very cringey or demonization of straight white men. The first scene set the whole mood... almost ruined the entire film. The movie was basically a huge cliche. The amount of demonization of straight white men was obnoxious. One scene with Vince that I did not like, and actually made me very uncomfortable, was when Vince kissed this high school kid who Millie likes. I wasn't uncomfortable because two dudes \"kissed\", but rather because of the age difference and whether it was a fake kiss or not it was very creepy. They forced two scenes that could have gone differently in, quite literally, anyway just to enforce a stupid cliche and demonize straight white men. Like at the end when one of the football dudes brought Millie Kessler, who is the killer at this point, back to a quiet area with two other dudes waiting. The scene quite clearly pointed to him wanting to r*pe her with 2 other guys. And then she ended up killing all three of them. Then another scene, also at the end, when Josh Detmer, who is the gay character, went up to another football guy asking where Millie went. The football guy brought him to the bathroom and kissed Josh. When Josh pushed him off he then proceeded to call him the f-slur. Again unneeded and extremely cliche. Both these scenes, and other parts, just demonized straight white men for literally no reason. Especially these two specific scenes could have gone much differently and could have been more creatively written. This entire movie had such toxic leftist ideologies. I don't understand why movies have been going in this direction. You can make a fantastic film without demonizing an entire group of people for no reason. It's actually disappointing because this was written by Christopher Landon who did Happy Death Day 1 & 2 and those were extremely good. They didn't demonize anyone and were written very well. I'm not sure why he decided to make this movie trash."

The special effects, the jump-scares, the jokes, the costumes, the writing, and the performances were all fantastic. Speaking of performances, the Kathryn Newton (as Millie Kessler), Celeste O'Connor (as Nyla Chones), and Misha Osherovich (as Johs Detmer) trio was outstanding but Vaughn was not very convincing in his portrayal of Millie.To add to this, I loved how the movie avoided many clich\u00e9s typical of the comedy horror subgenre and even made fun of some of these clich\u00e9s. Also lovable is the more or less fair gender, racial, and sexuality representation in the movie which shows that a movie can abide by good social ethics and still be thoroughly fun and entertaining to watch. (Personally for me, any movie that includes quotes such as \"Don't underestimate a straight white man's propensity for violence... I don't care how **** old they are\" in a 'non-self-critical' way is a movie worth watching at least once.)So, I recommend this movie highly to those looking for cheap entertainment as well as those that are searching for movies with relatively fair social representations."

She's top notch here, it's just severely unfortunate the film is nowhere near her level at all.There are a few decent slasher-y moments and Vince Vaughn tries. Speaking of Vaughn, it's neat to see a different side to him as an actor but I found him to be 50/50 in this; he kills it (pardon the pun) in some parts, but in others it's clear he's trying to impersonate a teenage girl - which is the complete opposite to Newton, who plays two characters supremely well.I know I'm repeating myself, but... in layman's terms: Newton good, film bad."

It\u2019s hard to believe that Vince can play a better teenage girl than an actual teenager and that Kathryn can go from a sweet girl who is trying to find herself after losing her father to a brutal serial killer. It\u2019s amazing what these actors can do, just switching their emotions on and off.The movie takes the viewer on a thrilling chase when Millie Kessler (Vince Vaughn) wakes up in a serial killer\u2019s body after she was attacked the night prior. Now it\u2019s a race against time to try to stop The Blissfield Butcher (Kathryn Newton) before he kills more of the kids in her school, and take her body back before it\u2019s too late!This movie has some of the best acting in a body swap movie I\u2019ve ever seen. And the soundtrack (by Bear McCreary) For this movie is impressive, it immerses the viewer in the action. The only real complaint I have is that the movie isn\u2019t really that much of a horror movie, it\u2019s just a little bit gory and they call that \u201chorror\u201d while it might be ok for some people it\u2019s not for a true Horror fan, it didn\u2019t really scratch the horror itch I had going into the film, but despite its lack of Horror or what I believe to be true Horror, I would still recommend the movie to my friends and family who like suspense and a good laugh."
