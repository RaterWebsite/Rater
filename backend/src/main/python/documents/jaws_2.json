Better than the last two sequels of the ''Jaws'' franchise."

      "text": "Another sequel.... Jaws 2 is the follow on from the 1975 original masterpiece directed by Steven Spielberg which was more or less perfect which gave it it's status as one of the best films ever made and deservedly so and the acting was fairly decent and the story wasn't too bad.... JAWS 2 directed by Jeannot Szwarc in 1978 which is three years after the original Jaws film adds some of the characters from the original such as Lorraine Gary and Roy Scheider. Jaws 2 has some great moments and exciting scenes especially when the sharks electrocuted at the end and ends up like Kentucky fried chicken or in this case Kentucky fried shark!!!! Jaws 2 however has many boring moments unlike the original that always entertained the viewer and grabs their attention but Jaws 2 at times in patches is dull and uninteresting with some annoying characters. My best sequel to Jaws was Jaws: The Revenge to be honest so that's embarrassing for Jaws 2 and shows how bad it is. Mainly dull and boring."

The story has a few low points and can be a bit boring at times but the ending makes up for it."

Although the movie is a little disappointing, I still always have a fun time watching it. Not only that, Roy Scheider is in this movie so it\u2019s cool to see him play as Chief Brody once again."

      "text": "A disappointing follow-up.I enjoyed Roy Scheider's performance and the core action sequences near the end, but everything else is a bit boring. 'Jaws 2' puts high focus on the teenagers, though their story never possesses any intrigue. The effects for the shark, meanwhile, are a step down from the original.It's not terribly far from being watchable, a slightly shorter run time might've helped in that regard, but I just personally found it to be an uninteresting 115 minutes or so. Perhaps initial director John D. Hancock's ideas would've came out better, though he was fired during production; speaking of which, the issues behind the scenes for this - and even the first film, really - are pretty fascinating."

      "text": "For me, Jaws 2 was almost of same level as Jaws. The only problem this part had, was pacing. The pacing could have been better.It becomes a challenge for a director to make a sequel of a film which is considered as masterpiece and I can say that the director of this part didn't disappoint. Yes, he was not able to give another masterpiece but he gave us best sequel of Jaws.This story is almost same as first part. Overall, the film moves a little slowly in first half, but picks up dramatically in the second half. In fact, it turns out quite intense, just like the first film. The main mistake which I pointed earlier was that it was too slow for too long.One of the plus point was that the shark looks more realistic and this part showed attacks much better than the first. And ofcourse, the second half of this part was better than the second half of first part.Overall, if you want to watch Jaws franchise you can watch first two parts without any hesitation."

Roy Scheider did a great job as Chief Brody, and the teens were as great as ever.  The action sequences also looked really good, like the boat explosion and the shark getting a nasty gasoline scar.  John Williams\u2019s score was also another great score-one of the best in cinema.  This movie made me afraid to go back in the water!"
