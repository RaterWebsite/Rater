The sequel is equally as mediocre. Not terrible but definitely not good."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Fans of the first film should like it. It\u2019s more of the same odd, aimless plot and tone-deaf comedy.

While the entire premise of both movies is completely ridiculous this one does it worse than the first one.

Even the kids in the theater didn't find it funny.  It is probably one if the worst animation features created.

An extremely amusing movie."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "When I say that this movie is a godsend, I am not at all joking.  My son, Owen, was born with congenital rubella syndrome, as a result of my wife having the rubella virus, causing him to be both deaf and blind.  I am a firm anti-vaxxer, and will not be vaccinating Owen or any future kids I have, but that is besides the point.  I brought my deaf and blind son to this showing, and, I kid you not, it cured his congenital rubella syndrome.  Alec Baldwin's beautiful baritone voice broke right through his deafness, and upon hearing the voice he had to see who the godly, awe-inspiring tones were coming from.  And Lord did he see.  He looked at me and I looked at him, tearing up, and he said his first words: \"Father, I... I love you.\"  To anyone thinking about seeing this movie - please do.  It worked wonders for my family.  And to Alec Baldwin, if you somehow see this, I love you.  Thank you for saving my son from a life of darkness and depression."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "bad[ bad ]adjective, worse, worst;(Slang) bad\u00b7der, bad\u00b7dest for 36.not good in any manner or degree.bad[ bad ]adjective, worse, worst;(Slang) bad\u00b7der, bad\u00b7dest for 36.not good in any manner or degree."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "ballsballsballsballsballsballsballsballsballsballsballsballsballsballsballsballsballsballsballs"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "the best movie boss baby family business"}, {"rating": "5", "text": "BBFB was an ok movie to switch off to but not as endearing as the original movie and with a far less compelling screenplay.

The soundtrack was amazing and the reliving as a kid for both brothers in movie and the family emotion was amazingly showcased it was a fun and entertaining movie!"}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Well, what do we have as a result? The main characters actually did nothing, and, by and large, this task should have been taken over not by their father and uncle, but by their sister. The cartoon tries to say how important it is to keep the child inside yourself, to appreciate your family and blablabla. But, Tom McGrath, it's not enough to say this moral behind the scenes before the final credits. Tim was an infantile idiot, and he remained so. Ted was a careerist and remained one. The whole conflict was resolved by a sincere conversation, but in practice, these two did nothing to become better.But we have a very loud, stuffy and infuriating cartoon with sour tones. Of course, we have a cartoon that was created in order to earn money. And thank you for the fact that this time there were no children's asses and drooling close-ups. But still, this is a cartoon for children under 2 years old and parents who love all this cute nonsense. And this can be tolerated, but it becomes sad that dreamworks did it. I'll go to the shower to cry, and I'll declare the cartoon itself a big drug trip.Sorry for the bad English."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "A fun, lighthearted movie which shouldn\u2019t be taken too seriously. It is a warm movie anyone could enjoy."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "The film picks off from the prequel differently then I thought. The movie kicks in fast and your in the story from almost the start. The movie focused much more on family then actually saving BabyCorp and the world. It felt kind of weird at first but I quite enjoyed it on the second run. I feel that there is less action then in the first film which can be saw by the composition of the movie were the plot twist here is at the end where the plot twist in the first film was in my opinion when the antagonist took the special milk although I still enjoyed it despite the less action. I liked the humor and the technical stuff like voice acting, animations, etc. were all on par. There were some lore inconsistencies from the first movie but unless you were looking for them you probably wouldn't notice them. Honestly this film was a great sequel and instead of comparing it to the first movie even though I just did we should look at it as an expansion to the grand story. Speaking of grand story I am not sure if there is gonna be a sequel to this movie. I want them to make a thousand movies in this franchise but they need to make atleast an another film to end things off and judging by the ending last few ending scenes I think the team at DreamWorks has already something planned just like how they did with the first movie. This is the best cartoon/animated modern franchise and this just feels more of the first film and it also speaks a message about how much family is important. Just wanted to write this and thank you for reading.Ps. 9/10 because it's a kids movie so on some places they've cut corners, being lazy at times like using glue to climb walls but yeah still a great movie."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Mira, te soy sincero la pelicula esta buena pero al final en el minuto 1:32:45 sale la bandera lgbt por lo cual mi opinion sobre la pelicula cambia drasticamnete a un 2 pero soy bondadoso"}, {"rating": "3", "text": "The Boss Baby: Family Business is unfunny, uninspired, and undeniably stupid."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "What a masterpiece, you can truly see the bibles inspiration from this movie, so glad I saw this fantastic piece of art"}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Just by watching the trailer, I already knew the film was just a piece of trash."}], "recommendations": ["alvin_and_the_chipmunks_chipwrecked", "the_smurfs", "chicken_little", "spy_kids_all_the_time_in_the_world", "free_birds", "alvin_and_the_chipmunks", "diary_of_a_wimpy_kid_the_long_haul", "zookeeper", "ice_age_dawn_of_the_dinosaurs", "the_cat_in_the_hat", "cloudy_with_a_chance_of_meatballs", "the_croods_a_new_age", "minions", "uglydolls", "alvin_and_the_chipmunks_the_squeakquel", "home_sweet_home_alone", "alvin_and_the_chipmunks_the_road_chip", "yogi_bear", "the_spongebob_movie_sponge_out_of_water", "wonder_park", "the_game_plan", "the_lego_movie", "hotel_transylvania_2", "diary_of_a_wimpy_kid_dog_days", "night_at_the_museum_battle_of_the_smithsonian"]}
