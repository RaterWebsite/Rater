He plays a hotshot lawyer Fletcher who lets his young son down time after time, Fletcher is recently divorced as well, but can never spend quality time with young Max (Justin Cooper), but on the young boys birthday, he makes the wish of all wishes that no human could live without, the ability to lie. This naturally gives him a very bad day in court, where lying is second nature, but the better instances in the film come from the various situations that Fletcher runs into in his day of telling the truth, his above mentioned fight with a blue pen to convince himself it is red, beating himself in a bathroom for no reason whatsoever, they are some of the best laughs of the film, Carrey's unique ability to control each scene with endless amounts of laughter is truly admirable, he shows maniacal behaviour as he prances and shouts his way around a courtroom, trying his best to sabotage his own case. He beats himself up, gets in trouble with the law and continues to try and mend his relationship with his son, telling the truth all along the way.\rThe premise is interesting in the sense that it ushers towards a supernatural element, yet of doesn't necessarily promote this, what it really tries to do is test the relationship that a person holds with various important people in their lives, their boss, family, associates etc, just how much of that friendship is built on trust or more so, lies.\rThis is Carrey's film from start to finish, but Jennifer Tilly gives an appropriate amount of lustful and villainous behaviour as the temptress type mother of Fletchers struggling case in court, while Cary Elwes plays the trying to hard boyfriend of Fletchers ex-wife Audrey (Maura Tierney).\rWhile the deliberate paces creates a predictable finish, Carrey's ability to have diverse expressions and put himself out there into any role truly shows his talent onscreen, especially in such a comical capacity like he is here."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This movie was very touching.

Liar Liar is a whacky and fun movie. It may seem unoriginal, but when you put a comedic actor like Jim Carrey, it's something else.

Then again, the court scenes in the movie are about a woman committing adultery. It somehow manages to work with the movie, but is too ridiculous. (Which is what the movie is). As far as characters go, I thought they were really good, except for Jerry (Cary Elwes). He was just a bad character to throw into the movie.

This will change when his son decides to ask as a birthday wish that Dad spend at least a full day without being able to lie. A day that will change Reede's life. Or at least that was the intention of Jim Carrey in this deeply beautiful and touching film, where the laughter mingles with the beauty of the love shown by a father who truly wants to regain his family. The script, by telling a morally edifying story in an effective way, can therefore be considered as one of the strongest points of this film.Jim Carrey has achieved here one of his most important successes. With it, he became a consecrated comedian. His performance is truly colossal, there isn't a moment where he doesn't shine, completely overshadowing the rest of the cast, with the honorable exception of Justin Cooper, who gives life to the sweet and innocent son of the lawyer. Some of the scenes involving Reede and Max are worthy of humorous anthologies.Personally, I consider this film as the consecration of Jim Carrey, rather than the most famous and popular \"Bruce Allmighty\", who came a little after. The story is very simple but beautiful, the cast work was very competent, the direction of Tom Shadyac worked well... basically everything was up to the project. It's not an exceptional film, it's not a timeless work of art. It's a film for familiar entertainment, to see and to laugh.
