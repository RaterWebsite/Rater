It's was actually very entertaining, how can you not find fighters on horse back calling in air strikes from B-52s, attacking tanks, and rocket launchers kind of cool. Lots of great action scenes and a good story. Well worth the price of admission."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "If you like military historicals, then this is fine. I had two problems to note: the first is that they've got Rob Riggle (better known for comedic roles) playing the serious role of Col. Bowers. If he's trying to break into action/drama, fine, but this wasn't the film to do that, IMHO. Second, a film of 2 hrs doesn't do justice to material like this. This story should be a mini-series at least. There's a LOT going on in the month following 9/11 and squeezing into 2 hrs gives important events short shrift. Outside of those two things, the film was decent enough, full of good ole American bravado which may have been over-dramatized but whatever, it's entertaining and educational enough."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Overall a fairly good movie about the early days of the US War in Afghanistan. The action is the best part of 12 Strong, and every actor playing a member of the 595 gets a chance to shine. The first half of the movie meanders and doesn't quite know where to go, but at the halfway point, and hour in to the movie, the pieces start to fall into place. Worth a watch if you like feel-good war/action movies."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "The execution is great here. We learn about these people, their personalities, and throughout the movie, see them evolve. The action scenes are done really well. There are many battle scenes and the camerawork puts you right into the action. It's exciting and makes you really respect these soldiers. They rode on horseback against tanks and other high-end weapons, not to mention that they were often outnumbered. My only issues with this movie is that the pacing is a little uneven in areas, dialogue was hard to hear at times due to somewhat subpar sound mixing, and in general this movie doesn't stand out much from other war movies. Mind you though, these are only minor issues. 12 Strong is a mostly good war movie with good acting, fantastic action, and a story that makes you really respect these men."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "With countless movies about the tragedy that left America in shock and anger, 12 Strong follows a different story than most with the first attacking line against Osama Bin Laden. The A list cast consisting of Chris Hemsworth, Michael Shannon, And Michael Pena along with others add a good and familiar face to this gritty war drama. Everyone giving good performances across the board even the minor characters and generic soldiers shown throughout the movie as well. The overall story is clear cut and set up within the first 20 minutes and holds strongly throughout. With some Cliches scattered throughout the film that could be clouded over since it is based off of true events. Some of the scenes did feel discriminating with its depictions of americans and the towns and locations throughout. Shockingly there weren\u2019t that many action/war as shown in the trailers and promotions for the film but the biggest battle is definitely the most intense with it\u2019s feeling of threat and danger most for our cast. But the big battle did have continuity errors throughout with recycled shots of headshots, missile firing and people coming in and out of cover shooting. Overall the movie did well with it\u2019s first time director and seeing Hemsworth get back into the uniform and Pena to be himself with his comical side that gave the audience a breath of fresh air in between tense scenes. The movie did pull of tension a lot better than most war movies especially ones that have come out in the past decade possibly and it\u2019s non-complicated story made it fun and interesting to allow the story to be driven mainly by the characters after the introduction."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Horsies galloping.

That's all I ask of any film."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "This movie was a glorified american army covert operation which was dramatized due to the Hollywood effect. But despite this it was a good movie with really good acting even in the more tension full scenes and the emotional ones to. The directing style and the way the scenes where shot was decent as well. The only thing that was average was the writing of the whole movie and the character development. All 11 other soldiers where just some faces in the first half of the movie, because there was no immersion creating scene with them, or no screen time what so ever in order for the viewers to connect with the characters. The visuals though where rather good looking and pretty realistic too. There is also a life lesson hidden in there somewhere in the shallow plot of the movie, which is disguised with honor. Overall it is a good movie but barely making it as one."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Awesome performances from all the cast; Hemsworth had a great chemistry maybe with every actor in the movie, Pe\u00f1a every joke he delivered hit the mark, But it's Navid Negahban as General Dostum who is the scene stealer for me, such a good actor and a very attractive character.There are a lot of very strong moments that really surprised me, but unfortunately not all of them are edited well which shift the tone pf the movie here and there.Good and intense action set pieces and extremely beautiful cinematography.The major issue I have is the dialogue; it's very very very clich\u00e9d and corny specially when it comes to the dramatic dialogue that almost ruined the whole first act, but also after that there are many well-worn rude jokes and cheesy soldiers' talk that I couldn't bear.Also, the antagonist lacks depth; a couple of scenes to show that it's a ruthless character aren't enough to make it a compelling and strong one.(7/10)"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "A solid movie presenting historical truth in an actually entertaining manner. Extremely worth watching as the subject matter is more relevant today than it's ever been.I was pleasantly surprised by Chris Hemsworth's performance, I've never been a fan of his until seeing him in this movie, this being said, a few of the secondary characters and most extras give pretty weak performances and while I wouldn't say they had any comically bad scenes, I did feel let down by how some parts were played.If you're watching this because you want a war movie full of explosions and rambo shooting everyone then this one isn't for you, the action scenes are much more grounded than in most action movies and the pressure in them feels more genuine. You won't enjoy this movie much if you're the kind of person who pretends to be an ostrich and sticks his head in the sand pretending the real world doesn't exist, but if you're a realist you'll love this movie."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "A FASCINATING STORY SET UPON THE EVENTS OF THE FIRST MEN OF THE ARMY GREEN BERETS TO FIGHT BACK AFTER THE ATTACKS OF 9/11, WHICH WE NOW KNOW ISRAEL COMMITTED.

Chris Hemsworth plays their captain, an inexperienced soldier who not only has to lead this dangerous expedition, but has to do it on horses! Even though this little-known operation makes for a fascinating story, the production is follows pretty standard war movie tropes; There are personal insights into several soldiers, a few sweet moments with locals and insights from a Northern Alliance general. Then there's lots of battle footage, most of it noisy and dusty without much clear focus on the action or creative staging of the stunts. An adequately made film, but without much to make it special."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Pretty much the only movie where we finally get to see the aftermath of the infamous attacks done in September 2001. Actually based on a true story called Horse Soldiers, which is completely non-fictional by the way, and I hate to say that because, in my sense nowadays, I see it as a common clich\u00e9 with hardly any twists put to it, 12 Strong remains strong but eventually fails to come up with plan B just in case plan A flops which most likely here it does somewhere around the middle of the film. For history purposes, I see it as a very great film. For other purposes, however, I see it as a disappointment to keep up with moviegoers alike."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "It's clearly not the best war movie ever made, but it's such an incredible true story that you feel pumped up and inspired leaving the theater.

It dramatizes and helps Americans to understand the actual conditions under which 21st Century soldiers must operate in the brutal terrain of Afghanistan and the peculiar juxtaposition of the modern and the ancient that pervades every encounter with both combatants and innocent citizens.  It is full of f-bombs.  Apparently military people of all ranks and backgrounds routinely punctuate their sentences with mindless obscenities, even when they are nowhere near the heat of battle.  I suspect critics, who tend to be mincing metrosexuals who would struggle to pass the physical to get into the military, tend to devalue such movies because seeing \"12 Strong\" might actually evoke feelings of patriotism or pride among audience members.  The movie is well worth seeing, if only for its historical value."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "one of the best movies i have ever seen and one of the most heroic acts by the US MILITARY...."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This was a great war movie.

Based on a true story so can't fault them for the subject matter but it was presented in a way that felt quite flat and dry. I understand why Chris Hemsworth was cast in the lead role, to ride on the back of his popularity in the Marvel movies, but unfortunately, he's just not a good enough actor to be able to hold his own here. Particularly alongside some very talented cast members like Michael Shannon and Michael Pena. I'm sure he gave the role his best effort which is commendable, but I don't think he can carry off this kind of character, not currently anyway. He just wasn't believable. The VFX were pretty seamless, there are many action sequences, and I thought it was all very well done. The whole movie is set in a desert location in the middle east so get used to seeing sand and not much else. Overall, it's worth seeing to find out more about the true story behind it, but as a film, I didn't find it particularly entertaining."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Do we really need more movies about the US Military?

The scene in this movie was more merciful then what they normally would do. There was even more harsh scenes which was not included I am sure. We need  more real men like this not those who sit behind a computer to criticize and state there is too much of this macho stuff. There are not enough men like this and we need more not less.

ALL RETURN with fleshy scratches. 'Tis akin to Monty Python's 'just a scratch' Knight.Why revert to the John Wayne macho, gunslinger cult hero Capt Hemsworth to create a mythical scenario, albeit historical, which tumbles in a free fall to boring predictable outcomes and rewriting the events with a Stars n Stripes bias of \"here to set the world aright \" with the world's most powerful strategic bombing from 23 kilometres above.Ironically the climax sees Capt Marvel riding as one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse through the jaws of innumerable tanks, mobile machine gunners, rocket launchers etc to take out two Russian Rocket launches.!!It was as anticlimactic as Donald Trump' s presidency... I am asked to believe this happened. PURE HOLLYWOOD AND FAKE HISTORY @realTrump.What is this unquenchable appetite for US rewriting of clear humiliations like Vietnam and Afghanistan into mythical sideshows of unkillable heroes who prefer death before dishonour. The dialogue is over burdened with extreme patriotism and only occasionally emits a ray of light that shows the forgotten Truth \" Afghanistan is a graveyard for would be world conquerors!\". The most moving and truthful part of the movie was the wall with Russian graffiti of the 10 years of wasted lives and futility experienced in the 80's. This made the whole premise of this movie smack of the Unreality of Designated Survivor series which purports to show how Hollywood could lead America back to Greatness. This displaced world leader can only make movies about the past because it has no present glories to celebrate. My problem is that it can't tell the truth anymore so much as romanticised myths.

I hoped for a Vietnam style anti-war movie. where they admit how useless this war was from the beginning. But no.

All these American deaths were for absolutely nothing. Just like in Vietnam. After Vietnam, as many years later as we are away from the first day in Afghanistan today, America understood what a war they started back then. It pushed out Vietnam movies that were almost all great. They drove tears into peoples eyes, made them swear \"never again\". And now look at us now. Look at the propaganda movies we do, look at the media and Hollywood helping keeping these wars alive. \"Afghanistan was justified! We still need to stay there! You were all heroes! Assad is next!\".Soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq died for nothing and are still killing themselves at home. Nothing.

Other than Michael Shannon, the casting was terrible.  Hemsworth was a terrible choice, he just didn't portray a soldier to me. Pena was worse,  he certainly doesn't have the body for an elite soldier and his lines were horrendous. I did like the battle scenes with the horses, but this movie falls way short on my war movie list."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "12 Strong was a January release directed by Nicolai Fuglsig and written by Peter Craig (The Town) and Ted Tally (The Silence of the Lambs). It follows Captain Mitch Nelson (Chris Hemsworth) and his team as they embark on an operation to respond to the 9/11 attacks by taking down Taliban strongholds. 12 Strong is a mediocre film. The action is entertaining and intense, but it is largely contained in the second half of the film which is by far the stronger half. The first half moves a bit too slow and it's pretty obvious that at least 10 minutes of this film could have been cut and the first half would have felt less...bad? I guess. The entire first half is an attempt to make you care about the American soldiers, but it never succeeds and this is probably the film's biggest problem. The characters never fully develop, and I never felt super invested in any of the team's members. The stakes also never felt very high, but I will admit that accomplishing that in a film based on a true story is never easy. Like I said before, the action is the best part of this film, but it still doesn't completely save this film as a lot of the combat is too unrealistic. American special forces are good, absolutely, but they don't kill enemies with every shot they take. Chris Hemsworth's character could probably start shooting while laying on his back with his eyes closed and he'd still hit every enemy he aimed at. And while that's cool and badass, it is unrealistic to a level where it took me out of the film at times. So, yeah, the action is entertaining, but it isn't as good as some other films in this genre (like 13 Hours). I was also somewhat disappointed with the script considering who wrote it. It's not terrible, but with two accomplished writers behind it I definitely expected more. Overall, I think this is a film that may be worth seeing as a matinee if you are bored or just want to see a military movie, but otherwise I'd wait until it hits one of the streaming services."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Did this movie based on true story ,?

As action packed as it is a lot of the time you can't make heads or tails of what is happening in some of the battle sequences. Not too sure who is shooting at who, but Americans are in the mix. You could argue that only adds to the \"realism\" of what it's like to be in war, but here it just ends up messy and leaves the film makers looking a bit amateurish. There are real world counter parts to the characters in the film and I'm just not sure that the movie serves them as well as they did their country, but it's great that they declassified this mission so that we have a visual of what was at stake nearly 20 years ago.
