      "text": "\u201cLast Vegas\u201d stars Michael Douglas, Robert De Niro, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Kline in what can best be described as a senior citizen\u2019s \u201cHangover\u201d where, as in that film,  lifelong friends also experience a bachelor party in Vegas. That, however, is where the likeness ends for \u201clifelong\u201d in this film means men who have been friends for over 60 years and have gone through many of life\u2019s trials and tribulations together. This movie is geared for and will be enjoyed most by older movie goers who can identify with Cholesterol and PSA numbers versus baseball statistics and who can understand that phone calls from friends you haven\u2019t heard from in many years don' always bring happy news. Well directed by Jon Turteltaub with a screenplay by Dan Fogelman, Messrs. Douglas, De Niro, Freeman and Kline get a chance to display their comedic and dramatic talents while ably abetted by a sparkling and charming Mary Steenburgen, all while in the venue of Las Vegas and, more specifically, Binion's Hotel and the Aria Resort complex. Though the jokes may be old, they are delivered well and make for a relaxed and nice viewing experience. This is not a great film nor will it win many awards but it does give the audience an opportunity to sit back and enjoy the exploits of these senior citizens as they seek new goals, heal old wounds and cement quality relationships. I give the film a 7 and recommend it to all who believe that life doesn\u2019t necessarily end but can, in fact, begin over 70."

It does not all have to make sense or be completely believable because it is all about having fun and solving a few issues in the process of having all that fun. That being said if you also want to have a great time in Vegas just see this movie. The real life stories usually don't end with you leaving the table with 120 grand, and you don't have to wait on your plane to arrive at the airport. Movie ticket much cheaper than real Vegas every time."

There are truly hilarious moments (not just in the trailer), and a deep, relatable message about friendship and loyalty that went deeper on emotional levels than I thought it would. Also, it's funny to see these classic actors make fun of themselves like this. It's not every day you see Morgan Freeman drunk-dancing!"

Those expecting the geriatric version of \"The Hangover\" will be disappointed\u2026nothing remotely outrageous happens. Instead, there are basically 2 movies: Douglas & De Niro have a relationship drama, while Freeman & Kline provide the gentle humor. Almost all of the jokes rely on old age insults with lots of trite heartfelt hogwash to make it heartwarming. While it's fun to watch these stars poke fun at their age and there's energy in the filmmaking, this is a pretty tame comedy."

You know going in that with a story about 4 old men who were childhood friends back in Brooklyn are now in Las Vegas where one of them is marrying a girl  Lisa (Bre Blair) more than half his age what the jokes will be about and they are. There are the Viagra, prostate and genital jokes. There will be very busty women all over the place, a lot of leers and plenty of old men jokes. The men are in Las Vegas to throw a bachelor party for Billy (Michael Douglas) the Peter Pan of the group.\r Giving him the party are Archie (Morgan Freeman), who has recently had a stroke and is living with his son Ezra (Michael Ealy), his daughter-in-law Karen Ceesay and his granddaughter, along with widower recluse Paddy (Robert De Niro) and Sam (Kevin Kline) whose wife gave him a condom and Viagra pill when letting him off at the airport and telling him that what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.\r As can only happen in a Hollywood movie, Archie wins $102,000 at blackjack and the guys are given the huge luxurious penthouse suite and a host, Lonnie (Romany Malco) who is to see to all their needs. We also meet Dean (Jerry Ferrara) a mouthy kid who has to be taught a lesson, Maurice (Roger Bart) a straight cross dresser there with his wife and an assortment of female impersonator entertainers.\r Last, and most important, we meet Diane (Mary Steenburgen) who gave up her past life to become an aging lounge singer and changes the life of two of the men, probably the only 'spoiler' that can be in a film of this genre.\r The direction by Jon Turteltaub and the screenplay by Dan Fogelman. The four stars deliver with their charisma and professionalism while Las Vegas is shown at its glittery best.\r The main reason to see this movie is to catch Morgan Freeman when he shows his dance moves which are guarenteed to put a smile on your face!"

We'll never know what it would it have been like to have seen the De Niro of the Deer Hunter and Raging Bull era opposite the Douglas of his China Syndrome and Wall Street years, but at least we'll always remember that sequence in Last Vegas when a guy in a thong shakes his junk in Robert De Niro's face. That's got to count for something in cinematic history, right?"

I do feel like the film's more emotional moments do fall flat, and the romance is entirely predictable, but I had fun with it. There are plenty of laugh worthy moments and it does well playing off of it's star's ages. It might not be laugh-out-loud hilarious, but it's entertaining enough to be worth a rental and it won't feel like a waste of time. There's also a sweet core to it, although it does feel sort of artificial. Overall I give it a 6.8/10-Okay."

      "text": "When you take the plots of two successful movie franchises, and blend them into one, often the results are mixed, but this time, thanks to an all-star cast, The Hangover meets Grumpy Old Men in Last Vegas, and the results are hilarious. Billy (Michael Douglas) is 70 years old and about to marry a college student. While he seems content with his new life, he desires one last vacation with his three best friends from the old neighborhood. Reluctantly putting aside old quarrels, the men meet in Las Vegas for Billy's bachelor party, and once things get going, these guys prove that they are anything but over the hill. It's hard to go wrong with a cast of Academy Award winners that have literally hundreds of films under their belts, but a film like Last Vegas really does come down to the writing. If it's not hilarious, in the eyes of the audience, the cast will seem as over the hill as their characters. Thankfully, that wasn't the case, as simply the chemistry between these guys leads to some hilarious moments, that I'd be willing to bet were completely unscripted. Each actor brings their own unique style and brand of humor to the part and when they finally come together in Las Vegas, this film takes off. It isn't an exaggeration to say that this is one of the funniest films I've seen all year. Just the guys reaction to the things associated with modern day Las Vegas, like the technology, thugs, rap music, and strippers is absolutely priceless. The ancient cast and a PG-13 rating turned a lot of people off to this film, but the cast is a complete throw back trapped in a modern party town, leading to some epic scenes. Last Vegas is an absolute comedy gem, that somehow fell under most peoples radars, but it is every bit as good as the Hangover was, and maybe even more so, thanks to the experience of the cast and their tremendous chemistry."

      "text": "This film was one of the best times I have had at the movies recently. I'm a 19 year old student filmmaker that's been studying film, analyzing it, making it, but through all of that I forgot what going to the movies is really about; having a good entertaining time. I believe movies should do several things; have a great story: this one's story was not AMAZING but the background the characters had with each other played a huge part in the film's story. A good film should have great messages; this one had some of the best messages I have seen in recent films, something that actually made me feel so much better and just all around happy; and the film should be entertaining. The jokes were laugh out loud funny (I won class clown and my father is a stand up comedian, it's not easy to make me laugh) but the humor in this movie was great. Although older audiences might get more from it, it made me so appreciative to have my whole life ahead of me, and know that I will never be too old to have a dumb good time with my buddies. The film also captured Vegas pretty well, maybe not every aspect, but enough to the point where it made you feel like you were there. I'm sick of critics only giving good scores to these long boring movies like Gravity, or Prisoners, because it's \"more intelligent\" or whatever. Screw that, I would take this film over films like that any day, because this is what going to the movies is about; laughs, cries, heartbreaks, in this case some awkward groaning and moaning sounds (I was the only non-grey haired person in the audience) but this film did it's job. The cast was hilarious together, I'd say this is one of the funniest films of the year, one of the funniest films about Vegas (yes, funnier than the Hangover) and a film for ALL ages."

'Stand Up Guys', 'Quartet', 'Song for Marion', 'The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel' et cetera the list goes on where aged people rule. It's nice to see old guys are still capable to handle the responsibility in the entertainment business. Those movies I saw were really awesome including this movie.\r After the opening scene which lasted for a couple of minutes the next commencing portion of the story was very ordinary. Just like a copy and paste of todays movie theme based on young people who fancy LAs lifestyle. It was until the beginning of the last quarter of the movie. That is the segment I began to love it. The love triangle with strong emotions. In one word to describe, it was an ordinary opening, but ended in a style.\r It is hard to point out who had a greater role and who excelled their parts. In my view, all the four + one were equally performed good. The flaw was in the story which made no sense in many scenes regarding casino and their guest. Except those it was highly entertaining, especially the first half was fun and the rest were about heartbreaking love and friendship.\r It was kinda envious because someday I am gonna be an old and a similar kinda situation may occur to me. It might not be my story, but looks like those four are gonna be me and my friends someday. This movie might not be a reality, but stays closer to your heart in emotionally. It was not a great movie as well not rejectable."

      "text": "Commercial film making at its lazy worst starring 4 has been leads who seem to have undertaken the enterprise purely to have a paid holiday. In truth they are probably having a lot more fun than any discerning audience member ever could from this farrago.  Morgan Freeman should have known better. Robert De Niro has just become a pathetic joke in the roles that he now plays. B actor Kevin Kline has ambitions to be included in the A list of actors, but instead finds himself in an E rated film, and Michael Douglas, after his brilliant turn as Liberace, sinks to his usual underwhelming level. Pity poor Mary Steenburgen saddled with a totally unconvincing role as a singer who can just drop everything to go aimlessly wandering around with this sad quartet.\rThe lame screenplay is embarrassingly unfunny and has a centre so soft that the whole thing can best be described as mush. It also has a rehearsed feel to it and even if it was funny is played in too knowing a manner signposting jokes and situations in neon scenes in advance.. The end result comes over like an old age pensioner's wish fulfilment fantasy and the whole dismal enterprise reeks of male chauvinistic fantasy. A predictably appalling waste of money in both concept and execution."

      "text": "When an older man wants to marry a very young girl in Las Vegas, and invites his friends, all the same age as he is, things can get crazy, and they certainly do in 'Last Vegas'.\r The movie stars Michael Douglas as Billy Gherson, a successful businessman who lives in Malibu, California with his very young girlfriend, Lisa (Bre Blair) who he asks to marry her, and she says \"Yes\" without hesitating. Billy then decides that Vegas is where he wants to get married, and he calls his long time childhood friends; Sam (Kevin Kline), Archie (Morgan Freeman) and Paddy (Robert De Niro) who is angry at Billy for reasons of his own.\r When the four men arrive at Las Vegas, they start to take things into their own hands and party like they're not even old men. There are many scenes where we see young women throwing themselves at these characters, and the men seem to be having a good time... all except for Paddy.\r I admired 'Last Vegas' for its use of these characters, Douglas is good at being the leader of the group and De Niro works as the constantly fused and sometimes reluctant odd one out. Freeman and Kline do well in their more comedic roles which does keep the movie going for the most part.\r The problem is; this is almost like any other comedy of this particular setting you've seen before... it's almost as if 'The Hangover' (2009) was pushed ahead of time and this is the result of the comedy you get. Sometimes, the comedy tries too hard to make it seems limitless, and more often than not, the plot is put to a dead standstill from time to time, making you think that the movie's run time, which is only 105 minutes, can feel a little stretched out.\r This is okay for any senior to watch and have mindless fun, but for the most part, it could have had better potential."

I think the director did not have to have had so much work with the cast, with a very strong quintet, each with his Academy Awards. Perhaps most surprising is Mary Steenburgen, great on the scene, but the leading quartet does not leave to be desired, even Morgan Freeman superior sense in several moments."
