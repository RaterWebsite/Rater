Its complexity offers a fresh potential to be creative, but there is slight imbalance on the story development between the unnecessary slow-pace first half and the too-fast progression towards the end. Unexpectedly, the surprising good choice and entertaining musics, colorful visual stunning feast and delightful romance are more than sufficient to make the film to be beautiful and refreshing. This joyful and crowding story about love, family, honor and friendship delivers a strong message that learning to forgive and to be yourself, love will truly live."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Mexican folklore is brought forth in a movie perfect for families. It's got comedy, romance, and action. It's lacking in any real morals and the romance is totally predictable, but it's funny and unique enough to be worth a watch. The world is gorgeous and the characters look like marionettes come to life.\r While it may not be good enough to compete with the best Pixar and DreamWorks have to offer it's still good enough to be worth watching with the kids on a family movie night. The plot might not break new ground, but it's a memorable movie thanks to it's use of Mexican culture. One I recommend watching."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "The movie is a blast, loads of color, great music, bullfighters with a sense of humor!

Not too distant from the feel of Frozen and Tangled, but with a lovely Mexican ethos and Del Toro's customary startling mythological beasts and spectacular 3D.  Loses a bit for average music and a bit too much go girl cliche, but makes up for it with some engaging support characters. A lot of fun, and ok for kids."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Producer Guillermo del Toro and Writer/director Jorge R.

That said, the eye-popping visuals are overpowering enough to gloss over my complaints and the soundtrack and voice acting is fantastic. The way various different elements of Mexican arts and culture are interwoven into the storyline is clever and intriguing and puts a fresh spin on its all too familiar plot. A good movie overall - a shame it couldn't quite achieve the greatness a more solid story could have reached."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I didn't expected a lot from this movie, but there was something that saved the story for some reason, if you like children movies, you just have to watch it, if you don't, then you will probably not enjoy this one.\rAside from the story, the visuals reminded me a lot the game \"Puppeteer\", i loved the game...

But if there is anything we\u2019ve learned while living in the Pixar Era, it\u2019s that a film\u2019s story is equally as important as its animation.  It takes more than fancy imagery (and a famous person\u2019s name on the poster) to make a quality animated film in 2014.  Despite its gorgeous visuals and del Toro\u2019s gravitas, The Book of Life is a disappointment."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "'I don't get it' states one un memorable character towards the end of this colourful but hysterical toon. This is a sentiment with which I can wholeheartedly concur. The in cohesive story set in Mexico is unengaging as well as being full of annoying and noisy wooden (literally!) characters. Two main protagonists come over like Glenn Close and John Malkovich in 'Dangerous Liaisons' and spark the occasional flame, but generally this is an unpalatable concoction living in no man's land. Too adult for kids and too boring for adults, I find it hard to believe that it could appeal to anyone.\rThe frenetic visuals are appropriately served by a score that is also all over the place changing its tone and mood so abruptly that it becomes fragmented and only serves to underline the chaos of the whole sorry mess. Events are also interrupted from time to time by a few less than memorable songs one of which is almost certainly a shoo in for an Oscar nomination."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "It the animation was good,the music was beautiful,it was very funny,\rand it was a actually interesting story.Also the voice acting on\rpoint and it really fit the character's look and personality I really\renjoyed it and recommend you watch it ^_^"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "This fantasy travels between 3 mythical Mexican worlds on the Day of the Dead, as two men vie for the love of a woman.

The \"Book of Life\" is a story of, well, just like the title The Book of Life. However, it goes a little deeper than simply stating all things are living and have their own story. All things have \"Life\" because we provide love and everything that comes with it. The dead are still living because we, as people, hold on to their memories and love them endlessly. The only time we really go away is when we let it. The movie could get better dialogues or much fluid script but overall it is a great film to see. The soundtrack is also fantastic."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Good family film, even adults will laugh at the jokes.

Combine that with the well executed animation and on cue humor and you get a genuinely endearing little film.Its weakness lies in its inability to structure plot. The climax didn't feel to climactic because it didn't follow from most of the sequences of events following up to it. In the same way, much of the movie didn't really know how to build a cohesive series of events, as the hero's time spent in the actual land of the dead was somewhat minimal.
