Anthony Mackie does a great non-Falcon performance. The other actor is ok too. It\u2019s just they have nothing to do except read quotes from literature and stare off into the distance.I don\u2019t want to spoil anything so let me just say that you won\u2019t see IO or any real sci-fi material. You won\u2019t see the characters go anywhere or do anything in this ultra-low budget movie. More happens in an episode of the Twighlight Zone. I feel duped, hurt by Netflix for offering this movie as something worth watching. There plan is to make as much content as possible. Quantity over quality. It\u2019s too bad because the premise of this movie was workable. The characters aren\u2019t at odds with each other or the rest of humanity. There is no stupid conflict for the sake of conflict.

Finally, the glacially slow plot all takes place on Earth, there is no set on IO, there is no sci-fi really at all. It's just a sloooooow, scenic Lifetime/Oxygen women's fantasy excursion.

Around halfway through I had to start skipping ahead because I realized I wasn't going to see much of any interest happening. Just pointless conversations punctuated by another thing going badly and then another, and when the hopeful conclusion comes along they even manage to present that one in a depressing way.

Io has nothing WHATSOEVER to do with IO - it is a dull-as-dishwater post-apocalypse disaster film, everyone has had to abandon Earth for a colony around Io, but Io is never seen, the colony is never seen, the entire film is set on Earth! It might as well have been called Pluto, Alpha Centauri, Bizarro World, because it really doesn't matter where everyone has gone - you will never see what the rest of the human race is doing - the entire film is focused on the boring as hell 2 main characters.Io, and the Jovian system have fantastic potential for a sci-fi epic, which this film is unequivocably not. Besides the dull as anything plot, and the pointless, seemingly random title, the actual reason for going to Io is so pointlessly stupid it crosses the line from reasonable dramatic unscientific license into just gratuitous absurdity.I won't even bother mentioning the reason because it just doesn't even matter, just like Io itself doesn't matter, nothing that happens in this film means anything, and there is no apparent reason for any of the decisions about the plot. Anyone involved in this film should just never work on science fiction again - the writers especially should probably just choose a new career because this is just an inexcusable pile of garbage."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "I really wish Netflix would employ some decent writers for their sci-fi ventures.  This was really hacky and, even worse, belaboured.  Characters that you don't care about in a world that doesn't bear any relationship to something that matters (i.e reality)... it's pretty disappointing.  I understand why companies don't invest in new sci-fi IPs - they have high production costs and demand more of their audience than the average swill Hollywood churns out.  That said, if you invest in good sci-fi writing, you get the Alien series, the Terminator series, the Star Wars series (okay, it's space fantasy NOT sci-fi but it falls into the same funding pool), etc. etc.  I mean I LOVE the fact that this ISN'T a reboot but I HATE the fact that this isn't worth rebooting."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "\"..should confirm or disconfirm the presence of bacterium able to use ammonium as a main oxygen source.\" There's oxygen in ammonium now?

Directed by Jonathan Helpert and written by Clay Jeter, Charles Spano and Will Basanta.I like this kind of movie, a movie where there isn't action, there isn't epic events or not necessary many characters or places, but for this kind of film to work and actually be good, it would need to fill a few requirements, not all of them, but a few, these requirements, i believe, would be at least:Good Dialogues, wich isn't present here, there are so many whatever conversations in this film, somethings that don't made me think or got invested in the situation, the dialogues most of the time are just saying what you already know or things that you won't quite care, saying math formulas and stuff like that in different moments, the dialogues should make you think and absorb something, help into making you care or reflect about something, wich lead us to another thing required.Questionate something that is not usually thought by society in general and is an active thing in the same, wich this movie does try to do, it definely does, but it is so basic and badly done, they do talk about loneliness, but is so superficial, the character is alone for a long time and she doens't seem to have any different aspect from other people, she seems normal, if the movie keeps saying that people are meant to interact and there is one character that doesn't interact with anyone personally in a long time and feels normal, the script is sabotaging itself.A good narrative, this is always important to keep the audience invested in what is going on with that world, even more in a movie that doesn't happen many things, the narrative in this film it starts well, until some moment are actually things going on and they are introducing what is going on and how that affects the places to us, wich worked, the vegetation getting in the city, the purple fire indicating a polluted air, we got to know that the character is trying to find a cure or something like that, until some point it does work, but after it just stops and most of the film there isn't anything going on anymore wich completely took me off.There are some other good things, there are some pretty shots, the whole concept at the beginning is good and interesting, the acting is quite fine in some moments, Anthony Mackie did a really nice job, with frustration and hope, angry in some moments as well, Margaret Qualley is fine, in a lot of moments she is apathetic, in others she can be interesting, but not a big deal. The ending of this film is good, it made me think a bit, not about life, but still, getting together somethings from sooner in the story it can have some different possibilities of interpretation in that ending, wich is always good.The problem with this film is not that this is boring or that it have few characters and few places with an strange ending, the big flaw with this movie is that it doesn't delivers anything, it poorly try to make the audience to reflect about life or changing, but the way that they do it is so bad with such whatever dialogues, dialogues that don't go any deep, is so simple, but at the same time pretending to be something giant."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "As far as the premise of the movie goes it probably hookes all viewers, but when it comes to the actual movie it's going to turn off a lot of them. But when you look at it for what it is, it's an okay movie.So, Girl stays on Earth in hope that one day she finds a way to have bees be able to survive the toxins. She does this by living in an air pocket on top of hill. But then nature happens and one little storm kills all the bees... and well that is just about as intense the movie is going to get. The movie makes an interesting plot, but it falls flat early one by not taking advantage of the large potential for such a story. There are a few nonsensical decisions which deflate the smart decisions made before (You know which one i mean) and the character of Sam becomes less relatable as the story progresses. On a general note, I'm getting frustrated with Netflix as they put out multiple Sci-Fi movies a year now (which i like) yet seem incapable of making one that hits it out of the park. This movie smells of the same effort of movies like Titan. The ending... it's quite lazy and lacks any impact. If we were actually shown the people of the exodus missions on Jupiter's Moon it would have mattered more as we know nothing about the conditions they live in.Overall this movie was pretty average, as it entertains but falls flat on delivery and satisfaction. I give this movie a 6/10."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I.O is a bold attempt at a fascinating and complex premise, despite all the bad reviews it had I feel like this film was very badly misjudged, there were some justified arguments for being bad mainly in the Science part of the Sci-fi because this film pays no respect what so ever to science, but beath all of that and if one looks very closely, there's something there to be admired, mainly how it unfolded and acted, Margaret Qualley the actress that plays Sam delivers on a steady and constant pace which I really appreciated as her acting really captured the loneliness she was in, the plot didn't do get any favors but she worked with what she had and I think she was the glue that held this film from falling apart, having saying said that, I feel the need to say that I really liked it, and here's my reasons, first of all, I didn't see it as a big scale sci-fi that would adhere to the rules of science, this was more on the fantasy part but it wasn't bad by all means, it felt fluid, granted it was a bit bland at times but it really held its own I'd say, especially considering how limited the story is.This premise is infinitely complex, a lot of amazing writers and directors presented their work on it and the majority failed miserably, what we should take from that is the fact this wasn't trying to be epic, not even close, it was a simple, and as crazy at it sounds very enjoyable."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "While the movie looked beautiful, the acting was very wooden and Anthony Mackie's performance felt phoned in at times.

The Micah character is a failure in casting, acting, directing and even - to a certain extent - writing.On the other hand, Margaret Qualley was an excellent choice for the Sam Walden role.I found the message of the film to be powerful and interesting.  It makes me very sad that the film was ruined.****************************************So, I'm going to do something new.  Rather than just complain about casting, let's do a thought experiment in regard to what good casting of the Micah role would be.The obvious choice that almost any professional casting director would want for the role of Micah would be Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet.  But being realistic, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is much too expensive for a film like IO and his availability is close to non-existent I would imagine.So, a little googling...Colin Ford would be a very good choice for the role of Micah.  His ask would be within almost any budget and I would guess his availability is flexible.  The only problem I would see with Colin Ford is that he is somewhat distractingly good looking which is not particularly good for the role - but, would be great for box office.  I'm thinking makeup and lighting could address the physical appearance issues to tone it down a couple of notches.  Colin Ford could effectively deliver the emotive lines so much better than Anthony Dwane Mackie."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I thought this was going to be a waste of time but I found it surprisingly good.
