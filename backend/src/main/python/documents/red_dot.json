      "text": "It takes half an hour to carbure.It's clear that part was created for the audience to connect a little more with the lead characters in order to be concerned about their survival.Basic stuff.There's not much in terms of surprise, but the hunt and the race to survive has enough sustained tension, although I must admit that the closing is a bit hollow."

      "rating": "6",
      "text": "surprisingly watchable outing by the swedish. beautiful scenery and believable acting. loved the twist as people judged others by their stereotype. could not give a 7 due to the uncertain ending. in my opinion, it takes very good filmmaking to end a show well."
