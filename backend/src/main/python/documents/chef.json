Instead, I discovered a truly genuine film that is both charming and heartfelt for real with no unnecessary plot points (OK, the end is a bit rushed and tagged on). This is the best film since SINGIN IN THE RAIN to depict the pleasure and fun of hard work, friendship, and camaraderie. CHEF has a great spirit that is never forced and every performance is truly perfect. Just spot on in every way. Favreau really shows what a great director of actors he is in the direction of Emjay Anthony. This is a real kid, not a movie kid.\r CHEF will surprise you in the best way! Work hard, appreciate what you've got. A great message."

Favreau is just excellent as the everyman type of character.  Now that he's done Chef, and Sandler's done Spanglish, they should have a cook-off.  What film has the hotter Latina leading lady?  Paz Vega vs. Sophia Vergara....  (Incidentally, Sophia is great in this movie in more of a toned down, realistic performance....)"

I wasn't a Favreau fan, but I am now.  Vergara proves she doesn't need to be a Latin bombshell to make you love her, and Leguizamo and Cannavale are perfection--my only complaint is that the latter doesn't get enough screen time.  A gem."

The local color in both Austin and New Orleans was taken advantage of beautifully. I don't know exactly what kind of meat was being cooked in Austin maybe brisket but I have to have that immediately. I thought the whole Twitter thing was going to be more annoying than it turned out to be but in reality the convergence of Twitter and the food truck revolution in LA was historically important I think Favreau portrayed and represented it in fine fashion."

      "text": "Don't see this movie if you are hungry!  There are many closeups of delicious food being prepared and sometimes eaten that will head you to the nearest four star restaurant.  But this is much more than a foodie movie.  Rather it is a story of human relationships, primarily that between writer-director-actor Jon Favreau, who plays an ultra chef, and his growing relationship with his 10 year old son who is seen only occasionally because of a divorce.  Fate intervenes, father and son are together for a protracted period during a trip from Miami to California in a food truck, and excellent acting by Favreau and the boy will warm one's heart as father and son bond . The ending is a bit contrived, but leaves the audience in an upbeat mood--people applauded at the end.  One caveat.  The film is rated R because the grown-ups all seem addicted to the F word.  An occasional use would have been sufficient and allowed a PG-13 rating.  A pity but something that Hollywood does all too often under the mistaken impression that the vast majority of Americans are using the word in everyday conversation."

With some prodding from his ex, Sofia Vergara,  rich (not really clear how she got rich or what she does for a living) wife who is also the ex of Robert Downey, Jr.\r Favreau and Vergara share custody of a son, played by Emjay Anthony, without a self conscious bone in his body, who happens to be a whiz at, and with, the social media from posting videos to getting attention by tweeting and has to teach his father how thinks work.\r There is no spoiler in saying that the chef buys and remakes a food truck with the help of former co-worker, played by John Leguizamo, though another co-worker, Bobby Cannavale, stays at the restaurant taking over the chef\u2019s job. Scarlett Johansson, as the hostess of Hoffman\u2019s restaurant and a sometime lover of Favreau, with Amy Sedaris as a publicist, add some unnecessary spice to the film. (Heck when you are the star, writer and director of the film why not have Vergara and Johansson as lovers?!)\r Favreau\u2019s relationship with Anthony is believable and just on this side of being too sweet. Adding to this the father\u2019s search for who he really is also realistic.\r \u201cChef\u201d is not an award winning movie that is a must see but in this season of loud, special effects, comic book movies, it certainly is worth seeing even, as with most movies today, if it is about 10-15 minutes too long at 115 minutes.

It's not your typical Hollywood slick silliness (doesn't insult your intelligence) but, instead, a film made by smart people who care about the story and the characters.

Instead, I (along with a packed Austin movie theatre crowd), watched this funny foodie movie with a big time smile on my face throughout. I kept waiting for the other melodramatic shoe to drop which would bring down the pure spirit of fun. At the end, the audience burst into applause. What a kick!

Only I don't have to turn off my brain for this movie.\r This feel-good indie movie is a nice change for the director Jon Favreau who also wrote and stared the movie after directing a couple of blockbusters including Iron Man and Iron Man 2.\r The food in this movie are yummy. Oh my god. Don't watch this movie with an empty stomach. I wish there is something that if you pay extra money to see this movie, one of the foods shown in the movie will be given to you to eat. I would pay extra money for that perk to happen.\r The cinematography is excellent, especially the food parts. lol.\r The direction is also great. Jon Favreau seemed to really care about this movie that even small details in this movie is something he should focus on.\r Speaking of care, I liked how he cared this movie that he is also dedicated in his role as a chef. He took tips from an consultant producer to replicate a chef's dish. That is dedication right there.\r The cast seems to be a very A-list-y for an indie movie. Maybe because Jon Favreau has connections with so many big stars that they won't mind being in a production like this especially they are offered free food! The cast did a good job especially Sofia Vergara and Emjay Anthony (the kid in the movie). I can sense they had a very good time making the movie in the set.\r The script and the plot is really good and well-organized. I liked how this movie isn't just about food but it's also about a father-son relationship as well as being happy for something you love the most.\r The soundtrack in this movie fits the entire movie especially on the food parts. lol. I can't stop saying food all the time. lol.\r Don't see this movie with an empty stomach."

It's sometimes sweet, but sometimes serious. It has a nice blend of wit and humor, and features an amazing script that just feels like everyday conversation. The best part of the movie is what many directors strive for but never fully achieve: it shows how skilled professionals work, and how they feel when they do what they love (or hate for that matter). The food shown in the movie makes you lick your lips and just want to eat all the gourmet dishes Chef Casper prepares. And in some ways, the movie resembles the food he prepares: fresh, irresistible, and easily taken in. I could go on and on about what a good movie this was."

Probably the biggest joke of this movie's release is the fact that it has achieved an R rating simply because it has one too many F bombs in it.  The last time a great family movie with virtually no adult aspect to it got an R rating was the classic win-win. I think the MPAA or whoever does these ratings needs to pull its head out of his own ass and start reading movies appropriately. One final mention of John Leguizamo. He is outstanding in this film and pretty much makes every movie he's in better. Casting directors get this guy in more movies."

Almost 2 hours in length the film speeds along on its merry way through the spirited and improvisational style of its director who quickly shows us that simple uncomplicated themes well written and performed can make for more than adequate entertainment. This is a film where you simply sit back in your chair, relax and watch this feel good story turn out as predicted but with humor, pathos and culinary delights filling the screen in between.

Not world beating by any means, but it is undoubtedly endlessly enjoyable and fun for the whole family. In terms of acting, John Leguizamo has a great charismatic performance in support here and really is the bright star in this bunch. For a child actor, EmJay Anthony is also good and never really sticks out like a sore thumb. The kid was entirely convincing. Jon Favreau was fine in the lead role as well, he made you like him right away and while he may not be my first choice, it worked well overall. Scarlett Johansson and Robert Downey Jr. also had good, though small, roles here. Now, I do not know if I can buy that Favreau dates Johansson and used to be married to Sofia Vergara here, but since the guy wrote, directed, and acted in this one, I can appreciate the dream, haha."

      "text": "Chef is a film about a battle we all face to reconnect with our passions when the flame has burned out. Jon Favreau, a jack-of-all-trades in Hollywood who has hidden behind his passions for the last decade or so, has stuck to his guns on this one and delivered an indie film that not only delivers a tasty slice of one\u2019s person\u2019s struggle to keep their passion alive, but also shows the consequences when one follows their passion too closely. Carl Casper (Favreau) is a phenomenal chef but a lousy father to his son Percy (Emjay Anthony). Carl tries hard to entertain his son with artificial activities that he thinks would allow them to bond by taking him on roller coasters, to town fairs and the beach, while failing to realize that all Percy wants to do is just hang out with his dad. In an early scene, Carl and Percy connect over a homemade grilled cheese sandwich, discussing twitter, social media and the effects of the Internet on youth and an older generation of users. Percy smiles and the art of subtly is established. Chef could then best be described as the perfect grilled cheese sandwich; familiar and fattening, yet, when cooked right, its gooey, cheesy deliciousness and soft center always finds a place in your heart. Chef may be cheesy and formulaic at times, but at its core it\u2019s just plain comfort food that is perfect for the soul. Simply put, Chef is mm-mmm satisfying filmmaking in the shape of a surprisingly delicious film.\r It\u2019s not hard to see the comparison Favreau is making between his career in Hollywood and his love for independent filmmaking. There is no denying that Favreau is a modern-day pioneer when it comes to directors and writers with humble beginnings. Favreau, who started off his career scripting Swingers as well as writing/directing/producing his 2001 smash Made, has set a trend for Hollywood studios who snatch up promising young directors to spearhead big-budget blockbuster film franchises. After all, Favreau was the first director for Marvel to successfully launch the Marvel universe on the big screen and reignited good friend Robert Downey Jr.\u2019s career after his stint in rehab. Favreau is undoubtedly a man of wonders and shows off his skills here behind the burner.\r With Chef, it is not hard to see that Favreau is a lover, not a fighter; a lover of culture; of beautiful women; of fine filmmaking and most of all, a lover of good food. Through Chef, Favreau serves up his signature dish: real-world comedy that doesn\u2019t sugarcoat what real-relationships actually look like.\r Carl Casper is surely a representation of everything Favreau has been feeling for a very long time. Lost and unhappy behind the scenes of a posh Venice Californian restaurant owned by the business oriented Riva (Dustin Hoffman), Carl is given a little hint of hope when he gets wind that the critic who helped launch his career from culinary obscurity in Miami is coming back to review him. Last time Ramsey Michel (Oliver Platt) and he met, Ramsey was a small time food critic, doing it for the love of food. This time, Ramsey, backed by AOL and nearly ten million followers, challenges Carl to cook something special. As he gets his kitchen staff ready, namely his sous-chef Tony (Bobby Cannavale), his line chef Martin (John Leguizamo) and his hostess and gorgeous Sommelier Molly (Scarlett Johansson), Carl begins to prepare a menu that will knock Ramsey\u2019s socks off. Despite his best efforts, the restaurant\u2019s owner Riva thwarts Carl\u2019s plans, forcing him to prepare the same, tired menu that he\u2019s been doing for a decade. As tempers flare and egos parade, the events of Ramsey\u2019s return find Carl without a job, forcing him to seek refuge in his ex-wife Inez (Sofia Vergara) and her eccentric ex-boyfriend Marvin (Robert Downey Jr.). On a surprise trip back to Miami, Carl allows the spice and sizzle of the Latin culture to take hold, and while enjoying a simple Cubano sandwich [basically a ham and cheese sandwich], Carl finds inspiration in owning a food truck.\r It\u2019s no surprise that Favreau, who has made excellent relations with A-list actors during his time in the big leagues, likes to surround himself with the best. Chef may not look like your typical independent film feature courtesy of the generic polished coating and a star-studded cast that would make the night sky jealous, but the film uses its high-profile cast to its advantage. From Dustin Hoffman, who plays a the perfect, grumpy restaurateur, to Scarlett Johansson, who captivates with subtle sounds during a seductively sexy food foreplay scene, to the mega superstar Robert Downey Jr., who in only mere minutes, finds a way to convince audiences that he is able to create a more outrageous character than Tony Stark, the film showcases the organic talent of a cast who have spent a little too much time in the bright Hollywood spotlight."

I'd go as far to say this is a new genre of movie. Food and Cinema, eat something nice whilst watching the movie, you're gonna get hungry."

      "text": "I was positevely impressed by Chef: I originally thought it was going to be worthless, by looking at the trailer - that same trailer that lets you think Scarlett Johansson and Downey Jr. are actually acting in this movie. Rather, and especially for the latter, I think their appearance should be counted as just a cameo.\r Chef, helped by Latin music and food imagery, is a handsome comedy without too many pretences and one good script - not good because it's epic or intelligent, good because the dialogues sound natural, for once. Good performances by the supporting cast, in my opinion, but I'm not too fond of the kid and the model.\r Good fun watch. Nothing to wrap your brain around, but still."
