The first one was good but when Smithsonian came out, I was bummed because it sucked. The Secret Of The Tomb is the WORST of the two, its boring, mind numbing but atleast Ben Stiller and Dan Stevens with ROBIN Wiliiams (His Last Role, R.I.P) were what made me atleast 30 percent interested. Its not even funny anymore, some snappy lines aside this film is the same garbage (washed out Smithsonian). Do not waste your time, because its not the same! The secret of the tomb deserves my 1/10 because at least some actors brought their best. Ignore."

      "text": "Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb is a fun family film finale to the adventure trilogy of Larry Daley. What started as a semi-educational spectacle became a trilogy that focused less on the premise and more on the CGI action. The dragging narrative picks up as beloved characters bring their antics to the big screen one last time.\r The lack of an inventive storyline and the subplot revolving around the neanderthal Laa really detracted from the anticipated climactic finish to this franchise. The jokes with that character just seemed so forced and unintelligent in comparison to some of the humour throughout the rest of the franchise.\r In the end this film is a delightfully enjoyable finale to a franchise focused on giving families a reason to go to the theatre together. If you\u2019re a fan of the previous two Museum films, then Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb will be a pleasant end to the story of Larry Daley, but some average film-goers may not enjoy the uninventive Night at the CGI Museum."

It's harmless and very creative of what the creators can do with the famous figures of are history. But the second movie I thought was a big mess. I remembered not laughing that much while watching the film, and is it just me or the movie was like it was pleading for me to laugh at it but I was left in silence for the all film. So yeah I didn't like the second movie but I liked the first and with the third one I can say.... It's better than the second movie, I can say that at least, but I'm going to be honest here, this isn't a good movie, it isn't bad, it's just not that good.\r Ben Stiller once again returns to his character \"Larry Daley\" and this time his character isn't the same character where he will wave his finger out at people and say \"Don't do that I'm telling you\", or \"Hey get away from from that\", yeah that kind of character, but in this he changed a little well since this is the last film and probably the writers of the film thought to themselves \"Yeah he needs to stop being a boss pot and lighten up a little\", and I respect that and Ben Stiller did do good in this.\r All the other cast members all do good even Mickey Rooney and Dick Van Dyke had a scene in this and it was pretty good scene. The movie looks really good has well like the all movie has that Christmas with that light blue color to it.\r Now let's talk about the ending to this movie and this isn't a big spoiler because you know this is the last movie and all the character's have to say their goodbye's and the scene with Robin Williams and Ben Stiller wrap up moment almost had me in tears. It was like Robin Williams himself was saying goodbye not just to Ben Stiller but to us, yes you the people. I know this isn't fully his last movie because there's another movie that his in called Absolutely Anything and that comes on this year where he plays a talking dog and Simon Pegg is in it as well, so that's really his last role, but the goodbye scene in this was pretty sad and Robin did really good in this movie, like he always do.\r Now for the things that didn't really work in my eyes like: The cave man in the movie that's suppose to be the comic relief got on my nervous and if you just take him out of the film the all movie wouldn't feel like it's missing something. The writing in this isn't all that great, yeah it's a kids and family film so yeah I can see why they have to dumb it down, but come on the one liners in this fell so flat to me.\r Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb is not a bad film, it's not flawless and the movie isn't trying to be. If somebody ever said to me would I recommend this film to family and kids and I will say yes go a head they would enjoy it... I hope, but it's not for me."

A star studded cast do what they can with a very weak script but they really are fighting a losing battle. A particular low point is the running gag with Stiller's neanderthal doppleganger, which surely someone saw was stunningly unfunny. The highlight comes with a big star cameo near the end. A shame that this may be seen as Robin Williams last film"

Because when the first movie came I thought it was a nice idea and then its sequel was so bad without any further innovative ideas to add up. I was not expecting the third movie, but it made its way and I give it a try only to get disappointed.\r Ben Stiller is a fine actor and a great director, this trilogy was just a passing cloud in his career, other I would have blamed him for accepting the offer. As we know its a multi star movie, in that I am very happy to see Robin Williams one final time. What a great actor, lucky we had him in our time. The funny thing is I am confused for Rebel Wilson as Melissa McCarthy, but soon after realised.\r The rest of the cast, Wilson, Coogan, Kingsley and other were what to say, their existence were in individual narrow thin lane in a weak story. Badly needed a fresh plot in the well known concept from the last two movies, and it did not give us. Hope the reboot would be very creative in the each three. May be it should set in the Hollywood studios like Marvel, Disney et cetera. Because, as I am a movie fanatic, love to see some of my favourite characters like Gandalf the gray, Joker et cetera, as well as beasts like Godzilla, King Kong et cetera come alive at night. It would be so awesome. Anyway, this movie was just okay for a certain reason. Don't expect high, because it won't serve you.\r 5/10"

It intends to be ridiculous, joyful and hilarious, especially the monkey character, Dexter which impresses the most are all the main factors that the film is suitable for family goers on Christmas. The film would be a complete disaster without Ben Stiller to lead, but this does not save the film to look dull, not so funny with lame jokes, weak scores and to look inert. Overall, it is a disappointment as this family franchise film lacks of inspiring message, burns off the original film's energy and ideas, and ends losing all the magics abruptly."

At times the interactions between characters looked awkward, you could see they were going through the motions. Like it was less the movie, more the paycheck. Robin Williams was not at his best and he seems so sad throughout which in retrospect might have been the case. The new characters, the cheeky security girl, the Knight, were ok. The lions from Trafalgar square chasing a laser light was the highlight. It was enjoyable, just I was expecting more. So many historical characters to choose from, a fresher pair of directorial eyes might have helped."

I wouldn't be surprised if they get a nomination for set decoration, maybe costumes. The scenery and location shots were superb. The story was the weakest part of the movie for most people, but not for us. It was silly, sappy and sentimental. Just what we want to escape to instead of reading the latest horrors in the world. It's about people who have no common interests, no common culture to relate to, and are centuries apart in age and ideals. Yet they mostly get along and care about each other. If only that was real life. It was bittersweet seeing Robin Williams and Mickey Rooney (died at 93 after a 91 year career in show business). The Movie has a wonderful goodbye scene for Robin as Teddy Roosevelt. The good feelings from the movie made us leave happy with the magical theme of people of all kinds getting along, which of course, is fantasy in real life."

While I love Robin Williams as much as the next guy, I feel his passing has seriously clouded most people's judgement on this movie as a whole. Everyone want Robin Williams' last movie to be remembered well.\r Well, nuts to that. I will remember him and his great performance, not the movie.\r The effects are about on par with the last two movies and the plot (while a clich\u00e9) is better than it was in the first two movies. A weird Hugh Jackman cameo though, funny how he poked fun at himself.\r Overall:\rNight at the Museum 3 is better than the first two movies in terms of humor and writing. BUT, it laughably rehashes almost everything from the fist movie,AGAIN! Even though it is in a whole new country. It also mostly forgets the events of the second movie. All in all the movie on the whole seems to be trying too hard to do what it did right in the last two movies. In that respect, it succeeds. Only problem is that we've seen it all before (except for NeanderStiller, that was stupid.)\r While Williams' performance was great and heartwarming, it was also mostly needless. He was there simply as a promotional tool, when a British historical figure could have fulfilled the same purpose. So sad when it was common knowledge he hated being a sales gimmick. Think about it, if he hadn't been in this movie, would it have done as well? I would hope so, but sadly star power sells."

Some great cameos this time around add to the laughs.\r It might not be anything other than more of the same, but I found it to be enjoyable nonetheless. It's a welcomed sense of deja vu.

The acting, of course, was incredible.The scene where Akmenrah met his parents almost, ALMOST, made me tear up. You could read his emotion on his face - his love for his family, even after having not seen them for years. Robin Williams' final lines were more than a bit touching. The SFX were great, too (the constellation scene had me spellbound), but could have been better. The ending, on the other hand, left a bit to be desired. They had it set up well enough, with Akmenrah choosing to stay in London with his family and the tablet, while the others left back for New York, but I was expecting more of a relationship between Larry and Tilly. I was hoping that Larry would teach Tilly about the magic that was now her job every night; I was hoping he would help her learn how to handle the live dinosaurs and tigers and mammoths and war criminals; I was hoping he would at least warn her about what was going on - the two are kindred spirits now, after all. But no, instead the only thing he tells her is that she'll have the \"best job ever.\" Then it jumps to three years later, which disappointed me because I was eager to see how Tilly would handle her new-found responsibility and how Larry fared after the loss of his night show and if Nick ever went to college or not. This wasn't the only part that left me frustrated either. There were scenes when I felt the camera was focusing on entirely the wrong thing. During the roof scene, I wanted to shout at the screen \"Who cares about the monkey when Akmenrah is crumbling to dust after just having reunited with his family for the first time in decades?!?\" Although, in all fairness, this is a children's movie, and children would rather focus on the monkey. There were also some scenes I felt were a little unnecessary, such as the romance between Teddy and Sacagawea that was thrown in there at the last minute just for good measure (come to think of it, did Sacagawea even do anything in this movie? It seems she was just off to the side the whole time. I wasn't paying attention to it while I was watching, but I don't think this movie even passed the Bechdel Test). The same goes for the monkey-kiss scene in the falling action. Just because the main character didn't have a female love interest doesn't mean you can substitute in a monkey. Even though I had my quarrels with the falling action, the resolution ended on a positive note. The magic wasn't gone. It will never be gone. It just moved somewhere else to allow for new adventures and misadventures. With that said, I feel I should emphasize that this film is for children and families, and some of its shortcomings may be excused because of this. Despite its flaws, I actually enjoyed the movie while I was watching it, and if I didn't appreciate these movies enough as a kid, I certainly do now."

It was a boring movie only one funny part in it as well. If they do make a number 4 I hope it's better otherwise I will just stop watching the franchise. :("

      "text": "Definitely the weakest of trilogy but still fun. I loved going to London and seeing all the new exhibits come to life. sir Lancelot was a treat to watch and was probably one of the best character. we also get a fantastically developed back story to the tablet. This movie takes alot of inspiration for the first. For example back is the party scene at the end we get more of robin Williams as teddy Roosevelt more rexy once again because teddy Roosevelt travels with him to London. The action once again is fun and Hugh jack man makes a hilarious cameo. dick van dyke comes back after being absent in the first movie for a short but worth while scene which adds some back story to the tablet. Speaking of which when there were flashbacks to the tablet the ancient Egypt scene were effective and although they were extras no white washing. Micky roony dick van dyke and bill cobs come back briefly but it was good to see them again. Ricky Jarvais as always does great as Larry daily's sassy boss. What keeps this movie from being great are a couple of things. While not completely gone gone is mostly the smart humor Ben stiller seems more grumpy than in the previous too which i didn't like. Russel Wilson as the night guard lady was OK but not the best. Also any scene with laa was not done very well. I understand he was the comic relief but he was not very good but i see it was defiantly a character geared more toward kids. The father son relationship sub plot was completely under developed and didn't add much to the movie. However even with these flaw the movie still maintained the joy the others brought in a fantastic last performance from Robin Williams and mickey roony keeps this movie as one of the weakest yet still enjoyable and a surprisingly satisfying ending to the trilogy films"
