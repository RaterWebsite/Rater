The way they fall in love reminded me quite a bit of 'Naley' from one tree hill and yet it had this whole sentimental feeling to it. It's not the kind of film where the most important thing is to make some good shots with the camera, and I think that's what makes it so memorable. It's completely worth watching and, even though it's a bit too sentimental for me, I suggest everyone who has a chance to not listen to the Cinemato...what ever their called reviewers and watch it - but remember to have a tissue in your hand."

Get straith on top of my film collection and is a daily inspiration in my life. It would have deserved some better judgement from cinematografic critics. This is a true masterpiece for those who can understand its deep meaning (far beyond the simple love story)."

Starting from the film, now the film A Walk to Remember players reunite and have a romance in real life.  In this film there is no element of expressing love by having sex only a kiss and for me that is normal for western culture.  This film also provides a lesson that not always someone's bad past will be bad in the end, some people can change for the better when he has found the right person.  This film is worth watching for teenagers and I highly recommend it to you guys........."

Full of character archetypes, shameless manipulation, trite dialogue, and contrived drama, A Walk to Remember is unmistakably the work of a hack; a hack thinks this is the only way to write a compelling romance. Excuse me, but I like romances where I feel for the couple because I like them as people, not because they're religious and contrived illnesses separate them. That's how you can tell when a movie does not care for its own integrity, and simply chooses to manipulate. There are no characters in this mass, only archetypes and contrivances."

Sappy love scenes where Mandy retains the same facial expression, a wedding, a death, a bad choice, lesson on faith.. Should I go on and on? The two dudes in the movie that fall out as friends show a bit of acting snuff, but the girls are simply terrible. I'm sorry, but a teen with leukemia isn't gonna be dancing around in school plays and singing up a storm. I am a Christian, so I admire the message this movie attempts to convey, but it just isn't enough. I think my favorite part of the movie was the opening 5 minutes. The rest has no plot, jumbled character archetypes, and one cheesy cheesy cheesy moment after the next. Really, is this what the intelligence level of our teen girls has fallen to?"

The script writer left out almost everything from the book which I for one, was very shocked about. There were so many beautiful scenes in this book and the way Nicholas Sparks writes is like a work of art. In the book, Jamie is portrayed has the girl who always helps the needy. She is always volunteering at the orphanage. I thought it was very strange how they left  such a significant detail out of the movie. My all time favorite part of the book was when Landon went to collect the money jars for the orphans for Jamie. I can honestly go on and on about how poorly this movie was directed. But than again, the books are always better than the movies."

He knew the role and tended to its requirements. He had me bought, hooked, and breaking it off with the Significant Other, and that was before he pleaded with his cardiologist father to cure a cancerous Jamie. I mean honestly, who doesn't want; crave to be loved by Shane's Landon? A lover's movie. Parents, Siblings, Friends, Fresh and Jaded lovers. In written form it drips candy, but allow yourself and you too will empty the kleenex boxes. In short, Everyone wants to be Jamie, but we're all afraid to admit it. Terrified of breaking step with the norm. Perhaps we wait until death knocks on our door."

      "text": "I love the writing of Nicholas Sparks, I find it very heartfelt and honest. When it comes to the book A Walk to Remember, it was good with a heartfelt ending and characters and the story did touch me, but some of dialogue was occasionally lazy and repetitive for my liking.The movie is a decent one. It does try to stick to the spirit of the book even if one or two of the details aren't as coherent, and it mostly succeeds. The pace can be a little too mannered though, and although most of it is genuinely touching there are other times throughout the movie when the story and subject matter tries a little too hard to evoke emotion. There is the length too, I personally felt it could have been shorter.However, A Walk to Remember is beautifully filmed, with beautiful locations and striking photography. The soundtrack is poignant and beguiling, the script tries hard to excise some of the more lazy and repetitive dialogue of the book and while some of it is still a little too repetitive for my taste it is also very honest and heartfelt. The story was enough to warm and break my heart, and the ending touched me hugely. The direction is eager as are the performances. Shane West is very charming and Mandy Moore is convincing, but Peter Coyote and Daryl Hannah are the ones who really impress.Overall, while it does try too hard sometimes A Walk to Remember is a decent movie. For other movies based on Sparks' work, I recommend The Notebook and Message in a Bottle over this both of which genuinely resonated with me, but as a film A Walk to Remember is much better than the forced and predictable The Last Song. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
