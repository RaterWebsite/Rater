Tiene una l\u00ednea argumental que hace un gui\u00f1o respetuoso y simp\u00e1tico a la franquicia The Purge sin caer en una vil copia de esto y aquello. Para finalizar, no pod\u00eda faltar el gore, que si bien va de menos a m\u00e1s, no llega a ser excesivo, est\u00e1 en su medida justa y necesaria.En lo personal la disfrut\u00e9 much\u00edsimo, la mezcla de comedia, thriller y suspenso me fascinaron por completo.

First thought in my head it wouldn't work because there alot of horror movie that are bad when it based on a game like truth or dare. Overall this movie works and its self aware. Grace our main character is a common horror character type but ends up as a strong lead. She run away from danger but starts to fight back knowing she got a 50/50 chance of leaving. The family of Andy steal the movie completely. Everyone brings something comedic to the film. Not all jokes land and a tiny bit of bad writing. Still I loved this movie. Its better then Crawl which is a normal B horror film. Loved it too, I seen every horror film this year except for midsummer. But if you love a fun horror film I highly recommend watching. If you have AMC A-LIST definitely watch it. Right now this is my favorite horror film of the year."

      "text": "\"Stand tall and **** them.\".( 43/100 ).Grace (Samara Weaving) y Alex Le Domas (Mark O'Brien) disfrutan de su boda con un ambiente tenso que hace sentir a Grace muy inc\u00f3moda y, de alguna forma, desapegada, mal recibida y pr\u00e1cticamente odiada por la familia de su esposo. La soluci\u00f3n a ello se presenta m\u00e1s tarde en esa noche cuando la familia la invita a jugar un juego de mesa que podr\u00eda poner en peligro la vida de Grace. Dirigida por Matt Bettinelli-Olpin y Tyler Gillett, directores de \"Devils Due\" (2014) y participantes en colecciones de terror como \"V/H/S\" (2012) y \"Southbound\" (2015), pel\u00edculas que probablemente disfrutar\u00e1n mucho si les agrad\u00f3 \"Ready Or Not\". Pero por mi parte desafortunadamente tendr\u00e9 que hacer un ejercicio de desprecio. Lo \u00fanico decente en la pel\u00edcula es el elenco y probablemente el maquillaje. El grupo de actores tiene un acuerdo decente y cierta uni\u00f3n que se refleja en el \u00e9xito c\u00f3mico del film. Las actuaciones son exc\u00e9ntricas y exuberantes, sin miedo a romper alg\u00fan l\u00edmite que pueda imponer el gui\u00f3n. Por su parte, la pel\u00edcula cae en un g\u00e9nero gore y el trabajo de maquillaje y vestuario logra crear situaciones muy sangrientas, grotescas y repulsivas, sin embargo, no es excelente o lo mejor del a\u00f1o y los elementos restantes solamente disminuyen su calidad. El concepto o la idea pudo haber sido explorado de formas interesantes, pero los guionistas parecen haber optado por sustituir cualquier potencial intriga por una gran carga de morbo lidiadas por personajes idioticos bajo una justificaci\u00f3n absurda. La pel\u00edcula simplemente no tiene ni pies ni cabeza, no hay una introducci\u00f3n o contexto, el desarrollo revela secretos que nunca se aclaran, la catarsis de Grace, aunque razonable, es meramente impulsiva y arruina la resoluci\u00f3n final que, por m\u00e1s l\u00f3gica y prevista, se siente fuera de contexto ante la estampida de consumistas ilusos e incompetentes que toman compromisos que no saben cumplir.-Grace (Samara Weaving) and Alex Le Domas (Mark O'Brien) are on their wedding day with a tense ambient that makes Grace feel very uncomfortable, unattached, poorly welcome and practically hated by her husband\u2019s family. The solution is presented later that night when the family invites her to play a board game that could threaten Grace's life. Directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, directors of \"Devi's Due\" (2014) and participants in horror collections as \"V/H/S\" (2012) and \"Southbound\" (2015), movies that you would probably like if you liked \"Ready Or Not\". Unfortunately, from my point of view, I'll have to write with contempt. The only decent thing in the movie is the cast and probably the make-up work. The cast has a decent acting agreement and some unity that is reflected in the comic success of the film. The cast is eccentric and ebullient, fearless to break any limit that the script could impose. On its way, the movie falls in a gore genus and the make-up and dressing work manage to create very bloody, grotesque and repulsive situations, nevertheless, it's not excellent or the best of the year and every other element just diminish the quality of the movie. The concept or idea could've been explored in more interesting ways, but the screenwriters seem to choose to replace any potential intrigue with a big load of morbidity led by idiotic characters under an absurd justification. The movie simply doesn't make sense. There's no introduction or context, the development reveals secrets that are never cleared, Grace's catharsis, if reasonable, it's merely impulsive and it ruins the final resolution that even if it's logical and predictable, it feels out of place in front of a stampede of naive and incompetent consumerists that make commitments that they doesn't know how to fulfill."

It is the first contact I have with the duo of directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, and what I saw was very pleasant and fun.The characters are a mixture of people with strange archetypes with a deepening of a very discreet personality. Kristian Bruun's characters, Melanie Scrofano, Henry Czerny, Nicky Guadagni and John Ralston don't go beyond the line of character archetypes for a big depth. They are very shallow in what they propose, sometimes funny when it suits and convenient when the script needs it. They didn't captivate me and therefore aren't widely remembered for their deeds. The characters of Mark O'Brien, Adam Brody and Andie MacDowell are the ones that stand out for having well-established backgrounds and distinct personalities. They create their disagreements between the three because of their personalities and purpose that move them the during the plot.The highlight of acting goes to Samara Weaving who builds a smart, courageous, brave character and full of intermediary between these characteristics. We see a growing trajectory in his personality. If at the beginning of the film we saw that she already had these adjectives, throughout the film they potentialize themselves by becoming something incredible and coherent. Unfortunately your character is not so lucky even though your choices are the smartest for a horror movie. This character is wonderful.The story is very interesting with its rules and the crazy things that the script delivers to us. In my short stay on Earth, I didn't see many films in those aspects, so I can't be sure that the script for the film is original. The costume reminds me a little of the old times and I found the green and yellow colors interesting.Ready or Not is an entertaining film, it's interesting, containing a protagonist different from many others of the genre and that captivates those who watch it."

      "text": "In this horror comedy, Grace (Samara Weaving), a bride, on her wedding night, unexpectedly finds herself in a ritualistic deadly game of hide-and-seek orchestrated by her rich in-laws. I found this to be a very well-put together movie.The backbone of the film is the dysfunctional Le Domas family. Each member is distinctive and well acted, and they have varying levels of competence and willingness. The ritual isn't a regular occurrence for them, and they act like regular people more than most horror movies featuring groups of killers. Half the fun is seeing the Le Domases try to figure what to do next as much as the heroine. Speaking of her, Grace is a fine lead. Admittedly, her character doesn't differentiate herself much from other movie heroines, but Weaving is good in the role. You do root for her as things get progressively worse.The actual backstory of why the ritual is taking place is thought-out and interesting.The movie blends the humor and the horror. Though the violent moments occur sporadically, they are pretty strong when they happen. I was kept tense by what was happening to Grace and what'll happen next.The design, sets, and costumes all look great. They have a classic haunted house or murder mystery feel to them.Be forewarned that although the film is generally amusing, I didn't have any laugh-out-loud moments. It's more about the general feel.Overall, I found this to be a pretty fun time and recommend it."

A friend of mine said he thought it had the same feel of \"You're Next,\" and I agreed going in. But it's not nearly as good as that horror masterpiece.

The movie is confused with what it wants to be: social commentary, horror movie, suspense thriller or comedy. Unfortunately it doesn't tick any of those boxes and ends up as it's own punchline. At best, it's a B-horror movie that should have gone straight to DVD. The jokes are dry, the plot development is painfully obvious, the script reads as if it has been written by a badly trained bot and the characters lack any depth which makes it even harder to take seriously. Some of the actors did their best with the available material but unfortunately there wasn't much to work with. The concept is actually interesting but the execution is severely lacking.

The trailer gives you all you need to know.  The trailer is probably the extent of the actual movie running time that's not filled with dark, grotesque, graphic, gratuitous violence.  The characters are completely unlikable, with the sole exception of the heroine, and by the end of the film, you're even rooting for her to die...to put yourself out of the misery that is this waste of celluloid without having to make the \"walk of shame\" and leave the movie early, like one of the other 2 people watching this movie tonight did (within the first 15 minutes.

Apparently a good portion of it if the creators of \"Ready Or Not\" are to be believed, as the actual finished product tries to jazz things up with drawn out exposition, convoluted backstories, and Satanism. Nothing typifies how badly this movie gets caught up in the \"how\" and \"why\" better than the conclusion, which somehow ends up being the most violent and least interesting moment in the film.

It's massively entertaining, thrilling, and hilarious and reignites my faith in horror comedies. Very-well executed and rarely boring. Give it a watch for a Friday night stress-busting session. TN."

      "text": "First of all, I wish this film was a bit longer. The film is one hour and thirty-five minutes, with credits, and I feel like if it was longer it would have helped it out a bit more. This is a slight spoiler but it\u2019s the opening scene so either skip over this or read it but the film just jumps straight into the film. There is no lead up into it, it just jumps right in so not till later in the film do we learn why they are doing this. So, I feel like a couple of extra minutes in this film could have helped it out. The acting starts out cheesy and kind of annoying but as the film goes on and the stakes get higher it takes a sharp turn and becomes pretty good. As the movie progresses you get to see which family members are fully invested into this and which ones would rather not do it. I will say that Grace is one of the most badass characters in horror and I was always cheering her on. I will say the editing in the film is kind of award at times and makes no sense. I say sometimes because most of the time it\u2019s edited just fine but in a couple of scenes it just jumps to a scene that isn\u2019t connected and almost feels like the directors were like, \u201cShoot we forgot that one scene well let\u2019s just throw it in between these two scenes even though it doesn\u2019t make any sense to.\u201d This film is a horror-comedy and I will say they balance the two well and a couple of scenes had me chuckling. The last thing I want to mention is the score by Brian Tyler is great. In the end, I highly recommend checking out this film at least once because it\u2019s a unique and original story and we don\u2019t have a lot of that now a day. I give Ready or Not a 8/10."
