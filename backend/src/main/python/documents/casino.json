Scorcese has Robert de Niro subtle, meticulous, and ruthless, Joe Pesci is every inch the tough-guy gangster who never backs down, but has a temper that is rather too immature and loose. Sam Rothstein (de Niro's character) is efficient and serves his bosses well - he's always sending the goodies back home! Sharon Stone's Ginger is a wreck, drug-induced, unstable, irrational, and apparently, very stupid. Now, how did she lure Rothstein's cool cat personality to fall for her? That's everyday life for you - the smart, cool ones do fall for those types - beautiful, with a personality and body to match, until the gold sheens off the statuette day by day. Pesci's fight scenes are brutal, but real. There is no pretence in these scenes - there is enough violence in the world to disguise such brutal depictions on celluloid. I enjoyed the desert scene, when Rothstein captures the essence in his narration as Pesci's character races through the desert - you didn't know what you could get from Pesci's character. Casino is just a magnificently handled subject, Scorcese has not gone over the top or over-done it, it's impeccably handled, the actors are just apt in their parts, and it is just fascinating to see how the gulf spreads between de Niro and Pesci's characters. Thumps up for Casino - if I may dare say it, it surpasses Goodfellas in its power and impact, and ultimately overpowers Scorcese's later movie, The Departed. Yes it does, I'm betting on it....with Sam Rothstein's back-from-the-dead character on the line!"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "What a milestone. Perfect movie with top characters with outstanding acting, especially Joe Pesci, Sharon Stone and Robert DeNiro. The story is tense with interesting details about the casinos in Las Vegas.

That says a lot, isnt it?"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "An excellent drama.  The acting and story is at its peak.  The most charismatic version of Robert De Niro."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Casino is an amalgamation of many directing styles from Martin Scorsese. The narration in the movie by Deniro & Pesci fits the movie. The crime scenes are great and every second of the movie holds your attention. There are many twists throughout the movie & unexpected comedy as well. Casino is one of Marty's best movies."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "The costume budget for the film was $1 million. Robert De Niro had seventy different costumes throughout the film, Sharon Stone had forty. Both were allowed to keep their costumes afterwards."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I did not know, when I went to see this film, that there was a true story behind it. But that was something that struck me because of the way the film presents the plot. It became evident that there was something and that was a bonus, a film that, in itself, is already capable of proving itself excellent. Despite all the comparisons with \"Goodfellas\", (I couldn't help doing them myself), I don't think Scorcese tried to repeat the dose, although it is undeniable that he likes to make this kind of films, involving mafia or organized crime (\"The Irishman\", very recently, and \"The Wolf of Wall Street\", for example, not to mention the obvious \"Goodfellas\").The script shows how two Chicago mobsters manage to control and run a casino in Las Vegas until marital problems, betrayal and mistrust, addictions, greed and brutality eventually led them to their fall. There are some sub-plots that are developing equally, but everything is brilliantly orchestrated and combined by Scorcese. The film has all his style and their three hours length pass quickly. The heavy atmosphere, the brutal and raw violence, the current use of slang and f-words, are all part of a style that Scorcese associated with his gangster films. The torture scene where that guy's head was smashed into a vise is worthy of anthology, and likewise some of the scenes where Pesci gets angry and starts brutally beating those in front.Robert De Niro is one of those actors who never, or almost never, fails. And he works beautifully with Scorcese, as does Pesci. The three collaborated wonderfully here, and the result is a harmonious combination between the work of the director and the two main actors. There is not a moment out of tone. Pesci's performance was really the best of his career, much more mature and profound than in Goodfellas. Sharon Stone, in turn, had to face a difficult character, in which beauty is associated with a certain spirit of survival and a vicious cycle, that ends up leading her character to self-destruction. She has a character that requires beauty, sensuality, but also a lot of psychological depth, and the actress achieved its combination brilliantly, being nominated for the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress that year and winning the Golden Globe in the same category. She, like Pesci, achieves in this film one of her best performances ever (or at least everything I have seen of her so far). In addition to them, the film has good additions such as James Woods, Don Rickles, Kevin Pollak, Pasquale Cajano and Vinny Vella, among others.Technically, the film is impeccable. Filmed inside a real casino during daily closing hours, you couldn't demand a better or more detailed set. The cinematography and camera work were also meticulously done, and editing, mixing and post-production work are impeccable. The pace is good, with scenes so well linked that the whole story is crystal clear to the audience, despite the three hours length. Finally, a word for the soundtrack, which harmonizes perfectly with what the film shows, and the general environment.This film is not just a follower in the path of \"Goodfellas\", although there are similarities in style, derived from the presence of the same director and main actors. It is a different film, less sympathetic perhaps, more brutal, realistic, intense, sometimes cynical and deeply critical. It is definitely worth seeing."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Casino is an underrated gem in the crime genre; it's Metascore of 73 simply doesn't do it justice. However, it's still one of the best crime films that I've seen. At the center of this movie is the rise and fall of Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein, a gambling expert and mafia associate who lives the good life as a casino operator in Las Vegas - at least before the decline of his career and his personal life. The film tells a compelling story containing themes of power, greed, deception, and betrayal. Scorsese's direction is brilliant as always. The performances are stellar as well. De Niro \"aces\" his role as Rothstein, as does Joe Pesci as Nicky Santoro. The highlight is Sharon Stone as Ginger, the wife of Rothstein who seems pleasant at first - only for you to discover that she's rotten at the core. Casino is a brilliant film which definitely deserves to be mentioned among the best films in the crime genre."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I love this one as much as Goodfellas. What else to say?"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I don't consider Casino Scorsese's very best film(Goodfellas is my personal favourite), but it is a fantastic film and definitely one to see. It is shocking, disturbing and unflinching in places, particularly the part where a head gets squeezed in a vice, but that added to the atmosphere rather than distracted from it.Casino is brilliantly made too. I loved the setting, the cinematography and editing are outstanding and never take away from the atmosphere, and Martin Scorsese's direction is superb. The realism the film has is always absorbing, the subplots that form the story are intriguing and the characters are adeptly drawn.The story for me has seldom a dull moment, not with the subplots as intriguing as they are, how well made it is, how good the characters and acting are. The characters also are deliberately less endearing than are seen with Goodfellas, making it perhaps a more even portrayal of unorganised crime, but the decision to do that paid off. The acting is equally impressive. Robert DeNiro the great actor he is is incredibly charismatic, Joe Pesci gives his best performance in one of his more meatier roles and Sharon Stone(who has never been this good or even sexy before) is a revelation in a very demanding role.Overall, hugely compelling and underrated. 10/10 Bethany Cox"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "One of the best movies of 1995, but alas, sadly, it wasn\u2019t even up for best picture the year it came out and I really don\u2019t understand why. This is probably Scorsese\u2019s most overlooked film. Casino is a great movie and so underrated by a lot of people. Should really have a higher score than it has right now from critics. This is one of the best movies I\u2019ve seen in my life, I\u2019d put it right under Goodfellas and slightly above the Departed. It\u2019s under appreciated and this is a movie that doesn\u2019t get talked about enough. If you are easily offended by violence and swearing, then this film or any of Scorsese\u2019s movies for that matter, might not be for you. But if you\u2019re a big, diehard Scorcese fan or just into gangster movies or cinema in general, I consider this one a must watch. Make your own opinions on the film and go ahead and rate it. Overall, I give this movie a very high 9/10. Amazing soundtrack and great acting make this an excellent movie watching experience. Sharon Stone, Joe Pesci, and Robert De Niro really nailed it.In my opinion, almost as great as Goodfellas, like right up there. If you\u2019re a little bit squeamish, well, you should still enjoy it. That\u2019s all I have to say."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "A great movie that manages to be quite the original when it comes to gangsta types. It doesn`t come off as nearly repetitive as \"The Godfellas\", even though we`ve seen Presci and De Niro in many such films. This is in a huge part achieved by major role by Sharon Stone, who exceeds all expectations. There is nothing simple about her character. She never comes off as simply bad or good. Sometimes you understand her fears, sometimes you condemn her. Nevertheless, she made her own plot in this movie. From others we see the same excellent actor work, though I liked the Rothstein`s character a lot more than in other such productions. This is because he never stopped being human. At some point he even enjoys the gangster life completely, although he always chooses the more in between solutions. Joe Pesci did the rest by creating an excellent villain, though sometimes also a bit confused. The music, the camera work also excellent. Almost 3 hours of sheer virtuosity."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "On of the best gangster films ever made.

The story is just so good and you will be hard pressed to ever find a better pair of performances than the ones by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. I love this film, I loved it the first time I saw it, and I loved it the hundredth time I saw it. Casino follows a pair of gangsters who earned their reputations in Las Vegas in two very different ways. De Niro is Ace Rothstein, the man with the plan. He always made money, but since he was Jewish, he was never fully trusted. Pesci is of course, Nicky Santoro, the tough guy who says  seven thousand times, while doing things his own way. Everything about this movie is pure genius.

Robert de Niro gives what I consider to be his finest performance since Taxi Driver, absolutely nailing the role and outshining his co-stars. Joe Pesci also does well, and as usual he and de Niro have great on-screen chemistry. Despite being three hours long, every scene feels natural and necessary, with no real filler.

The length is not unnecessary - all of it is used to develop the story and characters with excellent narration and acting. You see a film like Scarface and it's mostly just a montage - a brilliant one, but nevertheless too much jumping around. However, Casino manages to get the story across in a very believable way. The personal issues are so deeply explored, and the fact that Robert De Niro is a \"good guy\" really adds an extra perspective. In every other film, everyone ends up being a baddy and gets whacked or goes to jail. But in this one, it was interesting to see the story from two perspectives - De Niro's and Pesci's. The two actors suited their characters' roles perfectly, and the pacing was inline with how quickly one can imagine events developed. The rise, the top and the fall all got their relative share of the action according to how long they last. Best of all, the movie was not about doing crime for the sake of it - it was actually mostly about business and not killing people randomly with a few deals being used as a cover-up. The direction and general style of story and development etc. are almost identical to Goodfellas, so if you enjoyed that this is definitely worth watching as well."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Like many of Martin Scorsese's films, Casino is non-formulaic.

And I think they both starred in Once Upon a Time in America and I've heard that it's a really long film. With Robert De Niro's last collaboration between Martin Scorsese, this film is based on true events of what happened in Las Vegas, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci played Sam Rothstein, aka \"Ace\" and Nicholas Santoro, aka \"Nicky\", They're both childhood friends in real-life. It's kind of an interesting story about those two friends are getting alot of heat on Las Vegas of who's going to run the Casino. I really like this movie even though it is very similar to GoodFellas with Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci narrating but what can I say, there's nothing wrong with that and this is a phenomenal film with great performances and story and it has some good tunes in it.

And he has found himself actors who are able to convey his message effectively. Casino deals with this subject in the business of gambling.\r Sam Rothstein (Robert De Niro) is doing good running a casino for the Mafia in 1970s Las Vegas. Things get tricky as first Ginger (Sharon Stone) and then Nicky (Joe Pesci) come into his life. They're both unstable and careless, and have no vision for their futures like Sam has. Their antics get him into trouble time and again.\r Like Scorsese's other movies, the plot takes a backstage to the characters and their personal quirky moments. He instead relies on multiple voice-overs to propel the plot forward. The plot does thicken with time, and not for good. It felt like he wasn't sure if he should concentrate on the characters or the plot development. Goodfellas found that balance ingeniously, so did his later movie The Wolf of Wall Street, both of which deal with the same themes.\r The acting was sufficient, I suppose. De Niro does a decent enough job. Pesci's character is too similar to the one he played in Goodfellas. In essence, he is a character actor. Sharon Stone also did a good job.\r I couldn't feel excited during a single scene in the entire movie. There was no sense of danger and urgency, despite the breakneck pacing. The film was just a scene after scene of greed, violence and narration. It got old after a while.\r The production design, which brought the 1970s to life, did a wonderful job. The same camera angles were used as were in Goodfellas. The camera zooms in on people's faces the same way.\r I found the movie a bit underwhelming. I felt like Scorsese wasn't done with the subject that he started out to tell in Goodfellas, and hence returned to it.

Sure the argument has a basis. Pesci pretty much repeats his short-tempered mobster from Goodfellas. Both films have similar eclectic rock backgrounds (including heavy usage of Rolling Stones songs). Plus the f-bomb is dropped pretty frequently. Yet Casino still has some positive points to help it stand on its own. From the great writing to the beautiful cinematography, Casino isn't a slapped-together and hastily-made effort. It is a great film with a great story that starts off on a documentary-esque note but slowly reveals itself as the gritty crime drama Scorsese fans fervently crave. The cast is great too. Pesci (who really is the only one who can play short-tempered gangsters like Nicky Santoro) and Stone (surprisingly) shine in their roles. But it is De Niro that deserves the cake as Ace Rothstein as he gives an exceptional performance showing emotion while smoothly restricting it with inner power.Of course, there are some scenes in Casino that feel overdone with language and/or violence to the point where the scene looks comedic. Plus there are scenes that kind of allude to Goodfellas (especially the Pesci beatdown scene) since actors from the former film are reused in Casino.

The characters were well crafted and their arcs very interesting to follow. There were a lot of them, sure, but it was never too overwhelming. In addition, the true story aspect of this made the story really work and I can see why Scorsese was drawn to this, as it feels like a very Scorsese film, as thematically it is similar to many of his other works.

Casino brille donc de mille feux comme une Rolex mais a l'air souvent d'une tocante merde in China qui voudrait juste avoir l'air...Malgr\u00e9 ses d\u00e9fauts, Casino n'est certainement pas d\u00e9plaisant \u00e0 voir et \u00e0 suivre (en d\u00e9pit de son m\u00e9trage qui d\u00e9borde) et les com\u00e9diens nous font encore de sacr\u00e9s num\u00e9ros !"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This is a good movie however my only issue with this movie is that it was too damn long...close to 3 hours in a slow paced cinematic driven story telling."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Martin Scorsese's Casino is a great film, expected from a director of Scorsese's stature. Casino opens with short sequence in 1983 before moving on to the meat of the story, which is related through flashbacks. Director Martin Scorsese makes heavy use of voiceovers, employing disembodied monologues by both lead actors -- Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci -- to fill in gaps. The sheer volume of words sporadically detracts from character development, but it is integrated successfully enough not to seem overly intrusive. In every way -- from the fantastic sets, rich dialogue, and unapologetic violence to the well-portrayed characters and themes of loyalty and betrayal -- Casino is pure Scorsese. Although not the director's top work, this is nevertheless compelling film making. Casino sparkles like its fake diamond of a host city. The cinematography, which uses surprisingly few tricks other than freeze-framing to emphasize key moments, is crisp and clean.(Top tier film from a top tier filmmaker)."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Casino is one of them long films that drags but it's better than Goodfellas, Goodfellas is horrible and never been a fan and not because of the violence but so much of it is actually boring and Lorraine Bracco is appalling and a horrible and uninteresting actress because if anything she brought nothing to Goodfellas except constant annoyance and this dulled the great performances from other people in the movie which was disappointing plus all that family nonsense made the film very boring... CASINO is much glamorous than Goodfellas in colour quality terms and, the area and the surroundings and the performances much better.. Martin Scorsese made Casino in 1995 and Joe Pesci, Robert De Niro, Sharon Stone and James Woods star.... Great performances and acting especially by Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and James Woods and some of Casino is mildly amusing thanks to Joe Pesci's over the top and constant bad language approach.  Sharon Stone is a bit annoying but otherwise a good film however Pesci for me steals the show!! Contains bad language, violence, possible nudity and sex scenes"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Nice movie with a Special View on the gambling world and expecially the DARK Sides!!

The story is brilliant but not nearly as brilliant as the performances. Deniro does a fine job as always but Sharon Stone and Joe Pesci are just as good.
