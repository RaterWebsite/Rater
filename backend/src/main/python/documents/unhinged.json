Playing a man who has lost it after the loss of his job and marriage, The Man kills his ex and her partner before burning down their home and vanishing into the night.Rachel (Caren Pistorius) is a woman who is seeing her world slowly crumble around her. She is in the midst of a contentious divorce, has just lost her best client, and is struggling to take care of her son while dealing with her brother in financing moving in with her so she can afford to pay for a needed care home for a family member.As one thing after another mounts for Rachel and dealing with heavy traffic as she tries to get her son to school to avoid a detention for being tardy; she honks and makes and aggressive turn in front of the Man. He takes offense to this and drives alongside Rachel and demands a since apology for her actions. Rachel has long since lost any sense of caring and does not provide a sufficient response which further triggers the Man.As some very aggressive road rage follows; Rachel believes she has put it behind her and drops her son off at his school. While filling up her gas tank Rachel sees that the Man is following her and when her efforts to diffuse the situation further trigger the Man she sees just how dangerous and highly unstable individual he is.What follows is a deadly game of cat and mouse as the Man taunts Rachel while exacting his revenge on those in her life all the while preparing for his next encounter with her.Crowe is fantastic and gives a very intense performance without ever going too far over the top and becoming campy with his performance which is often the case in films of this type. He is a compelling adversary who commands the attention of the viewer and one can see that he is an individual who has simply snapped from the pressures and reality of life and believes his actions are justified.While I was able to predict one of the big moments near the end of the film; it was delivered In a slightly different way which was refreshing. The film was intense and compelling and Director Derrick Borte keeps things from become too over the top especially in the last part of the film where Hollywood standards for the genre did tend to come in the play.The film wisely relies on the strength of Crowe and the supporting performances and provides a welcome return to cinematic features for viewers as long as they are willing to overlook some minor things and focus on the intense story and compelling performances."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "oh no oh no, a fat gladiator is chasing me in his carriage, the best thing to do is to ride through half the city and get no help"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "He can happen to you is the tag line, and it\u2019s true.

This film is overly violent and way too light on character or story. There's not a single scare in this entire movie. It's just sadism and cruelty for no reason. A rushed, tacked on ending caps off this unintelligent venture into cliches."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Road rage is taken its most violent route in this downright gripping thriller. A woman (Caren Pistorius) is having a bad day, which is made worse (much worse) when she has an altercation with a very upset and yes, unhinged driver (Russell Crowe). What could have been avoided with a simple apology turns into a non-stop series of malicious encounters, including several spectacular car crashes. To make a movie like this effective, you need a good villain and Crowe brings all of his talent to create this extremely bad guy. Director Derrick Borte has staged every scene with assured power and continual tension. This is one of those sure-fire audience pleasers that would have the viewers screaming at the screen (if only we could have crowds)."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "I'll make this short. The premise is simple. A man had road rage against a woman and her son. The acting is good. Russell Crowe sells a maniac. He steals the show. The action was a lot better scripted than I expected. The cinematography was done splendidly with certain angles for the chases. Realistic in some aspects for sure. Final thing is that after watching this movie you will think twice about being a jerk to your fellow driver. Solid thriller."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Unhinged was a movie that somehow released in theatres in these covid times. The premise is \"that a mother who leans on her horn at the wrong time, to the wrong guy. \"Road rage\" doesn't begin to describe what he's about to do to her and everyone she knows\". It's a very silly premise but feels very 2020-like. My interest in this movie was mostly the fact that I got to see Russell Crowe as a villain which is not something you get to see often. However, was the movie a sweet ride or did it make me \"Unhinged\".Firstly, Russell Crowe in this movie is fun to watch. He plays Tom Cooper who is a mentally unstable individual who causes chaos for our protagonist Rachel Flynn (Caren Pistorius). There isn't much depth to his character or anything and for the most part, Russell Crowe just gives an exaggerated angry performance but it's still very entertaining. Caren does a relatively good job as the Rachel and Gabriel Bateman likewise as her son Kyle. They give good performances and do a good job in conveying the fear of this \"road rage\" of Tom. Apart from that, the movie is just extremely silly. You have to REALLY shut your brain to enjoy this movie. Our main character makes some choices that feel really dumb and questionable. You also wonder why she wouldn't do certain things that would be more obvious to do. Likewise, the cops in this movie are absolutely terrible which doesn't feel believable whatsoever. They somehow struggle to catch a killer whos car and face are visible while knowing his objective of terrorising Rachel. They don't hack the phone this killer is contacting her from or have someone protect her and her son. They don't ever maintain contact with her or go on a huge manhunt for this killer is ridiculous. This movie wouldn't have lasted 90 minutes if the cops in this movie were remotely capable. The movie has a lot of questionable logic so if you start questioning everything then the movie becomes very difficult to enjoy.The action scenes are not impressive or anything either. Most of the car chase is just generic looking car chases. I actually laugh during some of these car chases because it can come off as really silly. There is a scene where Tom repeated rams into Rachel's car from behind and it just looks visually quite funny. Also during this scene, none of the other drivers reacts whatsoever. Something I also found funny in this movie is that it seems none of the other civilian drivers knows what a \"brake\" is because they always end up being the one to cause massive damage. During the third act, it becomes a very silly fist fight and it feels very 90's especially since Rachel gives a cheesy one-liner. During the fight, both Rachel and Tom are somehow to able to stealth without making a sound which is such a cliche from old action movies. The movie also ends in a cheesy way with a very silly message of \"don't road rage cause they might kill your family\". Overall, the movie is dumb. There isn't really anything impressive about the movie and I really wonder why they thought it was a good idea to put in theatre around the \"Tenet\" release date. Nothing really makes sense in this movie and its, not like the cinematography or the score is good. However, there is some fun to have in this movie because it borderline is \"so bad it's good\". Seeing Russell Crowe play a crazy guy in a short 90-minute movie is not the worst thing you can be watching."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "It\u2019s always good to see Russell Crowe channel his inner demons and deliver a brutish character and Unhinged does just that. As man at the end of his rope Crowe is certainly a formidable presence but really that\u2019s all this B-movie schlock has going for it. It begins well and the basic premise keeps you watching but it soon succumbs to every formulaic device at its disposal and quickly becomes tiresome and preposterous. As good as Crowe is, this material is very much beneath him."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Unhinged \u2013 Un-Everything Any logical viewer could not be blamed for thinking we\u2019ve had enough of this so-called \u2018entertainment\u2019 \u2013 there\u2019s no intelligence on display here, it\u2019s all over-the-top carnage.  As road rage goes, this ugliness is equal to a war zone of ultra-nasty smash-ups and brutality. All this from a moviemaker simply looking for new ways to horrifically kill off as many humans - as can be fitted into 93mins of appalling writing. Russel Crow must have entered his golden years to even think of allowing himself to be cast as this grotesque loser (or is it simply uncaring greed)No one emerges from this mess with any credibility except maybe young Gabriel Bateman. He hopefully may soon be given some sort of significant character to play, in something more worthy of his youthful talent.  Basically, this type of movie demonstrates the manifest irresponsibility of movie production and distribution, being inflicted on the sick and sorry world of today.

In conjunction with some really satisfying vehicular-based set pieces, it's the snarling, electric performance from Russell Crowe that you really came here to see.

Enter manic Russell Crowe and his roaring pickup truck. Rachel quickly becomes his target and spends the rest of this crime fuelled thriller trying to escape a severely unhinged man. Buckle up for a movie that\u2019s not quite Duel and not quite Falling Down but somewhere in between. Keeps its foot on the pedal from the get-go and doesn\u2019t let up till the credits roll. Stressful to say the least, but it does the job. It\u2019s not the most original or memorable film you\u2019ll ever see and honestly without Crowe Unhinged probably wouldn\u2019t be on anyone\u2019s radar. Yet he makes a great villain with a very menacing onscreen presence. It\u2019s tense, entertaining, and may cause some paranoia the next time you get in your car.Unhinged is the fun and immersive cinematic experience we need right now and after 157 days without seeing a single movie in the cinema I can tell you nothing felt better than losing myself in the big screen and forgetting all the other madness for 90 minutes.

Ok so some plot elements don't entirely work or make complete sense but its a tense and engrossing watch, once the pace speedens up within the first 20 minutes or so. I was also surprised by how Russell Crowe looked in the film - has he been bulking up or was he wearing a fat suit? I don't know and the accent was perhaps mildly cringey but in any case, he plays a pretty sinister character. Its a reasonably short film at just under an hour and a half long but I felt quite gripped to the screen and there are some decent special effects present. Its maybe not the most amazing or original of films but if your looking for a fast paced/high octane thriller you can switch off and enjoy, this is a good bet.

Little did we know our minds were about to be blown, but not in a good way. The plot just straight-up died around minute 10, and the movie quickly deteriorated into a fever dream. As Murphy's Law dictates: \"Everything that can go wrong, will go wrong.\" Nosedive #1:The plot took its first serious hit, when the antagonist proceeded to smash Andy into a pulp in front of a packed restaurant, while nobody seemed to care a murder was happening in front of them. Nosedive #2:We were on the \"peak cringe\" as we discovered that the master plan to defeating the driver was a goddamn FORTNITE strategy that was mentioned early on by Kyle. It is especially cringy, when you consider that the writers \"foreshadowed\" the takedown during a telephone call between Kyle and his father. Nosedive #3:How in the world does an actor like Russell Crowe come even a mile close to this movie? It becomes clear that Crowe is in some serious financial trouble, no self-respecting actor would ever agree to participate in such a load of Bullcrap. This has got to be the lowest point in Crowe's acting career, let alone any actor's career.Nosedive #4:The script is too whack to comprehend. Not once does the police even give a **** about a mother and son being chased by a crazy lunatic. The excuses were so far-fetched that you'd be more successful finding a hot single in your area than coming up with those. \"We were busy\", bruh, they're the police force and they couldn't dispatch EVEN ONE car to help them. Jesus christ, this just speaks of how lazy the writers were. At times, the dialogue feels like an out of season April fools joke. We could name all the instances where the movie dialogue shriveled up and died, but we'd be able to write a 40-page paper. The plot feels like a script bought off of fiverr for 10 bucks. The movie continues to commit cardinal sins every 2 minutes, but going into detail would bore you to death. The script reads like your local methhead's hallucenogenic diary. The dialogue feels like a slap to your face and an insult to your intelligence. All in all, this movie is 90 minutes too long and should never have seen the light of day. It should've been incinerated straight away and it still blows me away that anybody said \"Hell yea, let's make this\". To enjoy this movie, you'll have to be on serious drugs and/or alcohol. On a more positive note, the average viewer of this movie will experience the 8th wonder of Humanity, namely its destructive tendency to make absolute garbage when given millions of dollars of budget.It is truly amazing that there are people in this world, who pretend to see a deeper meaning behind this plot, especially when the last scene reduces the message of the movie to \"Honking bad\". The movie is destroying itself by the minute and we're all grateful that \"the trash bin can be emptied\", with a clear conscience."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "I hate movies far apart from any logic or expected behavior.
