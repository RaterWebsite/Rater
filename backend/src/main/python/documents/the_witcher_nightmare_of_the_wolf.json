It won't change anything if you replace the witchers with Alucard and his gang.There's nothing of the witcher in this story, but that's half the problem. There is no LOGIC in this story. Spoilers. A test in the swamp, when the witchers throw the recruits to certain death. Indigenous Afro-Kadwen people. Full-fledged magic is used by witchers instead of the signs aard and igni. At the same time, there is no hint of Quen, Irden and Axii. The sorceress, paired with a mutant elf, directs the monsters to storm Kaer-Morhen, the peasants storm the same Kaer-Morhen side by side with the monsters. What does all this mean? Lambert is the same age as Eskel and Geralt. Witchers who breed monsters so that they have someone to kill. The fact that after a long time, when Vesemir has time to grow old, the monsters will still not be destroyed, although no witchers will breed them anymore, does not bother anyone.Not a hint of the Conjugation of the Spheres, as if it did not exist. That story with the priest, because of which everything started spinning, is also a brain drain. Vesemir bribed the cook to poison the priest, so that the priest thought that he had been defiled, and hired a witcher to kill the sorceress... The damn plan is simple. Reliable as a Swiss watch, if I understood everything correctly."

But I can even see that they are trying to cash in on the castlevania series. With the over the top fighting, and with a weak story I found myself wanting to turn it off half way threw. even in vesemirs flashbacks, talks about swindling people from their money, but then hes shocked that they create monsters to continue there life style??????? If anything vesemir would most likely be ok with it. Here you have a man who's driven by coin and then all of sudden he grows a heart. I mean what did he think was gonna happen if all the monsters were killed? it would have made more sense to have had the witch be the one truly making the monsters, and pin it on the witchers. in the end i did enjoy some of the story, the animation was good, and monsters were interesting. But not good enough to get a second look over."

      "text": "this was extremely disappointing to watch maybe because i held such high expectations for it.it's unbelievable how lore-unfriendly the whole portrayal of the world is, it added nothing of value to the witcher world, this movie felt more like a castlevania ripoff than an authentic take on the witcher lore. Lauren schmidt hissrich you could've just told us it was fanfiction from the beginning lol, black kaedweni aristocrats and gay witchers? give me a break please. i don't take this show seriously as an extension to the witcher, i was just watching for the flashy fight scenes and animation really.the storytelling was shallowly rushed, maybe 90 mins weren't enough for the events to unfold in a proper pacing or maybe it's just terrible writing.as for the characters, they were underwhelming at best. no interaction was that memorable. it felt like the script writers were so self-conscious about their work that some dialogues were too perfectly eloquent to be real. to say it in short, no character felt relatable even papa vesemir and this is coming from a die hard witcher fan. i wasn't attached to anyone and really didn't care about their fates, i was just waiting for the story to end. not to mention the irrational arguments and actions that were made by that sorceress, probably the worst character in the show.and to finish the last bit of the rant on the thing that bothered me the most, and that is the voice acting. the voice acting my dear sirs and madams was pure trash. like seriously what's the point of a human recording his/her voice to represent a fictional character other than displaying emotions or to react in a proper human way to a certain event to bring the character to life? my man vesemir and the others were just reading the script for us. deglan's voice-actor was better than all but the same goes for him.now besides these things i enjoyed the animation and the last fight scene, the final 25 minutes were entertaining and included some interesting moments, but they couldn't compensate the total mess that took place before.the concept had potential to be better but the execution was bad. extremely bad to me personally at least.oh and the honey cake looked delicious."

This movie is lazy, every corner that could be cut has been, the characters are easy and generic, the time jumps are hard to place, the main love interest has an american accent despite growing up around everyone with english accents.

And yet at first time, I was afraid that Vesemir would be completely different character, worries were after the first 20 minutes were cleared. Music was fantastic too. The best The Witcher content on TV ever, quite possibly the last on Netflix.

The non-black-and-white world that boasts imperfect characters - the \"good\" guys who don't always do the best things and who also screw up. The \"bad\" guys who want to do good and believe they do. The various issues troubling the society, both masses and minorities. A beautiful love story. Amazing combat - anime style, not faithful to the books (but it's fine). A fair, fair portion of lore in it's own adaptation. It's a really great (shonen, I believe?) anime and holding true to that, it changes some things up in the source material. It's definitely to be taken with a grain of salt. But it has managed to pack a lot of good stuff in the short 1.5 hours that it lasts.I suggest keeping an open mind and taking the movie for what it is - a Witcher inspired anime that offers great story, characters, additional backstory and some stunning visuals. I'm also not stating that what was shown that doesn't contradict the books is now to be considered canon, just like other Netflix and CDPR productions it has it's own story and it's up to each of us to treat it as we like. But it was cool and interesting nevertheless.I give the movie a really strong 9/10. After the books and then games, it's my 3rd favourite installment in The Witcher universe."

The story is nothing deep and follows typical fantasy story beats, although a lot of the dark subject matter tackled here is done very well.

      "text": "The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf is a fine movie, it would've been better if they didn't specify this as being a prequel movie about Vesemir's past and just used an original Witcher of their own creation as there are some inconsistencies between this Vesemir and the ones from the books. (For example, the name of his mentor figure)Art & animation 9/10What I'm here for. The style, animation and character and monster designs all look fantastic and are definitely the high point of the movie. My one complaint would be that some of the fights are a bit *too* over the top, making the Witchers look more like demi-Gods than simply mutants whereas the books and games to a lesser extent definitely made it believable that they were still at least somewhat human and somewhat vulnerable.Audio 7/10Music is good and gives off some of the same vibes as certain scores heard in the game, though the song at the start was god-awful (though I assume that was the intent). Voice acting was...good to decent for important characters, less so for everyone else. The voices of any child characters was especially awful, though. At least in my book.Story 6/10The story feels fairly fractured, trying to focus on both Vesemir's backstory and the eventual attack on Kaer Morhen that would eventually lead to the downfall to the School of the Wolf. I would have preferred if they focused on one or the other as both stories are certainly interesting but neither seem to get quite the attention it deserves to truly shine.Overall verdict 7/10The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf looks very impressive, but otherwise isn't terribly memorable and doesn't quite *feel* like a Witcher property. Focusing too much on the big action and fight scenes and too little on the characters and the atmosphere. What scenes that do certainly stand out, however, and as mentioned before the artists and animators deserve a lot of the credit for making this movie what it is.Hopefully any future animated Witcher content will also try to go the extra mile when it comes to writing and voice acting."

This story is not totally canon but d*mn, it really shows how far you can pull the Witcher universe in anime. Really good drawing and voice acting. If you are a Witcher fan this is a must watch."
