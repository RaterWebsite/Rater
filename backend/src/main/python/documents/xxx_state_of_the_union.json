The movie has been further degraded by the overuse of coolness on xxx's part. ok dude, we know u r cool and fearless , ur xxx, after all, u dont need to remind us of that by toughing up ur face and passing a hard comment every 15 minutes. the 1 point out of 10 it deserves is for its creative ideas like flying a boat up on a bridge and stopping a tank using car jacks,, and for its effects."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "It wasn't that bad.
