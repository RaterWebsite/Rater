The villains were horrible, the ending felt forced, there were too many fart jokes, and they tried to make too many jokes that are innapropriate for little kids but that they wouldn't understand, that were there for adults only. Shaggy and Velma actually felt pretty spot-on, characterization and visual-wise, but, Fred and Daphne were off. Fred was arrogant, and Daphne was whiney, which just didn't feel right for either of them. It's sort of a fun movie, but, it has a lot of failed moments and feels like wasted potential."

Scooby is absolutely horrifying and so are the rest of the team. The jokes are completely inappropriate even for its targeted audience. The plot is so insanely predictable and boring.

Except for Fred and Daphnie, the characters are right-on the mark. Fred and Daphnie are actually deeper in the movie than they were in the cartoon. But it is really about Scooby, Shaggy, and the brains of Velma; In other words, it's not the good-looking popular types that save the day, it's the goofy or brainy misfits. A good message to children who may be feeling awkward; showing that even the fearful, goofy or nerdy ones can be cool; and usually turn out to be the coolest. A really fun nostalgic ride. And yes, we all hated Scrappy ;-)"

First things first, Matthew Lillard plays the role of Shaggy brilliantly, it's like the dear (alleged) stoner has been brought to life. Shame about everyone else. The other actors play the role as best as they can, but can't overcome this weak script. Scooby and Scrappy look so fake, theres no way anyone would mistake them for real dogs. And of all the villians to bring into the film, why ue none of them and make Scrappy, the most annoying thing about the cartoon, the bloody villian? The plot is nonsensical, the jokes aren't funny at all and the villians are ill concieved. The traps aren't even as good as the cartoons. At least Sarah Michelle Geller gets to kick ass, Buffy style Like the flintsones, alvin and the chipmunks, Garfield and many (MANY) others, a live action film of a cartoon show does not work. Is there any good live action films based on cartoons? Apart from Death Note and Transformers (1st one), I don't think so. (I'd like to hear if you think theres actually any good live action films based on cartoons, just comment) Just shudder in anticipation for the Smurfs movie"

      "text": "Scooby-Doo was one of the cartoons I grew up with as a kid, plus this came out when I was about 6 or 7 so I grew up with the films too and back then they were awesome, but now...not so much.\rScooby-Doo opens with the case of the Luna Ghost in which Mystery Inc disband due to disagreements which have been piling up over years. 2 years later they are all invited to Spooky Island by Emile Mondavarious to solve a new mystery. However as they try to work individually to solve the mystery they realise they need each other and that this is no normal mystery, that it could lead to the end of the world.\rScooby-Doo is a great kids film but there is nothing there to satisfy anyone older than 9. The story is poorly written, acting is shoddy (a big surprise seeing as Matthew Lillard from films such as Scream  Final Destination plays Shaggy), CGI is poor at best and the camerawork  editing are atrocious.\rAs a 90 minute episode of the TV series this would have been great, but as a live action standalone title Scooby-Doo the movie just doesn't quite cut it to be an averagely good kids film due to some rookie mistakes, but I'm sure the kids will love it either way."

Velma, Shaggy and Scooby in this movie are great and play their roles loyally to their cartoon counterparts, particularly Lillard who seems like he was born to play this role. Sarah Michelle Gellar & Freddie Prinze Jr on the other hand do look the part, but unfortunately it is hard to see them as their characters as they are a bit too high profile for the roles they are playing. Overall this is movie perhaps tries to be a bit too serious at times but is overall good for some plain old fun."

It doesn't aim high, and it's probably not that funny for most people over the age of ten, but it breezes by smoothly enough and the cast members were chosen well.  As everyone who has seen this has already said a million times before, Mathew Lillard was the perfect Shaggy.  He sounds like him, he acts like him, and he looks like him.  It might not even have been on purpose.  He seems like Shaggy in everything he's in, but that doesn't detract from his performance here.  The tone's also not very self serious which helps out a lot.  Bottom line, the movie's alright, but it's also nothing great.  It's formulaic and lacking in inspiration, but it could have been a whole lot worse.  In fact, it probably should have been a whole lot worse.  I can easily imagine a painfully bad version of this movie."

      "text": "On New Years Eve, I rented the Scooby Doo film to watch with my brother. Unlike the Scooby Doo cartoons, this movie is a lot different. The main plot is when the gang catch a ghost and unmask him but due to problems in the gang, they split up which leaves Shaggy and Scooby. Later on, they are all invited to an island called Spooky Island where they have to solve the mystery of the visitors being cursed.\r Some of the things I liked about the movie would have to be the fact that it pretty much retained the Scooby Doo cartoony action and the fight scene with Daphne and Zarkos. It also has a plotline which you would normally find in a cartoon. I like how they made Scrappy Doo the villain this time as he was an annoyance in the cartoon. He was the main reason why the Scooby Doo franchise was ruined in the first place.\r The main problems with the movie were the humor at times was a bit too mature, the higher level of violence and mostly the use of mild language in a movie based on the children's cartoon (it is most notable in the ending cutscene when Scrappy says \"I would have got away with it if it weren't for you meddling son of a-\". I felt that the movie would have done better without those additions.\r Overall, I think it is best that kids avoid this movie as it is more violent than the cartoons, it has humor that they will not understand and there is mild language in certain parts. Some people might find the movie good though but others may want to avoid this movie."

I thought Scooby Doo a colourful film, with some good direction, and very good performances from all involved. The best of the cast were Matthew Lilliard as Shaggy and Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne, and Rowan Atkinson is amusing as Mondavarious. The film is very amusing at times, especially the scene when Scooby dresses as a Grandma and the scenes in the haunted house. The actress of Mary-Jane is very sweet too. But I will say that the film isn't without its flaws. The plot is a little far-fetched, and some of the farting jokes are very silly. There have been complaints of the Scooby Doo model being charmless, but I disagree. He was quite sweet at times. The only character I didn't really like that much was Scrappy, then again I never did like him, not even in the animated series. Despite these flaws, this film is not bad at all, and I will award a 7/10. Bethany Cox"

      "text": "If anyone wanted to see the hot crap that comes out of the people in charge of Warner Brothers this is it. This movie is a clear indication of what it means to put big name celebrities with no place in a movie simply to garner their following to be interested. The biggest positive of this movie is that the animation was brilliant, but that is about it. If you are a Scooby Doo fan you will only find disappointment as they force jokes upon jokes to try to stay relevant in today\u2019s youth while trying to blend the past at the same time? It was actually quite confusing why the decision was made to make a movie that is placed in the past, but blends today\u2019s pop culture? One argument that is ridiculous to hear is that this movie was aimed towards kids, and let me stop you right there. Scooby Doo is a IP that was already aimed at kids leaving them no use to actually dumb down the characters more. They in turned decided to disrespect the IP and force depth into characters that didn\u2019t need depth. I found myself wondering why certain plot points caused conflict other than the fact that it was easier for the plot to progress. In the end, the movie basically was a huge disappointment to anyone who was hoping to see a reboot of their favorite dog. Another note I\u2019ve noticed is the constant positive reviews about this movie giving it 10 out of 10\u2019s. When I see many big named Youtuber\u2019s and Blog\u2019s giving this a 10 out of 10 it makes me wonder how much did WB pay for Influencers. This movie is not a 10 out of 10, it is a poor written cluster bomb of plot holes and missed opportunities. Shame on you WB for allowing this to end up as cheap as another VHS quick release. The original voice actors deserve better than this and to be honest, they didn\u2019t miss out if this is what was end result."

However, Scooby-Doo lovers are sure to get a kick out of this movie, and its humour, despite its many flaws."
