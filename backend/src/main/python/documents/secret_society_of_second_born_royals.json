Seriously, do not be fooled, this was a waste of time."

      "text": "It's a bad movie. The acting isn't good, the writing doesn't help and the budget wasn't very good either, but it is possible to enjoy (if you drastically lower your standards). If you want something nice to watch with your 7-12 year old kids, give it a watch to pass the time. Otherwise, look elsewhere"
