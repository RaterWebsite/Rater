      "text": "It has become obvious that Disney+ is largely a dumping ground for any inferior content generated either accidentally by Disney or intentionally (like in the heyday of their direct-to-video sequels).Expecting SSoSBR to be good based on the trailer (which is more enjoyable than the movie) is foolish.Predictable, dull, thin garbage.  Seriously, do not be fooled, this was a waste of time."

      "text": "It's a bad movie. The acting isn't good, the writing doesn't help and the budget wasn't very good either, but it is possible to enjoy (if you drastically lower your standards). If you want something nice to watch with your 7-12 year old kids, give it a watch to pass the time. Otherwise, look elsewhere"
