Flanagan has been on a run lately, Oculus was solid horror, Hill House was very popular (I found it boring) and this is a well photographed, nice looking movie.  Alex Essoe does a good impression of Shelly Duvall.  Ewan McGregor does a good job of never steering attention away from story or toward himself.  Snakebite is the most interesting character, besides Abra (Kyliegh Curran) she was great.  There are parts that remind me of The Dark Crystal, in a good way.  Well made, not much action but it never drags at all in 3 hours."

      "text": "2017's Gerald's Game was a huge surprise for a lot of people. The book it's based on is largely comprised of imaginary conversations taking place in the protagonist's head, and many thought it impossible for that to be translated to film. Mike Flanagan pulled it off though. Showing that he could bring Stephen King's more difficult to portray material to life onscreen with great effectiveness and creating one of the best adaptations of any of the author's work to date in the process.I'd argue he faced a greater challenge with Doctor Sleep however. Not only does a significant portion of the action once again take place inside the minds of the characters, but the story also serves as sequel to The Shining. This put Flanagan in the unenviable position of having to decide whether or not he actually wanted to make this a direct follow-up to the legendary Kubrick film, or forsake any such connections and try to make it as self-contained as possible. No matter what the director chose, The Shining would always be a part of the conversation due to the shared continuity of their source materials, but the latter option did at least come with the potential to avoid some of the harsher scrutiny that would likely arise from establishing this as a continuation of what some consider to be the single greatest piece of horror cinema ever created.Flanagan ultimately took the risk and went the sequel route. Tweaking a few things from the novel in the process so that it could tie in better with Kubrick's version of The Shining. A decision that might have actually been beneficial to the story as it allowed him to remain very faithful to the source material while giving him a means to cut out King's ridiculous surprise relative twist. The new ending also redeems the lack of fidelity inherent in the Kubrick film by managing to stay true to the heart and soul of both books at the same time.While the events that occurred in The Shining are significant in that they define who Danny is in this movie, outside of the final act that's a little too heavy on nostalgia-based scene recreations Doctor Sleep largely does its own thing and in its own way. Even to the point kind of moving away from straight horror in favor of something more akin to dark fantasy. For the majority of it's lengthy running-time it's decidedly not Kubrick which allows it to succeed on its own merits, of which there are many.This is one haunting piece of cinema with some truly horrific moments that will stick with you. It's a violent tale of mind-bending psychic warfare with a strong dramatic component centered around PTSD, regret, and the desire for redemption in a cruel, hungry world. All of which is backed by incredible performances across the board. Rebecca Ferguson's natural accent slips through once or twice making the weakest link, but her sexy yet terrifying villain is so memorable that it almost goes by unnoticed.I would really love to see Flanagan tackle more King in the future. The author has often experimented with more fantastical conceits of the mind and many directors have struggled making those ideas work onscreen. Flanagan however has pulled it off twice now with stunning results. Doctor Sleep is incredibly gripping. Pop-culture's obsession with the '80s throwback shows up here near the end and finds the director putting on an unnecessary Kubrick impression, but that's the single misstep in a movie that's otherwise confident enough to build upon and branch off from its predecessor in order to take a different path that cements it as a worthy successor and an excellent film in its own right.9.3/10"

The changes from the book worked perfectly for cinema.  His tributes to kubrick were also surprising and cool.I so strongly recommend seeing the movie in theatres.

Ewan McGregor plays the adult version of the little boy who was scarred by the events in the original movie. He's still coping with the ghosts (literally) from that time, when a teenager appears who also has extrasensory powers. They embark on a search to stop a truly merciless group who prey on the pain of children (the most brutal scene in the film). This story takes 2.5 hours to unfold and doesn't even get to the fateful hotel until the final 30 minutes. Through it all, there's a sense of dread, accompanied with some cool visual effects and ominous sound design. The pace never quickens and there aren't any big scares, but the compelling story and Mike Flanagan's engrossing direction create a continual level of tension."

The pacing is quite a lot faster than the book, yet still feels a bit long... The film is also not very scary, which I knew going in due to the book, it's definitely a different vibe from the first shining film. This film takes much more from the Stephen King side than the first film, so since of Kings kinda cornyness comes into the film too, I think it might have been nice to have more of the film set in the hotel, even though it's not in the book at all, also wish we had more time letting the ghosts get more screen time. Other than that, everything was great. Making the true knot scary and foreboding and not hokey and corny was really really well done. The Turing of the world to enter others minds was also visually stunning."

      "text": "\u201cHi there\u201dHello there...Mike Flanagan has some of the biggest balls in the horror industry. I mean just look at his filmography so far.He took one of the worst horror movies in recent memory \u2018Ouija\u2019 and said: \u201cyeah, I wanna make a sequel to that\u201d, with \u2018Ouija: Origin of Evil\u2019 and somehow made it less terrible. How about \u2018Haunting of Hill House\u2019 where he\u2019s going to direct every episode of a television series that has to weave two narratives together at once over ten episodes...and again he somehow made it work. And now this guy is gonna make a sequel to one of the most revered horror movies of all time with \u2018Doctor Sleep\u2019...the son of b**ch did it again!I think Flanagan deserves more credit as a director rather than people **** that his movies \u201cain't scary enough an-\u201d blah blah blah shut the hell up.\u2018Doctor Sleep\u2019 was a complete surprise for all the right reasons. At first I wasn\u2019t sure if the movie would hook me, because it takes awhile for it to get going, but slowly I got invested in the story and the characters. There have been four Stephen King movie adaptions this year: \u2018Pet Sematary\u2019, \u2018IT Chapter Two\u2019, \u2018In The Tall Grass\u2019, and now this movie. This is by far the best out of them all.The runtime is 152 minutes long and I can safely say that the movie is 85% it\u2019s own thing, because it doesn't just rely on nostalgia to tell their story and it\u2019s only the last act where things start to play on nostalgia when the characters return to the Overlook Hotel. The nostalgia being the 80\u2019s horror classic of course. It\u2019s either that or 97 TV mini-series. Who\u2019s got fond memories for that piece of sh*t? So with this being both a sequel to Kubrick's movie and King\u2019s original novel; a clash of visions coming together with Flanagan trying to put this together, while also applying his own vision into the mix.Now that\u2019s hard.The part that got me invested in the story was the scene between Danny and a elderly patient who\u2019s on their death bed. Danny comforts them as their peacefully past away, without dying alone. It\u2019s a beautiful and heartfelt scene that you would never expect to see in a supernatural horror movie.Ewan Mcgregor was fantastic as an alcoholic grown-up Danny Torrance. Nicholson's presence was felt through out the movie as adult Danny fears he might follow in his fathers footsteps. There\u2019s a scene where Danny gives a talk at a rehab group and as doing so he reflects deeply on everything that happened to him in the past, while the camera is locked on Ewan\u2019s face. Not only from his childhood, but everything afterwards and drowning out the trauma through drinking - something that us as the audience don\u2019t see. I thought he was excellent. He absolutely \u201cshines\u201d as the character...and am not sorry for that pun.I loved how fleshed out the villains were, which surprised me the most about the movie. They are like vampires, but instead of feasting on blood, it\u2019s \u201cthe shining\u201d they crave for a expanded life. Casual and charming, and yet wickedly evil. There\u2019s a particularly scene that was so difficult to watch and really got under my skin. However you do get to see them interreacting with each other in normal conversations as they casually go on with the day and work as a group. Rose the Hat sticks out from the rest as a sinister and endearing villian played marvelously by Rebecca Ferguson.Mike Flanagan dose a great job on balancing both Kubrick\u2019s and King\u2019s version respectfully, but also manages to put his visual spin in. The one thing that hasn\u2019t been mention yet is how great he is with child actors as he always gets the best performance out of them, especially Jacob Tremblay and Kyliegh Curran who was so convincing in the roles it was scary.The movie looks stunning with the use of colors adding to the overall tone and helps creates the horror atmosphere. Same thing with the score that while it takes samples from Kubrick\u2019s movie, but not to say it doesn\u2019t have it\u2019s own.For issues:There was a couple of callbacks that was a little on the noise, usually through references. As I said early the movie takes a while to find it\u2019s footing and you couldn\u2019t help but draw comparisons. There were a few questionable and almost silly lines that King himself would inject into his work for humor, but here, with tone in mind, just took the fear out of it.Overall rating: \u201cEat well and live long.\u201d"

How would one change the course of the Titanic if it continued it's course, eventually\u00a0 barreling along at light speed? Solve that equation &one could be wealthy beyond all dreams of avarice. How could one follow up, The Shining?Mike Flanagan doesn't flinch from the gravity of this two body problem, but embraces it with DS, his adaptation of the best selling novel by SK - not only the sequel to one of the seminal horror novels of the 20th Century but a visually influential &a most recently gentrified motion picture adapted by Stanley Kubrick. Seems like unsolvable Calculus, right? A tough aldorithmic nut.\u00a0 The director of Occulus, Gerald's Game &Hulu's The Haunting of Hill House rolls up his sleeves, grabs the chalk &heads to the chalkboard.Like King's other works such as IT &The Stand, the novel\u00a0DS defies the feature length treatment. Unlike King's 1977 best seller\u00a0The Shining, DS has many more points of view &locations, in addition to the added weight of literary &cinematic history. To complicate matters, Kubrick's The Shining wasn't embraced at the box office by Constant Watchers or Critics. Regardless, MF opts for the feature treatment rather than a limited run series.\u00a0 Apparently, he's not one to shy from eating a historic literary elephant - so he does that, one bite at a time.MF does that deftly, spending a decent portion of the first act re-anchoring us in the 40 year old story - but never through exposition. Some of us are \"reintroduced\" to Danny Torrance, Wendy Torrance &Dick Halloran. For those Constant Readers &Constant Watchers, it's an unsentimental walk through memory lane that's not done for the sake of nostalgia or as some will posit with a contemporary slur, fan service. That's key - to play to those not versed in the vocabulary of The Overlook lore \u00ac explain too much to the already initiated. Again, pretty sophisticated equation balancing.\u00a0 Off the page, MF never visually imitates Kubrick's austere, antiseptic style as lightly emulates it. MF gives us small visual cues, in addition to a few subtle aural ones as well.Stage setting &character introduction done, we fast forward to the new &unfamiliar for the next three acts. In the vocabulary of Mid World, another King creation, the World of DS - specifically Danny's World - has moved on from that of The Shining's, by 40 years or so. Where these acts work best are developing adult Danny as a compelling character, which Constant Readers will recognize as a parallel to that of the struggling, tragically alcoholic Jack Torrance of the novel - not the mustachio twisting villain of Kubrick's film - &new faces Abra Stone, Billy Freeman, Crow Daddy, Snakebite Andi &Rose the Hat.MF does his best to balance the narrative, but King's story is rich with detail &viewpoint. Narratively, The Knot - the tight knit order of psychic vampires driving the plot - overshadow our protagonists Danny &Abra's respective plights. Of note, there are no glaring storytelling missteps along the way, but this film isn't The Green Mile, anchored to one location &a simple theme. There's a lot happening of import \u2062's all over the literal geographic map. Like most road trips there are side jaunts &colorful road attractions. It is a long haul, sometimes with jeopardy, interesting scenery chewing &all. Some devotees of Kubrick's precursor will take umbrage at this. But, this is a different story. One with an unexpected twist.SK had issue with the liberties Kubrick took with the best selling novel. The novel was not problematic, it was virtually perfect \u2208 no need of revision. The opposite is the case in 2019. King's novel DS is problematic. It lacks a satisfying conclusion. Fortunately, Kubrick's inadequate resolution gave MF an opportunity to make right the mistakes of Kubrick's film &King's sequel. The fourth &fifth acts are that long awaited payoff. Nostalgia driven fans of the film will be rewarded, though not in the way they anticipate. We revisit two skeletons in Danny's closet. We've seen it in the previews. The other is a delightful surprise. MF also gives us the resolution that Constant Readers expected in 1980. \"It creeps\" up on us.Does the calculus finally give us the Grand Unified Theory of King's Universe? No, it merely extends the framework &displays a fundamental understanding of the author which eluded Kubrick. That tasks was Herculean &thankless given expectations set by two novels &a previous film. There isn't a single mistake in DS, on the page or on the screen. The dialogue &the performances are spot on. But, it's the theory - the premise of the story ultimately hamstrings MF. Regardless, he took his duty seriously &studiously - DS is a polished, entertaining movie which stands on its own merits. MF is a mindful custodian of the King's universe."

There were some really cool shots in this film that I wish I could talk about but trust me when I saw there are some shots that are brilliant in how they look. Now, the acting in this film was good from everybody and there was really only one-person who slightly blew me away and that was Ewan McGregor. He took everybody on a journey with this character. From the beginning of the film to the end you always feel bad for Dan and just want the best for him. Kyliegh Curran, I can see her doing great work in the future. Rebecca Ferguson did an okay job as Rose the hat but she doesn\u2019t really become a standout until the end of the movie. The pacing in this film is definitely slow in the beginning and picks up the pace towards the end. I have to applaud the set designers for what they did to the Overlook Hotel. The musical score, done by the Newton Brothers, may not be as iconic as the original movie but you can hear elements from that movie. In the end, this movie is a good sequel to The Shining but if you want to watch this movie, I would recommend not watching the trailer because, in my opinion, it gave away a lot of the good parts of this movie."

Despite Doctor Sleep\u2019s occasional moments of weakness (either in the script or in the performances) the cinematography is stunning, the reconstruction of the Overlook is impressive, and the way the film pays tribute to Kubrick - from the opening notes to the credit music - successfully contextualizes this thriller within The Shining\u2019s cinematic legacy. Kubrick\u2019s vision was one of a kind - and mere hints of his genius sprinkled throughout Doctor Sleep are enough to remind us of this fact."

      "text": "There are no words to describe how bad this film is. The plot is a god awful derivative mashup of The Stand and It, with horrible effects, dodgy acting (Rebecca Ferguson is utterly unconvincing and Ewan McGregor sleepwalks through with line after line of exposition). Hell, they even threw in a bad Jack Nicholson impersonator. Then, like sprinkling some gold leaf on a dog turd, they had the cheek to intercut bits of the The Shining! Everyone involved should be ashamed."

The acting is underwhelming, as is the script. It's also way too long. All in all this was not a pleasant viewing experience and I would not recommend to anyone."

      "text": "It is the old style filmmaking residing between the temperament that warms the tea and whistles the kettle. I'd like to have a cup of that.Doctor SleepMike Flanagan who directed and adapted this controversial novelization for the screen is an apt choice to voice the second swing by Stephen King on Dan's character and the supernatural element it possesses. Why controversial? It actually is like being in a tug of war game where you are the price. But I think Flanagan found a sweet spot, that gray area that any horror director would love to have in plenty. And that is why his procedure that takes its time properly, gets the job done. It couldn't be more book-ish. It reeks of old book and I love every aspect of that. Each character, every fabric of information that stacks and builds the final countdown brick by brick is simply novelizing.No regrets. If you have to host a news show as such, you have to stage it like this. No need to celebrate or electrify, just words floating around, so loud, so big that even performance and other characteristics gets overlapped by King's vision. In this sense it feels, I don't want to say anti-Kubrick but definitely pro-King. But you can only walk far away if you are expecting for the audience to read this story on screen rather than experience.Ergo, comes these stills and thrills that has the mind bending look that appears like Stanley Kubrick's dream. The swooshing and whooshing of the adrenaline rush that warps these characters to their self-created reality and the deafening snapping of reality that wakes them up. Another asset is of course Ewan McGregor as Dan with this time axe on HIS hands. McGregor's performance is magnificent, child like it seems to me, even though he tells it to be inspired from Jack Nicholson's madness. He cries when he is terrified and falls for the easiest motion that exists. All in all, Doctor Sleep is a functioning system. You don't see that nowadays."

      "text": "This is supposed to be a horror movie but the villains were not scary because the protagonist is more powerful than them from the beginning. They are all dispatched with ease. Boring characters and bland acting, especially compared to the The Shining. No suspense and mostly predictable with a few cool spots here and there. A very disappointing sequel to one of the best horrors ever."
