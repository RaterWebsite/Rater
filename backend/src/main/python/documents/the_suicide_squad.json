The plot was well done, and interesting the part at the end of the US involvement in the project and leading to casualty and peacemaker fight was really well made. James Gunn wrote a great story. THe performance too was amazing. Margot Robbie killed it as HQ and the other characters acting too was great. The casting was spot on. The reworked characters like Rick Flag and others had a good arc than the first one. It was also good to see the movie being cruel and R-rated rather than DC trying to make it Pg-13 allowing the characters to be truly themselves. The last 1-hour fight too was well made. A great movie well done."

More humour and the charisma of Cena/Elba on top of that. The film was a bit long at times. The actions was mostly fine. The music was in tone. The acting was amazing and surely, the most redeeming factor in this movie. I give it 75%. Go see that movie for the actors and how James Gunn got the best out of them."

Surprisingly I did not expect much from Ratcatcher 2 but i found her character really well done. For me the star of the movie was obviously Bloodsport and Peacemaker but the way Idris fit in so well between action and comedy showed how good of an actor he is especially with the scene involving him and Viola Davis.Not too sure how some people are complaining about it not having a plot when their mission was explained maybe 3 or 4 times throughout the movie with chapter titles.Id give this movie a 7.5 had some solid action some fun jokes may not work for everybody but it definitely did for me."

Even villains unknown to those that might not be familiar who don't read comics, such as myself, were brought alive in an interesting way. Especially Polka Dot Man and Ratcatcher 2 stood out, but all the characters and actors did a great job.Would definitely like another Suicide Squad movie in this vein if James Gunn is behind it, doesn't even have to be this squad. Can just be another squad of anti-heroes and villain protagonist as long as it's half this interesting."

In the end and after reflecting on it I\u2019d say it does all come together, but I can imagine some viewers feeling like they were put through the paces as even I\u2019m not sure what this movie wanted to be. With it\u2019s very large and excellent cast it felt mostly hindered in the small interactions as there\u2019s something about a James Gunn movie that makes the dialogue feel like dialogue and not coming off as genuine. That\u2019s not always bad with a movie that\u2019s pulled from the pages of a comic and it doesn\u2019t really impede the narrative. You just feel that with the numerous characters so many are under utilized and only on screen as an unnecessary device. That may be because there are so many twists to keep the audience guessing and unaware as to where the story is going, but not everything felt fleshed out. There\u2019s a reoccurring sight gag for a character who describes themself as having mental illness that I just didn\u2019t find funny in the end and I\u2019m still not sure if I\u2019m supposed to. All in all if you have HBO Max and want a dark DC comic movie for a night in, this is pretty good. Just don\u2019t bring the kids. It earned the R rating with constant and gory kills."

      "text": "I really loved The Suicide Squad. The Suicide Squad was able to win me over as the best DCEU movie in the first 10 minutes of its run time. The Suicide Squad is unique, not feeling like most superhero flicks before it. Warner Brothers is no longer trying to copy the Marvel Cinematic Universe and it\u2019s working out really well.    The film was able to manage being really dark, without falling into the same traps that the Snyderverse set for itself. The Snyderverse sometimes tries to be extra gritty in an attempt to stand out, but it can sometimes lead to really boring scenes. That\u2019s a comment I make as a Snyderverse fan.    Some other things I liked about the movie were the editing, the cast, and the special effects. I went into the movie without doubts about the quality of the acting and special effects, but I did doubt the editing would be anything to write home about. Thankfully, the movie exceeded all of my expectations in those areas.    I also think that this movie works as a great James Gunn movie. The soundtrack really works well, something you can always look forward to in a Gunn flick. I was worried about the movie possibly using all its jokes in the trailer, but I was dead wrong. The movie is hilarious.    If I had to recommend the movie to anyone, I\u2019d recommend it to comic book fans, people who aren\u2019t turned off by gore, and people who don\u2019t take themselves too seriously."

      "text": "After the above average Suicide Squad comes a new one, this time from James Gunn, and I can tell you it's good. In the first few minutes, we're introduced to the characters. They are, in my opinion, better and much more memorable. The best for me is still Harley Quinn, who could not be played by anyone other than the wonderful Margot Robbie. As for the new characters, I quite liked King Shark there. Next up are some excellent action scenes, which are unusually frequent for DC. Aside from being frequent, they are really good and Gunn's hand has made his mark on the CGI here, as Weasel like this reminded me slightly of Rocket from Guardians of the Galaxy. Where else the change in the director's chair was felt is without a doubt the music, which was really great and I devoured some scenes because they were epic, although I would add that there's not much play on any epicness here. In fact, the film throws in one joke after another. If you found 2016's Suicide Squad too \"serious\", then I have good news for you because the darker atmosphere has been replaced with a funnier one. To sum it all up. For me, a good film that has rectified the reputation of Suicide Squad and I wouldn't complain at all if there was a sequel that built on this 2021 Suicide Squad and forgot about the 2016 one. I'm not a hater of the older one. In my opinion, it had a darker atmosphere and smaller doses of jokes that I liked about it. But otherwise, the new Suicide Squad offered us much more and I can recommend it."

What I loved about Gunn' style was funny, wit, irony-fueled dialogues mixed with epicness and wholesomeness; in The Suicide Squad you'll have a just a tiny drop of that. There's a lot of creativity, indeed, and some characters and their actors are wonderful \u2013 especially John Cena, who holds probably holds the movie on his own shoulders \u2013 but the plot is weak as well as the bond that we manage to create with such characters. A nice movie, but not the small revolution that Guardians was!"

On the minus, the story is a bit messed up, some of the characters could have seen more development (polka dot for example instead of ratcatcher 2), some characters are redundant (Harley, surprisingly), others are \"too much\" and inconsequent (Starro). The movie is okay-ish. Worth a re-view but nothing more. Still lacks the depth of Guardians for instance but still shows a significant potential. A bit long. Some sequences could have been shortened. Still enjoyable to some extent. Oh, and some gore is unnecessary."

I couldn't agree with anything anyone else was saying on the movie. I highly enjoyed the movie, I do not think one point dragged on for too long, or was too short. The movie was paced perfectly while blending together some great action scenes. There was more humor than normal for a DC movie and it was a welcomed addition. The characters were all likeable.

      "text": "Well....this movie was insane, I mean really insane, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film. This is more of a comparison than a review, but I will kinda of review it. I'm gonna start with what I think this film did better than David Ayer's Suicide Squad and then say what I think David Ayer's Suicide Squad did better than James Gunn's The Suicide Squad.What I think it did better than David Ayer's film:The Cinematography and the action sequences: By the looks of it the action sequences were done more practically than in Ayer's version, takes were longer and more of the action was visible than Ayer's. The action sequences were beautifully shot, the camera was always following the action so you wouldn't miss much.The Visual Effects & Costume Design: Surprisingly the visual effects in this film was phenomenal, I wasn't expecting it to look as good as it did, especially the CGI character of King Shark, the detail on his skin was mind-blowingly good, he really look real, yes I know he really isn't a regular shark given that he's walking around like a human but that's how good it was to me, plus the big baddie at the end Starro, once you were able to see what it looked like I was stunned at how well it blended in the live action elements, like King Shark the detail on Starro was insanely good. Now the costumes are exactly as I was expecting, when you have characters like Polka Dot Man, TDK, Javelin, and Peacemaker who are some the lesser known DC villain's who you consider C, D, or even lower grade villains of course their costumes are going to be absolutely ridiculous, and they totally are, but they looked amazing, some of them were vibrant with color as given so much detail that they looked awesome. Bloodsport and Harley Quinn's costumes were the standouts for me, I thought Bloodsports mask was freaking awesome, I got a Xenomorph vibe from it which was cool as hell, and Harley's costume felt like it was ripped from the comic pages itself, especially the two tone color scheme.Some of the Lead and \"Some of the\" Supporting Cast: Idris Elba's Bloodsport and John Cena's Peacemaker were real standout among this ridiculously massive and star packed cast, especially how funny the two of them were especially when the two were trying to kill people in a more creative way as a way to prove who's better at killing. Daniela Melchior and David Dastmalchian as Ratcatcher 2 and Polka Dot Man were the emotional core of the film, Gunn really did a great job getting you to really feel for these characters and their backstories. Viola Davis as expected did a fantastic job as Amanda Waller, and Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag made a HUGE improvement from the previous film, he wasn't as wooden as he was before.Gunn's Signature Style: This film is very reminiscent of Gunn's Style of film from before he did Guardians of the Galaxy, they were screwed up and gory as hell, the fact that Warner Bros let him use that for a comic book movie is actually refreshing in the massive market of comic movies and shows, every now and then you have to change things up to keep it interesting and I'm happy he could let loose with this movie.Now I really didn't like David Ayer's Suicide Squad but I'll admit there are some things I think it did a little better:The Soundtrack: I know it's weird to start this off with that, but to be honest the music in Ayer's version is superior by quite a margin, I listen to a lot it's music still 5 years later, I mean come on, Skrillex, Lil Wayne, Twenty One Pilots, War, CCR, Rolling Stones, Wiz Khalifa, Imagine Dragons, Queen, Eminem! So many artists, it was a little disappointing but I'll admit that a good chunk of the budget for Gunn's version went to that ridiculously massive cast, so this a bit of nit pick.Pacing, The off-putting Animal Cruelty, and Unnecessary Character Deaths: Ok, before I start, the whole Animal Cruelty thing, it's a nitpick also, i just didn't really understand why it needed to in the film, but this is coming from James Gunn's twisted mind, so I guess i should've expected it, but it just a tad too much. Now the pacing was a little slow when  it came to the 2nd act of Gunn's version, but there was a lot of character development that needed to happen, but Ayer's version flowed better in my honest opinion given it was shorter. Finally, them character deaths, when they killed Slipknot in Ayer's version it sucked but it needed to happen, but when Boomerang, Flagg, and Polka Dot Man were killed off, it really didn't make much sense to me, especially Boomerang and Polka Dot Man.Overall, I loved The Suicide Squad, it was an insanely fun and hilarious film packed to the brim with some awesome bloody and gorey action sequences some surprisingly outstanding VFX and a great cast with some awesome on screen chemistry was damn near perfect, but that second act slowed it a tad too much and some of the characters should of have more screen time, but James Gunn delivers it in style."
