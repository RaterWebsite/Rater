Hemsworth has been involved only for Glamour and stardom, there was absolutely no strong character or pre-story behind Agent H. The story revolve around Tessa Thompson, Protagonist. All the supporting characters, Including Liam Neeson couldn't save the film. I clearly missed humor of previous MIB movies, Could hardly laugh despite hearing Kumail Nanjiani's voice. Overall, If they are planning to do it again, I will strongly recommend them device a strong plot."

To then limply reach a thoroughly predictable and underwhelming conclusion that could have been written by a 7 year old.To find some positives, the visuals are perfectly acceptable (most of the time), the soundtrack is inoffensive, and the cast do what they can with the miserable screen play they were given.This project should have been canned, or at least shelved until they could get a competent writer on board to give them something worth making a film for. Instead of reinvigorating this franchise, I believe they have killed it. Which is a real shame.3/10, don\u2019t waste time or money on this. Catch it on Netflix in 2 months time if you really want to."

In this Movie the producers make the same boring old mistake.. the main protagonist is flawless from the get go. no character progression, no needs, just a \"want this\" and some over worldly mad skills derived out of (shown) nowhere and being at the right place at the right time because the flawlessness of the main protagonist was supposed to be there.. no struggle, no flight, no development no personal involvement.. It's like Hollywood forgot how to make good and interessting movies.. i hope this era of Highjacking films for clumsy remakes goes away very soon.."

In this movie both Helmsworth and the girl were both wierdo goofs. Helmsworth was too busy flitting around with his pretty boy B.S. and the girl was just wierd. That means there was no strong character foil for both to play off each other. Next, the storyline was convoluted and difficult to follow. Because of the name 'international' in the title they now had to figure out how to get different countries in the film and because of that, the writers had a hard time. I give this one star and a half. The worst MIB movie to date."

There is absolutely nothing entertaining about following an obnoxiously plucky, hyper-competent, characterless, unfunny protagonist in your sci-fi comedy film. This character isn't given any stakes or strong motivations. This character doesn't struggle at any point. This character doesn't learn anything throughout the story. She's boring to the point of infuriating. It certainly doesn't help that no one else in this movie is funny either. Bad comedies are probably the most unfortunate type of bad movie. Most bad movies have the potential of being funny by virtue of how bad they are. Bad comedies are already inherently unfunny. They're effectively worthless. That's what this movie is: worthless."

Gary Gray, I thought, usually is the guy to carry on franchises with equal respect as they start on with. If not increase the hype but will surely continue the momentum of the chase that drives the fans to cinema. Of course, these are all hypothetical thoughts you wander before going on in this cash grab chapter of a popular franchise that lately has been struggling aplenty in order to be politically correct, compromising both quality and the agenda that births that whole drama; ironic, right! Now, before I go through train of various disappointing elements, let me point out the primary and the surprising one.The visual effects and physical sequences- the one thing these big banner film thrives for- are practically straight out wrong, as in they have somehow forgot to account in the distance and time factor in doing so; from showcasing a vehicle zooming, to a creature in a jetpack boosting off, it is odd and uncomfortable to swallow all. And on the other hand, the best asset is the creativity on how varied number of creatures are presented, these tiny aspects keep giving us hope in this overlong two hours of journey- basically a slow death.The storytelling mostly follows the Copy-Paste system from other passable buddy cop films which to be frank isn't done properly, ergo, the result is worse than that. The antics, nothing but loud bangs, the jokes, desperate attempts for cheap shot and emotions, fairly shallow. The only character that you are going to look forward to, is Kumail Nanjiani's voicing as Pawny whose affirmatively positive comments are flat out hilarious. Men In Black: International, the name gives it all away, from the locations to the transparency of the characters, I mean still holding on to their obvious hidden card, is not actually arrogant but simply ignorant."

      "text": "I long for the days when writers in Hollywood actually cared about their creative content. There are so many movie franchises that should have ended years ago, such as The Terminator saga, Toy Story, Star Wars, Jurassic Park, and Pirates of the Caribbean. These filmmakers can't just leave what's already great alone. Of course, there are a few exceptions every here and there. However, Men In Black: International is not one of them. The majority of awful sequels these days definitely outweighs the anomalies. There are some moviegoers who don't mind Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson being paired together in this film. Needless to say, these two were already featured once before in Thor: Ragnarok. With MIB: International, it doesn't feel like a MIB movie without Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith. They should have stopped after MIB III. Most people don't want non-Marvel movies to imitate Marvel comic book films. It's not necessary, it's just cringe. Yes, this includes the casting. It may have been better to replace Thompson's character with Will Smith's. This way, Agent J, who is Will Smith, can show Chris Hemsworth the ropes. On second thought, it's not like this hasn't already been done before. Like I said before, this series ideally was supposed to end with MIB III. The golden guideline for screenwriters should be aiming for a trilogy, not winging it and milking it with four films, or five, or six movies. It's too much. Copycats are the last thing that Hollywood needs right now. Creative writing in this 21st century has become a forgotten necessity in the film industry. They care more about their politics than they do about their stories and characters."

Though this hasn't been dealt nearly as bad of a hand as, say, \"Hellboy\" or \"Dark Phoenix,\" I still can't see how someone could look at all of the rumors of on-set rewrites and bureaucratic in-fighting and call this \"business as usual\" blockbuster filmmaking. \"Men In Black: International\" is messily plotted, featuring low-brow humor and character work, and an overall lack of the kind of wonderment and fun that made the prior successes so memorable.

Agent H: The greatest field agent that never actually saved the world. He is completely incompetent, and is not knowledgeable of almost anything. Basically, he's a party boy who used his good looks to swarm his way to the top. Agent M(olly): Mary Sue, who was a shut in her entire life, yet is not socially awkward. Has never been in a fight, but defeats a galactic goddess of death. A hacker who used NASA sites to track down MIB actions, while also TURNING DOWN the FBI and CIA, but don't think about that too hard.... Then waltz's into MIB headquarters, to get interrogated which turns into a job interview. She gives the female chief a few fashion complements, and tells her she's smart and has no life. Gets hired on the spot.Now, immediately gets to choose her weapon, is a complete dbag, disses the name of the whole organization. \"Men in Black, why not people in Black, or humans in Black?\".... It's based on a myth about aliens who obduct people. They look like emotionless creatures, dressed in all black suits, and resemble Men... Men in Black... Ffs....Brand new agent, just gets sent on a special duty to England.. ya know, as new recruits do. Is following top agents around, just casually hangs out with a top agent. F's up the mission, that's fine.Ends up obtaining a super weapon, that at some point in the movie she fires just because, creates a Grand canyon in the middle of the desert. And not one government agency shows up. Then travels to the goddess of death whom she defeats, who apparently has extremely high security system with many bodyguards, but she just gets on the island because they weren't paying attention or something. Basically like Bond villains, in a world where there's a secret agency above the CIA or FBI surveillance, but apparently have ADT security systems LOL.A psych out ending, with the villains that have been built up being a bait and switch.   Confronts actual villain, this is where it is revealed that agent h never actually save the world. Apparently High T has always been possessed since 2016.  Pawns grappling hook can withstand a black hole / vortex that can make people travel across the universe. agent h gets the keys to the whole organization, despite not actually saving the world, despite not being  competent in almost any single particular way, and his main rival in the organization gives him the keys because of respect or some BS. And he gets the nomination because the possessed high T, had recommended him before as a good leader. Despite not having shown one single good leadership quality.  Agent m knows how to fly the cars and everything, just cause... Guaranteed the people who say they like this film, willl have the most generic responses. the people that dislike this film, will tell you exactly why it was trash.Man I don't feel like typing anymore there is just so much wrong with this movie, and I will never trust an angry Joe review"
