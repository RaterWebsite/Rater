The way he sets up and executes dramatic conversational moments without overplaying his hand is  remarkable. Isaac, Chastain, and Oyelowo are at the absolute head of the class, and they are each pitch perfect in this film. About halfway through the proceedings, I wanted so badly to have this movie serve as the pilot to a new dramatic series. But by the end I was so happy that it stands alone and does so so powerfully."

      "text": "The titular year is 1981 in New York City. The owner of a fuel oil company and his wife (Oscar Issac and Jessica Chastain) struggle to grow their business, despite violent attacks on their trucks and an impending investigation. His lofty plan is to maintain his principles in the process, a conflict that dominates the dialogue. The movie takes itself very seriously and so do the actors. While their performances are so passionate, the sluggish pace slows the momentum. The dark cinematography is more murky than noir. Then there's the writing, which lays out the plotting in many predictable beats. What looks to be a hard-hitting crime actioner turns out to be an interesting, but not especially compelling character drama."

      "text": "This film is a visual delight for people who fondly remember the New York-based movies of the 1970's and early 80's -- \"French Connection\" comes to mind.  In the end, though, the story is too weak to make a great film.  The film's protagonist, Abel Morales, runs a heating oil company.  He wants to buy a derelict oil container port on the East River and refurbish it so he can import more oil at a lower price.  This is an eminently sensible, legal, and unexciting business goal.   The writer-director J. C. Chandor wants to make a thriller about corruption and venality in the heating oil business of 1980s NYC, but it's all so vague it's hard to get worked up about people engaged in a fundamentally worthwhile business: warming homes in winter.  In the end Morales' wife saves the day with a deus ex machina: she has been \"skimming\" money off the company's books into a rainy day fund -- money that they can now use to buy the container port.  Abel is horrified at this accounting trickery.  Except, how is it a problem that a company saves money to achieve a legitimate business goal?  Maybe there's some kind of tax issue.  Who knows, the film never follows up on the issue and anyway in the very next scene Abel tells his wife \"You know what, let's use that cash.\"  So much for moral dilemma.\r Great style, limited substance."

      "text": "A misleading title, but overall a good story with some setting we seldom see. Carrying the weight of a potentially heavy movie is Oscar Isaac, who credibly portrays a rising tycoon (although he pretty much makes one facial expression the whole movie).\rIn an editing sense, the movie is made at the same pace it would have been if this were really 1981, convincing only at times and having some scenes drag out a bit more than they should. In a writing sense, it faults somewhere, with Abel's moral dilemma being unrealistically naive and a preposterous number of \"I know\"s in the script. Some other things are pushed as well: the Jewish business, for instance, and the \"nice\" bankers and police. However, the grey and wintry New York background helps establish a feeling of uneasiness and anxiety throughout, probably reflecting Abel's preoccupations.\r Maybe the plot could do with some more covering, because at times it introduces elements and never concludes them (for instance the iffy role of Abel's lawyer). But, as far as the rest goes (cinematography, story, acting, etc.) A Most Violent Year is a good film. Not a must-watch, but still in the 90 percentile of 2014 as far as big releases went."

The lead male character, whose moral calculations drive the plot, is neither charismatic, nor convincingly noble. I never rooted for him; I never cared.

This is as close as I've ever seen to a movie where nothing happens. Imagine your favorite gangster movie, then take out all the funny and interesting parts. That's \"A Most Violent Year.\" There is simply nothing here to care about.\r I went with a friend who really wanted to see the movie and asked me to go with him.

Skillfully written and ably directed by J.C. Chandor (\"All is Lost\", \"Margin Call\") with extraordinary photography by Bradford Young (\"Selma\"), and aided by the supporting talents of Albert Brooks and David Oyelowo, the film captures the true essence and the very heart of the City. Having been born near and totally familiar with the area where the story takes place, I can attest to how well the film captures the mood and feel of the Metropolis  and the life New Yorkers experienced at that time. It is always exciting to view a film where the writer/director, although one and the same, is able to succeed so well in both capacities. I give the film a 9 rating with special kudos to Mr. Isaac who, reminding the viewer of a younger Al Pacino, gives a most effective performance in this most enjoyable film."

Like this director's last film, it skillfully masquerades by tone and camera work as something more rich and more important than it is.  There's nothing much here.  The plot is derivative of so many other mob and crime movies but with much lower stakes.  This is a glorified student film made by someone who is stealing from past great films rather than portraying any kind of real experience and it shows all the way.\rThe lead actor does his best Al Pacino and comes up short.  He looks like him, probably how he got his career, and sounds like him when he raises his voice.  What he misses is the original power and authority.  Chastain does an accent and a type a hundred other actresses have tread over before and it's the same old same old.  This film is a prime example of the boredom of watching actors act in a half baked scenario by a director fudging it as some kind of auteur unsuccessfully spinning much out of nothing at all."

It is a crime drama with a lot of class but, in my opinion, not enough bang. The protagonist of the movie, Abel Morales , runs heating oil business in NYC in the 80's. It's a very competitive trade with a lot of violence. Abel is a very ambitious person trying to become a man that he could not be in his native country. His wife is a daughter of a mafioso but Abel rejects a violent approach to conducting his business even at extremely challenging times. This movie is about what it takes to stay in a competitive business, it's about pride, corruption, pursuing one's dream but most of all, it's about NYC in the 80's.\r All aspects of movie making are done very professionally.

Mostly this is due to actors making the best of the material and decent cinematography.\r Quite simply, this was not a story worth telling. The film is painfully slow and drawn out (one of the worst things you can say about a film is that it seemed much longer than it actually was) with very little action and, well, violence. That would all be fine if the plot was compelling in other ways, but it just isn't. The stakes are low, the characters are dry and one-dimensional, and there isn't much for the audience to actually care about or root for. Should we really care if some guy closes a deal on a piece of waterfront property to expand his heating oil business in 1981?\r Ultimately, the film mostly consists of Oscar Isaac sulking around, having conversations, and making uncomfortably-long eye contact with various people.\r Don't be fooled by the critical reception. This is apparently one of those films that critics will themselves to like, but which will leave most viewers perplexed by the praise."

From the establishing shot, the first is entirely captivating and truly ropes you in as you become invested in the going's on of the characters. Interestingly, it feels like a gangster film with the way it is shot and the way in which things occur, even though it is not, which I believe to be intentional due to the way the characters toe that line throughout. The film is gorgeously shot, as anticipated. Truly, it has to be one of the most beautiful films I have watched recently and one of the best examples of cinematography this decade. Honestly, it is ravishing. The acting equals the brilliance of the camera work as well, thanks to stellar performances from Oscar Isaac, Jessica Chastain, David Oyelowo, and the rest of the cast. If Isaac does not become recognized as one of the best actors of this generation soon, I may cry. The same goes for director J.C. Chandor who has to be one of the best directors working right now. Following up top-notch films in Margin Call and All Is Lost with this flick is impeccable. I am eagerly anticipating what he puts together next and he certainly is a talent that is demanding to be focused on. One of the top films of 2014, A Most Violent Year flew painfully under-the-radar and demands to be watched."

Set in 1981 a year, apparently, where more crime was committed in New York City than at any other time, it is an intelligently written drama that is both thrilling and dazzlingly acted. Oscar Isaac is fast becoming the most exciting and versatile actor currently on screen and I\u2019m sure that other people have noticed the similarities he bears to Al Pacino. He would certainly have been a great actor to have had around in the 70\u2019s, still the most exciting decade for films. Likewise Jessica Chastain, still flying under the radar despite 2 Oscar nominations and countless films to her credit, is at her powerful best here. She may not have as much screen time as Isaac, but she makes every second count in her bid to be \u2018deadlier than the male\u2019. Bleak cinematography, low key music and unobtrusive, but firm, direction from J C Chandor contribute to a film of deceptively raw power.

Abel Morales' reluctance to engage in criminal behaviour complicates his position, as he attempts to adapt his own moral code to the looser morals of all those around him, from the DA, to his wife, to his competitors in business. Oscar Isaac's calm and quiet portrayal of this sombre character is compelling, especially when he finds himself arguing with his much more temperamental wife, played beautifully by Jessica Chastain.  The quiet constancy of Isaac's character means that when his temper flares, it's that much more intense to watch.

The plot had the potential to become very slow, but the captivating performance of Oscar Isaac really kept the film going. If you were a fan of Oscar Isaac's performance in \"Inside Llewyn Davis\", you will likely enjoy this as well, but if you were not a fan, you will likely get bored."

      "text": "It has the atmospheric quality and incisive dialogue of a Godfather movie, but cleverly avoids falling into that familiar territory by subverting the gangster film genre entirely- this a film in which the protagonist has integrity, and is both incorruptible and determined to see his efforts in the local oil industry come to fruition, all the while intent on being an upstanding citizen. Director J.C. Candor masterfully depicts the struggle between either doing things lawfully, albeit with more difficultly, or succumbing to corruption with ease. The film ultimately suffers from some narrative issues, and director Candor seems ill-suited to deliver the final punch that the movie necessitates after its somewhat lethargic pacing, but overall it is an enthralling, well-acted piece of cinema."

      "text": "It's dark, slow paced, and gorgeously shot. Oscar Isaac does very well in this movie and so does Jessica Chastain. Cinematography was great. The script was great. This movie makes you think about life in, statistically, one of the most violent and crime ridden years in the United States. It's dark, and unforgiving. It's somewhat depressing, and if you're looking for a movie with action, drama, and a thrill ride, look somewhere else. Although, if you are looking for a movie with a story that gives you a thought to ponder on, with great acting, great cinematography, albeit with a relatively slow pace, then this is the movie for you."

      "text": "Led by a typically committed performance from Oscar Isaac, A Most Violent Year is a dark, gritty crime drama, and one of 2014's best films. Isaac continues to establish himself as one of his generation's finest actors, and Jessica Chastain and Albert Brooks shine in their supporting roles. JC Chandor directs the film exceptionally, and while some may find the pacing too slow, it's well-worth watching for those who liked Chandor's previous films and are fans of Isaac and Chastain. Overall, A Most Violent Year is a great film with superb performances, great writing and expert direction. A most remarkable film."
