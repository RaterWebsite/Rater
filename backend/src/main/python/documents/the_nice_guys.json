Now I am wide awake and unable to fall asleep. 10/10 will watch this movie again!\r On a more serious note, I really like how they have used physical comedy and used the framing of shots to create funny scenes. It somewhat reminded me of the tropes Wes Anderson uses in his comedies although The Nice Guys is far less refined and subtle. Still, this movie has surprised me in a very positive manner!"

So I went to look for the full details and I thought I'll end up as another silly comedy like 'Daddy's Home'. That's why I did not bother to check it out its teaser and trailer, but now I feel terrible for my crappy judgement. Because this was an awesome movie, definitely not just in the comedy category, but overall one of the best films of the year and it should be in everybody's top ten or twenty and nothing less.\r It is a retro type film that takes place in the late 70s, LA. Where two private investigators unlikely come together to probe a mysteriously reappeared porn star from the dead as what her aunt says. But later that connects with another high profile missing girl case and so with all the leads, these two goes the length risking their lives to solve it. The remaining story reveals whether they succeed or end up as the losers.\r It was from the director of 'Iron Man 3' who wrote it keeping in mind as a television series, but later turned into this beautiful comedy. The first thing is I loved the Ryan and Russell's performances. They totally nailed it, especially Ryan Gosling in many comedy scenes. I think I laughed a lot and better after a long time. That's a surprise, you know, I did not think they can do comedies, but they're beyond all the praising words.\r It's not just two of them, there is a mini 'Nancy Drew Reporter' kind of character. A teen girl joins them in the investigation and her part as well had a great impact on the narration. You would think you can predict the story, but it is a well written screenplay with many twists. Everybody did their job so well, even the two hours did not look too long, but went very quick. The cast, crew, production, all must return for a sequel and I hope it will happen very soon. A must see film, but for the grown ups only.\r 8/10"

The performances from Gosling, Rice and Crowe are exceptional, the storyline is throroughly entertaining (albeit ridiculous), and the script is expertly crafted, witty and hilarious. The costuming and design aesthetic evoke the heady opulence and garishness of the era perfectly, though if you've seen the trailer, some of the best moments are somewhat dulled by the expectation of the next comedic scene. I was somewhat disappointed by the lack of commentary on the objectification of the era, but in general this is a polished, enjoyable film, that doesn't take itself at all seriously. 8.02/10"

      "text": "\"The Nice Guys\", An Inmediate Classic Comedy\r Irrefutably, \"The Nice Guys\" reigns compared to R-rated comedy films of this year (with the exception of \"Deadpool\"); with the personal obsessions of its director/scriptwriter, narrative intelligence and heart of those buddy comedies of the 80s, Black resumes the power in a suspense/action comedy movie rich in good performances and argumentative ability, in addition to a fascinating travel across time. Despite not having a vast repertoire of works, Shane Black established the odd couples of rough guys in the films, those which possessed a terrible relationship in daily life, but that in the violent and full of action sequences show their good hearts. After his latest project in 2005, \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\", Black writes - together with Anthony Bagarozzi - and directs what could become in the best of his career.\r The film would survive of independent way, without the need to its extreme action and violent scenes thanks to the incredible chemical of its leads, certainly, they are erected as an of the funniest duos in the film world. Black and Bagarozzi transport us back to the glorious 1980s, epoch where lechery, endless party and the psychedelic pornography were booming. Ryan Gosling plays Holland March, a dishonest and unprofessional private eye who immerses himself into an alcoholic whirlwind to forget the death of his wife while trying to educate and raise in a peculiar way his teenage daughter. On the other hand, Russell Crowe plays Jackson Healy, an unorthodox hired enforcer , he does not matter to work for the most indelible person in the world, provided that you collect a acceptable amount of money, he will work for you, complacently. Angourie Rice gets the same prominence than the main duo, she is Holly March, daughter of March and assistant of the couple of private detectives, unconsciously, a girl as charismatic as intelligent, who gains one place almost immediately in the frantic and demanding Hollywood by herself. The funny and hilarious trio will be challenged to solve four cases that ravage the City of Los Angeles: the death of a porn star, the disappearance of a young woman, a criminal conspiracy of high standards and the disappearance of a man from his funeral.\r The plot is a genuine and vile MacGuffin, a trick designed by the selfsame Alfred Hitchcock, who permeated each suspense work of his authorship with this clever strategy. The film borrows several references to the \"The Big Lebowski\" classic, considering that it employs each alleged main plot to take us to the true final storyline, some indecorous and dangerous car manufacturers utilize of camouflage the disappearance of a young girl and the death of the porn star to give one message of singular form; nonetheless, Gosling and Crowe involves us in the complex scheme as themselves.\r \"The Nice Guys\" is a perfect coordinate mechanism, it not is based only in the sequences of shootings, explosions and fights (which have recreated of lucid and entertaining way, perhaps, Marvel instilled in Black this ability after the success in \"Iron Man 3\"), the movie combines with dialogs full of jokes, powerful dialogs, clap-worthy dialogs, besides certain nostalgia by the films of the 80s. Although the film did not expect such reception at the box office, was not created for this objective, it is a movie with fundaments and totally faithful to the old buddy movies, is not a commercial product, although it seems like, it is a project that deserves the name of \"film\", in capital letters.\r Shane Black earns good marks in a genre that is quickly becoming in monotonous and without surprises. An intricate plot, an extravagant atmosphere, a explosive soundtrack and an ingenious chemical of its leading actors are complemented by a absorbent pace and a nostalgic tone eighties. If you like to enjoy of one action movie, watch \"The Nice Guys\", if you like to enjoy of one comedy movie, watch \"The Nice Guys\", if you like to rekindle the 80s, watch \"The Nice Guys\", if you want to experience the best film of comedy of the year, watch \"The Nice Guys\"."

      "text": "Shane Black directs what is, in effect, a rephrasing of his earlier film 'Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang'Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling star as two mis-matched guys with a de rigeur 'dark past' who become embroiled in a search for the daughter of the head of the Department of Justice, and her involvement in a porn film which has caused everyone else involved in it to wind up dead.Set in the hedonistic days of 1977, in an eternally Sunny Los Angeles, the film moves along at a reasonable pace, and the set pieces all work well in giving the audience enough information to understand, but not feeling the need to force huge amounts of exposition so as to spell it all out.Crowe and Gosling have undeniable chemistry, the script is tight, and the young Angourie Rice steals every scene she's in as Gosling's 13 year old daughter.Throw in a fantastic pseudo 70's musical score, and enough disco/funk hits to create a very listenable to on its own soundtrack, and you've got an excellent adult-themed, buddy comedy movie.So, what's not so good? Well, the movie does dispense with a lot of the 'nastier' elements of the world of Los Angeles at that time. With scenes at what are effectively sex parties, there's some nudity, but no actual sex going on, nor are there any piles of cocaine being snorted! Add to that a very sterile environment (something that bugs me in pretty much any film set in the past), where every car is pristine and beautifully clean and waxed, everyone is coiffured and immaculately turned out.So, worth watching? Definitely! Just take it as what it is, a fun, profane movie with a twist here and there and a hint that there might be a sequel just before the end credits roll."

      "text": "\"The Nice Guys had a similar tone to what I was looking for in \"Keanu\". It has a premise that appears serious but the protagonists are more invested in their personal stories than in the grand conspiracy. Russel Crowe is back and his performance marks a nice return from the esteemed Australian star.  His interactions with Ryan Gosling. They are similar in the fact they have a troubled past and try to live up to their job as police officers but they are troubled. The main difference between the two is that Crowe is an activist and Gosling is more of a fatalist. The main difference in how they approach the situation makes an entertaining watch. The interaction between the two give rise to some comedic antiques with Russel Crowe acting as a comic foil with his high brow masculinity being countered by Ryan Gosling's outlandish personality.  Gosling's daughter in the film could have been a burden but she was written in a way that makes her a huge contribute to the story. In fact she helps out Ryan Gosling more than Russel Crowe does in certain cases. It is clear that she loves her father but she doesn't want him to waste his life being a alcoholic as well. She also has a touching relationship with Russel Crowe. The only problem with said relationship is that there was a subplot of Gosling's daughter not wanting Corwe t kill which felt a little out of place considering that her father had shot a few gangsters in the film prior to that. Some might take issue with the representation of grown women in this film. It does match the setting of the 1970s but there are a few instances when it could feel uncomfortable like how the intro kills off a porn star right after sexualising her. The story line also has a lack of focus but to the films credit it knows that the highlight is the interactions with the characters so it doesn't try to develop it as much. I also give the film some credit for killing off the woman that they were trying to protect which is something that most buddy-cop movies usually wouldn't do. Even when they expose her mother for plotting the assassination she still gets away Scott free. That is something that is usually not done in these kind of comedies and I respect the director's decision to include this in the film. The film does fall under cop comedy cliches from time to time and the story is not as well structured as it could have been but it is a fun ride for anyone who wishes to see this film. You will be entertained in this wild ride."

Films such as \"Lethal Weapon\", \"The Last Boy Scout\" and \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\" all have that same vibe of being humurous but inteligent at the same time. The Nice Guys has that vibe too. The plot was very tortuos to the film where there was whole bunch of twists and turns during it's three acts of fine glory. Shane Black managed to use them in a way where the audience is invested in the situation and wanting to know what will unfold in the next gripping scene as they unexpectedly appear. In addition, the chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe was phenomenal. They provided us with a combination of sarcasm and witticisms that had me uncontrollably laughing.

Hysterical from beginning to end, The Nice Guys is not simply hollow laughs, but matches it comedic instincts with a well-constructed plot that keeps you consistently engaged and not just hanging on waiting for the next joke. Well paced and well-crafted, The Nice Guys has incredibly multi-dimensional characters and the film as a whole really pays homage to a bygone era, especially in Los Angeles. I am an absolute sucker for these neo-noir films set in Los Angeles, especially ones with fantastic cinematography and The Nice Guys most certainly fits the bill. Undoubtedly set to go down as one of the funniest films of 2016, The Nice Guys is not just some brain dead comedy. Rather, it makes you think and has a true emotional core that really threatens to start up the waterworks. Overall, The Nice Guys is an absolute winner."

      "text": "\"Look on the bright side, nobody got hurt.\"\r Breaking through the door of the already crowded room that is that of police dramas, The Nice Guys brings an innovative mix of comedy,  tension and sheer absurdity.\r Director Shane Black's last work stands out for it's brilliant dialogues, surreal recourse to slapstick humor and general depiction of death, and a new way of representing the development of relationships between characters, breaking the bilateral paradigm that we have seen maybe one too many times in recent cinematic history: on one side we have the corny mix of an effective character that always gets the job done and an inept, unpractical character that seems more like a hassle than an actual aid, but who in the end discovers his potential and fundamentally helps in solving the main problem; on the other side, we have a team of equally able individuals who all use their traits in an overly serious way, only to end up meeting their match in the antagonist and having to step up their game. The Nice Guys, on the other hand, depicts a situation in which all of the characters, in the solving of the dilemma, end up living with their ups and downs, never ending in a pathetic internal debate that would stop the movie dead in it's tracks. They always move on and never try and change their way of action, and they make the best, or the least worst, out of it. This makes the characters keep themselves, and keep focus on the actual task at hand, even in the moments in which the film gives some more details on the lives of our to unconventional heroes.\r This, along with the constant undertone of ridiculousness, expressed by the over-the-top references to sex (and more specifically to pornography, which plays a fundamental role in the plot), the constant, seemingly random deaths and acts of violence, scattered throughout the movie at any possible chance, makes \"The Nice Guys\" a brilliant addition to the list of \"best films of 2016\"."

      "text": "The comic teaming of these stars was promising, and they do make a good team.  Too bad it's utterly wasted in this overly convoluted, highly formulaic, bloated, not very funny but crass movie!  All you need of this junk is to watch the free trailer which has the funniest bits.  The couple funny scenes are also out there for publicity.  Sitting through the actual feature is an excruciating bore.\rIt doesn't help that it's full of annoying period flaws.  Set in 1977, and at least 2 big songs featured weren't even released until 1-2 years later, \"Jaws 2\" came out in June 1978 (highly doubtful that billboard poster was even created at least 7 months earlier much less already advertising on the Sunset Strip), the Camaro is from 1979 or later, Tim Allen hadn't even started his stand-up career yet, platter projection systems were doubtfully in use at the time much less even invented yet?, and certain vulgar phraseology spoken was not part of the lexicon yet.\rThe point is for an expensive major film (any film for that matter, because omission works wonders), it's a disgrace the director is so sloppily incompetent not to get this kind of stuff right no matter how unimportant the people who made this think such detail is, certainly when all those very specific choices have hundreds of other options which would cost no more to have gone with!  Maybe if the script didn't suck so bad such anachronistic slop would be more forgivable? \u00a0No, not even then it isn't."

Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling made for one great on-screen pair and kept the film lively, fun, and just plain energetic from start to finish! Despite being a little all over the place at times, the film was also quick-witted and never had a dull moment! Overall, this is definitely a fun and also very funny film worth checking out!"

      "text": "I understand there are some guidelines for specific genres.If you are going to see a thriller-slash-comedy, do not expect too much logic, common sense, etc.\rEnjoy the bang, vulgar language and some humor. I would expect just that in a movie with (or from) people like Jonah Hill and would stay home, because it does not cut it for me.\rLow humor quality, lousy acting, silly script, all that. But when a movie stars Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe, one should expect (at list I did) a better quality.\rAnd indeed, in the beginning the movie was quite entertaining. But not for long. Decent acting from both leads and a few funny episodes did not save this almost 2-hour silly movie.\rSuch a waste of talents."

Russel Crowe and Ryan Gosling should be ashamed of themselves. I can only hope that the reason they accepted parts in this hideous film is that both of them have balloon mortgages coming due soon."

There were occasional funny lines, but those didn't compensate for the terrible choppy adolescent-level script, Russell Crowe's wooden acting, Ryan Gosling's awful Lou Costello impersonation, the third or fourth Ryan Gosling girl scream, Kim Basinger's TV-movie character, ridiculous misses by point blank machine gun fire, lame attempts at plot twists, creepy scenes in which kids were repeatedly inserted into situations that were way too adult for comfort (didn't think a 12 year old boy boasting about his penis was hilarious, and what's with the other kid who wasn't even mildly surprised to find a dead body in his back yard?), and an anticlimactic unsatisfying ending.   I was looking at my watch through the last 2/3 of the movie, and would have left if I wasn't with a big family group.  At one point I turned to my wife and said \"make it stop!.\""

I was enjoying this film from start to finish and to me, this is the best comedy duo that I have seen in years. It's so nice to see a movie like this. Shane Black, you sir deserve my respect for bringing a great film. And I will admit, this is one of my favorites by far."
