Yes, his name IS amalgamated with this film but luckily for us he is only producing the movie and not actually directing it. Does that fact help? Maybe yes, perhaps no. Either way I have mixed feelings about \"Devil\". It's neither frightening nor suspenseful but it does have an element of unpredictability which is appreciated. All in all It's nothing special but it does do It's intended job for what It's worth."

Night Shyamalan.\r Wait...no, no I'm not...\r Despite only filling the producer/writer role, Shyamalan's continued floundering seeps into every corner of this film.\r While Devil's premise is interesting its execution is incredibly flawed thanks to twists that can be seen from miles away, unbelievable and down right moronic events and circumstances setting up these twists, and a complete lack of any kind of suspenseful build up. For a movie that was supposed to be thrilling and unsettling Devil falls flat on its face."

The acting isn't very good, and the characters are rather generic: overly-serious black guy, crazy old lady, a**hole businessman, and boring guy and girl. Many plot points are so silly that they are unintentionally funny. Apparently, you know the devil is near if a child hits his head on the table when he falls, and suicide notes are either completely insane or completely rational, never both. I think I liked this movie because it's sort of a modern version of Agatha Christie's \"And Then There Were None\" which is one of my all-time favorite novels. I recommend it if you can get past the sillier plot points."

The idea, people dying inside an elevator, is amazing and I'll admit that it's the idea that has inspired me to watch the movie. But, except that good idea - there's absolutely nothing, except maybe the atmosphere but that's mostly irrelevant. The acting is actually quite bad, the plot itself is more comical than frightening and I actually watched the movie hoping for a scary moment until the credits started rolling. I was bitterly disappointed. All the elements of a bad horror movie have been implemented here, even mocked in some strange way, but the movie is not even close to a parody. If you enjoy a creative idea to stimulate your deductive mind, you can give the movie a try and look at the elevator as a puzzle, but beside that, it offers absolutely nothing and I do not recommend it for watching."

Going into a Shyamalan movie, you know you're going to see a tragedy, a hero, and an amazing twist at the end. Coming off two absolute bombs, Shyamalan needed a good film to get back on track, and Devil is it! This is one of those movies that's hard to describe without giving stuff away, so let me just say, it's Shyamalan at his best! It's a great story, a young unknown cast, and the ending will just blow your mind. Unlike most Horror/Thriller writers, Shyamalan doesn't use gore to shock you, but rather has a story that will just scare you to your core, and by the end of this one I was rattled! This is a top notch film that fell way under the radar, because of its unknown cast, but if you like scary movies or edge of your seat thrillers, you have to see this film!"

      "text": "I just need to say this first. After M. Night's horrific move on making The Last Airbender, I thought NOTHING would redeem him for it.  This movie barely does it. Since he actually direct this movie, he still has a way to go to earn the respect of the average moviegoer. This movie was actually pretty intense. Director John Eric Dowdle (Quarantine and The Poughkeepsie Tapes) seems to know what he's doing when it comes to thriller/suspense movies. The movie often does the movie trick to completely shut off the picture to take us into the darkness of being trapped inside a small space like an elevator, which I found to be a good thing.  I especially like the concept of the story, in which the Devil comes to Earth in human form and when that happens, everything is ends up going bad. One way they make that assumption was when the religious security guard tosses his toast with jelly in the air and it lands jelly side down....a useful test to see if the Devil is here.  Another thing I liked about this movie is the cast itself. Each person trapped is very different and you may believe anyone of them is the one behind it. The thing that I did find a tad annoying was the acting of Logan Marshall-Green, one of the trapped. His acting was a bit off in my taste, but it's nothing that would distract you from the rest of the movie.  I'm not going to reveal who the \"Devil\" is, but me personally, I had a guess and I was right.  The twist on who is the devil may be obvious to some, but the overall twist kinda catches you off guard."

The movie is VERY VERY interesting with a sense of creepiness that is abundant in the movie, it scared the living crap out of me. It was an extremely enjoyable creep fest about murder mystery, paranoia, fear and anxiety. The movie has that feeling of anxiety, the fact that you're in a small space with a killer is not quite settling.

It keeps things fresh by feeling like a classic whodunnit with a supernatural twist or a good episode of \"The Twilight Zone.\"  Since Shyamalan didn't actually pen the script (he's the mind behind the story, but the screenplay was handled by a different party) or direct the film, it lacks the subtle tension common in most of his other productions; opting for more jump scares than edge of your seat suspense.  Plot development and themes, however, are very Shyamalan-esque.  When all the pieces fall into place, it's a nicely executed revelation."

Screenplay is based on a story by M. Night Shyamalan, director of \"Sixth Sense\" among other films. In fact, the concept idea is good, intriguing and succeeds in grabbing the public attention, having been decently developed in the script. \"Who will be the next victim?\", \"who is the devil?\"... these two questions are the skeleton of the film from a given moment and this makes everything more predictable from then on because they're limited to a set of options and conclusions. The film is too fast and doesn't have a very good pace. We cannot appreciate the suspense when everything is happening so quickly. The actors' work was decent enough, particularly Chris Messina, but most of the characters weren't particularly good. Jacob Vargas, in particular, played a Latin with strongly stereotyped and absurd characteristics. Cinematography is good, visual and sound effects were well used to densify the environment at the exact moments. The film has quality. However, it lacks some unpredictability and a deeper story, with stronger characters."

The Empiricists see the problem; they scoff at the procedural metaphysics that is practiced by the Intuitionists, men and women with hunches who divine the problem. Lila Mae Watson, the first black elevator inspector in the history of the Guild is an Intuitionist; she uses a faith-based approach on each inspection job. Intuitionists just know. But then Lila Mae's kind come under fire when an elevator car she oversaw on a routine inspection, suffers a complete malfunction, plummeting to the ground, which calls the Intuitionists' methodology into question. As it turns out, Lila Mae was a victim of sabotage, perpetuated by the Empiricists, who rigged the fall. G. Carson is the elevator inspector in \"Devil\", a film with a world that's topsy-turvy in its own right. The vertically-challenged opening shots of the upside-down metropolis has an estranging effect on the moviegoer, because it reallocates heaven and hell from their normal points of reference: north and south. So what does it mean when Gehenna finds itself aloft in an emblematic sky, while a reconstituted Canaan is lowered from the celestial sphere, occupying where the ground used to be? Well, if Gabriel and his gang of rowdy angels can kick ass in Scott Stewart's \"Legion\", why can't the devil sport an altruistic side and do God's work for a change? \"Devil\" inverts The Rolling Stones' song \"Sympathy for the Devil\" through its originative characterization of an archfiend who has sympathy for the human condition. Taking the form of an old woman, the devil works in ways more mysterious to God; she's a one-demon advocacy group: D.A.D.D.(Devil Against Drunk Driving). The devil cares. Like the Colson Whitehead novel, \"Devil\" has its own intuitionists and empiricists in a holding pattern of ideological discord. When a ghostly image superimposes itself upon the elevator passengers in the security camera monitor, Ramirez(Jacob Vargas), the intuitionist(read: ecclesiasticist in the Whitehead novel), has a gut reaction; that video disturbance, his gut tells him, is the devil, whereas Lustiq(Matt Craven), the empiricist(read: atheist), dismisses his partner's spiritual notions outrightly. Bowden(Chris Messina), the detective in charge of the ongoing crime scene, is also an empiricist, but with a difference; he believes that man is the devil, after a mortal demon left his wife and child at the scene of a vehicular homicide. He becomes an intuitionist after the devil reveals herself, and forces the drunk driver(Logan Marshall-Green) to repent. Afterward, in the squad car, Bowden tells Tony who he is, and forgives the man for what he'd done to his life. The devil made him do it. That's pretty subversive stuff. God is nowhere on the scene. G. Carson(COL-son) is no longer in the elevator inspection business. What if \"G\" stands for God?"

Devil is about five people stuck in an elevator, with one of them being the Devil. The people in the elevator are Jenny O' Hara (Extract), Bojana Novakovic (Edge Of Darkness), Geoffery Arend (500 Days of Summer), Bokeem Woodbine (Ray), and Logan Marshall-Green (Brooklyn's Finest). Chris Messina (Greenberg) plays a detective trying to piece together which one of these people is the Devil. Devil starts out slow, but the effects, the plot, and the acting piece together a decent supernatural-horror flick. The thing that I like best about this movie, is the twist ending. Overall, the movie rarely scared movie. However, the one person that turns out to be the Devil, and the way that person looked at the camera nearly made me pass out. Also, they all have a little dirt on them, so you can't tell which one is the Devil. For example. Hara's character is a robber, Novakovic likes to marry the rich, and leave them with their money, Arend's character is one of the main causes for the economy, Woodbine's character is a thug, and Green's character is just plain weird, carrying a satchel with pliers, scissors, and more creepy stuff, and doesn't take them with him on the elevator. I expected this movie to actually be funny. However, it's my favorite horror film since The Crazies. However, the beginning starts out slow, but I got into it after 20 minutes. Devil ends with the quote \"If there's a devil, there has to be a god.\" Hopefully, when I fall asleep tonight, there will be a guardian angel with a dream catcher right next to my bed, so I don't get nightmares.
