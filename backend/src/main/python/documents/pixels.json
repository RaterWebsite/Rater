He's lazy, boring, and needs to leave hollywood now. Horrible casting choices (Kevin James has no place as the President in any universe), terrible plot considering the concept, and an overall disgrace to video games. Worst film I've seen in 2015 without any doubt in my mind."

While the basic premise of the movie is a good one, Sony and Happy Madison's take on the material is laughless and insufferably dull. In the end, you'd be better off spending your quarters at an actual retro arcade."

I took my 3 children, 13, 5, and 3 and they were all extremely entertained.  I too thought the movie was pretty damned funny.  There were very few moments when I was not laughing.  It was an original and entertaining story with plenty of laughs and action.  Adam Sadler, Kevin James, and Josh Gad were all funny, and I usually do not find Kevin James tolerable, and Peter Dinklage is absolutely hilarious.  In closing I thought it was an all around enjoyable movie and, to be honest, the best of the summer blockbusters so far."

There were a couple times I laughed, The whole video games attacking earth was entertaining and the video game battle sequences were well done and for once Hollywood produced an original movie. OK that's it for the positives. Even though I laughed at a couple parts it was a pretty big mess from start to finish. The actin was mediocre, the script was bland and the whole idea of using women as trophies when they saved the world. BELCH. I watched this movie because I love old school aracde games and even though Adam sandler does not make good movies nowadays he has had a couple of good ones such as 50 first dates, bedtime stories, billy Madison blended and a few others. However his acting felt very flat and so did the rest of the cast. Predictable with a few entertaining movies does not save this movie from the mess it really is. Now I just need to ease the memory of seeing pixels from my head."

The cinematography and special effects look like they were made with a free to download 3D maker software from a high school team class project! The acting is so poor that even Buzz Lightyear and Woody from Pixar's Toy Story have more EMOTION than Adam Sadler and the rest of the casting crew. The movie makes a decent try to reference the 80's through old time songs and even having a character dressed with jeans, spiky hair and ear rings similarly to the 80's fashion but the results end making him a parody (and no he was not meant to be a parody he was meant to be a cultural reference and they failed miserably on that).\rThe game fails to deliver any nostalgia regarding videogames of the 80's era. They even put cheating a videogame as a turning point to twist the plot!! No serious videogamer takes cheating or jokes about hacking a videogame lightly and it is definitely not appreciated!\rSave yourselves and do not watch that movie.\rTo whom it may be like-able?

      "text": "Video games really don't have a good reputation when it comes to having film adaptations. Sure we have a few good one's like Wreck it Wralph or Scott Pilgrim, but for the most part they seem to go down the same route as the Super Mario Bros movie where the film loses all the charm that made the game enjoyable to begin with. Part of the reason for this is they always seem to be put into dreadful hands. This time those dreadful hands are Happy Madison Productions, Sandler's film studio that have been producing his cinematic turds for 15 years now. And once again they have produced another insulting comedy, lacking any real charm and being light on laughs.\r The plot unfolds because back in the 80's NASA sent several video games in to space to communicate to extraterrestrials. But their message of peace was misinterpreted as a declaration of war and the aliens send several video game characters to attack the earth. Thus President Cooper (Kevin James) recruits his childhood friend and gaming champion Brenner (Adam Sandler) to fight off the alien invasion.\r Right away we've really got to suspend disbelief to accept the plot. Not just because of having to accept the poorly explained justification of why the aliens are attacking as video games, but also buying Kevin James as president of the USA. It's never explained how he became President, but unless Donald Trump was the only other candidate there's no way he could've gotten voted into the position. Especially considering he plays the same annoying character he always does of the dumb guy who does nothing but hang out with Adam Sandlers character.\r None of the other characters are much better. Sandler has as much charisma as a plank of wood. Josh Gad's performance as the nerdy friend is annoying from the start. The only one who gets even a chuckle is Dinklage as the over the top douchey rival, but even that gets worn out quickly. Also just like all Sandler productions we get a lot of offensive stereotypes. This time the focus is on geek stereotypes, like gamers are antisocial weirdo's who have no lives and live in their mothers basement. Albeit this isn't the most offensive stereotype, but it's still insulting one of the film's biggest audiences.\r Besides this there are other typical offensive representations we see in all Sandler movies, like women being nothing more than eye candy. In fact there are only two female characters in lead roles. The first is Michelle Monaghan who's in the film only to give Sandlers character somebody to flirt with. The other is Ashley Benson who plays one of the video game characters who comes to life, who not only doesn't get a single line of dialogue in the film but also ends up being a literal trophy for one of the characters.\r Having some of gaming's most recognisable icons, you'd really think the film would actually do something good with them. But it doesn't. The gaming characters will just attack Sandler and co. only for the humans to fight back and that's it. It never tries to actually make any jokes with these characters, but instead does the same thing as a film like Disaster Movie where it will try to get a laugh by just naming something popular. The only video game icon they do anything else with is Q*bert, who is one of their trophies to help them. But all they have him do is typical annoying Sandler humour like watching Q*bert wet himself with pixels and some weak slapstick.\r Although at least the gaming icons they use actually look good. It's not like the Mario Bro's Movie where Goomba's looked like a pear on the body of Frankenstein and instead the 3d CGI models maintain the charm of the original designs. But to me this makes the film even worse than typical Sandler comedies because it ends up feeling like such wasted potential. Had a better production been given the chance to use these characters, we might have got a charming homage to video games. But instead we got a typical Sandler comedy, just as unfunny as always but with a bigger effects budget."

The dialog is simply uninspired and feels somewhat forced. The romance edge took up a lot of screen time and was not good at all. It should have been left out or less emphasized. The comedy was slapstick as always however it didnt connect very well in this movie. I did laugh about 3 or 4 times but it wasnt like some of the laughs I had in other comedies. The plot was non-nonsensical in that there was no adversary characterization except for a few words that Q-Bert made about his race.

      "text": "A great concept Sandlerized.  I really considered shutting this film off about thirty minutes in, but I held out a little hope for the video game characters.  The human characters were horribly written and horribly performed.  Sean Bean and Michelle Monaghan should fire their agents.  Seriously Kevin James as President of the United States makes the idea of Donald Trump look good.  I wouldn't spend a Quarter, a Dime, or a Penny to see this atrocity.  F"

Man, the movie was pretty cool despite the critics making some bad reviews about it. I mean, Donkey Kong, Pac-Man, Centipede and a whole lot of video game characters appearing in a war between the humans and the alien life-forms. I have to admit: You have to be a video game champion, but you cannot cheat. Best movie ever! :)"

These are the same pansies that use words like \"trigger\"  and \"privilege\"  and most important probably belong to a \"group\"  **** you and your group! Who the hell joins a group? bunch of losers. lol\r Martha and serena threesome tho would never enter my mind.. I still felt envious. Watch  for yourselves and don't listen the care bears."

      "text": "Extremely UNDERRATED film. Of course there are many MANY flaws, including over-the-top loudness, flat jokes, and a plot that didn't quite make sense, but this is really not worth an 58% audience score on rotten tomatoes. I really don't get the hatred for this movie and why people hat Adam Sandler. This is really fun to watch with the family. Many jokes were flat and you can tell when the joke was supposed to make you laugh, but instead there was silence among the audience, but really REALLY this film is better than Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.\rSaw this on Monday July 27 1:35 p.m. Digital\rLess than ten people in my theater"
