Kevin Hart acts excellently and conveys the emotions very well to the viewer. At the end it's a tearjerker with heartwarming moments that was worth to watch."

      "text": "Fatherhood is a much needed and appreciated film in an age of cynicism and lost faith. I applaud the courage of everyone who made this film especially given the perceived redundancy and disposability of fathers in society today. Kevin Hart gives the performance of a lifetime. Never underestimate a performer, especially one who was previously typecast into comedic roles as the butt of jokes, often due to his height. I strongly feel he should be a contender on the award circuit. Kevin gave a nuanced and powerful performance as a father dealing with unimaginable odds and overwhelming grief. You can relate to his journey as he goes through various stages of grief and acceptance, tempered with hope and heart, and above all the courage to change and listen. It may come as a shock to many, but fathers are capable of deep emotion and connection to their children as depicted in this film. Melody Hurd gives a stunning performance as a precocious and courageous child, willing to challenge herself and above all guide her father to grow. She shows a wisdom beyond her years and I expect great things from this talented little actress.As expected Alfre Woddard delivers a powerful and moving rendition of a grieving grandmother, tempered with her signature gravitas. Indeed the entire cast is excellent and really rounds out the movie, each playing their role as a set of hands holding up the grieving, overwhelmed father. The tragedy depicted in this film had particular poignance and relevance with me on a personal level as I had a brush with a similar incident just recently in my life. I remember all too well those fateful days when as a father I felt crushed with the magnitude of responsibility before me, but the Mercy of God delivered. Fatherhood is an essential film and strongly recommended viewing. A good parent is a good parent, period. And a good parent shows courage and determination beyond the expectations of everyone else, even themselves."

HE IS NOT FUNNY AT ALL. and when u try to ask him to do a serious drama, it's horrible. trying to be pathetic funny is excruciating.moreover the script and storyline is so dated. the new 'girl'looked so ugly and like a giant beside the minute hart. the only character worth watching is the cute daughter. but her cute smirk can only last so long. can't wait for the show to finish just to tick off our to do list in our bored lockdown existense."

      "text": "Kevin Hart dials back his typical fast-talking manic personality for a chance at drama (plus some lite comedy). His character\u2019s wife dies shortly after their baby is born and he faces life as a single father. The film is front-loaded with tragedy, but brightens up after a while. Most of the comic moments are wisely assigned to supporting cast members, leaving Hart as the straight man. While the story follows a familiar trajectory, it\u2019s made more enjoyable by Hart\u2019s sensitive performance, along with the always-wonderful Alfre Woodard (as the unsure mother in law) and cute, charming Melody Hurd (as the daughter). Overall, it\u2019s a sweet little family drama with Hart doing a commendable job."

I related to this movie a lot (almost, at least) so I cried more than I ever had during any move, except for maybe Flight of the Navigator. Kevin Hart did a great job as a serious actor. I didn't think he had it in him but he does."

Kevin Hart performed the character of a single young parent very well.  We have seen him doing comedy but he just rocked the character of an emotional parent who is concerned about her daughter's life and he is trying hard to balance both his professional life and family life.I enjoyed the chemistry between father and daughter. There wasn't anything surprising in this movie. It didn't capture my attention but it was indeed a sweet story."

      "text": "This movie should have been titled, \"Retread\" or, \"A Thief of Time.\"   There was absolutely nothing original about this. To say it was boring would be doing this film an injustice. It was the next level REM sleep tedium - to the nth degree. Half way through the movie I was rooting for the nun. How did this get the green light to be made? There should have been a disclaimer at the beginning of this movie, \"This film contains no novel ideas or thoughts - watch at your own discretion.\" If there is any sequel made of this movie I'm going to kill myself and move to France - that's how bad this movie was. I'm going to do it in that order. What was the screenwriter thinking? Let's play it so safe we'll put everyone to sleep, including all insomniacs. Just when you thought it was safe to go back to the movies, something like this comes along and you wish the pandemic was followed by a plague. Let's all agree, the next time a movie is made, it should have a point and not just rehash every other \"single-parent\" movie that's ever been made. As Americans we deserve better than this."

Another moment sees Matt and Maddy have heart to Hart (sorry) conversations. It's not really comedy-drama, more like drama, then comedy, and drama again."
