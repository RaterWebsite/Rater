      "text": "Its not going to win any awards, but if you are looking for a fun family film that covers the true story of Christmas in a fun way then you will love this movie.  While it throws biblical accuracy out the window, its still fun and enjoyable.  I would recommend for Children up to age 12.The animation on this film is excellent and really surprising for what was certainly not a big budget animation film."

      "text": "Nice enough story, but not believable. Good cast makes the dialogue sing, but again, just not a believable story in today's world. I like that Oprah is in  it because she is so great and cool. I used to have an Oprah wig and I would wear it around the house and I'd hold a spatula like a microphone and I'd be just telling people how to live their lives and occasionally I'd re-enact Stedman and Oprah's wedding night complete with the oversized gourds and vibrating egg."

      "text": "It stinks! would say Jay Sherman if he was real. The Star is every tipical classic animated film with the formula of \"Take place in an importannt event of the past\" whit \"What really happen\" whit annoying talking animals. That goes whit most of the characters that are a cast of unfunny and unintresting characters, whit an boring plot and unfunny humor and animal slapstick. Sure, the animation and voice acting isn't bad, but it still not enough to say is your tipical movie cartoon whit animals. I'm not a religious person but if i was, i would stay hate this movie. There's no reason to nominee this to the Golden Globes or even for Best Song. And there's no way that Sony can make more money."

      "text": "Not surprising that this would get lambasted by critics - anything that attempts to portray events in the Bible without subverting it somehow is never going to get a fair shake.But this movie surprisingly does just that - in 2017, we have a theatrical release of a movie that does a fairly decent job of retelling the birth of Christ, through the eyes of the donkey Boaz who longs to be part of the royal caravan.  Many of the events are expanded on/fictionalized/time-compressed, but overall it stays true to the Christmas story. Themes of friendship, faith, and redemption are all present in spades. Both traditional and non-traditional Christmas songs are peppered throughout, and for the most part are well done.There are a couple of poop jokes that feel very out of place given the subject matter, but that sort of thing seems to be written in the contract of all kids movies these days. The main antagonist is pretty scary, and (IIRC) he dies at the end, so keep that in mind when bringing young children.  But my 5 and 8 year old enjoyed it very much; they saw it twice - once as a free pre-release screening (full disclosure), then again once it was in the theaters. It's not destined to be a seasonal classic, but for those who are looking for a modern movie that aims to tell the actual story of the holiday rather than some nebulous \"spirit of Christmas\" schlock, this is pretty good."

This potentially powerful story should not have had its focus on the animals, no one gave a **** about them, and every time the film was getting interesting with the human characters, it cut to the animals doing stupid **** This is one pile of animal manure that you can skip."

The animation is horrible and the plot line made me want to punch myself in the face over and over again. I hate this movie so much! It\u2019s the worst film I\u2019ve seen in a while. I give it a 2 because they tried, but this film deserves a 0."

The songs are great. It is a good movie to watch with the whole family this Christmas. This movie made me appreciate Mother Mary even more while at the same time get the magical feeling about Jesus Christ birth"
