The movie is lam, is bad, bad taste, jokes that are not funny. It will be a classic of the bad, it will dissapear from the movie rentals IF get there."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "The title of the movie pretty much explains it all. The appeal of this road trip style buddy comedy is watching it's two leads (Daniels and Carrey) act like complete morons. The shear stupidity of their character can lead can lead to some funny moments. However pacing moments a quite a few failed gags bring the movie down.\r For one thing it feels like it goes on for much longer than it actually does. The gags in the middle portion of the film are where most of the misses take place. A few of them are lame gross out gags and fart jokes, but for the most part it relies on Jim Carrey making those stupid facial expressions of his. I, for one, have never found that funny of him.\r It's not hard to see why so many have enjoyed this. It's brainless sense of humor is sure to get some laughs from people. How to judge how much you'll enjoy this really just comes down to how big of a Jim Carrey fan you are. It really plays off of the type of humor he's known for. I am personally not a fan of his so this movie didn't really do much for me outside of a few chuckles.\r While it has struck the funny bone of so many people over the years I just couldn't get into it. There are plenty of better and smarter comedies out there, and ones that don't drag so much throughout their running time. You can defend the movie by saying being dumb is the point of it, however that doesn't mean it' going to resonate with everyone. While it does have some funny moments at the beginning and near the end, there's a lengthy middle section here that serves no purpose other than filling driving time in the plot. It's that time wasted that ultimately killed the movie for me."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Dumb and Dumber revels in its juvenile and crude behaviour, it's the sort of film I sometimes feel ashamed to call side-splitting and brilliant, not from start to finish but it's various moments where it is utterly impossible not to roll over on tears of laughter for the stupidity you are seeing.\rJim Carrey and Jeff Daniels participate in the film that arguably kick started both their careers, they share a convincing comedic presence on screen, with a script that paints them as utter morons, thinking an Austrian accent qualifies to rhyme of a \"G'day mate.\" Or that Aspen is in California. These one-lined treasures rely on the timing of the actors, and they are timed with perfect precision. They take a road trip out of love and I'm turn get mixed up with some unsavoury people.\rThey take the trip to return a briefcase to Aspen where Lloyd's brief rendezvous with a rich woman has him head over heels.Their misadventures are the selling point of the film, taking wrong turns, having toilet relations and fooling blind children, the humour is ridiculous, but one can't help but laugh uncontrollably.\rJim Carrey brings to life the character of Lloyd, whose unorthodox personality and 'witty' ideas lead the film, while Jeff Daniels has his own moments, it's Carrey who steals the show. The stupidity can at times seem like a cover for an underlying sparkle of wit, purposely leaving it to the star power to make it good. One such case is a particular toilet scene, while flatulence can be no laughing matter, the scene relies on the facial expressions of Daniels, who does it with the upmost hilarity.\rThe characters they play paint a picture of buddies who never seem to take anything seriously, even at gunpoint, their quips and arrogance of situations make the film what it is.\rThe premise is simple and easy to follow, buts the performances and writing that push the envelope and make this a comedy that is hard to forget, it could be the era in which it came out or perhaps the talent involved, at almost 20 years old, the film still stands among viewers as one of the funniest to come along, with a sequel always sought after. Its the audience who speak, and this is one of those comedies that just works."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "This is a really funny movie with great actors but it doesn't hit my type of humor exactly and only because of that i point it not higher then 6 points."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "One of the funniest movies of all time, if you dont laugh at this you have no sense of humor, by far my favorite movie."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "There are no movies that come anywhere close to Dumb and Dumber.

For some reason people who don't like it tend to say things like, \"too crude,\" \"its toilet humor\" and other architypically pompous criticisms. Personally I have a very silly childish sense of humor and I love it. It helps me see the funny side to everything in life even the most absurd of bad luck. And that's why I love this film, it perfectly reflects the futile struggle of growing up as a young male in this society, wanting all those things you'll probably just never get, and generally being down on your luck most of the time. But you know you'll look back at the crazy things that happen and having a good friend in the same position makes it all OK. I used to watch this with my best friend when we first started hanging out in our own flats and houses I have probably seen it about 30 times. I would go so far as to say that if someone doesn't like this film I probably wouldn't have anything in common with them and therefore would probably not want to hang around with them."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Probably the funniest movie of all time if you haven't seen it go get a bunch of your buddies, a 12 pack, and get ready to laugh your ass off."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "What a classic.
