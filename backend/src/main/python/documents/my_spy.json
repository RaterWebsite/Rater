The casting feels like a mixed bag with strangely emotionless Botox faced Bautista as the titular spy. I felt like they wanted to remake the kindergarten cop but forgot to make their own style along the way. The writing is the biggest fail here. It really was a missed opportunity to make something interesting. Barely watchable.

But i enjoyed watching it while doing other things at same time so was nice"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "In My Spy, currently on Amazon Prime, a young girl (Chloe Coleman) blackmails a CIA operative on a stakeout (Guardians of the Galaxy's Dave Bautista) into helping her out with her life. I thought this was decent.Let me start out by saying that this is predictable. It's the general story of the odd couple becoming friends and a tough law enforcement/government agent working with kids like Kindergarten Cop and The Pacifier. (This is very The Pacifier). The predictability can at moments make things drag as you can tell what's going to happen and are just waiting for the movie to go where it's going to go. The love interest in particular feels by-the-numbers and rushed and lacks chemistry.Despite all that, this was still an enjoyable time for me. The movie's cookie cutter, but competently handled. It's the two leads that make this movie as they manage to elevate the material and work so well with each other. If you were one of those people that thought that Bautista's character in this film and in his last one Stuber seemed really similar (they are both comically impulsive men of the law), you'll pleased to know you're not just watching the same performance. I thought Bautista works a lot better here. He's a lot more nuanced and easy-to-like. The Last Man on Earth's Kristen Schall also does a decent job as Bautista's partner on the stakeout.Admittedly, there are only a couple of downright funny parts, but the humor generally works and has its charm.This is a PG-13 family film. Most of this is basic family film storyline mixed in with the occasional bit for adults.Overall, I recommend this. It's not perfection, but it's a generally nice film for a group deciding on something to watch on a Friday night."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Below average entertainer for me.Like many people says it's exactly the big tough guy meets a little girl type movie.Dave Bautista was kind of cool but we have seen better performances from him in the past.Chloe Coleman as the kid is really good she outperforms everyone in acting.The Direction is average too.The Verdict: One time passable watch family-friendly movie."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "My Spy is my favorite comedy movie of 2020, one of my top 10 favorite movies of 2020, and one of my favorite movies of all time. The chemistry between Dave Bautista and Chloe Coleman was phenomenal and so cute. The acting from Dave Bautista, Kristen Schaal, Chloe Coleman, and Parisa Fitz-Henley was outstanding, they were very funny. The writing was excellent and really funny. The music choices were great, every song fit perfectly in the movie. This was a really fun, entertaining, and cute movie."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "(Mauro Lanari)Clean, pleasant, entertaining, free of vulgar or violent scenes: a real rarity for this period."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Welcome back, Streamers! One benefit of being stuck inside all of the time\u2026 is the movies that studios are forced to bring to us. We have been blessed by this mess and I\u2019m grateful for the blessings I have. One of those blessings this week was My Spy. This movie is starring Dave Bautista, as JJ, the meathead C.I.A. agent that gets selected to do the one job he can \u201chandle\u201d by watching a daughter and mother, Chloe Coleman, as Sophie, and Parisa Fitz-Henley, as Kate. We all know what happens after that. This movie is exactly what the trailer shows you (check it out below). If you think it\u2019s going to happen in the movie\u2026 Oh, yeah, it\u2019s going to happen. And do you know what? It\u2019s still hilarious. I\u2019ll admit I\u2019d written this movie off when it was coming to the theaters but since it came to a streaming service I had to give it a shot. Here it goes.Dave Bautista, as rigid and mono-tone, as he is, just has \u201cit\u201d. And, by \u201cit,\u201d I mean that comedic gene. Maybe you love him as Drax in the MCU, but you might say it\u2019s the writing. In my opinion, Bautista still hits hard in My Spy. He doesn\u2019t have the range of everyone\u2019s favorite Dwayne Johnson\u2026 yet. I think if he gets a few more diverse roles that don\u2019t stifle his growth then he can possibly get there. Did we really think that Arnold Schwarzenegger was going to give us comedic gold throughout the years? We didn\u2019t, but here we are watching Kindergarten Cop and Jingle All the Way every year. On the flip side, Chloe Coleman is just a pleasure. Now, they may have given her all the great lines in this movie, but her comedic acting ability is evident. She jumps off the screen\u2026 except in her like cry moment\u2026 that was forced trash but otherwise so much fun.Bautista and Coleman give The Rock and Kevin Hart a run for their money in this one and, respectively, they are both the same heights. I doubt we\u2019ll see another Bautista/Coleman team up, but I hope we see each of them in other parts. My Spy provides action, comedy, and that needed feeling of companionship we can\u2019t achieve during the pandemic. This movie created with chemistry and charisma what Coffee and Kareem tried, and failed, to create with vulgarity.Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised by My Spy. I thought this would be a cliched and predictable big bad guy and little kid flick and it was but like Kindergarten Cop back in the day this was ultimately a guilty pleasure film that I don\u2019t really feel guilty about. As part of the world goes back to quarantining and the other half tries to figure out re-opening properly, grab a bowl of popcorn and check out My Spy on Prime Video."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "While it certainly contains creative comedy.

Such a nice guy. The rest of the cast also delivers their roles perfectly, truly making this a movie you can have the coziest evening to with your loved ones. I hope there will be a sequel, I even made my profile Just to rate this movie. OMG i havent seen i could rate it 10, i thought 5 was the highest. Make a sequel please.
