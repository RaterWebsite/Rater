For every School of Rock or King Kong he has starred in there has been an Orange County or Envy. Unfortunately, despite coming from the writer and director of the excellent Napoleon Dynamite, this is certainly one of his worst movies to date.\r I have no problem with silly, over the top comedies (Zoolander and Austin Powers are amongst my favourite comic films) but when you can look back and count the number of times a movie made you laugh, twice by the way, there is certainly something wrong. It may not be as bad as anything from the Scary Movie franchise but I certainly won\u2019t be watching again anytime soon."

Like that other Jared Hess comedy, most of the humor comes from watching characters in a slightly cartoonish world do and say ridiculous things in a deadpan manner. Only because this is a Nickelodeon production there are also fart jokes. That's kind of the problem. This is primarily aimed at children so the whole thing is very juvenile. Too juvenile even. There are some themes you can pick out involving being unhappy with your place in life specifically in regards to class and some shots taken at organized religion, but it will all go over the kids' heads while adults will be too annoyed by all the slapstick and gross out gags to care. The are certainly some funny moments, but not enough to keep this from missing the mark with the older members of the family."

The filmmaker isn't going to make a major star look stupid. Most, if not all, of the laughs aren't generated from the script or situation, but because Esquelto(Richard Montoya) looks dissheveled and speaks funny. It's as if Sara Silverman created Esquelto. Incredibly, the usually hyper Black is almost like a straight man. \"Nacho Libre\" is somewhat redeemed by an atypical premise and a setting that feels at times, otherworldly."

      "text": "Nacho Libre is a good natured family film thats got some fuuny bits but by the response of the thirty 13 year olds in the crowd it was Hilarious, there in lies the problem. Jared Hess tries to capture all the things that made Napolean the hit it was by using that same subdued humor, the\"feel sorry for me\" charasters, even the look of a shoestring budget indie film but he holds the reins on Jack Black so he's merely Father Napolean. It works if that's what you're going to see, but I can't stop hoping Black will finally make a movie that's not so family-friendly and he'll let out that John Belushi in him in something I can't take the kids to see. The song \"A really religious person\" and the one he sings about the nun offer a hint of what i'm talking about. Come on Jack, R-rated comedies are the thing again!"

The Benchwarmers just plain sucked - only laughed once and it was a very gross movie. Nacho Libre had countless funny scenes and had the entire audience laughing out loud. The type of laughing where you laugh until tears are in your eyes sometimes. This movie has a great plot (it has an ACTUAL plot compared to say, Napoleon Dynamite) with all the denumont (sp?), rising action, climax, falling action. It has GREAT acting (especially if you like Jack Black) and was well written. Also the nun is great with her chemistry."

Maybe the producers did not pay off the critics or maybe the public in general can't handle a comedy that has some creativity to it. I don't know. What I do know is I laughed out loud from beginning to end. Between all the weird characters they fought, to Jack Blacks improvised songs, to the silly little tights he'd frolic around in, the movie became an instant classic in my book. I highly recommend this movie."

      "text": "In what promises to be a very typical movie summer stuffed with remakes, sequels and comic book adaptations (some of the above quite good; that's not the point) any time you catch sight of such an odd duck as this, you'd do well to heed its quack. This endearingly goofy slapstick opus about a Mexican monk (Jack Black) who, in order to earn money to feed the parish orphans, indulges his fascination for Masked Marvel-type wrestling (much to the displeasure of his priestly superiors) is a true original. (I suppose if you wanted to be really picayune about it you could note some surface similarities between this and a very straightforward 1956 B-movie entitled The Leather Saint, in which John Derek puts on the boxing gloves in order to help the needy of HIS church. You could even wonder if, since both films were Paramount releases, if screenwriter Mike White and director Jared Hess had to pay some royalties. But if you do, that's not just being overly picky...it's being downright anal!) Given Black's usual amusingly over-the-top approach to his roles, which culminated last year in a full-blooded portrayal of Carl Denham in Peter Jackson's King Kong that out-hammed Robert Armstrong's work in the original, it's a real surprise to observe just how much he UNDERPLAYS his role here, and with wonderful results: at times Black even seems to be aping the hilariously off-kilter English dubbing that's a fundamental ingredient of the 1960s Mexican \"Santo\" epics that he and White are obvious devotees of. Like many one-of-a-kind movies, Nacho Libre successfully blends and embraces a number of seeming contradictions: it features almost as many bodily-function-and-fluid gags as Adam Sandler's current Click (including an unforgettable cow-pasture sequence in which Nacho's tag-team partner gets LITERALLY sh*t-faced) but they come off as strangely innocent rather than obnoxious and offensive; Hess's near-Felliniesque depiction of the impoverished locals' grotesque appearances (if there ever was a town dentist, it's apparent that he used pliers and no Novacaine) doesn't make his film difficult to watch, and Nacho's mutual puppy love for a sweet young nun (Ana de la Reguera, who resembles a cross between Anne Hathaway and Winona Ryder, so who can blame him?) is just one of many factors that makes Nacho Libre, in spite of all the bone-crushing ring action, one of the GENTLEST mainstream films of the last few years! Hess, matching the deadpan tone he brought to his 2004 cult smash Napoleon Dynamite, still has some pacing issues to overcome; like his previous film, there are definite slow spots, and Nacho Libre ultimately comes off more as a series of skits than a unified whole. But many of those skits are undeniably smile-inducers, and on the whole Nacho Libre is so engaging, offbeat and weirdly amusing that even though I wasn't at all a Napoleon fan, this makes me want to watch it again and reevaluate it. Who knows--maybe I'll actually vote for Pedro this time!"
