      "text": "This is a superb thriller and one of my favorite films this year. Story and characters are both very compelling and it was great to see how Reacher unraveled the mystery. I don't get the negative responses and suspect most probably have to do with a personal dislike of Tom Cruise or that the movie was not exactly like the books. Regardless, I loved the pacing and thought the action was great and all very realistic. Reacher is also an extremely interesting character to learn about... very intelligent, sarcastic and witty, mysterious, and strong. He's analogous to James Bond and Cruise does a fantastic job here. I very highly recommend this movie."

      "text": "The only thing worthy in Jack Reacher is watching Tom Cruise being a badass. Other than that is just another decent popcorn movie that will keep you entertained enough a Saturday afternoon in which you have nothing better to do. The plot is mainly exposition-driven and it becomes so convoluted at some point that you won't mind understanding the stakes in it, which aren't very interesting anyway. Rosamund Pike and Robert Duvall are enjoyable to watch, Jai Courtney has a lot of potential as an action star (we'll confirm that in A Good Day To Die Hard) and Werner Herzog is just a one-dimensional Russian stereotype. But well, the flaws don't really matter, Jack Reacher achieves its goal and Cruise reminds us why he is one of the greatest action stars of all time."

Cruise's character is the type of hero that always seems to be one step ahead of the bad guys, and can handle anything thrown his way. What's wrong with that?  The audience, my daughter, and myself thoroughly enjoyed this film.  I've never read any of the 17 Jack Reacher books, and maybe that is where the complaints are coming from. There have been books turned into movies that pissed me off because they were not true to the source, but the author didn't have a problem with this adaptation, and I don't think you will either."

      "text": "While I thought the movie could have used a couple more action scenes the plot made up for any lack. The few fight scenes were, however, extremely well done. It's a great crime whodunnit and cruise keeps the tension and suspense going throughout. Duvall has a short part but helps make the film. Whenever there is great disparity in critic reviews (0-83). (Note that the WSJ gave the 0) my radar goes up. A scene where Reacher explains why he lives off the grid away from our programmed work/sleep routine effectively lifts the veil on those Wall St Nazis who've  literally enslaved us all and I believe that is what pissed off their media whores. Show them that you see through their smokescreen and go enjoy the film - and think about the deeper message -it's an interesting one."

Story is mildly entertaining and Robert Duval adds his usual excellence. The film is so basic that it makes slow pitch softball look high-speed, but given that even Tom Cruise could screw it up. Sorry I never forgave him for the debacle that was War of the Worlds. Captain Crazypants and the Scientology wackos must have gotten \"clear\" just long enough to make a movie that is just entertaining enough to fill the void between now and the next summer season. This is just like dating, set your standards low enough and you will never be disappointed."

Noveno libro de la Saga del escritor Lee Child publicado en 2005.\rGratamente sorprendida al darme cuenta que Jack Reacher no es enteramente una pel\u00edcula de acci\u00f3n, tristemente decepcionada al ver una historia  floja  y sin ninguna sorpresa con actuaciones  pobres que no reflejan el recorrido actoral de los  protagonistas.\rInicia con una de las mejores escenas de la pel\u00edcula y el eje central, un tiroteo perpetuado a manos de un francotirador.  Francotirador que es ubicado y capturado r\u00e1pidamente dej\u00e1ndonos pensar que su culpabilidad es inminente, sin embargo en el desarrollo de la trama las cosas cambian viendo como al entrar al juego Jack Reacher logra ubicarnos en una perspectiva diferente.\rTom Cruise protagoniza el papel del exmilitar Jack Reacher, con una actuaci\u00f3n predecible similar a la de Misi\u00f3n Imposible o  Minority Report con la diferencia de que en esta tiene la habilidad de dejar mujeres suspirando por el a su paso, es Cruise el encargado de la acci\u00f3n, el que todo lo sabe, el que investiga, el que descubre, el que pelea,  y al final el h\u00e9roe, papel que ya conoce y que protagoniza perfectamente sin ningun esfuerzo. Con mucha seriedad y pocas sonrisas Reacher se adentra en la oscuridad de un guion flojo y logra desenmara\u00f1ar el complot que se envuelve en medio de los intentos de convertir esta historia en un thriller.\rExcelente fueron las escenas de acci\u00f3n, pocas pero cre\u00edbles, buenos  planos, coreograf\u00eda, sonido y con mucha claridad en el momento de los golpes y pu\u00f1os, seguida por una espectacular persecuci\u00f3n en auto con un buen montaje que no deja que el espectador pierda el plano ni el sentido de ubicaci\u00f3n (Caso contrario al de las pel\u00edculas de Jason Bourne)\rTristemente desaprovechadas las actuaciones de Richard Jenkins, Robert Duval, con personajes que no aportan nada actoralmente y que al parecer solo quer\u00edan un dinerito extra. Rosamund Pike en un papel mediocre, que no logra pasar de la chica en apuros a la que hay que salvar, dejando por el piso el aporte femenino de la pel\u00edcula. Con el villano tengo mis dudas, ya que queriendo dar la sensaci\u00f3n de temor con la historia en la que se comi\u00f3 sus propios dedos no lo logra, por el contrario es eclipsado por Jai Courtney (Charlie) que nos regala unos buenos momentos de acci\u00f3n junto a Cruise.\rEn resumen tenemos un thriller de acci\u00f3n entretenido con unas peque\u00f1a pizca de comedia, que intenta mezclar a James Bond con Sherlock Holmes sin \u00e9xito, pero al final logra salir airosa gracias a Tom Cruise que sin ser este su mejor papel ha realizado un gran trabajo intentando sacar a flote este proyecto junto con McQuarrie que deber\u00eda pensarlo mejor antes de aventurarse nuevamente en el roll de director, sabiendo que como escritor ha obtenido mejores resultados como en The Usual Suspects.\rSi quieres pasar un rato entretenido junto a tus amigos en donde no tengas que utilizar tu materia gris Jack Reacher es la pelicula."

      "text": "Jack Reacher had some good and memorable moments, but overall it just felt like a cheesy crime drama series that you can find every night on TV.  This movie is based on the book \"One Shot\" written by Lee Child, which is just one of a series of Jack Reacher novels.  So this guy is sort of an icon in the literature world, and so when they wanted to adapt a movie from it and it kind of fell flat for me.  Don't get me wrong I had a good time seeing this movie and it wasn't actually bad, but there just really is nothing here that we haven't seen a thousand times before.  This guy is a cop and he plays by his own rules, who hasn't seen that dozens of times?  I realize its based off a book, but I just didn't think he was the great and intimidating action character that the film's trailer makes him out to be.  But the main reason someone is going to see this is for Tom Cruise, I mean lets face it, if he weren't in this film nobody would care about it whatsover.  I mean just a few weeks ago we had Alex Cross and everyone was disappointed with that, and now we have another crime mystery thriller.  This almost feels like it should've been released in the summer so that it wouldn't have much high expectations with a end of the year release, but sadly it must compete with the big and powerful films of December.  Some things I did like about it were the car chase sequences, which were exciting and gave the movie a little variety.  Some of the fighting scenes between Cruse and the bad guys were fun as well, but if you watch closely you can tell that these are some of the dumbest and clumsiest bad guys I have seen in a action movie for a long time.  Christopher McQuarrie directed this movie, and I enjoy a lot of his work, so I appreciate what he was trying to make here but it just wasn't as good as it should've been.  I'm not sure if I could ever make a better movie than this, but there are some moments in this film where you know they could've fixed to make it less ridiculous.  This film is fun if all you want is a simple action flick, but as for me, I crave something a little more well done."

You don't go to see this movie anticipating another Mission Impossible sized blockbuster.  This is what the critics don't seem to understand.\r How does it deliver on it's promise to entertain?  Very well.   JR is a brisk entertaining adventure with a stoic and smartly played lead by Tom Cruse.    He delivers what he promised, kick butt fun.\r In my opinion the writing is smart.   The bad guys have good dialog (while we are left feeling somewhat unsatisfied on the back-story, but this is the fault of the writers not the movie) but still feel the villians are to be feared, both for their ferocity and intelligence.\r Jack Reacher is pure fun pop-corn entertainment and is highly recommended as such."

My midnight show crowd was fairly raucous with the laughs, and there were plenty of oohs/aahs during the driving/fighting sequences, so I'm guessing this is more of a target demo film than one for the critics, who seem pretty evenly divided. It has a hard-edged pulpy feel to it - and it keeps you thinking throughout. The opening sequence is particularly brutal - it's understandable why the studio cancelled the premiere in light of the recent school shootings. Tom Cruise does an effective job in the lead (I have no frame of reference with the source material, incidentally, so the complaints over his casting are lost on me). Rosamund Pike is excellent - she needs to be in more films that require some range instead of doing the next Wrath of the Titans sequel. And Robert Duvall - it's great to see him make an appearance, even in a small role. The end left me with slightly mixed feelings, but on the whole, I enjoyed the thrill ride."

Tom as a main actor was excellent - he really assumed the role he had to play in a way that made me feel like I understood Jack Reacher as a character and person well. The secondary main actor (character Helen) was good too - she played the role very well. The story line was just the right amount of action, mystery and a pinch of romance (very slight). The way the plot rolled out was great in that it left you wondering what was really going on at every moment - who the bad guys were, who was involved and who wasn't, what really happened and what didn't and so on.

Its entertaining, with the requisite one-liners, fights (which unlike Nolan's Batman, are extremely easy to follow and enjoy), and great characters.\r Of course McQuarrie delivers a few twists, as much as the source material will allow, but that's not really the point.  You know who the bad guy is, you know who the good guy is, and you enjoy seeing them converge in a hail of bullets and fist fights is entertaining.\r Where the film really stands out, is that this type of character hasn't really existed in this genre.  He's not a cowboy, thrill-seeker, or invincible hero.  He's a guy who likes anonymity, quiet, and ultimately justice - by any means necessary.  He doesn't answer to a police captain or superior (thank god), he's funded by his pention and lives meagerly by preference (refreshing) so he can't be bought.  He's simply a war vet who is fed up with the stench of bureaucracy.\r I truly hope audiences give this a look, because I can say without question that Reacher is going to get better with each adventure, as his character is complex and timely where we all wish someone could just punch the loudmouth at the bar, skip the jurisdictions, and shoot the bad guys to avoid lawyers letting them go free."

From the landscaping shots of the sniper scenes to the close cam car chases, it feels more intense, especially since the particular chase scene had no score or background music at all, and it simply worked.\rCruise does bring difference to a role that many would have seen as another Ethan Hawke, but Cruise manages to draw the line in his movies where he knows what the difference needs to be, Cruise's Reacher is calm, he's isolated, motivated, but more importantly, not afraid to seek justice by any means necessary, and this was portrayed on screen.\rRosamund Pike makes a starring role as counsellor Heen Rodin, and daughter to District Attorney Alex Rodin (Richard Jenkins), there is also a minor appearance from Robert Duvall.\rWhile the turn of events and climax of the film are predictable, it still has a smart finish with guns glitz an glamour.\rThe films dialogue was very good indeed and the humorous moments in the film did show that care needed to be taken not to take the film too seriously.

      "text": "Jack Reacher is not completely without its merits. Devout followers of Lee Child\u2019s novels had trouble accepting Tom Cruise as the strapping, Viking-esque eponymous protagonist, but to reject Tommy Boy too early is a big mistake: for all the constantly-swirling controversy Cruise somehow continues to keep simmering, he\u2019s as able to both fill seats and entertain now as he ever has been. In fact, Cruise\u2019s steely cool is perhaps Christopher McQuarrie\u2019s film\u2019s grandest asset. One can\u2019t quite shake the fact, though, that there should be at the very least a bit more popcorn fun to Jack Reacher. McQuarrie has assembled a sensational cast  Richard Jenkins, Robert Duvall, and even our favorite thickly-accented fusspot Werner Herzog appear here  but after the gleeful advent of their mere presence wears off, there\u2019s not all that much for them to do. Jack Reacher wants to be a new kind of Mission: Impossible where Bourne Supremacy-esque action replaces any deep need for well-rounded character, but McQuarrie and Cruise never fully get around to successfully making their case. This is easily-digestible Hollywood fare, to be sure, but there\u2019s not quite enough meat on the bone here."

Close to super hero status. Everyone else in the movie has a hard time keeping their wits, but Jack Reacher shows everyone their ignorance, and gets **** done.\r Jack Reacher has one mood/tone/persona, and it never changes. The movie presents about every five minutes that it has blown your mind, but it is completely underwhelming, predictable, and cheesy.\r The two points I did give the movie were because of Rosamund Pike, who I"

I feel like I threw away two hours of my life and will never get it back. The lead actress was wooden and laughable, as if she were trying to emote with a face-full of Botox. Tom Cruise was standard Tom Cruise. I got so angry by the end at the fact that I had to sit through this pathetic movie that I threw my bottle of water on the floor."

This action movie might not pile up a ton of action, but the action it does have is believable and exciting. Tom Cruise does yet another excellent performance. Its not the most thought-provoking mystery movie i've seen, but it is epic."

      "text": "I'm a fan of Tom Cruise the actor, but he doesn't cover any new ground in this over the top, ludicrous film.  Your eyes will be rolling throughout.  It isn't a horrible film, and it is mostly watchable and entertaining, but you really have to ignore all the implausibilities and go with it.  This was my first exposure to the lead actress Rosamund Pike and I wasn't impressed.  Her acting was unrealistic and unemotional throughout.  I don't know if the director was responsible or if it was her decision but she didn't behave like a normal person, particularly in the hostage scene.  The Robert Duvall character was really ridiculous.  You really felt like you were watching a poor version of Dirty Harry.  I can't quite recommend it, but I've seen so many movies like this throughout my life I've become jaded by them.  A younger person might like it more."

But as far as movie entertainment goes, JR was a very satisfying action thriller. In fact, I enjoyed it much more than the latest James Bond flick (Skyfall) which has garnered across the board positive reviews. Say what you will about Cruise (and his controversial views / behavior ) but let's at least be fair!  Writer-Director Christopher McQuarrie has made a very entertaining movie. This is the best Tom Cruise flick I've seen in years..."

Tom Cruise id a midget compared to what the character is supposed to be.  Not to mention WAY to much plastic surgery and botox.  Relay violent, and cliched, with no satisfaction to be had.  Save yourself the money, and if you must see this, wait for it on cable, which may show up as early as next week considering how terrible it is."

      "text": "The film starts off very stylish, looking every bit the classic cop movies of the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s. Sadly it does not keep this early promise and soon slips into the usual clich\u00e9\u2018s that have haunted many more recent cop films. I found it very hard to connect with any of the characters, although all the performances were very good. I did particularly like Werner Herzog as The Zec, a particularly shady character; other than that it was pretty mundane. I found it a bit bloated and over-long although it did pick up towards the end.\r SteelMonster\u2019s verdict: RECOMMENDED (Just)\r My score: 5.8/10."
