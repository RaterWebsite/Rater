True science fiction, dealing with scientific conceits, not ray guns and tentacled monsters, that plays with your mind like the very best Twilight Zone ever had to offer. Certainly one of the most enjoyable films I have seen in recent years. I watched it three times in three days, each time catching a few more significant details."

It's unashamedly intellectual so won't appeal to everyone and I also feel that the ideas could have been fleshed out a little more for a greater impact. If the film had been half an hour longer it would have been perfect for me. The ending is brilliant though, one of the best I've seen in ages and the concept behind it both fantastic and disturbing."

      "text": "This is a legitimately good, intelligent sci-fi film. it doesn't try be \"pretend sc-fi\" by using cgi, futuristic technology, and other gimmicks. Instead, it takes a very unique idea grounded in some science and revolves the whole film around it.\r Despite having low production values and relatively unknown actors, the film has very good writing and acting. The chemistry between the actors was very good, and their dialogue was some of the best and most believable I've seen on film. I never felt bored watching this film, despite most of it taking place in a house and showing people talking. This is the real testament to quality writing.\r This film will surprise you, and engage your mind in trying to understand what exactly is happening. My only real complaint, and the reason I couldn't give this a 9 or a 10, is because at the end the protagonist acts contrary to her character."

So much was done here with such a small budget. I watched it with two others and we were all silent and gripped throughout, yet couldn't stop talking about it afterwards.\r To even say that it's a sci-fi movie is somewhat a spoiler, but unavoidable. It's best to go in knowing as little as possible. One of the most enjoyable and refreshing sci-fi movies I've seen in some time and one that managed to build up quite the sense of dread towards the end. It'll have you trying to guess what's going to happen next, all while doubting everything that you've seen on screen.\r An under-rated little gem of a film."

      "text": "One of the best sci-fi movies I've seen in a while.  Some slick storytelling magic that keeps everything just enough out-of-whack to instill a sense of dread.  A very dialogue-driven movie, and the dialogue is believable.  Has a loose, quick vibe - the actors are all able and for the most part believable, and it seems they were left a little improvisational wriggle-room to make the scenes that much more realistic.  The premise is ridiculous and Twilight Zone-worthy, but the way it plays out makes you feel like it's really happening.  Comet overhead causes odd things to occur and I'll leave it at that - the story best plays out when you have no expectations of what's to come.  As others have said, the fact that this movie gets the blood pumping and tensions rising with no special effects or over-the-top gore, no A-list actors or sweeping cinematography (the camera work is great, though) - is a testament to the power of good storytelling."

      "text": "I...what. Coherence is a mindbending science fiction film that will toss your brain for loops as more and more absurd things keep occuring and are to be expected. When things keep progressing and getting worse, it becomes even more and mindbending and now my brain hurts. Coherence turned my mind into mush. Yet, it is oddly coherent and makes sense. Even if it is beyond explanation, it never leaves the grasp of director James Ward Byrkit. Instead, it is an audacious directorial debut for Byrkit that should hopefully propel him to handling bigger and, ideally, even more original films.\r Incredibly original, it is hard to think of a comparison for Coherence. Some have cited the influence of The Twilight Zone and from what I have heard about that show, it probably makes sense. However, in terms of film, Coherence largely stands alone. Showing the events of a dinner party during the passing of a comet, Coherence is a film that really messes with your mind from beginning to end and forces you to keep up with it. Fortunately, Byrkit avoids any unnecessary exposition, which really helps to add to the atmosphere. This confused and lost party and their fear is matched by the audience as we try to piece things along with them. Byrkit could have lost their confusion if he kept stopping to explain everything. Instead, he pushes the pedal to the metal and plunges forward.\r Featuring a largely unknown cast, Coherence is not necessarily a film about its characters. That said, the acting across the board is solid. Plus, the writing of the characters is solid. Nothing extraordinary, nor are they incredibly deep, but their pasts and their stories are important as the film progresses. For them, it is the key to knowing where and who they are.\r More than anything, Coherence shows serious ambition. For this to be Byrkit's debut is an absolute wonder. It is not perfect by any means and probably gets too caught up in philosophy and quantum physics to be truly accessible or perfect. That said, a more experienced director would have problems keeping this one under wraps and having it somehow stay coherent. Instead, many would let the film got bogged down within itself and make no sense in the end. For Byrkit, however, things remain oddly linear. Who we are watching is unbeknownst to us, yet everything is the same and the viewer is able to follow the plot without nary a hitch. As Byrkit adds more and more layers to this film, things remain within our grasp and the film never feels like it is too much. It never feels silly. Instead, this air of paranoia and confusion runs rampant and truly arrests the viewer.\r Showcasing serious potential for James Ward Byrkit in the director's chair, this mindbending film is a terrifying, atmospheric, somehow coherent, and truly original science fiction film. It is a rarity nowadays to say that, but it is the absolute truth. In creating this original film, Byrkit was incredibly ambitious and trusting of his audience to follow him wherever he opted to go. The end result is a truly engrossing experience that - for lovers of science fiction - will pay off in spades."

      "text": "A regular independent film, which seems to have neglected the most technical aspects.Low-budget independent films are boxes of surprises. You never know if they are excellent or crap. This film seemed like a good bet, with a plot based on a group of friends who get together for dinner during the passage of a comet that, in a somewhat mysterious way, causes a series of problems such as the Internet and electricity failing, broken cell phones and , stranger still, a juxtaposition of parallel realities.I thought it would be more of a psychological horror film, and I believe there are scenes where some inroads are made in this field, but the suspense and the clever mystery created end up standing out. However, the characters are poor and very clich\u00e9, and the whole story becomes so strange that it quickly loses credibility. At one point, it all sounds so surreal that it doesn't really matter what really happened there. Another annoying thing was having so many characters talking on top of each other during the film. If it happens on time it makes things more authentic, but if it is always happening it is too much. None of the actors are known, the bet was on unknown names, but with experience in indie films and sporadic participation in TV series (Emily Baldoni, Maury Sterling, Nicholas Brendon etc.).The film uses sound effects and music quite well to increase suspense and become more tense. Being a low budget film it is not surprising that there is only one filming location and that it is a relatively poor film. What is more difficult to forgive is the rather amateur work of filming, with most scenes so shaky that it seems that the cameraman was nervous. Another thing that is not easily forgiven is the deficient editing and post-production work. These are details that may seem of less relevance but that can lose the chances of a serious film career."

No spoilers, but the ending is awful, makes no sense and completely contradicts the central protagonist's character.  I felt like they ran out of budget or something and the producer burst in on the writer during lunch, said \"We can't afford the ending you wrote!  You need to wrap up this story in ten minutes!  You have five minutes to write the new resolution!\" and things went from there.  I mean, I literally have never seen a more random smeg of an ending in all my life.  They completely went off the rails and just rushed towards something, ANYTHING in what appeared to be raw desperation.  It would be like if this review started talking about fire ants or something.

      "text": "The term \u2018sci-fi\u2019 can bring to mind images of mega-budget action sequences and CGI futurescapes; in stark contrast, the most exciting sci-fi in years takes place in the present day and features eight people sitting around a dining room table. Coherence, which is currently garnering much acclaim at festivals and independent showings, is an exceptional (and refreshing) cinematic experience, both as an example of the sci-fi genre and independent cinema in general. Produced on a shoestring budget in director James Ward Byrkit\u2019s house, Coherence manages to blow its big-budget competitors out of the water via a sensational concept supported by a solid cast.When eight friends meet up for an ordinary dinner party, it seems like any other night, until a power cut mysteriously leaves only theirs and one other house with power. Soon the situation becomes disorienting and bizarre when photos and notes start turning up belonging to the dinner party guests, presumably from the other house. The film then descends into an expanding riddle about paranoia and alternate realities, as one character, Em, emerges as the audience surrogate, watching her friends \u2013 and herself \u2013 fall apart at the seams, in a situation that they don\u2019t understand.Much of Coherence\u2019s success stems from its focus on the central premise \u2013 the key idea is so good that it doesn\u2019t bother to waste time with anything else. Aside from a small amount of character set-up in the opening, there are no pauses. All other character development occurs as the story moves along, both lending the film excellent pace and helping the viewer keep up with the increasingly complex story. Coherence also manages to steer almost entirely clear of one of science fiction\u2019s least desirable traits: tedious exposition. A useful snippet of information here and there is all the viewer needs. The filmmakers trust the audience\u2019s intelligence.A major strength of Coherence is found in the performances \u2013 each actor creates a character so whole and alive it feels as if they go on living while off-screen, not just puppets illustrating a story. While Nicolas Brendon may be the only familiar face in the line-up (having famously played Xander in Buffy the Vampire Slayer), the entire cast performs exceptionally well. It will not come as a surprise to those who have seen the film to learn that the dialogue was improvised based only on character descriptions and loose scene outlines. This gives the film an outstanding sense of realism, grounding the strange occurrences in a solid and familiar setting.Director Byrkit has several times in interviews acknowledged and cited the Twilight Zone as a source of inspiration, and Coherence certainly has a sense of a modern, feature-length episode of the iconic TV show. One of the things Coherence will leave you with is the tantalizing question of \u201cwhat would you do?\u201d, not dissimilar to the effect of a great Twilight Zone parable. No doubt this will help the film\u2019s shareability no end \u2013 it certainly makes the viewing experience a memorable, if haunting, one. This is a film that rewards repeat viewings; there\u2019s a wealth of clues and allusions so subtle they would go completely unnoticed to even the most eagle-eyed first-time viewer.Coherence has been crafted with love and intelligence, overcoming the obstacle of its minuscule budget to prove that real cinema doesn\u2019t need whistles and bells to have an impact. While it has most definitely succeeded artistically, being praised by both critics and cinemagoers alike, the only problem Coherence now faces is reaching the audience it deserves \u2013 the production has precious little money for marketing and distribution."

It took 10-15 minutes too long for the characters to understand the basics of what was going on. Some of the decisions even after make no sense. Some people still wanting to leave the house, alone no less. This issue went away for the second half of the movie. Second. The characters lacked continuity and coherence. Laurie is supposedly the worst, a succubus, yet was a completely normal person for the most part. Then, completely out of character, she starts putting the moves on Kevin and kissing him? Kevin and Emily have a good relationship at the start but after one kiss and reminisce, he no longer cares about her? Just makes no sense. Third, there could have been a lot more done with the movie. The ending was good, but it doesn't seem like enough. The height of the drama was a couple of fights, some old sexual infidelity, the main character trying to kill and replace 'herself' in another universe, and an inappropriate kiss. The stakes could have been elevated and more continuous. My heart only started really pumping when Emily was trying to get rid of her clone, with 3 minutes left in the movie.Onto the good things.  The idea of the movie is incredible. The direction of the script was driven by the director giving each actor cards with their general direction, presumably for the specific scene or period in the film. The rest was filled in with improvisation and light direction. It makes for an incredibly authentic experience and a story that develops really naturally.It also has one of the most authentic processes of discovery imaginable. The actors are trying to figure out what's going on just as much as we the audience are, and that elevates the movie to an elite echelon of movies. The movie takes us down a maze and the experience just grows and grows and grows.This movie is excellent. Worth the watch, without a doubt."
