      "text": "The Founder, directed by John Lee Hancock and starring Michael Keaton, brings to life the story of Ray Kroc--the self-proclaimed founder of McDonald's.Keaton plays the part of Kroc with a manic sense of urgency, knowing he has gold on his hands and desperately wanting to make that gold-- specifically the golden arches--his own.  Casting directors often refer to an \u201cIt\u201d factor when it comes to actors, and whatever \u201cIt\u201d is, Michael Keaton has it.  He\u2019s as fascinating to watch in this film as ever.The direction of this film is well done but surprisingly it\u2019s the editing that stands out.  There are a number of times that the story needs to jump back and forth between the past and present or show the processes involved with running a busy restaurant and the editing is done both seamlessly and effectively.Unfortunately, it\u2019s mostly the writing that drags this picture out of any serious awards consideration, despite the Weinstein\u2019s doing everything in their power to position it so.  There\u2019s an adage in writing that says, \"show, don\u2019t tell.\u201d  There\u2019s also a ten-cent word for this called \"exposition,\" and The Founder is guilty of often explaining straightforward plot points instead of allowing audience members to figure it out on their own.In the end, Keaton\u2019s performance and the real-life story of Ray Kroc embody the spirit of American ambition, each driven by one of the most essential traits in business: persistence."

Inspiring because the film makers give you a glimpse into his turbo-charged \"how can I turn this into a huge opportunity\" mind, but also despicable because he goes for what he wants (a restaurant or someone's wife) with no regard to who gets hurt. In my opinion, the genius that quickly gets overlooked is the McDonald brother that developed the original fast burger system. He could have been the Walt Disney of fast food who's potential gets wasted by managing the original restaurant. Overall, well-crafted entertaining film!"

It's always true that a bio is not meant to be one hundred percent factual, but I didn't feel like it needed to demonize Ray Kroc any further than he may have done himself. I know what Hollywood feels about businessmen and all, but I find it formulaic and pushing an agenda I don't want to see almost all the time. And I mean those last three words. ALL. THE. TIME."

      "text": "\"The Founder\" stars Michael Keaton and Laura Dern. Directed by John Lee Hancock (\u201cThe Blind Side\u201d, \u201cSaving Mr. Banks\u201d) and written by Robert D. Siegel (\u201cThe Wrestler), the film tells the story of the beginning and evolution of the giant franchise operation known worldwide as \u201cMcDonalds\u201d. More to the point, it tells the story of a down on his luck salesman named Ray Kroc who by chance comes upon the hamburger and shakes stand owned and operated by the McDonald brothers (the real founders) and how he ultimately took their small enterprise and made it into one of the most well known and successful international food serving entities in history (and which, by estimate, is now serving approximately 1% of the world\u2019s population). Alas for poor Mr Keaton who always seems to be so much better than the movies in which he appears. This film falls into that category except for the fact that this is, after all,  the story of McDonalds and how one man was able to create this huge enterprise and make it the most powerful force in the franchise food industry. Add to that the always dependable quality performance of Mr. Keaton and the film\u2019s historical significance and it becomes a vehicle well worth viewing. I give the film a 7.5 rating with a reminder that if it wasn't telling the story of McDonalds, the film would  be more like a Big Mac with only the bun."

      "text": "A moviegoer enters a theatre with expectations whether it is seeing the star(s) or they have heard of the story line and, in some cases, who directed it. I walked in expecting a good performance by Michael Keaton and some of the more familiar names in the cast like Laura Dern and Patrick Wilson and not expecting much else. To my surprise, and delight, \u201cThe Founder\u201d was a much better film than I had anticipated.Based on a true story \u201cThe Founder\u201d is about Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton) who got control, many say stole, McDonald\u2019s from two brothers, Dick and Mac McDonald, (John Carroll and Nick Offerman). They started the change of American restaurants by introducing \u2018fast food\u2019 using fresh items in San Bernadino, California. The brothers had things down to a science, even in some cases inventing equipment, treated their employees like family and took pride in all aspects of the business.While the story focuses on the interaction between the two brothers and Kroc it is mainly about the latter. Did the brothers have a family life? You won\u2019t find out. We do meet Kroc\u2019s wife who spent most of her life supporting his schemes that never worked out and his secretary June (Kate Kneeland) who seemed to live in the office 24/7, along with some bankers, lawyers and investors.There is no doubting that Michael Keaton has a load of charm and gives an excellent performance but even he can\u2019t dispel the fact that Kroc didn\u2019t care for people caring only for \u2018the art of the deal\u2019. Yes, there are many resemblances between the two men even though this movie was made long before Trump even started running for business. Are all very successful, money making men, as ruthless to threaten business partners that they will sue them until they will lose financially or be buried in paperwork so high that they won\u2019t be able to take care of their business? Do these men not care about people and their families? As good as Keaton is he doesn\u2019t make you overcome the fact that Kroc was not a nice guy, a 'good guy'.All the actors mentioned plus Linda Cardellini as Patrick Wilson\u2019s wife, B.J. Novak as a financial adviser and assorted McDonald\u2019s employees all do what they can as the screenwriter, Robert Siegel, doesn\u2019t give them much time on screen. The brothers, as played by Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch, are as interesting as Keaton and more affable than the latter ever seemed to be. Is there room in the world today for people like the McDonald brothers?Using the new idiom of the day Kroc was known for \u2018alternate facts\u2019 regarding his life and as good as Keaton is he doesn\u2019t make you overcome the fact that Kroc was not a nice guy, a good guy.\u201cThe Founder\u201d is more than you expect it to be, not only from the actors, but little things like except for popular song sung in a restaurant I had to look up if there was even music in the movie! Director John Lee Hancock gives us a sunny USA pictorially even in the very down sequences where Kroc is being very much the \u2018businessman\u2019 and not like he is dealing with human beings.While it is a good movie and I would recommend it \u201cThe Founder\u201d is not a must see movie."

      "text": "A mesmerizing horror film, The Founder is the clearest depiction of modern day America ever put to film. While a clunky work, director John Lee Hancock's depiction of Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton) swooping in, stealing McDonald's from its rightful owners, passing it off as his own, screwing those brothers over, and then really sticking it to them to squash them entirely, The Founder plays out like a modern day depiction of capitalism. With the little guy getting screwed over in the name of corporate's bottom line, America has been plagued with this rapidly decreasing middle class while the rich only get richer. In this film, Hancock puts this on full display in a terrifying depiction of smart business practices at the expense of human kindness and empathy. Instead, it is win at all costs and allow the losers to bathe in a tub of their own blood.In an excellent performance, Keaton plays the hard working and hard-nosed shark that was Ray Kroc brilliantly. He is a dreamer who will stop at nothing to have everything he could ever hope to think about. From creating a multi-billion dollar corporation out of merely seeing the name \"McDonald's\" to leaving his wife after one glance of a new woman who captures his eye, nothing happens quickly for Kroc but it always happens. No matter what he does, he is always thinking twenty steps ahead and is clearly a brilliant businessman. While many of his ideas are handed to him, he builds them up and is able to capitalize on the ideas given to him. Sometimes, in life, it is not originality that reaps rewards. Rather, it is being willing and able to execute an idea, whether it is yours or not. Here, Kroc does exactly that and takes every idea over the goal line with brilliant precision and persistence. Unfortunately, in doing so, he tramples over everybody who gets in his way or he perceives as getting in his way even if they are just innocent bystanders.It is this negativity that creates the central conflict of The Founder. Ray Kroc may be a brilliant businessman, but he is a horrible husband and person to be in business with. He is cut throat and not afraid to let his eyes wander to new possibilities. Dick McDonald (Nick Offerman) realizes this quickly, but sticks with the deal because of the urging of Mac McDonald (John Carroll Lynch). Unfortunately, Kroc is a carnivore. He feeds on fresh meat and seeks to sink his teeth into whatever competition he can find. Turning on everybody in his life throughout the course of the film, The Founder is greatly negative towards its subject and is unafraid to extensively highlight the flaws in his character. No matter how smart he was and how much of a visionary he could be, it is impossible to ignore the fact that Ray Kroc was a mostly bad man who was unnecessarily cruel to everybody who did him wrong in his eyes.The part that does hold back The Founder, however, is a problem inherent in many biopics. Director John Lee Hancock is simply unable to blend his subject's professional life with his personal life. While showing many of the same traits in his personal life, especially with how he just dumps Ethel (Laura Dern) for a new wife when she offers him more in that moment, the film always seems to come to a halt. Compared to personal indulgences in films such as There Will Be Blood or The Social Network, both cited as influences on the work, The Founder is never able to make it gel. Thematically, they work, but for the film's pacing and plot it always feels like stomping on the breaks in favor of taking an undesirable detour. There is no flow or cohesion as a result of these scenes that just distract from the story of McDonald's being stolen from the brothers. Instead, it turns into too much backstory about Ray Kroc and not enough about the film's true victims. The scenes, especially Dern's Ethel, feel like filler and Hancock just checking off a box from the biopic formula checklist, instead of being a section of the film he is interested in at all. Had he been interested in exploring Ethel and Kroc's personal life, their divorce would have been more important and he would not have just jumped to him having married Joan (Linda Cardellini), who was actually his third wife, not his second. The film never actually embraces exploring Kroc's at home life to the point, which is a shame since it is in the film. Featuring an excellent performance from Michael Keaton in the central role, The Founder may not be 2016's The Social Network, but it is a terrifying exploration of the death of the middle class and rise to power of individuals with questionable morals. It indulges into Ray Kroc's personal life far too much to be sure, but its unflinching damnation of its central character and lack of fear in showing his negative qualities, makes the film a rarity in the biopic genre. A chilling, entertaining, compelling, and entirely revealing look behind the true story behind McDonald's, John Lee Hancock's The Founder is a very strong work."

      "text": "Veni, vidi, vici!I anticipated another inspiring biopic about a man who built an empire. That's partially true, because this was inspired by the right kind of wrong thing. I mean it was not actually about the McDonalds' story, the McDonald brothers, but the fast food chain McDonald, how the franchise got rapidly spread across the globe and the person behind it. With the film having both good and bad side, it stayed mostly neutral. But due to the main character, you would see too much lean on what seems the reason behind the McDonald's today's popularity.So it's like another typical American founders' story like Apple, Facebook. I mean not the one who found the company with all the hard works, but the one who dived in and took all the credit. Ray Kroc was a traveling salesman and he's not doing any good. But one day he meets the brothers who had started a modernised kitchen and its fast food service. He shows lots of interest in it and so he joins hands with them. With his new ideas, how he makes a fortune out of it and the future of the company, all revealed in the later part.An enjoyable film. Particularly for Michael Keaton. Well directed film as well. Film wise it was a good one, but the story wise not morally right. It was about the flaws in our society, our system. Some men can do anything like pulling others leg to climb the success ladder. It's not them to blame completely, because they had struggled enough to understand their future path. So definitely for some people, this film would inspire. If you are a regular McDonalds' customer, you should watch it. Otherwise, just to learn the truth, it is worth a watch.7/10"

      "text": "Having lived most of my life in Southern California, I had heard that McDonald's was started in San Bernardino by someone named McDonald.  But I had never heard the full story of Ray Kroc.  Michael Keaton was criminally overlooked in the Oscar nominations as the leading character.  He starts out sympathetic, a travelling salesman in his 50's who never quite made it, but hears that a restaurant named McDonald's ordered several milk shake making machines (which he sells) and decides to take a look at the restaurant himself.  The McDonald brothers are the inventors, who have tried to franchise their restaurant but were unsuccessful.  Kroc figures out how to do this, but along the way his determination turns to ambition and greed.  This is an interesting look at why the marketers, not the inventors, frequently succeed in our economy.  The McDonald brothers are the most sympathetic characters, but McDonald's would never have become what it is today without Kroc.This is also an interesting look at the young Joan Kroc, Ray's second wife, who is known to many San Diegans as the former owner of the Padres, patron of the arts, and philanthropist."

Despite some noticeable narrative gaps that hurt the flow of the story, on balance, this well-made biopic serves up some tasty morsels about the back story behind the growth of this multinational food service behemoth. Some of the critical observations that have been leveled against this release are noteworthy and insightful, but others lack credibility by complaining that the picture hasn't made grander, overarching statements about the nature of contemporary American business, objectives that it was clearly not designed nor intended to do. Don't expect a gourmet meal from this one, but do enjoy the satisfying snack it provides."

His character is smooth, hate-able, and extremely interesting in this movie, and really ties the film together. The other actors are all pretty good. The plot is interesting, and some of the shots are pretty good and memorable. \"The Founder\" is a really entertaining docu-drama that I highly recommend to anyone."

      "text": "The Founder (2016) is an exquisite biographical drama film based on the true story of the American businessperson- Ray Kroc, the one who started the world's most renowned fast food chain: McDonald's. With a flawless screenplay crafted by Robert Siegel and under the powerful creative director- John Lee Hancock, this movie stands out as one of its kind. The film premiered at ArcLight Hollywood earning well deserved critical acclaim that also heavily lauded Michael Keaton's authentic performance as Ray Kroc.The story wonderfully depicts the events that occur in his life that shape the course of his career ahead as he rises from a door-to-door salesman to become the owner of McDonald's. Thrown into complex situational dilemmas, Ray is compelled to take decisions that have heavy long lasting impacts both on his job and in his personal life. Unable to suppress his extraordinary ambition and passion for the business, he tirelessly chases his dream of expanding McDonald's from a small neighborhood restaurant in San Bernardino into a nation wide franchise.His dedication starts to pay-off when he is credited with enormous fame in the Mid-West and expands horizons to the East Coast. The ever growing business not only profits in millions of dollars, but also multiplies job opportunities for people manifold. Overnight, his success takes America by storm and the whole country starts to look up to him as an inspirational icon.However this hungry pursuit of his goal, takes a gradual heavy toll on his ethical self. It heartlessly tears down his relationship with his own wife and his trusting friendship with the original founder brothers of McDonald's. The new paths he voluntarily charters to expand his restaurant business even directly contradict the core humane values on which McDonald's was originally built. But none of this casts a genuine impact on his life, which has now come to be solely defined by his financial ambitions. Ray refuses to stop at anything until he fulfills his life-long dream.As the film plays to a close, Ray's sheer persistence pushes his company through several tough and uncertain years, ultimately successfully establishing itself as the world's largest food chain. This mannerism of his proved to be an asset for his huge company, but it also came at the cost of completely devastating the lives of a few others. On the outside, this easily spells out as a bright success story of hard work and persistence over fear. But it also revolves around a much darker internal theme, that we don't fully realize until the bitter-sweet ending when Ray reflects back on his life to prepare for a press interview.The amazing cinematography adopted creates a deeper effect in our minds by making us feel the revealing story beats along with the characters themselves. Also the intentional use of brighter color tones of certain scenes is done to synchronize with the iconic vibrant colors of McDonald's. Laura Dern, Nick Offerman, John Lynch, Linda Cardellini and the rest of the talented cast play out their supporting roles perfectly.This film accurately establishes Ray both as a triumphant human being and as a selfish business tycoon, leaving the rest to the audience's judgement. A definite parallelism between the lives of Ray Kroc and Mark Zuckerberg (in 2010 film Social Network) goes unnoticed. And as the end credits roll over, we are left to ponder on the price of extraordinary success and its worth."
