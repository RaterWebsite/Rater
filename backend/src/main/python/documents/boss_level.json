Pretty good acting from a muscle bound stud whom I don't even know if I've seen in any other movies before, but he was perfect for the role.  Nonstop action and it is definitely not b rated film making."

      "text": "I am a sucker for these Time loop movies. So when I heard there was an R rated action time loop movie, I was already sold. The premise is simple \"A retired military operative finds himself in a never-ending time loop on the day of his death\". So is this a fun entry in the genre or a loop you're going to forget?Firstly, I like the premise and idea behind it. Revenge stories aren't rare and stories, where the main character is hunted by assassins, isn't rare either. A time loop story containing both of these is relatively unique though and it makes you wonder why it wasn't done earlier. I also really like the video game motif of Boss Level (2021). Throughout, the movie it is frame like a video game with attempt numbers and him trying to memorize all the timings. It makes it quite fun as we go along with him as he learns more in each attempt. Although, the story isn't told linearly as when it begins he is already on over 100 attempts. There will be a lot of scenes referring to previous attempts before going back to the present attempt but this is never jarring in any way and is handled fine.Due to the R rating, we get some great violent scenes such as seeing our main character, Roy Pulver played magnificently by Frank Grillo, get decapitated or shot multiple times or even blown up. There are very fun deaths in Boss Level. There are also some high energy and cartoony action sequences from a pretty ridiculous car chase, shoot-outs and even a sword fight that are an absolute blast to watch. I also really enjoyed the dark humour such as our main lead getting annoyed with certain ways of dying since it takes too long. While there is a lot of chaotic fun throughout, there is also some heart in the story. Roy Pulver does get a character arc and there are some sweet moments between Roy and his family. The writer and director utilized the time loop idea effectively for a key part of the story and funny moments. However, for a movie that is only 100 minutes, it is baffling that there are so many parts where the pacing slows to a downhill. After an amazing 10 minute intro, it then decides to do the entire flashback right after and it lasts WAY too long. Every scene concerning Jemma Wells (Naomi Watts), Roy's wife, is just very boring to watch and this isn't down to Naomi's performance or anything. It's because the scene is meant to give one important info but is dragged by meaningless dialogue that is just padding the run time. Another example is a monologue from the villain Clive Ventor (Mel Gibson) about some snake just to amount to \"don't bring visitors Jemma okay?\". Going from high energy action scenes to these slow-paced talking scenes brings the movie to a standstill, especially if the talking scenes don't have enough significant or emotional impact. Unfortunately, the pacing doesn't just drop at the beginning but also drops at the ending which goes on for a bit too long as well.I'm also disappointed in how Mel Gibson and Michelle Yeoh are used in the movie. They are both amazing actors but are just not in the movie a lot. Mel Gibson plays the main villain but we don't see him do much apart from just monologuing for a long time. Michelle Yeoh is on the poster which seems to signify an important character but she is nothing more than a 1-minute cameo. I wish there was more conflict between the main character and the main villain but they won't interact that much. Some dialogue isn't that great eitherOverall, I had a lot of fun with Boss Level (2021). It doesn't blow you away in the action department or do something never seen before. However, it is very high octane energy and chaotic which honestly is incredibly satisfying to watch."

      "text": "Boss Level is a new addition to the time loop genre, with a twist. Ex-special forces officer, Roy Pulver, played by Frank Grillo, relives the same day until he dies. Every day he is hunted by assassins and when killed, he wakes up back in his bed where he started, only to have to try and survive all over again. Roy has no idea why he is stuck in this infinite time loop but he must do what he can to survive, and the longer he survives, the more he uncovers about his particular situation. Unlike most action films that take time to build up, this film gets right into it and offers tons of non-stop combat sequences that would satisfy any lover of action films. Its erratic flow makes for some fun action scenes which come out of nowhere since Roy can expect the assassins to attack at any moment. If you play video games often and have ever been stuck on a level for hours or even days, you know the feeling of having to repeat the same thing over and over again until you finally figure out how to pass the level easily the next time. Boss Level pays homage to this as Roy moves further in time after many attempts to beat a person or try to gather more information on how to solve a dilemma. The assassins are a really fun part of the film and help add a nice range of action that constantly feels fresh. I can sense the enjoyment the creative team had when creating each assassin. Every one of them has a particular set of skills, represents a different style of fighting, and has a unique costume to fit their overall esthetic. They also each represent many tropes found in video games. For example, one of the bosses is a carbon copy of Roy played by actor Eric Etebari. Their encounters are hilarious as they both are constantly dressing alike and put up a consistent fight. One of my favorite assassins was named Guan Yin, played by Selina Lo. She is this bad-ass sword fighter who gives Roy a run for his money. I must add, she was equally funny and her signature catchphrase was a nice added touch that had me laughing each time. It made me think of many famous catchphrases like \"get over here\" from Street Fighter. Guan Yin wasn't the only funny character, the film also boasts the comedic power of Will Sasso and Ken Jeong and offers many hilarious bits in their unique style. The uniqueness doesn't stop there as the films acting range includes Mel Gibson, Naomi Watts, Michelle Yeoh, Rampage Jackson, and the double touchdown scoring Rob Gronkowski from this year's Super Bowl. I was pleasantly surprised for the film to have such a warm and enjoyable side plot that saw Roy rekindle his relationship with his son, Joe. As the two bonded over video games like Street Fighter and Defender, it gave the film a nice even buffer in between the action sequences, as Roy progressed through the game. Fun fact, Joe, played by Rio Grillo, is Frank Grillo's son. Many of these scenes show us the leading man that Frank Grillo is. and the dynamic range he has which is only starting to shine through in his latest roles.I was first introduced to Joe Carnahan's work from Smokin' Aces and have been following his work ever since. His balls to the wall action style and fast-paced filmmaking fit the time loop genre well. That is one of the reasons why Boss Level worked so well. He also has a great relationship with Frank Grillo after working on many projects together over the years. Boss Level is a really fun action flick that does not take itself too seriously and pays homage to action films and video games in really awesome ways.I am Stefano Bove, and I have written this! If this joke does not make sense, watch the film and come talk :)"
