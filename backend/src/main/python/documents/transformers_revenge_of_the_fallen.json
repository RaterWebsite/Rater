There is simply nothing to redeem this film. Where do I begin to describe how thoroughly unpleasant an experience it was to watch this movie! From the very beginning one of the biggest problems is Bays inability to keep the camera static for even a second. The worst example of this is in a scene early on in the movie in which Sam and Mikaela are stood talking to each other in a romantic embrace, this had potential to be a romantic and engaging moment in an otherwise emotionally barren film, however Bay has the camera doing 360 degree whirls all over the place, completely ruining the moment.

Overlong, under-plotted, no character development, and the fight scenes were shot badly. Predictable, not even a little bit fun. Only humor was racial stereotyped robots. That got old fast.

Went because my son wanted to see it on IMAX. Sorry I spent any money on it. No thought required, just excessive overly crafted CGI battle after battle. Loud, obnoxious, pointless. The acting was extremely poor, the story almost impossible to ascertain, the jokes were very tasteless and near racially offensive. As someone who grew up with Transformers during my youth, all I can say is Bay's interpretation of the franchise is a complete travesty. Is this the future of \"blockbusters\"? Films where you pay $10 to shut off your brain at the door and go \"oo, pretty lights\" for two and a half hours?

And put him in everyone's action nostalgia movie. In which he just waters down all the good qualities that this movie can have... Say Transformers.

My biggest problem with the movie is the overplayed humping jokes, references to the male genitiles, and language. I would not take a kid under 13 to this movie however plenty of parents brought their 5 and 6 year olds. It disturbing to hear a 4 year old kid laugh at robots calling each other and humans b**ch, using the word p*ssy, and s*it.

It is part of a genre to be considered as the inverse of art-house cinema: it's not really made for those who \"don't get it.\"The movie outweighs its predecessor in terms of CGI action, which it is made to solely be. It is a movie about toys kids used to play with, this should be seen as some sort of ultra-high budget continuation of the original TV series intended for the children of this decade, only its film format makes it accessible for adults - and pure candy for the grown-ups who played with the toys.A demoscene could have sufficed to showcase the action sequences.

When it comes to a Transformers' movie, that's kind of all it takes to make a sequel work.  What idiot is seriously going to be super-upset that the characters lacked depth?  Dude, you're watching a movie about things going boom because big robots that turn into trucks and shoot plasma cannons while talking with James Earl Jones' voices have come to Earth to befriend and protect or enslave us all... Things going boom is the point of the movie.  How can you give it a bad rating when it does exactly what it's supposed to do.  Things went boom.  A lot.  In all kinds of different ways.  It was pretty cool watching things go boom.

From the beginning it was tense and everything was unexpected. I also really enjoyed the special effects because they were very realistic and the fight scenes between the Transformers were done really carefully. The Transformers that were shown in this movie and didn't appear in the original were very amusing. I liked almost everything in this movie but the acting.. Megan Fox didn't give herself to the plot and didn't act as well in the first movie. I liked Shia's performance but the constant noise in the movie didn't really go as well as they taught it would.. After all, I'm still happy there will be a third movie!"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "pretty cool movie. i like most of Michael Bay's movies and the transformer series.

There are more explosions and battles. But the plot as it was not so and not. And the second time this is not so impressive. Delirium in history has become even more.

Adding even more explosions is unlikely to satisfy viewers over 14 years old."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "I really wanted to like this movie just like the first one, but unfortunately it's very boring & there are so many dumb jokes. There is some action in some parts I guess, but most of the time it's just uninteresting dialogue, as if the movie doesn't take itself seriously. The only good thing about this movie is Megan Fox."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Let me start off by saying I've enjoyed the first for what it was but most of this film made me literally angry, it was so fucking shit. The dialogue/ characters was disastrous, Uwe Boll looks like a genius next to this fucking moron and 90% of the time in the fighting scenes I couldn't even tell WHY there were explosions and it just seemed like a shit load of metal sounds. It's also odd how the robots acted so much like humans in the way they fight/ act/ talk. I didn't pick up on that the first film but I did here, probably because there is much more dialogue scenes and so on which were NOT needed and yeah, just literally pissed me off over how dumb they were. Oh and when an old robot is re-activated he has a beard and a walking cane WHAT THE FUCK!? Fucking ridiculous movie that highlights everything wrong with American culture. The mom character especially. oh.my.fucking.god, she was so fucking terrible, I just wanted to stick a chainsaw in someone's eye. And no you can't say \"lol just go in it and have some fun\", that WAS my attitude before it started pissing me off with scene after scene of absurd idiocy. The humour pisses me off just thinking about it...When the dad slaps the mother's ass, the main douchebag guy says \"hey watch it, this isn't a rap video\"....Yeah...wow. And the way he says it adds to the annoyance. The effects were spectacular, I'd give it that. I loved when robots got sliced you could literally see very inch of metal, wires and whatever come apart and that was about all I've enjoyed along with some of the action scenes. And the overall story was kind of interesting if it was told better but it wasn't and unfortunately the great story that seemed to be in there just couldn't come out under such retarded direction which is a huge shame. 2/10."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "\"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen\" lacks the mind-blowing blockbuster spirit \"Transformers\" originally had.

Not only because it's a million kinds of awful, but because of what it represents.

It never ends with the and badly edited action scenes full of clunky-CGI , and the terrible humor, the incomprehensible plot, and the shallow characters both human and robot that I could never care much about. It goes on and on and on, and was overstaying it's welcome for me at about the hour mark. There are few amusing moments, some sparks of a decent special effects scene, but for the most part it's just a bunch mindless dribble that serves no purpose I can think of, not even on the basic level of entertainment for anyone above the age of 14 or so."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Frankly, how bad could it be? Critics rip it to shreds, calling dumb, loud, and stupid, but it's a movie about giant robots smashing each other, so what did you expect? I expect Michael Bay to acknowledge that humans traditionally have brains. That's the problem with Transformers 2. You can complain all you want about the racist robots, the lame dialogue, the annoying human characters, and overstuffed action sequences, but it all comes down to one central problem. Yes, we all expected Transformers 2 to be loud, dumb, and stupid. The problem is that it is simply TOO loud, dumb, and stupid. It is loud, dumb, and stupid to the degree that it actually feels insulting as you watch it. The anger that possessed me during Transformers 2 was almost too much to bear.

Es mala, muy mala en cuanto al gui\u00f3n, desarrollo de los personajes, se saca cosas de la manga cada veinte minutos.

Muy muy muy entretenida las 2 horas y media se pasan como 1h y 20 minutos, y por lo tanto, lo que yo espero de esta pel\u00edcula me lo da con creces y la valoro por lo que \"espero - me da\" que es DIVERSI\u00d3N a raudales."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Just as good as the original.
