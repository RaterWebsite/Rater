An all-star ensemble delivers one of the better and more captivating superhero movie in recent time, despite the use of a rather mystifying time travel plot. They do a remarkable job of keeping the audience invested to the characters, each with brimming personality to ensure there's never a dull moment. Visually, the movie is captivating, its contrast tone bridges the colorful 70s and severely bleak future impeccably. It also appropriately utilizes good humor throughout the seemingly melancholy plot.\r X-Men: Days of Future Past is an ambitious movie, it brings the newer cast from First Class as well as the older trilogy, plus Hugh Jackman. The time traveling gimmick could be a puzzling one, and in some occasions there are tricky twists that rely on heavy expositions. However, the movie pulls it off quite neatly with balanced pacing. The complexity doesn't divert the focus away from relationship of characters, most of which are always in peril. Many of the cast are capable to lead a movie by their own, but the movie doesn't feel bloated because they are so many involved. Director Bryan Singer cleverly seams the characters' tales together; the present chemistry produces engaging interaction between them.\r The bulk of the story occurs in 1973, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender and Jennifer Lawrence take most of the spotlight. They perform admirably, each showcasing emotional baggage and entwined history together. Hugh Jackman fits into the party fairly well, he has been Wolverine for so long, he just naturally meshes together with the younger X-Men. Peter Dinklage provides a unique antagonist. X-Men movies are notoriously filled with military men as villains, it's nice to see someone more dynamic and with less reliance to violence.\r Effects are done beautifully. The future battles are spectacular, not to mention the choreography gracefully combines the mutants' power into the fray. I personally like the intricacy of Blink's ability which allows her to use multiple portals. Her scenes are few, but very well done. The slow motion effect looks wonderful and melee combat is performed effectively, especially Mystique's acrobatic dances. There's lingering retro ambiance for 70s, a simple touch of familiarity. One minor blemish is the lighting for future setting might be a tad too dark at times to fully appreciate the graphic.\r The prevalent flaw of time travel gimmick is the impact actions supposedly have on the future, this movie is no exception. There are a few instances where characters act rather brashly just in case it may hopefully change the future, a couple decisions are questionable as well, it's hard to believe experienced mutants with special powers would do impulsive action. It also tries to add prejudice theme, but seeing Jennifer Lawrence, even with blue skin, having self-confident issue is like seeing a supermodel complaining she's fat. All the flaws are just little hindrance, they barely affect the gripping performance of the talents.\r X-Men: Days of Future Past is arguably the best of the franchise, it will entertain viewers with exquisite acting, finely pace story and delightfully likeable characters."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This is the best X-Men movie so far, the story is great, the cast is incredible, the action scenes are amazing.

It has everything. Just watch it. Great characters and the most intriguing plot. One of the best films of this year and surely the best Marvel film. Watch it !"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "I'm gonna be a little too honest here: I bingewatched all the X-Men movies, so I often forget about this movie. Many times I get confused when someone mentions a scene from this movie, and I'm like, \"wait, it happened in THIS movie? I thought it happened in First Class/Apocalypse!\" And I'd prefer admitting that it's my fault than it being the movie's fault.X-Men: Days of the Future Past is what I'd call the movie that bridges X-Men: First Class with the other canonical movies, and at the same time also helps in eliminating the bad movies like The Last Stand and Origins. The movie begins with, as usual, mutants being attacked and eliminated. So to save all of them, Wolverine goes back in time and stop Mystique from killing Bolivar Trask, a defence contractor. Wolverine reached the 1970s, when he was still a mutant without vibranium. And to set planes in motion, he has to find Charlex Xavier, Magneto, Beast and Mystique.Bolivar Trask used Mystique's powers to create Mutant Hunting Robots. In the beginning they were only meant to be used to fight in the Vietnam war, but seeing how Mystique and Magneto revealed themselves, they decided to use the robots to hunt down the mutants itself. They didn't see whether mutants are also sentient beings or not, they just wanted to have them eliminated. And that's when the roles of money and power play. It was on the order of President Nixon that Bolivar decided to make those robots, which President Nixon had ordered only because of Bolivar's influence. So in a way it was a loop of blame.And when Professor X, Wolverine and Quicksilver reach Magneto to save him, we finally get to see the fabled Quicksilver scene, where he takes down all the prison guards single handedly. It was the most iconic moment from the movie, and no amount of appreciation can praise it as much as it deserves. The modern day scenes were also adding to the tension, and in the end when Mystique is left with the choice whether to kill Bolivar or not, it is a quite tense moment whether the mutants in the modern time will survive or not. In the end we see that all the mutants who had died in the previous movies had also come back to life, and the franchise was brought back to where Bryan Singer had left it in X2.Normally it is very difficult to reboot a franchise (read Sonic 06). Not only do you have to understant the major events that need to ve removed in order to fix the franchise, you also have to make the reboot-turning movie really good, otherwise it will just contribute to being the hot garbage that the other movies of the franchise are. And that's the reason why I believe this movie is underrated.

It deserves to be one of the most iconic X-Men movies."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "The best part of the franchise in my view: The movie shows a loft of conflicts of the x-men and make the characters deep and interesting.

It was just so cool to watch him in action. But if he had stuck around for the rest of the film, it would be too easy.\r Great ending as well - we get to see all the changes in the timeline, and showing Jean and Scott as a small tribute and connection to the original X-men trilogy was nice. But most importantly, the older timeline is still remembered by Logan; so the previous timeline we saw still holds some meaning.\r The good: Great humor - especially with Wolverine. Great action. The young versions of the heroes were handled very well - like making Young Charles a drunk / druggie, so he has something to overcome if he wants to save the mutants. They did a good job with building the characters of the three key heroes - Mystique, Xavier, and Magneto. The chemistry between Fassbender and McAvoy was great just like in \"X-men: First Class\", and I liked how even though they reconcile, Magneto still decides to do things his own way and act as the villain.\r The bad: very formulaic story with tons of exposition. Like Young Charles not wanting to help Logan and then agreeing after a 10 second shot of Raven's picture. Or the X-men in real time being attacked right when Logan is about to succeed in his mission. The plot was incredibly predictable and everything is done by the Hollywood formula. Also, some of the character decisions (primarily Magneto) were pretty stupid - if he had just talked to Mystique after they stopped the assassination, there would be no point for the escalation that followed.\r Overall though a very solid entry in the superhero genre and the X-men series."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "X-Men: Days of Future Past is the best X-Men movie to date, and it totally broke my expectations!\r This new X-Men movie is so incredible, there\u2019s so much unique and awesome things that blew my mind of when I saw this film.

They are pumping out movies nonstop, and in return, money is raining on their heads. Heck, they're now the highest grossing movie franchise EVER now!

Guess what? X-Men Days of Future Past is just like the other Marvel films in terms of quality, if not better! At the core of every Marvel movie, their true genre is action. One-on-one fight scenes with hero and villain, countless numbers of structures falling down, explosions (not to a Michael Bay degree though), it's awesome action. So of course, DoFP has amazing action with all the X-Men. I loved seeing their mutant powers come to life and then watching in awe as they kicked ass. Speaking of the characters and their powers, all of them are truly brought to life. While the acting is nothing revolutionary, everybody still does a fine job. I especially liked Michael Fassbender's performance as Magneto. He really acts like a menace sometimes (which he will do more than often in the movie), and there's not a better pick for a character that's supposed to be cruel than him. The title of the movie gives you some hints about the storyline, right? Well, what happens is that the world is getting eaten up by the Sentinels, and they are still trying to kill every mutant they can find. The X-Men soon figure out someone must go into the past with Kitty's powers to change what happened. I will not lie, you will have to pay attention most of the time. It wasn't a problem for me, though. While it's not the most original Marvel storyline you've ever heard, it's still interesting enough to keep you entertained. In terms of flaws, I really couldn't detect any. Does that mean it's a 10 out of 10 masterpiece (12 Years a Slave is considered that score imo)?

Best superhero flick of the summer - not a tough task."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "In every level this movie has been the most complete marvel movie ever if not the greatest: The scenario is saturated with events that does not seem to distract you away from the main plot, we have a justified and well portrayed villain (magneto) which is non-existant in the marvel universe (except loki who might and probably should be considered as an anti hero after thor 2). I also do not know any other marvel movie that keeps this many characters and does not give you the feeling of the movie is overcrowded with too many shallow characters. The movie is emotional; not in a very dramatic way but it is able capture its thematic emotion: \"Hope\" because you get to feel some of the characters' feelings of desperation and their path of self destruction, you also get to see that this may fail no matter what you do but at the end hope wins and you get to experience this effectively due to great performances of the main characters."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Best X-men yet. An intriguing plot, likable characters, awesome action and a small dose of humor make this the best flick of the summer so far. The acting was terrific, with great performances from Michael Fassbender, James McAvoy, Hugh Jackman, Peter Dinklage and Evan Peters. Speaking of Peters, Quicksilver was a big surprise and the highlight of the movie, eliminating all earlier complaints about his design. DOFP leaves a tough act to follow for the rest of the summer.

Very entertaining, wonderfully done and was a great way to mix together the two cast. Love it and loved the ending."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Marvel is really on top of their film game, with a great Captain America, a decent Spiderman, and now a truly excellent X-Men, all in the same few months.  And if you think about it, they are veritably ruling the film world.  Look at the ensemble of actors in this movie.  Where other than a Robert Altman movie are you going to find a cast of people together like Ian McKellan, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Jennifer Lawrence, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Ellen Page - the list goes on and on.  What's more remarkable is that this cast works deftly together in a film that could have been a sloppy disaster.  Time-travel movies when done right are some of the most intriguing movies ever - but if done wrong, they are excruciating.  Luckily, Days of Future Past gets it all right, and the only drawback is all the expository, supporting dialogue the audience must therefore endure along the way in order to understand it.  The bad guys in this movie are truly bad.  If the Sentinels show up, they are going to kill you, and this is established right away in one of the most exciting superhero/villain fight scenes in any comic book movie to date.  Seeing Colossus become full metal at the same time Sunspot flames on at the same time Iceman (finally) goes and stays full Iceman - a very cool moment.  Unfortunately even these powerhouses are no match for the Sentinels.  The only option is for newly-introduced (but now regular X-Man) Blink to keep them moving around until Shadowcat (with a future developed time/spirit manipulation power) can send newly-introduced Bishop just far enough into the past to warn the team that the Sentinels are approaching - so they can not be there when the Sents arrive.  This is layer one.  Layer two then is this first group combining efforts with the other group (Storm, Wolverine, Prof. X, Magneto) to send someone way back in time to before the Sentinels were even created.  This task falls to Wolverine and off he goes into the second layer (the 1970s, pre-Sentinels) in an effort to stop Mystique from.... wow.  The more I write the more I realize how convoluted this plot is.  It's like trying to explain to a non-viewer what's going on in Game of Thrones.  Pretty soon you just throw your hands up and say, \"You know what?  Just watch it!\"  And so that's what I'll do.  What works in this film is the excellent acting, the dark plot, the nearly-full roster of Superheroes, and the best scene in an X-Men movie since Nightcrawler's debut in X2 (hint:  Quicksilver, and anyone dealing with a Quicksilver or Flash-type character in the future must now contend with this scene setting a certain bar for excellence).  There are a few disappointments.  Anna Paquin will show up as Rogue for a second at the end, and I understand her deleted scene(s) will make it onto a DVD/Bluray version.  But for this primary showing, she's notably and confusingly completely absent.  The action scenes in this movie range from the terrifying Sentinel attacks to the now-typical \"huge Magneto scene\" - this time with him moving an entire sports stadium, to a lot of smaller scenes spread throughout - and they all work.  The special effects are fantastic and nothing feels gratuitous (except when they are going for 100% gratuitous, as in the Quicksilver scene).  The story holds together and the dialogue, while mostly expository, is good.  It's my personal favorite of the series so far (you might be surprised to know that The Last Stand was my favorite until now - typically the one everyone hates - but I'm a sucker for new heroes and villains showing up, and X3 brought a lot of new faces into the series - even if Juggernaut was a huge letdown - the Phoenix climax was epic).  Days of Future Past ups the ante on everything and makes me hungry for the next installment.  I think they're being smart with this series - phasing some actors out and others in - because this bodes well for this being a series with a real lifespan well beyond where we're at now.  If you're new to the series, by all means don't start with this one.  Start at the beginning.  But if you're already an X-Fan, you're most likely going to love this movie."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "I love science fiction and I hate superheroes, but I credit the X-Men series with giving me an appreciation for them. X-Men has showed me that in the proper context, with some great writers, superheroes movies don't have to be the lowest form of sci-fi entertainment. Days of Future Past seemed to confuse some people, as it's not part of the trilogy and therefore it's timeline is off. The ending of the film also creates a paradox, which eliminates certain mistakes made in the other films. In layman's terms, some of the things that happen in the other X-Men movies, never happen, because of Days of Future Past. In an undetermined era, sometime between the end of the original film and Last Stand, a new enemy has been targeting mutants. These machines, meant to eliminate the mutants have malfunctioned and are now targeting humans as well. The machines are made with mutant DNA and therefore have the combined forces of all the mutants it's come in contact with, making them unstoppable. The only chance the X-Men have is for one of them to go back in time and stop the machines from ever being built. Wolverine is the only one with a mind strong enough to survive the trip and is sent back to the 1970s, where he meets the cast of X-Men: First Class. While difficult for non-sci-fi aficionados to understand, this film was not only extremely well written, but serves dual purposes for the series. First, it brings both casts together in an extreme fashion and it's a tremendous gift for the fans. Second, it allows the writers to undo mistakes from The Last Stand, which was at the time, set to be the final X-Men film. The ending to Days of Future Past, effectively explain that everything that happened in Last Stand, never happened, as it was part of an alternate timeline. This allows the writers to bring back characters like Prof. X (who is seen killed in that film) for possible future films. It really was an ingenious move for the franchises future, but it also allowed fans to experience the \"old timers\" and the \"new class\" working together, in a huge, diverse, and very impressive cast. Seldom are superheroes films so complicated or as well written as Days of Future Past. The writing is out of this world, the cast is full of stars, and the special effects were absolutely amazing. Love it or hate it, superheroes are part of the science fiction genre, but Days of Future Past was simply incredible and for that, it's our latest must see movie!"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Even better than its already impressive predecessor, Days of Future Past is definitely Singer in top form - whether its the deft handling of the ensemble cast, sleek visuals or inherently humane story.
