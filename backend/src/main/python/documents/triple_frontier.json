Silly decisions and terrible tactical maneuvers for so called professionals who get outflanked by a villager with a hunting rifle.  The multiple problems they encounter are necessary I suppose to create conflict for the plot, but they are mostly contrived.  Just an average military \"thriller\"."

      "text": "I was convinced to see Triple Frontier after I saw the big posters scattered around my city. I had high expectations and I was not disappointed. I was really expecting a big action movie (maybe a classical \"commando against narcos\"), but it's more of a classical heist movie and a great one. The first half of the movie is really good: good characters' introductions, everyone with their own specialties, and pretty decent action scenes. The second half is a little more slow but pretty intriguing. It reminds me of an old-fashioned movie, solid, with fast pace, intense and thoughtful. It begins with the action, and then switch to an adventure film, to get to the drama and to end up in the action again. The performance of the entire cast is on point, especially Charlie Hunnam and Garrett Hedlund. The introduction of the character of Oscar Isaac is perfect. The character played by Ben Affleck could be difficult to understand at first. He was supposly the most expert and rational one, he turns out to be the most unprofessional. But it's an interesting and unespected character development. The plot (and the screenplay) could have been more courageous and focus more on the greed and on the \"good guys turn bad\" theme, but it's still a breath of fresh air in nowadays' movie scene. It's really a surprise coming from a Netflix's production. It also has an excellent photography and soundtrack. I really enjoy it. Absolutely recommended, 8/10."

      "text": "The Survival Spirit Sparkles Up The Hunt.Triple FrontierChandor is sticking his neck out here. He is shifting on another genre; primarily action, that has never been his forte. And usually it is hard to pull it off, but he has been exploring the borderline issues like such. This is why the action is crisp clean. With a meticulous thorough exploration of a well mapped out and choreographed action sequence, the film starts off with a typical \"in and out\" mission- or so you'd think. The first act that starts smoothly, is your usually convincing 1-0-1 writing method. This is what aches you throughout the course of the film, J. C. Chandor, the co-writer and director, pleads you to go through the whole process that frankly at times might be moot.Like, the first act, where the baggage of all the character comes up with, is your expected hokum of unsatisfactory that would help them shake on this dodgy deal proposed by Pope (Oscar Isaac). After which the film and the characters strikes on their main target, where all the credit goes to Chandor and his execution on creating a tense environment among these characters as they go- almost without any proper preparations- in and finds themselves fighting with each other.Their experience and the build up of their hype of being excellent in their training and work, is perpetually justified when all their aim is directed toward an outer threat. These little things is how Mark Boal- the creator- convinces you to be invested in this group. But all this razzle dazzle barely changes any dime in the game, the crux of the film lies on the aftermath of this mission. Despite of all the training and the experience these buffed up retired military boys have been through, what's fascinating is how easily seduced they are.This fine analysation of human behavior- something that we have earlier seen in Steven Spielberg's Indiana Jones The Last Crusader- is what sparks up viewer's attention. The bickering and smooth familiar slangs used among them is smart of them to keep it alive, the team is left no more a team in its last act, when these characters finally go three dimensional. Isaac, as arguably the leader and schemer of the whole project has done a great work especially when it comes to strike horns head to head with Ben Affleck that is kept under the shades along with other team members.And hence is the reason why Affleck stands alone as he is- against all odds- trying to figure out the math behind the distraction Isaac has constructed. Pedro Pascal, Charlie Hunnam (as the reserved one) and Garrett Hedlund (the hothead and amateur one), unfortunately doesn't have much to offer on terms of the performance. The only major asset of the film is its surprised package, call it the second half or the last act, these macho guys tested by the nature is what justifies the storytelling. Triple Frontier works a marvel as a morality lesson for kids out there, but then they should think about everyone, especially if it dares to go that dark that quick."

I think these actions were forced by writer because he/she wanted plot to go in certain directions, in order to not be classified as another, predictable, formulaic, action movie; it left me with a feeling of being conned to a great extent and I lost interest in what happened to the main characters. Great idea, but handled in a very superficial and immature manner where problems kept appearing and often were self-imposed whenever particular plot twists were needed. The movie-going public has been overwhelmed for decades now with 'former, special ops, buddy' movies where main characters are getting back together for one last big operation. Disappointed in final result for it felt like watching a video game."

Then the writers have the main characters flip from good to bad and back again, in a sickening series of 180s that leaves you wondering who would think this is at all plausible.  The cinematography may be good, as are three of the performances, but with a mediocre script and directing this is hitting the new average for Netfix movies unfortunately.  I was really hoping with this cast that it would live up to the hype from the early reviewers handing out good scores, but clearly they were watching a different movie."

SPOILER: The only thing that annoyed me was how these guys were professionals, but did not account for the weight of the cargo.

The plot is mildly interesting, the originality relies on the characters but then the film has to be successful in making the audience like these characters, which I do not think they have really achieved in full. Mainly by a significantly poor performance by one individual who thankfully doesn't pollute this movie in its entirety, one who ruined a highly respected and successful franchise who in this film tried to ruin a whole genre and whose career seems dedicated to the regression of acting. I will no longer give this actor another chance to waste my time. If you want to watch a film with a cast that is mostly skilled and also has a good script and budget then this isn't bad at all. Credit should be given to Netflix for this film given its inconsistency."

How we go from supposedly crack unit of soldiers pulling off a heist, only to then change into utter morons that are mega greedy and seem to have lost any ounce of common sense is beyond me. It goes with the usual clich\u00e9s for this genre: \"If it can go wrong, it will go wrong\" + \"crime does not pay\". And to top it all off at the end, they did what they should have in the first few hours of running with the money. i.e. Hide some of it somewhere only they knew about and could go back for later. Which would have made the helicopter ride to freedom and riches much more believable. But no apparently these super talented soldiers would rather crash, trek through the jungle, kill various other people or die as a result of said killing and  apparently never eat and have arguments with each other whilst pissing away everything they stole in various stupid scenarios."

The positives are that Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnam, and Garrett Hedlund do an excellent job in convincing me that they were once brothers in arms and that they are hardened badasses. It is more serious than I was expecting but that doesn't take away from this film as an enjoyable action experience. A negative I had with this movie is that there wasn't a whole lot of great action scenes. When they happened it was enjoyable and shot really well, but then the movie slows down a lot and it never really feels like this Cartel is after them.Overall I think this is a good movie with great performances, and I would definitely recommend checking it out."

I feel that everyone was cast really well.The veil between real and CGI world rarely feels so thin. The transition from CGI to real is smooth and helps immersion. The stunts and action sequences are really well done. All actors behave and look like a real tactical unit would outside movie set. The way they move, hold gun and interact with each another shows that training with live ammunition did pay off. The characters and world they are in are believable.

Maybe only thing I missed is a bit more plot or at least more action, but both lacked a bit as some parts the main characters where just moving from one place to other and not much happened."
