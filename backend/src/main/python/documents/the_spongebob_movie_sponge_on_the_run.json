Overall, very pleasing to watch, and quite enjoyable for the whole family. Very true to what Spongebob should be and always has been. Can't say much for the plot, but it definitely had me giggling and grinning the whole time."

      "text": "E-Value: 8Acting: 8Plot: 6Due to the COVID-19 pandemic which forced the theatres to close down until further notice, the third SpongeBob theatrical movie was released digitally on Netflix outside of the USA while Canada have a theatrical release three months ago.It is a fine and normal day in Bikini Bottom until Mr. Krabs\u2019 archnemesis and business rival, Plankton, tries to steal the Krabby Patty formula once again. However, his plan keep getting indirectly ruined by SpongeBob SquarePants (Kenny), who is totally unaware of what is going on. While trying to find a way to get rid of SpongeBob, Plankton come across a royal decree from King Poseidon (Berry).According to the decree, King Poseidon demand a snail for his own use. Taking advantage of this, Plankton abduct Gary and deliver him to the king knowing that SpongeBob would look for him. As expected, SpongeBob soon discovers Gary\u2019s disappearance and leaves Bikini Bottom without telling anyone.With the help from his best friend, Patrick Star, they go on an adventure to rescue Gary from King Poseidon, who resides in the Atlantic City. Along the way, they receive some guidance from Sage (played by Keanu Reeves) to help them in their journey.Some people say a third movie is always the worst chapter in a trilogy. In this case, The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run is not one of them.  This movie still retains the same charms from the first two movies and the TV series. The movie is filled with humours and heartwarming moments along with some character developments. Despite the movie transition from traditional 2D animation to CGI animation, it does not ruin the experience of watching this movie. That said, the animation is great and well done.As for the cast, everyone has done a great voice acting performance and it\u2019s really great to have everyone from the TV series to reprise their role for the movie unlike Scoob! which was released few months ago. It is also great to see some celebrities making humourous cameos in the movie. Keanu Reeves once again stole the show by proving to everyone that he can play a comedic role just like his voice role in 2019\u2019s Toy Story 4.Although this is the third movie, you don\u2019t actually need to watch the first two movies to understand this one. The plot is completely standalone and have nothing to do with previous two movies. However, the plot of this movie is not exactly new or original because this movie rehash a similar plot of the first movie. Two characters go on a journey to another city retrieve a McGuffin that triggers the event of the movie. Nevertheless, the movie is still fun to watch and I definitely recommend this movie especially if you are a fan of SpongeBob."

      "text": "Really fun. The plot is kinda generic, but the real draw is the 3D animation. It really brought depth and color (hard to imagine more color) to well-tread ground and I loved seeing all my favorite parts of BB and it's denizens. I generally don't care for this move (exceptions being this, Peanuts, and Lupin), but it was a homer here.Drawbacks were Camp Coral and the guest stars. Hard to believe they felt the need to nerf a kids show, but I did not like the idea of the kids portrayed as these nobler then though characters who, I guess, turn into the goofy doors we know and love. I know it's a plug for the new show, but the original appealed to all ages, CC is for 5 and under. The guest stars just impeded the plot more than helped it. It was a distraction and added nothing."

      "text": "Between inconsistencies, disrespect for the original work and a lot of scriptwriting facilities. The 2020 film struggles to find an identity, thus bathing in the fan service between Snoop Dogg or Keanu Reeves. On the other hand, one can almost blame a successful artistic side. Stepping out of his comfort zone, Spongebob tries the 3D, and, while keeping his bases, he succeeds in offering us a ameliorative spectacle for the eyes, despite the scenario that does not break three legs to a snail."

Sadly, this is nothing more than a television script plot (and one where the series told this same story in just 30 mins) being stretched out to fill the runtime. It's ultimately another pointless exercise in trying to justify the existence of \"Spongebob Squarepants\" in 2021."

I\u2019m not talking about the obvious first I want to start with the bad things first, the over use of celebs like Snoop Dogg is here for one scene, I like Danny Trejo but why is he here, Tiffany Haddish is in for like 6 seconds so then she\u2019s gone. The other thing is King Poseidon\u2019s voice, not to hate on Matt Berry but he was the voice of Bubbles in the last movie like kinda lazy. But the celeb cameo I love obviously Keanu Reeves I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s stupid or not I love it. Of course the cast comes back and do great no complaints. Now the animation IS GORGEOUS OH MY GOD GRAVEY. There is so much detail you can see each hair on Sandy even the scratches on her helmet, SpongeBob\u2019s chair you can see it\u2019s inflatable, then when they get to the Lost City of Atlantic City the animation goes to 50 it\u2019s so pretty. Oh and Spongebob says crap. Overall it\u2019s the best SpongeBob movie, beautiful animation and Keanu Reeves. Ranking Amazing."

And it's not like because of the movie as a whole is a drag, the entire issue specifically revolves around 2 scenes which could've easily been fixed. If you saw the movie, you know which ones I mean because holy **** they drag on forever. The first one should just be cut entirely, its **** pointless. And the second one should've been SIGNIFICANTLY reduced. The rest of the movie is ok. The story is very basic. I liked the songs and music, even the ones in the pointless senses, and the animation is easily the best part of the movie. Sad that this is the worst of the 3 movies."
