I regularly gripped my chair tightly, looked away from the screen, and wanted out. But that's kind of the point, isn't it? To sell exactly how insane this stunt really was. I'm not a huge Robert Zemickis fan, but I have to say, this was pretty convincing.\r Additionally, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is equally convincing as the man himself, selling a French accent and a distinctive attitude. You believe the guy would do what he's doing. His wire-walking, while obviously not as audacious as the original's since it's in a studio, is nonetheless a product of some real-life effort that is quite impressive.\r There are a few eye-rolling Hollywood moments, but on the whole, this is a rare film that holds great suspense even though you probably know what's going to happen.

The appearance of another studio film trying to capitalize on an incredible true story\u2013one that was already satisfyingly revealed, no less, in the awe-inspiring 2008 documentary: Man on Wire\u2014was certainly working against this production, only baiting the cynics in their preparation to deride the typical inaccuracies and manipulations.  Surprisingly though, The Walk is truly laudable due to its utter respect for this legendary wire-walker named Philippe Petit\u2014a man that gave us the show of a lifetime by daring to walk a tight wire from one of the twin towers to the other; actually, scratch that, maybe even two or three lifetimes.\r Joseph Gordon-Levitt inhabits this eccentric character with the utmost dedication and methodology, livening every element of the individual with a remarkable magnitude of authenticity whether it\u2019s the perfection of a thick French accent, or even his pronunciations  when he\u2019s actually speaking the language for extended periods of time.  He\u2019s clearly working with such a burden here, and at the same time, he\u2019s also infusing the maximum dose of charisma into this character.  Pleasantly observe the totally natural French-like mannerisms he subtly permeates into his confrontational arguments with those around him\u2013friends who\u2019re incessantly vexing him with their distrust in this insane stunt he\u2019s so eager to pull.  Thanks to the support of an exceptional cast\u2014including the lovable James Badge Dale; the great Ben Kingsley; an unfamiliar, refreshing actress in Charlotte Le Bon; as well as all the other cohorts and their comic relief next to them\u2014strengthens Levitt\u2019s energy on the screen that much strongly.\r It\u2019s a gripping portrait of artistic obsession\u2014that inability to admit defeat even in the face of impossible odds.  Perhaps, sometimes,the more incensed and impatient side of this otherwise  amiable guy might be exposed, but once he finally reaches the roof of the southern twin tower with mounds and mounds of imperative (daredevil) equipment, you want this for him almost as much as he does.   Thus, it becomes an undeniably fun caper with a mischievous score that recalls the audacity of Ocean\u2019s crew. Subsequently, a beautiful, soaring score greets us as the vastness of the city  and the romantic posture of the horizon comes into view on the roof; if Phillip falls, it would surely be a glorious death.  Inevitably but understandably, some doubt the necessity of a documentary remake.  In this case, what was frankly unclear throughout those interviews was lucidly visualized here.  Vague descriptions and mappings could only take your imagination so far, which is why veteran director Robert Zemeckis prioritizes absolute audience involvement by implementing suspenseful excitement into sequences that see this group break in past security, maintaining feverish pacing in the process.\r But, of course, what we\u2019re really here for is the sheer potential of incredible thrills from the famous wire-walking.  As I\u2019ve hinted at previously, this is an absolute must-see in IMAX 3D just like Avatar and Gravity were.  The beauty of Paris and New York City are greatly enhanced in all their lavish detail, and the depth in those daunting shots that look down from lofty heights makes the experience drastically more immersive.  As the camera glides from the top of a tower down to the very streets of New York, you could almost feel that rush.  The Walk finds every possible technical maneuver in amping up the audience\u2019s anxiety during these scenes\u2013close-ups of Phillip\u2019s sweat or carefully-placed feet balancing on a slightly vibrating rope, followed by the camera\u2019s panning and circling around Petit\u2019s various tricks on the wire which only increase in difficulty.\r Essentially, this film has achieved an astonishing feat in wholly justifying a cinematic retelling of the true story. With that being said, there are details that\u2019re over-dramatized as can be expected from a Hollywood production in order to build superficial tension, or even those that\u2019re fictionally inserted to give a scene the fullest dramatic effect.  Occasional moments remind us we\u2019re only watching a movie after all, whether it\u2019s some  inspirational dialogue or the predictable action beats like someone tipping over at the worst time.  Overall, its rare (live-action) PG rating allows the whole family to attend and enjoy the classic thrills, the frequent humor, and the ravishing vistas\u2014what a charming feast!"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This biographical drama about high-wire artist Philippe Petit is presented in a  surprising and classical narration from the beginning till the end which turns out very successful thanks to its well balanced visual effects and fact adaptations.

Main actor Joseph-Gordon Levitt's efforts in practicing high-wire experience and learning French are fruitful which his charming performance and immersion in portraying Philippe  manages to attract the audiences to fall in love and to follow the fierce determination to achieve a \"suicidal ambition\". Director Zemeckis' ingenious camera work, CGI, SFX as well as the beautiful scores have brought this chilling and insane lifetime experience to a feeling like walking on the wire in real life.

One of the things I liked was that the scenes in France are mostly in French with subtitles and when the characters do speak English, it's simply because they want to practise for when they go to America, instead of just randomly having them speak English like most film makers would.

Either way, you're getting to watch an excellent movie.\r Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives yet another phenomenal performance. Fully invested in his role, he's truly able to sell himself as Philippe Petit.

But it was still horrible and I will probably have trouble falling asleep for a few nights because of the visions of the Void the movie leaves behind. Perhaps it's therapy.\r And even if it isn't the movie is very well made, both as a period piece (Man I miss the 70s...) and as a visual representation of lunacy channeled into art. I could have done without the narration though. If there's one thing I hate it's fourth wall-violating narrations. It's so...Disney.

This monologue heavy delivery requires that caliber of performance from the lead, also reminds me of Ewan McGregor on Big Fish. It takes the audience on a bizarre yet fascinating adventure and makes us feel like a part of the character's larger-than-life endeavor.\r This is the story of Philippe Petit, a performer with the idea of wire-walking across the World Trade Center towers. While it may sound simple, the journey there is a captivating one. The presentation is almost magical with circus act and flamboyant atmosphere, although there are plenty of realistic details and intricate planning involved, at times it almost feels like a funny heist movie.\r Visual is breathtaking, the cinematography takes full advantages of the vistas, let it be small village or big city. The way the scenes are shot gives the movie a much more surreal ambiance. It's an enhanced realism, and although it's not as refined, there's a spirit of Hugo lingering here. It makes great use of 3D with timely panoramic shots and even stuff-thrown-at-your-face antic, but for this movie I wouldn't mind.\r The same goes with its jazz influenced soundtracks, occasional slow ballad or alternate take on popular songs. The production value just oozes gorgeousness. All the technical aspects aside, the best attraction is definitely Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He is utterly remarkable, youthful and charming. This is the kind of acting prowess that can captivate audience with sheer passion, it\u2019s a true homage to the real life counterpart.\r The Walk is nothing short of a breathtaking tale.

The film's strongest aspects were easily the daring visuals and cinematography, of course especially during the walk in the film's last half hour. All of this combined with Gordon-Levitt's tight-roping skills completely captivated me during that film's portion. As for the story and film itself, I really enjoyed watching this incredible true story come to life onscreen. Even though the titular walk of the film doesn't occur until approximately the last half hour, the rest of the film before it and the events that build up to it were interesting to watch and made it well worth it.

The Walk is based on the story of the real-life high wire artist Philippe Petit in 1974. Inspired by a circus he saw at a young age, Philippe begins planning an incredibly ambitious -- and highly illegal -- show in which he hangs a wire across the Twin Towers and walks across them. A majority of the story is dedicated to Petit gathering accomplices to help with the coup, practicing for the extreme conditions and planning how they will rig the wire. The clever writing allows you to connect with every character and understand why they're trying to attempt this impossible dream. The last 45 minutes or so is where \"the walk\" actually happens. The scenes of Petit and co rigging the wire are just as tense as the wire-walking scenes, which are accented by some of the best cinematography of the year. The cinematography is really the star of the movie here. The shots panning down towards the ground make the towers almost look endless, and it adds so much tension to the walking scenes.

The film uses a lot of visual effects, and most of them are nearly seamless. It's always great to see New York from far above, but this may be one time it's not as much fun.

It make's every scene in he's films look absolutely jaw dropping and visually stunning. That's why Robert Zeneckis always wanted to make this movie so badly, so he can take that stunning visual style that he has and put it to the big screen.

But I needed to see the film myself to judge and while knowing the film has positive reviews, I need to judge myself.\r After seeing \"The Walk\", I can safely say that Zemeckis nailed it once again as this movie was great.\r Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a solid job playing Philippe Petit. Gordon-Levitt really got into his character, because he actually learned wire walking and how to do it correctly by Philippe Petit himself. I know a lot of people have been talking about Joseph Gordon-Levitt french accent in the movie and how out of place it can be, and yes I do admit it did take me off guard a bit, but I got use to it after awhile. But here's the thing; Philippe Petit doesn't have an normal french accent and I think Gordon-Levitt did a great job emulating that. I think Joseph Gordon-Levitt did the best performance he could have done and I got to give him credit for that and I'm standing by that.\r Robert Zemeckis directed this movie and as I said before; Zemeckis knows how to push the boundaries of CGI technology with the movie he made such as: Back to the Future, Who framed Roger Rabbit and Forrest Gump. And Zemeckis once again did an excellent job telling an interesting story and the use of CGI bleeding in perfectly with the environment that the movie is set in. Robert Zemeckis is the man for the job when it comes to film making like this and he did such an amazing job directing this movie. Nicely done Zemeckis.\r The second act of the movie where he starts to walk across the wire between the twin towers was absolutely amazing and also terrifying, because I have this thing with heights and I can go vertigo easily. I sawed the movie in IMAX 3D and my god the 3D in this movie worked so incredibly well that I literally felt like I was up there with Gordon-Levitt. My hands were sweating, my heart was pumping and the sequence itself was truly spectacular.\r The visual effect's in this movie are so perfectly executed and so beautiful to look at. I would go this far and call it flawless CGI as it's truly stunning.\r Now for the problems: The first half of the movie felt a little underwhelming and a bit slow for me. It felt a bit dragged out with some of the scenes and it made the pasting seem a little slow.\r Overall The Walk may have a slow first half, but the second act of the film is so perfectly executed and it's absolutely worth seeing in IMAX. The acting is great, the directing is fantastic, the visual effect's are stunning and the 3D is worth the price of a ticket."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "The Walk is directed by Robert Zemeckis and stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the main role as Philippe Petit a wire man whose dream is to hang a wire in between the Two Towers in New York and walk on it.\rThis movie is based on a true story,which I knew nothing about and honestly that made the experience much better considering that I did not know how it played out.The acting is magnificent,Joseph Gordon-Levitt has proven over and over again that he is an amazing actor.His accent in the movie I thought it would bother me when I heard it in the trailer but it actually did not.I got used to it very soon and by the end I even forgot that he was doing an accent at all.\rThe movie does take its time to start though,as its very slow buildup in the beginning but the second half its astonishing and a wonderful achievement with stunning visual effects that make you feel as if you're actually there,and considering that I am afraid of heights it truly struck me and I loved it.It is also intense,interesting and above all inspiring.Seeing this guy do the impossible and make his dream come true that truly inspires me and everyone else who's seen it to go for our dream and try to do the impossible.\rI really enjoyed the movie,despite a very slow start and quiet honestly also a somewhat forced romance.Still this is a very well done movie with very good acting,great visuals and a very intense final act that will stay with you even after you see the movie."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "A really good, interesting movie based on real life events. At first I thought it might be boring for most part, but movie actually was really interesting from the start to the end, loved the performances and enjoyed the narrative style too. Plus the whole surroundings and everything felt so real and breathtaking - one of the best movies I have seen lately."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "The Walk has been a shocking and funny film , the fun part in some scenes, so shocking to walk on a rope from the extinct twin towers. Good plot , great acting of Joseph Gordon- Levitt, and good work of Robert Zemeckis , a unique and memorable experience in the heights ."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This movie will inspire you to do the impossible, shaking from being so nervous to see the end. The actors do a great job creating tension. You will feel emotional not just for the story but for the Towers themselves."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "The Twin Towers of the World Trade Centre have been brought back to life. Robert Zemeckis directs another gorgeous looking film with special effects that completely immerses the audience into a uniquely historic and meaningful event. Joseph Gordon-Levitt delivers an incredibly convincing performance along with the rest of the cast. However the film is quite slow at the beginning with unnecessary narration during the final walk that distracts the audience and makes the moment feel less real."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "The film is a miracle, Zemeckis has once again created an incredible adventure. I am delighted with this picture, I really liked it well despite the fact that at first I saw this movie in a theater with a recording of Ukrainians. It will be exciting. Well done."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Witness the epic story of Philippe Petit, the man who dared to walk across a wire suspended between the twin towers. The amazing event portrayed on the big screen, in 3D no less. Definitely worth a watch, the catch however, you'll have to sit through at least an hour of pure fluff, Philippe's early life in Paris as told through one of the most cringe inducing narrations in film history, made all the worse by Joseph Gordon-Levitt's attempt at a French accent. Points for effort as the rest of his performance redeems itself. Honestly there's only one scene in this film that makes it worth the time, everything else is just padding, and there is absolutely no excuse for CGI juggling, none.\rRecommended yet the documentary that stars the real life Philippe Petit is a much better watch."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I vaguely remember this happening and seeing it on the nightly news back when I was in college.  Had no idea of the rigging involved, the challenge or \"artistry\" as Phillipe called it, or how much planning went into sneaking all of the equipment up there.  To see Phillipe's background and training with Papa Rudy was a nice touch.  But best of all was to see the Twin Towers again.  I remember looking down from the observation deck window and YIKES! it was scary even though I was inside the glass."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "The Walk excites us and gets us dizzy with its deep-impressing story and the lovable reminder of the two World Trade Centers captured us just right there and here."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Joseph Gordon-Levitt is at his best here in a film that for the last 20 minutes will either have you or on the edge of your seat, or if you are like me, a little nauseous. Levitt narrates the tale in a jovial and at times, quite amusing way that makes it very easy to watch and gets you rooting for Philippe very quickly. It quickly becomes apparent that the walk is becoming an obsession for him and you end up just wanting for him to do it to keep himself sane and his relationship with his girlfriend Annie. The actual walk is brilliantly shot and acted and leaves you with a sense of relief and happiness at the end. Being the twin towers it's also a rather poignant story. They were considered ugly concrete blocks, but the daring and inspiration of Philippe's walk gave them a soul and helped New Yorkers fall in love with them. A thoroughly excellent film and you'll finish it feeling a mixture of emotions, but for me it was quite euphoric."}], "recommendations": ["you_were_never_really_here", "the_rover", "hugo", "127_hours", "nocturnal_animals", "the_master", "in_the_heart_of_the_sea", "youth", "first_man", "the_place_beyond_the_pines", "magnolia", "the_great_gatsby", "last_night_in_soho", "the_perfect_storm", "the_assassination_of_jesse_james_by_the_coward_robert_ford", "everest", "21_grams", "ex_machina", "bringing_out_the_dead", "roma", "the_finest_hours", "good_time", "unbreakable", "inception", "black_swan"]}
