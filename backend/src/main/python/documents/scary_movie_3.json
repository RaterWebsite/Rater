      "text": "With the third film in the Scary Movie franchise, David Zucker adds a certain level of competence to proceedings, the addition of Leslie Nielsen is always a positive, and Charlie Sheen playing Mel Gibson's character from Signs is a stroke of comedy genius. The film just about hits the good joke quota, and Anna Farris is still mildly amusing and gets the job done reprising her ditsy lead role. The best film parody is 8 Mile (which incorporates a certain egotistical British talent judge playing himself) which is a bit odd considering the film is a \"Scary Movie\". All the film spoofs are pretty well executed, probably slicker than they ever have been in this series, and in much of Zucker's own career, though it's a bit odd that so few of the parodies relate directly to the horror genre. The whole film still never quite comes together - some of the gags fall flat, and some of it is just plain embarrassing, and not in an intentionally hilarious way. While the vast majority of the jokes and parodies will at least raise a smile, Scary Movie 3's main achievement is unfortunately reminding you how good David Zucker used to be, but no longer is. His current work can still loosely be classed as comedy, so at least he's doing a bit better than his early writing partners, brother Jerry and Jim Abrahams, but David must still be pining for the good old days of Airplane!, Naked Gun and even BASEketball."

Both Cindy & Brenda are back but this time joined by a new crop of actors, most of which are very funny and perfect for the series. The writers cleverly merge together the likes of Signs, The Ring and even movies that aren't Horror but in a way that still really works. There are also some hilarious LOL moments that weren't as evident in the others. Overall funny stuff and good for a laugh!"

I knew number 1 was an all time favourite but I little worried when I wanted to watch number 3 as I heard people where giving it some pretty mediocre reviews. So a couple easters ago I decided to watch it with my friend. Needless to say....we liked the film a bunch! I loved the comedy and how everything was just so random in the film. I love when people can make horror funny, it turns a frown upside down. The choice of actors was ok, the only person I really recognised was Charlie Sheen. I don't like how people criticise this film for having a childish plot. It's a spoof movie!!! It's not supposed to be serious!!! Go watch batman or inception or something if you wanna look for drama. So, I enjoyed watching scary movie and I had myself a good laugh too!"

      "text": "Scary Movie 3 is a 2003 American science fiction horror comedy parody film, which parodies the horror, sci-fi, and mystery genres, directed by David Zucker. It is the third film of the Scary Movie franchise, as well as the first to have no involvement from the Wayans family. The film's plot significantly parodies the films The Ring, Signs, The Matrix, The Matrix Reloaded and 8 Mile."

Disjointed from beginning to end and possibly the worst movie ever made. Now that is scary. Sucked big time. But if you don't believe me and still want to see, make sure you wear a paper bag over your head because the management at your local theater will be laughing at you coming out of the show? You want to die from embarrassment when you walk out. You have been warned."

Scary Movie 3 may not be the most intellectual comedy ever but it is enjoyable overall."

      "text": "While the Scary Movie film series got worse in general this movie has redeeming qualities. I made the statement that each movie was worse than the previous. After rewatching I will admit that this one is better than Scary Movie 2. It is mainly a spoof movie / parody of The Ring, Signs and 8 Mile with side-blows to Sixth Sense, Matrix, American Idol, Mars Attacks and others. There is also an awkward appearance by Michael Jackson.  Most of the jokes work well with some great and a bit more failing ones. The actors do their best what they can do with the script. I think that the actors were hold back by the writing or script and would do better otherwise. I will praise them for what they have done and not blame them. Anna Faris is really talented and maybe the Scary Movie series hold her career slightly back. She delivers her role and is a plus. Her filmography and acting career is noteworthy. Also there are some cameos by several rappers. But this is a plus for music preferences only. If you like it it is good and if you don't have interests in Rap music you wouldn't even recognize them. My main complaint is that the movie feels really constructed. Many parts that shouldn't belong together were merged and the edges are still visible. Maybe a parody for one movie would be better then 3 in 1. I will even made the statement that with slimming the content, more polish and better writing this could become a general appreciated movie in the 7-9/10 range. Also Leslie Nielsen is not good in this movie. Overall an improvement over the prequel but it was just a last stand against the decline of the movie series. Bonus knowledge: Did you know that Leslie Nielsen was used only for serious or dramatic no nonsense characters for most of his career? Only relatively late he was typecast for spoof movies / parodies. It is even named \u201cThe Leslie Nielsen Syndrome\u201d."

      "text": "Tolerable.This is the third film in the \"Scary Movie\" franchise ... and this time, Cindy will be the protagonist of satirical situations and parodies of notable mild horror films like \"War of the Worlds\", \"The Happening\", \"Signs\" or \" The Ring \u201d. That is, this film repeats exactly the same formula that we already know, changing only the films that are the target of satire. It does not present anything new or that has not been rehearsed in the previous two films, and the jokes are much weaker and loaded with sexual allusions, appealing to easy laughter. The dialogues are uninteresting.The film again brings some of the actors that we already know, in the characters that we are used to. I refer specifically to Anna Faris and Regina Hal who, with their characters, are the protagonists of the film. They do a reasonable job, but not brilliant. I also liked Leslie Nielsen's effort, despite the fact that he is much more subdued and serious than usual. The film features several cameos and names known as Queen Latifah, Denise Richards, Pamela Andersen and Jenny McCarthy, but without any brightness or remarkable merit. Overall, the cast does a poor job.Technically, it is a film that invested heavily in visual and special effects, and that was an interesting and successful maneuver on the part of the production. The effects are good and have quality. It's a relatively short film, it doesn't tire the audience, and even those who didn't like it very much see the film without problems. The sets and costumes do their job, as does the soundtrack. The biggest problem with this film is, in fact, the rather poor interpretation of the cast."
