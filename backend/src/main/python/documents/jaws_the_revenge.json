      "text": "The original Jaws is still (quite rightly) regarded as a cinematic classic and, as is so often the case, executives were determined to rinse every last penny they could from the franchise. This is the result.....You wouldn't even think the pitch for this movie, one in which a shark is apparently out to get revenge on the Brody family for killing the great white in the original (no this isn't a comedy), would get past an initial meeting but it somehow actually made it all the way to being filmed. Every element of this movie, from the script to the direction to the acting, is downright awful and even at a running time of less than an hour and a half it felt like it dragged on forever."

      "text": "An awful movie when compared to the original or even Jaws 2. Jaws: The Revenge does everything right when you want to do everything you can to kill a franchise. If you watch the respectable Jaws 2, you hear a line uttered that goes as followed, \"Sharks don't take things personally, Brody.\" Apparently noone told the studio that during the pitch meeting for this complete **** of a film, its a garbage film with none of the tension or taste you get when you watch Jaws. Its a disappointing end to a once-proud series"

It also has some of the most silliest most laughable writing I have ever seen in a film. I don\u2019t recommend this movie at all! I would avoid it at all costs!"

      "text": "Quite possibly the dumbest and most insulting movie Universal Studios has ever given us. I have respect for Lorraine Gary for reprising her role in this movie, but everything wrong with this film can be found from start to finish.This movie sacrifices what could have been satisfying character arcs for the pointless and weak storyline this movie actually has to offer. At no point does Jaws: The Revenge actually manage to take itself seriously. We\u2019re led to believe that Roy Scheider\u2019s character from the first movie was supposedly \u201ckilled from the fear\u201d of the sharks, despite having killed two sharks already. Another flaw is that the kills are literally impossible to take seriously. (Especially that kill on the banana boat, lmao.) Just stick to watching Jaws and Jaws 2. Those are the only good movies in the entire franchise. How? they are good because the studio actually put effort into them."

      "text": "Wow. This is the second time the Jaws franchise has a bad sequel! It is so horrible, it is one of the worst films of all time! I hate it so much because this is the equivalent of a broken toilet cleaner.Jaws 4: The Revenge is about another shark, named Vengeance, appears and kills Sean Brody. Ellen Brody is very upset and moves to the Bahamas to visit her other son, Mike and his family. However, guess who else arrived in the Bahamas? Vengeance, the stupid and fake shark is back! Only 2 shark kills in the entire film(3 in theaters) and the way the shark is killed, except on TV, is dumb and ridiculous. Vengeance was not as bad as Brucetta(shark in Jaws 3-D), but the whole movie is worse than Jaws 3-D. Jaws 4: The Revenge has the same plot as the other 3 films and it's not scary, bad characters, bad development, and bad shark. So, don't watch this disappointment. It was pathetic and very unnecessary."

      "text": "Jaws: The Revenge was indeed the final chapter in the Jaws movies and the last sequel starring Lorraine Gary from Jaws and Jaws 2 and Michael Caine. Made in 1987, Jaws: The Revenge has some good moments like the guy who goes out at night on his boat and gets ripped apart and killed by the shark. This movie is certainly better than Jaws 2 I don't care who disagrees because it's fact!!! So in this case I give Jaws: The Revenge a 8 rating."

      "text": "Man, people really hate these last two sequels, eh?I don't even think 'Jaws 3-D' is as awful as most fellow reviewers think and that's the case again with 'Jaws: The Revenge'. It's bad, but it's not *that* bad. It makes little sense, though to be fair it is from a franchise that is all about a huge human-killing shark; despite sharks, in fact, not actually being all that keen on our rotten flesh.Michael Caine is somehow in this. Well, I say somehow... a trip to the Bahamas and a nice paycheck likely made it entirely logical from his view; as he reportedly stated himself. Lorraine Gary, meanwhile, spearheads an average support cast. Speaking of whom, I did find their dialogue and interactions to be very unnatural and forced.5/10. There are many, many worse films out there though."

      "text": "Wow.  Wow! This movie is so horrible I am laughing in the stands watching the cut-rate action scenes, my God! The shark roars like a lion, somehow has a psychic relationship with the Brodys, survives out of water, and explodes like a balloon when poked with a mast! My God, they could not even use original footage! Razzie well-earned, my friend.  The acting was also quite horrible too.  Lorraine Gary had probably one of her worst, most annoying performance ever.  It\u2019s not her fault, though.  It was Joseph Sargent\u2019s.  This is why everyone acted so horribly in this rubbish movie, maybe except for Michael Caine.  However, this movie, in some respects, was better than Jaws 3-D, with some continuity picking up, with Lee Fierro coming back to reprise her role as Mrs. Kintner, the mother of Alex Kintner, who fell victim to a shark attack in the good \u201cJaws.\u201d  Oh, how far we have fallen from there."
