Remy is a great protagonist, the kitchen staff is fun, and the critic has the single best monologue of any character in any Pixar film. The movie isn't perfect, but it is definitely good enough to earn a 10/10; the slower moments are made up for by the quality of the rest of the film."

      "text": "Out of all 12 Pixar films, Ratatouille has to be the finest if only because it is one of the most visually stunning movies ever made. While other films try to show off the majestic look of Paris (Midnight in Paris, Taken and Monte Carlo) they never really succeed and its odd that the film that finally pulls it off isn't even live action. If anything Ratatouille is the most grown up of the Pixar fold (even Up) with the story being remarkably layered and engrossing. Sure the beginning is a bit slow but the slow build works because when Remy finally crawls out upon the magnificent vista that is Paris the film takes flight. It is a fast paced story of a rat named Remy (Voiced by Patton Oswald) who has always wanted to be a chef despite his obvious limitations He finally gets that chance thanks to an inept yet lovable human named Linguini (Lou Romano). There are some truly stunning parts of Ratatouille but you I won't ruin them because they really are fantastic. Of course it is a film for both child and adult as every other Pixar film but the thing that holds it up above all the others is the fact that the film builds as it goes. Unlike Up which has a brilliant opening sequence but doesn't live up to it, Ratatouille gets better as it goes with one moment near the end with Peter O'Toole's Ego being a brilliant piece of film despite the fact there are absolutely no words spoken. It is a classic film that gave me lots to think about after I watched it and even more after I watched it again. A real masterpiece."

This one is the best. Nothing was trite, nothing was too hip to keep it from being timeless, and nothing was formulaic other than the mild relationship to \"Ben and Me\". Just when you thought it was over, you say, \"Wait; what about Ego the food critique?\". And so it goes. Animation was magical and spectacular, and the character development was first-rate. I have already reserved a copy for me and for my grandkids from Amazon when its out for distribution."

Unlike most \"children's\" movies, there was no annoying sidekick character playing the buffoon; the humor was wonderful--both kids and adults were hooting all around me; and the art of it was unbelievable--scratches on the copper pots, bubbles in the soup, realistic details everywhere. And in Paris, I enjoyed the \"special\" details cleverly tucked into the background--the \"no smoking\" poster in French, the traffic, the Bateaux Mouches, the Notre Dame rose window. I have loved movies my entire life, and this one is clearly in My Favorite Top 10!"

It's about following dreams, heeding the heart, and how perseverance can lead to triumph. Told and presented in a flawless technical skill, through characters and situations only PIXAR could deliver. This is a form of perfection, and do not deny yourself the experience."

      "text": "Does anyone really want to see a film about a rat \u2013 you know, one of those promiscuous, verminous beasts who haunt sewers and spread deadly disease \u2013 working in a restaurant? On paper, hell no. From Pixar, yes with (dinner) bells on. Ratatouille overcomes any intrinsic ick-factor thanks to the bottomless charm of its teeny rodent hero, Remy (voiced by US comic Patton Oswalt). With its plate-wide eyes, pencil-eraser nose and ability to make the omelette of your dreams, this mini master chef couldn\u2019t be cuter if its name was Nigella. Witness the turning-point scene where hapless gourmet-diner garbage boy Linguini (Lou Romano) quizzes the far-from-home critter (who understands English, but only speaks it with his own species) on his culinary talents: Remy\u2019s adorably coy nods and self-deprecating shrugs prove yet again that Pixar has no peer when it comes to nailing the nuances of expression.\r Yes, Ratatouille thinks small, but with big results. Scripter/director Brad Bird rolls back the sweep of The Incredibles and doesn\u2019t shoot for The Iron Giant\u2019s emotional swell. Instead, he whips up a deceptively frothy souffl\u00e9. And, like any great cook, he knows that the trick lies in keeping all the ingredients in delicate balance. So there\u2019s the sweet but not too sickly buddy-buddy relationship (a Pixar staple) between Linguini and Remy, the former becoming the toast of the town as he covertly channels the latter\u2019s flair for French cuisine (via some deft hair-pulling puppetry) into new, delicious dishes. There\u2019s also the obligatory moral (\u201cAnyone can cook\u201d), gently stirred in rather than shoved down the throat. And then we have the meaty chunks of chase action, Remy scampering through the niftily choreographed chaos like a four-pawed Buster Keaton (usually in flight from his Napoleonic nemesis, Ian Holm\u2019s head chef Skinner).\r The pace never gets as overheated as the similarly ratty Flushed Away, though; after all, we are in dreamy Paris, a place-setting Bird lushly romanticises (dewy by day, coruscating by night) without going in-Seine. In fact, he\u2019s not above a sly pop at the locals: \u201cWe hate to be rude... but we\u2019re French,\u201d quips Linguini\u2019s tough-cookie love interest Collette (Janeane Garofalo). Ratatouille\u2019s biggest beef, however, is with pernickety hacks, embodied here by poisonous, cadaverous restaurant reviewer Anton Ego (a super-snooty Peter O\u2019Toole). As the film winds down, it fires up a from-the-heart polemic against professional critics. A pre-emptive attack, perhaps, after the mixed notices for last year\u2019s Cars? Retaliation seems unlikely, though; while few will grade this among Pixar\u2019s best (over-generous running time; solid but \u2013 O\u2019Toole aside \u2013 unexceptional lung-work; one or two belly-laughs short), it\u2019s too sophisticated, zesty and nourishing to be dismissed as fast-food entertainment. Anyone can cook? Not like this.\r Novel in concept, exquisite in execution, another family feast from Pixar suitable for all palates. Not a studio chef d'oeuvre, perhaps, but still the richest of this year's animations. Don't miss the starter course, hilarious space short Lifted."

(How did he stumble upon a rat in the first place?) Remy learns a lot from the chef's recipes, and shares his immense knowledge with a nerd with no talent whatsoever, using him as a puppet, and this bizarre double act self-evidently outdo any well trained cook in Paris.  Moreover, the food critic whose devastating review made the former chef of the restaurant (our strange ghost) commit suicide, is enchanted with the dish based on the recipe of aforementioned chef, but prepared by our nerd who is guided bye the highly literate rat.

The pompous critic remembers why he loves food, as this dazzling comedy(you forget you're watching an animated picture) reminds us why we love the movies. \"Ratatouille\" is so sophisticated, there's an extra tier of sophistication that will fly under the radar of most moviegoers. \"Ratatouille\", to my utter disbelief, has references to the Canadian filmmaker Atom Egoyan and his film \"Felicia's Journey\". Ian Holm, who voices the role of Skinner, the chef in exile, was in Egoyan's \"The Sweet Hereafter\". This is such tremendous fun for cineastes because we can't understand why it's there in the first place. This piece of trivia is irrelevant to enjoying \"Ratatouille\", but the references are there, nevertheless. In an ordinary film, it's Linguini(voiced by Lou Romano) who'd be delusional(that a rat is actually doing the cooking), but in \"Ratatouille\", it's the delusion(from Skinner's point-of-view(he's the first person to see the rat); Skinner, who reminds me of that single person who sees the duck in those Aflac commercials) who has delusions(Chef Gusteau is Remy's muse). \"Ratatouille\" also has references to Carol Emschwiller's novel \"The Mount\" and Gary Larson's \"The Far Side\". And if you remember Ralph Fiennes' wine cellar speech to Embeth Davidtz in \"Schindler's List\", \"Ratatouille\" can be interpreted as a fantastical parable that sutures the rift between Jews and Germans. \"Ratatouille\" is a truly extraordinary movie that makes you laugh, cry, and most importantly, think. This is Pixar's high-water mark, and that's really saying something."
