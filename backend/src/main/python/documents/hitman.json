Firstly it is nothing like the video games (well I had to mention this, because after all it is supposed to be a Hitman movie), it just using the name to generate more sales. Secondly this film is just a generic action movie, with no character depth or development. After the first 20 minutes you have seen it all, the director will just repeat the same things until the last frames. Not even the action scenes are anything good. Mr. Timothy Olyphant is not a bad actor, but this role did not really suit him. Not recommended."

Performances were poor to average and the bad script and dialogues made this movie based on video game(never heard about it until I saw the movie) even worse. The story of a assassin who looked like computer programmed robot(that\u2019s how he was supposed to be though..ugh) drawn into political conspiracy did not generate much interest either. Overall Hitman may please a few people who like such game-based action flicks but in general it\u2019s unlikely this movie will impress someone at random with high chances it may frustrate more often.\rPersonally I hated this movie badly but I won\u2019t say everyone will hate this.\rHitman was a flop for me."

The problem is, that it doesn't vaguely capture the spirit, or the core, of the Hitman games. What seems the most misplaced is the pseudo-romantic little-boyish interaction between 47 and the Russian girl. In some ways the movie could have been rated as a passable action movie, but truth be told, IO-Interactive's directors and designers did a far better job on the story-telling and entertainment value. This is not good when comparing a movie to a game. So, basically the movie is an empty shell, which in no way has earned its title."

That particular fight was a re-shoot, too - the director originally had something else planned for that scene, but somebody felt an additional action sequence was needed, so - dumb fight. For the rest, it's a fast-moving film with some smash-mouth action. And the final denouement demonstrates Agent 47's cleverness at avoiding a trap (or setting one? you'll have to find out). Olyphant and Kurylenko are an interesting pair when they're given dialogue together (not as often as it could have been). Robert Knepper is great as always. While the soundtrack is loud, Zanelli put together a good one.\r A fun action movie, and a strong 6 out of 10."

I started to agree in a way, but the story was good, action was good, but I think the main critical saying is that the acting sucked. Like you have to agree, they write a good script, direct it on stage, film it with a camera and get it over with. But the acting truly sucked, the genre was good, but this movie is a letdown, the acting affected the power of the script and direction, the good screenplay is wasted. Overall a low budget crap show."

The action is mildly entertaining, but the gore is to fake to be believable and just seems to be in it for the sake of having it. The script is a series of predictable moments that you've seen happen a million times in other movies. The acting and characters are awful, and timothy olyphant makes for one of the worst main characters of all time, but that may just be do to the writing, he has no personality and constantly has the stupidest look on his face at all times. This movie sucks, it's almost bad as the Uwe Boll video game movies. Don't watch this crappy movie."

Anyway, if you haven't seen it and your a Hitman fan definitely check this out. I would put this up near the Bond films as my favorite \"spy\" films. When I picked this up from my local FYE I thought it was gonna be a bad movie where Hollywood would make a quick buck. It actually stayed close to it's game based roots as far as gadgets and stealth tactics go. Although it was a little weird seeing 47 \"fall in love\", the movie still was able to portray him as a cold blooded killer. It was interesting that Hitman: Absolution showed 47 had a softer side in the game. I wished they had released the game first, if that happened then the movie would make sense. Seeing that Agent 47 isn't just a \"Robotic Killer\" as seen in the older games. Don't let the negativity fool you into missing out on this movie. If you collect game items or game related items, or just a Hitman fan, buy this from your local FYE. It's not as bad as people say."

The two sides of his character were wonderfully played. It gives a glimpse into the life of 47... \"How does a good man decide when to kill?\" I've played all the games but I prefer the movie depiction of 47. The story could use some work, but it didn't ruin the movie for me. I'm buying the DVD!"

He buys a magazine for the luggage advertisements. \"Hitman\" satiates a hunger that cinephiles didn't know they possessed; a clamoring to see Sinead O'Connor mow down Russians in exotic locales like a post-cancer Jennifer Garner after radiation treatment. Timothy Olyphant is not your obvious choice to helm a shoot-em-up actioneer, but that's what they said about Bruce Willis when \"Die Hard\" came a callin'. Agent 47 is such a serene killer, you suspect that he's a closeted Buddhist who makes covert pilgrimages to the Bodhi tree in India for spiritual enlightenment and guidance(the Buddha instructed him to always keep two guns handy in any hotel ice machine). He's confident. That's for sure. He levels the playing field by mostly foregoing the utilization of any headwear; his shiny scalp making it easier for his enemies to pick him out in a crowded area. But \"Hitman is not a miss, man; it's less ridiculous than most action films adapted from video games. Agent 47's relationship with Nika(Olga Kurylenko) provides \"Hitman\" with that crucial element which often goes missing in most action films; a palpable chemistry, or in this case, sexual tension, between its primary male and female star. Bullets fly, yes, but sparks fly, too."

In the game you also travel around and explore beautiful environments which you see none of in the film. While I enjoyed Timothy Olyphants performance as Agent 47 I didn't feel he accurately portrayed the usually emotionless and completely ruthless assassin in the award winning game. As a fan of the game I was a little disappointed, but as a film I thought the story was intense and had a few good twists and turns, at times the acting and diolauge was a little cheezy some good shooting scenes but nothing we haven't seen before. Simply, Hitman was good but nothing special."

As far as just a movie goes, I found it to have a good story line, nicely played out action scenes, and characters that acted how they would in a game. I have played Hitman: Blood Money, and the awesomeness was what made me want to see the movie. I really think it takes a beyond spectacular movie to deserve a \"10\", so Hitman did admirably considering the limited scope of the games' worlds. I found some reviews to be harsh solely because the author disliked that it was based on a game, and one review I read in a newspaper completely misunderstood the plot. I feel some reviewers don't fully understand the kind of world 47 operates in as an assassin, and that lack of comprehension was because they hadn't played any of the games."

Olyphant is miscast as the famed Agent 47, and he doesn't really add much to the ridiculously overused role. I mean, I can actually give a shit if John McClaine gets killed, but I'd just give a shrug if it happened to Agent 47. If anything, I'd be surprised, because he doesn't seem to get injured whatsoever. If Hitman's worth anything more than a few fun action scenes, some gore, unintentional laughs, and staring at attractive, nude women, then it's a good, nostalgic present for you Dad if he grew up on ridiculous action movies."

Whilst the Bourne Ultimatum may be a more well crafted film, I find that movies of its type are all too ubiquitous and run-of-the-mill these days. It was very refreshing to see a film who's main protagonist was a cold, calculating killing machine. I honestly think it played out truthfully, and the reactions to his persona were believable and fascinating. I think I will remember this movie for a long time, not because it more well crafted than other movies in its genre or anything like that, but because it tells the story of a different and more refreshing character than the usual old Bourne / Bond / Die Hard / etc... types who are all identical in every way.
