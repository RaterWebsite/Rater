Though it will surely bore those who also hated The Babadook and It Follows, The Witch is another example of what horror is capable of -- truly great, atmospheric filmmaking.What The Witch has that the other recent great horror flicks of recent years doesn't though is a completely satisfying, unambiguous conclusion that will be welcomed by viewers who aren't a fan of \"artsy\" horror. It's a gorgeous, masterfully edited and scored, shocking 90 minutes."

The old time dialogue only brings out the confusion this movie brings to the table, and between that and the nearly pitch black scenes, many parts of this movie will leave you flat out boggled. Some good cinematography, acting, and surprising moments save this movie from being bad, but ultimately this one is a bore."

The movie wastes plenty of time giving you details about the family rather than trying to scare you, although none of it feels like it was worth taking up 75% PERCENT of the movie's runtime. At best you could watch this movie as a mystery/drama. The fact that this movie is at all classified as horror is just asking for people to be disappointed."

There are some beautiful scenes and some creepy images, but that seems to be all there is.  The characters in the movie don't react to anything, you never get the sense that the father is someone who would have been banished from a New England colony and they never go into why they are out there.  The main characters are all well-acted, but since none of them have an arch, it doesn't matter.  There's no story being driven forward by the characters, it's just things happening and aren't they scary?  No.  Not really.  Even the one feeble jump scare that seemed to get everyone in the theater was ultimately made pointless by the reveal at the end.  I was trying to think of why it was just not very satisfying and maybe I wasn't getting it (I'm sure \"real\" critics would argue that very idea), but after we left the theater, a girl walking nearby who had just seen it just said \"that was the worst movie I've ever seen\", and I started laughing because, yeah, I wanted to like it like the professional critics seem to, but I don't.  It's not entertaining, it's not interesting, it's well-made like a stock photo is well-made.  Parts seem to point to a whole, but there's no more to be had."

What comes through more strongly, however, is the enormity of the untamed wilderness around them, the absurdity of malnourished subsistence farmers living alone in the New World. The threat of witchcraft hanging over them can barely rival that.\r The movie brings different colors to the table. Dread is intermingled with humor, often through some oddly well-cast goats. The performances and dialogue are credible. The movie has a real ending, but questions are nonetheless left unanswered, even from the opening scene. The score is creepy, the direction taut, and I would want to see more from this creative team."

Based on reading this, it is unlikely you will have a desire to see this movie, so stop here if you so wish, or just take my word for it that this movie is definitely worth a watch. Okay, here is The Witch at face value. The movie starts with a family of 7 being kicked out of a puritan community because...well I have no idea why they were kicked out, they speak in this crazy language that sounds like drunk Shakespeare. Dost thou barter a pic sixpense for me ninny? Is something that was said during this movie. So the family drives this wagon (that totally looks like it's going to fall over) out of Jamestown or Boston or some s*** and drive it to a field where they're gonna start new lives. The father builds a house and other manly s*** while the daughter plays peekaboo with the family baby. She closes her eye for like 4 seconds and loses the baby. Horrible babysitter. The family moves on, because you know, back in those days like 80% of babies died. Anyway, The father and eldest son go hunting and try to shoot a rabbit, but the rabbit looks at them menacingly and his gun jams and something flies in his eyes, which are unaffected for the rest of the film. Then the boy and father get home and the two youngest children are playing with the family goat. The next morning the boy wants to go hunting but his older sister won't let him go alone and so she goes with him. After like a mile the girl falls off of the family horse and the boy goes on without her and makes out with this hot but clearly evil woman who came out of a tree. The girl wakes up and runs home to tell the family, later that night the boy teleports back to the home completely naked. The eldest daughter is accused of being a witch because the naked boy who was left out in the rain won't wake up. Then he wakes up and it turns out he was just choking on a gross apple. Then he re enacts what would appear to be an entire performance of Macbeth before dying. The Father thinks a witch killed his son and does what every rational parent would do, and locks every one of his 3 remaining children in sheds outside. He then stays outside and prays while eating dirt. Meanwhile, a crow goes in to motor boat the mother. Morning comes, the family goat kills the father, the two youngest children vanish and the mother tries to kill her only remaining child. The eldest daughter stabs the mother, goes to nap in a shed, wakes up to talk to the devil, then goes into the woods where tons of tastefully nude women are dancing and flying. The end. That's the movie, but you have to believe me...it's worth a watch."

      "text": "The Witch didn't exactly terrify me, but that's okay because I don't think that was the point. The film is marketed as an incredibly disturbing horror film set in the 1600s, which kind of misrepresents it to some degree. If you go into this film expecting the next Exorcist, you will be truly disappointed because it's not exactly like. The Witch feels more like a period piece that's a historical commentary on religious hysteria and the dark side of witchcraft.\r In The Witch, a Puritan family is banished to the edge of a large forest which happens to be home to a repulsive witch (my apologies to the actress playing her) and supernatural things begin to happen which tear the family apart. Eventually, everyone bar the main character Thomasin dies and then Thomasin makes a pact with Satan and joins the witches. An ending which has mystified and, strangely, angered many movie-goers. The ending is representative of Thomasin's desperation. If she didn't make the pact, her options were to risk going back to the plantation on foot, a journey that would take her several days on foot in addition to her possibly being tried as a witch if she was to explain the events that transpired on the farm. Or she could stay on the farm and starve to death. If I was in her shoes, I'd do the same thing.\r The film, however, does have it's roots firmly planted in the horror genre despite this fact through its usage of truly disturbing imagery. Samuel being turned into \"flying ointment\" at the very beginning sets the bleak tone of film incredibly. The family gradually tearing itself apart is a consistent theme that is executed excellently during the films tight one hour and thirty minute run-time. Other events such as Caleb's seduction and subsequent possession in addition to the creepy twins being, well, creepy twins helps the film fulfill it's promises of being a horror movie.  The use of lighting to conceal the witch is a brilliant touch, we never see her face in broad daylight except for one scene where she assumes a younger (and FAR better looking form) simply to seduce Caleb. In a scene where the witch appears at nighttime in the stables to startle the twins and Thomasin, her face is concealed by the shadows of night. This shot preys on our fear of the unknown and elevates the film into its status of critically acclaimed.\r I feel like The Witch's biggest flaw is just how radical it is. This is definitely a film that the common moviegoer will not understand, hence why many reviewers have given it a low score. In addition to this, the marketing portrays the film as more grandiose than it is, confusing any audience members (like me) who followed the marketing. Overall, the film is great for what it is, but as stated before, don't raise the bar too high."

The cinematography offers the viewer a bleak and rather desolate glimpse into isolated frontier life, albeit from an earlier time period.  The acting is pretty strong.  The complications and tragedy which befall the purposefully isolated family ranges from uncomfortable to disturbing to rather silly and overwrought.  Still, it is not the typical film of this genre and there was a strong attempt to do something different.  I was really on the fence about rating this.  I suspect that very religious people will be offended and horror movie buffs will be greatly disappointed.  It is thoughtful and accepting of the supernatural being real, which will surely disturb and anger some.  There is not a tremendous amount of character development, just bad and unfair things happening to people.  This will not be everyone's cup of tea,"

      "text": "Ever since seeing the trailer a few months ago, I've been dying to see The Witch. It calls to mind recent arthouse horror movies like The Babadook and Goodnight Mommy, but The Witch is far scarier than those movies. It's a grim, perverse, and disturbing tale of religious paranoia among a crumbling family that will surely be remembered alongside the likes of Rosemary's Baby and The Omen. The Witch takes place in 17th century in Puritan-era New England. A family is excommunicated from their village and settles on the edge of a vast forest. Soon thereafter, their baby goes missing into the woods, and the family is torn apart by accusations of witchcraft, black magic and possession. From the first ten minutes, The Witch has a morose atmosphere and starts out with an incredibly disturbing scene. The initial shock is carried through the next few scenes which are dialog-heavy and slower, causing the dread to continue to the next horror. The terror never lets up and only amplifies as the plot progresses until the final 20 minutes are agonizing to watch. I could only vaguely tell you how the movie ended because I was watching through my fingers. It's perversely scary. The acting is fantastic from the entire cast, especially from the child actors. They're given heavy stuff to work with and pull it off with unsettling results. Along with amazing cinematography and an ominous score, it'll be difficult to find a better horror movie than The Witch this year. It'll leave you shaking."

This dark film is both gripping and devastating because you know what is going to happen and can see no way out of its inevitable outcome. You hope for a savior and yet you also know that none is coming. Is it a horror film? Definitely and perhaps more devastating than most because Robert Eggers, the writer and director, takes the type of story we have read and seen many times before and makes it utterly real. It is also an indictment of the type of religious belief that makes people, who are proud, independent, afraid, and starving, show no compassion but think the worst of each other, even their own children. This is a very powerful film that is in many ways an indictment of and explanation for the callous and rigid religious fanaticism that America was founded on. I have only one criticism \u2013 in his pursuit of mood and realism, Eggers let the actors slur their words, confusing the audience about what exactly is going on more than necessary. The director only got away with this because we are probably as familiar with the tales of witchcraft in colonial New England as we are with Jack the Ripper."

It started out OK- excellent creepiness when The Witch of the Wood stole the baby, but that's where the horror ended.  The rest was a drawn out \"beautifully crafted\" drama typical of independent movies- but the only thing I was scared of, was falling asleep.  It appeared the cast and crew made a true effort to recreate the detail of the time period.  The acting, costumes, set design were all good.  The only reason I'm rating this movie as a disappointment is because it was sold as something else and didn't deliver."

      "text": "The Witch is a good movie, but it also has a very narrow audience. For those that love slow, yet tense, horror films that are as bizarre as they are scary, this film is for you. The Witch is unnerving, super realistic, and wacky to a fault. I will say that the film\u2019s writer and director Robert Eggers did an amazing job for a directorial debut, and he is undoubtedly a force to watch in the future.\r From the opening scene of the film to the very end the film is unnerving. The film is quite slow, but never really boring, because the filmmakers did a great job creating a very tense tone. The tone is essentially formed from three major elements of the movie, the bone-chilling music, the ominous cinematography (especially in the forest), and the always noticeable presence of darkness lurking. In this film the titular character isn\u2019t in the film often, but their presence is felt. Combine that with the excruciating attention to detail, and the film takes on a sense of reality.\r The film is extremely realistic, and that is because Eggers took the time, and had the attention to detail to make the film as realistic as possible. While the dialogue may distract some, it is exactly how people used to talk in the colonial era. The lighting is usually dim, but is to is realistic as the film is literally made to look as if it\u2019s being lit by candlelight or moonlight. The actors were on point, most likely due to great direction, and the sets were almost exactly what one would expect things to look like back then. That kind of dedication, deserves respect, but it also helps the audience get lost in the filmic world.\r However, the film is downright wacky, and in some ways that\u2019s great, and in others it hurt the film a little. The film is unlike anything I\u2019ve ever seen before, in an interview Eggers said his original pitch was \u201ctoo weird, or too obscure\u201d considering the film he made, I want to see that film because this one was wonderfully obscure and weird. However, the film was a little hard to follow, at times it felt as though too many things would happen in a short period filled with moments of confusion, which did help reinforce the insanity the characters were growing into, but made it harder to follow.\rIt may not have helped the film, but as an observation, the film was devoid of humor. In the end, the film is original, unnerving, realistic, very well made, but does have an obscure feeling to it. The cinematography is beautiful, the filmmakers had an amazing attention to detail, and horror fans will most likely like the film. If you like the wacky, weird, obscure horror films that don\u2019t rely on cliches and jump scares, check this film out."

      "text": "If you want to see an original, intensely atmospheric and horrifying film and you have a strong constitution for suffering on a new level then the Witch is the film for you. Wrath of God induced Paranoia - check. Bleak cinematography that captures the mood perfectly - check. Painstaking attention to detail in terms of the period - check - superb acting from everyone - check. Be warned, this isn't a mainstream film out to give you a warm tingly feeling or hold your hand and give you all the answers. It was made with the sole purpose of disturbing you on every level -  which it achieves perfectly. Think of 'The Road,' just with a Witch and without Viggo."
