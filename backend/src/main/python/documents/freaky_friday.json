Mark Harmon is among the cast."

I loved that they used humor, or throughout the movie but also touched your heartstrings. It addresses a problem that nowadays mother and daughter relationships are on a strain. At the end of the movie, I felt like hugging my mother. I recommend it for any family movie night!"

      "text": "I enjoyed this film, and I do slightly prefer it to the Jodie Foster version. True, the first 15 minutes were a bit slow, and some of the script was a bit weak, not to mention the rather predictable storyline. But you know what, the performances of Lindsey Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis more than compensated, their performances were really entertaining, and I felt the chemistry between them. I loved the soundtrack, and I thought it was very sensible updating the story, so that it would appeal more to someone like my 13 year old sister, who really enjoyed it. The script, while contrived in some places, was on the whole, very funny, and anyone who's seen the 1976 film, will get a more of the same film, except updated. What I did like, is that Lohan's character is a representation of all of us, someone who doesn't do mornings, doesn't always get on with her mum, and has friends and enemies. In the 1976 version, Jodie Foster's interpretation was more sensible than Lohan's, who put a bit of her other films in, which is quite appealing for this sort of film. Overall, an enjoyable film, with a 7/10. Bethany Cox"

Lindsay Lohan and Jaimie Lee Curtis\u2019 acting and chemistry were great. It was funny watching Jaimie Lee Curtis act like a teenager and watching Lindsay Lohan act like an adult. They were funny in this movie. This movie is so nostalgic to me. I never saw the original Freaky Friday and never read the book, but this movie seems like a good remake and adaptation. Whoever would\u2019ve guessed Lindsay Lohan can both act AND sing very well? The horrendous 2018 Disney Channel original movie reboot of Freaky Friday doesn\u2019t hold a candle to this! The 2003 version is the best Freaky Friday movie!"

Jake is so sick lol, falling in love with your crush's mom is so weird, but it shows how he likes Anna for who she is; Her taste, her way to think, the bands she likes... Leaving tthe funny on the side, it also teach us an important lesson."
