Chu, the film editor Stan Salfas and visual effects supervisor Matt Johnson had their work cut out for them and they all succeeded as did the actors from Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Daniel Radcliffe, Lizzy Caplan, Jay Chou, Sanaa Lathan, David Warshofsky, Tsai Chin to the good, always reliable, veterans Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine. The only misstep is Woody Harrelson's twin but you'll have to see the movie to know what I am talking about though, looking back, it may not have been a misstep.\r \"Now You See Me 2\" is just for sheer entertainment though at 129 minutes it is asking a bit too much from the audience. It may not make sense, it may be all over the place--and world--but it has laughs, suspense, a lot of noise, some thinking for nerds, enough action for fight and chase seekers, even a hinted at love story and certainly an ending that leave a \"Now You See Me\" open for another sequel!"}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Although not quite up to par with its predecessor, as sequels go, this followup to its fun, playful parent is nevertheless entertaining throughout, albeit a bit overlong and, at times, a little forced.

The cast were as good as ever, with Mark Ruffalo, Jesse Eisenberg and Morgan Freeman in particular, adding to their characters and making them more interesting.

There was a good balence between humour and thrills as well. Bottom Line: if you enjoyed the first one, you'll probably enjoy this. If not, you probably won't think much of it.

This film is just one more, and it followed one of the best, to reveal itself as one of the worst.The story is simple: after the events of the first film, the Horsemen separate and wait for instructions from the Eye. However, if some get tired and give up, others insist. Finally, they are summoned to expose the secrets of a new technological application but everything goes wrong: exposed to the world, they flee and end up in Macau, where they will have to find out who is the person who betrayed them.What can I say about this film? That many of the most interesting and entertaining features of the first film have simply disappeared. Director Jon M. Chu was able to reveal himself to be a nullity by making a hasty film, full of unrealistic and imaginative situations, as well as clich\u00e9s like the evil twin or the illegitimate son who wants to please his father. Even as a piece of entertainment, this film is quite weak and unable to honor its predecessor.The cast is inherited from the previous film, with few modifications, but they are at a distance from giving us a good job because they weren't entitled to some decent material. So, we have again Jesse Eisenberg, more arrogant than in the first film, James Franco and Woody Harrelson, who will also give life to his character's presumptuous twin brother (a stupid script option, at the very least). Mark Ruffalo, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine also returned to their characters, and I would say that they are the best actors here. The problem is that they could not do anything to improve the film given that they did not have much visibility (Freeman and Ruffalo, who appear only when necessary, are really underused sometimes). The exit of Isla Fisher (quite intelligent given that she saved herself from a film that would not add anything good to her career) was filled by the entrance of Lizzy Caplan, as a fun character that makes you smile, adding moments of spontaneity and irreverence to a film that, without it, would be more boring. The villain was incarnated by Daniel Radcliffe, but he looks like a cynical caricature, and I was never able to take him seriously.Technically, it's a fairly regular film: on the positive side, I would highlight cinematography, with a good work of light and color, enhanced by the authentic color of the streets of Macau, a former Portuguese colony in China where much of the film takes place. The sets and costumes are good enough and there is some realism and verisimilitude in CGI and in visual and sound effects. The soundtrack, it seemed to me, is inherited from the previous film with few modifications."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "This movie has to many good actors but the story is a waste of time!

There's no real build-up, there's no investment from me personally because I already know that everything happening in the movie is done with CGI, and it's all so predictable.

It's more excessive with it's visuals and more over the top with it's plot and tricks.

That being said, it's not without it's entertaining moments.\r Things like Woody Harrelson's delightful double performance and the inclusion of the always wonderful Daniel Radcliffe are greatly appreciated. Lizzy Caplan joining the cast is not. Meant to be the comedic relief, Caplan's character ends up being grating instead.\r The plot itself is fine, but it's beats are familiar. It tries to fit in so many different twists and character reveals that it just feels too packed that it's hard to care about everything going on. Maybe it's time to trim down on the number of heroes and villains here.\r Mark Ruffalo gets the majority of the attention here. His character is left with the more serious side of the plot, while Eisenberg and the rest of the horsemen are left to wander around and pull off flashy tricks. Considering they're the ones doing the cool stuff, perhaps we should've been focusing on them.\r So how is the magic in this sequel? That is, after all, the biggest part of the movie. Well, quite frankly they are stunning. There are a lot of cool, crazy things happening onscreen. It's the one part where the movie goes bigger and actually does end up with something better. It also doesn't skimp out on the explanations either. Things like an extended card throwing sequence (not exactly magic, but still cool) and Eisenberg controlling the rain are a treat to watch. The only problem is that it's biggest trick is one you can see coming from a mile away.\r When it comes to the flash, spectacle, and magic tricks this sequel doesn't let viewers down. However when it comes to the plot holding it together it stumbles. Quite a few of it's reveals are obvious and familiar. It's big ending trick is one you'll know how it plays out.
