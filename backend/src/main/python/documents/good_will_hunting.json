It also stresses the importance of getting your emotional stuff in order.  Untill that was in order, he had no faith in himself.  I guess your environment really really determines that.

So yeah this movie is another one that everyone should see because the way Matt Damon and Ben Affleck this art is that they fake you out in the beginning making you think it\u2019a a comedy but then you get introduced to Robin\u2019s character and then the movie flips into a drama. So the main person I really want to bring light on is Robin because he is so amazing in this roll he goes from being a humble person to grabbing Matt\u2019s character by the neck and that\u2019s what makes him feel more real, he has emotions and with his perfect performance he brings weight to a certain type of character and I don\u2019t think I can ever unsee the way he plays him and I don\u2019t want to either.

Somebody puts a code on my desk, something nobody else can break. Maybe I take a shot at it and maybe I break it. And I'm real happy with myself, 'cause I did my job well. But maybe that code was the location of some rebel army in North Africa or the Middle East. Once they have that location, they bomb the village where the rebels were hiding and fifteen hundred people I never met, never had no problem with, get killed. Now the politicians are sayin', \"Oh, send in the Marines to secure the area\" 'cause they don't give a **** It won't be their kid over there, gettin' shot. Just like it wasn't them when their number got called, 'cause they were pullin' a tour in the National Guard. It'll be some kid from Southie takin' shrapnel in the ass. And he comes back to find that the plant he used to work at got exported to the country he just got back from. And the guy who put the shrapnel in his ass got his old job, 'cause he'll work for fifteen cents a day and no bathroom breaks. Meanwhile, he realizes the only reason he was over there in the first place was so we could install a government that would sell us oil at a good price. And, of course, the oil companies used the skirmish over there to scare up domestic oil prices. A cute little ancillary benefit for them, but it ain't helping my buddy at two-fifty a gallon. And they're takin' their sweet time bringin' the oil back, of course, and maybe even took the liberty of hiring an alcoholic skipper who likes to drink martinis and **** play slalom with the icebergs, and it ain't too long 'til he hits one, spills the oil and kills all the sea life in the North Atlantic. So now my buddy's out of work and he can't afford to drive, so he's got to walk to the **** job interviews, which sucks 'cause the shrapnel in his ass is givin' him chronic hemorrhoids. And meanwhile he's starvin', 'cause every time he tries to get a bite to eat, the only blue plate special they're servin' is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker State. So what did I think? I'm holdin' out for somethin' better. I figure **** it, while I'm at it why not just shoot my buddy, take his job, give it to his sworn enemy, hike up gas prices, bomb a village, club a baby seal, hit the hash pipe and join the National Guard?

The story is predictable but what makes it enjoyable are the characters, the acting, and the relationships (particularly Will\u2019s relationship with Williams\u2019 character as well as his relationship with Ben Affleck\u2019s character). It\u2019s a nice feel good movie. My only issues come from the last third/fourth of the movie where we have to sit through a lot of arguing as well as moping and doping even though its obvious that the film will end on a happy note and what that note will be specifically. Since this is a Robin Williams movie where he plays a teacher that inspires a pupil, I feel its fair to compare it to Dead Poet\u2019s Society, which is a better film. I found the arc of the students\u2019 in that film to be far more interesting and I like how the happy ending comes at the cost of some tragedy. Additionally, that film was not as predictable. With all that said though I still enjoy Good Will Hunting it\u2019s a heart-warming film with a good message that pulls at your heart strings. It makes you laugh and cry as well as remember a time when cell phones did not exist and the Dunkin Donuts logo looked different. It is clich\u00e9 and predictable but I\u2019m willing to overlook it because the characters are likeable and the relationships are fantastic especially in the first half (second half/third is where the clich\u00e9s fall in).

But now it is evident that Matt Damon deserved his Oscar nomination for his portrayal of the title character, the good Will Hunting.\r Damon does a yeoman's job making us believe in someone who is not only a math genius with a photographic memory, but a barroom-brawler, cynic, janitor, lover, and all-around down-to-earth working-class Joe. Damon and his compadre Ben Affleck also deserved their Oscar screenplay win for creating a character more fantastic than any from the mind of J.R.R. Tolkien.\r Robin Williams also deserved his Oscar win for having us buy his interpretation of an all-knowing beard-sporting eye-glinting joke-cracking-but-no-nonsense psychologist.\r Affleck, director Gus Van Sant, and the rest of the cast merit mention as well for trying to get us to like and accept all the unappealing and implausible characters who populate this fantasy world.\r All this leads me to believe that I should revisit films like Showgirls, The River Wild, Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, and The Greek Tycoon. Maybe I was a little too harsh in my initial assessment of these as well."

To begin with, the story is not only a wonderful concept but also devoid of idealistic clich\u00c3\u00a9.  It was the kind of story that carried itself through the journey; situations fabricated to nudge the plot along were very sparse.  The entire movie flowed out smoothly, avoiding the impression of multiple disjointed scenes, instead following a cohesive line of thought, and yet integrated within was a well-paced emotional rampage.
