The premise is that if someone becomes single they are sent to a resort for 45 days and if they do not find a partner they are turned into an animal of their choosing. They are also given extra days at the resort for shooting someone from the loner community (people who have escaped from the resort) . In this dystopian society, both the resort and the loner society are highly regimented and violent if rules are not followed... The film is mainly a satire on relationships and although we so desire to connect we often fail because we often cannot empathize with the one we have chosen. .Also, In order to connect  we sometimes attempt to make ourselves into copies of the other person, a tactic that often fails. The film portrayed how difficult it is to  empathize with a partner unless we share some characteristic, and because that often is impossible the relationship is doomed.. The film makes big statements and smaller ones and all of them are profound, sometimes funny and sometimes very sad. It satirizes the current dating scene by portraying its superficiality, but also satirizes and makes a grim statement about relationships in general, and society which offers us opportunities to conform or rebel, neither of which is effective.

The idea that a pair of people, who, due to a dystopian world and a sadistic, \"leader\" end up having to become blind to find \"true love\"  is just utterly ridiculous. This dystopia,  where being single is illegal,  going into relationship \"rehab\" places you in a joyless relationship, with your only other two options being made into a mutant animal, (ala the islnd of Dr Moreau), or living in the woods with a manipulative, sickening, cowardly, murderous woman, who could not evenn do battle with a woman she blinded, is just beyond depressing. Its sadistic and indescribable, at least to me. It was long, boring, depressing, with no redemptive features, whatsoever. If, perhaps, the couple had things to atone for, in their previous relationships, then, at least, their would be a story here.\rI felt that there was probably an alternate ending, or endings filmed, in which you would see Farrell's character, walking away from Weisz's character, in the restaurant background, might have been interesting, but even more depressing.

At its center is the notion that modern society's pressure to pair off and mate is SO STRONG that it is basically equivalent to a hotel where you are forced to pair off or be turned into an animal. Also you're forced to hunt lonely people with tranquilizer guns, because why not! The entire premise strikes me as melodramatic and self-sorry (think film school loner that can't get a girlfriend), and relies on cheap shocks that arrive with predictable regularity. It basically has the plot of a bad anime mixed with the effete and somber filmography of Beyonce's Lemonade. So at the very least, it's pretty.

Their friends had highly suggested the movie, so we made an outing of it. I\u2019m not especially fond of R rated movies, and the plot seemed thin, but perhaps humorous, and I convinced myself to have an open mind, and try something new.\rWe all regretted watching this movie and afterwards agreed: if we had been watching this at home we would have stopped after twenty minutes. I knew very little about this movie coming in, but if it was meant to be science-fiction, I saw no science; if romantic, these themes were lost in its bizarre mood similar to how pungent, rancid flavors destroy delicate ones \u2013 and if comedic, then only to those who can purge themselves of compassion and empathy.\rThis movie is at best a bitter, twisted satire. I pity the people who saw marriage in such a dystopian light that they could conceive such a story. While I agree that there are many things amiss with today\u2019s standards for marriage and relationships, this movie went too far. For example, in this movie:\r\u2022\tEven in their desperation, people relied on insignificant, superficial similarities to find \u2018mates\u2019:\rA limp, frequent nosebleeds, perfect hair, emotions or lack thereof, shortsightedness, and finally blindness \u2013 criteria that lead to the pursuit of hollow, shallow, and altogether meaningless relationships, save one near the end; but even that one was plagued by this practice.\r\u2022\tSingle people where adamantly reminded of their \u2018misery\u2019 and given lessons in the \u2018importance,\u2019 or rather, the \u2018benefits\u2019 of being in a relationship while at the hotel, which also made it its business to encourage and engage its occupant in sexual habits that they deemed beneficial and prohibit and punish those they considered damaging to \u2018relationships\u2019.\r\u2022\tBrutality, however, is apparently under standard trade laws and thus monopolies are prohibited. The Loners, the alternative to society, make many allowances that the hotel and society at large prohibit whilst they live in exile. In stark contrast to the rest of the society, Loners are expected to be alone permanently: you can talk, you can come, you can go, but any sign of sexuality, of attachment, even something as fleeting as flirting, will be severely and mercilessly punished, and their leader is the typical sadistic, manipulating, power hungry psychopath that these types of movies seem to breed.\rAre we superficial? Yes, we are. Do we feel pressure to be in a relationship? To have a \u2018significant other\u2019? All the time. Is the world cruel? It goes without saying. Are we all flawed? Of course we are. Do we really need a movie to tell us this in some bizarre, twisted fashion? The fact that these types of movies are on the rise is itself a satire against society. But does exacerbating the issue like this do anything? Would a doctor ever suggest rubbing filth and excrement into a wound as part of a treatment? \u2013 it would only make matters worse, and satires like this have the same effect.\rIf you want to help society, if you want to see it healed, you have to teach people what it means to be good, not chastise and mock them for what they didn\u2019t know was wrong. And to do that you need to show them what it means to be good, to be wholly loved. As Antione de Saint-Exupery said, if you want to build a ship, don\u2019t drum up people to collect wood and assign them tasks and work; teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea.

That's not a reason to hate it. Alcoholic drinks taste bad to children. The Lobster is a wonderfully unique script that is also thrilling, funny, romantic, and best of all thoughtful and thought-provoking. Person above me writes \"maybe it makes some valid points about absurd societal norms...\" Why, yes. Yes it does. And if you let the movie take you, you'd see it was quite profound. This is a movie for the advanced viewer and it hits the bullseye in everything that has been missing from mainstream film for years."}], "recommendations": ["the_wolf_of_wall_street", "children_of_men", "babel", "antebellum", "vivarium", "crash", "mother", "the_butterfly_effect", "downsizing", "chappie", "lost_in_translation", "apocalypto", "colossal", "midsommar", "swiss_army_man", "v_for_vendetta", "fifty_shades_darker", "the_shape_of_water", "the_counselor", "boyhood", "nerve", "slumdog_millionaire", "donnie_darko", "the_darkest_minds", "lucy"]}
