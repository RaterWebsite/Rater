      "text": "Jeff Jefferies is a photographer who likes to spy on the lives of his neighbors through the rear windows, until it begins to suspect that one of them killed his wife. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, is written by John Michael Hayes, with the participation of James Stewart and Grace Kelly.This is one of the most famous films of Hitchcock and has been several remakes target. Like many of the films of this director, it could almost be staged as a play, given that almost all the action takes place in the same place: the apartment of the protagonist. The script is excellent, although moments of too much predictability. The performance of the main actors is impeccable and striking, and I consider this one of the best films of Kelly's career. The photograph also deserves a very positive note. The rest (soundtrack, costumes, scenery etc.) is reasonable without surprise or particular attention.I always heard people talk of this movie when it came in Hitchcock's name. But to see the film, I was of the opinion that this director did some more interesting and remarkable films. Either way, it's a good movie, it is worth to be seen and appreciated, and that will please a lot to most suspense fans or thrillers."

The incredibly talented Kelly, plays his frustrated but devoted girlfriend who Jefferies needs to convince that he has witnessed a serious crime from his window."

This film definitely deserves to be at the top of the Best Movies list."

      "text": "One of those instances where the movie is outdated for me. I'm not young by any stretch, but I find difficulty in engaging these older films. I also think, dare I say it, Hitchcock is not a director I'd put on my top 10 list. I won't say I don't like his movies, but I'm not an avid fan. I got one of the box sets and found myself bored through most of the movies, this one included. Sure, the color themes are intriguing, but I've seen so much better use of color. This is the issue I have with these groundbreaking films; the ground was broken so long ago, they have been oft imitated."

      "text": "Rear Window is a one of the more sophisticated Hitchcock films, and I will always consider it a masterpiece. It has tension, suspense, humour, has a strong voyeuristic tone to it and moves along at a good pace. The cinematography was truly excellent, dark in some scenes and beautiful in another. The script is fantastic and genuinely memorable(Thelma Ritter's wisecracks especially), likewise with the story, about a man who is convinced that his neighbour has killed his wife. I have always considered Rear Window's main merit to be the performance of James Stewart, he was perfect as Jeff, the man who is in a wheelchair, due to a broken leg. The other performances go without fault either, especially from the beautiful Grace Kelly as Lisa and Raymond Burr in a chilling performance as \"the villain of the piece,\" Mr Thorwold. The music was expressive and atmospheric courtesy of Franz Waxman, and the climax was possibly the highlight of the film, after Stewart's performance. The 1954 version of Rear Window will always be a classic, not the inferior TV remake with Christopher Reeve. All in all, a must see for those who are fans of Hitchcock. 10/10 Bethany Cox."

Static settings demand for things such as cinematography, writing and performances to have to be at their best as they are the story, what keeps attention.  Hitchcock is stunning at creating sublime story's that simmer and build into thrilling crescendos and rear window is his best example of that with his idiosyncratic camerawork swoops like the voyeur the main character is. Grace Kelly is an engrossing independent brave socialite reporter and Stewart a cynical photographer but Ritter stands out as the sharp wit nurse. The script is exceptionally well written . Not the best film I've seen but it's right there."

Throughout the film there is a constant state of suspense that is aided by convincing performances from Jimmy Stewart, Grace Kelly, and Thelma Ritter. Although this film is often overshadowed by better known Hitchcock films such as Vertigo and Psycho, this film still remains a must see for anyone as an absolute classic that should be in consideration for the greatest film ever made."

What I got was way greater than I'd ever imagined. The film has interesting characters, great suspense, and an interesting plotline all from one room. On top of that it still holds up really well for a film made 60+ years ago. The one point deduction is more of a personal profession, since there are other movies that I just enjoy watching more."

Its interesting how Jeff (the main character) interprets the observations he witnesses. Its all a case of context, I suppose. Hearing him query other peoples interpretations of what he saw made me doubt the truth behind the circumstances. Its definitely a strong case of armchair detective, of course (how could it not?). It features a strong performance from both James Stewart and Grace Kelly, who is quick to challenge his assumptions. It makes me wonder what do others read in to otherwise seemingly every day activities and observations?. Its a slow builder, plot wise but it does well at pulling the audience in, questioning things.Its an intriguing watch, I found surprisingly tense, so I'd recommend it."

From killing time to voyeuristic voyeurism, Lisa and nurses strongly opposed to involuntarily join in. The audience nervously followed the development of the plot, confirming the voyeurism deeply rooted in everyone's heart."

Movie tries to confuse you due to which you are unable to predict the ending. One thing that I didn't like about the story was that there needed to be proper explaination at the end.

One grand narrative with a few interesting side-narratives to make it interesting. Only complaint is that it all wrapped up so quickly with a neat little bow on top. And Jeffries' paranoia and chauvinism is rewarded in the end. Blah.Dialogue: 9/10...funny, intriguing, with a deep sea of meaning hidden beneath the surface of the words.Performances: 8/10...basically a stageplay on screen, which delivered some pretty predictable stage-acting performances from several characters. Kelly and Stewart are phenomenal (Kelly especially), but the other characters all LOOK like they are acting.Misc.: 10/10...Hitchcock is just masterful with the camerawork, editing, score, lighting. All the subtle stuff you aren't supposed to notice isn't noticeable, which is what makes it noteworthy! Phenomenal directing.Overall: 9/10...a few parts age quite poorly, but it's clearly a masterpiece and the inspiration for so many single-set movies that followed in it's wake."
