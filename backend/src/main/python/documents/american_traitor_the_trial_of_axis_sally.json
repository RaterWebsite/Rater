      "text": "Axis Sally was the name of the character who broadcast entertainment and Nazi propaganda to Americans at home and in the military during World War II. This film follows the woman (Meadow Williams) who was brought back to the States to be tried for treason. Williams\u2019 portrayal is flat, lacking any real charisma as Sally or much emotion as the real person. However, it\u2019s Al Pacino as her lawyer, who gets to soak up all the attention with his now-typical crusty eccentric portrayal. The narrative jumps regularly between the Berlin events and the US trial (and how did she maintain access to all that makeup and those many dresses while in prison?), but never creates much dramatic momentum. It\u2019s interesting as a historical curiosity, but rather lackluster as a movie."

      "rating": "4",
      "text": "A less overly sympathetic portrayal would have made for a more compelling film. The film biggest mistake is that it fails to truly unpack the main character's motivation for the treasonous act.Also, the casting of the lead could have been better. There's a story worth telling here. Unfortunately it was poorly told. In the end it was like watching a rushed film adaptation of a Danielle Steel novel."
