Jodie drives the audience nuts, as she tries to desperately find her child, who's missing on a plane. Not only is she a little too worried, but comes off as being really annoying. Even throwing a weird twist didn't make the movie better. Instead, it was like a clone of The Village (movie with false advertising and was more disappointing than the 50 second trailer). The only positive side to the movie was that they used Sean Bean as the captain of the flight. Very genius, no Boromir indeed, but still impressive. In conclusion, I totally recommend you DO NOT see this movie."

[***SPOILERS***] When Jodie Foster starts freaking out about her missing daughter and all the people around her doubt she even has a daughter, much less one who boarded the plane, the plot fell apart. Why didn't the character played by Jodie Foster suggest that someone contact the grandparents, with whom she and her little girl planned to live once they arrived in the U.S.? Were there no school, doctor or other records that could prove the daughter's existence? The captain could have initiated an inquiry to ascertain that, at the very least, there WAS a daughter. Did the Jodie Foster character have no friends that could be contacted to verify that Foster had booked a flight back to the states with her little girl? How was the flight booked? If by a travel agent, couldn't that person or firm confirm a booking for the little girl? If by a website, wouldn't there be a record of the number of tickets purchased by the Jodie Foster character in the website's database? I'm sorry, but if a plot is not believable, I stop caring. Other posters here have described other plot holes, but these very early ones pushed me out of this movie very early on. Scriptwriters should plug plot holes and not assume the audience is stupid. A plot that is implausible throws me right out of the movie. Too bad. Some good acting talent on view, and the direction and editing were good in my opinion. But the plot - the story - is central for me. If it fails, the movie fails."

      "text": "Jodie Foster is \"mother panic\" in movies like Flightplan and Panic Room. She is quite believable in these roles. The movie is initially captivating as it places the viewer in the same position employed in Ron Howard's \"A Beautiful Mind.\" In Flightplan we actually begin to believe we may be participating in a schizophrenic break from reality. Sadly, we are rapidly brought back into the reality of a predictable plot and \"Hollywoodesque\" ending. The stereotyping of Arabs is too important an issue to assign to the few scenes allocated in this movie. This issue would have been better served with these scenes on the editiing room floor. They were obviously forced into the plot to reveal how easily we engage in stereotypical behavior. If I were an Arab these scenes would cause me to leave the theater feeling as though the dangerous harrassment I often experience could be easily erradicated if \"I\" offered the offender their purse.\" Either deal with the issue in an informative, intriguing manner or let another film bring it to life. This feeble attempt still left me wondering if \"they\" (an often dangerous word) were still connected to the abduction. This film had enough fuel to hold my interest. Still, Flightplan never reached the altitude potentially possible through Foster's fine acting."

      "text": "If Jodie Foster is only going to treat us to a film performance every three years or so, she'd be better advised to join forces with Robert DeNiro for Taxi Driver: 30 Years Later, in which Travis Bickle and Iris reunite and join forces to blast away panhandlers, jaywalkers and other vermin infesting the streets of Rudolph Giuliani's Disneyfied New York than to do anything like this laughably contrived, ridiculously ineffective Panic Room In The Sky. She plays a distraught mom transporting her recently deceased husband's body from Germany to the U.S.; things get complicated when she loses her little daughter on the flight and even more so when questions arise among the crew and other passengers as to whether the child ever existed in the first place. Much justifiable complaining has already been done about the film's final act, and I won't divulge any of it for you--not because it's not nice to print spoilers, but because there's more than enough, uh, love to spread around to cover this movie's ENTIRE 93 minutes!! For starters, setting the action on a superjet half the size of Delaware is comletely nonconducive to suspense; the people who made the 1952 cop-on-a-train thriller The Narrow Margin, the original Speed, and the current Red Eye were all intensely aware of a simple but necessary component in transportation-based thrillers that Flightplan is obviously, completely unaware of: claustrophobia. (Put it this way: spending half the movie's running time thinking about what the Zucker Brothers could've done with the Ponderosa-sized set doesn't exactly whiten my knuckles.) The flight crew and personnel are, to a one, depicted as so thoroughly insensitive to Foster's situation that I'm surprised that more flight attendants aren't picketing theaters showing this movie for defamation of character than conservative Christians protested The Last Temptation Of Christ back in 1988! For that matter, of the 400-plus passengers, isn't it within the realm of possibility that at least a few of them (especially the other parents on board) would treat Foster with some compassion and consideration rather than responding to the admittedly unique circumstances with complete selfishness and heartlessness--even if their plans WERE being disrupted? (Don't get me started on Flightplan's shoddy and offensive exploitation of post 9/11 fears of Arab passengers.) The movie's use of astonishingly unbellievable coincidences not only breaks several simple dramatic laws but invents new ones to mercilessly stomp on; in Speed, having Sandra Bullock ride the bus because she had her license revoked, making her the perfect candidate to keep the bus going over 50 mph was a believable and pleasing piece of serendipity; having Foster be this plane's architect and therefore know every place to look is contrived beyond forgiveness. (Or, as Saturday Night Live's Church Lady would've said, \"How con-VEEEEE-nient!\") You can't fault Foster's very effectively tense performance at all (the fact that she fights like a girl notwithstanding) except that it's utterly wasted in the service of such disgracefully substandard material: watching her here is like seeing a world-class concert violinist performing in a Chuck E. Cheese's. On the other hand, Peter Sarsgaard, normally a terrific actor (Kinsey, Garden State, Shattered Glass) is currently the leading candidate for2005's Nails-On-The-Blackboard award for his surprisingly irritating impersonation of an alternately sympathetic and suspicious air marshal, and would someone please remove the Scotch tape from his eyelids? Of course, the possibility exists that I'm completely misreading this movie, and perhaps everything that's wrong with it should be interpreted as a microcosm for all the troubles that the airline industry has faced in the last few years. If that's the case, perhaps the same advice applies to spending good money on first-class flights AND an evening centered around Flightplan: Fly coach instead."

I found the movie to be interesting, and as I said, it kept you guessing through the whole thing...yet it doesn't move fast enough. It's never really as suspenseful or thrilling as it wants to be. The movie resorts to cheap tricks to try to fool you; characters giving eachother suspicious glances when (in retrospect) they had no reason to, etc. It was an interesting movie, but overall, it's only average, and as a thriller, it just doesn't thrill."

      "text": "Suspenseful movies are often compared to roller-coaster rides because the twists and turns and ups and downs are what make watching them such a thrill. The problem with \"Flightplan\" is that it is like a roller-coaster with only one hill. [***SPOILERS***] The tension builds steadily from the beginning, where we aree treated with fractured, inter-woven images of a grieving aeronautics engineer named Kyle Pratt who has lost her husband to a fall from the roof of their residence in Berlin. She is escorting her traumatized daughter Julia home to America, along with her husband in a casket. When the exhausted and emotionally frazzled mother falls asleep on the plane she helped design, she wakes to find Julia missing. At first she is calm and prudent in her search of the luxurious two-story jumbo jet. It's only when she cannot find her daughter, and not a single one of the passengers or crew admits seeing the child ever come on board that we begin to question Kyle's hold on reality. The flight attendents begin to think she's delusional, and the captain discovers evidence she very well might be. But we *saw* Julia board the plane. Or did we? \"Flightplan\" forces the audience as well (as the sleepy-eyed Air Marshall Carson played by Peter Sarsgaard) to ask several hard questions. How can a 6-year-old girl vanish mid-flight on an airplane? Why would someone even hatch such a plan? What makes Julia, or her mother, so special? When the reasons are revealed and the villain of the movie are finally unmasked is when this roller-coaster plummets towards the earth and never quite recovers. The underlying plot that threatens Pratt and her daughter is so outlandish and unecessarily elaborate that one might believe Rube Goldberg was the mastermind behind it all. Suspension of disbelief is not enough to save us from wishing the ride was simply over. What saves the film at all is the superb acting from Jodie Foster and Sean Bean. Foster always appears to be riding the edge of hysteria and madness, yet she skillfully manipulates the circumstances, the crew and Sarsgaard's air marshall to find her daughter. She never for a moment doubts what she is doing, and that means we can not be sure she is fully enveloped in her own grief-fed delusion. Sean Bean, who normally plays villains, is the firm and unflappable master of the airplane who knows he is responsible for the 400+ lives on the plane yet understands that Foster's character is one of those lives. He matches Pratt's unwavering dedication point for point and serves as a much better foil than Carson, whose role is mostly relegated to glowering at Pratt like a surly guard dog. \"Flightplan\" borrows heavily from the classic Hitchcock film \"The Lady Vanishes\", but it cannot live up to the master of suspense. In \"Flightplan\"s case, it's the plot that ends up vanishing."
