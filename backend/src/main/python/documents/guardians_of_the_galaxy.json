Definitely the funniest marvel movie I've seen so far, though very different than what they've been doing. It's an ensemble sci-fi adventure comedy with clever dialogue and a memorable cast of characters. Similar group dynamic to what we saw in the avengers, made all the more impressive by the fact that they haven't had several movies to introduce the characters.\rIt has very little to do with the avengers specifically and instead widens the lens to encompass the greater marvel universe, making use of characters and alien races we've seen bits and pieces of before (most notably in the Thor films). The tone is very unique, bouncing effortlessly back and forth between comedy and genuine drama with an array of action scenes in a wide variety of set pieces.\rIf you've been following the marvel movies so far, you'll want to see this since it helps to expand the cinematic universe while setting the stage for the future avengers films (though in some ways it feels like it's setting up Avengers 3 more than 2). On the other hand, if you haven't been following the franchise very consistently or not at all, it still works as an adventure movie. The main characters have little or nothing to do with any of the movies so far, and while there are one or two faces we've seen before, especially in the villain department, you won't need to know them to be able to enjoy it. There's an important macguffin that ties into the larger story, but it's basically just there to drive the plot along. If anyone has been living in a cave somewhere for the past ten years or so, I'd be interested to hear what someone who hasn't watched any of the marvel movies thought of this."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I just saw guardians of the Galaxy and all I can think is WOW.

OH WELLL I GUESS THIS IS MY CUE TO START LAUGHING SINCE EVERYBODY ELSE IS LAUGHING. it got to the point where people were laughing and snickering at every tidbit in the movie, cause they thought that part was supposed to be a cue for the audience to laugh. nobody knew what was and what wasn't supposed to be funny!\r I guess I could call the humor in this movie DRY HUMOR cause the jokes are executed with a lack of exaggeration, and dry humor doesn't make me laugh out loud. dry humor just tells my mind that im supposed to be laughing at something.\r and that's what this movie fails at ultimately. this movie is a **** joke! never once was I worried about these evil guys destroying and taking over the galaxy! I was never worried! I was never at the edge of my seat! the movie didn't fill me with intensity and epic feelings! I couldn't because everybody was too busy laughing at each other and making a joke out of everything! soooo I wasn't laughing, I wasn't at the edge of seat in intensity, this movie just fails all around!\r the only good part of this movie was the somewhat epic ending with the bad guy, but even that got ruined with an attempted funny joke. the ending battle did get me laughing, cause it was so ridiculous you had to laugh. sooo this movie did make me genuinely laugh ONE TIME! but in doing so it ruined a totally epic battle that this movie had going at the time! soooo they sacrificed an epic final battle for a laugh. good choice director.\r overall, special effects were amazing, the only good thing about this movie. some touching moments here and there, a somewhat epic final battle, and you got yourselves a satisfactory, mediocre, marvel movie. lol goddamn marvel movies have been going downhill lately. seriously I would only watch this if you got nothing else to do on the weekend, but im pretty sure you can find things to do a lot better than this average film lol"}, {"rating": "1", "text": "It was memories of a joyless screening of Captain America that made me approach this new Marvel adventure with caution. A caution borne of years of instinctive experience of crass movies aimed at the lowest possible denominator. I make it a rule never to walk out of any film, but in between admiring the face of my watch and battling yawns with as much zeal as our eclectic on screen heroes were battling each other, I very nearly succumbed to breaking with this self enforcement. The film starts badly and never recovers. One of the most mis- judged elements is the vein of humour running throughout that is puerile, lacking the benefit of any real wit or genuine laughs.\rThe story may be simple but there is so much superfluous chatter to draw out the running time that it becomes a language unto itself, which is probably only decipherable by teenage boys or others interested in all things 'Star Wars'. Trying to emulate that 70's classic, and I use the term loosely, the film has its own double act comprising of a very vocal racoon and a selfless tree who are clearly modelled on the characters of R2D2 and C3PO.\rThe cast enthusiastically inject more energy into the material than it deserves, but one remains baffled as to what actors of the calibre of Glenn Close and John C Reilly are doing participating in this nonsense.\r Technically the film is outstanding. Cinematography and Special Visual effects are on the money and the Production Design is striking even if one set looks suspiciously like it had previously been used in 'Elysium'. Furthermore the Make-Up should easily walk away with an Oscar next year. However, excellent production values do not a good film make and as a movie the force is just not with it."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Colorful flick with cartoony characters and action -- I'll bet it was more fun in the theater, especially if you could bring a couple of 11-year-old boys.

Either way, if you have any experience in watching movies, you will always be able to predict what is going to happen next. Although one of the main aspects of the film is the fate of the entire galaxy, there is never really anything at stake. The climax is cheap and predictable\r On the other hand, \"Guardians of Galaxy\" can be surprisingly fun at times. All actors are good too, even though the characters are all black and white - this is a classic good vs. evil fairytale after all. Visual effects are outstanding as well and if You are going to watch it, watch it in 3D, because 3D always covers some of the film's weaker aspects and failures.\r All in all, \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" is not a terrible movie, but I would not be as psyched about it as the rest 95% of Internet is.

But as a film, i'ts a bit repetitive and doesn't arc very well start to finish.  all the stuff that makes it feel like a \"movie\" seems shoehorned in, which is why you have a 3rd act which races up on you once you get there, and all of a sudden you're thrust into an epic battle that you don't really care about.  \"Guardians\" values jokes over drama, and it's not funny enough to get away with it."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Don't go in believing the hype. Worth a matinee pricetag but not the blockbuster hollywood so desperately wants us to believe it is and clearly needs this summer (the worst hollywood summer season in years.)\r The heroes of the movie consist of a talking raccoon, a green woman assassin, a muscle bound mercenary, a talking tree and a funny human front man. The movie seemed to be confused on whether they wanted to make a a superhero film for the kids, a serious film targeting adults, or a rom-com teenager film. It felt like the movie never settled in to a theme and about a dozen times I found myself thinking \"that was out of place.\"\r For example, the main hero, played by Chris Pratt, starts off the journey on an abandoned planet where he turns on his 80's walkman, dancing and using the native lizard creatures for microphones to find an orb to make some coin from a collector. Its very fun, light and seems like a great movie that even the kids can come to. It then bounces towards the middle of the movie where the drunken raccoon \"rocket\" breaks down over his history, saying he didn't want to be created and at one point even tells his co-hero that he doesn't care that he lost his wife and daughter, in a move that probably sounded better written than they pulled off on film. Then add in and awkwardly long flip off scene from the main hero to the camera, an awkward blacklight \"sperm joke, and finishing the movie with a \"We're the guardians of the galaxy, **** punchline.\r I did find myself however enjoying the special effects and was surprisingly impressed by the acting from a tree, raccoon and former WWE wrestler.\r Worth seeing once, but it could definitely have done without all the hype."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "WOW, just wow.

Nothing against marvels other superhero movies, this just had that little extra that made it awesome.

You follow a group of misfits turned unlikely heroes with the goal of saving the galaxy from a **** crazy antagonist with plans of destroying said universe.

The film's visual effects really help to bring the various extra-terrestrial settings to life. The pop compilation soundtrack is an additional fun factor to the film's light-hearted humour.\r However, these features seem to make up for and mask \"Guardians\"' lacking plot in which a forgettable villain seeks to destroy the universe while the protagonists take measures to stop them, something not too dissimilar to other Marvel movie story lines (\"Thor: The Dark World\" in particular). This clich\u00e9 plot needs to be given a rest, especially when the film doesn't seem to really accentuate that particular threat and its implications.\r Other than colourful alien worlds, there is nothing else that this film seems to offer or present other than its entertaining cast and humour. I really would have liked for a better insight into Peter Quill and his experiences, having been taken away so suddenly from Earth, and a better look at the various worlds we are presented with in the film. Star Wars is a great example of showcasing distinct planets that we become accustomed too and can easily recognise; \"Guardians\" needs to take a page or two from that book.\r I have a feeling that the direction in which this film could have been taken in was shunted due to the fact that Marvel wanted to introduce key plot points that would feature and play heavily in the overall arc of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and its Phases, especially with the expanded introduction of Thanos, whom we can speculate will be the ultimate villain in an \"Avengers\" movie. Though I understand that this film had the appropriate setting and theme in which to officially introduce these plot points, it feels like it drags it down from feeling like its own, separate entity and not just something that has to very specifically tie into Marvel's current plans for their movies.\r \"Guardians of The Galaxy\" is a particularly entertaining film with the crux of its popularity seemingly accumulated from the wild response to the vivid and discrete ensemble of characters and the film's lively and amusing tone. The clich\u00e9 plot and forgettable villain disappointingly drags \"Guardians\" down. Don't be fooled by the critics' consensus; this film is good but its notable errors prove that there is definitely room for improvement. Origin stories often tend to fall into this trap but leeway is obviously permitted as the filmmakers get to find their footing and subsequently and hopefully deliver a more developed story and villain for the sequel.\r Is \"Guardians\" worth the watch?

They really got the family dynamic and making all of the guardians lovable. They fight, they argue, they try to work together and you really get a sense of a family here. The marvel universe felt even bigger now with this film introducing new races, planets, technology and even giving Thanos more screen time. The worlds and creature you see feel like they good exist and are very inventive and entertaining. The humor is perfect. It has just enough and is timed perfectly and always feels natural. The action is straight up awesome. Every action sequence is shot so well and the action flows perfectly. The effects are colorful and gorgeous. The plot is great but the villain was pretty meh and didn't have much going for him witch is practically my only flaw. Definite recommend if you haven't seen this already."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "Never ever felt a movie three times as long as it really was. My husband and I, we were relieved and glad when the credits started rolling. The special effects were incredible but the two-dimensional heroes, the lame jokes and the flimsy story ruined the fun for us.\r The first few minutes were good but, after the abduction, everything went faster downhill than Rocket Raccoon could talk. We were so bored out of our minds, even the bombastic visuals and the showdown couldn't lift our spirits in the end.\r I'm really baffled about so many people describing the dialogues as \"clever\" or \"witty\". I found them to be incredibly stupid, not funny and just lame. I never watched a movie before where the heroes a) loved hearing themselves talk, b) where they talked non-stop and c) had absolutely nothing to say.\r The CGI-effects made this an A movie, the rest is barely C-material."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "One of the most boring movies i have ever seen. I cannot understand how people like this garbage that much. It is not worth watching. What a waste of two hours in my entire life."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "The latest Marvel mashup brings a ragtag gang of unusual characters together to save the universe. Led by a sweet, swaggering human (Chris Pratt), the group includes a tree creature, a green woman, a literal hulk and an armed raccoon. This opens things up for irreverent humor, which isn't always that funny. Action is inevitable, but most of it's fast & noisy without standing out. There's also lots to look at, including dozens of fun creatures and some cool design. The playful tone and unusual individuals make it entertaining, but the underlying lack of originality keeps it from soaring."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "There are very few movies that perfectly blends comedy, action, and wonder. As you watch the movie, you can be connected with the characters as they develop before your eyes. Each character, important or less,  is developed with care and with the right pacing. The comedy is well timed and easily understandable for most people. The universe is vast, but never overwhelming, allowing deep immersion. The tools, ships and beings can be connected to our world in a way that is both believable and imaginative. Most of all, the sound track is on cue, setting mode perfectly to the scene it is partnered with. This movie is a prime example of a good summer blockbuster."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Guardians of the Galaxy, predictably, turns out to be just another good (but not outstanding) quality blockbuster movie, with lots of passable action, absolutely flat plot and moderately funny jokes (this time around there's more focus on the jokes). I should also note that this movie has a great soundtrack comprised of many 70s hit songs.\rThe thing that's very uneven in GOTG are the characters. The protagonist team is mostly good - Chris Pratt fits the role of space Indiana Jones well (although sometimes being too childish), Dave Bautista (Drax) is surprisingly funny, the Racoon is alright (although constantly angry) and Groot with its big eyes is just cute. However, the character problem starts with Gamora, who is Zoe Saldana painted green. Not only her character is cliche, but also her looks are just ridiculous and terrible. Sadly, the same applies to many other characters in this film. The crowd, consisting of many \"aliens\" is really just a lot of painted people, which looks pretty damn stupid. What is more, the main antagonist suffers from the same issue. I'm sorry, but an ugly blue **** in a rubber suit with some black **** splattered around his face just doesn't seem too menacing to me.\rAnyway, is it a good movie? Yep. Is it worth watching in a cinema? Pretty much, there's not too much competition now. But is it something outstanding, something memorable? Not really, just another quality blockbuster from Marvel, which shows despite the setting having been changed to outer space."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "I was disappointed the movie is nothing like the trailer.  A lot of things blowing up and crashing for 2 hours.  Boring movie and repetitive.  Only the NY Post reviewer gave it the low rating it deserved."}], "recommendations": ["thor_ragnarok", "thor_the_dark_world", "the_a_team", "hercules", "the_lego_movie", "avengers_age_of_ultron", "thor_love_and_thunder", "shazam_fury_of_the_gods", "poseidon", "deadpool", "bumblebee", "riddick", "serenity", "incredibles_2", "the_lego_ninjago_movie", "jack_the_giant_slayer", "megamind", "monsters_vs_aliens", "deadpool_2", "bloodshot", "hotel_transylvania_3_summer_vacation", "edge_of_tomorrow", "gods_of_egypt", "rampage", "minions"]}
