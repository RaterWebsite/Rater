      "text": "Easily one of the best films of 2018. The three leads are incredibly good, with Rachel Weisz leading the way.  I've always loved Olivia Colman, and she's fantastic as the insecure, gluttonous Queen Anne. Emma Stone is really good, but the movie takes a bit of a turn (along with her performance) about 2/3 of the way through.  I have to mention the director and the DP - the film is shot absolutely beautifully, and the score is innovative / perfectly pitched. A word of caution: if you're easily offended, you might want to steer clear. It's not a movie of its time. But it is uproariously funny at times - great writing."

I don\u2019t think the film knows what it wants to be: it\u2019s not that funny, it\u2019s not about character development, and there\u2019s no real story beyond a rivalry between the two main characters to become the favourite of the queen.  There\u2019s very little evidence to support the story, so it doesn\u2019t really qualify as historical fiction.The music soundtrack is ugly and distracting (is this a comment on the queen?  Who knows?  Who cares?)Ultimately I was relieved it was over.  Overrated, over complicated, But thankfully, over."

One can but applaud him for being able to entice finance from the supposed \"hard-nosed\" money men of Tinseltown and make films that are only comprehensible to a very select few. How to approach his latest, \"The Favourite\"? Some compare it to Kubrick's \"Barry Lyndon\", when in reality there are more than a few nods to the outlandish Ken Russell. Is it a drama? Is it a comedy? Is it a comedy drama or a drama comedy? Who can tell? Hopefully the locations and the costume providers have got Yorgos on their Christmas card list. As for the actresses whose talents have been largely wasted,let's hope their careers can survive their participation here. There were moments when all three were on screen at the same time and the power struggles all three endured would have made a more memorable film. Unfortunately the music of the film's composer would then raise its ugly head or the \"fish -eye\" lens of the cameraman would interfere and kill any drama stone-dead.Hopefully \"word-of-mouth\" will kill this film off and at some point there will be a reality check amongst the critics who will finally realise that Yorgos has subjected them to an \"Emperor's New Clothes\" scenario yet again and they have been had not once, not twice but three times now."

It has been called 'wickedly entertaining', 'hilarious', 'black comedy at its best', 'delectable wit', 'a riff on \"All About Eve\" and a metacritic.com 91% rating of critics and a 8.5 out of 10 rating while the critic's rating on Rotten Tomatoes is 94% and 66% audience rating.Even though I had not liked director Yorgos Lanthimos's \"The Lobster\" between word of mouth regarding the performances of the 3 lead actresses and the talk of awards I was looking forward to 2 hours of fun, laughter and sarcastic wit. After an hour I was ready to walk out but I stayed and kept hoping something would happen for me to change my mind about this film.Neither a duck race, a naked, fat man being pelted with pomegranates by other men in long curly wigs or a wife thinking/planning a way of getting rid of a rival's power over the queen while she masturbates her husband changed my mind.Yes the acting by Olivia Colman, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz is first rate, especially by Coleman, and the power struggles between Lady Sarah (Weisz) and her cousin Abigail (Stone) including seducing the Queen (Coleman), mentally and physically, plus playing the men, in many ways, is typical of the genre while the war games between the heads of State of the French and English is really ho-hum.\"The Favorurite\" took 2 hours of my life and didn't give me 1 laugh but it did give long, dark walks along castle hallways and backways with panoramic scenes of ballrooms, bedrooms and meeting rooms. It also gave me a very annoying soundtrack of what seemed, in 50% of the film, was a beat and what sounded like a bell.In no way can I recommend this film!"

      "text": "Lost in a limbo somewhere between Masterpiece Theater and Monty Python, this artsy-fartsy cutesy-pootsy \"period drama\" is neither convincingly \"period\", nor very dramatic, nor does the occasional half-hearted comic scene redeem it.  A lot of work obviously went into this, and we have to respect the efforts of all involved but... it all turns out to be an odd and rather dreary affair that's more depressing than entertaining.While there are many lingering close-ups of Emma Stone to show that her agent has negotiated a generous portion of exclusive screen time for her, the cinematography in general is notably annoying and distracting.  In particular the \"fisheye\" wide angle shots with peripheral curving and distortion of the images, help to destroy any immersive experience here, and distance us from the story.  A story which is often a bit hard to follow, and hard to swallow.  That most of the cast don't make any attempt at English accents, and talk essentially L.A. street talk, additionally sabotages the historical ambience we expect.  Maybe this was supposed to be campy, like it was in \"Marie Antoinette\", but it doesn't come across that way here.Finally, the irritating score compounds the strange off-key quality of the film.  While some period music is used, it's performed and mixed in a way that sounds inauthentic.  Then we have long, long periods where the score is some kind of inexplicable, monotonous, modernistic knocking, tocking noise that again distracts us from the action at hand and reminds us that this is an artsy-fartsy director getting in his artsy farts instead of entertaining us.On the positive side, the bunnies are cute; ducks are always a plus in any film; and when the horsies prance along with their feathered crests on, that's pretty darn cool."

The cinematography was not a style that I appreciate, but it was competent. So was the editing. The sound mix was bad, in that the underscore was always hotter than the dialogue,and the choreography is so modern, it rips your attention right out of the period setting. But the worst offence is the underscore. It doesnt match the action and pacing at all. If they were shooting for weird and distracting, they succeeded admirably. If on the other hand they wanted all the separate parts to come together to support and add to the story then this movie is a miserable failure! In spite of that fact, some of its individual elements(acting, script, costumes) are Oscar worthy. All in all, a HUGE disappointment."

      "text": "Sometimes you have to wonder what the critics are looking for in an Oscar-worthy movie, and how they manage to find it in a film like The Favourite. This what-if-Queen-Anne\u2019s-court-was-lesbian premise is historically off the wall, given that two of the protagonists, Sarah Churchill (Rachel Weisz) and Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) were historically documented to be extremely devoted to their husbands. The historical basis for the lesbian theme apparently harks back to some vindictive rumors that were circulated during Queen Anne\u2019s reign (1702\u20131707 as Queen of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and then until 1714 as Queen of Great Britain and Ireland) by malicious and jealous courtiers. At Versailles such a scenario might have been plausible, but the stodgy, uptight English court of the eighteenth century? The French Catholic aristocracy felt they needed a priest only twice in their lives\u2014when they married and when they died\u2014but the English took the Anglican Church and the wages of sin very seriously. Since Henry VIII, the ruling monarch has been the head of the Church of England, and this kind of liberated behavior would have been severely repressed during this era.So the film has to be accepted as a fantasy, and a wild, absurdist one at that. Billed as a comedy-drama, it\u2019s not that humorous. I didn\u2019t laugh once. The actors are consummate professionals, and the costumes and period sets are perfect; nevertheless, the film is wearisome. Dark hallways looming up at the camera and a preoccupation with a wide-angle lens distortion known as pincushioning (usually considered a photographic flaw but used in this film as a feature) are recurring stylistic devices. Colman\u2019s acting in the role of Queen Anne is of the highest caliber, but she always has to act sick, moody, and on the verge of hysterics, so her character is also wearisome. Her Queen Anne seems to be quite stupid and unable to comprehend politics, economics, military strategy or anything that does not cater to her sexual needs and her personal vanity. Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone are rivals for the Queen\u2019s affections, and their characters display the worst kind of female wiles and weaknesses, stopping just short of hair-pulling and scratching each other\u2019s eyes out. Scenes are introduced with text graphics that are random quotations, sometimes skewing the letters with arbitrary spacing. The film is artistically conceited. In the end, it does not produce the desired effect, which presumably is to depict the absurdist and existentialist view that there is no intrinsic meaning in life. The musical score is as pretentious as the rest of it, vacillating between Baroque violins and a bizarre chiming sound that is supposed to set a mood but is instead unnerving and bewildering."

My vote for the best of the leads is Rachel Weisz, but she also probably had the most difficult role. Olivia Colman was wonderful as the emotionally needy Queen Anne, as was Emma Stone, her rival to be the queen\u2019s \u201cfavorite.\u201d I happened to go to the film with an eighteenth-century British historian, and I was assured Lanthimos also got his history and 18th century culture right!

The film's accurate depiction of power-hungry people and their tactics was difficult to swallow despite the humor, but it ended up proving to be a wealth of information for me in regards to the nature human treachery. It was beautiful to see how the film's ending ensued--with Emma Stone's character stuck in the degrading task of rubbing the Queen's legs in knelt position--as it demonstrated to me the futility of pursuing power, and how power could entrance even powerful people into feeling perpetually worthless and weak (like a rabbit) in relation to others. Disregarding the subject of power, I also admired the film's ending for its inevitability and natural conclusion. The psychological punishment that resulted from an obsession of power was that one in turn would always feel powerless, no matter what transient, self-therapeutic means one could instantiate against this feeling, including cruelty towards others, self-indulgence, or the attainment of higher social status. Emma Stone did a wonderful job portraying this character, whose troubled background, although tragic and in part responsible for her feelings of worthlessness, was not the primary determinant of her corruption. This film showed that the personal choices of the protagonist, including treating love as a means to an end rather than an end in itself, changing her allegiance in the name of personal \"safety,\" and involving herself in the framing of both political propositions and people, ruined her grace and integrity. Overall, this film was insightful in many ways, and I'd love to see this being nominated for the awards it deserves."

To say The Favourite will be like anything you\u2019ve ever seen, is a direct and misleading understatement, much like the characters it presents.Written by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara, The Favourite marks the first film Lathimos has not written a script he has directed since making his big splash at Cannes in 2009 with his highly unconventional and controversial film Dogtooth. Yet, as much as we appreciate the auteur\u2019s uncanny ability of making people feel uncomfortable using the eeriness and awkwardness of other people by simply interacting with one another, this is one script that feels more Lathimos than any of the ones he has written in the past.While the film is made during a prominent and very loud #MeToo movement in Hollywood, The Favourite is set in 18th Century England, a land where Queens rule and Kings drool, especially when the Queen is Mrs. Morley Anne (Olivia Colman) ruler of Scotland, Ireland and England and currently waging war against France. While the Queen is surrounded by men, including her military commanders and parliamentary leaders, Queen Anne proves that at the end of the day, the women make the rules and own the house. Yet, as important and iconic Queen Anne is, it becomes clear quickly that Anne is no more of a mere mortal with a crown next to her life-long friend and council advisor, The Duchess of Marlborough, Sarah Churchill (Rachael Weisz). While Sarah is able to wholly intimidate, scoff and insult the Queen right to her face, it seem that Sarah is only looking out for one person and one person only, despite her illusions and deceit. Occasionally giving accord to Queen Anne or her husband for that matter, military commander of the Queen\u2019s army, Lord Marlborough (Mark Gatniss), Sarah is one a one-way ticket to riches, power and most importantly her, affection.As Sarah seems to seemingly pave a path of success for years to come, things come to a steady halt with the arrival of her cousin, Abigail (Emma Stone). Although Abagail arrives in a heap of mud, discontent and stalked by tragedy, she quickly hardens up and wilts to the whim of her commanding cousin, only to quickly gain her affection and take her opportunity for the Queen\u2019s admiration, following a natural herbal remedy for the Queen\u2019s disgusting gout infested legs. Once Abigail becomes the Queen\u2019s own personal leg-rubber, she begins plotting her dominance over the Queen and her affections, overshadowing her own cousin, proving that Sarah\u2019s proteg\u00e9 as quickly become her biggest and most intimidating rival.Where Sarah adorns the Queen with her brazen honesty and harsh truths, including advising when the queen looks like a badger, Abigail\u2019s approach to the affections of the Queen include lies, deceit and endless compliments, making the Queen feel unlike anything Sarah never has. Often times eroticizing the Queen and her mundane and bizarre daily routines with her bunnies and while eating, Abigail and Sarah begin to duel for Anne\u2019s love, doing whatever it takes to be her favourite.As it turns out, each woman is capable of much unpleasantness, not only to one another, themselves but also to the poor saps surrounding them. Manipulating every man, woman and child around them for their own personal gains; both in search of security, status and nobility, Abigail and Sarah turn the conventions of a chessboard on its head, and make the queens, rooks, bishops and knights all of their pawns in their sick and twisted little kinky game of pleasure.Attacking one another like vipers and wolves, jealousy becomes the weapon of choice for both women, who\u2019s use of men only intensifies their sadistic little game of mitral destruction and decay. Taking no prisoners, Abigail and Sarah create alliances, forms admirable teams with many of the men occupying the palace on a daily basis."

      "text": "With Olivia Colman set to follow on from Claire Foy as Queen Elizabeth in the third season of The Crown, it seems a satisfying coincidence that Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019 latest film The Favourite sees the actress take on the role of another monarch. The Crown may be the dictionary definition of period drama, but The Favourite is a very different affair, a tantalising twist on what often promises to be a dull sub-genre.Here, Colman stars as Anne, the last Stuart queen \u201cstalked by tragedy\u201d, ravaged by gout and depression, with her pet rabbits her only solace. She has passed on the keys of power to her closest confidant and secret lover, Lady Sarah Churchill (Rachel Weisz), but all is turned on its head with the arrival of Abigail Hill (Emma Stone) a once noblewoman whose family has fallen on hard times. As Abigail surprisingly gains the favour of the Queen, so begins a ruthless battle that plays out before our eyes in a particularly captivating power struggle between the three women.The Favourite is an enthralling film; Lady Sarah and Abigail turn loyalty into an increasingly vicious blood sport, making for a narrative littered with gratifying double-crossing, carnal intensity and stylish brutality, all accompanied by an almost illusionary sense of madness. It can only be defined as a tragicomedy, subtly hilarious yet hiding timely subtext that is delightfully ambiguous. The lines between love and deception are expertly blurred in a film that takes no prisoners in its uproarious execution. There is more deliberation in the overblown final act, however, that feels lengthy and distinctly less focused than the rest of the film.The movie finds its greatest strength in its stellar cast, led by Colman, Stone and Weisz. Colman is outstanding as Anne, hilariously petulant and childlike, reminiscent of Miranda Richardson\u2019s Queenie in Blackadder. There\u2019s a blunt imperiousness to Colman\u2019s performance that carries the film through with black humour. Beyond this, however, the scenes of greatest emotional resonance are those that show the more tragic side of Anne, as a woman who has lost seventeen children (\u201cSome were born in blood, some without breath and some were with me a very brief time\u201d) and has never recovered from the trauma. Colman breezes through these harsher scenes that cut surprisingly deep and help to give the film a greater purpose.Rachel Weisz is the epitome of calculated steeliness as Lady Sarah and Emma Stone is pitch perfect in her first period role as the opportunistic and marvellously Machiavellian Abigail. Nicholas Hoult\u2019s flamboyant Leader of the Opposition leads several foppish male roles, but these lie clearly in the peripheral; Yorgos Lanthimos makes apparent that the film\u2019s sole focus is its women, all of whom are callous, yet vulnerable, but all quite brilliant in different ways.The Favourite is beautifully designed, lavish costumes by Sandy Powell and a regal set giving the film all the expected grandeur of a period drama. The film\u2019s more salacious side, however, is shown in Robbie Ryan\u2019s absurdist cinematography which, whilst occasionally pretentious, gives a haunting contemporary spin. I was less of a fan of the wide-angled bend shots, as well as the film\u2019s soundtrack (from Handel to the itchy modernism of Anna Meredith), which felt invasive and ceaseless.Here, Yorgos Lanthimos has struck a fine chord. The Favourite is a wonderfully unusual and unsettling film that is at points gratuitous, but generally audacious and exciting. Spellbinding performances and an intriguing story make this not one to miss out on."

      "text": "A wickedly dark, smug period piece comedy that's sure to leave viewers routinely agasp at its outrageous humor, which marvelously mixes understatement with in-your-face bawdiness. The trio of protagonists brilliantly portrayed by Olivia Colman, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz never disappoint, with each at the top of their game. The film's smartly written script is crisp and snappy throughout, even if it takes liberties with history and occasionally falls back on director Yorgos Lanthimos's signature penchant for needless ambiguity. Not everyone will go for this one, but if you can imagine a mix of the catiest moments from \"Dynasty\" dressed up in 18th Century trappings, you've got an idea what \"The Favourite\" is all about."

      "text": "No other period pieces come to mind when trying to find a comparison for 'The Favourite,' and even if there were, none would hold a candle to this 18th century tale of social scheming and palace politics.Director Yorgos Lanthimos previously caught the attention (and admiration) of art house audiences with 2015's 'The Lobster,' followed by last year's 'The Killing of a Sacred Deer.'  However this film is different, and it will justifiably earn Lanthimos a spot at the table reserved for Hollywood's elite directors.The cast is outright brilliant.  Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz, Emma Stone, and Nicholas Hoult each deserve their own paragraph  of praise.  However, it is Colman who ultimately takes the cake for her performance (pun intended!).  She looks to be the early front-runner for the Academy Award for Best Actress--a statement that is further bolstered by the fact that she just won that award category at the BAFTAs.Expect her official nomination come January ... along with a slew of other nominations covering just about every Oscar category."

With the bells, the music etc. constantly in the backround, very difficult fully understanding what was being said. The director seems to want to impress. All in all, an artsy fartsy film.  In any case, didn't think it was funny."

In short, 2+ hours of torture. No one laughed. No one reacted.  I see a lot of movies - this was in my bottom 10, for what\u2019s its worth.  Guys, if your girlfriend wants to go see it, please suggest something else to do. She\u2019ll love you for it."

      "text": "Provocative director Yorgos Lanthimos brings us what many are saying is his most mainstream work yet -- \"The Favourite.\" Make no mistake though, this movie is twisted, philosophically intriguing and, yes, provocative. This is a deep, dangerous study of the problems with power and the relationships that revolve around powerful figures. It's masterfully directed and acted, featuring a brilliant screenplay with carefully constructed characters and what's easily the best central conceit in any movie I've seen this year. It may not be for everyone, but it's certainly worth a watch."

It\u2019s both your typical awards fare and everything against the Oscar tropes: it\u2019s an early 18th century setting about a crabby old queen (okay, fine\u2026 she\u2019s not that old, she\u2019s like, 42) who suffers from gout, and features an actress in the lead who won a little golden naked man for playing a struggling actress. But you know what else this motion picture contains? A duck race, badger-style makeup, mud baths, fish-eye lenses, walls buried under tapestries, smoke rings, oranges thrown at a naked man in a pink wig, Emma Stone\u2019s boobs, and lots of pet rabbits. Believe it or not, it\u2019s bound to be The Favourite of the Academy.It\u2019s miraculous to see how director Yorgos Lanthimos drags us down his rabbit hole to intoxicate us with his mad tea party where the hopping madness of the queen\u2019s new servant (Stone) initiates an inconceivable battle of wits between herself and her cousin (Weisz). Every single frame looks like one of the numerous works of anti-art hung up in the queen\u2019s castle, with doses of natural light used to illuminate the large interiors that tighten in on you through their arches. When there\u2019s no sun available, candle lights are relied upon to darken the tone, making the women\u2019s angst feel greater. Then when the perspective of the storytelling shifts into this new servant girl\u2019s point of view, the proper look of the screen suddenly turns bulbous as if looking through the eyes of a guppy. You really do feel like you\u2019ve gone mad in Lanthimos\u2019 not-so-wonderous land of hearts.What\u2019s so grand about these three women fighting for power is that it all takes place in a single location, the only real change being the leisure outdoor bird-shooting. The bounding to the castle that almost feels like a character itself is a creative choice not implemented enough with other period pieces that instead decide to let the lavish sets and costumes take the narrative wheel. While these are still the best sets and costumes 2018 has had to offer, they never become the focus for a second. It\u2019s all just a matter of escalating the three-way tension.Speaking of three-ways, I should forewarn you that there is plenty of lesbianism that these women share with one another. That is, the two servants fight for the affections of the queen, a fight that even turns near-fatal at one circumstance or another. Although, it\u2019s worth noting by fact checkers that it was never 100% confirmed that Queen Anne was ever a lesbian, and implementing it as a core part of this story probably was not fair to do, especially while leaving out her real-life husband from the story who died before the events told here. Yet for what this film strove to do, it gladly did not fall into the trap of turning the lovemaking full-on steamy, just enough of it is shown to give the idea without detracting from what each character feels.Now, how should you feel as you watch The Favourite? Most likely, you\u2019ll be rolling on the floor in laughter. I certainly was, maybe not literally, but next to Paddington 2, no other movie of 2018 made me laugh harder than this one. The eruptive line deliveries that the three women explode out of their vocal cords got the audience of my screening roaring with laughter as much as any other family comedy; what got me laughing the hardest was a wondrously bizarre dance that looked much like two courting geese. Oh, and the duck race at the beginning: that \u201cquacked\u201d me up quite a bit!Such a flavor for humor displays the film\u2019s ironic mindset of mocking the mad British monarchy, for even now, just like hundreds of years ago, women wanting to strangle one another for power always gets out of hand. That doesn\u2019t at all mean this movie is anti-men, anti-women, or anything even remote to that. It instead testifies to all women with given authority over men how they must honor their authority while also honoring one another. It\u2019s not a manner of which one with the most prominent \u201cV\u201d should be at the top of the pyramid, it\u2019s a manner of us all being together, aligned toward the same goal.Just to be plain, this movie is not for everyone. In fact, I say its totally bizarre narrative and tone makes it one of those movies only made to appeal to a select few who can appreciate its narrative approach. Odds are, a woman getting brutally scarred by a horse is not your idea of funny and watching two women feeling up one another is not the best way for you to see the dangers of women abusing their authority. That\u2019s why extreme caution is advised, but that\u2019s the way it should be. Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019 newest masterwork is indeed a complicated movie about complicated topics and is not something anyone should think of taking lightly. Now, who wants some blue waffles?"

But again, I know I\u2019m in the minority here."
