      "text": "Man tends to do crazy stuffs for a woman, but stealing $17m is too crazy.The film reminded me 'Pain & Gain', only for inspiring from the real and being the comedy flicks. Other than that there's nothing in common between them. I have been expecting a lot from Zack since 'The Hangover', but it was always the near missed opportunities. I'm not saying this was his much needed breakthrough, but quite enjoyable film.An honest man who worked long enough as a guard for a bank, was approached by his ex colleague and her men with an offer. Since he was madly in love with her, he could not say no to it, despite he already got engaged to another woman. As planned the heist goes on and once it was done, he was ditched and ratted out. Now on the run, how he responds to it and the following events decides his fate.Not a great comedy nor a heist film, but it had its moments. The casting was good and it was Zack's show. The rest of them were not into that much, except in the final act. Jason Sudeikis was a bonus. His appearance added more fun. Now I know why Jim Carrey opted out. Owen Wilson's part was not good enough in such a small role, he did good though. Watching it for timepass is fine or even for beyond that seems not a bad try.7/10"

Great cast, and Kristen Wiig and Zach Galifianakis are especially funny, but I also got a big kick out of Jason Sudeikis and Owen Wilson. It's based on a true story, so stick around during the credits to see photos of the real people that the movie was based on."

Plus the comedic stuff isn't too over the top or too dumb. Of course it is still dumb, but it is a comedy, what do you expect? All comedies work with dumb jokes. If you don't like dumb jokes, then you need to watch different type of comedies and should have known that Galifianakis and most of the other actors there have maybe 1 or 2 comedies like that or even none?"

They served delicious gyros with just a little too much sauce. The onions were very good but your breath stunk afterward. And after a week or so you get sick of eating the same thing. Would it kill you to offer us some mozzarella sticks, God?I talked with God and he said he was hoping that the Phoenix Coyotes would win the Stanley Cup this year and I had to tell him that they're called the \"Arizona Coyotes\" now. He seemed surprised and said, \"that's a much worse name.\" I agreed and said I would see him tomorrow. He asked if he could come with me and I said it wasn't a good idea because I was very tired.Through God anything is possible, so I'm giving this a 10."

He's a guard for an armored car company who's talked into stealing millions by the equally dense woman he has a crush on (Kristen Wiig, who underplays her role with less successful results). The ironic title means that stupidity is glorified into a clueless cast of characters. Some of the gags land a laff, but others just try too hard. The supporting roles add to the fun, especially Kate McKinnon & Leslie Jones.  The lively energy keeps it moving and the quirky attempts at humor sometime succeed. NOTE: See the real people on which the movie is based during the credits."

If you like stupid dumb comedies like the Hangover series, Wedding Crashers, Due Date, and of course Dinner for Schmucks then you will love this one.  Zach Galifanakis is a riot and pulls off this comedy with the support of others, but most of the humor he does single handed, although hats off to Jason Sudeikis who gives him comedic support as the not so brilliant hired killer Mike McKinney.  There is a laugh a minute in this movie and for me it never dulls, as literally my sides hurt as I did lots of laughing out loud.  Perhaps some don't like this type of humor, but for me I love it.  I will be buying this one when it comes out on dvd so I can relive the scenes and humor and one liners.  I wasn't the only one in the theater lol as I heard everyone else laughing it up too.  Give it a chance I don't think you will be disappointed at all, for me it will be one I relish over and over."

I love a good slapstick, juvenile comedy especially when it's in the nuanced hands of actors like Galifinakis and Wiig. Hess has made me laugh hard before, and after a few turkeys, I wondered if he could repeat the trick. All I can say is I had a great time watching this one, and I laughed out loud a lot. Good comedies are a rare breed, and Masterminds is among my faves."
