      "text": "This was a truly pathetic attempt to remake an incredible movie. See the original 2008 film directed by Pascal Laugier, not this lame Hollywood remake. Just as when a great painting is created by an artist, you come off as a fool to copy it, so it is the case when a film is made so perfectly, so spot on, you become a buffoon in trying to duplicate the original masterpiece."

This was terrible. It's the appitomy of a watered down American remake, the ending is just, well, if you've seen it you know. The original Martyrs had such a graphic, shocking ending it stuck with you for weeks. This, not so much.I won't slate the acting like alot of people, they were all fine I guess, but one thing that truelly annoyed me was the terrible shotgun sound effect. When there's the first gunshot out of the blue near the beginning that should be a jumpy crap your pants moment, but the shotgun sounds so ridiculously pathetic it's laughable.Please, I emplore all of you, just watch the original."
