Lester is not liked by his wife or daughter and is about to be sacked from his job. As a result he decides to live his life exactly how he wants, to the further frustration of his family.\r The film deservedly won five Academy Awards including best picture, best director and best actor. Writer Alan Ball delivers a clever and darkly humorous script much in the vein of the excellent Six Feet Under and the cast are uniformly brilliant, particularly Kevin Spacey in the lead role. American Beauty provides a fascinating insight into what might be going on behind the closed doors of seemingly normal suburban households and is certainly a movie worth seeing."

People liked talking about it and recommending it to those who haven't seen it. I'm sure for the fact I've seen it and you know what? I love it to death. It's one of those movies that you have to watch before you die. It is one of my favourite films of all time. Kevin Spacey has done it again with his excellent performance like in The Usual Suspects. he won an Oscar for his performance as Lester Burnham and now he's a two time Oscar winner. Everyone else did a fantastic job acting in this film including Annette Bening. The story in this is great and flawless about Kevin Spacey as Lester Burnham narrating about his life. He has a wife, Carolyn Burnham played by Annette Bening who is an ambitious woman and a daughter, Jane played by Thora Birch who f**king despises her family. Wes Bentley as Ricky Fitts who is obsessively filming everything around his surroundings with his camcorder and he is curious about Lester's daughter, Jane next door. Lester hates his job, has a midlife crisis and becomes possessed with his daughter's best friend, Angela Hayes played by Mena Suvari. He starts having sexual fantasies about her, in which red rose petals are a recurring motif. As much as I love everything about American Beauty, this is something that I watch almost every night. It has that amazing impeccable cinematography that just makes the way the film looks satisfying like the red petals that Mena Suvari is laying on. That is the moment of beauty. \"Spec-tacular!\" The directing is really good. It's made by Sam Mendes who I assume who directs two James Bond movies like Skyfall and Spectre starring Daniel Craig. I was shocked by the fact that this was actually his first film which is quite a coincidance! I really, really love this film. It shows the characters how they're feeling and communicate with one another. Whenever you're think of American Beauty, you would be like, \"Wow! That is the most beautiful film I've seen!\" and it is a beautiful film with surprisingly dark humour, the acting is perfection, the story is well written, the cinematography is impeccably shot and it's definitely worth your five Oscars if you haven't seen it. This is one of Sam Mendes' incredible Oscar winning masterpieces! You have no idea what you're missing, I'm sure. But don't worry... you won't someday."

      "text": "American Beauty:A beautiful masterpiece that Hollywood is usually fearful of producing to the world.Starring: Kevin Spacey. Annette Bening. Thora Birch.Directed by Sam Mendes.By Blake Patterson.100/100.   \u201cTrue realism consists in revealing the surprising things which habit keeps covered and prevents us from seeing,\u201d said Jean Cocteau, a French writer. American Beauty, released in 1999, is a motion picture that can fool the public, if they just read the title. They would probably think that it is an idealistic movie about the beauty of America. Just to let the readers know, American Beauty is the complete opposite of romanticism. This film is a piece of realism that doesn't play safe. American Beauty is one of those rare all-time classics that radiates with an original plot, a first-rate cast, wicked provocation, and a fantastic crew; this critique will also include a personal experience.   As a consequence of pushing the envelope, American Beauty is a film doesn't play safe for its viewers. Alan Ball, the screenwriter of American Beauty, writes this film with such savage wit that it is so irresistible to watch. American Beauty is a morbid look into the lives of two dysfunctional families who are neighbors. People like to say that this film is about a sexually frustrated father who is obsessed with his daughter's sleazy friend. That is a subplot in this film, but that is not its focus. Professors are probably teaching this film to future screenwriters or anyone in the study of film. That's one of the reasons why American Beauty has such a fresh screenplay.   By the same token, American Beauty has an exceptional ensemble. Kevin Spacey portrays as the most blunt character, Lester Burnham, in the whole film, and he defines pure perfection in the role. Annette Bening is outstanding as Carolyn Burnham, Lester's wife. The young cast members, who are played by Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, and Mena Suvari, deliver awesome performances in the film. Viewers will witness other superb performances from Chris Cooper, Allison Janney, Peter Gallagher, etc. A masterpiece always includes a marvelous cast.   In addition to the following, American Beauty is one of the most provocative films ever made. One of the best parts of this film is how it conveys these characters with optimism, like I Love Lucy and other sitcoms, from the introduction. As the story furthers, it goes more in depth with these characters; this is a fine example of realism. People who want movies that show happiness should turn off the movie. Another reason why this film will trigger people is due to the eroticism displayed in this film; this will irritate prudish people. The other common reason why American Beauty is controversial is because of the mature themes it contains; the public will have to look closer, watch American Beauty, to discover what the subjects are. These are the common reasons why American Beauty causes attention.   In the meantime, I would like to discuss a personal experience that revolves around this film. Last year in Theater Arts 1, I chose to perform the introductory monologue from this film; by the way, the monologues in this film are well-written. I told my teacher about my choice for the project, and he was already supporting me. If I had told the other teacher in the auditorium about it, I wouldn't have been able to act it out due to one sexual reference. That shows how people are about content in movies these days.   As a result of brilliance, American Beauty includes ravishing work from the crew members. Audiences will experience gorgeous cinematography from Conrad L. Hall. They will also hear Thomas Newman's dazzling film score. American Beauty was Sam Mendes' debut as a director, and the stakes were high because of that. Mendes is an artist, and he knows how direct with enthusiasm. Kudos to the crew members for creating this film phenomenally.   In conclusion, American Beauty is one of the greatest films ever made. The film is flat-out uproarious, and then it gives audiences a compelling punch in the face. American Beauty won five Academy Awards including: Kevin Spacey for Best Leading Actor, Alan Ball for Best Original Screenplay, Sam Mendes for Best Director, Conrad L. Hall for Best Cinematography, and Best Picture. American Beauty is not only one of the best films of the nineties, but it is also one of the best movies of the twentieth century. Like Cocteau said in his quote above, American Beauty exhibits the surprises hidden in these humane characters, and it doesn't keep their secrets covered."

      "text": "I recently just revisited this movie, and I thought I just had to share my opinion. 'American Beauty' is a comedy-drama film directed by British director Sam Mendes in his directorial debut. Since then, he won an Oscar and went on to direct 'Road to Perdition' (2002) and 'Skyfall' (2012).\r The movie focuses on a man named Lester (Kevin Spacey), who is going through an intense mid-life crisis. His materialistic wife Carolyn (Annette Benning), ignores him and treats objects like people and people like objects. His 16 year old daughter Jane (Thora Birch) is insecure and is saving up to get her breasts done, she also blames her insecurity on her parents.\r Also, Lester's job is hanging on a thread, he feels as if he is unwanted and does not want to continue to work there.\r The family also have new next door neighbors moving in, Colonel Frank Fitts (Chris Cooper) with his wife and son, Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley).\r One night, Lester reluctantly joins his wife to go see their daughter perform a cheer-leading routine at her high school. It's there that Lester sees something he truly desires, her name is Angela (Mena Suvari). Angela is a good friend of Jane's ironically, and Lester starts to imagine this young girl in many sexual scenarios. Who can blame him? He hasn't been intimate with his wife for god knows how long, and Angela's features including; blonde hair, blue eyes, and red lips are enough for Lester to lust over this young girl. Is it wrong for a man in his 40s to lust over a teenage girl who has no idea about his dirty fantasies? As long as he doesn't act upon it, then he isn't doing something illegal, but morally, it is wrong.\r Meanwhile, Ricky seems to have a sort of fascination for Lester's daughter, Jane. Her natural looks and constant belief that she isn't beautiful makes him more attracted and obsessed with her.\r Lester decides to change his life around, bossing around his wife and smoking pot and even bulking up to impress the young Angela. Angela, drugs and quitting his dead-end job are the solutions to ending his mid-life crisis.\r 'American Beauty' is a beautifully filmed picture, with gorgeous cinematography by the late Conrad L. Hall and sure-handed direction from then-first time director Sam Mendes is astonishing and it's no wonder why he won an Oscar for this.\r The second half of this movie does get a little slow-paced, and it does drag. But this movie was a very warped experience with all of the emotional disconnection, and I was still gripped. This is one of the best movies of the 1990s, along with 'Schindler's List' (1993) and 'Goodfellas' (1990)."

      "text": "Over the years, many films have taken a dark look at the supposedly perfect ideal of a white picket fence, a little house, and a nuclear family. For many, the suburban life is the American dream. For others, however, it can turn into a twisted nightmare of unfulfilled desires, repressed needs, and shattered hopes. Because of the necessity to keep up appearances, a serene facade often conceals a breeding ground for dysfunction, anxiety, and hypocrisy. Directors like David Lynch have made this their playground. Lynch in particular delights in depicting the root causes of social decay in suburbia - and he does it by autopsy. American Beauty is not as dark as a Lynch project, since it allows for small moments of redemption, but it mines the same general territory.\r If there's a rule in American cinema that all families not named Brady must be dysfunctional, then American Beauty does nothing to violate it. Most teenagers think their parents are strange, but, in the case of Jane Burnham (Thora Birch, whose largest previous big screen role was in Alaska), this is as much a state of reality as it is a state of mind. Her father, Lester (Kevin Spacey), is suffering through a mid-life crisis. At the age of 42, he has become apathetic to everything. \"Both my wife and daughter think I'm this gigantic loser,\" he confesses at one point, \"And they're right. I have lost something. I didn't always feel this sedated.\" Meanwhile, Jane's mother, Carolyn (Annette Bening), places such value on status that she has turned into a \"bloodless, money-grubbing freak\" who has no time for any form of intimacy. Her creed: \"You cannot count on anyone except yourself.\" She and Lester continue in their dead marriage for their daughter's sake and so they'll look normal to the outside world. In a moment of clarity, Lester admits, \"Our marriage is just for show - a commercial for how normal we are, when we're anything but.\"\r American Beauty is the first feature film directed by Sam Mendes, who has an extensive background in theater, but displays a sureness that many veteran filmmakers are unable to match. At times evoking elements of Todd Solondz' controversial Happiness and Ang Lee's brilliant The Ice Storm, American Beauty weds compelling drama with black comedy. The movie is character-driven, but the three protagonists are so expertly developed that we are drawn to them for the entire two hour running time. Spacey, Bening, and Birch all give the kinds of top-notch performances that deserve (but do not always get) consideration at Oscar time. Spacey's Lester may be American Beauty's narrator, but, through a low-key portrayal that conveys all the angst and confusion of a particularly bad teenage experience, Birch makes Jane the film's emotional focal point.\r If there's a weakness in American Beauty, it's in the way the story is structured. Spacey's voiceover narrative effectively kills a great deal of narrative tension when, during an opening scene, he reveals the film's ending. This approach is often forgivable if there's a compelling dramatic reason for it, but that isn't the case here. In fact, the use of the voiceover allows American Beauty to close with more exposition than is necessary. We don't need to be told, for example, that one of the film's points is that we should learn to savor every moment of life and to see all the hidden beauty the world has to offer.\r Mendes and cinematographer Conrad L. Hall add some wonderful camera work, especially when it comes to close-ups. In most films, we rarely notice this kind of shot because it is used indiscriminately. However, in American Beauty, it serves the definite purpose of offering insight into a character's mindset. There are many close-ups in this film, and few (if any) are used for the banal purpose of varying shot selection. And Thomas Newman's dynamic, playful score compliments the picture's effective visual composition.\r American Beauty doesn't trailblaze a path into hitherto untouched cinematic territory, but its presentation of vivid characters in interesting situations makes the story seem fresh. In part because it's not a complete downer and in part because it doesn't cheat the audience, American Beauty is emotionally satisfying. There's a sense of poignancy at the end, but also the feeling that we have been on an incredible trip through the lives and souls of three perfectly-realized characters. In a year that boasts few truly memorable motion pictures, Mendes can stake a claim alongside the likes of Kubrick and Egoyan as one whose cinematic vision both challenges and entertains."

      "text": "An acerbic, darkly comic critique of how social conventions can lead people into false, sterile and emotionally stunted lives, \"American Beauty\" is a real American original.\r The landscape of Ball\u2019s story is the familiar one of small-town America, and the initial take on the subject is the equally familiar one of houses with white picket fences and perfectly manicured gardens providing deceptive facades for lives wracked by hostility, tension, noncommunication and perversity. Fortunately, this view is intended not as a revelation but as a given, a starting point for a subtle and acutely judged tale in which nearly every important character metamorphoses in an utterly unpredictable way.\r Calmly observant narration by Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) informs at the outset that, in less than a year from the start of the story, he\u2019ll be dead. \u201cOf course, I don\u2019t know that yet,\u201d he quips as he and his family are trotted out. Lester is a self-described loser, having lost interest in his job at an advertising magazine as well as in any meaningful relationship with his beautiful, high-strung, real estate agent wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening), and sullen high school-age daughter, Jane (Thora Birch). Family life is a sham for all of them, and they deal with it in different ways: Lester admits it, Carolyn refuses to face it, and Jane is just waiting it out until she can fly the coop.\r Threatened with dismissal from his job, hangdog Lester finds things begin changing for him when he becomes smitten by Jane\u2019s best friend, Angela (Mena Suvari), a blond Lolita with sex on the brain. Exhilarated by the ludicrous prospect of seducing her, Lester begins obsessively pumping iron and fuels his youthful state of mind by smoking dope with a strange young man, Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley), who has just moved into the house next door with his father (Chris Cooper), a recently retired Marine Corps colonel, and shut-down mother (Allison Janney).\r Ricky frequently takes surreptitious video footage of Jane, and when she calls him on it, an unlikely but oddly convincing romantic friendship begins blossoming that finally gives Jane a release for her emotional frustration. Carolyn, for her part, seeks an outlet in the most conventional manner, lurching into a motel-room affair with the debonair \u201cking\u201d of local real estate, Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher). Evidently the only well-adjusted and relatively happy people in the neighborhood are \u201cJim and Jim\u201d (Scott Bakula and Sam Robards), a gay couple with whom Lester takes up jogging.\r One of the film\u2019s constant sources of delight and surprise is the way characters both hide and reveal their private interests, and how they are often perceived and misjudged by others. It is not giving away too much or going too far into the story\u2019s many mysteries to say that Lester can approach serenity and even a state of grace despite his initial wormlike status; that Ricky confidently pursues a secret life in spite of close surveillance from his martinet father, who forces his son to submit to regular urine tests for drug use; that Carolyn\u2019s materialist preoccupation has, in fact, become her substance, and that Jane\u2019s amorphous personality is susceptible to being shaped in just about any direction by the first strong personality she meets.\r Consistently provocative and devilishly amusing through the first hour, pic clicks into high gear midway when Lester and Carolyn finally have it out. They don\u2019t declare war, exactly, but Lester decides to let down any pretense to responsibility or normalcy in order to do his own thing as he did when he was 20, carefree and full of expectation. Blackmailing his boss for a big severance package, he hilariously takes a gig at the job at which he was always happiest, flipping burgers at a fast-food restaurant, buys his dream car and openly smokes weed whenever he wants. His new freewheeling approach to life makes him giddy, so much so that he believes he and his wife can revive their long-buried sexual relationship. But Carolyn and Jane are appalled at his breezy, tell-it-like-it-is attitude, fomenting a mood of anxious melodrama leading to the event promised by the opening narration.\r Mendes, the hottest young British theater director of recent years, on the basis of \u201cCabaret\u201d and \u201cThe Blue Room,\u201d displays a very sure hand in his first film. As precise and controlled in its effects as his legit work, \u201cAmerican Beauty\u201d is stylized in its images and humor, and Mendes has been exceedingly fortunate in working with a cinematographer as skillful as vet Conrad L. Hall, who is unsurpassed in his ability to augment the meaning of the material he films by finding its perfect visual correlative.\r Naomi Shohan\u2019s production design and Julie Weiss\u2019 costumes enhance the film\u2019s look of designed reality, while Thomas Newman\u2019s score and the many adroitly chosen song snippets often create ironic counterpoint to the exceptionally tart and entertaining proceedings."

The subtle complexity of its original and brilliant screenplay, coupled with its sensitively fabricated representation makes for an outlook-altering experience. It doesn't matter how many times I watch American Beauty, I sense a new meaning each time and am never confident that I know what the film means or what it is trying to say. Of course, the enigmatic and darkly beautiful nature of the film is helped along by subtle, honest and terrific performances from Spacey and Bening, a mesmerising score and stunning direction, but underpinning this all is a witty, dark, optimistic, pessimistic, original and overwhelming screenplay that gives this film too many dimensions to wave matching gardening clogs at."

Nonetheless, it is an amazing picture about how not to judge a book by its cover, because the inside might be nasty and problematic. Its gorgeous cinematography, excellent acting, and superb direction earn its Best Picture Oscar."

It doesn't hide it's sappy feel-good messages behind \"deep metaphors\", instead it just lets you have them, and take them in the direction you please. The acts of rebellion and production of art accompanying pure happiness throughout American Beauty make it absolutely thrilling to watch, over and over again. It really lives up to its name."

      "text": "Sam Mendes accurately expresses the complex, yet simplistic life of the typical American family. His use of subtle lighting and luring music paint the picture of normality and even the mundaneness of the middle class. Bold reds and slow-motion shots break through the cracks to show the turmoil hidden behind the fluff of those red roses.\rIt is the ultimate American contradiction of wishing to be protected and yearning to be free at the same time. This is shown through the lives of the Burnham family: Lester with all his hopes banked in the past, his daughter Jane grasping for the future, and the perfect materialized wife in Carolyn. They are each trapped by the roles society has forced upon them or that they have forced on themselves. Mendes asks, is it possible to have the comfort of safety and also maintain the thrill of freedom?\rMaybe the fault some find in \"American Beauty\" is that it does not answer any questions, but proposes many. It presents a story that is as complicated to the viewer as it is to the characters within it. It does not claim to have answers because it knows there are no clear-cut solutions in life."

      "text": "Over the years, many films have taken a dark look at the supposedly perfect ideal of a white picket fence, a little house, and a nuclear family. For many, the suburban life is the American dream. For others, however, it can turn into a twisted nightmare of unfulfilled desires, repressed needs, and shattered hopes. Because of the necessity to keep up appearances, a serene facade often conceals a breeding ground for dysfunction, anxiety, and hypocrisy. Directors like David Lynch have made this their playground. Lynch in particular delights in depicting the root causes of social decay in suburbia - and he does it by autopsy. American Beauty is not as dark as a Lynch project, since it allows for small moments of redemption, but it mines the same general territory.\r American Beauty is about the ways in which these characters grow, and the catalysts that break them out of their near-catatonic existences. It's also about the emotional paralysis that comes with age and security. We take refuge in routine, and, after a number of years, the thought of change becomes terrifying. Happiness, the goal of youth, is replaced by the desire for the artificial comfort that comes through the numbing sameness of repetition. Loveless marriages like Lester and Carolyn's exist because neither partner possesses the willingness to break the cycle. And the children they think they're protecting by staying together are often the biggest victims of their sham.\r American Beauty is the first feature film directed by Sam Mendes, who has an extensive background in theater, but displays a sureness that many veteran filmmakers are unable to match. At times evoking elements of Todd Solondz' controversial Happiness and Ang Lee's brilliant The Ice Storm, American Beauty weds compelling drama with black comedy. The movie is character-driven, but the three protagonists are so expertly developed that we are drawn to them for the entire two hour running time. Spacey, Bening, and Birch all give the kinds of top-notch performances that deserve (but do not always get) consideration at Oscar time. Spacey's Lester may be American Beauty's narrator, but, through a low-key portrayal that conveys all the angst and confusion of a particularly bad teenage experience, Birch makes Jane the film's emotional focal point.\r If there's a weakness in American Beauty, it's in the way the story is structured. Spacey's voiceover narrative effectively kills a great deal of narrative tension when, during an opening scene, he reveals the film's ending. This approach is often forgivable if there's a compelling dramatic reason for it, but that isn't the case here. In fact, the use of the voiceover allows American Beauty to close with more exposition than is necessary. We don't need to be told, for example, that one of the film's points is that we should learn to savor every moment of life and to see all the hidden beauty the world has to offer.\r endes and cinematographer Conrad L. Hall add some wonderful camera work, especially when it comes to close-ups. In most films, we rarely notice this kind of shot because it is used indiscriminately. However, in American Beauty, it serves the definite purpose of offering insight into a character's mindset. There are many close-ups in this film, and few (if any) are used for the banal purpose of varying shot selection. And Thomas Newman's dynamic, playful score compliments the picture's effective visual composition.\r American Beauty doesn't trailblaze a path into hitherto untouched cinematic territory, but its presentation of vivid characters in interesting situations makes the story seem fresh. In part because it's not a complete downer and in part because it doesn't cheat the audience, American Beauty is emotionally satisfying. There's a sense of poignancy at the end, but also the feeling that we have been on an incredible trip through the lives and souls of three perfectly-realized characters. In a year that boasts few truly memorable motion pictures, Mendes can stake a claim alongside the likes of Kubrick and Egoyan as one whose cinematic vision both challenges and entertains."

      "text": "Director Sam Mendes brings us American Beauty... Made in 1999 but what the beauty of the film is is unclear. My only guess is Kevin Spacey looking at Mena Suvari in a cheerleading outfit because nothing much else makes sense. Anyway Kevin Spacey who plays Lester Burnham has a daughter played by the beautiful Thora Birch and he kind of ends up having a thing for her friend, Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) which is the weirdest thing I've ever seen. The film is full of bits of nudity, perversion, sex scenes, Mena Suvari in a bath of red roses and Kevin Spacey being a jerk and creepy and sometimes funny but also drugs are involved. Great film in everyway from the great acting down to the beautifully shot red roses scenes and blah de blah. Mena Suvari is very beautiful and gives a good performance, Annette Benning is a bit boring but she doesn't ruin the film and Wes Bentley films Thora Birch from his window and Wes Bentley plays some weird next door neighbour with a homophobic dad who is convinced his son is having some gay relationship with Lester (Kevin Spacey) next door but he's not all there if you catch my drift. Some weird moments but beautifully executed film and a great movie."

Considered one of the 100 best films ever by more than one list written by more than one authority on the subject, he has won five Academy Awards from the Hollywood Academy (Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Photography) and three Globes of Gold (Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay). It's an enviable record for a movie that, when we look at it, doesn't seem to justify it ... In fact, just looking at the Oscar nominees for Best Movie in that far 2000s, I liked \"The Insider\" or \"a lot more\" The Green Mile \"than this movie, which basically portrays the unfulfilled fantasies of a middle-aged, suburban middle-class man whenIn fact, the American middle class is portrayed here in an almost dystopian way: a social group wrapped in huge paranoia about appearances and \"looking good,\" obsessed with politically correct and socially acceptable, trying to keep secrets, taboos, prejudices and imperfections hidden through a beautiful house, a spotless lawn, a new car, a good tie. The patriarch of the family lives a crisis of middle age through the nostalgia of past and underused youth, to the point of feeling a sudden sexual attraction for a teenager. His wife, in turn, is the archetype of frivolity and emptiness, living a marriage of appearances and discounting everything through an extramarital affair. The daughter of this dysfunctional couple is the typical young rebel ... until she decides to plot with her boyfriend to kill her own father. And there is much more throughout the movie. Cartoon characters in a dystopian and uncomfortable portrait, especially for those who identify with the US suburban middle class (not my case at all).Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening and Thora Birch are the central trio of actors who bring life to a family that is beyond normal. Nevertheless, the three had excellent performances and in fact deserved to be awarded and recognized for that. Mena Suvari also looked good to me as the provocative nymphet. Sam Mendes ensured careful, bold and inspired driving. Having been the first film in which he participated as a director, it was certainly a milestone in his career and secured a future for him.Provocative, bold, disturbing, is a movie where taboos are put in check and troublesome truths are exposed. It is not at all a family movie or to see with children and young people nearby."
