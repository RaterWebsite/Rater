A little more insight on the politics of Rome and how it shaped Pontius Pilate's decisions.  A little to clich\u00e9 in the acting, but an okay film."

      "text": "I am a pretty harsh critic of typical Christian film making. This one, however, was very well done. The story is plausible; it does a good job of capturing an accurate cultural, historical and religious context for its setting. There are a lot of little details it gets right. The writing and acting are good. And the story doesn't try to do too much. It doesn't overreach.\r Granted, there are places that stretch the historical record and biblical accounts, but not dramatically so. But this story isn't a biblical account, so some liberties are expected and necessary.  I think the film will be under appreciated for the effort put into the making of the film convincingly fit within the biblical frame, even among Christians, which is a shame.\r All in all, though, a very good film and I would absolutely recommend it. The message is Christian.  If themes like sacrifice, forgiveness, loving your enemies, salvation and unconditional love offends you, you'll want to avoid the film.  Otherwise, enjoy."

It really is faithful to the original story of Jesus, but also completely different as the story of a Roman Tribune commanded to find the body of Jesus to quell the new messiah movement.  Jesus is played by an excellent choice of actor, and the Fiennes is awesome!"

      "text": "We were expecting a fairly lenient story of Christianity in its early form but this was a surprise.  The story begins with the crucifixion of Jesus and has the Romans in Judea hunting for His body. This side of the story has NOT been told before by the secular media and so ratings that say it is \"another telling\" don't know their Sunday school stories.  The music is beautiful and the story itself will inspire you to ask, \"How would I go about solving this mystery if I was put in charge to do so?\"  Highly recommended."

      "text": "I have seen that most of the negative reviews of this movie come from people who are more upset about the message than any particular scene or actors' abilities. Truth be told, this was a well acted movie that really made me think of what it would have been like to be one of  the eleven disciples. The movie's purpose was not to offer proof of the resurrection. This is where I think many who don't believe in the resurrection err, they were looking for the movie to convince them. That is not what the movie sets out to do, instead it is meant to detail the commotion that such events as Jesus's resurrection and the 40 days he spent on earth afterward would have made in the region. It does that masterfully without going over the top.\r From a movie perspective, the acting was good all around. I like the character who played Barnabas, he was just the kind of crazy you would have expected some of the disciples to be. Remember, all but one of these men died a martyr's death for preaching the Gospel of Christ. There is no record of even one recantation from any of these men, that is a miracle in itself. If you think it was a lie, try to convince eleven men under penalty of death, to stick to any story, true or otherwise. These men refused to recant knowing the consequences, they even refused to stop preaching it, amazing. Not to spoil anything, the way Barnabas acts when he appears before Clavius I thought was really well done. Of course Clavius was also very well done and a very believable character. Jesus looked like he was from the Middle East for the first time ever in a big movie production, and while not talking a lot, was convincing in the role. Peter's actor reminded me a lot of Tevye from Fiddler on the Roof. All around, it was just good acting.\r My biggest disappointment with the movie was that some very cool details were left out. I know that movies have to cut things to keep it moving along and that the movie is never as good as the book though :)."

      "text": "I have to admit, even as someone who believes in God it is hard for me to fully enjoy the majority of faith-based films. It's not just because their budgets only allow for subpar, flat actors and presentation, but also the usually corny writing that goes along with them. More often than not Christian movies feature plots that come off more as sermons than genuinely believable scenarios.\r When I first saw the trailers for Risen I thought that this could very well be the movie to go against those typical constants. It was evident it had some actual money behind it, but it was a compelling set up. Having finally seen it I am happy to say that not only did Risen meet my expectations, it even exceeded them in several ways.\r For starters the attention to detail from the historical side of things is impressive. It's got little touches here and there that really sell the era. Another praise I have is that it isn't preachy. The movie just tells it's story without throwing little lessons in their for the audience. As a result the movie is more likely to appeal to nonbelievers, and might actually succeed in doing what so many of these faith-based movies fail to do; getting people actually interested in learning about God.\r The movie manages to capture emotion without coming off as melodramatic (another issue with Christian filmmaking). It even throws in some action and humor to go along with the mystery. To put it simply, Clavius' search for the body of Jesus is one worth watching. The writing is just all around better than what I've come to expect form these films.\r So are the performances for that matter. Joseph Fiennes is outstanding as Clavius. He's perfectly suited for playing a Roman tribune. He gives those interrogation scenes the necessary intimidation and weight needed for them to succeed and not bore the audience. The entire cast is just as fantastic. Cliff Curtis as (non-white!) Jesus is a welcome treat. This is easily one of my favorite portrayals of the Son of God. Actors like Tom Felton (of Harry Potter fame) give the supporting cast a heck of a lot of talent as well.\r All in all Risen is what the majority of faith-based, Christian movies aren't. It doesn't feel cheap and is backed by incredible writing and performances. However it's not just the fact that it's better than the average film of this type that makes Risen so incredible. It's also that it's an all around original and excellent idea brought to life by talented direction and attention to detail. Regardless of your beliefs, so long as you don't actively have something against religion (of this form or another), then you should enjoy this film in at least some capacity. As for me I found the films to be a stunning work. One I highly recommend seeing.\r 9.9/10"

      "text": "\"I want to believe.\" Approach this as an X-Files episode and you'll be fine. An X-Files episode that just so happens to depict the seminal moment in Catholic orthodoxy. The point of view is that of the Roman Tribune Clavius played with steely grit by Joseph Fiennes, who is tasked with the nasty business of cleaning up Pilate's claim to fame: the crucifixion of Jesus.\r The movie is a solid historical period piece for three quarters of the film. It plays more like a murder mystery as Clavius tries to track down the whereabouts of the new disciples who represent a threat to the governing status quo, and more importantly, the crucified body that has vanished from the tomb under supernatural circumstances. Clavius doggedly kicks in doors and interviews witnesses, trying to make sense of it all before an expected visit by Pilate's boss. Then ultimately the producers show their cards and go all in on the Clavius conversion as he ultimately helps the disciples escape and rendezvous with Jesus at Galilee.\r This film was made by the Sony denominational studio Affirm Films, so the payoff for the expected demographic is not at all unexpected. Before the film started, there were a string of previews for upcoming faith-based features, so Hollywood has clearly identified a reasonably fallow market over the past few years. The difference now is we are slowly starting to see better talent and production values in some of these efforts.\r Risen should not be avoided purely because you may be a religious skeptic, just as you should not avoid a film about, say, strange lights in Roswell NM just because you don't believe in UFOs."

Feels like a 20 minute movie elongated to match a standard movie timing, after you've finished the movie you instantly forget more than half of it because there was nothing going on. Still, innovative and interesting storyline and good acting."

      "text": "It's something beyond a manhunt...\r I just want to review it as a film, so my take on this is pure based on the entertainment and technical aspect, not historical or the religious stuff.\r The story was not bad, which is set in the Israel 33AD where a Roman man tells his story what he just went through. So the flashback begins, just like an unofficial sequel to 'The Passion of the Christ', the story continues after the crucifiction of Yeshua.\r Sealed the tomb with the roman mark and guarded it by an armed force, the body of Yeshua goes missing. With the widespread speculation going around and the order from a higher authority, the Roman soldiers led by Clavius attempts to locate the body by following the hints. So the rest of the story is racing against the time where many unexpected and strange events follows.\r It was a perfect setting for a tale like this. The characters were good, but in the end it certainly questions their actions based in what purpose. It was told from a Roman perspective and his transformation to what he ultimately believes.\r The details were good while depicting the events. A simple narration with not so fancy stunts and others tricks, yet somewhere it loses its realistic approach to the supernatural thing.\r Since they did not mention anything related to the real account, it is fairly debatable yet not worth debating seriously. Because different people have different opinion regarding religious, historical and entertainment angle. But absolutely this film is target every one of them.\r This kind of films is worth watching, because each writer, filmmaker gives us a different take on the person who is behind the world's largest faith. So 'liked it' or 'didn't like' should come after the view. Though it was a quite enjoyable film.\r 6/10"

It sticks to the source more than most biblical films usually do, but its just so boring. this movie is 40 minutes to long it spends most of the movie trying to get us to know the main character as best as we can, but that should 30 minutes of the film when it takes this movie almost an hour. The last chunk of the movie is pretty interesting but takes the film to long to get that point. In conclusion if you like the biblical story this is based you'll like this film, but if you don't than stay away from this."

Especially for a proud Roman.Joseph Fiennes, the lead actor has done a marvelously great job in portraying the turmoil and chaos that goes on through His mind regarding the life-changing fact of the Resurrection. The testimony of the second guard in the tavern was raw and beautifully portrayed. Great acting performance. Fantastic work done by the script-writers. The soundtrack is beautiful. Mesmerizingly beautiful. and I have had it on repeat for days on end now! It is just that good. It takes you so well into the setting of the movie, and reminds you constantly of the first century Jewish and Roman times.I encourage you to watch this movie and gift it to a non-believer too.
