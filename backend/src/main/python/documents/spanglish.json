      "text": "I don't typically watch movies like this, so I'm not sure exactly how to review it. The only reason I picked it up is because I'm a huge Adam Sandler fan. The characters are well acted and the script is well written. It's funny, sweet, and at the same time heartbreaking. I really enjoyed this movie, but I do have some complaints, like I wish they had focused more on the clasky's kids. The son character is practically nonexistent in the movie, and I would have enjoyed more scenes so that we could learn more about how the daughter character is dealing with the rejection by her mother. But maybe it's best that they didn't as even without them the movie still manages to be great. And while the final product still pleases, I'm still left wondering what this movie would have been like if they had included them more. Still it's a great movie and one I do recommend."

While some people may be put off by the fact that Adam Sandler is one of the main characters, he does put a great performance. In the end, it's a pretty effective movie."

      "text": "Spanglish is a heavy-handed dramedy that hasn't aged particularly well, but when it works, it REALLY works. There are lot of well acted, honest moments, and this is one of Adam Sandler's better performances. It feels real and truthful, and the script actually isn't half bad either. There is a lot of wasted space and time in the movie, but if you like a good melodrama or family comedy, this isn't a bad choice."

      "text": "This movie loves all its characters, each with their own foibles and hardships. The script bubbles with whimsy and intelligence. There are many laugh out loud moments, but the humor always emerges from characters naturally, and advances their development. Two families converge, a Mexican immigrant turned au pair and her pubescent daughter, and a successful chef, his wife, their son and daughter and her alcoholic mother. Nearly every adult family member hurts the others incidentally--most sadly their children--as they pursue their own, not unworthy goals. But through the grace of a platonic romance between the chef and au pair, the convergent families nudge each into mindful repair of their relationships and a healthier view of themselves. Wonderful acting, especially a superlative Tea Leoni. This movie inspires and delights so, you won't walk away from it, you'll float. And your feet won't have to touch the ground, for a little while at least."

      "text": "The worst movie I've seen in years. Misogynistic crap: i.e. we are meant to laugh at a woman because she makes faces while having an orgasm, wants sex, and is bored since losing her job. And the contrast made with the supportive, maternal, sensual, and 'salt-of-the-earth' Latina maid is just a counterpoint of stereotypes (racial, gender, and class). Most of all though the film is all about support for Sandler (your hardworking everyman with a dream) and mean brutal hatred for his one-dimensional wife (Leoni). Invidious and evil stuff."

The mom in this movie does bug me but her character is very important and you're not meant to like her all that much. I have watched this movie more than once and it's still a good time to watch a second or third time. I also like to see Adam Sandler in a more serious movie that's not always like his bad comedies. Spanglish is worth watching."
