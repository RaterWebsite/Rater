      "text": "The Judge is a departure from Robert Downey Jr as he has been potraying Iron Man for the past several years and hasn't done much of anything else that was significant. This movie displays a great performance from him and it seems to me as if he is almost playing Iron Man again at the first of the movie but it morphs into so much more than that before. Robert Duvall was great in The Judge as well. This movie really triggered my emotions and I think it could very well be the best movie I've seen this year and its certainly worth watching."

Robert Downey Jr. and Rober Duvall were absolutely brilliant as they played themselves basically.  The supporting cast was outstanding.  You sat on the edge of your seat listening to the back and forth barbs as you soon realizes that both father and son are hard asses and if you look in the mirror you would see the other.  The story was very sentimental in which the father becomes the son and the son the father.  It's a very good movie that theater audiences will see as word of mouth will spread."

Melodramatic movie about an evading son Robert Downey who became a good lawyer despite his far from ethical life, and his father Robert Duvall who has a judgement derailed by his love for his evading son. The storyline revolves about the family fate deeply hurt by, Robert Downey, the son who flew away from family and probable love. The family reunites again when the mother dies and the father is accused of hit and run killing. The past is revived, and the humanly true feelings are uncovered. An acting game that is not to be missed, the movie isn't though a box office magnet."

We enjoyed this movie, with the many subplots (that's probably where the criticism comes from). It has excellent acting from all. I did wonder why it was never explained what the youngest son mental problems were about. I especially enjoyed Downey's character's quickness with figuring the legal angles. All in all, it was a story about a family's love, despite their many differences and faults which clash. Good scenery too!"

Looking at the poster itself seemed like a boring movie but the surprisingly weak plot-twist (SPOILER) like the girl he made out is his daughter, turns out to be his niece and later on his own daughter having similarities to her was interesting and funny. They approached the audience well, its a movie about a man who had father issues and addressed it well. You cant be coming into this movie thinking its going to be Iron Man 3 and having to be a movie about attorneys, they had to make it somewhat interesting for the audience. Good movie to see with a friend or brother and sister!"

      "text": "In an ideal Metacritic world I would give this film a 6.5.\u2026\u2026almost single-handedly Robert Downey Jr.   nearly pulls it off and brings the huge disabled cruise ship that is \u201cThe Judge\u201c to safe harbor\u2026.Downey creates a character that is so intriguing and somehow \u201cnew\u201d that the film almost succeeds in holding our interest very much in spite of its unwieldy and all-over-the-map script and direction.\u2026\u2026My feeling is that the film is worth seeing almost exclusively because of the opportunity to watch Downey and Robert Duvall \u201cdo their stuff\u201d; each provides a sort of master classes in acting\u2026..\r However, the film as a whole suffers SO badly from its impulse to go madly in all directions that it begins to feel more like a television mini-series crammed into a feature film format than an actual successful drama. Both the director and the script writer lack a sense of the those crucial boundaries that any film genre needs to accommodate and \u201cThe Judge\u201d loses its way as indulges in far too many (almost whimsical) dramatic angles and possibilities i.e,\u2026.is this a psychological family drama ? a courtroom drama ? a film noir? a thriller? a coming-of-age story?\u2026\u2026worst of all when the film begins to lose its way and grow quite muddled, the solution choice appears to be to pile on EVEN MORE plot developments\u2026and this is  what eventually very nearly \u201csinks\u201d it (despite Downey and Duvall\u2019s very strong performances)\u2026\r \u2026\u2026a good example of a film that succeeds in being a legal/courtroom drama AND a psychological thriller is the George Clooney film \u201cMichael Clayton\u201d- a really remarkable achievement and one of the best American films I have seen in decades \u2026.and another example is the more modest achievement of the Matt Damon film \u201cThe Rainmaker\u201d of several years back\u2026.both these films respect the limitations of the film genre they\u2019re working in while at the same time cautiously stretching the material to add new dimensions \u2026\u2026 \u201cThe Judge\u201d tries  hard to do this but fails; it is an interesting failure, however, and hopefully the director will one day learn to reign in his overly ambitious narrative impulses\u2026\u2026\r \u2026....another criticism I have is that the dialogue in the film is frequently frankly unbelievable and over-the-top witty and clever \u2026.many of these characters would have to be geniuses or near-geniuses to come up with the things they come out with and  Downey\u2019s character especially often comes across as a sort of combination of Sherlock Holmes, James Bond and Zorro ! In fact dangerously close to the superhero Downey has now played in THREE \u201cIron Man\u201d films !.... It's not be a stretch I think to suggest that at this point in his career Downey needs to watch out for  Iron Man Damage !\u2026..\r My final criticism of this film is is its lack of any clear FOCUS. In fact, at times it feels more like a dream the director is having than an actual  movie and the narrative line all but disappears in a muddled and undisciplined phantasmagoria and this is really too bad because there is in fact a lot to like here; hence my ideal 6.5 rating."

      "text": "John Grisham, the former lawyer turned novelist, has become known for his action packed, courtroom conspiracies. These films are always full of twists and unlikely heroes, but in his latest film, The Judge, Grisham takes a step back. The lawyers he creates have always been young and smart, but inexperienced and in over their heads, this time, it's just the opposite. Hank Palmer (Robert Downey Jr.) has left his small town upbringing behind and has become one of the biggest criminal defense attorneys in the country. Law has always been in his family, as his father, Joseph (Robert Duvall) has been a judge in that small town for nearly fifty years. Hank is home for a rare visit, when he starts to notice his father is deteriorating, but does little about it. One night, The Judge goes out to the store and hits someone with his car, his son contends, it was a simple accident, but the district attorney thinks it's something more, due to the Judge's former connection with the victim. Despite them never seeing eye to eye, and despite the Judge's stubbornness, he sees no choice but to let his big shot son defend him. Both actors in this film are terrific, few are as good as Robert Duvall, but the chemistry in this film is a bit of a problem. Robert Duvall is always this humble soft spoken guy, that pulls at the heart strings, but Robert Downey Jr. has a personality that's bigger than life itself. While Duvall was amazing, Downey Jr. always seemed to overpower him in their scenes together. The combination made for a few good laughs, but overall, Downey's personality overshadows the empathy the crowd had for Duvall. The bottom line, The Judge may not be John Grisham's most thrilling work, but it does pose some interesting questions of law and explores the necessity of a father/son relationship, even when the two parties don't really get along."

The acting, particularly by Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Duvall elevate this film above all the clich\u00e9s that you know are coming.\r On the verge of divorce, after finding his wife has cheated on him, and his mother having died, Chicago lawyer Hank (Downey Jr.) returns to his small hometown in Indiana where his father (Duvall) has been a judge for 38 years and sober for 28. Hank\u2019s older brother Glen (Vincent D\u2019Onofrio) had been a promising baseball player is now a married man with children who works in a tire store and a younger brother, Dale, (Jeremy Strong) who, due to mental disabilities, constantly has a camera in his hand recording everything.\r In spite of two or three twists and turns there are all the familiar scenarios including a high school girlfriend Sam (Vera Farmiga) who has a fatherless daughter who was born 9 months after Hank left town, a hyper young waitress Carla (Leighton Meester), who comes on to Hank along with a only in Hollywood storyline that makes for Hank to take on the defense of the judge who is accused of murder. This brings in a country bumpkin lawyer, Dax Shepard, which makes it necessary to be helped by Hank, along with slick opposing prosecuting lawyer, Dwight (Billy Bob Thornton) is holding a grudge against Hank. There is a completely unnecessary story involving Hank\u2019s far too precocious daughter Lauren (Emma Trembay) showing that both the judge and her father have a soft side.\r Both Downey Jr. and Duvall bring their A game to the movie, especially in a scene that could have been a complete turn off, and Farmiga lights up the screen in her scenes with Downey Jr. Billy Bob Thornton brings gravitas to the film with another one of his fine performances and is getting better looking every year as he grows older.\r The direction by David Dobkin, along with the screenplay by Nick Schenk and Bill Dubuque, follow a course we have seen many times before brought to a higher level by the acting. The director of photography Janusz Kaminski, brings a Hollywood image of small town perfection to the film with everything green and shining. There is a breathtaking scene looking out from a restaurant that is shown twice."

Maybe someone else like, preferable anyone else (except for Michael Bay or M. Night Shamaylan). Also, the film stretches certain scenes that come off as unnecessary. But despite its flaws, Robert Duvall is the saving grace of this film. His character holds the movie together and is the true character that we come to truly know and love. Robert Downey Jr. is good in the role, but I wish this movie could have been something more, but overall, it's just an enjoyable for the main purpose of Robert Duvall and the court case scenes primarily.

Duvall, now 84, has appeared in dozens of movies, but no blockbuster hits since the 1970\u2019s - 1980\u2019s.  Robert Downey Jr. has the lead role.  I find that both actors can be either really interesting or really tedious.  As a result I wasn\u2019t expecting too much, and was pleasantly surprised to find that the movie is much more watchable than the reviews would indicate.  Duval plays an aging small town judge with high standards and an impeccable record, who may have committed a murder.  Robert Downey Jr. plays the prodigal son, who left town many years ago with a chip on his shoulder and has become a talented and cynical lawyer who defends wealthy sleaze balls.  The story is more about the redemption of their relationship and finding their humanity for each other, than it is a courtroom drama. (It\u2019s certainly less dramatic than something like, say \u201cThe Client.\u201d)  It a feel good movie, and a worthy rental, but Given Edward Norton\u2019s performance in Birdman, I think it\u2019s doubtful that Duvall will win."

While much of Downey's grandstanding is enjoyable and Duvall's performance is exceptional, this screenplay is chocked full of cliches and an overabundance of mean-spirited interactions.

I concede that at times it seems in danger of toppling into paint by number TV movie of the week territory, but to its credit this doesn't actually happen. The two Roberts, Downey jnr and Duval, play off against each other perfectly, even if for me Downey Jnr has the edge. He never puts a facial expression wrong and I believed his character totally.\rA bathroom scene between the pair starts off shockingly but, with perfectly judged precision, becomes lighter as the scene progresses. The delicacy of the playing here makes these moments a highlight.\rThe supporting cast don't really have a lot to do but are all more than adequate and the screenplay to its credit does offer up a fair share of surprising plot twists.\rOn the negative side the score single handedly threatens to derail the whole thing as it is far too syrupy. Indeed, this is where the mush is coming from, not the story or the actors. Also, the coda in the boat comes on like 'On Golden Pond'. All that's missing is Katharine Hepburn and the loons!"

Rex reed gave this move 4 stars so it gets 100 here, that doesn't seem right.   I don't believe for a second that anyone honestly feels this is a perfect movie.\r Its far from being a terrible movie but its got more cliches per square inch than anything I've ever seen.  Writing a character that is described as \"big city lawyer\" should be up there with villains twirling their long mustaches to show they are evil in this day and age.  it also has an industrial heart string pulling machine in it because they try for everything.  Here are some of the things that the film makers hope you can identify with:\r Strained relationship with a parent\rCancer\rDead mom\rFunerals!\rSmall town living\rRegrets from being an out of control teen\r None of it really matters because its star power that drives this ship and for the past month I've been hearing and reading people basically going nuts for RDJ.  OMG I love RDJ, he is the best... why is Ironman in court? its Tony Stark goes to Washington I'm totally going to watch it.

It was an Oscar-nomination vehicle for Robert Duvall in the title role, who roared through the script so that even his clich\u00e9d lines sounded like originals when spoken by such a legendary actor. However, the film was a disappointment for Robert Downey, Jr. in the role of the sharp, city-slicker lawyer, Hank Palmer. Downey has told the press that he covets an Oscar, and this was the first attempt  from the ma & pa production company with the unlikely name \u201cTeam Downey\u201d to get him a nomination.\r Although Downey has his moments, there is still more than a hint of the Iron Man persona lurking underneath the attorney's expensive suit and designer sunglasses. Downey is still magnificent to behold with his intensity and his sensitive dark eyes as he deals with a father who is so stubborn that he is self-destructive. And his character's  questionable ethics as a brilliant lawyer who can get anyone to walk suits his problematic personality. (He is his usual hyperactive self in the film, which is written into the script when his ex-girlfriend says he talks continuously \u201clike vomit.\u201d) When accused of only defending the guilty, Downey\u2019s best line is, \u201cInnocent people can\u2019t afford me.\u201d\r A surprisingly effective performance pops up in the form of Billy Bob Thornton, who plays Dwight Dickham, a steely lawyer with an ax to grind, and even when he sees his enemy defeated and broken down in tears, his sense of humanity, which arises only for a moment, is quickly suppressed. There are some philosophical thoughts about the nature of justice buried in the script, but many weak areas prevail. Hank Palmer has two brothers. The older brother (Vincent D\u2019Onofrio) seems to bear no relation to him; the younger brother (Jeremy Strong) is autistic but the autistic personality is not consistently portrayed.\r Much to my amusement, Downey has a few love scenes in this film, and he actually has a scene with an onscreen wife. Of course, the only reason he appeared with a wife was to make it clear that they hated each other and were definitely getting a divorce. His love scene with the young bartender (Leighton Meester) shows them kissing only briefly, and it\u2019s a long shot. The more complicated kissing scenes with his hometown ex-girlfriend (Vera Farmiga) look a little stiff and uncomfortable. So I had to smile when Farmiga remarked in an interview that producer Susan Downey was on the set the whole time, and that Farmiga kept looking over to Mrs. Downey for approval because, after all, Susan Downey kisses her husband all the time. So that explains the robotic moves. Farmiga is a great actress; it\u2019s hard to make her look wooden.\r I suspect that if Robert Downey wants an Oscar nomination, he should issue an edict announcing that the producer isn\u2019t allowed on the set."

Not to mention the fact that the film resonated with me very strongly because of how much I could relate to a big chunk of what was going on as well as the characters themselves. Plus it's nice to see RDJ play someone else other than Tony Stark again, though the character he portrays does admittedly have shades of Stark in him."

      "text": "The Judge's main flaw is the overabundance of clich\u00e9d characters, from the title role itself to that of Billy Bob Thornton, Also, trying to establish moral high-ground and raise questions of legality, specifically the case when something \"feels\" just but the law says it isn't. Well, at the end of the film, those issues remain unaddressed, and while everybody loves an open ending, this is not the case. It could be the multitude of sub-stories (relationships with the brothers, with the ex girlfriend, with the ex wife, with the daughter) that make The Judge seem generally unfinished, despite the 2-hour duration.\r Robert Downey Jr's comedy sure is entertaining, but I wonder if it was appropriate most times, given the seriousness of the topic. Robert Duvall's character is one we've seen dozens of times (stone-cold father trying to prepare his son for the hardships of life), therefore it doesn't leave much room for acting. It feels like the rest of the cast, in spite of the tiny screen-time, did a better job than the leads.\r I'd also like to point out the annoying soundtrack choices."

On the other hand there are multiple sub plots that are just pointless and makes the film about 30 minutes to long.  The performances alone get this film a recommendation. B"

Stereotypes, cliches, and corniness galore: overly demanding authoritarian dad, slick city lawyer returns to small town, sympathetic mentally disabled son, star athlete son whose career was cut short by tragedy.  And worst of all, a goofy, small town lawyer who's so nervous he throws up every day before court.  So we're to believe that after sitting on the bench for 40 years, this is the best a county judge could get to defend himself on a murder charge?   Such an insult to Duvall, Downey and co. The only believable characters/performances were Vera Farmiga and Billy Bob Thornton in supporting roles.  The Duvall best actor nomination was obviously a lifetime achievement nod: he's a great actor, but this was his worst performance I've seen."

Duvall is brilliant, and the movie's themes of reputation and abandonment really come through in a couple crucial scenes. But don't let that deter you from seeing it: those crucial scenes are what make the whole movie worth watching. Other than that, all that's left are the usual separated couple with a young daughter, cocky lawyer, honest and tough father, family drama, and rekindling with an old flame. The \"small town\" setting is the right choice for this movie, and it does its best to incorporate everything else."

      "text": "Robert Duvall\u202c is outstanding and so is Robert Downey Jr.\r Little outbursts and disagreements of the duo have been executed brilliantly and framed exceptionally well by \u202aDobkin\u202c. The bit where Duvall rushes up in high squall carrying a temper whilst Downey follows for war is one of the most dramatic scenes that shows how puny nature is against human commotion! Humour is strewn in the movie and when you have Downey with the bat, it always makes home runs.\r Drenched with drama the movie has an apt theme that runs around the convicted irony - the Judge who isn't willing to let his guard down and who hates his middle son Downey for so many irreparable reasons that he can't just give in. Whilst Downey, the forlorn child who never returned to his parents owing to the long born and bred abomination he burnt in, tries to save him from the clouded murder of a foul-mouthed obnoxious hill-billy.\r The score is apt and the screenplay is intense. Loved how Dobkin carried it all. The amount of focus he put in, in every frame is worth commending. A must watch for Downey's wit lovers and also for dramaholics."

It hits almost every cliche on the head from big city lawyer goes home to a small town to a father and son fishing on the lake with a whole sandwich of other cringy/yet surprisingly forgivable sequences, mostly due to RDJ's black tie humour.\r My biggest complaint has to be the court case. The story behind it and build up kind of felt like someone letting the air out of a deflating balloon in a cactus farm."

      "text": "I realized that some newspapers such as The New York Times were very critical of this film, but I believe that this film is the best acting Robert Duvall has done since \"Apocalypse Now.\"  His wild tough as nails performance may well be an Oscar contender.  Robert Downey Jr. is the big city lawyer/prodigal son who returns home.  His tough, often sarcastic and arrogant legal arguments are compelling, yet he has a softer, sentimental side.  The local color of rural Indiana adds so much beauty and small town feel to this drama, as does the Bon Iver song, \"Holocene,\" which is used in the beginning and end of the film.  The resolution of the family feud is not what one would expect, yet the end is poignant and heartfelt, yielding a very American story that is brawling, yet full of sentiment and heartfelt family stories we can all identify."
