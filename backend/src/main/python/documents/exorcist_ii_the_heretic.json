      "text": "Si, es una pel\u00edcula bastante deficiente, la historia es deliberadamente confusa, rid\u00edculamente sin pies ni cabeza, raz\u00f3n de ser e innecesariamente compleja, el hecho de ser precedida por la mejor pel\u00edcula de terror de todos los tiempos ya complicaba mucho la recepci\u00f3n de esta infame secuela, pero en el fondo no es tan mala si tan solo olvidas por un momento la existencia de El Exorcista original.Si existe algo que se pueda destacar positivamente es la banda sonora y nada m\u00e1s."

      "rating": "1",
      "text": "Truly terrible film. I can\u2019t even think of any reason to watch this. There was one second shot of someone stepping on spikes which was entertaining and some bits on rocks which looked alright. The rest of the film is painful incomprehensible crap. I believe that this is the worst film ever made. Do not watch. Atrocious."

      "text": "the exorcist 2 is a rare and at the same time disastrous movie, unfortunately it is one of the worst sequels I have seen despite the fact that it has great actors and a good director. A failure in all respects but with beautiful photography and very few aesthetically beautiful scenes."
