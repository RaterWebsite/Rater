Everything about it is just plain annoying. The best part of the whole movie is when the wildebeasts sing the \"I'm Having A Nice Day\" song, and the only reason I like that part is because it's easy to annoy people by singing it nonstop. And it's the only thing I really remember other than the story is like the version of Madagascar that got thrown out and some body picked it out of the trash and made it, the most annoying voice I've ever heard for the lead character, and other mismatched voices that didn't seem to fit very well, jokes that weren't funny... I could go on and on. But I wont. This movie sucks."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "It's like someone threw Madagascar into a blender with Finding Nemo. The plot is very unoriginal, the humor is overly silly and childish, and the characters aren't very memorable. As far as animation goes, it's alright. Not necessarily bad, just... alright. All in all, The Wild is an mediocre, overly goofy mish-mash of stories that have already been told before. Definitely NOT something you would expect from Disney. 3/10."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "There's that one laugh here and there but al in all this was a hard film to watch do to the fact that you want to shut up every one of those animals mouths.

So nice try Disney maybe next time"}, {"rating": "0", "text": "I took my 3 year old to see it and HE wanted to leave! This movie is Horrible. I'm dissapointed in Disney. I don't understand why Disney needs to stamp out movie after movie, where the main character doesn't have a MOM, and there is unnecessary violence and scary scenes. \"Hey Disney... you're making CHILDREN'S movies, REMEMBER!\" The Wild is boring, doesn't make any sense, a rip-off, too scary, too stupid.

Visually stunning to behold it's sometimes difficult get into the story because you are so wow'd by the visuals.

A film similar to this, Madagascar, got all the attention, but in retrospect, this is a far better story.  It actually HAS a story.  Voice talent is good particularly eddie izzard as a not so lovable koala.  Visually there's a lot to see and there are some nice shots, but the realistic take could have been more fun if they animals did more broadly funny stuff that would take advantage of the fact that this is animated and not live-action.

You get The Wild, a steaming pile of unfunny, unexciting, and just plain boring crap with average visuals, no witty jokes, no gross-out jokes, no smart jokes, no slapstick jokes, no innenuendo jokes, just a lot of really, really, bad gags taped together to a rip-off of a bad movie.

There is no heart in this film just a lot of dumb laughs. The characters are not good at all. Most of them are either soulless and/or exist to get a cheap laugh or have dumb jokes. It doesn\u2019t help that the animation is ugly. Even without comparing it to Madagascar and how this movie is a rip off of that one this movie sucks. Unless you are a toddler who has no taste in film I would recommend avoiding this movie at all costs it is a whole lot of nothing. It is depressing to see Disney sink this low (I\u2019ve heard it was another animation company that did this but still regardless no studio should have this on their track record)."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Extremely funny and a good movie for kids, and even better adults won't be bored out of their minds watching it. The story is a lot like Madagascar, animals escape from the zoo and got to \"The Wild\", so it's not all that original but it's funny enough to keep you and your kids entertained on a family movie night. Worth a rental."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "The plot, settings and entire idea is unfortunately almost identical to 'Madagascar'.  Its all completely and totally predictable with visual gags that have been used all before. The animation isn't that bad, a different style to 'Madagascar' with fur effects giving a little more realism, Ryan the cub is undeniably cute. The wildebeests actually look pretty cool I though, quite evil and I liked the little intro animation revolving around them at the start.\r Shame they chose to include modern pop music within the film but other than that its a fair animation that is fun to watch.

The plot is terrible, the movie is not funny, and it's all been done before. Worse, much of it doesn't make sense. A tugboat that can cross the ocean? Chameleons that can make things invisible? WTF? Hell no! That's unacceptable!!! It's as if the movie didn't exist. So don't watch it. It's garbage. No one cares about The Wild.
