      "text": "This is one of the 5 worst movies I have ever seen.  Remember the story about the Emperor and his new clothes, everyone pretended they saw the clothes, just so they would not be the only person to say, um, Emperor, you are naked!  That is how I feel about this movie, I do not mind being the only one to say this movie was horrible, horrid, awful and a huge waste of time and money.  My wife actually fell asleep in the movie, and thought it was just as dreadful as I did.  I rate a movie like this: I must see it the day it comes out, or, I will see it the weekend it first comes out, or, I will see it at a theater, or, I will wait for it to come out on HBO, or, I will wait for it to come out on free TV, or, I will charge someone $1000 to make me see it....this is the last option.  DO NOT SEE!"
