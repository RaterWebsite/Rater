I do not think the Christian Nazis are the problem as they do not go to Hollywood movies anyway. The only reason I went to see it was that the Pope said that I should not. Until then I thought that it was just another mind numbing fantasy for children like Lord (Bored) of the Ring. I fell asleep during the first LOFR movie and have not watched any of the sequels. GC was two hours long but only seemed like an hour. I have gone back and seem it twice more. Once to catch the details I missed the first time and again to analyze the story. I hope the sequels will not have to be dumbed down even more for the US audience just to get a higher box office."

Obviously elements of the book had to be left out, otherwise the film would be too long, but the director failed to capture the suspense in the book. This left the brilliant actors very little to work with and develop their characters, despite many strong performances on their part. The ending was typical Hollywood, in that the sad ending in the book is completely missing. An enjoyable film, but could've have been great."

The book was brilliant, probably the best of the trilogy and very dark for a \"children's\" book. People expected the film to follow suit and follow Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings with it's careful character development and deliberately slow pacing. People expected a dark fable with a 12a rating that asked as many questions as the book did about religion, life, death and everything in between. What we have is film which seems to have achieved the impossible, to actually be entertaining universally. As a parent these types of films are like goldust, I have fallen asleep through so many disney/dreamworks productions recently and been ripped off by their merchandise. My 5 yr old daughter loved it and I thought even without the appropriate amount of character development and rushed scenes it encapsulated enough of the book's magic to make it one of the finest fantasy films in recent years. Ignore the critics who are all in their mid-40s, single and voice a demographic rather than a universal opinion."

Having read the books and enjoyed them, I found the movie built on my visualizations of Pullman's original creation. The armoured bears and witches were stunning, and I found Mrs Coulter and Lyra to be engaging characters in the film adaptation. I recall thinking after seeing the changed ending of Jackson's Fellowship of the Rings from the books and being shocked, but later after seeing the context of the 3 movies, I appreciated the deviation from the source material. Similarly, having the ideology of the book presented more subtly in the film probably kept it from feeling too \"preachy\". All in all, I hope to see a sequel. (Finally, how can people give this film a zero? Even if you found it lacking, it wasn't Daredevil or League of Extraordinary Gentlemen)."

The film tries to be faithful to the books, using many scenes verbatim and actually to the point where the speed of the plot and exposition is too fast. However, the characters are strong (although Lyra's not as urchin-y as Pullman's), and the film retains much of the charm of the book. I only complain of the parts Chris Weitz deviates from the story at the expense of realism or plot aesthetics. Specifically, three of the best chapters in the book are removed, for no good reason. The film is even rather short, post-climax-ectomy."

      "text": "Prepare to enter another world of the fantasy genre as New Line Cinema (the producer of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy) presents Chris Wietz's \"The Golden Compass\". It revolves around Lyra Belaqua, a young girl living among scholars in Oxford's Jordan College. Her world may seem diverse, from physical embodiments of souls that take the shape of an animal, but similar with people around you to become friends and enemies. She is thrown into a perilous adventure when she overhears a conversation of an extraordinary microscopic particle, Dust. This particle is said to unite different worlds, and is feared by many who want to destroy it forever. As Lyra is flung into the middle of this horrible struggle, she meets wondrous creatures both big and small, and villains who are not what they seem. Gobblers, that kidnap children, will turn out in the most unexpected places. And a magical compass of gold that will answer any question if one is skilled enough to read it. Lyra's adventure continues throughout these three books, and the first is about to be told. The only problem that I had with this movie was the Anti-Christian overtones of the Magisterium during the film. I'm not with the Catholic Church, but I agree that the word \"Heresy\" was the only reason why the second and third movies would not be adapted into screen. That's it for my problem. The casting was great and the actors were very decent. Daniel Craig was solid as Lord Asriel despite the fact that he wasn't given enough screentime. Nicole Kidman was decent as Mrs. Coulter, but her hair is very different from the book counterpart as it describes her hair as blond. Ian Mckellen was amazing as the great armoured ice bear (also known as a Pansjorborne) Iorek Byrnison, and Dakota Blue Richards was very convincing and compelling as Lyra when it comes to actresses in movie adaptations and the rest of the actors turned out good. The sets were very creative, but at most times, they were quite dark due to the Svalbard place. The CGI on the animals are very damn impressive. The daemons (just like in the book despite the fact that it was mispronounced) were very visualized and the polar bears are also visualized. The action scenes were very epic and the direction from Chris Wietz was well-paced. The Golden Compass lacks in any depth, but it is a darker, deeper, and fantastic adaptation of Phillip Pullman's greatest fantasy series. 8/10"

I am currently reading the books again because thanks to a group of silly devolved organizations based in the USA, the rest of the story will not be made into film despite the Golden Compass doubling its money at the box office. There is always going to be the book versus the film arguments \"oh, the film is not like the book.\" Perhaps people who say things like that should read a single chapter out loud and time themselves. When they figure out an average chapter will take around 10 - 15 minutes to read properly, then perhaps they will understand a scriptwriters job better. Yes, the film is not like the book, but it has taken the essence of the story and made the Golden Compass into something different from the usual film fare. I very much hope the cowardly filmmakers in Hollywood lift a suitable digit at the silly organizations attempting to censor what the masses can see and hear."

The world that they create has to seem real and completely whole. LOTR accomplished this. This movie does not. The fantasy elements just seem silly and contrived (except for the daemon thing) and are pulled out of the sack whenever it's convenient. Need a deus ex machina--how about an armored bear that suddenly appears out of nowhere? Or a convenient flock of rescue witches? Like the worst of the Harry Potter movies, where a hastily-remembered spell saves the day, resolutions here are never really struggled for. ALSO--what the hell is Sam Eliot doing in this movie with his absurd cowboy twang (has there ever been a more one-trick pony than this guy)? I found myself predicting his lines before he said them, and, again, I never read the books."

Numerous scenes from the book were left out, but then again, it's only natural for a film to do that, due to the limited time frame a movie can hold. What I found the most amusing is the complaints of numerous parents who bring their children (5-11 years old) to watch the movie. From what I can see on their faces, they were appalled at many of the scenes which they redeemed as \"inappropriate (ex: bears lower muzzle gets ripped off).\" However, just as John P. states, this movie is rather for teenagers and adults, and not for kids. Overall, the movie was satisfactory, but only probably due to the fact that I re-read the book to refresh my memory. My friend who never read the book often needed explanations on what was going on... So before watching the movie, people should remember some things: 1. It's not really kid-friendly 2. It's only the first part of a trilogy, so don't be disappointed at the cliff-hanger ending 3. Best to read the book before watching."

It seems the entire movie should be plastered with little notes on the screen saying \"Courtesy of Lord of the Rings\" or \"Inspired by Harry Potter\" and the list goes on. Its desperate reaching to cash in on the success of those series is pathetic. The question one asks throughout the film is \"OK, and why is that interesting, and why should I care?\" None of the characters are intriguing or likable. The plot is fragmented and episodic and lacks any tension. The effects are impressive, but seem sadly wasted on a movie that, above all, is just really, really boring. And the end is the most shameless plea (which should be denied) for a sequel(s) in movie history. Please, spare us."

Arguably, we want to learn more about the dust from one of these parallel universes Lord Asriel(Daniel Craig) prattles on about, but sitting through two more installments of this upstart trilogy(billed as the thinking man's \"Harry Potter\"), methinks is a taxing proposition, because \"The Golden Compass\" lays an egg, and it certainly isn't golden. For starters, a disproportionate amount of time is spent at the university, in which the exposition is laid out to us; at one point, in seminar-like fashion from a lectern. Lyra(Dakota Blue Richards), eventually, like Bilbo Baggins, leaves behind her sheltered existence and accompanies Marisa(Nicole Kidman) to the north as her assistant. That's when \"The Golden Compass\" starts to pay the price for its needless dawdling. Kidman is cheated out of precious screen time as Marisa, or rather Marisa's spirit, makes us wonder what it would be like if Joan Crawford had a monkey(what makes Marisa angry reminded me of the wire hanger scene in \"Mommie Dearest\"). This is where the film loses its footing. There's evidence of heavy editing here. \"The Golden Compass\" should've established Marisa as Lyra's mentor before the girl learns the truth about her duplicitous nature. The movie never truly recovers. This filmmaker is a novice at staging action scenes, and it shows. Kidman is upstaged by a talking polar bear. That's some bear, though."
