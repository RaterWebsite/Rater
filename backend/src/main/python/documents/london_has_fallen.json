It's \"save the president\" themed action movie, sets in London. There are famous names actors to elevate the story, but it should be no surprise that the drama portion is average. They do succeed on advancing the action into full blown combat spectacle from continuous shoot-out and rapid brutal slashing.\r Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart), the president of USA, has an obligation to attend the funeral of British Prime Minister. Along with his trusty bodyguard and soon-to-be part time dad, Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) he embarks in the trip, and as we all know it, London is eventually hit with terrorist attack. The story is plain it operates on a strict linear motion with barely any twist at all even though it has actors who worked on this genre before.\r The main idea is the same patriotism and duty-bound motive, which is arguably worked slightly better than the predecessor, but it often becomes too flat in delivery. Some of the scenes feel too forced to create tension and it ends up too clich\u00e9 in the process. Script doesn't produce any solid interaction as it relies on too much on misguided bravado and the comedy aspect only works partially. Furthermore, the intended twist is far from effective since it doesn't develop nicely, if any at all.\r Fortunately, this is a definite step up action-wise. Chase scenes, melee brawls and gun fights are far more intense and better choreographed. It has the luxury of great continuous shots action in no shortage of speed and impact, almost similar to video game sequences. There's also the addition of CG for large scale attack, understandable since they have to present actual London under siege, though it's inferior to the psychical combat counterpart.\r \"London Has Fallen\" is miles from the predecessor in term of action, but it might not be an appealing visit for those wanting complex narrative."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Another one of the \"terrorist group declares war on the entire world and somehow is more powerful than the rest of the world's army combined\" hollywood film, with zero respect for the viewer's intelligence.

I know this movie isn't suppose to be taken too seriously, because you would look like a right fool if you take any of this movie serious, but i can't pretend or act like i don't see the major flaws in this movie. I think the biggest thing that really hurt this movie is the noticeable CGI, which is absolutely awful and looks completely unfinished. Aaron Eckhart basically plays the male version of a damsel in distress and Jackie Earle Haley doesn't even do anything in this film.\r Overall, if you want a movie that's non-stop action and doesn't make any sense at all, but you want to have a good time, then London Has Fallen is the movie for you."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Great above average action film.

Bad guys, no matter how hard you try to justify them, are always the main concern and heavily scrutinized subject of many critics and talks within action movies. Now, after 2013\u2019s obsession with White House abduction movies, White House Down and the original Olympus Has Fallen, which spawned our currently reviewed London Has Fallen, its hard not to be political when the main players in the film are today\u2019s world leaders.\r In 2013, London\u2019s predecessor Olympus Has Fallen showed a very political situation of a North Korean terrorist trying to unify Korea by capturing the American President, and using it as leverage to remove American opposition in North Korea for a South Korean invasion. While London Has Fallen does not have as much of a very intellectual plot as its original, one thing is for sure, the action, language and kick-ass Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) are amped up to mirror signature John McClane moments, but never ever quite passes them.\r London Has Fallen is a less thought-out actioner, yet, the film tries to out-do its predecessor\u2019s actions, with a smaller budget, which never boasts well for action movies. Usually, when studios give a smaller budget to sequels, their faith in the subject matter is not very convincing. Yet, London Has Fallen is a more aggressive, solid action film that Olympus on many levels, and perhaps thats because of the cast and crew\u2019s fun with the material, rather than a serious tone found in the first film.\r Rugged with grit and braun, London Has Fallen is easily a fun and mindless action movie for die-hard action movie fans, as well as passive fanfare for casual action fans to the genre as well. Filled with ridiculous one-liners, sometimes really animated and disgraceful action special effects and some serious contemplative moments of justification and reveal, London Has Fallen is the perfect post-Oscar action movie to cozy up to for the month of March.\r As mentioned above, Olympus was a much more plot-heavy and politically savvy action film, while London is nothing short of a revenge film. But who is to say revenge films are bad? Anyone remember Kill Bill or Mad Max: Fury Road?\r The baddie this time, Aamir Barkawi (Alon Aboutboul) is a arms-dealing terrorist, arming any nation or any one body, with deep enough pockets, with weapons that could take out some of the world largest and longest standing national landmarks. When his dealings get him directly entangled with the interests of the United States, the United States military orders a drone strike attack on Aamir and his family. Of course, to amp up the melodrama and emotions, despite all of the intelligence of the United States government, the day of the strike is the same day as Aamir\u2019s youngest daughter\u2019s wedding. Barely escaping the bombing of the United States, Aamir and his son Kamran Barkawi (Waleed Zuaiter) spend two long, hard year, devising a plan that will get their revenge and debt in blood.\r Upon the news of the sudden death of the British Prime Minister, President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart) along with his top personal Secret Service Agent Banning, make their way to the UK for a highly publicized funeral for the former Prime Minister. Gathering some of the biggest leaders in the world, Barkawi\u2019s plans being to unfold, trapping leaders, bombing landmarks and killing off thousands of people, including innocent civilians, in an attempt to capturing the leader of the free world, and globally broadcasting his execution. Banning, whose steps ahead of every nations top security outlets, goes above and beyond his duties, not informing a single soul of the President\u2019s movements and plans. His quick decisions saves the President for as long as he can, until he in inevitably captured and planned to be publicly executed for fear propaganda.\r Some of the most interesting parts of London Has Fallen aren\u2019t even within the scenes of the film, but facts surrounding the film as a whole make for one interesting little pop culture entry. Olympus, which was directed by American go-to action director Antoine Fuqua (Southpaw and The Equalizer) dropped out of the sequel, and was replaced, surprisingly by Iranian born filmmaker Babak Najafi, the man behind the Easy Money sequel and Berlin Film Festival darling Sebbe. What\u2019s truly surprising with London is the studio\u2019s confidence in an International director taking the reigns of a quite heavy Pro-America action film, one that has no problem showcasing the always tacky shots of the tattered American flag victoriously whisking in the wind over a sunrise or sunset."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "After watching this based on a recommendation (or at least started to watch and then gave up after 30 or so mins) I can say this is one of the worst movies I've watched in a long time.Filled with horrible plot elements that utterly smash suspension of disbelief and a Pro-US bent so driven that this is comparable to the propaganda films of North Korea.The opening scenes seem written only to directly insult every nation possible.
