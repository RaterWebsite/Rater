You will see no black American in this movie. How do I know that it is deliberate? Remeber the guy at pearl harbor jumping behind the gun and shooting down a Japanese plane? That happened. That's famous because it was done by a black man and he didn't get a medal because of that fact. They made him white like every other american soldier in this movie."

It\u2019s definitely one of his better films but that isn\u2019t saying a lot. This has to be one of the worst scripts of the year. Every single line of dialogue was awful and insufferable. It was obvious that all the film cared about was its visual effects instead of its script and characters. Even though the characters are based on real people, they still feel very bland and boring. I don\u2019t know why they put Nick Jonas in this movie other than to just have him in the film. The acting from most of them isn\u2019t half bad. They are trying their hardest with the material they are given and do a good job for what the film is going for. Aaron Eckhart for his limited screen time probably gives the best performance of the entire film. Ed Skrein does a pretty terrible American accent though. There were aspects to the presentation of the film I did appreciate. Before I saw the film, I did some research on the Battle of Midway and the film was actually very historically accurate. The dive bombers did miss a lot of shots and maybe only one or two would manage to land a hit on the Japanese carriers. While some may call that cheesy within the film, it was historically accurate. I also like how the film didn\u2019t demonize the Japanese unlike a certain 2001 film (Pearl Harbor). It shows them as human too and that they were doing what they had to do to protect themselves and to follow orders. The action scenes weren\u2019t half bad but mostly forgettable although some scenes did look really cool. The visual effects weren\u2019t that bad either. They were pretty meh in the beginning but they got better as the film went along. Another thing I will give the film credit for was that it was for the most part entertaining. I didn\u2019t ever feel bored even with the 2 and a half hour runtime but that might be an issue for some. The music sounded like stock war film music and there was a large amount of war film cliches thrown into the film which were very obnoxious. Some scenes are loud enough where some actors have to overdub their voices but it wasn\u2019t properly synced up at some points which took me out of the film a little. Overall, Midway may be entertaining and very historically accurate but it falls victim to an awful script, bland characters, and too many typical war film cliches."

      "text": "Unfortunately, Midway plays like a disjointed, star studded documentary than a coherent movie. The one thing you will notice right away is how much the movie jumps around, and if you don't pay attention, you'll get confused since we are jumping forward in time and in between places frequently and without much warning. Then we have some side plots that go nowhere. This movie could do without the whole Doolittle raid, the submarine, and the director trying to make a movie on midway. It feels like they are trying to fit in as many tidbits of historical info as they can. Instead, it could focus a bit more on midway and everyone stationed there(for a movie about midway, there is awfully little of it) and have more focus on the operation. As it stands there is no build up and you can't definitely tell when the time for the attack has come. To be frank this movie is not that historically accurate either.One other thing is the CGI. At best it looks like the best from a video game cinematic, at worse it looks like some cable channel's documentary.About the acting I think it was ok, the actors gave their best. But they weren't given much time or space to breat as the movie just jumped around constantly.Overall I thing it's a passable, albeit mediocre film."

The lead in where they discuss tactics from tora tora tora is missing and there are certain segments of the battle which are missing.  The battle is much more entertaining if you explains all the tactics used and the decisions the admirals had to make on the spot.  They should have started the movie after pearl harbor and followed the two pilots that had two hits each, that should have been the movie.  They extended the movie by having pearl harbor and then added even more subplots which weren't relevant. I would just have focused on the intelligence breakthrough and the actions on the deck of each admiral, plus follow a few pilots."

I read about the so called lines of dialog being somehow not to 2019 standards but did anyone ever stop to think that is how people may have talked back then. The special effects were top notch and the only fault I could find was that it was not detailed enough but I could understand as this movie covered all the battles between the start of the war, Pearl Harbor, Doolittles Raid, Coral Sea and Midway. Each could have been a movie unto itself. Best war picture I have seen in years!"

In an attempt to add a human slant to this battle-chocked war movie, the story is populated stories of several actual heroes. Director Roland Emmerich is known for his big disaster flix and this one has plenty of firepower\u2026however, the CGI isn't always convincing. Despite all of the action, much of the drama feels like a throwback to 50s war movies replete with corny dialogue and bad acting.

      "text": "If Michael Bay's 'Pearl Harbor' (2001) was too pretentiously romantic and historically inaccurate for you, the best thing I can say about Roland Emmerich's 'Midway' is that, it does take a more accurate look on the attacks on Pearl Harbor, but everything else about this film makes me wish it was handled by a different filmmaker. The film stars Ed Skrein as Lieutenant Richard Best, and his journey through this picture in becoming a daring pilot to save the Americans from the Japanese attack. Skrein is a good actor, whose had many different and successful roles, but here, his accent feels too fake and put-on, it also doesn't help that the dialogue, which was given to him by Wes Tooke, wants him to ham-up the cliched hero talk and over-exaggerate everything he says. He lives a rather peaceful life with his wife Anne (Mandy Moore) and daughter. The film is 2 hours and 18 minutes long, and I can definitely confirm that the pace of the film makes you feel every minute that goes by. There are so many characters here to focus on who don't get as many pivotal moments until the movie ends. We have Lieutenant Commander Edwin Layton (Patrick Wilson) who tries his best to figure out a way that the Americans can defeat Japan and prevent more lives at risk. The battle sequences are fine, but the main issue I took with this film is the very bright color palette. There is a lot of yellow here that is being emphasized on screen. The picture doesn't feel gritty or at least horrifying when you take into account what the characters have to go through here. Plus, the film is PG-13, which is the same mistake made with 'Pearl Harbor' (2001), there is no sense of horror or disturbance. Many of the deaths you see on screen won't stick with you, at least not in the way Steven Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan' (1998) did. I understand it's unfair to compare 'Midway' or any other war film to 'Saving Private Ryan' (1998), but if you want to make an effective war film, that's how it's done. Or at least, try to find other reasons why that worked. Overall, this is a forgettable movie filled with over-the-top and clustered action, some hammy acting and crummy dialogue. I think it's safe to say that the legacy of the people we see here will only be seen through the history books."

What was \"mentioned\" is accurate enough, but blatantly exclusive to the Enterprise CV6, to the exclusion of practically every other American Carrier in the Pacific 1942.  Lexington (mentioned once), Yorktown (mentioned twice), Hornet (mentioned once).  Good coverage of attack on Pearl Harbor (Dec 1941).  Good coverage on Doolittle raid (Enterprise and Hornet Apr 1942).  Decent coverage of Gilbert Raid (Enterprise May 1942).  No mention of Solomon Raids (Yorktown May 1942).  Piss poor coverage on Battle of Coral Sea (They show a glimpse of Lexington being lost, NEVER mention the Yorktown, but boy they make mention of the Enterprise and how it almost got there....  As for the battle of Midway, Yorktown is only mentioned twice (as being repaired at Pearl Harbor, and then being lost at end of Midway), and the Hornet is never mentioned at all. They cover Admiral Halsey getting sick prior to Midway, cover Admiral Spruance being put in charge of TF-16, and never mention once Admiral Fletcher (TF-17 / Yorktown) being in Tactical command of all American effort at Midway.Again, the movie needs to be retitled \"Enterprise CV-6\"."

The first 25 minutes of Pearl Harbour attack could be just the best part this film has to offer with well-paced action sequences and dialogue. The rest is purely bits and pieces of dramatic and repetitive battles with some subplots added into the mix to prove the heroic and unbelievable choices that Navy pilots make. The Aaron Eckhart's subplot is even more ridculous, following his journey into China then nowhere to be seen till the very end of the film. With so many lazy and fast-jumping edits, Emmerich loses traction in the later part of the film, giving the audience little to none of the anticipation that the Pearl Harbour Attack built up."

The main character has a very funky accent (after researching it seems he's British- why couldnt they have hired an American actor instead?), and his scenes are very awkward and distracting. In fact the non-battle sequences are devoid of any drama and characterization that its all laughable.The characters are all archetypes, and dont seem to be very realistic even though they are based on real life people. The script has no suspense or thrills- it seems more like a highlight reel of what happened on Pearl Harbor to the Battle of Midway. Even the Doolittle Raid takes up about five minutes- I think they included it because half the backers of this movie are Chinese. Let's not forget the cringe worthy dialogue too.The original Charlton Heston movie was better- if it only had better special effects like this one it would have been a classic."

      "text": "For a movie with a lot of action, I was a little bored.This is helmed by disaster movie director Roland Emmerich. He is a guy who found his voice in the 90's, and this movie kind of feels like it was made during that decade. The execution is too light for its own good. I don't mean this in a complimentary way. Dialogue is undercooked and at times cliched. I felt like a lot of good actors were wasted here. There is a lot of quick jumping from scene-to-scene. Yes, I know this is one of those war movies that look at many players, but even by the standards of these types of films, the scenes often don't hold weight.Also, this movie feels kind of odd for today. More recent war movies have tried to look at the more realistic and darker elements of the subject and the human toll and psychology of it all. Not that this movie isn't about human sacrifice, but this tries to be more of a crowdpleaser like the war films of yesteryear. It feels out of place in today's climate.    Of course, I could just be jaded. If you want to see movie honoring those who died for our county, then this might be for you. The movie does a good job of laying out how the battle of Midway went down on both the American and Japanese fronts and evoking the old feel of wide-scale military battle films. Emmerich maintains his eye for action. The combat scenes are all done well. The computer graphics aren't the best; none of them look realistic enough. In Emmerich's defense, I give him credit for showing a lot of them during full daylight scenes, which is trickier than doing them during night or in grey/blue lighting. Also, props to hair and costumes in this. Overall, this is a movie that looks good enough but just doesn't stand out."

And failed utterly.  The flight scenes were right out of video games, but the ones that don't bear any relation to the physics of flight.

It tries to resemble old glories and strives to give the spectator a good representation of the historical facts that happened before the Battle of Midway.It is certainly BETTER than Pearl Harbor, but it's sluggish on most of the scenes before the actual battle. There are many characters involved so you have to keep your attention up and running, especially if you are not a history buff or you do not know what happened in the Battle itself.The air battles are good, but sometimes, especially in the Pearl Harbor introduction, feel ARCADEISH and GAMEY. But the graphical representation of a task force at sea seems to be taken directly from photographs of the era.Dive bombing attacks are done really well but exaggerated in some points due to drama and script requests.Midway, in the end, is a DECENT war movie, it has the taste of old glories with a side of modern quirks. Does this save the movie ?Nope. But it's 'fun'. Definitely not for the historical buff, but it's ok."

But to me I enjoyed it and I thought it was nice it also showed Japanese side too. Maybe only minus it tried to show most of the characters involved and didn't show too much of just one to get too emotionally attached? besides that all was nice"
