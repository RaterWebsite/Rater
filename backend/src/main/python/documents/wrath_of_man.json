It's incredibly well plotted and amazingly no other reviewer has pointed out the numerous nods to Michael Mann's Heat (1992) and his camera work.Definitely worth checking out- its a satisfying tale, although a little implausible in the era of near-cashless society."

Gritty, dark and violent, with a very satisfying narrative arc ~ it\u2019s a man\u2019s movie, like something Eastwood would make in the 70s, not everyone\u2019s cup of tea but much better than I was expecting, and I was expecting a lot from the always improving Guy Richie and the great Jason Statham ~ who has become one of the biggest movie stars in the world right now. Everything about this movie was high brow and stylish ~ it felt like a GTA heist mission written by Paul Shrader and directed by Martin Scorsese. The lighting, camera movements, soundtrack, casting, plot twists, fire fights ~ the whole production values were A1 and the plot felt cohesive and felt all very grown up. Loved it. Bravo to all involved."

Jason Statham isn\u2019t in kick-butt action mode here - it is more about gun fights. Statham is Statham. The rest of the performances are great. Good to see Josh Hartnett in this sort of film. The movie Wrath of Man most reminded me of is Den of Thieves. It is not as clever in its twists and turns as that movie but if you want some good action you could do a lot worse. Recommended."

      "text": "Director Guy Ritchie has crafted some of the best hybrids of Action and Caper films in cinematic history with \u201cSnatch\u201d and \u201cLock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\u201d. His latest film \u201cWrath of Man\u201d for which he also helped write; focuses on a man named H (Jason Statham) who is given the unique moniker by his trainer when he is hired to work for an Armored Transport company.The Soft-Spoken H barely qualifies for his job based on his assessment testing, but when his shipment is hit during his initial run; he shows uncanny skills and deadly precision as he eliminated the robbers.While this makes him a hero at work; there are those who think he actually enjoys it and is hiding something.The film cleverly jumps a few months ahead and then backward before resuming the story as we learn more about H\u2019s past and how he earned those skills and what is motivating the darkness inside him to strike back at all attempted robberies of his shipments with extreme prejudice.This all leads to an interesting confrontation as various elements and factions converge to make for a complicated but action-filled finale.The film is actually lighter on action than I expected as while there is a good amount of it at times, it is spaced out, and do not expect to see Statham using the fighting skills he has shown in \u201cThe Expendables:\u201d \u201cCrank\u201d and \u201cTransporter\u201d series as he is happy to let his guns do the bulk of his action sequences.The film does drag in places as while it has a solid supporting cast with Scott Eastwood, Josh Hartnett, and others, cast members such as Andy Garcia barely appear in the film, and elements of his relationship with H are missing.H has an interesting backstory but it is never fully developed in a way that gives the audience a satisfying explanation. We know elements of who he was and why he is doing things but there are deeper questions that are left unanswered.I also kept waiting for a big twist or the trademark humor that is associated with many of Ritchie\u2019s films which I believe was needed to fully round out this film.I can overlook some leaps of logic during the finale and at various points as those are necessary to make films of this type of work, but some of them just seemed like taking the easy way out and not offering even a rudimentary explanation.In the end \u201cWrath of Man\u201d lacks the sustained action that fans may expect as well as the complex and gripping plots that are the hallmark of good drama.The film is an at times entertaining hybrid that does some things very well; just not enough of them to really make this one stand out.3.5 stars out of 5.Skewed and Reviewed"

Jason Statham gives a good performance as always, quiet and composed he portrays his character excellently. Like any Guy Ritchie film, it has a nicely crafted script and keeps you guessing through the movie, it has a good pay off at the end. One of the best films I've seen this year and more entertaining than most of the mindless popcorn flicks that Hollywood churn out."

The characters are fully aware they aren't all going to make it out, but they forget that if even one of them is identified the entire group is going down. These characters are shown to be family men, and are supposedly doing this for them, yet they almost go into this as a suicide mission.That's where it's stuck with me. Not really (actively) rewatchable with this, to me, glaring plothole."

More concerning is the fact that reviews are faked on many sites; the movie they are discussing is not even this movie. Where there is bots posting reviews there is a trail of money. Someone knew this movie would tank and is proping up its corpse. Only good thing about this movie was seeing the naked miner from the Chernobyl series only problem was here he was playing an office worker and he had all his clothes on.

      "text": "This is the first time that Jason Statham and director Guy Ritchie have teamed up since their series of edgy films in the early 2000s. Sadly, this outing has less of the snap and sass as their earlier collabs. Statham plays his typical stern silent type, who\u2019s hired as a security guard for a cash transportation company. Of course, he shocks everyone (but the audience) when his truck is hijacked and he quickly dispatches the crooks. As expected, his real identity surfaces and things get complicated\u2026but not very interesting. There\u2019s an elaborate heist that forms the crux of the last act, but it\u2019s not especially original. Ultimately, a film like this is about the action and this one is unimpressive. Ritchie\u2019s typical sharp dialogue, snappy editing and frenetic violence are in short supply, leaving a bland caper flick with lots of noisy gun fights and a lackluster Statham."

Directed by Guy Ritchie (who also directed Statham in 'Snatch' and 'Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels'), the film pretty much delivers what anybody familiar with Statham would expect from one of his action flicks, for better or worse. In my case, I found the story rather convoluted, confusing, and hard to follow often times, and even during moments where that wasn't the case, the film was too busy being predictable. The film's beats always felt too familiar, with only a few moments of genuine thrill or unexpected turns to be found. Statham commits himself like always to this kind of role, but he's really just playing himself here again. Overall, some exciting shootouts can't fully make up for a predictable but also confusing and scattered storyline."

The story actually starts jumping from the present to the past, where the past goes to the future, but still not to the present, until in the finale we get to the present again and I just believe I've already messed with your brain with this one. It probably doesn't even make much sense, and I apologize for that. I just want to say that it jumped around a bit too much here and there in different storylines in my opinion. I'm not saying the movie didn't make sense or anything. This is purely my opinion and my problem that I couldn't get my bearings a little bit here and there. The pacing also fluctuated quite a bit and not much happened for quite some time, but the ending made up for it with some awesome action. As for the story, it's good, just as I mentioned a bit worse timed. To sum it all up. The Angry Man is a good film for me to recommend. It kind of sounds like I'm bashing it here, but I'm not. I'm just mentioning here the biggest problem I had with the film. Otherwise, I was satisfied in the final analysis."

It tries desperately to be Heat, but the gunplay and heist planning and characterization doesn't square up. Instead it winds up being more like Taken, with a better protagonist but just as ludicrous in the end -- actually, worse than Taken in some regards, because the ending isn't as satisfying."

      "text": "Wrath of Man is disappointing. It introduces an interesting plot with great music and cool camera shots but is never interesting or action packed enough to keep you from being bored. The first 30 minutes are enjoyable but then it goes into flashbacks for 45 minutes and introduces a completely different set of characters just to tie the story together. The flashbacks over complicate the story to the point that you lose interest. The flashbacks drag with the scenes lasting too long and not really adding much to the movie. In the last 30 minutes it all comes together with a climax that never really has enough tension and mediocre action sequences. I feel like this movie could\u2019ve been better if it was just a fun stupid action thriller about cash trucks or telling the story without spending so long on a random group of characters and tedious flashbacks. I was very excited for this movie but Ritchie\u2019s direction really didn\u2019t serve the concept as well as I hoped."
