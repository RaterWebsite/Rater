      "text": "Takes inventory of everything that worked about its predecessor and doubles down, whilst also looking to patch up the things that didn't quite come across as well as they could have -- just as every sequel should. \"For A Few Dollars More\" elevates the Dollars trilogy with much more likable leads, a surplus of action to savor, and a score that -- I swear to God -- has at least three or four themes that'll turn into genuine earworms for you in the days following your viewing of the flick. Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef are a joy to watch onscreen, with their friendship ultimately providing the most satisfying element of the entire experience (especially once the ending comes around). Major props also go to Gian Maria Volonte for bringing the dastardly, yet tortured spirit of \"el Indio\" into the fold and then some. You can see a lot of \"Once Upon A Time In The West\" in this, both thematically and narratively. And even though it's not as filmically brilliant as that film, it definitely ages better (subtextually speaking) and is simply more efficient overall. Great film."

      "text": "Just for the record I happen to love all three films. For a Few Dollard More is an amazing film though perhaps not as influential as The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. There is one improvement over that film though, and that is the writing of Clint Eastwood's character, more developed and more compelling. A Fistful of Dollars is also great because of everything that makes TGTBATU and FAFDM so good, but I do consider the other two more influential on the genre and also Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo, which used the film as its inspiration, to be the superior film. Back to A Few Dollars More, the stylised visuals are stunning to look at, the scenery is the very definition of epic and the cinematography sweeps. Ennio Morricone's score is both elegiac and operatic in tone and the story of greed and revenge that focuses mainly on the pursuit of bandit Indio draws you right in and never lets go. The dialogue is peppered with grit and dark humour, which is well-balanced with neither over-powering the other, while Leone's direction is superb. Clint Eastwood plays his more developed character with immense charisma, Lee Van Cleef is suitably vengeful and again Gian Maria Volonte snarls convincingly. Overall, a wonderful film. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

      "text": "To consider this one of the rare sequels that improves upon their predecessors would be an understatement. With a taut screenplay, tight editing, impressive camera work, Superb cinematography with beautifully framed shots, Morricone's atmospheric and slow-burning score, a nuanced direction and an unmatched chemistry between Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef, one of the most intimidating villains in a Western, I wouldn't be exaggerating if I said that For a Few Dollars More is about on par with Leone's masterpiece The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. The latter is still my favourite of his, but I really think For a Few Dollars More has a more daring, challenging and unpredictable script! The complaint I have is that the first act is a bit too cheesy unlike the rest of the film. Hence, there is kind of a jarring tonal shift between the first and the second act.(9/10)"

Voc\u00ea arrepia, entra no clima, e o suspense chega ao n\u00edvel m\u00e1ximo. Os personagens s\u00e3o ainda melhores, e o destaque dado ao Coronel funcionou muito bem. Junto com todo plot envolvendo o \u00cdndio e ele. Inclusive, plot esse que aumenta muito a propor\u00e7\u00e3o das coisas.A fotografia est\u00e1 excelente, com uns planos que chegam a encher os olhos. Algumas cenas s\u00e3o memor\u00e1veis, como o encontro entre o Coronel e Monco - N\u00e3o posso deixar de mencion\u00e1-la. A atua\u00e7\u00e3o de forma geral est\u00e1 muito boa, junto com os efeitos pr\u00e1ticos utilizados. O enredo \u00e9 muito chamativo e cheio de revira voltas que n\u00e3o deixam que a obra caia em monotonismo, fora o desenvolvimento de personagem que est\u00e1 \u00f3timo.Por fim, deixo aqui minha recomenda\u00e7\u00e3o. Esse filme \u00e9 essencial para quem \u00e9 amante da s\u00e9tima arte."

      "text": "This film contains more of the same from the mysterious man - I love me some C. Easwood - mean and moody etc. There's something charming about the budget English dubbing (from the original Italian, I believe) and (if anythng moreso) the instrumental, sometimes quite high pitched music played in the background. It is quite atmospheric and I enjoyed the battle or confrontation scenes. I think I liked that there are a number of young children and babies present in various scenes featuring the local villagers, giving an extra sense of urgency and fragility in terms of the innocents caught in the cross fires.I'm not sure I'd say its as good as the original 'Fistful of Dollars' film but its still a decent watch and I'd recommend it on that basis."

Also, I bloody love everything in this movie, the plot, the characters, the dialogue, the gun fights, the composers theme which is used throughout this movie and Clint Eastwood being a bad ass throughout. Overall, it's an amazing Spaghetti Western movie with lots of action and lots of good moments throughout. I'd recommend for you to watch this after you've watched A Fistful Of Dollars, that's also really good but I prefer this one a little bit more but yeah, it's honestly worth the watch."
