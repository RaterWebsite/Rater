They can't change history, but they can change what happens and has happened in their own lives. Thus begins the start of a lesson in learning to appreciate life itself as it is, as it comes, and most importantly, the people living alongside us.",

Even the first 30 minutes is pretty cheesey in nature as well-predictable and a story that has already been told. But the story turns to a more family oriented,family saving ordeal with feeling in that the viewer can identify with the predictament the family begins to face.

The movie wants to tell you that what's really important is seeking time travel method and use it in genius way, but manage your own given time well and enjoy your present."

So far they all love it to (and say \"why have I not heard of this movie?\") The low ratings by critics are very disappointing. All I can imagine is that they must be judging that it doesn't fit perfectly into the film structure they were taught in film school, and even more importantly, they distrust movies that make them feel. The film is a bit like \"Groundhog Day\" in a number of ways, but \"About Time\" much more deeply involved in relationships where \"Groundhog Day\" is completely centered around one character who only manages a relationship at the end."

Rachel McAdams delivers a cute performance, while Bill Nighy shines as the zealous and gentle father of the male protagonist. Even the then rookie Margot Robbie delivers a precise performance, although the character appears little and does not require much development. The soundtrack is flawless."

It's true, everyone would wish to have Tim's gift, and the flaws in the time travel rules explained throughout the film didn't actually bother me at all. It's not a film about time travel at all, it's just a romantic comedy where a man has the chance to do things over and over till they're the way he wants them.\r Stupefied by the fact that Rachel McAdams would take on a role in \"Time Traveller's Wife\" and then in \"About Time\", but whatever works for her. Bill Nighy is spectacular as always. Gleeson is not much but he's supposed to be the average man so that kind of fits.\r Rom-com with no dentist required, it's okay. And Uncle Desmond's character is brilliant."

      "text": "In regards to the film \u201cAbout Time\u201d...\r In this age of out-of-this-world ridiculous visual effects, computer graphics, action stunts and massive Hollywood blockbuster productions worth hundreds of millions of dollars, we get this subtle little film \u201cAbout Time\u201d, which offers us the complete opposite of what we, as an audience, have come to expect from Hollywood to entertain us. The film is exquisitely scripted, backed by tremendous performances by the actors, especially by Bill Nighy, and most of all, the film gives us a dose of deep, meaningful emotional roller coaster.\rAt the beginning, we find that the central character\u2019s family has a deep secret: the men of that family are able to travel back in time. This makes one skeptical of the entire movie: haven\u2019t we already had a story like this before? From this point on, it seems as though the plot and the dialogue of the rest of the film are like a subtle closing argument as to why that time travel aspect is not really an important aspect of the film, although it does affect the story.\rAnother misconception of this film is that while it seems like a story of a man and a woman falling in love, it really is about the relationship between a father and a son. Their storyline pretty much outclasses and overshadows every other storyline of the film. From that prior skepticism when we first hear about the time travelling ability, as the story unfolds and the plot thickens, the audience becomes emotionally manhandled. Why? Because of love.\rWe see the chase for love, the choices that are made for and because of love, the consequences of love, and finally, the hardest part for us humans when we deal with love: knowing when to let go and have the courage to move on after losing love. That skepticism that I mentioned about at the beginning of the film? It dramatically changes into support, with the audience longing for the son to use his abilities more and more. You can sense, hear and feel the emotional wreckage going on in the theater, not because of the romance between a husband and wife, but because, for most of us, we don\u2019t have that loving relationship depicted here between father and son.\rThis movie couldn\u2019t have come to Korea at a better time. With Christmas almost here, it\u2019s almost as though this film has come to remind us that with the time we have, maybe we need to focus on what is really important to us. Even in a materialistic society like Korea, maybe this movie can remind us and help us move in the right direction little by little."

It\u2019s a shame it had to sell the love story part in its promotion to get people watching this movie.\r The directing and the cinematography is absolutely beautiful. In terms of directing, this is a wonderful swan song for Richard Curtis\u2019 directing career.\r However, the story lacked strong conflict. The love story in this movie did not have any conflict at all. It seemed like it\u2019s too much of a perfect romantic story, which felt unrealistic.\r And the plot holes in this story is very noticeable. To get my point, I had to list down the time traveling rules, applied in the movie.\r 1-)Only male members of the family can travel in time.: This rule was broken when Tim traveled way back in time from the beginning of the movie with his sister, Kit Kat. The question why Kit Kat was allowed to time travel as long as she is with her brother is not answered.\r2-)Only travel to the past is possible: This rule was broken when Tim arrives in the past and then goes back to the present time. The question why Tim cannot go to the future, but can go back to the present is not answered.\r3-)It is impossible to go back in time before you were born: The first rule that wasn\u2019t broken.\r4-)Traveling back to a time before your child is born will cause a different child to be born and the original child will be lost: And the last rule that wasn\u2019t broken either.\r With these plot holes and the story lacking conflict makes the movie a bit boring to watch.\r The humor, however, saved the movie. It was funny and smartly written.\r While this time traveling romantic-comedy movie is not memorable, its humor, charm and beautiful setting will remain you to watch the movie until the credits roll."

      "text": "About Time is a charming, utterly tender tale of life, love and the extraordinary of the ordinary. Much like the narrative of the film, Tim travels to the past and back to the present to perfect all the imperfections of his life, yet the film is anything but perfect, and that\u2019s ok. Suffering from inconsistent plot-points to breaking the rules that the film outlines, About Time is surely not a tightly-constricted narrative leap for the genre by any means. Regardless, the film casts an enchanting spell that not only lifts one\u2019s spirit, but causes you to merely forget about the rules Curtis makes, and breaks.\r Writer/director Richard Curtis has had quite a bit of luck in the romantic-comedy genre, making major waves penning Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary, Love Actually, Notting Hill and Four Weddings and a Funeral. Although he has stated that About Time will be his final directorial venture, only behind the aforementioned Love Actually and Pirate Radio, Curtis has succeeded well beyond many of the directors and screenwriters who hoped to successfully recreate anything Nicholas Sparks\u2018 has made, with the exception of The Notebook, of course. Fresh, spontaneous and demanding emotions, Curtis has brought new light to the British romantic-comedy front and has made the kind of films one isn\u2019t ashamed to laugh and cry at.\r Once Tim finally meets Mary (Rachael McAdams), Tim knows he has found the reason to adequately use his time-traveling powers. At first glance, Gleeson and McAdams seem like a poor physical match for a film that at times could be distracting or awkward. Instead, much to the extent and reality in life, the two feed off one another\u2019s unique characteristics splendidly. Tall, pale and with a hint of orange hair, Gleeson\u2018s unqiue on-screen charm is brashly alluring. McAdams on the other hand, stripped of all glam and instead substituted with a rather rag/tag girl-next door look, reminds us why she is cast in these roles and how easy it is to fall in love with her  quirks and all.\r McAdams, who is no stranger to the time-traveling love story narrative, venturing in her third quest as the desired love interest, first inThe Time Traveler\u2019s Wife and two years later in Woody Allen\u2019s acclaimed Midnight In Paris, enchants and reminds us just how adorable and likable she really is in these roles. Bringing a believable essence to the role of Mary, McAdams just may cement herself in time as the go-to, romantic-comedy poster girl.\r As a love story, About Time succeeds. As a tale of morality, a lesson on making each day your last and as a film about the bond between father and son, the film triumphs. Gleeson and Nighy share some of the most sentimental and heart-wrenching moments of the film that are sure to get your eyeballs sweating with joy. Incandescent as father and son, the two actors shine as the heart and soul of the film.\r As the pendulum swings closer to the end of the year, About Time will surely be atop my list of guilty cinematic pleasures of 2013, especially since I am such a sucker for hopeless romantic love stories with an underlining patriarchal theme. About Time may be a highly decorated cautionary tale of the beautiful moments in everyone\u2019s seemingly mundane life and the short time we have to live it, but the film, whether romantically tied or generationally suggestive, is a movie about appreciating the little things. \u201cSome days you want to re-live forever. Some days you want to live once\u201d, and Richard Curtis and company really hammer that notion home with their newest film. Essentially, About Time is really all ABOUT LOVE, and we are alright with that."

In the course of this too long movie, he uses his power to create the perfect relationship with lovely Rachel McAdams. While the plot presents an interesting premise, writer/director Richard Curtis (Notting Hill, Four Weddings and a Funeral) exhibits none of the skills that made these other efforts such a delight. The dialogue lacks spark, the \"quirky\" supporting characters are not and Gleeson doesn't have the comic chops or romantic charms to carry the load.

The only \"tear jerking\" that happens is because of the sappy music and the marriage and baby stuff that some women love to fawn over despite the lack of connection to any of the characters in the film.\r It drags on especially toward the end for no real apparent reason other than to add to the sap appeal for the characters that we have no connection whatsoever to because, again, none was ever developed.\r The reviews promised a chick flick that men could actually enjoy. It did not deliver whatsoever. I can't see anyone with taste enjoying this film.\r Rated 2 because the first 20 minutes were somewhat interesting.\r The only people who could enjoy this film past the 20 minute mark are, to put it bluntly, airhead girls and eunuchs."

Curtis paints an idealised London of lawyers, playwrights, art galleries and vintage fashion. In the midst of it all is aspiring young lawyer Tim (Domhnall Gleeson), who arrives in the capital with new ambition, and a new ability.\r For Tim has just been told the family secret by his father (Bill Nighy). He, along with all the other men in his family, is a time traveller, and can rewrite his own history by travelling back to any point along his own timeline (but no killing Hitler). Nighy\u2019s matter-of-fact exposition on this matter starts the film; along with Tim\u2019s natural incredulity, it is a comic highlight.\r But this is a Richard Curtis project, and Tim\u2019s future is not a chronicle of epic destiny, but a chance for him to finally meet the girl of his dreams. She arrives swiftly in the form of the expatriated Mary (Rachel McAdams).\r Gleeson shines as an atypical leading man, red haired, slightly gangly; at once identifiable and appealing to the audience. McAdams is pleasant, but her character is given little to do. Notably, she never discovers Tim\u2019s big secret.\r Much of the humour comes from Tim\u2019s courtship of Mary, during which he repeats awkward encounters and must meet her for the first time more than once (including a memorable date in London\u2019s famously pitch-black Dans le Noir restaurant, a nifty cinematic experiment).\r The approach is reminiscent of that other great time travelling romantic comedy, the thoroughly brilliant Groundhog Day (1993). But Tim has a blessing, not a curse, and with complete control over his path, approaches with less cynicism and more \u201cLet\u2019s try that again, shall we?\u201d\r So the blend of time travel with a romantic comedy is not entirely original. There is also an inevitable comparison with The Time Traveller\u2019s Wife (2009), which also starred Rachel McAdams. Maybe she\u2019s stuck in a time loop herself.\r As for specifics, the film directly asks you not to question it too much. \u201cWe don\u2019t seem to have destroyed civilisation yet\u201d says Nighy. Some rules rear their head as the narrative progresses, but it\u2019s hard to know what the boundaries actually are, and I just watched Primer (2004).\r This is not a film about time travel, but a romantic comedy in which time travel furthers the plot. But it is about time: how we choose to spend it, and who we choose to spend it with. And while it\u2019s a romance on the face of things, the more interesting relationship, and certainly the more poignant, is between Tim and his father.\r At times, it\u2019s unashamedly sentimental. The entire film has a softness to it that makes you wonder if Curtis smeared Vaseline on the lens. Curtis even manages to turn a potentially day ruining downpour into a fresh and glorious celebration.\r The strength of the writing is in the ability to remain unexpected, and some of this is naturally due to the ability of time travel to allow unexpected things to happen. Conflict appears in unlikely places, and least of all in the relationship between Gleeson and McAdams.\r It\u2019s not perfect, but for all the derivative and saccharine elements, the central father-son relationship is eloquent, and something rarely explored in this way, especially with this level of British reserve. Though the script is witty, it is only peppered with outright comedy (this is still gold, from the versatile Tom Hollander, fantastic as a jaded slovenly playwright, to Tim\u2019s swift cycle through a series of potential best men, complete with appropriate speeches).\r Being relatively unfamiliar with his previous works (aside from classic television shows Blackadder and The Vicar of Dibley) About Time has at the very least inspired me to investigate Richard Curtis\u2019s other films, which are apparently much stronger."

And then along comes pure entertainment, wrapped in a neat little packaged called ABOUT TIME.  If I don't nod off during the first quarter of the film - if I am totally engaged - laughing out loud all by myself -- weeping a few tears of joy at perfect moments in the film -- then I will be happy and feel that it was money well spent.  I rarely urge others to see a film because we all have different tastes.  My taste is:  if I am entertained, made to feel good, and if I watch the credits rise up on the screen with a feeling of having been totally whisked away to a better world -- then I am happy.  Forget American Hustle,  forget Django Unchained;  come away with a good taste in your mouth for once and watch ABOUT TIME.  Well done!"

How refreshing to watch a movie that doesn't leave you in the doldrums.   We liked it so much we invited our friends to watch it with us again.  They loved it, too.  I would like to see more movies like this produced.  We are tired of the violence, ugliness, and darkness of most movies produced today."

A main character who is a boy lives in a small town has a terrific magic. The magic is a skill of time traveling. After his father told him they have a skill of it, the boy always travels time whenever he wants. The boy wants to meet a true love. Then one day, he met an attractive girl at a bar. They fall in each other in first sight. They loved truly and got married. The whole story is about like this. I feel really cozy while watching the movie. The movie gave me a kind of tip to find a good partner. Before I watch the movie, I thought the only thing important of my lifetime companion is apperance. However, I\u3000realized that the more important than appearance is inner side beauty. In these sense, \u201cAbout Time\u201c is didactic movie for people who fine their lover."

It's sweet, full of cute chats, and natural laughs. The movie nailed to make me falls in love with the man character. But, the ending, was easily to forget. So, the whole movie made me remember all of them, but when people asked me of the ending, I bet I'll answer, \"What ending?\"\r They shouldn't end it. I refuse the ending of this movie."

I was very interested in Tim's trek through life with the ability to travel in time, but it is also not perfect. He still had to deal with hardships over his life. Its the perfect mix of romance comedy and drama. I really enjoyed Bill Nighy in the role of the father in the movie."
