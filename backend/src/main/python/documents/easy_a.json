Uhm, folks... It's a MOVIE. Unless you want a movie to be 5 hours long, you have to lay down SOME governing assumptions and hyperbolic situations. Was \"Seinfeld\" a bad TV show because many of the comedic situations were completely contrived?\r The truth is as follows: \"Easy A\" is a funny, entertaining, largely SATIRICAL movie. Olive (Emma Stone) is the dynamic character with a real struggle. The actors that play her friends, her enemies, her parents, her teachers, etc... are supporting cast members that INTENTIONALLY fall into unfair stereotypes...\r Clearly, some people need a lesson in satire. Go see Easy A if you actually have a sense of humor."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Pinpointing the exact moment where Julia Roberts became a star in Garry Marshall's \"Pretty Woman\" was a tangible instant, a light source, previously unseen, suddenly emanating from the jacuzzi. It was Julia singing \"Kiss\", out of tune and out to charm, punctuated with kissing noises, that set the Steel Magnolia apart from the other Magnolias and Mystics. Emma Stone, last seen in \"Zombieland\", now seen in \"Easy A\", has a moment like that, when the earworm(Natasha Bedington's \"Pocketful of Sunshine\") which enters Olive's head, slowly and surely burrows deeper and deeper over the course of a lonely weekend, with perfect editing, Wes Anderson-like titles, and the right shaggy mutt, shows how singing some disposable, yet insinuatingly catchy pop song can turn into a compulsion, a temporary full-blown neurosis, and a cure for the blues, while, of course, charming the pants off the audience. Stone plays a virgin, Olive Pendergast, who is made to feel inadequate by the sexual exploits of her worldly best friend Rhiannon(Aly Michalka), two girls, the virgin and the whore, who aren't all that dissimilar from their twentieth-century counterparts played by Thora Birch and Mena Suvari in Sam Mendes' \"American Beauty\". In the Mendes film, the friendship sours the moment Jane(Birch) embarks on a love affair with Ricky(Wes Bentley), an unexpected development that intimidates the usually undauntable Angela(Suvari), since as it turns out, her boastful talk about wanting to do \"it\" with Jane's father is all an act. She's a virgin too, like Rhiannon, perhaps, which would explain why the daughter of nudists would turn against Olive, when the purported wild girl should be thrilled to have a partner-in-crime(ala Nicky Reed and Evan Rachel Wood in Catherine Hardwicke's \"Thirteen\": the mother played by Patricia Clarkson has a little Holly Hunter in her). Previously, with bravado and post-feminist glee, Rhiannon squeals in delight upon learning that her caller ID name on Olive's cell phone is \"big t**s\", a sure indication that Olive may have a body image problem, as Jane did in \"American Beauty\", when she explores the possibility of breast implants. She feels like a \"plain Jane\", so does Olive, that's why the good girl turns \"bad\"; the good girl feels the pressure to compete, but the moviegoer may want to hedge his/her bets that the good girl may be in a one-woman race against a c*cktease. Who can forget the scene between Suvari and Kevin Spacey, when the jailbait temptress reverts back into a quivering schoolgirl, as Lester gets ready to ravish her. (He didn't realize the rose petals in his sex fantasy about Angela, signified a deflowering.) As played by Spacey, Lester Burnham had no morals. Whereas in \"Easy A\", the English teacher played by Thomas Haden Church, is kept in check by some girls(Amanda Bynes is their queen bee) who belong to an on-campus church group. Sanctimonious and annoying as they may appear to be, the moviegoer should be aware of the sexual overtones, albeit Victorian ones, which makes Nathaniel Hawthorne's \"The Scarlet Letter\" a fairly incendiary book; a book that could be employed to help seduce a bright and naive female student by some unscrupulous teacher. The wife's affair with a male student is treated like a surprise plot twist, suggesting that the transgression was supposed to occur between Olive and Mr. Griffith. But alas, while Christian values take its lumps, Christian values save the day; saves the teacher's job, because Olive never does turn into Hester Prynne, never commits adultery. The \"A\" stitched to her dress signifies nothing; it's merely a fashion accessory. She never does get that easy \"A\" from the English teacher. She's a good girl. And that's progress. Back in 1990, to be America's Sweetheart, Julia Roberts played the hooker with a heart of gold, whereas Emma Stone, in a long line of heir apparents since then, plays a fake hooker who takes the fake orgasm to the next level."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This film deserves every bit of praise that has been thrown at it. It's the smartest teen movie in a long while, bolstered by an incredibly charismatic lead and a clever supporting cast. Emma Stone makes her snarkiness endlessly appealing and cute. The supporting cast, most notably Patricia Clarkson, Thomas Haden Church, Lisa Kudrow, and Stanley Tucci are scene-stealers in the best way possible. Easy A is a great way to finish off a summer with numerous great comedies. However, Easy A just might be the best."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "A very good movie, pure and simple. Emma Stone is charming and was definitely a good choice and the supporting characters are just delightful. The wit that you've heard so much about in the professional reviews is alive and well and there some great jokes (some a little corny, but the rest are very funny and pretty). Finally a high school comedy with some actual charm and substance, (which in my opinion are few and far between). If your a guy and your girlfriend drags you into seeing this movie, you may come out pleasantly surprised."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Pop culture aficionados will be adding quotations from the zinger-filled \"Easy A\" to their repertoires. Cleverly uses Hawthorne's \"The Scarlet Letter\" as a departure point for examining today's mores, envisioning them through the lens of John Hughes. Strong performances all around, a great ensemble."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "This bouncy teen flick tries to be like so many others, but it seldom generates real laffs. Emma Stone pretends to have sex with loser boys and becomes known as the school's Hester Prynne (look it up). Clich\u00c3\u00a9s include wacky adults (with one cool one), campus cliques and an ambiguous (not really) romantic interest. Since the scenario is so obvious, the characters and dialogue must sustain the humor. This one has an energetic spirit, but not much originality or real comedy."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "This film is awful and the strong reviews for it very disappointing. I had very high hopes that it would be a smart teen comedy but instead every character is overwritten. The story non-sensical; it seems as though the script was written and overwritten a number of times with each person trying to add yet another twist. Why is everyone talking this way; why would a character who fakes being a prostitute be surprised someone thinks of her that way? In what highschool is one person having sex the talk of the institution? The really sad thing is that Easy A could have been a really smart comedy; instead its just a mess."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "The whole film just glides on Emma Stone's hilarious and charming performance.

However, everyone should be able to be happy in the moment and not only in a possible future that might still take years to come. Easy A uses an extreme amount of American stereotypes, is sometimes funny, and the parents' characters are very charming."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "This was just a another stupid \"chick flick.\" I can't believe that these types of movies are what my generation watches now.  This movie is about a nerdy girl who pretends to lose her virginity so she can become popular, it was exceedingly boring.  I thought the actors were below talented.  I must say that the only funny scenes were when Emma Stone's parents where in it."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Why is this movie being praised? It's really truly not a good film.

I have a best friend who has zero redeeming qualities and parents who have borderline personality disorder.

I would encourage critics who laud this movie to be intellectually honest. Who are the real hypocrites here?"}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Another hypersexualized teen comedy, though warmed by a good supporting cast and Emma Stone's appealing performance. Do California schools really let girls come to class in lingerie? I'm not sure, but Stone's fun and witty character was written more like a smarter character on \"Friends\" than a teenager with actual moments of angst. Never as touching as \"Juno,\" for example. And there's nothing smart or cutting-edge about a teen comedy portraying EVERY \"Christian\" character as a hypocritical idiot. What really would be groundbreaking is portraying one of them as compassionate and sincere."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "I just read that Emma Stone dropped out of Sucker Punch to do this movie (Source: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1282140/trivia) . Bad decision in my opinion!"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Did Easy A deserve its grade, or was it an epic fail? Well, Easy A stars Emma Stone (Zombieland), as Olive Penderghast, an anonymous nobody in high school. Her only friends are Aly Michalka (From the band 78violet), as Rhiannon, a mid- popular hottie who likes to curse. Michalka was hilarious, and definitely proved she's not a Disney Channel girl anymore. Her other friend/crush is Penn Badgely (The Stepfather), as Woodchuck Todd. His performance was bland and boring, however unique in a way where his humor was dry, yet funny. Her final friend is Brandon, played by Dan Byrd (Cougar Town) is her homosexual friend, who fakes having sex with Olive to earn popularity points. Although he was only in the movie for about 8-10 minutes, Byrd's performance was very gay. I guess that's good acting.... Her enemies are pretty much the entire school Christian club, but Marianne, played by Amanda Bynes (Sydney White) is her main nemesis, who also starts the entire rumor of her losing her virginity. Bland and boring, this is Bynes' last... and worst acting role she has ever done. Thomas Haden Church (Spider Man 3), Lisa Kudrow (Hotel For Dogs), and Malcolm McDowell (Halloween 2), play school faculty members, who are very funny. If you haven't seen or heard about this movie, you must be blind and deaf, so there's no need to explain this movie. Overall, the movie was great, however the last third of the movie turned more into a drama. So, Easy A may not have gotten an A, but it did get an: A-"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I thought this film was OK but no more . It was nowhere near as funny as Juno was and to be honest I don't think it will ring any bells with a European audience (of which I am one). No teenager in Europe has ever gone through an existentialist crisis at the thought of losing their virginity (especially at the age of 17), and to see a 21 year old guy being slapped around by his mother for having caught chlamydia was a step too far for me.
