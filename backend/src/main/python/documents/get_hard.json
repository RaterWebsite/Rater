  "description": "When obscenely rich hedge-fund manager James is convicted of fraud and sentenced to a stretch in San Quentin, the judge gives him one month to get his affairs in order. Knowing that he won't survive more than a few minutes in prison on his own, James desperately turns to Darnell-- a black businessman who's never even had a parking ticket -- for help. As Darnell puts James through the wringer, both learn that they were wrong about many things, including each other.",

      "text": "The first 20 minutes of so of the movie are pretty mediocre but they set the stage for the hilarity that ensues in the next hour plus, where Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart are comedic geniuses. They play the same roles they typically do, with Hart being a pint-sized black man with a lot of bark and little bite and Ferrell being the big, lumbering air head who's innocence and ignorance somehow make him endearing and obnoxious at the same time. However, those roles blend together perfectly in this movie as the two have great on-screen chemistry. The supporting cast is also fantastic and this movie is, overall, a really good comedy that most people will likely enjoy."

I think the racism was a little over hyped, sure there is some racist humour but its not as plentiful as the critics have been saying. Will Ferrell is really funny as he always is and Kevin Hart wasn't bad either, he had some pretty funny moments. One of the things that was disappointing about Get Hard was that they were putting too many jokes in that were just not funny and there were several but other than that I would enjoy seeing another movie with Ferrell and Hart together and it seems like the two have bonded over the shooting of the movie and I would not be shocked to see it."

      "text": "\"Get Hard\" 10 Scale Rating: 5.5 (Decent) ...\r The Good: The premise is an amusing one and Ferrell and Hart make for a great odd couple. As their relationship turns from one where they are simply using each other to one of true friendship, it is believable and sincere. Hart's lines are hilarious and you can tell that he was allowed to ad lib often. Ferrell had his moments too and there were a few scenes that I couldn't help but laugh out loud at.  Craig T. Nelson and T.I. did excellent jobs in supporting roles. Not as funny as it should have been, but a decent comedy all the same.\r The Bad: I expected more hilarity from this duo and the film is inconsistent in that regard. Most of the amusing scenes were given to Farrell as opposed to Hart, which was disappointing. Hart is clearly on the top of his game and Ferrell has lost a step or two. Some aspects of the ending were too silly and went too far. Lastly, the film relied too much on racist and homophobic humor. I don't personally  mind such jokes if done well, but they felt forced and dated here."

      "text": "Get Hard tries to be a over the top, racist, profane and vulgar comedy. But the laughs are overused, and add no spice to the aging theme. The story plays out with James King (Will Ferrell) who gets convicted of a felony he never committed, and he gets sentenced to 5 years in a maximum security prison in San Quentin. James uses the help of his car washer, Darnell Lewis (Kevin Hart) to teach him the basics of prison, and how he can survive in the godforsaken place. But, Darnell never went to prison! Get Hard uses James to use his racist stereotypes against Lewis to make it funny. Sure, Kevin Hart does his best, and gives us some belly laughs, but Will Ferrell's racist, rich and totally bonkers, James King is one of the worst things about Get Hard. The pair do well together, even against the badly written script, the mediocre direction and the bland story, to create a funny movie. I appreciate the ways Get Hard takes you under the \"hood\" of prisons, and tells you about rape, and assaults in prison from a funny perspective. And, T.I gives a good performance as a Crenshaw Kings boss. All this, could have summed up to a really funny movie, but Get Hard doesn't try enough to get that medal. It's badly written, racist, offensive and gives us the worst Will Ferrell performance in years. But, if you don't get offended easily, Get Hard may be fun for you."

To start, this movie had a decent premise, kevin hart has to teach wil ferrell to survive in jail. Awesome idea for a comedy. Does this movie fulfil it's potential? Kinda. On one hand, the chemistry between the two actors is great, I love how will ferrel has to fit in with the ghetto and I loved the amount of slapstick comedy this had to offer. However, there were some points in the movie where I thought it would be easier to just move the conversation along as nothing particularly funny was happening. Overall, Get Hard will make you laugh for the majority of your experience and is filled with offensive humour and stereotypes."

This is going to be a short review for this garage movie, why well I haven't got anything else to say about it because why should I go into such much detail for this movie that I will not remember it in a few days time.\r The story is about a millionaire faces a prison sentence following a fraud conviction and in order to survive life behind bars, turns to Darnell Lewis to toughen up.\r Listen March has been a slow month for me because there are some of the new releases that I haven't checked out yet and yes I pretty much review movies everyday and I do have my breaks time again, but screw it life is short so start reviewing. The title \"Get Hard\" sounds like a porn video you will come across on PornHub.com, why can't they just called the movie Get tough or something like that, because people are going to take the title not very well and it would be really awkward to shout it out it in public. Anywhere with the other disappointments so far in March that I had interest that turned out to be a big massive f**k you to the auditions and me, and Get Hard can join those titles because this movie sucks.\r The jokes in the movie came off sexist and kind of racist and you should know by now that I can't stand those jokes because I can picture in my head that all these people out there are getting hurt by this and stupid humor is unacceptable.\r Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell are fine in the movie but I rather like to see them in better movies than this. But overall as I said early on this movie isn't going to be talked about probably never again by some people, but for me your going to this again...in my worst of the year list right next to Unfinished Business."

      "text": "Comedy finds a winning duo in Hart and Ferrell. The two are able to bounce jokes off of another with ease thanks to their surprising chemistry. Ferrell does what he does best here, and that's playing an over-the-top and absurd character. Hart's character is more down to earth and tasked with preparing this airhead for prison despite not actually going there himself.\r Along the way plenty of laughs ensue. There are plenty of hilarious one-liners and larger set pieces. It's also gives a very amusing look at gang and prison lifestyles. The vulgar and often raunchy style of the humor means that this isn't going to be for everyone, and a lot of the racial humor is bound to offend many, but those without a stick up their butt who don't think everything needs to be prim and proper are sure to find plenty of laughs. Sometimes it's just fun to laugh at the profane, and \"Get Hard\" gives us plenty of reasons to do that.\r It's probably one of the first comedies I've seen with Kevin Hart that doesn't hold the talented comedian back. He's allowed to be his quick-witted, profanity-spewing self when it comes to the jokes and the whole thing is much funnier as a result. The film also makes great use of Ferrell's talent for playing out there characters. The results are hilarious as the two comedians work together excellently. It's a very funny comedy that I recommend as long as you can put up with some offensive humor. Provided you can do that there is a lot to laugh at here. Get Hard takes a potentially disastrous duo and brings them together perfectly.\r I give this movie a 9.3/10."

Yes kind of similar theme, but there's a lot of difference. The concept was the same and the story happens in an alternate way like 'what if'. That means one takes place outside the prison and the other one in the prison. If you're a movie fanatic, you would enjoy the show other than going after flaws and resemblance.\r I had seen many weird combos, and I felt same feeling for this Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart, when I first heard about it. Like usual, once I watched the movie seem to be okay. Quite a show and equally good, one of the funniest combinations to entertain. I had a few good laughs and enjoyed the film. I would love to get a sequel for this, because these men coming together are double fun. So it should not be wasted ending with a one-off movie, but at least a duology or maybe a trilogy. Gosh, my crazy thought and expectation!\r 6.5/10"

The premise is promising, but the movie relies on lame predictable subjects (gay panic, racial stereotypes, obvious villains) instead of genuine comic writing. Hart's motor mouth provides most of laffs, while Farrell's broad, buffoon style is often annoying. There are memorable out comic moments and almost nobody in the supporting cast adds any humor (T.J. Jagodowski's friendly gay is an exception). The dialogue feels like writer/director Elan Cohen let the 2 leads improvise most of the bits and didn't exercise any control on their effusive styles. Their chemistry's not bad and there are some funny parts, but more often it just tries too hard."

There are a couple of good laughs but they are mostly buried under an avalanche of insulting stereotypes and unfunny improvisation. As with most of Ferrell's recent films the director seems reluctant to call cut, allowing scenes already unfunny to drag on interminably. Ferrell is due a return to form at some point, but this isn't it."

It's not the best R-rated comedy but I loved that it's roars it's R rating, and is laugh out loud funny at times, and the chemistry that Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart is easy going. James King (Will Ferrell) is a rich and is a financial analyst  he has a huge mansion in Bel Air, lives with a soon to be married beautiful fianc\u00e9 Allissa (Allison Brie) and is promoted by Allissa's father Martin (Craig T.

Darnell wants to get Makayla and Rita out of the neighborhood and school hoping his daughter will go to another school. James is convicted and fraud sentenced to 10 years in San Quetitin. So he wants Darnell, the guy who washes his car, to help him survive in prison Darnell didn't go to prison, James just thinks he did because of his skin color. James is flat out racist, I honestly didn't care if he goes to prison or not that's how unlikeable he is. The cheap script by Etan Cohen (Tropic Thunder), Ian Roberts (Martin & Orloff) and Jay Martal gives us a few laughs here and there but honestly they know better than this mediocrity so does Ferrell and Hart but they make this mediocrity funny at times.
