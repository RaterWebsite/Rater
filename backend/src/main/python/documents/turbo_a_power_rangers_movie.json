      "text": "Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie is also enjoyable and a stupid movie that is good for nostalgia and laughs, if you\u2019re a Mighty Morphin Power Rangers fan you might like this movie since it has some of the cast in it like Tommy, Adam, and Katherine, in the actual Power Rangers Turbo series they stay for like 20 episodes before being replaced."
