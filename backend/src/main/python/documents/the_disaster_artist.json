As it turns out, apparently Franco stumbled upon the real heart of the story while digging through all the behind-the-scenes information on the best worst movie ever made and instead chose to make his film about the unlikely friendship that made it all happen in the first place.On top of directing and producing, Franco even stars as ol' Tommy Wiseau himself. His accent is actually really good and he expertly manages to capture so many of Wiseau's distinctive quirks. The laugh in particular is spot-on. He never plays it like he's making fun of the guy. Instead choosing to let Wiseau's humanity be the main focus of his embodiment.The Disaster Artist never derides The Room for laughs. It's comedy comes from knowing winks like Franco's intentional overplaying of the \"NAAHT\" in one of the source material's most memorable lines, as well as the natural reactions one would have when being presented with Wiseau's unorthodox behavior and approach to filmmaking. It's all much more heartfelt than one might expect.The casting of Dave Franco as Greg Sestero was a good choice. On top of just looking more like a brother to Greg than he ever did to James, Dave's role as the second leading man lends more credibility to the friendship at the movie's core by allowing the Franco's to play off of their natural connection as brothers. It's the first time I've ever come close to liking little Not James.The Disaster Artist is the best way to experience The Room. You get to witness a lot of it's most memorably, wonderfully terrible moments without the shame of having actually watched it. All of the joy, none of the regret. Certain gags might not have the same effect, but they'll still prove to be plenty hilarious. Plus it stands on it's own as a surprisingly sweet and sincere film with a magnetic central performance from James Franco. So you don't need to have seen it's inspiration to enjoy what this movie has to offer.9.7/10"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "An outsider watching this movie will probably see a normal dude hanging out with a disabled person and somehow making a movie. However, The Disaster Artist is aimed for the fans of The Room and Tommy Wiseau. The film shows how Tommy works and does things, although nobody really knows that, and most importantly, the film shows \"what could have been\"-scenes which make every Tommy Wiseau fan feel sympathy for him. This is a great tribute to Tommy. I think James Franco grasped what kind of a person Tommy Wiseau is and he found a great medium to portrait that. Every fan of The Room, Tommy and the book by Greg is going to love this movie."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "A brilliant film with side splitting moments of Joy for fans of 'The Room' and moments of real despair as James Franco really becomes Tommy Wiseau and you can see this was really a film he cared about making."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I saw The Disaster Artist in an early screening on 25th of November. The screening was packed with people who had all seen The Room, and everyone applauded during the end credits. The Disaster Artist is an excellent adaptation of the book. It's filled with great performances, especially James Franco as Tommy Wiseau who was just hysterical at points, and Dave Franco who was also really good as Greg Sestero and unsurprisingly he and James Franco had great chemistry together. Also the directing - while not mind-blowing - was pretty good too, there was a lot of going on in every scene which made it interesting to watch and especially one scene at the movie set which was a long one shot of just yelling and arguing that was just hilarious. The movie also never actually laughed at Tommy Wiseau, it was actually really sad to see him sad in a couple of scenes, it was handled brilliantly. Although the film never really developed any other characters than Wiseau and Sestero, it was still pretty fantastic. I strongly recommend it to everyone and especially fans of The Room."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Oh, Hi everyone. I am so glad James Franco didn't make a mean-spirited condescending movie with a two-dimensional portrayal of Tommy Wiseau. I was expecting that when I first heard about this movie, knowing some of Franco's other projects. But the movie is not that. It's empathic. It celebrates people who are brave enough to do what they love even if they are bad at it. That's so tragic to be bad at something you love doing.  I love that the movie criticized the audience too for laughing at him. After a bad performance an acting teacher tells Tommy he has the look of a villain, trying to help him get work. Tommy responds that he doesn't feel like a villain. The audience is the villain for laughing at him. Why do we laugh at him? There are plenty of bad actors that aren't entertaining. I think the comedy mostly comes from Tommy's inability to reconcile what he wants to be with what he actually is. In other words he is delusional. Is it mean-spirited to laugh at that?It would be so ironic if James Franco won the oscar for best actor portraying one of the worst! He did an incredible job and sadly for Tommy, he may deserve it.  We'll see how it stacks up against some other good performances coming out soon."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Easily one of the best, funniest movies of the year (which isn't saying a ton - this year has been rough). Franco is incredible as Tommy - yes, he slightly exaggerates the accent for comic effect, but it's not a caricature. The supporting cast is really an all-star cast of comic talent. And Jackie Weaver?  How the hell did they get her for this?  Judd Apatow's scene is pretty amazing on a number of levels. It's an American Dream story mixed with the mysteries of Tommy (where's he from?  Where'd he get the $$? How old is he?)

Even those who haven't seen 'The Room' will still likely be able to enjoy and appreciate this film's quirky style and humor, but I'd say that it's definitely a little better and one will likely appreciate it a bit more if they watch 'The Room' first. The whole ensemble cast does a wonderful job, but director/star James Franco is darn near perfect as the eccentric Tommy Wiseau, alongside a committed and worthwhile performance from his brother Dave as Greg Sestero (Oh hi Mark!) Furthermore, the film touches upon and playfully recreates all of the best and most iconic scenes and fan-favorite moments from 'The Room' and even teaches us a few new things or so about what went on behind the scenes while making the film. Overall, it's informative and undeniably funny both as a film in and of itself and as a tribute to one of the best worst films ever made!"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "If you didn't know anything about filmmaker Tommy Wiseau and saw James Franco play him in this movie, you'd think he's gone insanely over the top. In fact, he nails the character's unusual accent, impulsive actions and overall weirdness. Wiseau wrote, directed and starred in what some people consider the worst movie ever made, THE ROOM. This biopic details his friendship with an aspiring young actor (played by Dave Franco, James' real-life brother) and his bizarre and bungled attempts to make the movie. James Franco (who also directed) captures the character's offbeat comments and random timing to delightful comical effect. The whole experience is incredible in an absurdly amazing way.

Half the movie is spent on this painfully awkward introduction to Mark and Tommy's \"friendship\". This friendship really comes off as Mark realizing that Tommy was rich and so he uses Tommy and his money to further his potential acting career. Progressively through the movie, We kind of see that confirmation as Mark becomes frustrated with not just making the film but also with lack of work as an actor and in turn he takes the frustrations out on Tommy,  who genuinely seems to be lost in his own little world.And performance wise, I get that they have to act terribly when re-creating scenes from the actual film but even when they are acting outside of that, The cast still does a bad job at acting in general. It just doesn't sit right. And I didn't find the movie funny at all, I found it more pathetic than anything.

I am cognizant of the fact that seeing the source film and understanding how insanely bad it is makes The Disaster Artist a different experience.

And as someone who has recently watched The Room before seeing The Disaster Artist you do not have to see it unless you really want to, because it really is as terrible as you've heard. In fact it's probably worse. The mystery that is Tommy Wiseau, whether he's just a little eccentric or downright bonkers one thing's for sure he is going to be a star and he is going to make the greatest movie ever. Where he came from, how old he is and where the seemingly endless pit of money is coming from no one knows but sit back and enjoy James Franco completely transform himself into Wiseau and get a taste of what went on behind the scenes of the making of The Room.The Room is so horrendously terrible you either love it or hate it but no matter how you feel about it everyone can appreciate The Disaster Artist for its charm, humour and the spectacular recreation of the original scenes from The Room. The attention to detail in every way was perfect, not a movie to leave during the end credits. It begins with the friendship between Tommy Wiseau and Greg Sestero and continues with their decision to move to LA in an attempt to make it as big movie stars. When this doesn't happen the way they expect Wiseau decides to write, produce, star and direct his own masterpiece and thus The Room was born. You don't always see an actor completely lose themselves in a role but James Franco does just that effortlessly. At no point do you see James, he pays homage to Tommy brilliantly and only the way a true fan could. One minute you're laughing at his performance and the next you're filled with sympathy for his character. Everything that seemed to go on behind the scenes of The Room was a disaster I only wished they had shown a little more in that area and a little less of the build up. A movie about the making of a movie so bad over time it developed a cult following. It's easy to make a bad movie, there's so many you can take your pick but to make a bad movie that so many people love is rare. The Disaster Artist is up there with Ed Wood and it's highly recommended."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Though certainly not a masterpiece, The Disaster Artist tells the story it wanted to tell and does it wonderfully.

James and Dave Franco put on a powerhouse performance that will not only leave you in stitches, but will also touch your heart and really connect you with the characters.

At points, I forgot I was watching James Franco and thought I WAS watching Tommy Wiseau! I think James Franco will easily get a nomination for best leading actor this year in the Academy Awards, and I would wager money that he will definitely be taking home the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Comedy. The Disaster Artist is also an incredibly strong contender for Best Adapted Screenplay. This movie is a MUST-SEE for fans of the so-bad-its-good cult classic The Room. I will give one caveat about my 9 rating: if you love The Room, this is easily a9 or 10. If you have never heard of The Room, then The Disaster Artist probably only rates a 7 or 8."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "The Disaster Artist is based off of the book by Greg Sestero about, in a nutshell, the making of The Room.

I really really liked \"The Disaster Artist\" and it would easily be one of the best comedies of 2017 and one of my favorite movies of the year.  Ultimately it treats Tommy slightly sympathetically which helps with the humor and is mostly a buddy-movie about friendship and following your dreams.  The only failing of the film would maybe be how it did not shine a critical light on his character or delve too deeply into what makes him tick, but as a comedy that was not its objective, so it didn't dwell too long on the negatives, besides a few moments in 1 or 2 scenes, 1 of which being the most telling of the character in the film..which is only about 30 seconds.

We see a young Greg Sestero (Dave Franco) struggling in acting class back in 1998, he gets nervous to recite his lines in front of large groups of people, and feels as if this may not be the right path for him. It is there that he meets a strange, long-haired, weird accent, and odd fashion sense of a man named Tommy Wiseau (James Franco), who doesn't mind over-acting and trying to give his best in front of these people. Greg is fascinated by Tommy's confidence and ambition, so he wants to hang out with him, and maybe get some advice. Tommy agrees, and they both form an unstoppable friendship together, always watching James Dean, and making the abrupt decision to travel to Los Angeles to fully realize their acting dreams. Tommy and Greg try everything they can to audition for roles, but the casting agents don't see any potential in any of their charisma, or lack there-of. Greg ends up meeting a girl at a club named Amber (Alison Brie), and Tommy sees that this will cause a bit of friction in their friendship, as he needs Greg to focus 100% on their dreams. After nothing but rejections from all over, Tommy is feeling emotionally drenched about it, and is ready to give up. However, Greg comes up with the idea that they should just make their own movie to show up everyone. That is where 'The Room' (2003) was made. The movie, directed by James Franco, and based off Greg Sestero's book \"The Disaster Artist: My Life Inside The Room\", does a great job at making Tommy Wiseau seem sympathetic, since there have been many parodies of portraying Wiseau and making him seem like an idiot, this is not a satirical take on the character. The comedy is very minimal, and the drama is genuine. 'The Room' (2003) is one of the worst movies ever made, and I rated it 0/10, but as a comedy, it is a 10. To discover the amount of crazy ambition and stress that went into making that movie is fascinating.

Franco successfully copied Wiseau's speech, expressions and mannerisms to the most minute detail, and I thought no-one would ever be able to do that. His younger brother Dave Franco portrays Greg Sestero. This movie also focuses on the human side of Wiseau and Sestero, not just their public personas. The scene in the end, where Wiseau is devastated by his film's apparent failure at its premiere and Sestero consoles him, is really great.There is plenty to enjoy for fans of The Room. The behind the scenes developments are shown during the filming of The Room, and there are also perfect remakes of some classic The Room scenes. But if you haven't already seen The Room, you won't appreciate The Disaster Artist at all. It's a fan-service movie above all else, and also a movie for James Franco to make a name for himself with an unbelievable performance. Franco deserved to get an Academy Award for his successful portrayal of a unique person like Tommy Wiseau, but he wasn't even nominated for some reason.All in all, The Disaster Artist is made for The Room fans. If you haven't seen The Room go watch it first, and then proceed to The Disaster Artist."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "James Franco is absolutely fantastic as Wiseau and the film has an endearing sense of sincerety, other than these two positive aspect I did not find the film to be that exceptional. Most of the scenes that were funny were the recreations and I found the \"moving\" emotional scenes to be sorta cute, but overly schmaltzy. I found The Disaster Artist to be kinda bland and more or less boring. It's extremely overhyped. I'd say that you'll probably enjoy it more if you haven't seen the original, but as far as a recommendation goes, go watch The Room instead."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I mean, this movie hit it right, i haven't watched The Room, but i definitely want to watch it... imagine that, i want to watch the so called \"best worst movie ever\". James Franco did wonders in this part, and Seth Rogen was fantastic, and leaving the mistery behind Tommy Wiseau is also a great way to end. Of course there are menor issues like the fact that they should have dove more into the start of the Tommy and Greg friendship, because it seems they just become friends out of the blue and in a day he's moving to LA with someone. But i enjoyed myself watching this and made me appreciate James Franco even more"}, {"rating": "5", "text": "It's kind of sad when the whole point of a movie is to show how well James Franco can impersonate someone and shove it in everybody's face...."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "The disaster artist is about the making of the cult movie \"The Room\", so you should see that first instead to appreciate \"The Disaster Artist\" better. What's good about this film? James Franco's acting is superb in imitating Tommy Wiseau, it's quite funny if you liked the first movie and has nice insights on our favorite trash movie.It's not groundbreaking though and will not make you laugh as hard as the real film. Still worth watching if you are a fan of \"The Room\"."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This movie definitely maked me appreciate The Room way more than i already did, it showed how tough it was and how courageous they were. I like how the movie teach you that if you want something, you gotta go for it, just like that, don't make questions, but work hard investing your time and whatever else you could to make it happen, not mattering where you from, how old you are or who you know. Tommy Wiseau story on motivating and doing this movie is fantastic, how no one believed in him and how he was affraid to say that he wasn't even from U.S., probably because of the fear of repression, then he just said \"you know what? i'm gonna do this anyway\", or better.. We gonna do this, because Greg also have a nice story. The way that Tommy convinces Greg to get on that trip is just simply and well done by James Franco, which brings us to the actors performance, James and Dave Franco do a great job, because they are brothers the chemistry works very well, so together as individually. James Fraco transmits the character, almost perfectly, facets, extravagance, passion and personality, the accent is great and very close to the real one. \"HAHAHA\"Technically the movie is operant, it works but isn't special, but it is very funny and dramatic, the end of the movie really puts you in some emotional moment that you can feel it, much because of Francos acting.I believe that the post-production of The Room could have been more exploited, the dubbing and the montage could have provided some comic moments. The recreation of scenes are phenomenal that in general gonna put you in laugh mode.I like to say that the room is a terrible voluntary drama and a great involuntary comedy. The disaster artist literally makes you feel how hard and worthy was that movie, trying to score a goal and ending up making a basket brilliantly."}], "recommendations": ["the_upside", "inherent_vice", "eddie_the_eagle", "the_king_of_staten_island", "greenberg", "changeling", "logan_lucky", "the_irishman", "magnolia", "joker", "eternal_sunshine_of_the_spotless_mind", "the_royal_tenenbaums", "the_bucket_list", "rush", "tusk", "mystic_river", "the_green_mile", "chef", "million_dollar_baby", "american_hustle", "the_shawshank_redemption", "the_lucky_one", "ghostbusters", "hustlers", "true_grit"]}
