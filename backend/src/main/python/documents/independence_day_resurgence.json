Probably because it goes wrong in so many different ways, but not so much to fall completely flat in any one category.\r Only ten minutes in and you'll realize the story is far too disjointed.  There's no flow to the movie.  There's no time to make us care about the characters, or for character progression, or much in the way of back stories.  Which might not be a bad thing considering how bland the new cast is.\r Also, if a movie is going to take itself serious, it better make logical sense.  This movie had so many cop-outs and miraculous coincidences, it's difficult to suspend your disbelief long enough to actually enjoy it.  The characters often make incredible leaps of insight that no one could actually do.  \"They're drilling.  Oh, they must be here to harvest our molten core!\"  What?  How'd you come to that conclusion?  I mean, even the opening credits had a logic fail, where the aliens somehow had a recording of the President's 4th of July speech from the original movie!  How exactly did they get that?\r I think the biggest problems with this movie were the screenwriting and the directing.  Scenes often didn't go together cohesively in a logical way.  Their homages to the original amounted to basically copying and pasting lines directly from it.  Most of the gags fell short, or were overly cheesy for the seriousness of what was going down.  Characters didn't react realistically to what was going on around them.  I could go on and on with these faults.\r As I mentioned before, the visuals were top-notch.  I have a serious hatred for CGI that doesn't look realistic, yet gladly this movie doesn't fall into that trap.  It has plenty of CGI, but it is incredibly well done.  Too bad the other aspects of the movie don't match up.\r If nothing else, this movie has shown me how much I want a GOOD space opera.  Yet sadly, it may also be the reason we don't get one in the near future.\r Good luck with that third installment Fox."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "It took them 20 years to forget how to make a really engaging blockbuster.\r This movie is fine. The effects are excellent. The people are pretty. What's lacking here, something that the original had in abundance, is the human element.\r This marks a significant change in film making since the mid-90s and is specifically a feature of modern blockbusters.\r There is not a single character in this film. There are cardboard cutouts of character types who are given a two-beat backstory that the audience is somehow supposed to care about instantly.\r The first ID spent a full half of the movie introducing audiences to the people in the story. It raised the stakes and made the later actiony bits mean something. IDR does none of that and leaves you feeling hollow about the whole affair."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Independence Day: Resurgence is here, and it would seem with the direction they went that Independence Day may have been better if it hadn\u2019t had a sequel. The original film was admittedly dumb, and considering Roland Emmerich\u2019s filmography I didn\u2019t go in expecting this film to be thought provoking, but Independence Day: Resurgence lacks the impactful moments the first one had. Independence Day: Resurgence is full of cliches, features weak characters, and lacks the iconic moments of the original. It is sad to say but given the filmography of Roland Emmerich, the fact that this movie isn\u2019t very good isn\u2019t a surprise.\rThe original Independence Day wasn\u2019t very original, but it found a way to surpass it\u2019s generic approach with entertaining acting and storytelling. However, Independence Day: Resurgence loses some of that charm, and ends up being even more generic. The story takes a radical departure from the realistic approach of the first one, and puts the audience in a super technologically advanced earth. The film is also hurt by the lack of charismatic leads, who have been replaced by young more dull actors.\rThe problem is partially that the actors aren\u2019t all that good, whether that\u2019s a lack of direction or a lack of ability is up for debate. That being said the actors are only part of the problem, as even if they were great the characters are one dimensional. Another major problem is that the original film was a perfect example of dumb fun, where it was funny and frankly dumb, the sequel is just as dumb, if not more and half as funny. The end result is when a major character dies or anything happens in this film it\u2019s hard to care.\rThe lack of care for major moments resonates as the ultimate disappointment of Independence Day: Resurgence. Even if you hate Independence Day you can\u2019t deny that when Bill Pullman delivers his speech, everybody watching gets a little emotional, and there are various other moments from that film that resonate. There are next to none of these moments in Independence Day: Resurgence. In the end Independence Day: Resurgence is boring because it\u2019s not emotionally gripping, and just trugs along.\rIndependence Day: Resurgence is in essence a sequel made purely for the profit, that departs from what made the first film so special. The sequel is inferior to the original in most aspects, and in some areas doesn\u2019t even feel like a sequel to Independence Day. The characters are one dimensional, the story is generic and cliched, the dialogue is weak, the film is incredibly dumb, but admittedly the special effects are amazing. In the end if you like action and want a release where you can go and just shut your brain off, then this is for you, otherwise you may be disappointed."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Independence Day: Resurgence is your basic dumb summer action movie that dose it's job well of entertaining you, but the flaws is something that shouldn't be ignored despite people telling you to ignore them.\r The effect's (for the most part) was pretty solid and Jeff Goldblum being the best part of this movie is no surprise. You just can't get enough of the Goldblum, as he always got this welcoming presence to him in every movie he's in. I was never bored while watching the movie and this is the kind of the film that would have been great if it was released in the 90's like the first movie, as this would have fitted right in.\r Unfortunately, \"Resurgence\" misses a lot of the charm and charisma that the first film had, as the squeal is just mindless entertainment and if you enjoy those type of films then you most likely going to like this one. The amount of coincidences that happens in this movie is quite unbelievable, with character's coming across each other by accident or how the problems are solved was way too easy. And it's attempt of humor was a bit awkward and force, but that's mostly because the movie doesn't want to be too dark or serious for audience members, so the humor is thrown in there to lighten up the mood.\r Overall rating: \"Independence Day: Resurgence\" is a sloppy but enjoyable movie that's only mindless fun....kinda like the first movie in a way."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "This movie is a huge disappointment.\r There are too many subplots that lead no make. I did not feel the sorrow that Will Smith's son was supposed to feel when his mother died. I did not feel the love between Chris and the president's daughter.

It makes the whole film look fake because it isn't quality CGI.\r And the ending made no sense.

It's stupid."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "\"Independence Day: Resurgence\" Is Even More Hollow, Superficial, Insubstantial and Infuriating\r We're talking about a film of 1996 that stipulated the directives for the upcoming blockbusters based in the invasions of aliens created by Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin. It was the model for many of the current movies, those empty but entertaining films that are the daily bread in American films, too much CGI, combined with some comedy and drama, the perfect summer film, though, that magic has begun to agonize. \"Resurgence\" lands in the worldwide film market as a sequel in which in addition to not be present the soul of the original, Will Smith, it's responsible for presenting a constant self-parody and not funny at all that makes it easy to find the myriad of lacks of which owns.\r \"We Had Twenty Years to Prepare\", states the tag line at the top of the poster, but were it really twenty years?. After the catastrophic event in 1996, Earth has managed to reinvigorate its weaknesses and they have decided to unify all nations in order to preserve human life -  a help for the writers, they take for granted to United States going  to take the decisions \u2013 creating contraptions of high technology, such as the conception of the speed of the ships or the defiance of gravity , What premise!. \"So Did They\", one fortified attack and more resistant returns to Earth, with powerful strategies that will put at risk millions of lives, again.\r It's not correct to affirm that \"Resurgence\" disappoints, since at no time it promised more than excessive action - a kind of \"Star Wars\" recycled-, aliens - with notable references of the genre -, destruction of cities - \"2012\", also directed by himself - and abundant mentions of its predecessor which give the audience a tone of nostalgia.\r Roland Emmerich is a film director that started his career in his native country Germany, with \"Franzmann\" in 1979 and later with \"The Noah's Ark Principle\" in 1984, which was accused him of recreating American films in Germany. Roland took the decision to try to sneak into cinematic mecca of the world, and he succeeded it, opening his experienced curriculum vitae with \"Universal Soldier\" in 1992 with Jean-Claude Van Damme. He was gradually settling in major film studios with projects such as \"The High Crusade\" and \"Stargate\" both released in 1994. Acquiring knowledge, seniority and expertise in the sci-fi genre, it was in 1996 in where his greatest success was evidenced, Emmerich debuts with  Will Smith \"Independence Day\". He already established as one of the directors most requested in Hollywood launches \"The Day After Tomorrow\" in 2004, \"2012\" in 2009 and a number of projects that had not too much impact, but which were of great help in the construction of a CV so honorary so disconcerting. It's in 2016 when the sequel to his project more outstanding it is released, the final collection of each of his projects and even though have not been praised by movie critics, these are loved and remembered by many viewers, especially his grand debut in the genre.\r Undoubtedly, special effects are the strong point. With amazing visual effects - obviously, executed by CGI and green screens - transform a boring narrative journey in a visual show \"Star Wars\"-style. In one scene of the film, a spaceship arrives on Earth to pick up David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) and his team, at that time in which the ship lands, my brain generated a reaction of unreality, i.e., I thought that the scene was completely fictitious and utopian, but not by its sparkling effects, it was an involuntary reaction that that was not possible. Something unaware to the CGI. Space battles, imposing aliens, an exciting opening scene and much apocalyptic disaster is accomplished in its greatest splendour.\r A plot quite simple and poor, linear and boring with a development for nothing worthy of its predecessor, adorned with stunning visual effects that do not save it of a long and tense space travel. The yawns were unavoidable. The script is full of imperative exclamations; It has not got dramatic base nor much less to real. But the worst were the comic touches, which gradually were horrible, immature and exasperating, destroying to one of the most endearing characters of the original. The script gets all the shortcomings of American projects. The new cast is pathetic, they have no charisma, they have no chemistry, and with total humility and respect there were too many times in where I laughed. Liam H., Maika M. and Usher are some of the new crew.\r The soundscape is clearly inferior than the visual. Harald Kloser and Thomas Wanker were responsible for creating the correct musical ambience that, although not shine in the slightest . It was not bad, but it was standard, something that does not help at all.\r An unnecessary sequel is added to the list of \"Unwanted projects\" and although its effects are amazing, narrative and acting charge of its predecessor has gone to the moon. Finally, \"ID: 3\"  already has been announced and we hope that Will Smith is in this."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "If there is an 'alien action movie 101 for movie makers' then this movie follows it to the last dot.

I found the movie mildly entertaining, much like a Transformers movie, which also promises wanton, unnecessary destruction on a global scale. Neither movies, this or the Transformers franchise, makes any pretenses of sophistication, pathos or intellectually redeeming qualities like The Martian or Interstellar. Jeff Goldblum is funny as is Judd Hirsch. Brent Spiner probably single-handedly carried this movie and of course he sets up the sequel at the end.

And now the sequel is here, and it's once again directed by Roland Emmerich and has the cast of Jeff Goldblum, Liam Hemsworth and unfortunately, there's no Will Smith or Mae Whitman, but there is Bill Pullman.\r So, how good is the movie then? Well, it's one big loud CGI-fest with so much corny dialogue, so pretty much exactly like the first one, in almost every way. You see, while the first movie had charisma and energy, this film has none of that, this is just mindless fun. To be honest, it really makes me miss Will Smith for this film, since he was what made the first film so great. His replacement is so bland and so dull and Liam Hemsworth doesn't bring anything new to the table for me. You know what the best part of this film is? Jeff Goldblum. He actually feels like he is enjoying this movie and is a lot of fun. I also wonder why Maika Monroe was chosen to play the president's daughter when in the original, she was played by Mae Whitman, who is a really great actress right now.\r So, this movie is fun, the CG is sometimes awesome, but it does suffer from having so much stuff on the screen at once. However, one of the biggest problems with this movie, though, is the massive abundance of characters. In the theatre, I was surprised by the amount of times a new character was introduced. Also, Brent Spiner was back in this film and he had way too much screen time. This movie also had one of the most on-the-nose set-ups for Independence Day 3, I was so shocked when watching it.

Heads should roll at 20th Century Fox. The script was absolutely abysmal and the plot and sequences were geared to 5 year olds instead of adult,which by the way are the people who go see movies (if the people at 20th Century) read this. Additionally, I am so sick and tired of Hollywood trying so incredibly hard to be diversified. We had asians, indians, women presidents and fighters, african americans, etc... Sorry, but the United States isn't that diverse. Focus on the scripts instead of political correctness."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "20 Years to write a good script...and they didn't. Don't waste your time on this movie. The only thing good about it are the special effects but I go to the movies to see movies with good storylines, not just video game CGI. The acting is bad, the pacing is bad, the script is just plain terrible. I barely cared about the characters and its a shame because they all know how to act - but given this horrible of a script...yeah, nothing good came out of this movie. Save your money. I would say Red Box it but its such a forgettable and cliche cash grab of a film that you're better off saving your money and not even seeing it at all. Huge disappointment.

But boy are the SFX great! (Who cares.)\r It's twenty years too late, for one. Truly despicable, for two.  Films created specifically to launch other films, that is.  Cobbing an idea from \"Falling Skies,\" \"ID: R\" finds a friendly ally to fight an intergalactic war against the Universe-Hopping-To-Suck-Your-Planet-Core aliens.  You know, kinda like the Borg, but far less believable.  I wonder how the alien light drives work fueled by magma.  Must be some special gas, er, magma tank to withstand 11,000 F molten metal.  Maybe the magma cools.  Oh, I see.  It's really a drive running on iron.  Guess these aliens haven't figured how to mine iron.\r Then there's a queen.  All that's missing from those scenes is Ripley shouting, \"Get away from my planet's core, you ****\r Brent Spiner is ecstatic.  Lot's more screen time, and the final word.  The rest - Jeff Goldblum and Judd Hirsch the biggest perpetrators - either phone it in or sleepwalk through a story so predictable eyes flutter with drowsiness waiting for it to unfold.  And how did Hirsch, all alone, find his son in that huge desert?  Magic, I suppose.\r There's much to be said for brainless entertainment where one allows the idiocy to run down the back like water on a duck.

The kind you watch for the crazy destruction, absurd stakes, and cheesy writing. Resurgence makes it a point to never take itself seriously. It's got a silly sense of humor in the face of it's potentially world ending conflict. The human race is facing it's possible extinction and everyone is smiling and cracking jokes.While this does add a extra sense of fun to the movie, it also makes it hard to really care about what's going on. There's simply no urgency to the events. The new characters are bland and there's no way to get emotionally invested at all. This is the kind of movie you watch for the visual panache and not much else. There's a lot of cool sci-fi stuff onscreen to keep things interesting enough to keep you watching. It just doesn't engage your brain. But hey, it's fun for what it is. I got some laughs and some cool action. That's really all I was expecting anyway. Fans of the first can get a kick out of seeing the familiar faces return (with the exception of Will Smith) and references. Roland Emmerich also makes it pretty clear he's got some ideas for a sequel. Basically, come to have some mindless fun or don't come at all. Resurgence doesn't offer much else.6.6/10"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Not a perfect movie, but definitely worth watching.
