The boys must put aside music super stardom to return to school, and are tasked with saving the school's music program by winning the $25,000 prize in a battle of the bands. But the Chipmunks unexpectedly meet their match in three singing chipmunks known as The Chipettes - Brittany, Eleanor and Jeanette. Romantic and musical sparks are ignited when the Chipmunks and Chipettes square off.",

      "text": "I watched thiz movie with no expectations. I think all of the things that they wanted to show us already appeared in the first movie. So the sequel (which named: The Squeakquel) is only a repetitions on what we saw before. The movie still cast by: Jason Lee and David Cross. The Alvin Character is voiced by Justin Long. The former Director Tim Hill (who also directed GARFIELD, 2004) replaced by Betty Thomas. It is very clear, The movie-makers intend to refresh things up by the appearance of new characters, The Chippetes (the girl version of The Chipmunks). Members of The Chippetes are: Brittany (Christina Applegate), Jeanette (Anna Faris), Eleanor (Amy Poehler). We certain knew the trio as creditable Drama-Comediennes. I think in some ways, the movie is less musical than the first one. The Chippetes performance looks like based on the nowadays Hip Hop style. If we looked at the human characters, Zachary Levi who seems to have more proportion than Jason Lee, both of them did not make us stunned by their performance. Their role definitely could be replaced easily by other Casts. In the end, I just said thiz kind of movie definitely just for fun.\r Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com"

Other than an over-dependence on the introduction of the Chipettes, there's nothing 'wrong' with this sequel that wasn't equally wrong in the original, but it seems to lack the same heart. If you liked the first one, you'll like this one too, but it comes across as a sequel more than a worthy tribute to the source."

A complete waste of your time, don't go near this abomination."

He recovers in the hospital while the Chipmunks are to stay with their aunt and attend school. This seems more like an excuse to send the Chipmunks back home and introduce a new character. Toby who takes the place of Dave ( Jason Lee) as he \"tries\" to take care of the chipmunks. He is filled with poor dialog and serves no real purpose to the story. It was a very poor mistake to use Toby rather than Dave. I would have expected a move like this if it was straight to dvd or Jason Lee not wanting to play the role anymore. One of the biggest issues people may find with this title is copy and paste. The Chipettes find Ian who repeats his actions to them as he did to the Chipmunks in the first movie. Principal Dr. Ruben requests the Chipmunks to help with a music contest to help save the music program. This Squeakquel felt like there should have been more to the entire movie. The overall plot is lacking and the music selection was okay. The only redeeming thing about the entire movie is the Chipettes. They should have been introduced in the 3rd movie while making this one about something else."

With its cliche roles of the smarts, handsome looks, and the charmer; the characters in \"Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel\" are downright old and boring, and even worse as they add three more talking chipmunks with similar personalities as well. If David Cross' character wasn't horrible in the first, his role in the second is very dull and boring as well, with his already cliche character before turning horribly annoying. The plot of the story is obviously kid-friendly, as it takes on the role of high school that hundreds of films have already taken, and is nothing new. Although most kids will enjoy this film, to me, it was a bit to overdone with its annoying and boring plot and character elements, and its tired singing musical with the chipmunk voices."

After my review of \"Avatar\" spoke very positively of the James Cameron film, the last film that I'm reviewing from 2009 is \"Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel,\" the easily inferior sequel to the surprisingly decent 2007 film. While the first film had a few charming and entertaining moments, \"The Squeakquel\" loses those moments, and overall, it's boring, much less fun, less humorous, and the soundtrack is definitely worse here. While it's perfect for the kids (minus one really weird, out-of-place pole-dancing joke), it's overall a poor sequel that I can't really recommend. There are plenty of better family options for the holidays than this film.On a side note that has no impact on the score, you know what's crazy? This film managed to outgross pretty much any-and-all holiday family films released in 2009. \"A Christmas Carol,\" \"Fantastic Mr. Fox,\" \"The Princess and the Frog,\" you name it, this film passed ALL of them. And fun fact: when I went to see \"Avatar,\" for some reason, the people at the theater gave us tickets to this film (which we had already seen, by the way) and, in our desperate attempt to find the theater that was showing \"Avatar\" (which luckily, we found), we walked into 3-4 screenings of this film. How it got that big, I will never know, but regardless, \"The Squeakquel\" is an underwhelming experience at the movies, and you should take your child to something more competent."
