Sure, like all disaster movies, there's plenty of Deus Ex Machina to keep our protagonists safe and sound to the very end, but there's just enough science here to make me think. And disaster movies never make me think, just sigh and roll my eyes.I'd say, as far as big budget disaster movies go, this is the best one of the bunch."

Despite being a successful structural engineer; he has recently moved back home with his wife Allison (Morena Baccarin), and their son Nathan (Roger Dale Floyd).John and Allison are attempting to rebuild their marriage and despite some awkwardness at first they are moving ahead. In the new film \u201cGreenland\u201d life is about to become far more complicated for the Garrity family in the form of a comet that is set to pass very close to earth.The authorities have told the public there is no cause for concern but John notices a large group of military aircraft in the skies shortly before he receives an automated call from Homeland Security telling him to come to an evacuation location with his wife and son.Not sure what to make of the message; things become abundantly clear when a \u201charmless fragment\u201d strikes and destroys a city on live television.With panic setting in the Garrity family head to the evacuation site only to face complications which leave them separated and facing many dangers and obstacles as they attempt to reunite and get to safety before the big chunk hits in two days.The film is very engaging and what really stood out for me was how the film relied on the cast versus an array of special effects and action sequences which are so common for films in the disaster genre.Despite the circumstances the characters were very relatable and the tension of the pending impact helped shape their actions instead of being a countdown to an elaborate array of FX sequences showing cities being devastated. While there is footage of this sort; it is generally confined to news reports versus being the focal points.Butler was very strong in a departure from his usual action oriented parts as a father trying to make things right in a world that is falling apart around him. It was also nice to hear him using his natural accent for a change as well.While some may wonder about the timing of releasing a disaster film at the end of 2020 and during the Holiday Season the film is so engaging that it did not matter to me in the slightest.\u201cGreenland\u201d is a film that came in under the radar in terms of hype and expectation but has delivered an enjoyable and memorable viewing experience that is not to be missed. 4 stars out of 5"

      "text": "Hey streamers after an exciting weekend of movies, I decided to take it down a notch. I said to myself, \"What can I watch that no one is even thinking about? . . . Hmm . . . Greenland!\" The most forgotten part of the world and now, a movie from December that was once in theaters. Greenland stars our favorite Spartan, Gerard Butler, as John Garrity. We follow John as he and his family fight for survival as Earth is in danger from a surprise dangerous comet. John, his estranged wife, and son travel to what they think will be a sanctuary, as cities across the globe are destroyed. The Garrity's become forced to fight the increasingly dangerous society around them. The countdown begins to utter destruction, but will they make it out? I know sounds intriguing right? Let's see how it turned out.First off, who let King Bach in this movie?! He wasn't even that bad either, for what he did. Ok, back to the real. Greenland is \"le turn up\". I mean yes, this is the exact same movie as every other \"the world is ending\", or some catastrophic thing is killing the earth type of movie, but I feel like watching this particular family added value. For some strange reason, I actually cared what happened to the family and that's a good sign. My boy Gerard wasn't overselling anything and I was buying heavy. I could feel myself in his and his wife's shoes throughout the movie. Yes, I may have left his son behind at some point, but I could understand the fight I would have for my own child and wife. And on top of that, I felt there was a genuine nature to scenes in this film. Particularly, in one scene where Mr. 300 is like, \"We aren't taking your child with us! Are you crazy?!\" (not verbatim) But in reality it wasn't because he didn't want to help, it was because he didn't want to hurt the child further in the end. It's an early scene, but really captures the feel of this movie. Now with that said, again this movie is as basic of a story as you can get. We have the world possibly ending, looters, bandits, good people, bad people... blah blah blah. You really have to look for the character interaction to enjoy this flick. And there's a slight feel of World War Z at one point. That being said, the cast fits well together. What doesn't fit is the CGI at times. You'll see the one fire scene where you're like \"this is the fakest looking fire,\" but yet, you still worry that this character may get burned. Same goes for the comets. The comets looked horrible, but resulting explosion and destruction is great.Quiet as it's kept Greenland would've been pretty good to see on the big screen. Not necessary, but a couple of scenes would've been pretty good on the big screen. As far as end of the world scenarios go, Greenland was a pretty solid depiction and worth a big box of fresh streaming popcorn. And you wouldn't even be mad at yourself with a bowl of popcorn during the matinee in theaters."

Well I've never made a critic about anything before, I'm going to start by the bad part of it. Well, its pretty cliche (hang on keep reading) its graphics effects are acceptable but not great, at least this is what I noticed during the movie. On the other hand, the movie is unique, mixing aspects thats remind us of movies like the impossible. As I wrote back in the beginning the movie is cliche, but in its own way, the narrative construction is built so well that keeps you hanging on the edge of your sit all the time. The CGI, may not be so great of course but if you are looking for a great experience, such a great dramatic story, you should definitely give it a try."

Gerard Butler and Morena Baccarin set aside their marital estrangement to travel thru an incredible gauntlet of obstacles to save their marriage and son. Every time they overcome one setback, yet another erupts to make their journey even more challenging (while stretching credibility a bit). Director Ric Roman Waugh, who also worked with Butler on Angel Has Fallen (my review), has crafted an even more gripping action film, while ramping up the emotional moments. Add this harrowing disaster and the fallout (literal and physical) and the result is a highly involving sci-fi survival adventure."

If you've not yet given up on cinema as an art form, we suggest you avoid going anywhere near this movie, much like this entire production avoided any substance that would even faintly move us in any way, in fact much less than that, it didn't even satisfy our already stripped down expactation of merely decent CGI and grand pictures. We're happy to go into detail on what bothered us the most. As that pertains to every single aspect of the movie, we'll just list them in order of how much they disappointed our hearts, insulted our minds and overall tortured our soul.The plot is overall inconsistent, feels rushed and dumbed down, unrealistic and without any depth, rather the opposite, exaggerated and reductive and with it, reducing the characters and the entire dialogue down to a 10 year old's skillset of writing a (disaster) movie; leaving one to question with how many movies an industry can burry its claim to be an art form and stop putting money where it doesn't add any quality, but put up a facade any idiot can see through. I pray for our cast, as we would spirale into depression upon reading the script and try to build a character from nothing through merely method acting and emotions, which in the end failed miserably and left us unattached and almost in a continously cringy state. Any role next to our main cast (the family) was so shallow, that we could only laugh at the irony of them being killed or never seen again after a minute of being either of use for the plot or for a cheap shot at the darkness of human interaction in crisis.Being rushed through a shallow, colourless story, leaving no room for any depth of character throughout the movie, there was no chance to feel for them. Paired with continous inconsistencies, you're left more annoyed by their hardship than anything else, as they added no quality to human development and of what it means to be human in the time of crisis. (SPOILER)They missed their only chance when Butler killed another man in self defense being left in awe, because the entire scene was so random, the fight started on such an insultingly dumb premis and dialogue and ended on a shot of the only useful side character being killed immediatly after giving Butler the most crucial information out of nowhere.Pertaining to everything else: We are no experts. Our minimum requirement for a movie in general, is not feeling like our life's time was stolen, happy to feel even slightly entertained without having to give up on every standard.We were shocked, reading the reviews of the so called critics. Even if each and every one of them were Gerard Butlers closest friends or better yet, family, we would still say you failed him, by being this dishonest about the movie. We cannot believe how low the bar has fallen even for movies of which we expect close to nothing."

Second, the movie is a woke vehicle filled with contrived, virtue signaling clich\u00e9s.  Literally every brown skinned person is \"good\" and \"honorable\" and the white folks are nothing but morally corrupt hillbillies.  And then there's the meteors falling that you wish would blow the whole lot of them to hades.  I truly fear that such terrible filmmaking is becoming the new standard, where authentic character development, good dialogue and subtlety that allows the viewer to feel engaged and THINK, are dead.  Instead, audience is treated like morons that need to have thoughtless clich\u00e9s beaten over their head so they \"get it\". I recently saw \"The Sound of Metal\" and cried because it had been so long since I saw a thoughtful, genuine movie.  More of that please and less of this movies' mindless awfulness."

Yawn!I can take these kinds of movies if they are created and made simply to entertain, and aren't intended to be some moralistic pedantic 'togetherness conquers all' crap...But that's exactly what this film is, one that asks the audience to get invested in characters who are bland and annoying, inside a narrative that (to anyone with even the slightest level of intellect) makes literally no sense.It's par for the course, story-wise....Mass fragment comet predicted to miss Earth instead, at the last moment, is skewed in our direction and predictions come in of an Extinction Level Event (ELE). Main characters (Husband, Wife and 7 year old (Diabetic) Son) are chosen to go to an airforce base for evacuation as husband is a high level civil engineer.However, the son loses his Insulin in the car, forcing Husband to go back for it leaving Wife and Son at the base. But, Son's Diabetes was only very recently diagnosed and prevents wife/son from getting on plane......So, all three are tasked with going to wife's father's house... And from there to Canada to get a plane to Greenland where the military planes are heading...Will they make it? Of course they do, but we have to spend 90+ minutes watching them do it.The film isn't truly terrible, it barrels along at a steady enough pace. The problem is the aforementioned presupposition that everyone in the audience will simply believe the scientific nonsense the film requires them to.Nothing makes sense and, above all, the ending is just ludicrous.Most of the run-time of the film revolves around making sure husband brings along a three month supply of insulin... Thus, if the family come out of the bunker after nine months... Son should have been long dead, but of course he isn't! Also.. Nine(!!) months for the particulates in the atmosphere to dissipate? Nine months after a Nine mile wide chunk of rock hits Western Europe at several thousand miles per hour! Even the grossly stupid must have realised such an impact would have caused a Nuclear Winter that would have lasted decades, if not centuries!"

Many scenes (and perhaps the entire movie) could apply to any global threat.

Ceci \u00e9tant pos\u00e9, Butler et sa famille (et d\u2019autres s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9es, tri\u00e9es sur le volet \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il para\u00eet) doivent se magner le cul pour \u00e9vacuer vers le Groenland !Le film d\u00e9crit assez bien la panique, l\u2019urgence et le chaos de la catastrophe catastrophique mais nous sommes n\u00e9anmoins r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement catastroph\u00e9s devant d\u2019abord un temps d\u2019exposition trop long, puis par une guimauve ridicule et trop pr\u00e9sente.Les incoh\u00e9rences et les raccourcis sont aussi beaucoup trop nombreux et un manque de rythme se fait aussi sentir, r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement : on baille devant les p\u00e9rip\u00e9ties et les clich\u00e9s et franchement le diab\u00e8te du gamin nous les casse tr\u00e8s s\u00e9v\u00e8rement (il parasite les trois quarts du film). En d\u00e9finitive, on finit cette daube en avance rapide, et m\u00eame l\u00e0, on a du mal."
