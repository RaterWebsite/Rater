It\u2019s a really bland thriller which has some plots that you can see coming a mile away.  Anyone that is familiar with Dan Brown will know that his stories tend to have very good build up and promise, but then a poor pay off, and there is no difference here, in fact it almost feels like it\u2019s been taken to the outer degree and once again, the big problem is that the screenplay writers are pretty much forced to make more adaptations than the novel, cutting very little out of it.  Expect the characters to talk a lot of exposition in a way that is fine in a novel, but does not work in a screenplay.  I would only recommend it if you enjoyed the Da Vinci Code or Angels and Demons, if you didn\u2019t skip it, this isn\u2019t going to change your mind."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Racing to stop men with bad intention!Compared to the first two films, it took a long time for the third film. But I expected 'The Lost Symbol' before this one. I don't know why they skipped that book from adapting which was done in the last minutes by the production house. My guess is it might be a controversial as the first one, or simply not good enough for the cinematic version. Anyway, this film was not as good as previous two. Once again, it was directed by Ron Howard and Tom Hanks returned as professor Robert Langdon. Two hours long, but very fast storytelling, non-stop adventures.This is another tale in the series about fighting against the men who believes in the ancient text that's written about to curb the issue the human would face in the future, which is now. After waking up without any memory, professor Langdon with the help of a young woman escape from an assassin. In result, they look for the reason why and whoever behind it wants them dead. So it's not a good story, but entertaining film. Especially if you like action-adventure- suspense.Nice cast, including Hanks and Jones. The other supporting cast was not bad either. Like always, it's a European adventure, particularly in Venice and neighbouring countries. Some cool secret places, might be the settings, but awesome. Since this part was not received well, I wonder the next one, 'Origin' would be made or not. Even before that, this time I expect 'The Lost Symbol' first to hit if they want to continue with the film series. This is not a film to recommend, but not bad for watching it once.6/10"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I have a confession. I liked the Dan Brown books and honestly, I don\u2019t really understand the amount of stick they get. He is no Umberto Eco mind you but he is hardly Stephenie Meyer. The other confession? I have not liked the movie adaptations.The first was one was okay mind you but Angel\u2019s and Demons was the kind of train wreck that really requires Mike and the robots to enjoy.Hope springs eternally and while director Ron Howard has certainly had some misses recently star Tom Hanks is always a dependable watch. I was expecting a decent movie and got a surprisingly good one. Even more shocking Ron Howard's direction is one of the strengths this time.First off though let me get this out of the way. The story is pulpy illogical nonsense. The twist in the middle can be seen from space and the twist, in the end, makes absolutely zero sense. (Still better than Angels and Demons Illuminati scavenger hunt, however.)What works though is the visuals. Ron Howard creates visions of hell that are actually effective and creative. The travelogue element is beautiful and unlike Angels and Demons (God I hated that movie) it is in daylight so one can actually see and enjoy the scenery. (Angels and Demons didn\u2019t have permission to film in the Vatican so a lot of the scenes were at night, in the rain with all the lights turned off to hide this fact.)As for the cast, Irrfan Khan steals every scene he is in, Tom Hanks is dependable as usual. Sidse Babett Knudsen is dull and has zero chemistry with her costars, Omar Sy almost gives an OJ Simpson Naked gun performance that seems like it should be in a Pink Panther film, and Felicity Jones does that pixie eyes thing so all is forgiven there (No actress could really make her character work so she gets points for looking cute while flailing around.)Overall a fun film with surprisingly good visuals, some decent performances, and a silly story.

I liked the colorful supporting actors, especially Ana Ularu as the ruthless assassin Vayentha. She has nearly no dialogue and very few scenes, but makes a powerful impression. Usually I don't buy the Hollywood actresses in 'tough parts', but she was tough as nails. I would have loved to see more of her.

I saw but don't remember the first two films based on the books by Dan Brown and this is the most forgettable of all, that is if you can even remember what the plot was about though it was again a case of a man wanting to rule the world and the good people who want to stop him.\r Tom Hanks, not being a Tom Cruise, doesn't go around fighting 5 people at a time and winning the fight and, in fact, gets beaten up a few times, but, yes, recovers pretty quickly as only movie heroes can. At 60 he isn't running as fast or as much as he use to but the one thing Hanks has is that tremendous likability that always makes him a winner in any movie he is in.\r There is a strong supporting cast made up of young, middle aged and old actors doing a professional job but, alas, all for nothing. I am a firm believer of checking your logic at the door when coming to see an action movie but the screen writer David Koepp and director Ron Howard seem to be deyfing you to follow the film. Yes, someone wants to eliminate half the population, as he feels we are overpopulated, releasing a virus and there are a load of red herrings and some people are out to stop the virus from being released.\r Three things going for the movie are the soundtrack by Howard Shore, the production design by Peter Wenham and the cinematography by Salvatore Totino in Florence, Venice and Istanbul but that's not enough for a good movie.\r If you haven't seen Tom Hanks in \"Scully\" then skip \"inferno\" or save your money to see \"Moonlight\" next week and \"Loving\" the week after!"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Great movie.

I get the whole contrivance of starting with the lead's amnesia, but at a certain point they run the risk of losing the audience which I believe they did here.  Needless to probably say, it goes down the typical over formulated Hollywood route in due time and turns one big boring through the motions clich\u00e9.\r A couple details to point out:  there is an African actor and an Indian actor both of whose English is so freaking incoherent that they need sub-titles or should have been over-dubbed!  Diversity of casting is fine and the real world, but INTELLIGIBILITY in movies outweighs this bs always!  It's surprising someone of Ron Howard's stature let this by.  And all the handheld camera work ( just barely passes the subjective POV test) is not welcome.  Please Ron, do not be tempted to try to stylize up and ride current \"hip\" trends which are detrimental to a film overall and ultimately will not fare well down the road and be looked at as dated someday.\rPretty colors and lights in shallow deprh of field shots that appear acquired with newer DSLR type sensor tech makes for \"cool\" looking visuals, but the audience for these level blockbusters will never ever be satisfied by those touches.  Putting new smaller cameras on planes and vehicles for angles never before seen is fine (just about nothing is unseen at this point though, especially with this replication of GoPro tactics), but is about 1/100th the importance of story, structure, logic, pacing, and performance in these kinds of large endeavors.

If I had known then what I know now, I would have skipped the cinema altogether and waited until the movie is out on Netflix.The BookI listened to the book version earlier this year and it took me months to finish. It was just really not that good. Something about the story kept me from putting it aside and listen to something else in between several times. The story just drags on and on. Dan Brown really tries hard to recreate the success of the Da Vinci Code. But he doesn't quite get there. I think he needs to get away from the Robert Langdon stories and come up with something new.I listened to Deception Point awhile back and that was brilliant. It is one of his earlier books, pre Langdon era. I reckon after The Da Vinci Code it was a logical step to keep the momentum going. Angels and Demons and The Lost Symbol where still okay, although already declining in that order.  I may need to take a break from Dan Brown for a while. Maybe I start enjoying his books again in the future.With all of that in mind I was wondering why I was so eager to watch the movie Inferno in the first place. I suppose the answer is I read the books and I saw the other movies. Might as well keep going.Mixed FeelingsDon't get me wrong, I like the idea of the story. There is something intriguing about it. Why I had such a hard time finishing it I don't know. Maybe they're we're just too many twists and turns. The momentum got lost along the way. Movies are never as detailed as books; how could they be, and that partly appealed to me in this case. Plus I really do enjoy watching Tom Hanks. The previews for the movie looked halfway interesting and that settled it for me in the end. So, when I finally got the chance I went ahead and booked my ticket.With all that in mind however, I didn't have very high expectorations for the movie and thus I was not disappointed. It is by no means terrible, but it is definitely not the best movie ever made.The\u00a0MovieTom Hanks once again resumes to role of Robert Langdon, a Harvard university professor, who specialises in religious iconology and symbology. In this instalment he finds himself waking up with a head wound in a hospital in Florence, Italy with no idea of what happened. He does not know why he even is in Florence nor does he remember how he got there.From here on the story develops pretty close to the book for a while. The ending has been changed to conform more to a Hollywood style finish, which is a shame. It's a disease in the movie industry to change stories, sometimes almost beyond recognition. It didn't go quite that far with Inferno but still. I rather liked the book ending.The StoryRobert Langton wakes up in the hospital in Florence Italy struck with a head wound and partial amnesia. He has no recall of the past two days and no idea how he got to Florence and why he is there. When a fake police officer attempts to show to him he is rescued by his doctor Sienna Brooks. They find a bio hazard tube in his belongings that turns out to be a projector for the scene of Dante\u2019s Inferno. Together Langdon and Brooks race to put the pieces of the puzzle together to find out who wants to kill him and what is behind those strange visions that Langdon has. In the end it come down to saving the world from a major catastrophe. We would not expected anything less.It's fascinating how the movie incorporates the weird dreams and flashbacks that Langdon has. That part was very well done and is as disorienting to the viewer as it must have been for the character himself.Overall, Inferno is\u00a0not a terrible movie, but in my opinion its also nothing to get excited about. I guess that is why it has taken me quite a while to write the review."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Le fameux prof \u00e9sot\u00e9rique reprend du service en la personne du tr\u00e8s estimable Tom Hanks, flanqu\u00e9 ici d'une jolie b\u00e9casse qui me disait vaguement quelque chose... mignonne sans \u00eatre vraiment jolie avec cette serpill\u00e8re sur la t\u00eate en guise de coiffure, j'ai mis du temps \u00e0 la reconna\u00eetre... pour me rendre compte qu'elle tenait le premier r\u00f4le dans le Star Disney Wars, celui qui sent le poisson : Rogue One !

In the earlier minutes, I get puzzled by a lot of things, and sadly, I just understand it in the middle of the movie. How stupid I am or I\u2019m supposed to be felt like this as the moviemaker intended? The movie is about a professor, Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) had puzzled by an amnesia attack and tried to figure out about any event that actually makes him a crucial world-changer \u2013 involved in a pandemic attack idea. So, maybe it is okay for me to get puzzled caused the main chars are also puzzled lol.In my personal POV, I didn\u2019t expect anything and I\u2019m very ready to get surprised by this movie. Overall, it's satisfied me and I\u2019ve had a lil bit surprised. The pros of this movie are the insightful knowledge, great movie plot, and systematics narration. I really like how insightful this movie is with various actual knowledge \u2013 science, history, and pandemics. I\u2019ve been triggered to do my own research about all of that. I\u2019ve felt getting smarter even though I didn\u2019t really get it lol. The other pros are this movie had a tricky plot which is amazing, and systematically great narration because as a person who knows nothing, I could catch up for this movie sequel. However, the movie's cons are the plot transition felt too puzzled without a simpler explanation. It felt kinda boring caused of their long explanation to solve the main char's puzzled memory. It's getting more boring because of lack of emotional quality, I didn't feel any intense at any intense moment. Lastly, the movie ending seems didn\u2019t satisfying enough and the audiovisual quality is just standard, followed by the quality of the acting performances.Overall, it is great to watch as movie consumption during the Covid-19 pandemic. Inferno really gives insightful knowledge and entertaining value. But beware yourself, just please don\u2019t think about conspiracy theories about pandemic was actually purposed to be made. If Covid-19 was really like that, I\u2019d definitely believe whoever made it\u2019s gonna chased over the centuries. LOL.
