The movie also showcased some San Francisco landmarks, an area we were going to visit the following week."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "It's big and it rarely takes a moment of pause - San Andreas is a massive disaster movie that has been done several times before, but it doesn't displace the awe that comes with destruction on such incredible scale.  You won't find any Oscar performances here, just a roller coaster ride that carries enough twists and turns, ups and downs, to satisfy the thrill seeker in its intended audiences.  The best part, from a science standpoint, is that these aren't just mindless earthquakes but sequential seismic events that are all a part of the fault-line that so many people in the Western United States are watching closely for the biggest disaster moment of the last century.  Whether or not it will be quite THIS bad is anyone's guess, but San Andreas does a lot to walk through some of the scenarios that people might fact should something this horrific ever strike near home.  Anyone walking into this should know what to expect and, if you do, you shouldn't be disappointed."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "I'll take a wild guess and say the writers spent no more than a day on the script because the best way to describe anything but the action sequences is pathetic.

Oh and after Mad Max Fury Road this year, all these CGI overload which gets bigger and bigger with the years seems just so unimpressive (if used right it is great, but lately it is being too much and the only thing going on in so many of these blockbusters, for example in most of the comic book movies, which have literally nothing else going on for them)."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "As a disaster movie, San Andreas works better than some of its recent, big-budget predecessors. That's not to say that it's a great film or anything close to it. The plot is bog standard for the genre, and some of the dialogue is so predictable that you're likely to get there before the actors at least half the time.\r But it looks terrific. If disaster porn isn't your thing, you'll probably be bored, but then why on earth are you watching a Dwayne Johnson film named after a fault line in the first place? Mr. Johnson is, by the way, as fun and charismatic as ever."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "The film begins with a scene of a careless driver who seems to have no regard for her safety and well being, or that of others. If you were in the mood to search for deeper meanings in a supposedly dumb action flick this is almost a subtle introduction to the story. The film's disaster earthquake that wrecks everything could be taken as symbolic for Ray and Emma's divorce and the damage that the separation of families does to children.\r That said, this is about as deep as the story goes. As is typical of action movies the action takes the front seat instead of the plot and in San Andreas it is just exciting enough to make you ignore the plot weaknesses. If anything San Andreas could have done with less unnecessary back story and cringe worthy dialogue.\r Particularly the worst part would have to be the Malory Talk where it gets all dramatic as Ray is talking with Emma about their dead daughter. It is just so out of tone with the rest of the film. And of course I did not think for one second that Blake was actually going to die.\r Overall San Andreas is an enjoyable action flick that is fun to watch but nothing too special that you would have to rush to the cinema to see it."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "\"San Andreas\" 10 Scale Rating: 3.0 (Bad) ...\r The Good: As expected from the trailers, the effects were well done. The scale of the destruction was amazing to see and capture the imagination. As with most disaster films, it was entertaining to see landmarks destroyed in creative ways.\r The Bad: I don't expect award winning performances from big budget disaster films, but I do expect performances that are at least somewhat decent. I didn't get that here. Dwayne Johnson's undeniable charisma usually makes up for a bad film, but he was wooden and stiff here. His character was poorly written and everything about him was cliche. The rest of the cast was even worse. They tried to cram in personalities and back stories for everyone, but they felt like an afterthought and I didn't care about a single character in the film. Lastly, the film was full of comedic moments that were not meant to be comedic. In fact, every escape and \"near miss\" action moment caused me to laugh out loud at the absurdity of it all. Epic destruction is all around, yet our leads consistently overcome impossible odds and survive unscathed. You expect and accept this from a film like this to some extent, but they took it way too far and included far too many of these laughable moments."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "This is a fun disaster movie, with all the thrills and frills!

I'm giving a 9 to make up for the haters."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "San Andreas is big, loud, cheesy, and filled with clich\u00e9s but boy Is it a fun movie.  The film revolves around veteran Ray Gaines played by Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson (The Scorpion King, The Fast and the Furious) who after years of serving in Afghanistan returns and works as a helicopter pilot for the Los Angeles Fire Department.  As the movie continues we learn that Ray Gaines is taking some time off from work in order to take his daughter Blake played by Alexandra Daddario (Percy Jackson, Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3D) to her first week of college. However, Ray\u2019s plans get interrupted by the destruction of the Hoover Dam, forcing him and his Rescue Team to go to work.  Upon his arrival, he finds that various earthquakes are starting to happen all over the San Andreas Fault that is affecting the entire state of California. As the earthquakes continue to occur, Ray\u2019s ex-wife played by actress Carla Gugino (Watchmen, Night in the Museum, Sin City) and his daughter Blake become endangered, therefore he must come to their rescue. Along with these characters, we also have Lawrence a seismologist, played by Paul Giamatti (Sideways, 12 Years A Slave) who plays a key role in the film. Lawrence\u2019s main goal is to inform the citizens of California to evacuate and find shelter during this disaster.\r As a film, San Andreas is not a masterpiece by any means, but I can assure you that it is an absolute blast to watch on a big screen. The effects team behind this movie did an excellent job bringing the disaster onto the big screen. A lot of the destruction scenes looked sharp, especially the Tsunami scene that \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson goes against in his boat.\r As for the performances in the film, they were not as bad as I expected.  Dwayne Johnson steals the show like always thanks to his charismatic attitude and presence on screen.  And let\u2019s be honest, if he was not in San Andreas, the movie would be a complete disaster. So props to Mr. Johnson for that. As for the rest of the cast, no one really stood out to me. One of the major problems seen consistently throughout the film was the horrible script written by Carlton Cuse (Lost, Bates Motel) and Andre Fabrizio (Vice, The Prince). Thankfully there were times that the horrible screenplay was forgotten, due to Dwayne\u2019s charm.\r Overall, San Andreas has proven to be time well spent at the movies. To truly enjoy this one, you simply have to make sure to turn off your brain, let go, and enjoy this disastrous wild ride.\r Final Score: 7/10"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "It was a solid experience, a couple hitches in the plot and the actions done by Johnson.

The Rock actually gave a good performance, and Alexandria Daddario is a hottie whom I will keep track of in future movies.  Paul Giammatti and the science of the movie's script were both credible and spot-on.  The visual effects will likely be nominated for an Oscar in 2016.  As for the 3D, it is totally immersive...I felt like I was there in the cities during a real earthquake at times.  Compared to the Roland Emmerich film, \"2012\", \"San Andreas\" effects were different but equal to \"2012\".  As an earthquake disaster film, \"San Andreas\" shoots to the top as one of the best.  Being a published disaster film novelist, I was completely entertained.  Sure, I will admit that some lines of dialogue were corny and logic and credibility were tested at times, yet director Brad Peyton was not trying to present a James Cameron \"Titanic\"-type masterpiece.  His goal of generating realism, eye-popping visuals, and an overall good time at the movies was met.

If you enjoy things that most movies are required to have (like story, believable characters, and plot points that make sense) you most likely will not. There is nothing even remotely original or interesting about this movie and if you've ever seen any disaster movie before then you already know how the \"family dynamic\" story played out. Emphasis on \"played out\".\r There is a certain amount of cheese and silliness that I am willing to take in my action movies but the sheer amount of contempt and disdain that San Andreas shows for its audience overshadows anything that could have otherwise been enjoyable. The dialogue is perfunctory at best and the plot points are so completely ludicrous that you feel kind of like an idiot just suspending your disbelief to go along for the ride. This movie is designed for those who don't want to think while watching their movies. If you are quite content not using your brain whatsoever, then by all means go check out San Andreas. However, if you find cookie-cutter characters who always make exactly the right decisions based on no information and sheer luck then you'll probably find this movie as insufferable as I did. And I'm a Rock fan! But not even that can make me okay with this stupid, horrible, insulting excuse for a movie. All of the positive reviews for this movie (which I'm shocked by, frankly) seem to have been written by teenagers who have never seen special effects before. Because they're actually NOT THAT GREAT! I mean, if you want to watch The Rock boating through what could be a very cool video game background, then you can see that here. And yeah, the earthquake stuff looks cool.

I know that the script is not the strongest but the visuals are great, I wouldn't recommend the 3D though, I thought that it didn't need to be in that format.

The inept script for \"San Andreas\" has less verbal fireworks than your average made for TV movie and possibly less than a tupperware party. In a nutshell, \"San Andreas'\" completely brain-dead script focuses on the \"original\" story of a steroid+collage infused couple -- who are \"nearly\" divorced --being swept together by massive catastrophe. That weary chestnut is complimented by a bevy of equally \"original\" characters like cowardly rich guys; moronic youngster who fall in love within 5 seconds, and knowing scientists who take hours to start shouting \"Take cover\": This movie has everything you want in an utterly cliched movie and more. One of the most laughably bad scripts I've had to sit though in a long time. And people around here poke fun at \"Interstellar?\" This is a reminder how we need to fall down on our knees and praise movies like \"Interstellar\" that at least try to say something smart. At least if the effects in \"San Andreas\" were worth waiting out the doldrums, it might have made sitting through the movie worthwhile, but they weren't even that good. Just average computer bits showering down all over the place.  And you know the pace: SPFX -- talk -- SPFX -- talk --- and talk -- and talk. And what talk. Who writes scripts like \"San Andreas\" -- some rich producer's wife while she's having her nails done, chatting on the phone and watching a Lifetime movie? Once can only sit and scoff at the jello for lines the actors are given to work with. Even the mass of muscle known as The Rock looked weak and helpless about making this dog work. Even worse, it manages to make the smartest actor in Hollywood, Paul Giamatti look like an eyeball rolling puffin -- whose magical computer model predicts the end of the West Coast but doesn't tell him to at least put a call into a disaster agency to share the news.

Meanwhile Paul Giamatti, along with Archie Punjabi's news team, try to understand the earthquake's movements and warn the city in order to save lives, with cliche dialogue that is now expected from these kind of films. San Andreas keeps a focus on these characters, with some time for Ioan Gruffudd and his strange sudden shift from likeable step-dad to a cowardly survivor who meets a timely death. Kylie Minogue makes a cameo... but to zero affect.\r The silly but exhilarating action sequences are worth the price of admission, especially the boat race over the tsunami and destruction of the Golden Gate Bridge.

Using the same premise from many disaster movies such as 2012 and even Volcano from years before, San Andreas delivers a more superior spectacle. However, it also copies many clich\u00e9 elements. Cheesy script to build up tension and assortments of convenient plot devices are scattered through the story. This is a movie designed to entertain with over-the-top visual, and with welcomed addition of Dwayne Johnson as the lead, it succeeds in doing so.\r In a streak of unfortunate geological events, California is in immediate danger of massive earthquakes. Ray (Dwayne Johnson) is a pilot of rescue helicopter who must journey across the quivering land to save his family. The calamity serendipitously offers a chance of reuniting the estranged father as he proves how far he's willing to go for his wife and daughter. This theme has been done so many times, Day After Tomorrow and 2012 comes to mind. Luckily, The Rock is a demanding on-screen presence, with charisma and superhero physique, he's a good cast as the savior type.\r The script offers back stories, while not all of them pan out, The Rock does his best to convey his character. Another perspective is presented by Paul Giamatti as Lawrence, a professor who investigates the incoming catastrophe. He's here to deliver partially scientific explanation to the audience. Ironically, his role is quite predictable with foreshadowing comments to get the momentum rolling.\r Visually, San Andreas is breathtaking. Expect tons of falling buildings witnessed in extraordinary viewpoints and multiple set pieces to awe the audience. There's one particularly amazing continuous shot that follows characters as they weave back and forth as everything collapses around them. It will not disappoint those who come for high octane explosive scenes.\r It does have several problems like predecessors of the genre. Some of the sequences are highly implausible, most notably with the characters having plot armor and impeccable timing. Dialogues are not always charming as only few moments of the human drama are thoroughly engaging. It then eventually sets up for resolution analogy or the inspirational survival gimmick.

Dwayne Johnson in this movie pulled off a action hero very well and at least he had fun with the role and he didn't take it way way too seriously.\r Now it comes to disaster movies you got to have good visual effect's and for the most part this movie did have good effect's. It really helped to set the scale of a big disaster and it give the action scenes that solid concrete impact that a movie like this needed.\r Now for problems: When I said some of the CG was good, well there was some noticeable and fake looking CG at times. The opening of the movie which involves a car crashing and hanging off a deep hole in the background. Some of the effect's worked and some didn't.\r The character's in the movie are so freaking retard and I don't mean Dwayne Johnson, Paul Giamatti and Carla Gugino character's, I mean the supporting character's. This isn't really a spoiler for the movie but these a scene where Dwayne Johnson daughter played by Alexandra Daddario, she's stuck in the middle of this disaster and then she finds out about a tsunami that's on it's way due to all of the earthquake's, and what does she do? goes into a unfinished building that's not even close to done and she thinks that would save her from the tsunami, nope the building couldn't hold the power of a giant freaking waving that's more power then other wave (The movie made that point out about the tsunami and earthquake's) and it starts flood the whole building and soon falls over.\r I got nothing against Alexandra Daddario. I've seen her do a solid performance in TV shows and movies, but she wasn't all that great in the movie, actually she was pretty bad. She kept doing that boring looking face even when this big disaster is happening around her.\r Overall San Adreas is a enjoyable action movie. As I said before it's not flawless but it's better then most disaster movies that we got today. I thinking if this movie came out in the 90's this would have been a smash hit and this could have been the next Independence Day, just think about it."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I was torn between a 7 & 8 rating but went with the higher due to the Rock's role. There are many tense action scenes to keep you alert.  The cinematography was fantastic and the story was believable. The ending was a bit predictable thus reducing my rating. Overall worth going to see."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "There's nothing to say about this movie...visually spectacular and \"somewhat\" entertaining but with a lazy and superficial script that gives ZERO development to the characters to follow this earthquake journey. Even Dwayne Johnson's charisma is not worth of our money and time but well, we already knew what would be this movie, a Hollywood dumb disaster movie. What surprises me is why so many people watched this poop..."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I truly enjoyed this film. Has a bit of the same feel as 2012 especially in the effects department but still a good film. Loved Duane Johnson. He stood out; not because he looked great in the wet grey tee. I would recommend this film."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "The Rock and company give convincing performances and are likable. The effects are very good. Just enough character development is provided to give the stunts some real heft. Recommended."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "What more can you say... The Rock and a Disaster movie!!!\r It had all you need and some more.Plus in 3D, wow!!!!!!!\r I can't wait till it comes out on Blu Ray..."}], "recommendations": ["into_the_storm", "poseidon", "skyscraper", "independence_day_resurgence", "volcano", "hercules", "lockout", "jumper", "bloodshot", "the_meg", "battleship", "seventh_son", "geostorm", "rampage", "national_treasure_book_of_secrets", "edge_of_tomorrow", "xxx_return_of_xander_cage", "infinite", "transformers_dark_of_the_moon", "angel_has_fallen", "pompeii", "clash_of_the_titans", "the_guardian", "transporter_3", "teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles"]}
