You are left with interpreting the director\u2019s failed metaphor on suburban life being like in a vivarium that has no real freedom, and the  clinical indifference of the alien zoo keepers ( that you learn nothing about ) as a stand in for society itself.  Stay away, a waste of 2 hours that has zero entertainment value. Slower and more boring than the worst documentary you can think of. This films only purpose is to feed the ego of whatever \u201cartist\u201d is responsible for this trash. I think I spent more time writing this review than the director did in making this film.Very disappointed that Jessie Eisenberg decided to be in such a film."

However, there\u2019s a certain serendipity to the timing, with Finnegan crafting a story that is wonderfully bleak, totally unnerving, and incredibly prescient for the times.For those who are curious, the word \u201cvivarium\u201d refers to a place such as a laboratory where animals or plants are kept under conditions simulating their natural environment so that they can be observed, typically for research.While Jesse Eisenberg and Imogen Poots represent the proverbial labs rats in this mystery-horror-thriller, it\u2019s the impotency of adulthood and cracks in modern society that fall squarely under Finnegan\u2019s keen eye and sharp filmmaking.  Covid-19 has already dimmed a lot of light in this world.  If at all possible, don\u2019t let \u2018Vivarium\u2019 be yet another example.  Stream it, spread the word, and support the project any way you can."

Conversely, I've never particularly enjoyed Jesse Eisenberg's acting efforts and I think I actually avoid his work if I can - but, Vivarium provides some of his best efforts and I think I may need to adjust my thinking in that regard.  Regardless, I completely understand casting Poots for her role - but, Eisenberg seems to be a poor choice for his role in my estimation.So, if you spent time in your freshman dorm room discussing things like nihilism - you will probably enjoy this film.  If you do not know what nihilism is - you will probably not enjoy this film.Vivarium has a very straight forward, uncomplicated science fiction, horror plot.  Nothing wrong with that - but, I don't think I can rate it higher than a 7 given its simplicity.  If you owned an \"ant farm\" when you were a child, you probably know what a vivarium is.  If you catch the bird-nest scenes at the beginning of the film you will understand the premise of the film.I enjoyed the film and would recommend that the potential thinking-viewer will want to try it out.  If you are looking for light, escapist diversion - you will want to look elsewhere.Likewise, if you are an individual who requires all/most plot lines to resolve to some definitive end point and/or you do not deal with the reality of uncertainty - you will want to avoid Vivarium."

I just generally don't like movies that end by having asked more questions that it answered. This movie answers a few questions, but asks hundreds.With that said, I can appreciate how it sort of puts \"human everyday life\" down to a very simple recipe. In doing so, it underlines how important the tiny differences in our day-to-day life is - they make life interesting. To be content means enjoying those differences. Too little is not enough, as clearly portrayed in this movie. So I guess it underlines the need to hit that balance between too little and too much.2020 was too much."

      "text": "It's interesting to understand that the various interpretations this movie can have will vary depending on the viewer, but irrevocably its conclusion is still the same and that's the key element of this story.Vivarium is a kind of lost episode from The Twilight Zone. A tale about being trapped in an existential circle over which you simply have no control, or if you came to believe that you had it, now you have to face reality and accept the role that life has imposed on you.Something the two main characters end up confronting once they surrender to the reality that has been imposed on them.Vivarium isn't a subtle film and yes, it's more confusing than explicit and both its second act and conclusion don't feel satisfactory, but in my personal interpretation and the reason why I give it three stars is that that final path is precisely the bleak moral of the allegory and the obvious disappointment that life can bring when it binds you to an established social role from which you cannot escape and after all the work you will simply die and the ones whom you raised will only repeat that cycle."

It has a spooky, unsettling feel to it. I felt there were some unanswered questions - where did they get there groceries from, if their truly trapped in the same street with only houses as far as the eye can see, for example?.If your not ok with loud, long, prolonged shrieks then this film isn't for you. Also, it becomes distinctly more unsettling and surreal towards the end, with a lot of emphasis on light and colour - one plot element reminded me of 'Being John Malkovich'. It also made me think of 'The Stepford Wives'. By the very end, I felt it was a bit of a 'mind eff' type film. I'm not sure I'd say its particularly good but its certainly not a pointless film - its quirky and definitely not perfect - perhaps somewhat memorable, though not entirely in the best of ways maybe, I'm going for this rating as I thought the cast did well and the visual effects aren't bad. If your into claustrophobic, somewhat spooky mystery type films, then this is likely worth your time but it won't suit everyone."

      "text": "If I hadn\u2019t been aware that Vivarium was going to have a Cuckoo story, the literal cuckoo pushing baby birds out of their nests at the beginning followed by the navel gazing scene of a girl asking why a cuckoo would do that really drove it home. Vivarium is not subtle about its imagery. One of the most distinctive things about this movie, in fact, is its blas\u00e9 attitude toward the clich\u00e9s of this decades\u2019 horror films. Tom (played by an inexplicably unaccented Jesse Eisenberg) digs (spoiler) his own grave, Gemma (played by national treasure and future star of the live action adaptation of Y the Last Man, Imogen Poots) falls into the role of Giving Tree.The Giving TreeWriter and director Lorcan Finnegan spends a lot of his movie waxing poetic about the horrors of suburbia and gender roles, actualizing the alienation and resentment young parents feel toward their child in every interaction between Tom and It, but rarely with a point. defection in the couple is broadcast fairly early in the story, which makes for a somewhat hollow script as the two characters with the most self-knowledge cease conversing. Vivarium\u2018s greatest contribution to the horror genre is in its imitations. The way the Young Boy parrots the language of his caregivers in that otherworldly voice, the way that Martin\u2019s sales pitch feels so oddly expressive and staged, and his borderline mocking impression of Gemma\u2019s clich\u00e9 response to getting pregnant are oddball moments of drama and humor.Friend and I spent some time afterwards trying to nail down what didn\u2019t work about the third act, and generally I think it\u2019s worth a discussion about what structures of cuckoo stories work and which ones don\u2019t, which might be more interesting than the movie itself. It feels like the things that we like about the composition of cuckoos, these monsters, whose power comes from their ability to shapeshift into innocent or beloved characters in our lives, is that their power extends only insofar as they are able to play convincing copies. The moment that Coraline\u2019s Other Mother shows her button eyes, that the spider-like dream-dwelling villain of Terry Pratchett\u2019s I Shall Wear Midnight series loosens its grip on the illusion, the protagonist is able to regain control. The story structure of a cuckoo narrative should follow something like: 1) the protagonists don\u2019t notice the cuckoo, 2) discover a discrepancy, 3) attempt to trap/kill it, and 4) fail or succeed. In the empowering version of the story, take It Follows for instance, the children succeed. There\u2019s still lots of room for scares and failure along the way, but the audience feels the thrill of the victim\u2019s empowerment as they learn more about the cuckoos physical limitations. Ditto this for a story like Stephen King\u2019s It, another classic cuckoo story.I\u2019m not saying that there can\u2019t be entertaining stories where cuckoos are successful\u2013I\u2019d offer China Mi\u00e9ville\u2019s Perdido Street Station as an example of a situation where the success of the cuckoo is how the author subverts our expectations and increases the emotional stakes of the story\u2013but I think that the means by which the cuckoo succeeds need to be carefully considered, and maybe roughly equivalent with the ability of the victim, in order for the film to feel exciting. The discovery of how well the spider\u2019s web is constructed is not sufficient entertainment for the fly (or the audience). Vivarium is very much about revealing a neat, little web that two unsuspecting flies have been caught in, and as a metaphor for buying in to consumerist culture, it feels, as Friend put it, like \u201cdated critique.\u201dUsually, I have some recommended reading. I think that this week, I\u2019m going to draw your attention away from the director\u2019s reflection of his own genius in the time of quarantine."

      "text": "Hey Streamers! This week we got straight up depressed and watched the first thing in our watchlist. Vivarium, you're up to bat. We weren't too picky, and we'd heard the movie was \"interesting\". The synopsis of Vivarium goes as follows: a young couple looking for the perfect home find themselves trapped in a mysterious labyrinth-like neighborhood of identical houses. I know that was absolutely horrifying for you millennials out there and I think that's the point. Let's get to it.First, this movie reminds me of a little diddy I used to love. A cult classic, if you will:\"I have a blue house with a blue windowBlue is the color of all that I wearBlue are the streets and all the trees are tooI have a girlfriend and she is so blue... Blue are the feelings that live inside meI'm blue da ba dee da ba daaDa ba dee da ba daa, da ba dee da ba daa, da ba dee da ba daaDa ba dee da ba daa\" (\"Blue (Da Ba Dee)\" by Eiffel 65... If I were green I would die, If i were green i would die.Why do I say that you ask? Well as the poster and description suggest, the maze of homes and interior of homes is just a green bundled mess. Eiffel 65 would've been disgusted and shocked by this green anomaly. The setting of the film is basic yet simultaneously complex. How will our protagonists get out? Are they alone? Why was this house so cheap? I know you house hunters out there will ask the same question after watching. Either way, the setting of the film sets that freaky atmosphere.Second, we have the cast. Some of us love Jesse Eisenberg and others are not so high on him. This role is in no way one of his better one and, in fact, I think the movie really missed out on using him better. He's got more range in acting ability than the director, Lorcan Finnegan, allowed him to portray in this movie. Should've let him go full Social Network or Luthor. As for Imogen Poots, she was \"just alright for me dog\". She definitely hit the range of emotions here but her character was the \"poots\". I don't know if that was on purpose or not. The real star of the movie was my man, Martin. No, not Lawrence. The character Martin, while weird and strange is the only thing worth watching in the film. How will Martin act now? And why are these fools even following him to an open house? But I digress.Finally, the movie isn't really about the characters or the setting as much as the meaning of everything together. Where the film lacks in storyline creativity, it makes up with in storyline and movie detail analysis. My wife, Trip and I sat here on the phone for an hour talking about what certain images meant or were trying to represent in society. From what we gather, the director and story writers think millennials lives suck and are trapped in the monotony of the aspirations previous generations' American Dream. And there is something strange about cuckoo birds too (pay attention). We would enjoy reading your comments about your thoughts after you've watched.Trip: Ahem! If I may interject for a quick couple notes? While watching Vivarium, I definitely thought of this film as the existential nightmare for millennials. My biggest problem with the movie is that it is so obvious in what it is doing that I felt like screaming \"just get to the point\" throughout its 90 minutes. Consequently, I found the film kind of repetitive and so \"boring\" is an apt description for something that otherwise has a potentially interesting premise. I will allow that there are some complicated themes to unpack after it's all done. Also, I think Imogen Poots was fine. She did what she was called to do and is the audience surrogate here, especially when the film examines parenthood in this day and age. Jesse Eisenberg, on the other hand, now makes me feel icky, and I think that's because he's very much associated with that smarmy, creep he's played in the past, Mark Zuckerberg. He's not doing that here, but the presence is still off-putting.Long story short, Vivarium is a strangely boring and ironically chuckle-worthy film. The cast is small and only delivers a couple notable moments. The film is worth a handful of popcorn for our creepy friend Martin and the post film symbolism analysis. If you get bored and have Amazon Prime, check out Vivarium to go house hunting for your forever home.Trip: Yep, it's a decent conversation piece. Check it out and send your comments about what it all means!"

There is supposed to be some \"profound\" hidden meaning about how buying a home , and having children, and being stuck in the suburban life is all a trap that makes you unhappy. Here is the problem, its not true. ANYTHING in life is a trap if you allow it to be. Buying a home isnt a trap, having and raising a child isnt a trap, they are choices. If you trap someone in an apartment with no contact with the world, no choices, and nothing but walls to look at with no choices, then they would be trapped and probably unhappy.  People buy houses in the suburbs because they want to and chose to, if they dont like it they choose to move. People choose to have and raise children because they choose to and accept the good with the bad. People become unhappy and feel helpless when they dont have choices. If you take away my tv, computer, phone, car, communication with all people and outside world,  take away my kids, and replace it all with a heartless annoying alien child, then paint my house ugly *$$ green color and tell me i cant leave, im gonna be one unhappy sob.  Another point in the plot that will drive you crazy is that anyone in that position either  wouldnt raise the alien child that is completely heartless with no emotion, or even if you chose to raise it, you would discipline the alien child. Then there is the lack of communication between Gemma and Tom. So there is  Tom,Gemma, an annoying  emotionless alien, stuck in an ugly house with nothing but walls to look at basically, and Tom and Gemma dont talk hardly at all. Save your time , if you want to watch people trapped , go watch a North Korean documentary, it would be more entertaining and you will get more out of it."

      "text": "A horribly bland \"thriller\" with no spice. I fully understand the premise and meaning of the movie but that doesn't excuse how horrible it is. They really could've just made a twenty-five minute short film with just the beginning part, a montage, then the ending, and it would be loads more enjoyable than this. The movie is painfully dragged out with the characters doing nothing but moping around and feeling bad for themselves. Yes, I get that they're in a helpless situation but that doesn't change how boring the movie is. It's like the director wanted to make a \"smart\" movie with scares that don't feel cheap but instead got an uneventful mess. Another gripe I have is how little questions are answered. I understand that with mystery comes fear and that a good movie leaves the viewer with questions afterward, but this isn't a good movie.[[SPOILER WARNING FOR THIS PARAGRAPH]]Why did the aliens set up  the trap this way? What gave them this idea? Why do they want to overthrow humans if obviously they're smart enough to live on their own. What did the boy learn from watching the TV? Why was the randomly mean at parts like locking Gemma and Tom out of their house? Why do the aliens think this is the best way to learn how to be human? Why did Gemma just give up? You could argue that she was too broken from the situation but if she had the strength to try and kill the boy then I don't understand why she didn't explore the weird underground area? Why did she sink through the floor in the underground area? Why did the boy let her see the book? Why didn't she ever try transcribing the book? Why didn't Tom or Gemma try and use the radio in the car to contact help? Why didn't they ever try breaking into other houses? Why didn't they ever try ripping up the concrete? Why did that giant hole not lead to anything but there was an entrance not very far under the road? What's with the funky colors when she was going through houses? Why did the lighter never run out of fuel? How did they rebuild the house so quickly when it got burned down?[[Spoilers are done :-)]]All of these questions are asked but none of them are answered, leaving the viewer frustrated after the movie. They had such an amazing idea and there were a lot of promising elements, but it was executed horribly. Please, don't watch this movie. It isn't worth it."

      "text": "I'll say the acting was good, but that alone can't save this movie. The CG animation quality is about on par with what you'd expect from the late 90's, the thinly veiled social critique seems misguided and the story is a hot mess. It's bits and pieces of acting strung together with no real intent of creating anything coherent. None of the mysteries get elaborated on in any meaningful way, half the scenes are practically irrelevant, because there is literally no payoff for anything. Utter waste of time, I was expecting something akin to The Trueman Show and ended up with garbage."

It's an interesting story to start with, and keeps you engaged waiting for some sort of explanation behind it all.But that never happens. If you just want to be entertained, skip this movie. If you want something that's a little bit more of a pshyco-horror art/think piece, then maybe you'll like this."
