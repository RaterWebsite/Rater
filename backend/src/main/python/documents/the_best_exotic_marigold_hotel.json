The cast, including some of England's finest (Maggie Smith, Judi Dench, Billy Nighy and Tom Wilkinson), is uniformly winning and the stories are sweet, if not predictable. Younger viewers may not appreciate its mature values, but the target audience is sure to find it charming, amusing and ultimately uplifting."

Plot development is also illogical, for example Maggie Smith's grouchy and tiresome character becoming all accommodating at the end. Also, the son's arranged marriage is all of a sudden conveniently thrown out of the window without so much as a pout. As if! The Indian locations, however, are gorgeous."

Dench is great, and all the great actors in the cast are unsurprising, hewing to a script without too much risk that tries to mix in pathos with the humor.

The get the brochure from the aforenamed hotel in Jaipur, which advertises that it is \"for elderly and beautiful people.\" When the guests arrive, they discover that they are the hotel's first guests and they go through all the hassles of dealing with any new business. Their story is a bit of a \"fish out of water\" story as they adjust to their environment, but it also depicts the character growth of not only the Brits but also of the hotel owner/manager and his family and friends. It finds both characteristics to celebrate and characteristics to make fun of in both cultures. And it has the requisite happy ending for most members of both groups, because \"everything will come out all right in the end. If it is not all right, then this must not be the end.\""

It basically brings several characters together, each with their own story that we get to see come to a close. It manages to bring some touching moments together but in the end I couldn't help but feel some of what this movie has to offer was wasted on me because I was too young to understand it. Still I do admire this movie. Some of the plot lines end in a predictable manner but still managed to keep me watching. I can't really say a bad thing about this movie, it may be aimed at an older audience but the movie is still charming."

Aside from that, this was a joy to watch. Almost every shot was planned in a way that delivered extra beauty or emotional punch. There was no sense that India was used only for background, the location was in every shot with gorgeous light, grunge and authenticity. And I am glad to be alive in a time where such elderly talent can employed as the focus of the story rather than a comic or tragic sidetrip. Revelatory, really. Humorous, touching, and intimate. My only gripe is that there were too many storylines, and I could've easily done without the romance by the younger Indian couple (the fact that their dialog was delivered in English didn't help). But to carp about this misses the point, that this was made in an EPIC manner.... the art direction and photography were STUNNING and there is plenty to enjoy in the story and quality acting. Like many movies, I only think it would've been stronger if it was 15 minutes shorter."

      "text": "The film works very well overall.  It's greatest strength is, of course, the amazing cast.  The standouts are Maggie Smith as a hilariously racist old woman stuck in a country full of \"others,\" Judi Dench as a still grieving widow looking for change, Bill Nighy as an unhappily married man, and Tom Wilkinson who's spent his whole life thinking of the man he once loved, who he left behind in India.  These four are just wonderful to watch and they provide a lot of good humor.  But then their is Dev Patel, who is less spectacular.  The story follows these elderly people in India, and then randomly brings in Patel's character as another side plot, even though it breaks from the continuity of these elderly people looking for meaning in their life now that they are old and retired.  I also found issue with the fact that the characters often spoke of the color and beauty of India, yet they didn't show much of it, other than many crowded streets.  Lastly, the end of the movie was a mad dash to try and resolve all of the loose ends in under 15 minutes and it ended up failing.  Even with these problems, the cast alone is more than capable of carrying this movie smoothly from beginning to end."

The story fell flat though, and the unneeded intrusion of controversial topics wasn't needed. It seemed like an artificial attempt at adding depth to an otherwise run of the mill story.\r Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed the movie, but it left me with yet another reassurance that Hollywood is out of touch with the values of the majority of Americans. What's worse is that many of the more risque or controversial topics seemed tossed in solely to convince us this was indeed a \"deep drama.\" However, at further inspection you can see this movie is about a few elderly people who are delusional to think that living out sexual fantasies will make them feel young and worthwhile. You'd think after living an entire life they'd have realized there is more to life than that.\r Enjoyable movie, but not one I'd see again or even recommend. Go see something else. Save yourself some money."

      "text": "A pleasant if conventional crowd-pleaser that makes great use of its seven experienced lead actors, 'The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel' is an enjoyable moviegoing treat with heartwarming performances and some great imagery of India to please our eyes. At times, the film suffers from extreme pacing problems and overall predictability (you won't find any surprises as far as plot is concerned). Along with being a bit too melodramatic, the characters' problems feel somewhat slight and the general tone of the movie is one of low stakes and leisure fun. All that being said, the performance aspect is grade-A and every actor receives a fitting vignette worthy of their talents. Tom Wilkinson's character, an aged gay man returning to India to find his long lost love, has the best side story by far and there is an air of seriousness and dramatic pull in the scenes depicting his search that is sorely lacking throughout the rest of the film. It's great to watch all of these inspired performances birthed from less-than-inspired characters (Judi Dench playing against type as a vulnerable widow and Maggie Smith as a hardened wheelchair-bound racist are some other highlighted spots), but sometimes we could use a little more heft to the story. Still, this is a very warm movie in general and is so far one of my favorites from 2012."

      "text": "The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is not exactly an artistic achievement, so it is tough to assess it as a piece of art. Instead, it is classic feel good cinema that is easy to digest and settles easily in the stomach, rather than making a big fuss about the whole thing. Unlike the Indian food on display in the film, this is not a film that will cause diarrhea, except for those who may struggle to digest sweets. A funny and deeply endearing flick about a bunch of British people coming to teach Indians how to live life the British way, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel may be a bit too much for some, but is largely pleasant cinema. It is funny with a great cast that hardly ever puts a foot wrong acting-wise. Though a bit quaint, the film's endearing charm is really hard to overcome.The film, to some, could be described as racist. Yet, it often feels like a film that is conflicted in this arena. On one hand, you have Evelyn (Judi Dench) teach professional call center workers how to talk on the phone to British people, as if they have no idea. Evelyn has no experience calling, yet talks down to them as an authority. Sonny (Dev Patel) is a charming kid who is just a scattered foreigner who has no idea what to do with running a hotel because he is a dumb foreigner (right?). Toss in repeated jokes about how bad India smells (it probably does for those who are new though, not being racist, but Indian food is a rather strong smelling food so until you adjust to being in areas where the food may be, it definitely will hit your nose hard) and jokes about Indian marriage customs and it is not hard to see why some would take offense. It is rather low-brow with this humor and these depictions, even if Muriel (Maggie Smith) oddly changes all of this for the better to a degree. Initially quite racist with broad and sweeping stereotyping attacks against Indians, Muriel grows over the course of the film to respect Indians and other races for how they help her in spite of her rude behavior. Even then, she winds up being a white savior for poor Sonny and his crappy hotel. Thus, I would have to lean towards this one being quite a bit offensive and racist, even if it does not actively intend to be this way.Fortunately, it is incredibly funny. Bill Nighy, Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, and Dev Patel, are all an absolute pleasure to watch. Nighy, obviously, steals the show as he always does, though Patel's frantic and nervous turn gives him a run for his money. As an entire cast, this charming collection of British screen actors and the one Indian actor that Hollywood will allow (quotas and all) really make this film zip by with light enjoyment. The smart comedic script plays perfectly into the wheelhouse of its actors, allowing them to all deliver their lines with zip and comedic timing to make the lines really pop. The film may be a bit too quaint and giddy in depicting old age, but it is hard to deny that the film is funny. The comedy does not always work, but it is a film that can keep you laughing throughout and that is rather hard to come by nowadays.Set in gorgeously designed locales, one of the major appeals of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is certainly its visuals. Throughout much of the film, the film is shot rather plainly, hardly ever capturing the eye. However, whenever director John Madden's camera slips out of his firm grip and captures some terrain or India at sunset by the water, it is hard not be gripped by the beauty. While the film does not really explore the terrain too much, the pieces of the set it showcases - especially the hotel - are very nicely designed and fun places to explore. Toss in some nice depictions of the hustle and bustle of India, as well as the natural beauty of the country, and you have a film that is rather pleasant to look at, even if it is rather unadventurously shot.Funny, engaging, and largely quite pleasant, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is simply easy breezy entertainment. It is easy to find fault in its picture perfect facade, but why nitpick a film that I found so pleasant and fun to watch? Honestly, however, watching Bill Nighy do anything in a film is going to garner at least a lukewarm positive response from me and this film is hardly an exception to that rule. Though not the most artistic film ever made, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is the type of cheesy and idealistic Hollywood film that just feels good to watch. It is like the ratty pair of sweatpants your mom begs you not to wear in public, but I want to wear them BECAUSE THEY ARE COMFORTABLE DAMMIT."

However, around 65minutes into the film I had to turn the film off due to distractions (visitors) I then left it for a few days before finishing watching it. I wouldn't usually go back to a film after only half watching it but there was something different about this film that made me want to see how it finished. The film gave a insight into each characters life at the beginning  which made you feel closer to the characters throughout. As I am British I found it great how I could recognise the actors/actresses. I believe  Judi Dench really made this film what it is, great acting and she really shows good emotion in her speaking.
