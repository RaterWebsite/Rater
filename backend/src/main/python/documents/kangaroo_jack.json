And the artificial computerized Kangaroo Jack is shockingly painful to look at when at a movie theater.

Otherwise, this would be a one from me."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "I'm shocked that a 4 out of 10 is \"mixed,\" because \"Kangaroo Jack\" is bad. Just your typical poorly written, unfunny, poorly-acted live-action CGI hybrid film that might not even be good enough for kids, considering the jokes told in the movie. If you're having a \"Bad Movie Night,\" \"Kangaroo Jack\" could be a little bit of fun (it's not a complete abomination to cinema), but otherwise, you're better exploring other options, regardless of whether or not you're a kid or an adult."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "This movie is so un-Australian that it would make Crocodile Dundee and Steve Irwin renounce their citizenship and move to Fiji to evade any ridicule caused by that \"movie\".\r Quick Ozzie joke aside, that movie is unbelievably stupid, pointless, and lacking ANY kind of sense. Want proof? The titular characters barely as ANY screen time. Instead, we follow the idiotic adventures of Dumb and Dumber wannabes Chris \"ugly playboy\" O'Donnell and Anthony \"i'm just going to be the black sidekick for the rest of my uninspiring career\" Anderson who team up with Estella \"bombshell that has swapped her personality and talent for a big rack\" Warren to get some money from some guy... I don't know... honestly, this movie is not worth mentioning. Well, maybe aside of the fact that it shows off Australia as a land where people cannot communicate in English and are still bearing the personality traits of the couple criminals that were shipped down under.\r Oh, and Michael Shannon has clearly had time to prepare for his screen chewing performance as Zod. Oh yeah, he will find the inspiration."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "\"Jesus. That was really scary. When Kangaroo rapped in 'Kangaroo Jack', that animated sequence, I found that disconcerting.
