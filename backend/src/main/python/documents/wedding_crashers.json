After watching it again and again its pretty clear that Wedding Crashers is still to date one of the best and most memorable comedies of recent times. It follows John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn)  a set of divorce mediators who are also \"Wedding Crashers.\" They go from wedding to wedding, girl to girl and live the lifestyle that men dream off but at the \"Kentucky Derby\" of weddings - The U.S Secretary of Treasure William Cleary's (Christopher Walken) daughter that all changes when John falls for his other daughter Claire (Rachel McAdams). What unfolds is an unforgettable and hysterical series of events and some of the most memorable one-liners and quotes as John sets about wooing Claire from under the arms of Sack (portrayed superbly by Bradley Cooper), Jeremy has to deal with his \"stage 5 virgin clinger\" Gloria.

Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn really complimenting each other performance to the max. They are perfect. The whole Cleary's family are funny and so full of character. As a bonus, they add a very special scene with Will Ferrell. That scene was hilarious and legendary. You can't have it this way anymore in 2017. If Hollywood decides to make another one of this today,  I can imagine Twitter will be in full rage, burning buildings, rants, and riots in all 69 states.If you haven't seen it already, I absolutely recommend Wedding Crashers to anyone who wants to laugh and keep laughing (with an open mind ofc)."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Holy God, what a piece of Hollywood Crap! What's so baffling is the number of critics who actually pretended to like this smarmy, we're-funny-celebrities-acting-silly, unoriginal dogfart. Don't waste your time.

It's disturbing how this turd is raking in the millions. In an attempt to exploit it's R rating, the film often crosses the line of funny and enters into the territory of the tasteless.

Rachel McAdams is stunning, her smile alone deserves a better film."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "I had heard from a couple of respected sources that this was a \"hill-LARRY-us\" movie, so I went into it expecting some laughs. I have an appreciation for the occasional \"dumb\" movies and \"adult\" humor, but this movie was chockablock with giant plot holes, obvious stereotypes (yawn!), and was waaay too long (double yawn!) getting to the obvious conclusion. I think I was creeped out by guys their age with reasonable careers doing such incredibly dumb things that they should've gotten out of their systems 15+ years prior! I've seen the two leads do much better in other movies (but paired with other people).

This movie is a well smart out comedy, with some better writing than we've seen in the past. Movies like this can be a dime a dozen, or come out as a bad sitcom cliche.

Until one of them meets the girl of their dreams that is. What follows is a pretty funny disastrous stay with some truly crazy people. While one guy tries to woe the girl, the other gets punished for his lothario ways. They both end up taking their lumps in the end though. Regularly funny and benefiting from the comedic chemistry between Wilson and Vaughn, the only real problem with this movie is it's over-reliance on formula for the plot. You can predict how the whole thing is going to play out. Guy makes girl question her current relationship, guy's lies get found out, he gets depressed, and everything works out in the end. While you know the route it's going to take, it doesn't make things any less funny. The sharp dialog and crazy, ridiculous scenarios still make for a solid comedy."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Sur le papier, Serial Noceurs avait tout de la com\u00c3\u00a9die am\u00c3\u00a9ricaine qui flirte avec les gags lourds, pr\u00c3\u00a9sentant en sc\u00c3\u00a9nario une situation tout aussi burlesque (ici, un duo qui a pour hobbie de s'inviter \u00c3\u00a0 des mariages pour une aventure d'un soir) sans pour autant \u00c3\u00aatre m\u00c3\u00a9morable.

But these genuine moments are comprised of smaller moments that happen in the broader scheme, there are a lot of things going on to the point where many characters get left behind, but I\u2019ll get to that. We meet Jeremy and John, played by the excellent comedy duo of Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, a pair of wedding crashers, there is no catch here, this is what they actually do, besides being lawyers, they crash an obscene amount of weddings as a way to bed various lucky ladies who are present at the wedding, then they move on, some of these scenes are terrific as they fake their way into the ceremony and then deliver the goods in the reception. The real punch comes in the form of Treasury Secretary Clearly, who is played by none other than Christopher Walken, this guy can make anything sound funny, yet he is grossly underused in this comedy, is that even possible? But even so, Jeremy and John are after the daughters of the man, seeing this as the jackpot, they get in quite deep, Jeremy (Vaughn) seduces the crazy and unstable Gloria (Isla Fisher) while John falls for the irresistible Claire (Rachel McAdams). But Claire has a fiancee, the not very nice Sack (Bradley Cooper), who is just quite uncomfortable to watch in each scene he is in, Cooper is a phenomenal actor, but his role in this film is jarring and distracting. The bum note of the film is the opportunities it misses, dragging out scenes for longer than they should and not giving enough for Walken to do, but the film has excellent moments with Vaughn and Wilson on top form, they often stray off in perfect comic timing which unfortunately loses steam as the film ticks on, there is a lot of talent that is underused, such as Henry Gibson playing a priest who doesn\u2019t really have much to do apart from making various faces to show shock or other emotions at stories he is told, or the forgotten son, Todd (Keir O\u2019Donnell), who has many funny moments and setups, but ultimately these don\u2019t amount to much. One of the highlights actually comes from a small role for Will Ferrell, playing the master of the wedding crashing game, his moments on screen are comedy gold but just don\u2019t last long enough. In the midst, this is still a funny film, it has plenty of gags that work in relation to the film and has its fair share of top notch scenes, particularly more candid ones amongst the talent rather than she they are all in the same room at the same time.\rThe idea and some of the delivery is there, this has an all star cast but simply loses track too many times which leaves its consistency in the gutter, but some decent performances and also some side splitting moments make this enjoyable enough, but a bit too long for its misplacement."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Wedding Crashers at first promises to be a crude guy comedy, but somewhere down the line morphs into an overly predictable chick flick.
