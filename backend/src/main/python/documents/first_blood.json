Stallone's greatest acting performance. An instant classic imho - has brilliant character development and an excellent story with some amazing gun shooting action. Awesome cast - everyone is perfectly casted and each portray the characters brilliantly. No doubt, First Blood is the best in the Rambo series."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "First Blood is not the Rambo movie you would expect to see. The moral ambiguity of the film makes it much smarter and more subtle than its sequels. And the fantastic performance of Sylvester Stallone sells the whole picture."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "It was ok. It was interesting at first but then it just turned into a full fledged action film that was rather pointless and unrealistic (plot wise). Overall it was decent."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "First Blood. He thought the war was over for him. A great start to the new Sylvester Stallone franchise. You worry about his Rambo and you understand why he does certain things. In general, a good action movie."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "This is quite a good action film. I certainly felt on the side of the main character and it'd be hard not to be annoyed at the local sheriff, William Teasel. It was interesting how he reacted to the colonel who stepped in to try and save him from Rambo. The dynamics of the characters are good I suppose but of course this is, first and foremost/primarily, an action film. There are certainly some good explosions and chase scenes. I thought this was quite a good film I'd recommend."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Great movie.It holds so well year after year!The sequels were awful, but the first one meant a milestone."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "this is the best action thriller movie of all times, the best performance of Sylvester Stallone in my opinion the best of the trilogy.

I own them all and i like them all, but Rambo 2-4 are just \"Lets Rambo kill hundreds of bad guys\" without a real story. Rambo - first blood, shows a vietnam vet mocked without a reason by some Polivemen. Because of his experience during his prison in vietnam he starts raging and runs away from the cops and hides in the woods. The Cops start to act violently against him, until he starts to return the favour. In this movie Rambo avoids violence for a long time. Its not a blood and gorefest like the other parts. Thumbs up for one of the best true action movies. Good storytelling and good entertainement, without CG Explosions and stuff, needed in todays movies."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "El ejemplo de lo que hacen los americanos cuando los critican, lo trasforman en un producto hollywoodense como en Rambo 2 y 3, aunque esto no quiere decir que sean malas pel\u00edculas, pero esta es mejor porque a pesar de que el personaje es un experto en combate, tambi\u00e9n se lo muestra muy vulnerable y lo mismo sucede con la sociedad americana que a pesar de ser organizada y prospera, le dio la espalda a estos veteranos de guerra solo porque no la ganaron. Una de las mejores actuaciones de Stallone sobre todo en la escena final."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "A great start to a great series, with astounding performances and a nice story."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Really enjoyed this movie, kinda underrated but is really awesome action movie, Stallone did great on it."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "!!!amazing movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "It's one of the few perfect movies I've seen in my lifetime"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Classic movie not only with some nice and intelligent action, but also with a good story, nice duell between Rambo and the police chief and a sad ending.

Who cares if we get fat?!\"From the stage, to the silver screen - Brian Dennehy is the type of talent that comes once in a life time.He played a hand full of roles.
