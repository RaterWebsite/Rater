Anyone who's ever done what he's doing in the movie, like martial arts, guns etc can truly appreciate the realness of everything. Since when have you seen nunchuks used like this in a movie? The action never gets boring and always keeps you on your toes. Usually movie quality drops as more are made, it's rare sequels are ever as good as the first but not with John Wick. Each movie just keeps getting better, they never lost sight what made the movie so great and why people keep coming back for more.Let's hope the story continues."

      "text": "John Wick Chapter 4 is a love letter to action film-making and every action cinema lovers wet dream. The cinematography is oscar worthy, the neo-noir genre has never looked better on the big screen as the bold and vibrant colours makes each scene of this film a bold underlined statement that what you are experiencing is something special.The action choreography utilizies 100% of each and every set design used in the film to incorporate drama, thrill and also comedy. This movie has everything you could ever ask for - guns, knifes, nunchucks, katanas, martial arts, cars, flamethrowers, bare hands etc. The stuntwork is jaw-dropping and adrenaline inducing, specially a stunt that was performed on a staircase on the later half of the film, left me wondering how did the stunt coordinator get that Tom Cruise-level life threatening stunt greenlit.But what truly makes this story special are the characters and the drama surrounding them as they manoeuvre their way through this twisted world of crime where each person is their only friend. There are a lot of new characters introduced and none of them feel throwaway as each and everyone of them bring something new and exciting to the table and moves the narrative forward. And the centre of this narrative, Keanu Reeves who plays John Wick, a loving husband proves once again why his contribution to this role will be remembered forever as something that revolutionalized action film-making.This was the one of the most satisfying experience I ever had inside a movie theatre and it leaves you with the question that how many times are you going to return to experience this once in a lifetime masterclass in action film-making.10/10 - John wick Chapter 4 is a a modern day classic"

John Wick 4 provides a cinema experience which boasts one of the most captivating and engaging stories that I have ever witnessed. Utterly and fully a time at the movies you will never forget. The already dazzling storyline is this time mixed with a suite of impeccably shot and staggeringly choreographed fight sequences. On the level of anything you've seen from this franchise and more. The scope is broadened to represent the full scale of what action films have to offer. Lengthy battle scenes somehow don't drag out a 3 hour long film, but only serve as to enhance this marvel of a gem of a picture that unreasonably locks you up in chains and takes you for a ride you can't escape. But even if you could, you wouldn't want to. This is a film you absolutely MUST see on the biggest screen possible."

      "text": "Ever since John Wick came out in theaters in 2014, unknown to general audiences, as a niche action-thriller film with R-rated action, its success has catapulted the character and its franchise into stardom. Many critics now hail it as \"a work of pop cinema so blissfully, albeit brutally, entertaining that you come out of it feeling even more resentful of its multiplex neighbors for not making a similar effort.\" with some even comparing it to the Mad Max franchise, another critically-acclaimed action franchise. As always, due to the high bar set by its predecessors, it is always certain that one may harbor doubts if another sequel(a fourth one!) would be able to live up to the anticipation. It is especially true in an era of sequels, remakes, or spin-offs that fall short of the mark, to devastating consequences to the franchise.I can say that JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 4, has not only lived but exceeded expectations(both personally and generally) in all aspects, especially its story. The continuation to John Wick 3, where John was found wounded and seeking revenge against his foes, the way how the story travels not only throughout the world but with also the characters, who are with complex personalities and motives that make you understand and even sympathize with the characters. Of course, there is the recurring cast of Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Ian McShane, and the late Lance Reddick(R.I.P). They once again seamlessly fit into their characters and continue to provide Oscar-worthy performances. This is a brief review(for now, the characters). I will be re-editing this with more about the cinematography, setting, and more details about the plot. Ps: This is for now not a spoilers review."

It was a visually stunning joy ride, as each scene unfolds like a carefully crafted work of art. The lighting and diverse locations perfectly complement the jaw-dropping action sequences, making John Wick Chapter 4 a true sensory marvel. While I had to suspend disbelief and buy in to the fact that this is despite what characters say, consequences are variable in the world of John Wick. This did add a certain delightful quality when normals rules didn\u2019t apply, it didn\u2019t feel out of place - given Wicks journey so far, little would by the time you sit down for chapter 4.Highlights for me include the confrontation scene in Osaka, everything involving Caine, Killa, and of course that staircase. Certainly sets a high bar for cinematography in the next award seasons, it is tremendously impressive work. For me this was the best action movie I\u2019ve ever seen, top class!  As action goes I have felt in recent times that this genre needed more substance, and this brought it in droves and body bags, action doesn\u2019t get much better than John Wick 4. Go see this!"

      "text": "John Wick is one of the best action franchises in modern cinema. When John Wick first came out in 2014, it was one of the most surprising yet most enjoyable experiences I had. What is even more amazing is that the 2 sequels it got were also amazing! We are now on the 4th entry and the question is if it continues to maintain the quality it has so far.Let's get the obvious out of the way, the action scenes are still absolutely amazing! One thing each entry in this franchise continues to do is to make the action bigger and crazier than the last. There are so many incredible actions set pieces with a roughly 30-minute action scene in Osaka with bows and swords, a stunning sequence in Paris with cars and traffic, a Hotel Miami style action sequence with overhead shots, and one of the best action sequences ever involving stairs. I give every single praise to the stunt people who worked on this as they take some very painful falls in this film. This entry is also the best-looking one in the franchise. The set design and cinematography are phenomenal. John Wick killing people has never looked as beautiful as it does here.Keanu continues to be awesome as John Wick by still doing the action choreography at the age of 57. We get to see him fight with nunchucks and shoot goons while driving a car. Ian McShane, Lance Reddick (R.I.P) and Laurence Fishburne return as Winston, Charon and the Bowery King respectively. They're all still great but have a smaller role this time. There are many new supporting characters are great as well. Donnie Yen joins the franchise as Caine, a blind assassin, who is an old friend but now foe. Donnie Yen always gives his A-game and here is no exception with how he does action as a blind character makes him interesting to watch. Hiroyuki Sanada is Koji who is the manager of the Osaka Continental Hotel who is just a badass and cool guy, Rina Sawayama makes her acting debut as Akira and she does a good job in her small role with some good action as well. Shamier Anderson plays an assassin who tracks John Wick and he also does some great action. What they do with his character is interesting but the best thing is that he has a dog which makes him 100% better. Scott Adkins plays Kilia and he does a good job as a minor antagonist. The main antagonist, Marquis Vincent, is played by Bill Skarsgard and he does a great job of being hateable.What Chapter 4 has over Chapters 2 and 3 is more emotional elements to the story. John Wick is deservingly angry after 3 but you also get to see him contemplate more about when this bloodshed will end. You see him question a lot of what he is doing and whether these conflicts that are bringing his friends into are worth it. Additionally, his relationship with Caine (Donnie Yen) adds some weight to the conflict by making close friends fight each other. The stakes in this film feel bigger as well. Some people complain about the 2-hour 45-minute runtime but the pacing never felt bad and the quieter moments are enjoyable too. If I had to give a negative then the only one, I can think of is the post-credit scene which dampens the ending a little bit.Overall, what an outstanding film! It's insane to think that even on its 4th entry, this film continues to be entertaining and somehow still amazing! Director Chad Stahelski has made an extraordinary franchise and shows everyone in Hollywood, how to make an action movie. With the inclusion of a post-credit scene, I wonder if the plan is to make a new cinematic universe which worries me a bit. There are a lot of potential spinoff ideas such as a Caine (Donnie Yen) spinoff or a Tracker spinoff (Shamier Anderson) or a spinoff with the John Wick 3 character Sofia (Halle Berry). Whatever they do, if it is the same quality as the John Wick movies, then I will be first in line to watch."

He can do action scenes and that's the main thing for me and I was entertained the whole movie. Add to the fighting and shooting a hilarious soundtrack and the fun was taken care of. I've heard a bit of criticism about the length, but I was fine with it. I wasn't bored for a moment. I also praise the surprise ending. I thought the fourth episode was very good. But after some thought, I'm still leaning towards the third one, which charmed me with its action a bit more than here. The locations were also great and I liked them a lot, but I will mention the third part again, which appealed to me more with its setting. I don't have much to add. John Wick is a luxury action series for me and probably always will be. The action is the main thing here for me and it succeeded this time and once again I praise the surprise ending. For me, a great film that I recommend to fans of the series or action genre enthusiasts."

The high stakes and increased death count make the character's journey even more intense, and Reeves rises to the challenge with ease.The action sequences in John Wick: Chapter 4 are nothing short of spectacular. Each set piece is magnificently choreographed and shot, with a clear homage to classic martial-arts genres and Hollywood Westerns. The movie also manages to top everything that's come before in the franchise, with new and creative ways to keep the audience engaged.It's also worth mentioning that the film is an absolute joy to watch in IMAX, with the immersive experience making the action sequences all the more thrilling.While the weight of trying to top everything that's come before is not lost on the filmmakers, they rise to the challenge with elegance and creativity, delivering a movie that is both a homage to the classic action genre and a fresh addition to the franchise.In short, John Wick: Chapter 4 is a killer night out at the movies. With an incredible performance from Keanu Reeves, stunning visuals, and non-stop action, it's a must-watch for fans of the series and anyone looking for an immersive and thrilling cinematic experience."
