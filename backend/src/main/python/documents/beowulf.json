Beowulf is BY FAR the most disgracing piece of computer images put together. If you have read the book the film is absurd. If you haven't it's demented. Thank Odin the book is miles and LEAGUES away from the piece of junk the collaborators of this retardation came up with. If Beowulf was anything like what was presented in the film, then the \"Lord of the Rings\" would have been called \"The Grey King's Biography\" and it would have been written by someone else. In short; if any Geatish hero still exists, I call upon thee, to slay the producers and director of this atrocity. These are the only monsters that endager your kingdom."

The first half is dull and second half has a bit more gore and kiddish story of the book and epics is not well used but some fun provides. In voice acting or CGI acting its cool but nothing special. The ending is clueless and characters have no depth or story. The 3-D is good, yeah but could have been used well. The gore and violence is endless and the UNRATED version is worse. Zemeckis makes the real  he digs in deep and makes it up to serve the nudity, sex, gore and violence of this dull war epic."

I thought it brought a difficult text to life, giving it a new interpretation suited for cinematic length and modern audiences, and would be brilliant for A level literature students.  When this poem was first written down it had already been narrated by travelling storytellers for centuries, changing and improvising it into many versions, so those who complain it isn't a strict interpretation should see it in its historical context.  I thought the animation was brilliant; dark , chilling, horrific, gory and allowing fight sequences worthy of its heroes.  The cast, even behind their animated avatars, were brave and noble.  And I thought the story of Grendel's mother was a great plot idea giving an extra, modern twist to the tragedy.  All in all, one of the best movies I have seen for ages."

      "text": "Hugely underestimated gem. On the surface, it's just another hero movie, with a rambunctious and invincible Beowulf. It goes much deeper than that though, with a persistent feeling of an Age that is coming to an end.Beowulf is a liar, exaggerating his own adventures, and learns all too soon that your dreams tend to decay around you once you make them come true. He fails his most important trial and will eventually have to pay a hefty price for that.Rothgar is an aging, disgusting pig living on past glories, surrounded by adulators who only crave his gold. His famed mead hall is just a glorified shack.When Beowulf comes as the hero who will defeat the monster, there is no oceanic crowd cheering him but just a few, unconvinced peasants. And in the background the Christian religion is undermining what remains of the days of the glorious heroes, fighting in the name of the Norse Gods.It's a crepuscular tale of regret and longing, for an ideal that cannot really exist. In many ways, it can be regarded of a coming of age tale, of romanticism that eventually needs to confront reality."

Anyone wanting to go see good cg should buy final fantasy advent children.Im familiar with the beowulf legend and this movie represented it fairly but that doesnt make for a good movie..The cg was very poor the overall look was completely sparse and it was so boring through the whole thing I was tempted to walk out as many others did.The movie was generally pretty quiet.. there wasnt much of a score nor was there any effective bgs which made it that much easier to tune out..My friend agreed and it left us both unsatisfied and ripped off in the end...Save your money and wait 3 months for the dvd..The 1 by the way is just for ANgelina Jolie she was gorgeous in it."

This is the type of Movie I expected to see when I walked into 300, but didn't get from 300. Its Beautiful to look at, full of action, and \"overall\" the dialogue is engaging. I found it a relief to have actually enjoyed an action movie for once this year as all I have gotten was 2 hours of dull drool and 20 minutes of campy action that took itself too serious. And for god sakes as far as an enjoyable theater experience, see this thing in 3D, you cant beat it."

      "text": "Here is a thought! Abolish the MPAA rating system. Since apparently the one in place absolutely cannot be trusted. I quote from the MPAA PG-13 guidelines, \"More than brief nudity will require at least a PG-13 rating, but such nudity in a PG-13 rated motion picture generally will not be sexually oriented.\" Wow, I guess I was imaging things because I could have sworn while watching Beowulf that not only is the nudity in this picture prolonged, but it extremely sexuality oriented, having unrelenting sexual references throughout the moving as well. Oh, and don't forget the obvious sexual moaning during a scene with nearly fully exposed heaving breasts either. The sexual wording is such that it carefully and conveniently circumvents direct reference to sex using antiquated wording like \"fornication\" and \"having knowledge,\" while sexual acts, some of which are highly incestuous, are explicitly implied. Furthermore, the violence in this movie is over the top. \"There may be depictions of violence in a PG-13 movie, but generally not both realistic and extreme or persistent violence.\" The violence in this movie is highly realistic, extreme, and persistent. Due to the 3-D effects, this movie is quite intense. This movie obviously belongs in a category higher than PG-13- the MPAA system guidelines state so plain as day. Who needs an MPAA system anyway. The movie industry clearly does not care about rating a movie properly, only about appealing to as many demographic areas as possible at the same time in order to make as much money as possible."

Beowulf himself had the voice of Ray Winstone, but the look of Sean Bean. Worst of all seemed to be the inconsistency of dialects; whoever heard of a cockney South African?

I really enjoyed this retelling of a classic. I like the contrast that shows the difference between the deeds of heroes and their lives. . It shows the human falicy that can exist in even the most legendary of men. Also the 3-D was spectacular. Axes, swords, blood, guts, and fire right in your face! Top notch stuff!. I am defiantly going to see this again. If you want gay swans..stick to the art house. If you want satisfying action with some sword swinging gusto..check out BEOWULF!"

I've seen 3-D movies before and having objects come out of the screen and poke at the audience is one of the main draws of 3-D. There's plenty of that in this movie but also something else I don't recall seeing --- that is having objects appear to come from behind the audience and move toward the screen. The story was good and interesting and the battle scenes, especially the last scene with the dragon, were exciting and imaginative. A great movie which will stay in my memory for a long, long time."

      "text": "There are few things in this film that may remind you of the 8th century epic poem which it is supposedly based on. Pros: Some battle instances and scenary layout. Cons: -No deep understanding at all of Germanic conscience. -Angelina Jolie's character is a platitude in itself thanks to \"modern\" additions (female fluidity, females and temptation...etc). -In the poem, beowulf cuts the heads of Grendel and his mother. In the \"modern\" version, Mr. Zemeckis seems more interested in hinting at a sexual curse (with profuse tasteless puns and one-liners throughout the film) than in rendering the epic poem as it was originally compiled. -Complete misunderstanding of the conflict between Germanic and Christian thought in the original poem. -I bet Mr. Zemeckis has never read J. R. R. Tolkien's article \"The Monsters and the Critics\" in order to get to know what the monster deal in this epic poem is about. The film actually blasts away the sense of doom in these Germanic tribes' conscience and pays no attention to the description that the original 8th-century poem makes of Grendel and his mother. The important thing to Mr. Zemeckis seems just to display Miss Jolie and to bring up a circa 1975 depiction of grendel as a victim of society. It is a \"passtime\" film easily entertaining to people who have not read the original poem, who had no idea about its plot or cultural context and who may not express their disgust at Mr. Zemeckis' platitudinal and superficial portrayal of Germanic society. The director, the actors and the scriptwriter should have read the Anglo Saxon poem first (or Seamus Heaney's verse translation) and some articles on it, including Tolkien's \"The Monsters and the Critics\". This film is a \"fast-food passtime\", a lost opportunity that pays little homage to the original Anglo-Saxon work."

      "text": "If you're going to rate 'Beowulf' fairly, you need to grade it on two seperate scales. On one scale is the 3-D and animation, which are (and this a word I rarely if ever use to describe anything) perfect- pore to pore, pimple to pimple, these characters and their world comprise what is without a doubt the single most realistic animated film ever. It doesn't hurt that the 3-D is put to very good use, not so much a ploy as it is a plot thread in of itself, as it totally and completely submerges us into the story. But if this sounds like a rave review, don't be mistaken- if anything, Beowulf is more of a failure than a success. Why? Well, for one, these characters, as realistic and stunning to look at as they are, are only that- stunning to look at. They have no depth, soul, and heart, which makes it very difficult to even care about them, let alone what they're doing or what's even happening the movie itself. The actual plot itself is a bit of a letdown, too- I realize that it's based on an old poem, but from what I've heard, they do change it quite a bit, and it's a shame that the story eventually desolves into a simple case of back and forth, back and forth (I won't reveal anything, but suffice to say, should you see it, you'll immediately see what I'm talking about, and just as quickly get heavy eyed). All in all, it is an entertaining, visually astonishing film... but altogether, it's just not a very successful or meaningful one."

I would've like to hear more about the loss of myths thanks to the move from polytheism to monotheism. It's mentioned, but feels more like an afterthought.
