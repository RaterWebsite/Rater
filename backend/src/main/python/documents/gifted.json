Marc Webb is good but fails to utilize the utter potential of its brilliant script by Tom Flynn. Chris Evans still needs to ante up his game for in some sequences McKenna Grace and other supporting cast overpowers him. Gifted needed better execution and editing especially carrying off such high pitched dramatic sequences that is supposed to mesmerize the audience."

This is just another, but another great among them. There's actually nothing special about it. It's simple and emotional. The characters were slightly different, and agenda for courtroom drama is interesting aspect of the film.A single uncle who is a by-default guardian for his niece since her mother had died. But the seven year old kid is a math prodigy like her mother. He wanted her to live a normal life like everybody else in her age. That's what her mother wanted as well. When her grandmother learns about the gift, is now seeking a court intervene to provide all she needed to nurture her gift, since she's very rich. So the kid caught between adult's fight, how the rest of the narration folds are emotionally told.I'm not a fan of Captain America, because he's not the Captain Earth or Captain my country. Other than that, Chris Evans is not a big marketable star. But this was a pretty cool performance. The kid too was awesome. The last time I saw her was from 'Mr Church'. Well written and directed. Easily one of the best drama films of the year. A good message film as well. Families should watch it.8/10"

      "text": "On January 17th 2009, visionary and talented music video director Marc Webb made his feature length debut with the totally original and highly unusual romantic/comedy/drama 500 Days of Summer. The film, which went on to be a total critical success, box office spectacle and cult classic, made a name for Webb, who, with his original first film, landed the second leg of Spider-Man\u2019s totally unnecessary \u201cThe Amazing\u201d series reboot. Webb, who went on to direct two instalments of our friendliest neighbourhood superhero, re-casting Peter Parker with Andrew Garfield, [in our opinion] the best Peter Parker we have seen so far, was unable to tap into what made Summer so great, and really showed audiences how little creativity and imagination exists inside studio tentpole films. Sadly, while Webb\u2019s Spider-Man films went on to make a ton of money, it proved that just because your movies make money after such a beloved independent film, does not mean that audiences actually adore your body of work. Luckily for audiences, Webb has finally returned to the small scale end of filmmaking, with his newest film Gifted; an emotional and human story of extraordinary circumstances, set with ordinary people.Sadly, while big name studios continue to cultivate independent break-out directors for their high-profile tentpoles (Colin Treverrow and Jurassic World, Jordan Vogt-Roberts and Kong: Skull Island and Gareth Edwards and Godzilla) we are hoping that the day arrives that these absolutely amazing visionaries find a way to blend the creativeness that once made them recognized, with the profitable property they are in charged of brining to the big screen.This time around, instead of Spidey, director Marc Webb had the chance of directing the Avenger\u2019s Cap in this emotional and human story of selflessness and unconditional love. Gifted is by no means a large scale film, despite having Captain Avenger himself front and centre.Evans plays Frank Adler, an ivy-league educated man who, until recently, was given the responsibility of raising his brilliant but deceased sister\u2019s daughter Mary Adler (Mckenna Grace). Frank\u2019s sister Diane was a brilliant mind, who was on the cusp of solving the Navier-Stokes Existence and Smoothness Millennium problem; one of seven of the Millennium Prize Problems. Now, if you are any no way mathematically inclined and have no idea what a Millennium Problem is, here is your history lesson. A Millennium Problem consists of seven of the most complex and difficult mathematical equations known to mankind (yes, they really exist).Upon learning of Diane\u2019s suicide, Frank acts as Mary\u2019s de facto guardian, and keeping his promise to his sister, devotes his life to keeping Mary\u2019s life as normal as possible; which includes enrolling her into public school in Florida, having friends [even if her only friend is a fifty year old Motown-loving neighbour Roberta Taylor, played wonderfully by Octavia Spencer], and most of all, making a life for herself outside of her wicked mathematical talents.On Mary\u2019s first day in school, despite Frank\u2019s wishes to stay under the radar, Mary does the complete opposite of Frank\u2019s demands, acting up and showcases her math skills, immediately becoming the star-studded student of the school, especially to that of her teacher, Bonnie Stevenson (Jenny Slate) and school principle Gloria Davis (Elizabeth Marvel). Mary, unable to contain her big personality in such a little shell, is beyond herself and really not able to contain her spunky personality. Noticing her immense gift and talents, Principle Davis is willing to give Mary a free ride and ticket to a prestigious private school nearby. Frank, who gives his own very convincing case, declines all of the offers given to Mary, insisting she live a normal life filled with childhood instances, friendships and most of all, playfulness.While Frank and Mary seem to be blending into their humble and comfortable lives in Florida, both of their lives are shaken drastically with the emergence of Frank\u2019s mother (Mary\u2019s grandmother) Evelyn (Lindsay Duncan), who believes that Mary\u2019s mind is a gifted one-in-a-billion mathematical prodigy mind, who should continue her late mother\u2019s legacy and begin working, while still a child, on the Millennium Problem, given her very abstract and young handle of advance calculus problems and solutions. What continues is an ugly and emotional custody battle for Mary between her Uncle Frank and Grandmother Evelyn."

They really have a father/daughter relationship, and throughout the film we get to see how much they care for each other.

The first two acts of the movie are quite enjoyable. The plot is formulaic, as others have said, but it has charming performances and is nicely shot. It all falls apart under the complete nonsense of the third act, to the point of (fairly extreme) frustration.Who wrote the third act of this movie? Have they met other people before, or just heard about them? Are they doing well in their lives, or was this a desperate cry for help from someone who has been deprived of human interaction for far too long? Do they have even a passing knowledge of the American judicial system? At the very least have they seen another movie about a court case, or have they only heard about one from a stray radio signal in the isolation pod they've been raised in? How are we, as an audience, supposed to go on with our lives knowing there's another soul out there, somewhere in the vast wild, experiencing such unbelievable anguish?In summary, despite a good performance from the always-great Chris Evans, I now hope Thanos kills Captain America in the next Avengers movie."

He wants his niece to have a normal childhood unlike his sister who didn't have a choice except to live up to her mother's expectations! Oh yes, let's not forget his next door neighbor Roberta who is a mother figure for Mary. Let's throw in Mary's teacher Bonnie who discovers Mary's brilliant abilities and Frank's hunky looks. Let's not forget a one-eyed cat named Fred and why not throw in some foster parents? With all this you have to go to court for the 'who will win custody'---DUH!--suspense.Do you hear the violins on the soundtrack? Can you feel/see the director Marc Webb and screenwriter Tom Flynn using all the cliches to manipulate the audience? (Darn it but they fail to explain a throwaway comment about why a professor quit a lucrative job but you will know..)The surprising thing is that this movie works. It will get the laughs out of the audience and in a minute the tears will flow.The only thing missing are those violins on the soundtrack, instead getting some grating sounds here and there plus a pop tune when needed.There is no faulting the acting with Chris Evans as Frank, Jenny Slate as the teacher, Elizabeth Marvel as the school's principal, Lindsay Duncan as Evelyn, Octavia Spencer as the next door neighbor all delivering the cliches as if they are brand new, said and done for the first time. A special well done to Mckenna Grace as the 7 year old Mary, here and there precocious when needed, who delivers with the tears, anger, smiles and mathamatical smarts when called for, whether she understood the problems or not!There is one scene showing a couple of families welcoming a new baby which, though not necessary, add unexpected warmth.Shot mainly in Florida,except for one Boston scene, the film is bright with even the cliche beach, boats and bird scenes looking fresh.This weekend you will either go to the latest \"Fast and Furious\" franchise sequel or \"Gifted\" the touchy-feely 'date' movie. Guess which one I recommend?"

He plays a single man who's rearing his spirited young niece (Mckenna Grace). She's a math genius, but he's determined to raise her like a regular kid. Meanwhile, the grandmother wants to spirit her away to a life of intellectual pursuit. Grace turns in a lively, charming performance, Olivia Spencer (as the neighbor) once again successfully plays feisty, but Evans just plays it earnest without much depth. The dilemma is presented with sufficient significance, but the trite plotting, bland writing and lack of emotional resonance keep the film from achieving it's potential."

This film also acts as a fantastic jumping off point for the budding talents of the young McKenna Grace, and as a much needed landing pad for the directorial skills of director Marc Webb. It may not offer a whole lot in terms of innovating the \"child prodigy\" sub-genre, but that is not - in any way, shape, or form - to say this isn't a perfectly inoffensive and enjoyable film in its own, slightly predictable right. Here's hoping Marc Webb steers closer to more grounded, human dramas from now on, because this one is right on the money."

      "text": "At best, 'Gifted' is overly sentimental, a movie that tugs on the hearts of many movie-goers and features stellar lead performances by Chris Evans and Mckenna Grace. Director Marc Webb ('(500) Days of Summer') tells the story of a freelance boat repairer named Frank (Chris Evans) who ends up going into a legal battle with his mother (Lindsay Duncan) for custody rights for his intelligent niece Mary (Mckenna Grace), who happens to excel at solving complicated maths equations. Upon her first day at school, her teacher Bonnie (Jenny Slate) is impressed at her skill to quickly solve maths problems, but is also dismayed at her attitude towards other people. Mary isn't as sociable with people in her age group, and likes to spend most of her time with adults, since she is able to talk to them about things she finds interesting. I admired this movie enough to get on board emotionally with the characters, it's very well crafted, and at times, it can be emotional. Mckenna Grace has a bright future for someone as young as her, and she and Evans carry this movie effortlessly. The only problem here is that the story is not unique, there are other movies - arguably better ones - out there that tell these stories, and provide them with original twists. This movie pretty much walks down the path you expect it to, as far as writing goes. 'Gifted' is the kind of movie you watch for the characters and the acting, but the story could have used more of an emotional punch, and maybe a more original execution. Other than that, this is a movie not to be missed."

The acting is very good, and it presents itself with emotion and passion, and for an emotional story that is the most important part. And best of all is the relationship between our two main characters that is the build block that maintains the whole picture. As noted, it does have flaws, some scenes are clearly pointless and some of the relationships between characters apart from the main two are bland and not very well fleshed, and unfortunately they don't make the \"villain\" if you want to call it that, very relatable, which in the first place it's the issue. The fact that at no point in the film I found myself saying \"Oh, yes I can relate to her, this is clearly a tough situation\" is proof of a failure in the movie's part for presenting a compelling narrative in that aspect. Nevertheless, with good to great acting, good tracks, some laughs, and a great connection with the main characters, Gifted showcases a good emotional subject and a movie that can be clearly enjoyed. Final verdict: 7.5"

I was pleased to see Octavia Spencer also present in this film, as a neighbour who enjoys having Mary around at times - I'm a big fan of Octavia as an actress in general. The story was interesting - having seen other films about child prodigies, I empathised with the man, Frank (played by Chris Evans), who has his niece's welfare at heart. I've heard and seen enough stories about child prodigies to know it isn't always in the childs best interests to try to nurture extraordinary knowledge, to put it one way. I won't say any more so as not to provide spoilers but I did find this to be a somewhat emotive film and thus an engrossing and decent watch overall. There are some moments which some may write off as a bit too sappy, cheesy at worst but in this sort of a film, I'd say their almost mandatory and it wasn't unnecessarily maudline in a ludicrously over the top way as such. Its a thoughtful film with some good performances and I appreciated it and would recommend it to others, just be aware that there is a fair bit of jerky camerawork, which isn't great but that and the sappy moments aside, this is a really quite solid film with good performances."

But Webb is able to capture her life's story, evoking sympathy, in just a few scenes. Another part that is great about this movie are the relationships. It's hard to think of a set of characters that don't have their relationships unpacked to a certain degree, and that makes it so much more encapsulating, raw, and emotional. Not to mention stunning performances from McKenna Grace and Chris Evans, this movie is undoubtedly a 10/10."
