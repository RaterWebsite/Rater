      "text": "While aside from the awesome big battle, Spartacus may not feel much like a Stanley Kubrick film, it does feel like a moving classic Hollywood epic with great characters and iconic scenes.It's corny at times and it drags quite a bit during its three hour runtime, but manages to mantain its status as a true Hollywood classic and an important, if at times unsubtle criticism of McCarthyism from writer Dalton Trumbo (the main villain literally has a list with the names of all \"enemies of the state\")."

Also my favorite film about the Ancient Rome, the battles are spectaculars, incredible legendary actors its a true masterpiece. I would to remain after Gladiator 2000 by Ridley Scott there's no more epic and good films about Ancient Rome, I sugest to make more films about romans with this high quality. We have nowadays a lot mediocre and awful films about Rome. Spartacus, Ben Hur and Gladiator are most greatest of all the times!"

      "text": "Un p\u00e9plum typique de son temps et un long-m\u00e9trage tr\u00e8s\u2026 long (typique de son temps, on vous dit\u2026) ce qui signifie des longueurs qui rallongent encore le m\u00e9trage qui semble alors ne plus en finir\u2026 Cela \u00e9tant, il n\u2019est pas le pire d\u2019entre eux (de tous les p\u00e9plums \u00e0 rallonge) et avec un peu de bonne volont\u00e9, on tient \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s la distance\u2026 des plus de trois heures bien pes\u00e9es !On note en dehors du grand spectacle (surtout les d\u00e9placements de troupes \u00e0 la fin) une certaine violence (surtout vers la fin) avec m\u00eame du \u00ab sang \u00bb, ce qui est inhabituel en termes de p\u00e9plum hollywoodien d\u00e9clamatoire mais on note \u00e9galement quelques excellents personnages, quelques uns seulement qui donnent une grandeur et un allant inattendus : ceux de Charles Laughton, Laurence Olivier et Peter Ustinov, vraiment \u00e9patants. Kirk se d\u00e9brouille tout \u00e0 fait mais reste h\u00e9las coinc\u00e9 en mode \u00ab h\u00e9ro\u00efque \u00bb\u2026 et trop poseur.Quant \u00e0 sa douce moiti\u00e9 dans le film, m\u00eame si elle dispose apparemment de jolis attributs, elle demeure une b\u00e9casse fadasse du d\u00e9but \u00e0 la fin : crispante comme c\u2019est pas permis, chiante comme pas possible. Presque aussi chiante que la musique criarde envahissante, lancinante\u2026 bien crispante elle aussi !Malgr\u00e9 par ailleurs sa guimauve plus ou moins appuy\u00e9e, ce Spartacus n\u2019en reste pas moins assez cruel, ce qui d\u00e9note aussi en termes de p\u00e9plum (\u00e0 dormir debout) : un \u00e9trange et bien curieux m\u00e9lange donc ! je ne suis en tout cas globalement pas convaincu malgr\u00e9 de beaux num\u00e9ros d\u2019acteurs, d\u2019autant qu\u2019on sent un agenda pr\u00e9-SJW un peu trop \u00e9vident et un Crassus qui se pose trop de questions, les questions d\u2019un sc\u00e9nariste communiste, \u00e9videmment. Bref, belle tentative que tout cela mais \u00e7a reste trop lourdingue dans l\u2019ensemble."

      "text": "The Fifties and Sixties saw a proliferation of epic films made around the Bible or the Roman Empire. Based on a precise moment in the history of Rome, the Slave War, this is one of the best despite not having a comma of historical rigor.The film focuses on the historical figure of Spartacus, a Thracian slave who begins by being a gladiator and who will become famous when he takes over the leadership of a huge group of slaves who, in the middle of the Italian peninsula, revolt and desperately fight for their own freedom and the right to abandon the empire's lands. The film creates around it a huge fictional plot and a somewhat sugary romance with another slave, and emphasizes the division of the Romans and political issues. Skillfully directed by Stanley Kubrick, it's one of the most palatable films in his filmography. The film follows the entire trajectory of the revolt until its bloody end.One of the strongest points of the film is the extraordinary performance of the cast, led by Kirk Douglas in one of the roles that would give him immortal notoriety. He is perfect in the way he gave life to Spartacus, although perhaps Kubrick exaggerated the amount of pompous speeches and pouch phrases attributed to the character. Jean Simmons was excellent in the role of the slave he falls in love with and Laurence Olivier is impeccable in the role of Crassus, the famous Roman politician and consul responsible for ending the slave revolt. The film also features John Gavin, Charles Laughton, John Dall and Peter Ustinov in smaller roles, but where everyone did a job worthy of praise.Technically, it is a film full of value and extremely positive grades. Let us start by mentioning the excellent cinematography, the impeccable filming work and the magnificent colors and light that accompany the entire work, which lasts about three hours. It is in fact three hours well spent, where we rarely feel we are seeing a scene that can be removed or shortened until we reach the last half hour... in fact, from that point on, Kubrick seems more concerned with creating a hermetically closed ending in spite of using the dramatic climax for a great and impactful ending. Thus, and as a result of this hesitation, the film drags on for unnecessary thirty minutes. All the sets and costumes were meticulously done and look incredible, although, like much of the script, they are more guided by the visual impact than by the historical rigor of the recreation. As in other epics of this time, many people are involved and the film was an imposing collective effort. The soundtrack, by Alex North, is effective and works quite well."
