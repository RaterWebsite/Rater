Sky High is no exception and is about as solid of an 8 as you can get. Though I was concerned this movie was more for the kiddies than adults I was pleasantly surprised to find it catering to a full spectrum of ages. Among having good morals it was fun, and most importantly funny. Though I was not rolling out of my seat like in some movies it however was consistent and light hearted. I even liked the teenage love triangle sub plot. This movie didn't really have faults, but the acting could have been a smidgeon better than it was, and there could have a bit more depth, though I sure this is not what they were going for. All in all they accomplished what they set out to do. Make a campy movie that most people could enjoy. So please don't try to play super-critic with this one just relax and let it wash over you. And if your soul has not completely been tainted by cynicism then I guarantee you will come out of this movie with at least a smile on your face :)"

      "text": "This Disney-produced spoof about a high school for budding young superheroes has to contend with two huge, Kryptonite-like obstacles from the outset. It's the third movie in less than a year to deal with a superfamily, what with this summer's Fantastic Four handling the concept competently and last fall's The Incredibles doing so brilliantly and definitively--so enough already, already. And it's directed by Mike Mitchell, who inflicted Surviving Christmas and the original Deuce Bigalow, Male Gigolo upon the undeserving world; if you feel as I do that there's nothing more painful to sit through than a bad comedy, then those two were the equivalent of Drano enemas. Well, Mitchell must have acquired some superpowers of his own recently, because Sky High is surprisingly witty, refreshing entertainment for kids AND adults...at least two-thirds of the way. Lots of funny bits ensue as the superschool divides its students into \"heroes\" (those with impressive powers) and \"sidekicks\" (those whose powers are either nonexistent or uncool). I especially liked the self-duplicating cheerleader squad and the girl who morphs at will into an animal considerably less awe-inspiring than a lion or eagle, and found Dave Foley (TV's NewsRadio) and Bruce Campbell (the Evil Dead movies, Bubba Ho-Tep) consistently amusing as, respectively, the headmaster of sidekick school and the coach. Unfortunately, the fun drains out in the final half-hour when the movie focuses increasingly on an Archie, Betty and Veronica adolescent triangle, and the really strange, eleventh-hour \"what the hell were they THINKING?!?\" twist not only seems desperate and tacked-on, but actually negates the \"Sidekicks are People Too\" theme that the movie seems to be shooting for. There's too much about Sky High to like to totally dismiss it, but it just doesn't hold up: what a shame that, as far as superpowers go, the film starts out soaring above the clouds but eventually opts for invisibility."

      "text": "For a family-friendly comedy film, Sky High is surprisingly self-aware, often quite clever in its deconstruction of superhero mythos and packed with plenty of good jokes. The cast are great across the board - the youngsters Michael Angarano and Danielle Panabaker make likable protagonists and their characters Will Stronghold and Layla Williams actually develop over the course of the story, and the supporting cast all add something to the film. Kurt Russell and Kelly Preston look like they're having a lot of fun playing Will's super-powered parents (complete with tribute-to-Clark Kent spectacles as a disguise), Steven Strait is much better in this than he was in that colossal turkey The Covenant, and plays a pleasingly complex character, the solitary bad-boy Warren Peace, Mary Elizabeth Winstead is also good as the seemingly perfect Gwen Grayson and Bruce Campbell shouts a lot and wears some rather fetching gym shorts, which is awesome. The film works on multiple levels, as a tongue-in-cheek superhero parody, as a high-school rom-com and as a coming-of-age family drama. The finale may be a bit messy, and some of the effects a bit ropey, but that shouldn't ruin your enjoyment of this undeniably fun adventure for all ages."

      "text": "Sky High \u2013 the movie that was my favourite for a while when I was young. Now that I\u2019ve seen it again, I laughed at a few moments and was okay for the movie to be for the most part. This \u201cfor the most part\u201d is where I kind of regret seeing the movie. From a second watch, the movie had some questionable morals of the story such as the simplicity of life and the quickness life actually hits you. From what I\u2019ve gathered from the movie, it\u2019s okay that you are na\u00efve with perceptions of reality. The movie tended told me that everyone\u2019s going to directly tell me their intentions and be obvious with whom they are. I get it. It\u2019s a kids movie. I was a kid when I watched it. It\u2019s not true. Trust may be built from being together for an arbitrary length of time (in the movie, 8-9 years \u2013 I don\u2019t know what grade high school starts there), but to gain trust after it was lost should be better than \u201cyes I know what you did, I will now realize your intentions are better now that you\u2019ve spammed me with phone calls and this person that talked for you at a party is actually evil\u201d. Situations in real life this simplistic don\u2019t occur. Nothing\u2019s cut and dry as to what needs to be done for someone. There will be situations where realizing something by luck will be much too slow to say save a life, fix a relationship, or save one\u2019s own life. Deeper questioning and more time are required.To get to the bottom of someone\u2019s problems, one needs time and effort. It\u2019s not a \u201chere I am, an obvious bad guy/girl that will happen to fix your life,\u201d it should be a deep heart-to-heart conversation/dialogue talk that truly tries to get problems. Seeing reality as finding a solution to an immediate problem does not help core issues that one or another individual may have. Fixing core problems will not happen by happenchance. The more people think that an issue will resolve itself or in real life be more problematic, be solved by someone else (the bystander effect), the less likely the issue will be resolved. In the movie, the character Warren Peace is at odds with the main character Will Stronghold because of family issues. The two of them eventually become best friends. How? They won some sort of heroes vs. villains thing, then Will was sulky about having his best friend walk out on him and mentioned it to Warren how he\u2019s not going to homecoming, and now suddenly there\u2019s an evil person that\u2019s turning everyone into babies, they\u2019re all buddy-buddy. Evil is an odd choice to bring people together, but it\u2019s the way that it did bring heroes together, yay! Now I have no idea how to succeed with life! But for real, to fix, mend, or make a relationship, true conversations are needed. If no choices are made by an individual (say me), and I decide to wait for a shining moment, there is a chance that I will be passed up. Why? There\u2019s no time left. People will not generally want to inconvenience me.I would love to rat out this movie and say that it has caused all of my life problems, but if I, myself, am not willing to fix my own problems or become conscious of my reality, I can\u2019t really say that I have never played victim before. What is my suggestion to watching a movie like this? Watch it, think what you think about it and if you need guidance following the movie, ask for it/look for it sooner than later. It may not be minor and it may need time to fix. I understand if you have not made any sense out of this, but keeping shallow perceptions of reality will only hinder you later in life. Overall, I\u2019ll put this at 5.8/10."

Pretty much what you can expect from a Disney live action movie.\r Overall:\rWhile this movie doesn't compare to it's Marvel or DC counterparts, it is also not trying to. If anything, it is more a parody of the genre that steals a style of storytelling that only Disney can do."

      "text": "This is surprisingly deep and toys with cliches and stereotypes. Also has a really enjoyable story, humor and a good cast. Lets start at the beginning. It is the story of Will Stronghold who is the son of two superheroes and is a freshman in the Sky High school for people with super powers. Because he has not developed or discovered his powers  yet he is cast in the Sidekick class. Now the story unfolds. It deals with a lot of moral dilemmas, what it means to be a hero or special. I stay this vague because of spoilers. I will say the characters and story are very well interwoven. There are good twists and reveals. The characters develop themselves and learn a lot what being a hero or even a good person means. There is a lot of critique or comments in this movie with side-blows to cliches. It works well and the humor is welcome. The cast does a great job and nails there roles. I like all the Sidekicks and find them charming characters. Bonus for the well paced final and resolve. Overall a well made superhero movie that is forgotten or flies under everyone's radar. Not everything needs to be an Avengers or marvel blockbuster movie"

Ten years after it's original debut, I am STILL playing with ALL of my friends as Sky High superheroes.  I laughed so hard I had to pause the movie and take a 20 minute break, I came back with 34 of my friends (3 of which had to leave because they couldn't laugh any more.) I really enjoy their unique powers and the completely original bully aspect. Over all stellar movie and an instant classic, can't wait for the sequel!!1!!!!1"

      "text": "In the movie Sky High, Will Stronghold is a rising freshman at Sky High School. The school is for people that have super powers and there, they decide if you are a main superhero or just a sidekick. Will does not truly know his super powers when he enters the school so he ends up being put as a sidekick. Will had to hide this from his parents because Will's parents are the world's two best superheroes: The Commander, his dad and Jetstream, his mom. The moral of this film is just because someone says you are not special, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s true. Everyone is special in their own way. The film was able to disguise a great meaning throughout the entire movie.\r All the superhero characters are built like popular jock athletes. They are fit, good looking, and jerks to the sidekicks. When you look at them, you think of the popular kids from high school. Some of the superhero's powers are super speed, strength, flying and duplication. They act as though the sidekicks do not exist and pick on them for not being good enough. Warren Peace is Will\u2019s bully and one of the superheros. He has the slicked back hair, leather jacket and can get all the girls he wants. He knows he\u2019s \u201call-that\u201d and carries himself higher than the sidekicks but even a lot of the other superheros. They think they are superior to others and hold themselves on a pedestal. The sidekicks on the other hand, are the dorky, weird, overweight kids. They do not look physically like a superhero but more like an normal person. They do not believe in themselves, and they that their powers are not important since the superheroes tell them that they are useless. Some of the sidekicks power are to turning into a guinea pig, melting into goo, controlling planet life. Magenta is a side kick who can turn into a Guinea Pig when under pressure. This power is fitting for her since she is shy and timid of everyone and when she turns into a guinea pig she becomes even more skittish and smaller. The school makes sure that the superheroes get all the nice stuff, great teachers and get the praise and glory. On the other hand, the sidekicks get stuffed into a small classroom with a former sidekick that's crazy. They do not get any attention from the school and are treated like worthless students.\r Will has to deal with being brushed to the side and is bullied. Since he does not have a power yet, everyone makes fun of him since his parents were great superheroes but yet they had an average kid. One day, Will's whole life changed when he got picked on one superhero. Will ends up shoving the guy into the wall with his super strength. Will finally finds his true super power, and he moves up to the new social class,  a superhero. Will forgets about his sidekick friends and acts like he is too good for them since he is a superhero now. He becomes a snob and becomes one of the stereotypical jerk superheroes. Will has a crush on one of the sidekick girls, Layla.  But as soon as he becomes a superhero, he ignores her and acts like she does not mean anything to him. He instead falls in love with a girl named Gwen who's another superhero. He gets seduced by her because of her charming looks. She's portrayed as the perfect girlfriend for him because she's a superhero, attractive and she's the most popular girl in the school. It's ends up backfiring on him because Gwen was just using him and turned out to be an villain. Will fell for the attractive older high school superhero Gwen when he should have stayed with the shy, timid, and social awkward Layla because her style is more like him. Will didn't really know Gwen but he decided to date her because she helped him become popular and he liked the attention that everyone gave him.He got caught up on the popularity instead of staying true to his roots and morals.\rIn the end, Gwen tries to take over Sky High and the so called superheroes jerks helped her. With Gwen turning out to be a evil person and trying to take over Sky High, that shows that there\u2019s no such thing as a perfect person like Will thought she was. He thought she was smart, pretty and perfect but as we know in life, no one is perfect and everyone is always hiding something. So the only people left to save the day are the sidekicks and Will. The sidekicks don't believe at first that they can stop the villains since their whole life they have been told that they are nothing and that they aren't true superheroes. In this scene, the sidekicks are frantic and Will has to convince all the sidekicks that they actually are super and that they can take down the villains. The sidekicks were always made fun of and said that they aren't actually \"super\" but at the end of the day, they saved everyone at Sky High. They showed everyone that sidekicks could be just like superheroes and that there shouldn't be such division between the two social classes."

      "text": "We are letting it go a lot and in return we occasionally get a few morbid chuckles to survive.Sky HighThe director Mike Mitchell grabs a teenage superhero flick like a fascinating idea. Don't get me wrong, it is. The metaphors are sugar coated or more precisely cloaked or masked in a way to gather the crowd lickety split. But let's be honest. You need someone like Edgar Wright to stay true to the tone of the insanity of the genre. What Wright did in Scott Pilgrim Vs The World, is simply untouchable. The zip in his language is still untouched. And malleability, that never gives the audience room enough to be shocked or be distant with the imageries, is to be inspired from.Which by now, you can guess that this is what I had a problem with. With this film. The film's first half is incredibly transparent. And the second half exactly as we could see through, in the first. So why does it still hold on to you. It is not the good old sleazy one liners. It is not the endorsement of its concept. It is definitely not the \"I will not be that kind of a film\" attitude. It is actually daring to go where one would never go. Wise ones. And that is to still rely upon those denials.There is nothing wrong with crafting a film just to shock the viewers. Just not to give them what they get, what they expect. You can shape it however you like. The only issue, then, is with the antics that they are stepping upon. You can distract the viewers, but don't expect the distraction to be the spine of the narration. Dodging answers is not an answer. Dodging is making a choice. And choices are the worst aspect of the film. From the visual effects department to flawed characters and questionable premises they and the school and this entire world is set upon."
