So many amazing cameos, so many amazing music sequences, and so many amazing car chases make this one of the all-time best.  You have to love the rate Charles sequence, with all the dancing out in front of the music shop.  And the Rawhide sequence?  Brilliant. John Belushi is at his near peak best in this film second only perhaps to animal house."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Alright, well, here this goes. No, I didn't really like \"The Blues Brothers.\" And that's okay. I don't have to like every movie widely regarded as a classic of the American cinematic arts. In fact, I can plainly see why this one is so sweepingly adored. The infectious dance numbers, the joy-inducing cameos, the bombastic set pieces. It's all fairly enjoyable and - in fact - I enjoyed a lot of it. It's just that, even though there's a general throughline here, there's also this episodic nature to the majority of the second act that didn't really dazzle me in any way. Jake and Elwood have to go to X place and get X person to do X, they do it, and then have to go to X place and get X person to do X as well. It's all too piecemeal for my tastes. But, again, there's still a lot here to be enjoyed and \"enjoy\" I did (for the most part)."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Fantastic fusion of cast, setting, music and direction makes this an almost ageless slice of entertainment."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "The cult classic with one of the best if not best score in movie history. They got so many great artist (some would say legends) like Aretha Franklin, John Lee Hooker, Big Walter Horton, James Brown, Ray Charles and more. There is no movie that can easily compare. Also there are the songs performed by the Blues Brothers themselves which gave an awesome performance and are a welcome addition to the score. But it does not end here. They took also great effort in delivering an entertaining story, great humor, remarkable quotes and create characters you never forget. I wont spoil any of the former parts because I believe this is a movie you should experience yourself. The combination of Director John Landis and the chemistry between John Belushi / Dan Akroyd is pure gold. I will say the quote \u201cMovies like this will not be made anymore\u201d is a fitting description. Overall this is a must see movie with a must listen soundtrack you need to own for your collection. Special warning: Blues Brothers 2000 is the worst sequel I know (except the score) and the only movie that destroyed the prequel. Yes, that is possible (I couldn't believe that was even a thing before. Though only extreme fanboys say something like that). If you watched it you will know what I mean."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This movie reminds me of my childhood. We watched this as a family and laughed each time. Probably seen it over 20 times now.
