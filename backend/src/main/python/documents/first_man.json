It's also needlessly prolonged in its annoyingly too tight handheld photography which should have been more measured for effect!  Surprisingly it drags even more than epics typically do considering its new look into the real hero's personal life."

The epic length, the dialogue I had to keep rewinding and replaying at higher volumes through my stereo speakers so I could understand it, the overemphasis on melodrama involving the wife and kids, and the studied downplaying and internationalizing of what was a uniquely American triumph leaves the viewer with a feeling best summed up in one word: \"meh.\"  I am sure there is all manner of high-end filmmaking craft that effete artsy-fartsy critics might appreciate, but the movie fails in its most basic mission: to engage and entertain the viewer."

This movie spent zero time on any of the successes until the end with the successful landing on the moon. The movie itself is well made, well acted and the special effects were fine. This is this movie depicted an complete rotten life for Neil Armstrong that seemingly turns him into this nearly emotionless stoic. They should have mixed in a little bit more of the Right Stuff and show at least something of the many successes leading up to Apollo 11. The movie was highly riveting in a misleading way most of the time. The actual landing sequence was decent and I thought it was the best part in the movie. But seriously you get 2hrs of tragedy, 20 minutes of spaceflight and really nothing positive about the program. They literally spend more time discussing Russia's successes at the time than anything NASA did. It is a very adept attempt at revisionist history."

      "text": "It's almost inconceivable that a story as monumental as the first moon landing could be made boring, but, unfortunately, director Damien Chazelle has found a way to do just that. While the filmmaker's biopic about astronaut Neil Armstrong takes a different approach to its subject than that of other historic space program pictures (like \"The Right Stuff\" and \"Apollo 13\") -- one that's more quietly contemplative and less bombastically heroic -- there's still something to be said for making it engaging, and that's where the film falls flat. This overlong slog, filled with easily edited material, too many protracted shots of silent emoting and images that are often filmed far too up close, tries the viewer's patience from early on -- and never eases up in these regards. As the lonely, brooding protagonist, Ryan Gosling delivers a fine performance in portraying the character for who he is, but, when placed in the context of a story that fundamentally lacks  something to draw viewers into it, that effort is, regrettably, lost. The dark, sullen overall tone of the project does not help, either, especially in a film that showcases one of mankind's greatest accomplishments. In many ways, this plays, albeit loosely, like a film adaptation of David Bowie's \"Space Oddity,\" but, personally, I'd rather listen to the song that sit through this tedious exercise. Kudos to Chazelle for being willing to try something different, but it's too bad this didn't show up in the finished product."

It made happy and historic points of the story very sad, reflecting lots about family, and although it showed a different side of the story it definitely had issues. The movie was too long and had a very mellow tone. I can see why some people really enjoyed it but in the end, it had me disappointed."

I get it, Neil was never a talkative guy, so the portrayal, while snooze-inducing, is probably on point. Sadly, it makes for some really slow, devoid of dialog and almost lifeless passages. And those are the scenes on Earth! Neil's demeanor pretty much kills all of the drama as it happens. Completely devoid of emotion. Might be accurate, but it makes for some damn boring scenes.The scenes in space are pretty much a mix of fast cutting between zoomed in buttons and displays, a lot of shaking and the occasional view from outside the capsules. The technical details of pretty much everything is cut down to the bare minimum. Most of the time you have no idea what is going on. And the worst part is that even the moon landing itself seems so devoid of excitement that I just didn't care about it. I just wanted the movie to end!Normally, when I watch movies or documentaries on this stuff, I am almost in tears when they reach the points of great significance. Not the case for this one! I just sat there. No interest in the scene. Nothing but boredom.Bottom line: This movie is 90 minutes of Neil Armstrong getting in and out of capsules mixed with some incredibly slow-moving family moments on Earth being interrupted by calls about colleague accidents. Then he goes to the Moon, quickly skips to being back on Earth and the movie ends."

The same could be said of Apollo 13 (I was an adult for both), but that movie somehow generated suspense and empathy, which are hard to come by in First Man.  I suppose that the tale of 13 is more implicitly exciting, and that the principals were inherently more likable and even humorous at times;  I have to say I hope that Neil was actually more interesting in real life.  He is played almost entirely without affect, and would likely be diagnosed today as being somewhere on the \"spectrum\".  The space sequences are not bad, but they don't pull you in to the experience.  I'd say rent Apollo 13 instead."

The family stuff, there was some depth to that, but too much of it just came out bland and ineffective. There was definitely a great a mount of research and effort put into the NASA parts of the movie, but too much of it was procedural without any real tension.

      "text": "Aesthetically laudable, emotionally vapidMore an intimate character drama than a grandiose examination of man's place in the cosmos, First Man is more concerned with domesticity than the actual journey to the moon, attempting to demonstrate that behind the great moments of history exist personal demons and private motivations. Nothing wrong with that of course - contextualising small character beats against a larger historical canvas can produce compelling cinema. Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line (1998), for example, uses the Battle of Guadalcanal as the background against which to engage personalised existential Heideggerian philosophical conundrums, whilst Michael Mann's Ali (2001) is more interested in Ali's private struggles outside the ring than his public bouts within it. However, for this kind of storytelling to work, one thing is essential - emotional connection. The audience must, in some way, care about the people on screen, otherwise their introspective problems are more than likely to feel like they are just getting in the way of the larger story. And that's exactly what happens in First Man - there is a lifelessness at the film's core, an emotional vapidity that can't be filled by exceptional technical achievements and laudable craft.Based on James R. Hansen's, First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong (2005), the film begins in 1961, and hits all the beats you'd expect in the lead up to the Apollo 11 mission in 1969, including the death of his daughter, Karen (Lucy Stafford) from a brain tumour; his marriage problems with his first wife, Janet (Claire Foy); the lunar landing alongside Buzz Aldrin (Corey Stoll); and his private sojourn to the Lunar East crater.With this framework, the film remains tied almost exclusively to Armstrong's perspective, with the occasional shift to Janet. It sets itself the task of penetrating this most private of men, explaining why he was so driven, even to the detriment of his family. And herein lies perhaps the film's most egregious failing. It's as if director Damien Chazelle and screenwriter Josh Singer think the Apollo 11 mission isn't interesting enough by itself - there needs to be some kind of deeper \"why\" behind the whole enterprise.In any case, the attempts to tease out the inner workings of Armstrong's mind don't really work, as he remains very much in his own world - no matter what Gosling, Chazelle, and Singer do to dress him up, Armstrong comes across as aloof and interiorised. Partly at fault here is Gosling's performance, with its fulcrum of emotionless stoic masculinity. Instead of giving the character hidden depth, the few discernible traits he possesses make him something of a cardboard cut-out, a 21st-century screenwriter's idea of what an American man who grew up in the 40s and 50s should be.Another issue is that the filmmakers choose to locate Armstrong's primary motivation in the death of Karen, which is presented with a mawkish sentimentality, as Chazelle attempts to link Karen's death with Armstrong's determination - as she is dying, he holds her and looks wistfully into the sky, and on the moon's surface, he drops her bracelet into the Lunar East crater and cries a few tears. The problem lies in the overkill, detracting from whatever genuine emotion such details should evoke. Every time we see Gosling stare yearningly into the sky, the potency of the film is diluted just a little bit more.Did he really drop the bracelet into the crater? We don't know. However, for me, the whole thing comes across as far too syrupy, an amateur psychological profiling of a man who was intensely private. I would have much preferred the Lunar East trip to remain a mystery - by showing us what they think might have happened, Hansen, Singer, and Chazelle cheapen the intensely personal nature of the moment, which Armstrong obviously chose to keep secret for a reason.Make no mistake, however, the lunar landing itself is beyond spectacular, with Justin Hurwitz's incredible music and Linus Sandgren's superb cinematography coming into their own. The sequence was shot in 70mm IMAX, and it makes extraordinary use of the larger frame, with the first panorama of the lunar surface almost as awe-inspiring as anything in 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) or The Tree of Life (2011). An especially well-directed part of the lunar descent is that rather than lay down a busy foley track, Chazelle pulls out the sound altogether, creating an eerie, otherworldly moment that literally gave me goosebumps.However, despite the magisterial last 30 minutes, and some sporadically well-handled moments, First Man is underwhelming, and, for long portions, interminably dull. As good as that final sequence is, it's no compensation for the plodding and lifeless two hours that precede it."

      "text": "Space exploration movies, especially those based on a true story, are always riveting. First Man is no exception. Unlike the film Apollo 13, which explored the friendship and solidarity between Jim Lovell, Jack Swigert, and Fred Haise, this film focuses on the professional and emotional journey of one astronaut, Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling), who holds a place in history for being the first human being to set foot on the fine powder that pervades the surface of the moon.Clearly, there was teamwork involved in this endeavor as well. Armstong did not fly to the moon by himself\u2014he was accompanied by Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins. Nevertheless, even though his crewmates were with him the whole time, and the interdependency between them was obvious, Armstrong\u2019s fierce inner strength, and his laconic and terse inability to express his deepest emotions both at home and at work, depict him as an iconic loner. It was not just one small step for [a] man and one giant leap for mankind, it was a giant leap for astronaut Neil Armstrong as an individual and a man whose personal journey had literally taken him to the moon.Director Damien Chazelle beautifully balances the professional man with the private individual, who was difficult to live with as a spouse, who loved his children but could not always demonstrate paternal affection, and who respected his copilots even as he distanced himself from them. Generally unknown or forgotten details about Neil Armstrong come to light in this screenplay, such as the fact that he lost a 2-year-old daughter to brain cancer in 1962. Given his impassive and stoic personality, he was never completely able to assimilate his grief. He is shown dropping his daughter\u2019s bracelet in a moon crater during his 22-hour Apollo 11 lunar exploration. Although this scene is not wholly based on fact, Armstrong did wander away from Aldrin briefly to spend a few minutes by himself at the edge of what is known as Little West Crater. This went against the scripted actions that had been carefully planned before the launch. It was thought he might have left something there as a memento, not uncommon practice for astronauts who walked on the moon. Armstrong\u2019s biographer suspected he left something from his daughter, as did others. Also, not generally known was that Armstrong was probably not NASA\u2019s first choice to be first man. He was shoved to the head of the line with the death of Gus Grissom, who perished in a flash fire during a \u201cplugs-out\u201d test. Grissom was purported to be lined up for commanding the first lunar landing mission.As a strong-willed, hard-working Midwesterner from Ohio, Armstrong was not the easiest character to depict on screen. He was not glamorous or flamboyant, his life was scandal-free, and he avoided the limelight. Ryan Gosling attempts to recreate this inner and dispassionate strength, which was a kind of discrete reserve worn like a protective armor. The portrayal is accurate, but for those who have never experienced the quiet, unflappable self-restraint of a certain kind of Midwestern personality, it may have appeared that Gosling was underacting. He wasn\u2019t. As for Claire Foy in the role of Armstrong\u2019s wife Janet, she has demonstrated what appears to be an infinite acting range. She has effortlessly glided from a flawless portrayal of the young Queen Elizabeth II to an equally flawless portrayal of a Midwestern (from Illinois) suburban housewife who has to stay home to mind the kids, bravely live her life in the dark shadow of possible widowhood, and give her difficult astronaut husband a ton of support. Also noteworthy, the moon landing scenes and the eerie silence of space as the astronauts approach the lunar surface make this film an almost mystical experience."

      "text": "Just what kind of man must you be not only to undergo the first ever Moon landing, but to do it with such a lack of fear despite having an insight into the amount of risks you undertake. Neil Armstrong, at least how he was portrayed by Ryan Gosling here, was such a man.The first few scenes depict him flying a rocket plane when it inadvertently bounced off the atmosphere. He has a brush with death as he attempts to land it in the Mojave Desert. He succeeds, but for a man who has just been in the atmosphere a couple of minutes ago, then had a near-fatal crash, he was unmoved. Some people find this bland, but I find it fascinating. Not to mention the power of the scene was helped by Justin Hurwitz's ambitious score and Damien Chazelle's precise direction. The noises were brief, hard-hitting, the cogs could be heard breaking apart and the frames were mostly stationary feeling like an impact.The film is also careful to make sure to keep you entertained even during the times when Neil is not in the cockpit. Of course, these moments are not as tense, they can't be, but Damien Chazelle crafts his opaque personality in a clever way. Early in the film, he loses Karen, his two-year-old daughter, to a brain tumor. This is the first of the many funeral scenes in the film. Throughout the film, he only mentions her once, to his colleague, Ed (Jason Clarke), but you can feel he is always thinking about her.Somehow, Gosling's content portrayal carries this film. He remains apparently unmoved to the countless deaths of astronauts testing the Apollo Mission rocket, he always keeps a certain distance from his family. His wife, Janet (Claire Foy) is the one who from time to time breaks his wall and she is truly strong. But his pain does not come from fear to his job, as he loves it, but from loss. Always looking up at the Moon, maybe, just maybe, thinking that Karen is somewhere over there.This might seem far-fetched, but his ambition is brought by pain. In the final scenes, when he steps on the Moon, he looks around as if he is not impressed, but disappointed. There is nothing and in the end, he drops Karen's bracelet on the ground and realizes this is it. This is all there is to it."

Neil Armstrong wasn't too charismatic so I understand why Gosling chose to play him with this stoic attitude and empty stares. He also showed very real emotions in a couple of more dramatic scenes. But in the end this character wasn't really that interesting. I agree that trials of getting to the moon are shown in a thrilling manner. I disagree that the landing on the Moon in this movie was particularly spectacular. It was OK, but kinda meh. The surface of the Moon is cratered, grey and dusty - that's it. The real fuss was about the emotional journey. In this movie the screenwriter and director decided to tell the story from the point of a family drama. This is the strongest aspect of the movie. Armstrong is portrayed as someone who didn't manage to cure his daughter, so he is determined to go to the moon despite all the odds. We saw him searching for the treatment for her. In his opinion he probably failed her. So it is a promise he made (to himself / to her?) that he will never fail again. I know that people make a lot of strange stuff \"for their loved ones\" and a lot of times those things are like an ego driven wishes, dressed up as a tribute to lost ones. I'm OK with it. But it was almost the only thing that kept this movie arc together. The movie tries to base it's emotional payoff on a very oscar-baity scene, that nobody can confirm ever happened in real life. So is it a lie?, probability?, assumption ??? Not a good way to end the journey. It's not a bad movie. It's a bit slow and blurs the lines between real events and pure fantasy. The ending was just to emotionally manipulative for me and clearly an oscar-bait."

However, for me personally, the choice to make the movie more documentary like in cinematography didn't pay off as well as I would have hoped. At the beginning it was OK, but as the movie progressed it sometimes felt like the cinematography was part of a low budget \"let's not have too many special effects\" choice. The shocky images even made me nauxious from time to time watching it in the theater. For me the acting in the movie saved it from an even lower grade.

The effects in this movie are very well done and I don't blame the film for winning an Oscar. Maybe the truth is that the songs and sounds don't appear much here and that the film will be drawn to the end, but it is still a very well-made film with great acting performances."

      "text": "First Man (2018), a newly released biopic on the Space Era Neil Armstrong, from self-claimed film auteur and Academy Award-Winning Director, Damian Chazelle (La La Land), hits all the marks for a successful box office take in the current climate. First Man has already received nominations for best film from the Oscar-campaign-launching, Venice International Film Festival (Golden Lion Award) and the massive Toronto International Film Festival (The People\u2019s Choice Award).Oscar-winning, La La Land composer extraordinaire, Justin Hurwitz, returns to the Chazelle fold, bringing slightly more than is required for effect with a mesmerizing First Man score. Hurwitz creates such a beautiful composition it is easy to overlook its occasional intrusiveness. Linus Sandgren (Best Cinematography Oscar for La La Land)  is also back with his roving camera movement which is a bit dizzying. For the most part, despite a jar or two (not surprising with Sandgren\u2019s camera shooting style) Editor Tom Cross, kept the flow fairly continuous, if not seamless. And, last but not least, Canadian-born actor, Ryan Gosling, resumes his La La Land Sebastian minimalist acting style, as Neil Armstrong. Jason Clarke and Kyle Chandler provide excellent supporting characters as Edward Higgins White and Deke Slayton. Claire Foy turns in the film\u2019s deep, emotional performance as Janet Armstrong, wife of Neil Armstrong, that the other characters either don\u2019t bring or can\u2019t bring to the story. Gosling almost gets there! The costuming, hair, makeup and production design all add credence to the depicted period in a convincing manner.All in all, First Man is a nicely done film and it moves Director Chazelle up a notch on the Hollywood list of bigger budgeted films. Surprisingly, or unsurprisingly, Steven Spielberg received an Executive Producer credit. Nevertheless. the opening sequence, glaringly fails. The imagery is blatantly and conspicuously shot in an empty studio. I know Chazelle felt the lack of a bigger budget with La La Land not only curtailed his efforts but hamstrung his vision of a big-production, Hollywood-style musical of yesteryear. I like all three of Director Chazzelle\u2019s full-length, feature films; Whiplash (2014) La La Land (2016) and First Man (2018).As I watched the credits roll yesterday night, I noticed the film was based on the New York Times Bestseller First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong from James R. Hansen (who seemingly makes a cameo in the film). Josh Singer [The Post (2017) and Spotlight (2015)] gets credit for the screenplay. In my opinion, the best part of the film, by far, is the special effects. And Chazelle shot on 35MM with IMAX cameras.The spectacular rocket launches and the use of mirror-effects heighten sensibilities. Furthermore, the use of smoke and gasses also added a deft sense of the surreal and a touch of dream logic. Also, Chazelle pumps in some nice archival footage and effectively utilizes foreshadowing with early frames of daytime, lunar shots. Screenwriter Singer also weaves some heady lines referencing an often under-reported and underappreciated aspect of the Space Program and NASA. Rory Kennedy\u2019s documentary, Above and Beyond: NASA\u2019s Journey to Tomorrow recently aired on Discovery Channel, October 13th, and details NASA\u2019s mission as a viable reporting agency on the health of Planet Earth and Singer encodes this concept as Armstrong is asked, \u201cWhy do we explore and travel in space?\u201dSmartly crafting a timely topic of space exploration and NASA, Chazelle and company manage to bring the vessel home and to fruition with another buzz-worthy, award-contending product with First Man. What the film does well, it does very well! Warmly recommended."

While most of the major reveals are known, it still seems as though not many people are aware of Neil's struggles. There isn't any \"Oh **** reveals, but most dramas don't need any. The film is slow, that doesn't mean its boring. The visuals are excellent."

Damien Chazelle is putting himself in the conversation for one of the best young film makers of our time. Every shot is perfect with specific lighting choices that added to the impact of certain scenes. It's not easy to get me emotionally invested within the first 20 minutes but the way Gosling portrays Neil Armstrong really got me early and often and Claire Foy is just as good if not better. I can't sing this films praises high enough it's a must see. Overall a 10 an A+(currently my favorite film of 2018)."

      "text": "As a massive fan of Damien Chazelle's previous works ie Whiplash and La La Land, First Man is, unfortunately, his first dud and a massive disappointment. The issue with First Man is that it overall has a pretty tame direction, and a story that really doesn't spring to life despite the remarkable achievement of its main hero. That hero, of course, is Neil Armstrong, played very well by Ryan Gosling, but is so devoid of life and lacks any substantial relationships that make First Man an overall tired pointless films that does very little with the material that is on offer. Whilst Chazelle does manage to make a lot of the action very tense and helps deliver strong performances by Gosling and Claire Foy, the amount of negatives outweigh the film as a whole. For example, the film begins with plentiful amounts of shaky cam and extreme close-ups that make the film very disorientating. Whilst this technique is great during the action scenes where we feel the vulnerability of the astronaut's craft, it makes little sense during the domestic scenes where the film just decides to focus on the faces of the characters most of the time. Another problem is that the plot of the film documents the time between 1961 to the first apollo mission, but little character and relationships are developed during the time, making it a snore for most of the time. The film could have easily explored the relationship between Janet or Buzz Aldrin with Neil Armstrong, but this is instead neglected and most of the side characters are nothing than mere plot devices or stereotypes (namely Buzz who acts like this hot shot throughout the film but never has one meaningful conversation with Neil at all!). Instead, most scenes or set pieces act like montages of everything Armstrong did leading up to Apollo 11. Another problem is that the film tries really hard to inject emotion through the death of his daughter. Whilst some people might think that is emotional or deep, I found it super forceful and given that Neil was a stoic character to begin with, the whole relationship thing with his dead daughter felt unearned and often quickly forgotten. Some of the CGI at the end was pretty bad and was unnecessary but the final space sequences was quite good. As Chazelle is obsessed with jazz and music, I found the music choices suprisingly dull and a bit of a hit and miss throughout the film. Most of the meaningful score only comes at the end when Apollo 11 happens. I suppose the film also has a pacing issue because Chazelle decides to focus on some aspects for a very long time ie the Gemini 8 test flights, whilst Apollo 11 actually feels very rushed. Perhaps the biggest problem is that Neil Armstrong is arguably not really an enduring character and there is nothing really meaningful to say about him. He is stoic and straight to the point, but one that never really grows or one that the audience learns anything more about him even by the end of the film.First man is an overall bland experience which I did not expect after seeing Chazelle's previous works. Where the previous films had a main theme of characters with a craft driven to obsesssion and having to sacrifice their relationships, the problem with the 'Armstrong story' is that we all know what happens - he becomes a global hero and has a happy albeit reclusive life. There is nothing really more to say. If the film decided to focus more on the struggles to get to the Moon and more on Armstrong with the other astronauts (such as who wants to land first/whilst their colleagues kept dying) then I personally think that would've been a better film. First Man unfortunately won't be coming first in terms of this year better films..."

As majestic as the backdrop is, this film is as grounded as it gets, but not in a good way. Character studies have their value, but Armstrong, while an important man, while an iconic man, a First Man, is just not interesting man."

His third feature film, 'First Man,' is an extraordinary achievement in filmmaking and immediately becomes a front-runner for best movie of the year.The technical aspects of the film are flawless.  Everything from the writing to the cinematography to the sound design and score are as compelling as they are precise.  Yet it's the pacing and emotion of the film--which are directly a result of Chazelle's exceptional directing--that complete the package, making 'First Man' his most audaciously planned and executed project to date."

It's beautifully shot and an extremely intense first-person account. Claire Foy is incredible.  It simply lacked much of the excitement that films like The Right Stuff had locked down."
