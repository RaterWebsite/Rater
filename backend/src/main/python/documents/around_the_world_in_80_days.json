      "text": "God, what a f.cking piece of sh.t. I'm a fan of Verne's novel, and they've just butchered it. Again. Oh well, that's Hollywood for you. De France and Jackie Chan are the only ones who actually do well. Possibly because they're not taking their roles seriously and they're just in it for the money. They were wasted on this crap."

      "text": "I was hoping  Around the World in 80 Days would bring more adventure, but it was a quick tour through just a few countries. Surprisingly it had lots of known actors sprinkled around the movie witch made it interesting, but besides that nothing really made it stand out."

      "text": "Even though this movie isn't the greatest, I must admit that I was pleasantly delighted by it. I really found myself giggling as we embarked on our global trip. Since there were so many supporting appearances, it was exciting to see who would appear next. Jackie Chan is a genuinely gifted actor. The brutality was a little lighthearted, but the results were real. I liked how each nation became magical as they departed for the next."
