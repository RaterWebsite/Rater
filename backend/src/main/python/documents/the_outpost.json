The Battle of Kamdesh, as it was known, was the bloodiest American engagement of the Afghan War in 2009 and Bravo Troop 3-61 CAV became one of the most decorated units of the 19-year conflict.", "releaseYear": "2020", "mpaaRating": "R", "imageUrl": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/hPkqY2EMqWUnFEoedukilIUieVG.jpg", "categories": {"plot": 9.333333333333334, "acting": 6.666666666666667, "ending": 5.0, "soundtrack": 5.0, "cinematography": 5.0, "familyFriendly": 3.0, "funny": 10.0, "action": 7.0}, "reviews": [{"rating": "7", "text": "Nothing spectacular, but features some creative and gritty battle sequences, and pays tribute to the fallen heroes."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "The Outpost is based on true events that happened around one of the most northern US military camps in Afghanistan. The camp was poorly placed and wasn't safe to defend, causing many soldiers to lose their life. And eventually, the series of errors lead to a catastrophe.The movie is expertly shot, using long uninterrupted shots instead of many cut frames. Explosions, military gear, wounds and tactics look realistic. The viewer gets to know the characters through dialogue and events, making a connection with these men as they are put in harms way. An impressive movie! I give it a 9/10."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "An objectively bad movie, bad writing, bad directing, the actors did the most of what they were given, this is a B movie made into a D movie by sheer laziness.

We are in a time now that the war on terror is 20 years long and still going. And this film can hit us closer to the vest because it\u2019s our sons and daughters that are involved and can be involved in the same war you\u2019re watching on film. It was shot with such authenticity of the crude deployment humor and brotherhood along with the seriousness of battle that it has to be one of the best war films ever shot.
