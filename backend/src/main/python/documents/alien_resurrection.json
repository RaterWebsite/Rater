The most infuriating part for me was the captain with the hairy shoulders getting smashed in the back of the head by the aliens retractable jaw, then with a constipated look on his face proceeds to pull out a piece of his brain, stare at it for a moment before crumple to the ground, it was totally ridiculous. Granted it had some tidy special effect work going for it but not even that can redeem it in any way in my eyes, I saw it as the biggest betrayal to the franchise, bland and uninspiring, it missed the point that made it's predecessors good in my eyes and when I say predecessors I also count Alien 3 the DC edition because that was actually a great watch.

Its a film that will make you grim and moody in a happy sunny day."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "After seeing Alien 3, I thought that the Alien franchise was running out of new ideas and Alien Resurrection seems to recycle the same plotline from previous Alien movies but I still enjoyed watching it. The Aliens are back in this movie (don't know why this movie is called Alien Resurrection since there's more than one Alien again. Should be called Aliens Resurrection) and they seem to have the same motive as before: breed, prey on humans and make everyone's lives a little bit more uncomfortable. Having Aliens in the movie rather than one Alien does make the movie a little bit more exciting but doesn't really produce any scares, due to the fact I've seen these monsters in 3 movies although they still look gruesome. The movie takes place straight after Alien 3 where scientists attempt to clone Ripley and extract the Alien Queen inside her. This movie has got to be the most disturbing in the series and seeing the sleeping naked Ripley clone inside a glass tube was creepy if a little bit sexy. Just looking at the scene where Ripley and the mercenaries discover the failed attempts to clone Ripley in glass chambers and one clone lying on the table, with a deformed body saying \"kill me\" in a desperate voice. I cringed a little bit but thank god the other not so grotesque main Ripley clone torches the room with a flamethrower. The Alien queen makes a return and just serves the same purpose as in Aliens: She produces eggs which then spit out facehuggers and, you know the story. This movie's plot is a bit predictable: the human gets hugged by a facehugger and then an Alien hatches and kills everyone in sight thing, has been done 3 times. I thought the story was fine and it was enjoyable to see the Aliens again attacking in large numbers and the mercenaries fighting them off rather than another plot like the 1st and the 3rd Alien movies. The movie really gets going straight away, as soon as the Alien queen was extracted from Ripley; you don't really have to wait long until the whole terror of the Alien swarm start to engulf the screen and start attacking our heroes. The effects in the underwater scene where the Alien swims underwater and tries to catch up with his prey were quite good. Where Alien Resurrection is set is natural for an Alien film but it's a bit repetitive. It even recycles a bit of the plotline from the first movie where Call (another android like Bishop from Aliens and Alien 3) sets the spaceship on a collision course to Earth, much like the spaceship in Alien that was set to blow up to stop the Alien from escaping. I thought the acting was good - I enjoyed seeing Ron Perlman playing a bad tempered mercenary, having seen him first in Hellboy. Ripley played once again by Sigourney Weaver was a little bit less of a heroine in this one than in Aliens since she has a link with the Aliens. She now has enhanced strength, acidic blood and can smell an Alien from a mile away and can even tell if a human has an Alien inside him or her. She seems to accept that she now has a link with the Aliens produced and theoretically, she is their mother because she gave birth to their queen: She even says to an Alien host, Pervis, \"I'm the monsters mother\" while slightly grinning. This movie does inject some originality into its Alien character design with the introduction of the Alien/Human hybrid which is what you get if you give an Alien queen a female humans womb, then let it give birth. This Alien/Human hybrid looks like a white ape and doesn't kill anyone except for its mother, due to the fact that Ripley is the \"proper\" mother of the Aliens. This movie just like the previous movies is gory; the scene where the Alien/Hybrid gets sucked out of the ship through a tiny hole in the ship is especially gory. He has very little screen time so I didn't really see why they put him in it. This is not a suspenseful, horror movie like Alien and Alien 3. I have to compare this movie to Aliens due to the fact that there is more than one Alien again unlike Alien and Alien 3 but there is nowhere near as much action in this movie than there was in Aliens but at least there is some action with the mercenaries and the Aliens. I still prefer Aliens because it had a better plot but I really have to confess this: I think this is the 2nd best movie in the franchise, beating Alien by a fraction. I just thought it was a little bit more exciting and a lot more was happening to keep me entertained rather than just waiting for something to happen in Alien but do not think for one second that I don't like Alien because I do. Alien Resurrection's ending wasn't that good: Ripley has a standoff with the Alien/Human hybrid and then the Alien/Human hybrid gets sucked out of the spaceship through a tiny hole and then Ripley and Call land on Earth. The ending isn't as good as the previous Alien movies.

While it may have more action to it than its predecessor, Alien: Resurrection does to the franchise what the '90's Godzilla did to that one.  Performances are comedically hollow, starting with Wynona Rider whose entrance into the film series seems to be an attempt to pass the lead role of Sigourney Weaver to her.  Instead, Weaver's passable performance only serves to further juxtapose how utterly dreadful all the rest are.

One last ride but knowing full well the Ripley saga was truly wrapped up in the last one. Again though, as is the case with this franchise, this film has its own personality, look, feel and genre to call its own.Ripley is a superhero now, and she's explained as emotionally autistic so as to not question why she's so benign the whole film (it's clear Whedon knew not to have her slinging quips the whole film, but he didn't know what else to do with her so he turned her into a superhero, surprise). Whedon apparently complained about the delivery of his lines in this film but I don't know. I think most of the actors are game and his dialogue is just OK.The bigger problems are the lazy plotting (really, 200 years in the future the company still wants an Alien and they still weren't prepared for acid blood? or had a contingency plan in place...) and the lack of characterization of Ripley. There's nowhere else to take her. The only interesting thread involves Ripley kind of becoming an Alien queen at the end (there's mention of cross hybrid DNA) but this an end game play and it's interesting, it's just too bad it doesn't take up more room in the overall film.Jeunet is not suspense generator, nightmare-maker, or an action stager. He has some pretty sets, and does well with the beautiful Alien special effects (not the CGI though, shudder). The only indelible image in the whole thing is the final shot of the new white Alien thing getting sucked out of a tiny hole. That looks painful, and it's harrowing to watch - notice that Ripley is almost crying seeing it. It's almost like the film made Ripley a mom again only to have her rip it away from herself, but I'm not entirely sure the film understood that, or knew what to do with it."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Alien: Resurrection has some great memorable scenes (underwater aliens! chestbuster meets head!) and is ultimately quite an entertaining monster movie. That said, however, it's \"let's walk from A to B and escape\" style plot does nothing for the franchise as a whole, and there are more than enough misfiring moments to drag the whole package down to 'inconsequential'. Alien: Resurrection is not a bad film but it's nowhere near great either."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "The only real praise I can give the fourth instalment in the Alien series is that after re-watching it, it's not quite as bad as I remembered it. It's not quite a bad film, but is incredibly mediocre, with lazy plotting, a sub-par script (from the usually immaculate Joss Whedon) and paper-thin characters. The aliens look better than they ever have, however, and Dominique Pinon and Ron Perlman give good performances, along with some first-class hamming from Brad Dourif. Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet's usual post-apocalyptic steampunk aesthetic style should be well-suited to the Alien universe, but though it's striking, it sometimes comes across as a poor imitation of the work of Terry Gilliam or series mastermind Ridley Scott. Tragically, for the first time in the series, Sigourney Weaver looks bored, the passion for the role as Ripley having completely left her eyes, likely due to the ridiculousness of the character's resurrection in this film. Winona Ryder is also pretty awful, woodenly delivering her dialogue and unable to convey any kind of emotion, and the predictable twist involving her character does not make up for this lacklustre performance. Resurrection commits its worst atrocities in the final ten minutes, which are truly moronic, and succeeds only in completely castrating the alien threat and removing all menace and jeopardy. While a couple of scenes work (the sequence where multiple aliens hunt down survivors underwater is thrilling, and Ripley's shocking discovery in an abandoned science lab is an effective moment of pathos), a criminal amount of the film's runtime feels like it has been copied from earlier Alien instalments, or pasted from other unfinished projects - a telltale sign of Resurrection's troubled production. With such talent behind a project like this, the final film should be much better, but at least it provided Whedon with inspiration for a far more satisfying future project - the uninspiring rag-tag crew of space pirates we follow in this film were developed into the wonderful cast of characters in Firefly, and that is something to be truly thankful for."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Alien: Resurrection looks like something Joel Schumacher would make with all the style and and no soul.

Resurrection. This picture idea needed to remain dead. Don't get me wrong, I had a good laugh watching it and I was even entertained.

The product makes money, so you turn to the accountant types to 'package' the next version of cool aid, hence removing the originality from the product that made the big bucks to begin with. Or, we could call it a resurrection.\rDirector Jean-Pierre Jeunet is brilliant, I like all his other movies. Truly imaginative and creative like no other films. The cinematographer, Darius Khondji, is a genius. Simply turn off the volume and watch any images from this film on their own merit. The guy's work should be hanging from a museum. The digital effects and production design were superb. The ships are believable and the environment convincing. You feel like you are in there. And finally, we get to the script. Joss Whedon's script... Ok. So, Alien 3 might have aimed a couple notches too far towards the dramatic aspect of what was always intended as a fun thriller with good action in it. And I am definitely a fan of Whedon's work. All that being said. Alien is not Firefly. Campy works for the space pirates, not with the legacy of Ridley Scott, James Cameron, and David Fincher.\rLooking back at all this highly talented pieces of the puzzle, it's easy to see why they don't fit at all.

I'm talking about Delicatessen and Amelie here. Go have a look. Tell me where you see an alien and a space ship in there?\rAnd Whedon's character's structure? The space pirate types? They board a military grade ship in a renegade top mission? Seriously, that was the best idea all that studio money could come up with?\rLook, I do own the Firefly DVD collection, I love it. But make your own judgment on this. Go watch a random episode of Firefly and then have a view of Ridley Scott's Alien.

It might not have been a bad idea if they would have shown this transition of acceptance, to allow the audience to accept her they same way. The \"new\" alien idea was just daft and ugly, I'm sure H.R. Giger read the script and just design it with same effort as the writers. Winona Ryder  and Ron Perlman are perhaps the only characters that are interesting adding a bit of fun and class to an otherwise bland cast.

But now, with so many people dying, it was just another death among the many. Perhaps I should stop watching movies like these before I get too numb to care.\rThe story hovers somewhere between the funny and the scary, a sentiment that is strengthened by the fact that I watched it on commercial television, which meant that every fifteen minutes the pacing was broken by the same beer commercial: I am still pondering if the advertisement detracted from the fun or not.\rThe cast does a decent job really, with Weaver acting out her weird human/alien breed attitude, Perlman being sufficient gruff and rude, and the small Ryder being nasty and vulnerable at the same time. The rest of them are just meat for the grinder. Dourif acts the mad scientist, a role he later reprises as Wormtongue in the Lord of the Rings. His comical over the top role is probably one of the reasons this movie isn't as scary as it could be, which is especially important when he comments on a key scene in the movie: the birth of the new alien/human hybrid, which is witnessed by Weaver at the same time and turns the whole event into a comical farce.\rThe biggest problem with the movie is the abysmal script coupled with the bad directing. The script is run-of-the-mill: evil organization wants to breed homicidal aliens on a space station, the aliens escape and go on a killing spree, while a group of survivors makes a break for the spaceship that is located at the other end of the spacestation before the spacestation crashes onto earth while being thinned by the ravenous aliens.\rThe director, who made a debut with excellent movie Delicatessen, isn't fit to direct movies like this: a big budget action horror movie. It is just not his cup of tea. The camera shots are just boring, the music is dull and the art is a weak redo of the Giger art, lacking his touch of brilliance. Which is especially noticeable when the new breed of Aliens pops up, despite Giger's praises for it: it just looks bad.\rThe movie might have done better with a smaller cast and less aliens, especially in full view of the camera. Weaver's mixed human/alien features should have allowed for more duplicity and infights in the group, just as Ryder's secret should have. Can they be trusted? Will they turn against the group?\rIt is here where the movie noticeably fails and could have shined by spending more time to develop a tension that leads to disaster. But nothing comes of it.\rThe movie ought to be watched with pretzels and beer.

I would recommend to only die-hard alien fans."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "So ALOT of people hate this film, I've noticed. Ive seen alot of people on YouTube completely annihilate this movie in some overly hilarious reviews. Its campy, over-the-top and almost a complete separation in terms of style from the first 2 entries.Much like Alien 3, all the characters are body bags to be killed so they're not memorable. The gore is over-the-top and some of the performances are comically bad (Brad Dourif). Sigourney Weaver is fantastic as always but this film's biggest issue seems to be an apparent clash of styles between Joss Whedon's script and the direction.Of course, Whedon says it wasn't his fault but has anyone noticed whenever something goes bad and Whedon is involved he blames everyone but himself? Basically Alien Resurrection isn't a great film. Its not as bad as people make it out to be but its not that great either or even good enough to be \"okay.\" Its just kind of there."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "The 2 last movies just dont have the same climate as the 2 first ones.\rIf you hate long texts here is the short version: The movie errors, things left unexplained, weak aliens and the super-soldier rippley mad this movie a waste of time IMO.\rHere is the long and detailed version of my critic:\rSo, first of all...we have a cloned ripley with an alien queen being removed from her chest....that was my first problem with this movie. She suicided to end forever the alien threat, but they simply made a BACKUP. Yes, a backup, not a clone. The cloning part..? ok, but how the f*ck did they create her with the queen inside? shoudn't it have been only rippley?  And talking about this, rippley became a super soldier (she had entreme agilty, super-strenght, super smelling ability, acidic blood, I dont understand why they dont added x-ray vision too. Althought there is an \"explanation\" to this, it was boring, she losed her sense of things around her (what I mean is: things that she would NEVER talk, like when she smiling and saying \"Im her mother\", being proud of it. It just wasnt her style). At the part where the crew were underwater, that was just too unrealistic, several minutes underwater, like it was nothing.  The android gets shot, fall on the water static but appears out of nowhere to open the door on the other side (and that's because it was supposed to be the only way..).  She encouters her clones, and her blob sister tell rippley to kill her. No, just a bullet on the head wont do, she NEED to burn her.  Now we talk about the aliens. They're smart, cute, scary, angry, intelligent and now, fragile like paper. Of course they escaped, caused trouble and died. The queen got smashed by that gross thing that she generated. In comparison tho the Alien's queen and aliens, they were pretty weak and less scarier. About the gruesome newborn alien...i really dont have words to express my feeling. It was distasteful, gross and I was really dissapointed. It just smashed the queen's head like you smash a mosquito. Then it develop feelings for rippley, crush the scientist's head and meanwhile I wonder: how the f*ck in this world did it was created? Yes, there is a queen with a womb and it would be an interesting explanation, but...the queen had a womb, humans have womb too, but to create a baby (human or not) you need a thing that its called sperm. Did the scientist had sex with the alien queen? Was it a god miracle? I think I dont want to know if he really had sex with her. Anyways. I aways heard people talking good about this movie, but as a huge alien fan, I was dissapointed, very, very dissapointed."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I haven't seen it since it came to the theatres, and I remember being mildly disappointed, but still enjoying it. I'd certainly revisit it soon, with my son, since both of us enjoyed Alien and Aliens so much."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Meh  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}, {"rating": "5", "text": "I was glad that Ripley gets \"resurrected\" so when i watched this movie i thought could ripley be her self again? Nope......cause some company clones her. Now she's on the bad side? Yep but then she realizes human feelings and has a good heart and that's one thing that the script got right, the action sequences are  good. The thing i hate in this movie is Ripley tries to be funny at times BOO! she's okay in this movie. Alien 3 SUCKS!!!!!!! The original writers of Alien kill Ripley! who thought that was a good idea? Grade C-"}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Honestly, I don't think this movie is that bad. Sure it has tons of problems with it's plot but it has a decent set design, some pretty cool effects, and I also really like the fact that they make the Xenomorphs look a lot more realistic in this. It's definitely not a great movie, but it's at least a lot better than Alien 3."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Es simplemente mala. Esta pel\u00edcula arruino la franquicia, en comparaci\u00f3n Alien3 es una obra maestra. Alien3 a la mitad le gusto a la otra mitad no, pero esta cosa es simplemente horrible. Lo principal es que no hay menci\u00f3n de nada, no se sabe que paso con los marines ni con la compa\u00f1\u00eda, absolutamente nada. Una de las peores cosas es el clon de Ellen Ripley, antes ella era un humano y no me refiero por lo del ADN, ahora parece una maquina asesina sin emociones, antes ella pod\u00eda sentir miedo, tristeza, amor, emociones, ahora no tiene nada de eso. La \u00fanica vez que se siente que es humana es cuando ve a sus clones defectuosos pero despu\u00e9s de eso no lo menciona, como si nunca hubiera pasado. La historia tiene poco sentido, como clonaron a Riple y a la reina Alien a la vez? no pod\u00edan solo con uno? acaso la sangre humana se mezclo con la del Alien? como? Esta pel\u00edcula es tonta, no tiene mucho sentido, y el final es malo, la mejor parte de Alien3 fue el final, inconcluso pero mil veces mejor que el de esta \"pel\u00edcula\". Le doy un 02/10 por ser una \"secuela\" de Alien y Aliens. Y si tu eres uno de los que les gusto la pel\u00edcula pues mira las pel\u00edculas life action de Resident Evil por que son una historia y trama similar. Una chica al inicio aparece desnuda, de hay se encuentra con una s\u00faper amenaza Aliens/Zombies y tiene que escapar y exterminarlos. Si te gusto m\u00edralas, seguro que te parecer\u00e1n obras maestras mientras que en el mundo real seguir\u00e1n siendo malas."}], "recommendations": ["the_predator", "alien_covenant", "predators", "prometheus", "war_of_the_worlds", "the_darkest_hour", "skyline", "jurassic_world_fallen_kingdom", "jurassic_world_dominion", "species", "terminator_salvation", "transformers_age_of_extinction", "the_last_days_on_mars", "hellbound_hellraiser_ii", "aliens", "star_trek_v_the_final_frontier", "jurassic_world", "district_9", "monsters", "transformers_the_last_knight", "the_tomorrow_war", "monster_hunter", "daybreakers", "riddick", "the_cloverfield_paradox"]}
