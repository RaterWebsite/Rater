      "text": "Why does this exist and if it had to why couldn\u2019t just be direct to DVD? Ice Age The Meltdown is like does Land Before Time sequels pointless and little purpose to existing. Most of the jokes aren\u2019t that funny, the story is drawn out, most of the new characters aren\u2019t interesting, and its dull and eye rolling most of the time. The frustrating part is that the animation is really good and this was a studio project. Also, its Blue Sky\u2019s first sequel and this was their chance to show they put effort into their sequels by giving us something on par with Shrek 2. Unfortunately this is one of those forgettable, skippable sequels. Unless you are a child who loved Ice Age this is one film you can afford to miss."

When Shrek 2 made $910 million worldwide everyone got interested in it... but what about this movie? Why am I giving it a 10/10? The movie isn't flawless as I feel it won't appeal to a lot of people, but this is a groundbreaking CGI animated film. This is the first animated movie that created actual expressive characters, it wasn't just a collection of billions of polygons but characters felt ALIVE. The film's plot is a magical retelling of Noah's Ark biblical story and will please animated movie fans and young kids."

      "text": "This film is set in the end of the Ice Age and is a sequel to \"Ice Age\". In this film, the animals will have to survive and head out of the glacier, which is melting quickly. Directed by Carlos Saldanha, has voice actors like Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, Queen Latifah and Denis Leary.This film is not recommended for people who did not like much of the original film, it is basically more of the same, with the aggravating circumstance of the story is not so interesting, although it is easier to understand for young children. The central characters are the same who carried out the original film, and the criticism did still apply: Diego and Manfred are the most mature and interesting, while Sid continues spoiling the film with uninteresting jokes and stupid scenes. Scrat is still funny, but it cannot hold the film alone (well, he didn't even hold his nut for long...). To this set now comes a female mammoth Ellie, and a couple of pretty funny possums, capable of good moments of humor.The work of animators is regular and fulfills its role. The voice actors did a good job, particularly Queen Latifah, that gave Ellie a very sonorous voice, feminine and pleasant to hear. The soundtrack does not stand out in the film."

La trama refleja una de las crudas realidades de Venezuela, la cual son los secuestros; y que tiene muy recientes ejemplos con el caso Sindoni y el caso de los hermanos Faddoul. Los actores son buenos, pero no excelentes, y a veces caen en la exageraci\u00f3n del palabrerio, pero cumplen la funci\u00f3n principal, que es la de demostrar roles de la sociedad venezolana, que son impalpables para quienes viven fuera de los barrios m\u00e1s peligrosos de Caracas. La historia no me sorprende, de hecho es muy predecible, aburrida y poco imaginativa; porque los secuestrados caen una y otra vez en momentos de angust\u00eda y desesperaci\u00f3n, que solo una persona maldita con la mala suerte puede conseguir. La historia pudo haber sido mucho mejor."

      "text": "It would be easy just to summarize this enjoyable sequel to Blue Sky's CGI-animated blockbuster as the ultimate \"if you liked Numero Uno, ditto with Numero Dos\" movie, but some special congratulations are in order. After Blue Sky scored with the original, they made the disastrous mistake of trying to top themselves in all the wrong ways, and as a result we got Robots, a visually outlandish but criminally underwritten (and thoroughly unattractive and unappealing) farrago crammed with witless, desperate pop-culture one-liners and gratuitous but completely indistinctive celebrity voice casting. Praise the heavens that the writers, animators, designers (and let's be honest about it, the bean counters too) at Blue Sky at least temporarily renounced the errors of their ways and returned to what served them so well in the original Ice Age: restrained but effective visuals, solid scripting, plotting and gagwriting, distinctive and appealing characterizations, and vocal choices made with almost laser- (or Pixar-) like precision. Many adults (and pretty much ALL kids) know the drill by now: irascible saber-toother tiger Diego, morose mammoth Manny, and friendly but irritating sloth Sid make a trek from Point A to Point B, fighting the elements, various other creatures, and sometimes each other, along the way; it's simple, but it works. Denis Leary is a tad underused this time as Diego, but John Leguizamo's natural a-little-bit-of-him-goes-a-long-way qualities are perfect for Sid, and Ray Romano makes the widowed Manny wonderfully Eeyore-like. An added romantic element is effortlessly inserted as Manny attempts to kindle an on-again, off-again romance with lady mammoth Ellie (a typically witty and charismatic Queen Latifah) that's constantly roadblocked by his memories of the past and her utter conviction that she's a possum. (For the second time in a row in an Ice Age movie, we get some Traumatic Mammoth Flashback Footage that provides backstory, but if your little one couldn't take Dumbo's heartbreaking seperation from his mom, best take him or her out for an obligatory bathroom break.) It's a real compliment to Romano, Latifah and their writers that this subplot manages to contain more urgency and rooting interest than is evident in 90% of the live-action romcoms released in the last 5 years. All this, and a delicious back-comic musical sequence performed by vultures, too! And no, I haven't forgotten Scrat, the scruffy little squirrel-rat whose perpetually twitchy demeanor suggests that of a 70-year-old man who's lived right next to the airport for most of his life. There's a lot more of him and his agonizing, Sisyphean struggle to get and keep his beloved acorn this time around, here reaching epic and even theological proportions. If the noticeably increased Scrat sequences are the result of market research inquiries indicating that audiences wanted to see more of him, then here's a rare case of pollsters actually IMPROVING a movie rather than the reverse. Many comparisons have been made between Scrat and Wile E. Coyote, but while Wile E. pretty much just wants to eat the Road Runner, Scrat is even more acutely sympathetic because in the few, frustratingly fleeting moments when he gets to hold on to the acorn (which is almost a seperate character in and of itself), his facial expression, body language and sounds demonstrate more genuine love and tenderness toward the object of his devotion than I've seen some mothers show toward their babies! Some years ago the General Mills cereal company asked the TV-viewing public to vote on whether the similarly thwarted Trix Rabbit should finally be allowed to eat a bowl of his favorite sugary breakfast treat; the vote was \"yes\" by an overwhelming majority. If Blue Sky ever decides to conduct a similar survey involving Scrat and his acorn, mark me down in advance as the first yea vote. Lord knows, the poor little guy has certainly earned it!"

Ice Age 2 is one of those rarities. you know the ones that i'm talking about. the sequels that are almost, if not just as good as the original. yes, believe it or not, Ice Age 2 was almost as good as its predecessor. the humor balanced between child-friendly and keeping the older age groups entertained quite nicely, and thankfully there weren't too many re-used jokes, as seems to be the recent trend with comedy sequels these days. the two alligator-things that appeared periodically throughout the movie were kinda pointless, and really just felt like filler to keep the action moving. perhaps the best part about the movie were the scrat sequences. simply hilarious. Ellie, Crash, and Eddie were nice additions to the cast, but sometimes became a little annoying. overall, 8.5 out of 10."
