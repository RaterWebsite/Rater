      "text": "This one surprised me but \"Eli\" is definitely one of the stronger Netflix horror movies.The first half seemed to have a slower pace compared to the second half. However, the story itself was fascinating and kept me guessing up until the last scene. Acting was overall solid minus a few moments with the kid actor. Music and atmosphere were also solid. Some of the jump scares were predictable if you've seen enough horror movies, but the interesting story makes up for that.Overall, I would recommend \"Eli\" to those looking for a nice Netflix horror movie."

      "text": "This film is very original work that has a rich and deep story and a mix of other horror films.When I watched it I see a good mix of atmosphere of next films: The Others (2001), A Cure for Wellness (2017),  Carrie (2013). Also, if you know this film or like as other work - you could think about many ends of story, but the true final of picture is beautiful, impressive and mind-blowing."

      "rating": "3",
      "text": "For the first half it's a copy/paste of the same \"scary\" scene over and over again mixed with a heap of ridiculous non-answers from all characters at all times, probably to extend the length of the damn thing. It's completely stripped of any kind of human emotion or logic reactions from everyone included. It's quite simply put a complete disaster of a movie. When it nears its end it tries to throw some lame plot twists at you that \"clears everything up\". But the plot twists themselves are so laughably out there that it only accomplishes to take it to a whole new level of utter nonsense."

      "text": "Nicely filmed, pacing is steady and performances are serviceable.  Lilli Taylor always carries her weight.  i found the scares very effective, not generic jump scares, very well done blending of light and shadow and characters.  I like the dad doing tough love, too often characters could be more real if they attempted a balancing act like real people.  It was like a good pulpy horror book from the 1970s."

      "text": "In just a week Netflix released two films with the same premise of: Nothing is what it seems. Although with different narrative approaches, I speak of Fractured and now Eli.The problem is that both have ridiculous plot twist and both are unable to create suspense.Eli is more inclined towards horror but my God the atmosphere is so damn passive that after about 40 minutes you will be begging for something more interesting to happen. And it doesn't.Everything is too messy and scattered and the final minutes are very similar to many other exorcism films and the ending above all feels empty and devoid of a real crucial or stronger moment.Calling it disappointing is me being nice."

      "text": "Despite this film's few inconsistencies, the powerful performances (particularly by the young man who portrayed Eli), easily voided some of the flaws. Although Eli did lack in originality, SOMEHOW it managed to keep me interested throughout. I've always rather enjoyed Lili Taylor's work. Nothing earth shattering, but I liked it."
