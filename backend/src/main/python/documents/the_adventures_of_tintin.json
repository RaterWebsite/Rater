(No hating on that movie, it was \"good enough\") It was mindblowing to watch this here movie, the amount of awesome camera angles, funny writing and awesome motion in this movie is just wonderful, it made my day... no take that back, it made my week! My friends are going to hate me, because the only subject my mouth will talk about is how awesome and fine adjusted this here movie is, the countless of funny spoofs so professionally performed by the one and only Spielberg... What do you honestly expect from a movie like this? Get ready to get your mind blown by this here superb movie i give a round number 9. It is a great story made into an awesome movie, maybe the only problem with it is Tintin acting a bit too cliche and dramatic at some points (I could count 2.) But that's my only concern.. and it's THAT minor... like almost nothing, GREAT MOVIE i love it!"

I was expecting the 3D motion capture computer-animation to be much more lifelike, much like how Avatar when it was released. Instead this movie felt too 'cartoony' for my taste buds despite the fact that the content is marketed to the late teen/early adult demographic."

Personally, I like a movie that gives me something to take back into my life with me.  Tin Tin left me with very little.Comparing this to another movie in its class, Toy Story is far and away better.  You CAN make animated characters (more) believable and have a plot that works better, and actually leaves people at the end feeling like they are just a little bit better than when they walked in."

Animations of Tintin were made, 30 minute long stories I think, that followed Herg\u00e9's works exactly, and these were fantastic! I think Tintin is simply not meant to be made into full-length feature films of 2 hours. Mixing the characters and plots of Herg\u00e9's Tintin stories AND adding in new \"Hollywoodized\" content (the crane fight and the bazooka, etc...), was an awful decision.\r It was fantastic watching the first 15 minutes of the Secret of the Unicorn, haha, and then we suddenly switch to the Crab with the Golden Claws, but mix the characters and plots from the two. What a mess. The visuals are fun to watch, the computer rendering that is, but the story and what they have done with Herg\u00e9's work is a mess!\r I wonder how the Asterix \"real people\" films worked out. The Asterix stories are similar in length to Tintin I think. I wonder what the French did with Asterix?!"

Adapted from the graphic novels by Herge, this adaptation of Tintin is remarkably true to the source material. While I am not sure that a hyper-realistic motion capture animation style fit the world of Tintin, the performances are quite good. The script at times is clunky and dated, but thrilling action sequences make it easy to overlook. Fun for the whole family, give Tintin a watch if you want to know where Spielberg got the inspiration for Indiana Jones."

In my previous experience its so distracting I can't see past it but this time I actually forgot it was motion capture. Thinking back on it I realize just how awkward the facial expressions stuck me, especially Captain Haddock. Its a better than average kids flick with enough for the adults to enjoy as well. I was surprised when Tintin brandished a Walther PPK. My first thought was \"oh, I thought this was a kids movie\". I'm glad political correctness hasn't completely eaten the brain of movie makers."

This \"Indiana Jones-esque\" film is fast paced and filled with very witty dialogue, charming characters and a clear yet compelling story. It is visually stunning; much effort was evidently placed on the animation and detailed sound design; the editing and 'cinematography' also gave it a very cinematic look (kudos to that single shot chase scene) and John Williams gives another exceptional score. Despite these positives, the movie is quite exhausting: there was non-stop action-adventure with very little time for air. Yes, that's right, Tintin could have done very well with more development, to fully flesh out the characters and add more weight and depth to the solid story. The narration needed more patience, but, the movie was way too much fun to let this get in the way too much."

Spielberg's attempt at Motion Capture technology looks fantastic, with great art direction and lighting with scenes that almost look perfect. The script is designed to inspire children to wanting to learn, explore and become smart kids. It's a literate, clever and high brow family film that really could have reached more greater heights. The trouble is in the three central characters - TinTin, Snowy the Dog(who was my favorite) and the weakest of the bunch - A Drunk Sea Captain who struggles under the lineage of a damned Sir Francis Drake. I didn't connect with the human characters in the film. Neither the narrative or the characters match the scenery and fun that a movie like this should have. This could have been much better."

The action scenes dazzle, be it Tintin and his buddy Haddock tearing up a middle eastern town or trying to escape off a boat, they are all pretty amazing and beautifully crafted. The voice acting is amazing, especially Captain Haddock, Haddock can be hilarious and serious when needed to be and the character contributes to a lighter tone of the movie. The plot is relatively thrilling too as Tintin must find the treasure of the Unicorn while he faces opposition along the way but the plot is kinda thin though and the characters do not have an awful lot of depth to them. The characters are pretty amazing but a bit more depth into the characters could be appreciated but these complaints are washed away when you become bedazzled by the action sequences, they are amazing. Overall, Tintin is a great action packed film with cutting edge animation and lots of humor, the plot and characters could have used a bit more development but that is not what will be talked about when people mention Tintin. Tintin is an eye-popping thrill ride that will keep you hooked from start to finish and have you begging for more, it's awesome.

The film is fast paced adventure that never slows down even for a second. Each frame is beauitifly rendered by weta digital and the each frame seems teeming with detail. It really does put a good foundation for what see as what could be a great franchise.  I just made it out of the midnight showing and it seemed that everyone in the theater enjoyed it. However, the theater contained only about six or seven people, which is a sad showing for an opening night midnight release.

Spielberg is channeling his \"Indiana Jones\" phase, with the same type of chase scenes he used in those films.  Remember the scene in the second Indiana Jones film where they are kicking around a bottle on the dance floor?  He uses the same formula here with pieces of a clue only it goes on a little too long.  The 3D animation looks great, the pace is good.  I would have preferred more humor and less action but still enjoyed it.  Spielberg has even hired John Williams to do the soundtrack and you will hear similarities to Indiana Jones during some of the chase scenes.  Overall a good effort and the ending sets up a sequel which I will look forward to."

Here is a super hard to make, beautiful looking movie with a screenplay that wasn't 100%.  \"that's okay, things will pick up once Tintin hits the road\" i thought.  But not really.  the jokes continued to be hit or miss (not funny enough for adults, and possibly out of grasp for children due to all the alcohol references).  And that ambiguous demographic tone sums up the whole movie for me in the end.  Too much for kids, and too shallow for adults.  Not to mention the second half of the movie really drags.  Overall, the movie isn't a complete waste of time and i would probably see the sequel if it got favorable word of mouth.

There have been successful kids animated movies but nothing that has worked in using blended animation. The lack of facial expression has been challenging. This movie gets very close to the potential, and things will only get better from here. Submersing actors in computer animated worlds can only get so far. Tin Tin accomplishes the visualization aspects in the potential of \"actorless\" action movie making.  All we need now is the addition of cohesive plot writing from creative adult perspectives.
