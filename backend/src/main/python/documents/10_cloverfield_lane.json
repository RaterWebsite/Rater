      "text": "When J.J. Abrams released Cloverfield in 2008, it arrived cloaked in secrecy. Now, some eight years later, the film\u2019s so-called \u201cblood relative\u201d (Abrams\u2019 term, not mine), comes with a similar marketing strategy. Going-in, viewers are unlikely to be certain what to expect and, emerging, they might not be quite sure exactly what they witnessed.  The problems with 10 Cloverfield Lane result from attempts to tie it, however tenuously, to the earlier movie. Take away the disappointing, disjointed, and anti-climactic final act, and this is an effective white-knuckle psychological thriller. And, although the final 15 minutes don\u2019t ruin the movie, they detract from its better parts.\r The premise is simple: following a car accident, Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) awakens to find herself chained to a wall in what appears to be a basement. She soon learns that she has been brought to this place by the hulking, rather scary Howard (John Goodman), for her \u201cown good.\u201d The basement is actually a doomsday bunker with three occupants: survivalist Howard; his former handyman, Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.); and Michelle, whom Howard rescued from her smashed car. In the outside world, all is not well. According to Howard, apocalyptic events have occurred. His plan is for the three of them to shelter in place and wait it out until things are safe. Michelle thinks he\u2019s crazy. Emmett isn\u2019t so certain.\r By using double-bluffs and red herrings, director Dan Trachtenberg crafts a claustrophobic psychological thriller that hums along nicely. Hitchcockian misdirection abounds. From moment-to-moment we\u2019re never quite sure who (or what) Howard really is: a lonely savior whose paranoia has been validated or a creepy kidnapper acting out a twisted delusion? Is the situation outside the bunker real or a figment of Howard\u2019s warped mind? Did \u201cthe Ruskies\u201d attack? Or aliens? Or nothing at all? Perhaps Howard faked the mutilations of some pigs to \u201cprove\u201d that the air isn\u2019t safe? So many questions\u2026 At times, 10 Cloverfield Lane has a similar vibe as the TV series Lost which, not coincidentally, was produced by Abrams\u2019 Bad Robot Productions.\r While keeping us guessing, 10 Cloverfield Lane provides several nail-biting scenes. Sound is an important part of how the tension is amplified - every noise is loud and the insistent musical score throbs. 10 Cloverfield Lane doesn\u2019t employ \u201cfound footage\u201d like the original Cloverfield. Camera movement is smooth and clean and the shots are composed to emphasize how cramped and uncomfortable the limited space is. The movie is presented from Michelle\u2019s perspective and its tone varies with her mood. Her opinion of Howard and the situation changes frequently and the film reflects that. There\u2019s even a goofy musical montage that shows the three companions playing board games and putting together puzzles like any \u201cnormal\u201d family.\r Winstead is a good choice to play the heroine because she\u2019s strong yet feminine. (She previously appeared as Bruce Willis\u2019 daughter in the fourth Die Hard film and as the lead in the prequel to John Carptenter\u2019s The Thing.) John Goodman is a perfect Howard - Goodman has the rare talent of being able to play both a cuddly, likeable guy and a frighteningly dangerous one. In 10 Cloverfield Lane, he\u2019s asked to do both.\r The film\u2019s failing is that, in linking it to Cloverfield, it abandons the elements that made the majority of the movie effective. The final fifteen minutes don\u2019t work as a way to wrap up this story or as an introduction to a larger (generic) canvas. They feel tacked-on and rushed. Nevertheless, as weak as the conclusion may be, it doesn\u2019t obfuscate the good things to precede it. 10 Cloverfield Lane is packed with suspense and tension and offers some of the best bait-and-switch work of any recent psychological thriller. It\u2019s easy to forgive any missteps toward the end when considering the entire package."

      "text": "The biggest problem in Cloverfield (2008), was the previous part of the actual stuff and how that affected the whole movie after that, in here, yes, there is a explanation of what is going on in the character's life, and it does work, because it is fast and works to let you know the character just fine so as it is crucial for the story to happens, so it isn't for free or anything bad, it is a great way to introduce in here. The story overall it is really fine, they first try to give us a mystery, for those that already know the Cloverfield franchise that mystery won't work, because these people will already know what is true or not about what is going on outside, but for those that are going to watch it without knowing what the series is about, i think that it will be really nice to figure things and never be sure of the outside world, just like the characters.\u00a0 Wich lead us to say that the characters would be extremely important to work, there are only three characters to interact and they had to be really good and different, and that is exactly\u00a0what it is, each character have his function for the narrative and all work, you truly care about what is going on. The sequence of facts feels really natural and well done, you first got a mystery from the character, Michelle, perspective, wich works, than you got slowly introduced to the situation by Howard's words, and then got to know the whole bunker and it's rules in a way that you understand very well without getting any boring. The character of Emmett does give a nice personality contrast to work with Howard and for Michelle, the chemistry works fine. During the course of the story there are some really good plot twists, while it goes it does give some more layers to the characters and things got way more scarier and definely got my attention more and more, you got to know the characters more deep and caring more and more for them. There are a few moments where things felt, not just rushed, but the characters could have said something better, like invent things and use creativity, like it was already shown that they had creativity, doing something smart instead of just tearing things apart that easy. There some dialogues where things feels a little unnatural.More at the end there are a big tone difference compared to the whole movie, i do think that in some moments at the ending things went well and in others it got lost, there are somethings that felt just to easy or didn't really made me buy, but in overall the ending worked for me. I read another person saying about a metaphor in this story, and i found it really interesting, so i'm gonna put it in here.\u00a0 So it will have some SPOILERS in this paragraph. It consists in facing the unknown, getting out of the comfort zone. The person said that the characters would represent characteristics from the character Michelle, Emmett would represent hesitation and fear, Howard accommodation and safety. The movie talks much about umconfortable/safety for being in a bunker. All the attempts to leave the bunker are frustrade by Howard. And only when Emmett, the hesitation, dies, the protagonist can overcome Howard and leave the bunker to face aliens, wich would represent the unkown itself. So it would be like she overcame the hesitation, get away of the sense of safety in the comfort zone for literally confront the unkown. The last scene would reinforce this, when she hear in the radio that a city is already under control and Houston are still in war and in need for help, and then she chooses Houston to go.\u00a0 END OF SPOILERS. The technique aspects in here are very good, it can give different senses for who is watching, a claustrophobic moment or a discovering with open plans. The camera movimentation and closing up are really good. The sound design are also nice, hearing things depending from where they are was really important, the mis-en-scene was good, you could have a good idea of how it would feel to be inside of that bunker. The design of the whole place is really nice, you can get where is where or where they are going, it is fluid. The soundtrack is really good, we do hear a lot of songs in this movie as well, and they really worked fine, it helped on giving the scenes some structure. The acting works really fine. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is great, she gave many aspects in here, trying to be conviction, being extremely nervous but holding it down, she really convinces me in everything she did, very good performance. John Goodman is also very fine in this film, he first give a calm character that is trying to do the right thing, but you can clearly see that he is unstable, that he could do anything in any moment and that gives some thriller to the movie. John Gallagher Jr. have a more trickster and joking kind of way, his character isn' much challenging but he did fine."

      "text": "Incredibly tense and well-paced with sudden bursts of comedy to relieve the tension, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a wonderfully dark look at a life spent entrapped and its toll on the human psyche, without preaching or talking down on its viewers. It's incredibly suspenseful, with enough payoff at the ending to keep you satisfied with the build up. John Goodman, as always, steals every scene he is a part of, using phenomenally creepy yet endearing versions of his character one after the other.\r My only complaint, and I understand why they did this, is that the ending felt a bit like a big-budget ending that didn't fit the rest of the film. Yes, the payoff is good and unexpected (at least for me), it drags on a bit out of its own bunker and dips its feet in the water of a big-budget action sci-fi film. I see why they did this; it leaves the opportunity for sequels of greater name value or production value. And there's not necessarily anything wrong with that concept, it's just that it didn't fit the rest of the film thematically.\r Having said that, 10 Cloverfield Lane is one of the most suspenseful movies I've seen in recent years, keeping shots tight and balanced with great performances from all three of the main characters."

      "text": "\"Produced by JJ Abrams\" is generally all it takes to get my ass in a theater seat these days and I rushed in to see 10 Cloverfield Lane as quick as I could and I was not disappointed. We all know that this film really came out of nowhere a couple months ago when the film was revealed only 2 months before it came out.\r Some people may find this film to be slow but I felt that it went by so fast. This film is 103 minutes and when it was over it felt like 50 minutes had past. Key men behind the first film returned as producers in Abrams, Drew Goddard and the director of the first film Matt Reeves. Rookie filmmaker Dan Trachtenberg deserves a pat on the back after a great debut and I'm sure we will be hearing that name again on some more big productions. The cast was so great! John Goodman is outstanding. I honestly feel like there is no one who could have pulled off the role of Howard the way he did. Its nice to see him in a mainstream film because he is such a talented guy and we don't seem to see as much of him anymore. Goodman's character is so mysterious and you really never know whether he's a good guy or a bad guy. I think that Mary Elizabeth Winstead did not reach Goodman's level but she was very good as well and is probably the best I have seen from her so far in her career. Then you have John Gallagher Jr. who was strong and likeable as well.\r Most of this movie has a very independent feel through the first 2 acts and I was very fine with that and the first two acts are the high points of the film. With JJ involved it definitely feels similar to the \"Hatch\" in Lost which I love. There are so many tense moments where you are so engaged and I found myself attached to Winstead's character Michelle. You are really rooting for her the whole way through.\r The third act took me out of the story just slightly when the monsters finally show up because it is just such a shift into a whole different type of danger. I still thought the monsters looked good and they were pretty scary while they were around. I recommend that this film be viewed in the theater just so you can get the experience of seeing the monsters on the big screen.\r I was fine with the ending too, which was obviously a huge cliff hanger and as long as we get another movie I'm 100% fine with it. I would not rule out the fact that we are seeing another Cloverfield film that starts up right where the last one left off. I was not be shocked by an announcement of another movie before the end of 2016. I'll have my fingers crossed."

Goodman takes the film above and beyond what it maybe should have been, delivering the well-written mix of nervous tension and entertaining comic relief. Nearly every moment, start to finish, is directly moving the story along while keeping the audience guessing at every turn. What I take away from the film in a negative light is that the climax cuts off a well-crafted tension that felt as if it had just gotten rolling. This is also, obviously, a huge respect for the craft. But perhaps the worst thing about this film is its title. Had the title been different and the relation to Abrams's former project of the same name been alluded, the film would have been much more rewarding in the end. I mean, this outing is an entirely different beast than its \"blood relative.\" Connecting the relation before seeing the new outing only hinders the well-built mystery. I feel like Abrams should've thought that through. However, as it stands, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a highly entertaining thriller that crawls its way deep beneath the skin.

In 10 Cloverfield Lane, a woman, Michelle, gets in a car accident and wakes up in an underground bunker. Her captor, Howard claims to have saved her life and that everyone outside the bunker is dead. Another man is also in the bunker, named Emmet, and tensions arise between the three as Howard becomes increasingly suspicious, and Emmet and Michelle mount an escape plan. While Cloverfield, was an intense, in-your-face monster flick, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a completely different beast altogether. Instead of the vast area of New York City, this movie takes place in the confines of a doomsday bunker, so the scares come from paranoia and suspense than a giant monster attacking the city. All three cast members are excellent in their roles, especially John Goodman as Howard. His awesomely creepy performance makes this one of his most memorable roles. Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Galleger Jr. are incredible as well. You may recognize her as Wendy from Final Destination 3. Winstead's character definitely isn't a damsel in destress here; Michelle is crafty and smart like Nancy from A Nightmare on Elm Street. John Galleger Jr. also provides some witty comic relief while also seeming a bit suspicious himself. 10 Cloverfield Lane is a restrained, suspenseful and well-crafted psychological thriller that calls to mind both Misery and The Twilight Zone, and if this anthology series continues, it'll be hard to match the standards set by this and its predecessor."

      "text": "10 Cloverfield Lane is a very well-crafted and intense film, elevated by a fantastic performance from John Goodman. A mix of thriller, sci-fi, horror, and drama, 10 Cloverfield Lane also works in some moments of comedy to lighten an incredibly bleak mood. Director Dan Trachtenberg does a great job here creating tension and letting it build to a very good pay-off. As mentioned, Goodman is phenomenal with an intense and entirely gripping performance that plays very well into the air of mystery the film possesses. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is great here and John Gallagher Jr was also quite good. The film is a very compelling and thought-provoking one, lending itself greatly to further study as to character motivations and what all is really going on throughout the film. Some have criticized the ending, but I really am a fan. I thought it was a thrilling end to a thrilling film. Overall, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a very good film that has some filler and is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but it still a good thriller that really gets the gears in the brain turning."

Expect a claustrophobic thriller packed with a commentary on risk, chance, consequence and conspiracy as well as a smooth, exciting blend with the first. Totally worth your time."

      "text": "10 Cloverfield Lane is barely a sequel to the original Cloverfield story-- and that's what makes it so great. It finds an original story to tell, taking place (with the exception of a couple scenes) in an underground bunker. The acting, screenplay, and effects are all above average, and the movie finds exciting ways to tell the story, including an ambiguous ending, opening up the door for more sequels. It will probably go down as one of the best sci-fi movies of 2016."

There isnt any shaky cam for the most part, and the acting is absolutely fantastic, especially from John Goodman. He plays the part of the average Redditor who has planned for the end of the world for the majority of his life. There was not a single moment in the entire film (Other than the abismal ending) that i was not glued to the screen. I was however a little disappointing that the bunker was not further underground. The poster made it seem like the thing was kilometers below the surface, but when i think of it that would have been overkill.\r Over all i rate this film a 7/10. I take one point off for the missing jigsaw piece, one point off for not being able to see them complete the game of monopoly over the 3 years they were down there, and one point off for the alien vagina spaceship that combusted on contact with whiskey. Also i add one point for just being so much better than all the other crap that has come out recently. So actually its an 8/10."

      "text": "Tenuously connected to 2008\u2019s \u2018Cloverfield\u2019 but very much its own film, this is a superbly acted thriller which is edge of the seat stuff. A lot of the drama takes place in a bunker that is sheltering three people from an unknown outside terror which, according to the viewpoint of one of the three- Michelle, may not exist. The actors are great and the claustrophobic feel in the bunker is well utilised enabling the suspense and tension to build effectively. In fact, so good are the scenes within the bunker at questioning the motives of John Goodman's character that one almost forgets to consider whether the terror they are hiding from is real or not. Only when the action moves outside does one immediately guess what the truth of the situation is. The score and the terrific sound effectively jangle the nerves throughout contributing to a very impressive feature film debut by director Dan Trachtenberg. The ending leaves some room for a sequel which, in the event, could be as different from this film as this one is from \u2018Cloverfield\u2019."

      "text": "Wow! What can I say other than this movie completely exceeded even the highest of my expectations! Being such a huge fan of 2008's Cloverfield, I was certainly intrigued and looking forward to seeing just how much this film would expand upon that film in terms of the storyline or the monster. However, what I got from this film was definitely much more than I expected to get, and in a good way! The story, setting, atmosphere, etc was all so tense and mysterious from start to finish! Even the small, yet highly effective cast kept things plenty entertaining and interesting. Mary Elizabeth WInstead and John Gallagher Jr. both give solid performances, but holy hell brace yourself for John Goodman, who delivers such a menacing and chilling as hell performance, and undoubtedly his most memorable one in a long time! As for the story and its connection to Cloverfield, without giving anything away, the final twenty minutes or so should be enough to satisfy those who were dying to know if it ties in with that film in any way, but it's also effective in the sense that it can make the film stand out on its own really well too. Overall, this not only satisfied my cravings for more Cloverfield, but it also provided  unexpectedly tense and suspenseful entertainment from start to finish!"

      "text": "Shot with a pleasant paradigm shift from the found-footage style that 'Cloverfield' so famously helped popularise, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a powerful but wonderfully strange air-tight narrative about looking life in the face. Its transition from a suspense thriller to a balls to the wall science fiction film shows its subversiveness - and flaunts itself proudly as an experiment - something that so many sequels (spiritual or chronological) dare not do."
