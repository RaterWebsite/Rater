They are hiding from people because he seems not to be able to live among them. He tries his best to provide for his daughter teaching her survival skills, homeschooling her, etc. They are very close, there is no need for lengthy dialogs. His daughter's mom is not in the picture, the girl practically does not remember her. She is all he's got in this life yet at some point the girl insists that she wants to live among people.There are no villains in this movie, no violence; people do what they think they should.

Her mother had died when Tom was young and her father suffers PTSD and we follow what happens when they are \u2018discovered\u2019 and brought into the world of community. There is a strong love between daughter and father and though she finds sharing life with others is giving something a growing teenager needs she does not want to be separated from her Dad.Tom is way ahead scholastically due to the teaching by her father but meeting bunnies, dogs even bees along with discovering what the 4H is, learning how to ride a bike and meets a friendly boy, giving her a taste what she may have missed not knowing she was missing it.There is no high drama regarding Will\u2019s illness, no question if the two are homeless or just not living as most people do, just a quiet look at how people can take your heart and, sometimes, that is not enough.\u201cLeave No Trace\u201d is a linear story that, in a sense, has an open ending but you have come to know these two people to the point that you almost know what will happen to them in the future\u2014with some doubt.Though it may not be a \u2018must see\u2019 it certainly is a way to escape the South Florida heat and humidity for an hour and fifty minutes and watching Thomasin Harcourt McKenzie give a star making turn is certainly worth your time."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "While it feels a little \"been there, done that\" and doesn't really bring anything new to the table due to some recent similar films about living in/surviving in the wilderness or being on the run (i.e. 'Captain Fantastic' and 'The Glass Castle'), this turned out to be a simple yet highly effective and thoughtful look at the bond of a father and daughter trying to simply make their way in the world. Been Foster and Thomasin McKenzie are so endearing together and really seem to form a genuine connection in every scene they share together. Like their traveling characters in the film however, the story felt rather all over the place at times and the ending was a slight letdown for me, but overall, Foster and McKenzie's onscreen chemistry and performances are the beating heart of this often rather touching film with lots of realistic and poignant themes to boot."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "An intriguing if sometimes somewhat meandering tale about living off the grid, dealing with adaptation to society's expectations and reconciling our feelings about our past.

Based on Peter Rock's novel ''My Abandonment'' which is inspired by the true story of a veteran and his 12-year-old daughter who were discovered living in a Portland's Forest Park.The way in which the film begins if you didn't know what you were dealing with, you might believe that it's a story located in a post-apocalyptic world, but that's simply not the case. Will (Ben Foster) is an Army veteran who suffers from PTSD and has exiled himself to live in isolation in a national park with his teenage daughter Tom (Thomasin McKenzie).The film gives us few clues but they're enough to understand the background of Will's character and in that way to better understand his relationship with Tom, which eventually begins to build the perspective between both of them. Especially Tom's perspective, which sets the foundation of the whole story and what eventually leads to its ending when they must take separate paths. Him for not being able to recover and wants to continue living isolated, while Tom decides that she cannot go with him again and needs to try to have a normal life.Leave No Trace is certainly emotional but as I said, the approach is discreet, it's a sober and concise story. Its strengths are its protagonists and both Ben Foster and Thomasin McKenzie do an excellent job.Although director Debra Manik had already directed a documentary in 2014, this film feels like a natural progression for what she did in ''Winter's Bone''.Leave No Trace is not a grandiloquent or striking film but if you are looking for an intimate and fairly well made film, it's an excellent option."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Leave No Trace is a film inspired by the book My Abandonment written by Peter Rock. Obviously, there are many discrepancies between films inspired by the stories in books and the actual stories in the books. As much as the story and film differ, I find Leave No Trace radically adjusts the narrative to direct and instruct more so than fulfill the telling of the story written by Peter Rock. My Abandonment feels like more of a therapeutic process similar to Helen MacDonald\u2019s H is for Hawk which carries a poetic resonance of Annie Dillard\u2019s Holy the Firm though is less agonizing and grueling than the latter two mentioned.Leave No Trace utilizes the \u201cThe Principles of Leave No Trace\u201d in action to fulfill a core element of the story branching from My Abandonment which concerns leaving as is and letting go. There is a full redemption in the film and a freeing relinquishing that does not exist in My Abandonment. There are more than a few concepts at play in Leave No Trace\u200a\u2014\u200asome more apparent than others\u200a\u2014\u200athat must be addressed in accordance with the text of its inspiration.There are very awkward still moments in the film that indicate an awkward attachment between the father and daughter which makes more sense in connection with the book focusing on Caroline\u2019s (Tom/Yellow in the film) relationship with her father. Adoptive families and families from which adoptees come from are important topics which find a spin throughout the film which makes Will (Tom/Yellow\u2019s father in the film) look more like a person assisting with and disrupting home placement at the same time (which ends up making the film more about a father-daughter relationship than a film about adoption processes).Will becomes a more understanding parent by action as the film progresses and stands as a guiding force which gives Tom/Yellow the tools necessary to break away into her own. Tom/Yellow begins delineating the circumstances of which she wants to live with which is very important in viewing. Tom and Will spend a lot of time staring at each other conversing: both of them seem to be slowly separating especially as Tom begins to find that living with her father\u2019s way of life is not most suitable to her liking. Leave No Trace makes choice very available for women\u200a\u2014\u200agrowing women in particular\u200a\u2014\u200athat struggle breaking away from their fatherly nurturing to discover a broader world of choices available to them. In the film, Tom/Yellow is a woman of sensible grounding that has undergone proper training from her father on ways to survive and is capable of assessing social situations about her well enough to progress without suffering overwhelmingly due to her upbringing though she does go through slight troubles poetically shown through her interactions with her father in the film.The other aspect is that lives are different regardless of the family from which one comes. There might be a familial purpose to assist growth\u200a\u2014\u200abut, that will never be able to undermine an individual\u2019s need\u200a\u2014\u200aeven want\u200a\u2014\u200ato develop their life, within their own life, of their own circumstances. The film shows a great understanding from Tom/Yellow which results in a peaceable separation between Will and Tom. The book, My Abandonment, showcases a much rougher separation between Caroline (Tom/Yellow) and her father. Also, the effects of the daughter-father relationship extremely affect Caroline\u2019s developments as an individual breaking into a more public-social realm: the daughter\u2019s reality is completely twisted because of her relationship with her father and prevents her from even accepting the assistance of non-judgmental women willing to help her.Both the film and the book create an accepting and overcoming on the daughter\u2019s part of the father\u2019s circumstances as well as of developing familial circumstances as the daughter in both the book and the film progress on their own with their available mind and skill sets. I understand the importance of parenting in one\u2019s life\u200a\u2014\u200amore so than parenting\u200a\u2014\u200aguidance. People need guidance depending on their experiential, knowledge, and understanding levels which varies from person to person. I like the patience shown in the film which indicates a slow process might be necessary and best moving forward in one\u2019s life where as in the text the daughter continues on her path though eventually finds her own pacing within the pacing she has come to learn from her father. There are a lot of good relationships that are available and to be had that should not find disruption due to one\u2019s behavioral habits and understandings that may be detrimental to personal growths. A mind capable of truly developing and understanding does not suffer from having to experience familiarity and is capable of a flexibility which allows for the creation of life without bounds across many, if not all, mediums of existence. Overall: B+/A-IG: @Dufreshest"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Next to The Rider, it's probably the movie of the year. Ben Foster's performance is subtle and brilliant, but he is topped by the actress who plays his daughter. She's pitch perfect.  It's an interesting spotlight on the margins of society.  Also interesting that the government separated parents from children in a non-border, non-incarceration context. I suppose it's necessary for well-meaning government agencies to assess the fitness of parents in these situations.  Regardless, I love how the film highlights the generosity of regular folks (the truck driver, the trailer-park lady, the ex-army medic) who look out for others strictly because they are human beings - and not because there's something in it for them. Foster plays the vet role with extreme dignity, and he's never over-the-top.  Easy recommendation for anyone."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This movie gripped me in ways that I totally did not expect.

But she is still a kid. I'm just not sure about these movies that are completely reliant on self possessed, motherless girls. I had the same reaction to the book, Secret Life of Bees. And bees are featured in this movie as some kind of metaphor for life. The story was way too idealized. Motherless girls are not self possessed. They grow up in many was dissociated from their own feelings. The film was beautifully made. I just wish the story had more realism to the inner life of the girl.

The finite number of characters, the finite amount of segments and its that repetitiveness that weaves out a poem that requires spatial of a larger margin, hence what she does in here is, tugs out all the mechanics for it to float freely without any strings tied. This father and daughter exploration is cathartic to the core and communicates neatly, not for its positive emotions but the negative, that it doesn't flinch to project. Since, if Foster has all the tactics to survive that he teaches to Mackenzie, he also has plethora of emotional burden of his forsaken and untouched past and that is not something which is supposed to be passed upon. It tells an honest tale of Foster and Mackenzie and their journey across the woods where the zeal to live by nature, costs each other unfeasible terms. No matter how artificial it gets at times, the touch of nature is imputed in each frame. And Granik does it by keeping both her lead character together even when they are separated; either their notions can be filtered out or their vocab. The characters in here doesn't need the element of surprise to scare, its their looks, their habits, their stillness, that leaves us shook. The primary reason why we are afraid of these simple characters, is because we start to care for them; if someone gets wounded, he or she will be taken care of with a first aid kit. There is very little skin in the telltale, it wants you to scrape off and feel the blood and sweat of the game; these chess pieces are real. Foster hesitates to look Mackenzie in the eye while she gazes deep into his, this is a performance of life for both of the actors screaming through the entire feature. If those buzzing of the bees weren't loud enough for you, listen to it again, Granik has a story to tell you. She is not here to convince you to look closely and listen carefully, she demands it with her apt finesse on executing such a behemoth concept. Mackenzie's character is bred out of raw woods, hence her nature is to reside and breathe in the current moment, she is ready to take what's hers if be needed, she will earn for it and she will take it. On the other hand, Foster is chiseled with experience and lives in the past, which allows him to spend the entire breathe of his on preparing the trajectory of the future. Combining these two, the makers leave them around greenery (it is beautifully shot and has supremely appealing bright colors that grabs your attention since the beginning) and observes the retaliation that their chemistry spreads. This is a work of nothing but sheer passion that ought to fuel such a fragile concept and Leave No Trace will leave no opportunity whatsoever to heal your wounds."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "-\"Everything's different now.\"-\"We can still think our own thoughts.\"The first movie that came to my mind after watching the opening scene from this movie is Captain Fantastic. While both movies share similar themes as they can be classified under the Survival Movies sub-genre, Leave No Trace is a completely different film. What makes this movie different and special is what it implies not what it shows at all. Like Rebel Without a Cause, this movie demands from the viewers to put themselves in the main characters' shoes. Without doing so, you'll not be able to relate or feel anything, and the movie would feel very bland and cold for you. Because this movie in particular stands out from the other movies of its kind due toits non-dramatized approach to its subject matter. It feels so authentic and realistic, and that's exactly what some people find somewhat off-putting. But that wasn't, by any means, the case for me. I found this movie so moving, and I related to the characters so much.Without Debra Granik's nuanced and delicate direction this movie could have been stiff and boring. But Debra Granik added some small, yet very effective, touches to emphasize on some sweet memories, and therefore make them stuck in our heads, and, before everything, in our hearts to evoke a catharsis in the audience by the end of the movie.Both Ben Foster and Thomasin McKenzie delivered brilliant performances that feel as authentic as Debra Granik's serene direction. The result is a movie that massively succeeded to be heart-breaking without the slightest reliance on dramatic clich\u00e9s such as the highs and lows we often see in this kind of movies.All that being said, halfway through the movie, there was a slight tendency to continue the story in a formulaic way. Fortunately, that didn't happen. But that doesn't mean that I found the first, and especially the first, and the third act more cohesive, and more original as well. With more deviling into Ben Foster's character, Will, the second act could have been not only less flawed, but also potentially the strongest among the other two acts. With these problems, I found that I understood Will state of mind more than I felt it. That said, as the movie progresses I became more and more invested in his character, hence more emotionally connected to it.What really impressed me is Thomasin McKenzie's performance. Her character, Tom, is incredibly compelling and complex, and the way we get to know her characteristics from is absolutely genius! Just from the dialogue and the naturalistic way Thomasin McKenzie responds in every single situation we know that Tom is grateful, caring, honest and very frank, and afraid of change like her father, but also has an entirely different reason for being so.Leave No Trace is, first and foremost, a deeply moving humanistic tale thanks to its unconventional and unpredictable approach to its subject matter, and the honest and authentic performances from the underrated Ben Foster, and especially from the massively talented young actress Thomasin Harcourt McKenzie.(8/10)"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Leave No Trace follows a dad, who is ex-military, and his teenage daughter who live in a public park. They live in this park by choice, not necessarily out of necessity. They have a solid camp set up, a daily routine, and while the daughter doesn't go to public school her dad has homeschooled her very well. They aren't completely isolated, either, as they go into the city whenever they need to. But, one day a jogger sees the daughter while running down the trail, alerts the authorities, and they are scooped up and taken to a government agency. Eventually, they are let go and attempt to adjust to their new way of life in an actual house. That's as far as I'll go with story details, because that is where the story really begins. The story of Leave No Trace is not an exciting one. This is a pure drama and the true focus here is on the characters. We watch Will (the dad) attempt to adjust to living as a \"normal\" person in a house with a day job, while also battling his memories of war which often haunt him in the night. Living outside is all Tom (his daughter) has really ever known, so we also see how she adjusts and what she thinks about the average way of living in the U.S. Their struggle, and sometimes their inability, to adapt is what drives the story. This is a very emotional film as well. And by that I don't mean that it'll make you cry or tear up, but the emotion is so strong that it is almost a character itself. I was at full attention the entire time while watching this one. Everything just comes together in a way that easily makes this one of my favorite films of the year.Characters: The real reason why this film succeeds so well in what its trying to do is because of the characters and the actors playing them. Ben Foster puts in what I would call an Oscar-worthy performance as Will. We sympathize with him, we see the conflict within him, but we also question him at times because of how set in his ways he is. Thomasin McKenzie also puts in a tremendous performance as Tom. As far as I can tell, she hasn't had many major roles but she is incredibly impressive with her ability to carry scenes here. She's also very strong in the more emotional scenes. Cinematography: There are some great shots in here, but the real reason why I wanted to note the cinematography is because there is a use of symetry at the beginning and end of the story that really impressed me. It was such a simple addition, but it really helped bring everything together. Also, I loved that the director chose to use music so sparingly. There are some scenes where there is absolutely no music at all, only the sounds of the environment and dialogue of the characters. Overall: Leave No Trace is a terrific movie that very well could end up getting an Oscar nomination or two at the end of the year. The strong performances and the gripping story really make it worth the trip to the theater."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Deeply respectful of its subjectIn Walden, his 1854 memoir/philosophical treatise, Henry David Thoreau chronicles a period of two years, two months, and two days during which time he lived alone in a small cabin he himself had built in the forest near Walden Pond, Massachusetts, on property owned by his mentor and friend, Ralph Waldo Emerson. Inspired by the tenets of transcendentalism, of especial importance to Thoreau was \"Self-Reliance\", an 1841 essay by Emerson, which argues that an individual must avoid conformity, follow their own ideas and concepts, and trust in their own instincts if they are to attain a deeper understanding of the nature of existence. In Walden, Thoreau was putting this concept to the test, isolating himself from civil society, and existing in nature with only the barest means of subsistence (\"I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach\").Walden went on to become one of the (many) foundational texts of libertarianism, the core principles of which are the valuation of personal liberty above all else and the encouragement of scepticism towards authority in general, and the state/government in particular.All of which brings us to Leave no Trace, which could, perhaps, be described as a darker version of Captain Fantastic (2016). Directed by Debra Granik, and written for the screen by Granik and Anne Rosellini, based on Peter Rock's 2010 novel My Abandonment, the film tells the story of Will (Ben Foster), a veteran suffering from PTSD, who is living off the grid with his daughter Tom (Thomasin McKenzie). Making their home in a national park in Portland, Oregon, they embody many of the concepts underpinning Emerson's notions of self-reliance; individual authority, nonconformity, solitude, internal self-truth, with Will especially valuing freedom of thought. However, when a jogger sees Tom, park wardens are dispatched to track them down, and social services open an investigation into their situation.None of the philosophical theories outlined above are explicitly mentioned anywhere in the film. However, knowledge of them definitely helps one to more easily understand Will. Whether Granik or Rosellini are even aware of these concepts is beside the point, as they serve to give one a more assured theoretical entry point into a not easily penetrated film. For example, does one have to know that Will is at stage six of Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development to understand or enjoy the film? No, of course not. Does it help? Absolutely.On a less theoretical note, the film does a lot that on paper would seem to be wrong; for long stretches of time, there is no real sense of any kind of standard Aristotelian conflict, as we simply observe Will and Tom going about their day. In tandem with this, the film is extremely light on plot, incident, and tangible character development, focusing instead on mood and tone, and calling upon the actors to externalise their emotions through action and expression rather than dialogue. Obviously, this means almost everything hinges on the quality of the performances and the believability of the bond between the characters. Thankfully, both Foster and McKenzie are exceptional \u2013 he plays Will as someone who has seen the darker side of humanity and has no time for frivolousness, whereas she plays Tom as someone desperate to have a childhood, but who also wants to make her father proud. In one particularly telling scene, when they must leave on a moment's notice, he tells her to pack only what is essential, and she places a toy horse in her backpack, but only after she has wrapped it up so Will can't see it, an action which tells us a great deal about both characters.The film's pacing is both its greatest asset, and its biggest flaw. To speed things up would have compromised the tone Granik is going for. However, this kind of methodical pacing is likely to alienate a lot of viewers, who will undoubtedly criticise the film as boring, and its focus on Will and Tom to the exclusion of almost everything else as too narrow. When it does branch out (for example, a minor sub-theme is the treatment of veterans upon their return to society), it is only insofar as to show how the two main characters are affected. What's especially interesting about the story, however, is that the narrative seems predicated on the transcendentalist notion of the inherent goodness of people; pretty much everyone Will and Tom encounter is trying to do right by them, even the social workers are genuinely trying to help them. In the end, what the film gives us is a deeply respectful portraiture of a man trying to make the best of it in the only way he knows how."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Unlike other tales of wilderness survival, this movie centers not around the perils and hardships of the outdoors, but rather the indomitable human kindness that community can provide."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Debra Granik hizo notoria la carrera de Jennifer Lawrence el 2010 con Winter's Bone.

I find the plot interesting - the concept of people genuinely living out 'in the wild' so to speak. I thought it was quite an atmospheric watch and while the plot pace is quite slow and there's not a great amount of dialogue, I found it quite thought provoking, mainly in terms of it making me question how society rely on people living by their rules, or being judged harshly if not.I could imagine what the father and daughter were thinking, at times in which their not speaking but clearly expressing themselves by way of body language. They are clearly very thoughtful people. I tried to imagine myself in their shoes, to think how I might regard modern society as someone previously living in the outskirts of it. Its a thinking persons film, I reckon. Not everyone will enjoy it, it might bore some, given there's no action scenes, no car chases etc. but as a character driven drama with some interesting themes (identity, privacy etc.), it was an intriguing and thoughtful watch. I also particularly liked the use of music in the background to add to the atmosphere in certain scenes - I imagine this would be worth seeing in a cinema if possible, for it does have a sort of mildly claustrophobic feel to it at times. Its one of those films which may well have you changing your mind about your opinions on the characters at different times in the plot but suffice to say things aren't entirely clear cut. There is also  certain poignancy present. In any case, I didn't find it a boring film - I found it somewhat moving, if anything."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Beautiful, understated, expertly directed and the acting was flawless.
