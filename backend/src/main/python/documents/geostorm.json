Now,this isn't,like,another The Emoji Movie,but it's DEFINITELY not something i would spend my 10 bucks (or 20 bucks in IMAX) on. And,all honesty said here,i was actually excited for this movie,and now that i saw it,i can fairly say that 'Geostorm' is just another movie at the same level of the Transformers movies,where we wanted the action all over the flick,but we're just greeted with tons (and i mean TONS) of boring plot and subplot sequences. The story may be bland,sure,but it gets lazy and lazy throughout the movie and SPOILER ALERT (or not),the action sequences in the movie are the action sequences that fill the trailer to fool you once again into spending money,with the first action sequence (1 minute and 40-something seconds) of action dropping after 20 minutes of movie. I will only save the first minutes of the movie,since the beginning sequence is stylish with its story,and tells you about this somewhat interesting concept. During the story,expect some scenes that rip-off better movies,like Interstellar or Gravity (2013). Usually in a good or bad action movie,the special effects are something i always tend to save,but in here it SURE does lack the feel of an actual computer-effect. For example,there's a scene a-la San Andreas where a flood is taking over San Francisco and its Golden Gate bridge,but when it gets into the bridge,it's not being destroyed by the flood like if the bridge is an indestructible bridge. If 2012 (Roland Emmerich) scared the shoot out of me with its effects,i would laugh-out-loud with Geostorm's special effects. And what can i say about the acting? Well,let's say that Gerald Butler is just there because he needs a paycheck,as well as Ed Harris (?!?!?) and others. The music (by The LEGO Batman Movie's Lorne Balfe) can get...well,\"iffy\" at times,even if it's tolerable nontheless. In the end,Geostorm is just as great as an actual end of the world internet hoax. Don't expect some 2012 or Independence Day level of awesomness,because this movie is the opposite of what you'll expect.

But as the tagline so helpfully mentions \u201csome things were never meant to be controlled.\u201d We know where this is going, rogue satellites attacking the earth. Cue the extreme frost, tidal waves, tornadoes and a giant laser for some reason. Enter Gerard Butler. The best damn meteorologist in the world. With the super space station in danger only one man can prevent the looming Geostorm by rebooting it apparently. And that man is Gerard Butler. Hello Gerard, have you tried turning it off and on again?Geostorm is exactly what is advertises only worse. All you\u2019re expecting is something that\u2019s so bad it\u2019s good. That\u2019s the only thing these kind of movies have going for them. I mean I\u2019m not going to criticise the script, the acting and the plot, it\u2019s not about that. It\u2019s about entertainment value but Geostorm is a fail of epic proportions. You had one job and you couldn\u2019t even do that right. So what is wrong with it? Well the lack of the actual Geostorm for one thing. All the catastrophic weather disasters are all featured in the trailer and the movie itself adds little else. Most of Geostorm is hacking, more hacking, arguing, hacking in space and a kidnapped President. We also get people outrunning tsunamis and extreme frost. All things you\u2019ve seen before only better. So will it entertain you? No. A boring, eye-rolling waste of time.

Is it a ridiculous story?  Is it taking itself far too seriously too?  There are some movies, like \"The Room\", which are so bad they are actually funny.  The only think funny about \"Geostorm\" is that somebody thought this was a good idea and put a great deal of money into it.  Think \"Armageddon\" with an environmental catastrophe theme and an evil megalomaniacal government takeover just to make it even more convoluted.  Then mix in Gerard Butler, who is credible enough as a tough action guy, but let's make him a scientist, physicist, computer and aerospace genius.

You just have to sometimes wonder who even thought this was a great idea to show to people."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "No matter how fine their taste, I believe that anybody can enjoy an occasional B-movie now and then. The opinions differ only on what makes a good one.The president of the USA, far-reaching conspiracy, the world in danger, a few good (wo)men doing what is right, impending big disaster \u2013 if these keywords fit your cup of B, then \u201eGeostorm\u201c may have what it takes to entertain you for 109 minutes and leave a good aftertaste.When the network of satellites designed to control the global climate starts to attack the planet instead, it's a race against the clock to uncover the real threat before a worldwide geostorm wipes out everything and everyone.Most of the story actually takes place in space, so considerable part of the visual effects budget has been spent to show us the International Space Station, satellites and the big cold void that we like to call the universe. And after having your fill of \u201ecosmos porn\u201c, there are big natural disaster scenes to fall back on.The disasters dominate the promoting materials but are actually in minority, and mostly mercifully short. They look awesome but are not essential to the story and thus tend to even somewhat disrupt the general atmosphere and flow. Especially near finale, which is mercifully short too. Because good entertainment should always know when to end and not stretch over two hours or something.Starring Gerard Butler \u2013 the unsung hero and go-to guy to any self-respecting B- or generic movie \u2013 who is joined by a surprisingly large and impressive cast including Jim Sturgess, Abbie Cornish, Talitha Eliana Bateman, Adepero Oduye, Ed Harris, Andy Garcia, Alexandra Maria Lara, Daniel Wu, Eugenio Derbez, and Amr Waked.It\u2019s also worth noting that almost all major female characters are written as strong individuals and don\u2019t rely on their looks (although they do look good of course).This approach is something that freshens and updates the general vibe reminiscent of the big dumb 1990\u2019s movie that the director and co-writer Dean Devlin became really famous for originally, meaning \u201eIndependence Day\u201c. Back then, of course, he was just a writer and co-creator with Roland Emmerich, here he debuts as director too.But cool actors, strong female characters and even big-budget special effects will only get you so far, when the movie is lacking the most essential of elements: heart.And \u201eGeostorm\u201c has a lot of heart, which is the main reason I liked and enjoyed it so much \u2013 in spite of its weak storytelling where things mainly happen because they are ought to, not develop naturally.It\u2019s a minor miracle that despite all the unrealistic-ness and cheesiness of the story \u2013 it's a B-movie, after all \u2013 the actors are so spot on, full of heart and conviction that you just have to buy all this what\u2019s happening on screen.This is probably thanks to Devlin\u2019s brilliance at putting together this kind of big cheesy thing. It was about time he started directing too!Leading star Gerard Butler, in some movies just a poor man\u2019s Aaron Eckhart, is in especially good form, a shining example of how to breathe life into otherwise generic material, and grab us along with the ride.If you think that spouting all these silly lines and making it feel believable must be easy, as it seems for him, then you should try acting for youself.In a way, his charismatic work here feels as much an achievement as Matthew McConaughey\u2019s in \u201eInterstellar\u201c which is actually not the weirdest association if one was to compare the central themes of the two movies. But if this comparision seems too out-there, there are also parallels with many apocalyptic blockbusters from \u201eArmageddon\u201c to \u201eThe Day After Tomorrow\u201c.So\u2026 I liked it. \u201eGeostorm\u201c is certainly cheesy, but it does what it does really well.

In fact, there is stiff competition for the film's internal stupidity award. At first you think that the ludicrous \"science\" the movie seems to take seriously will run away with the win. But then you notice the atrocious \"acting\" and hammy dialog, and the race is back on. But to the astute viewer a dark horse should appear at some point in the appallingly inaccurate portrayal of American politics and the kind of swine who are now the only ones who could possibly become American presidents. If we're lucky he's a mindless party hack. If not, a crazed ideologue bent on world war. But, lo and behold and extreme sphincter contracting shock, the president is a hero in Geostorm. Who would have thunk it? Hollywood never does that angle to death, right? But this is not all, lest you are still not convinced. Cars explode as if they are not just loaded with explosives but actually built from them. Pompous music blares loudly over everything, because otherwise us poor peasants wouldn't know how to feel about things, there is a tacked on family intrigue as if people who build space stations and work in governments are real people instead of soulless sociopaths. There is even an unrealistic ninja woman, exactly like in The Matrix, except not good. And guns have unlimited ammunition. Hooray! And sprinkled on top are all the movie cliches in the world, from the main characters appear to die but are \"surprisingly\" hiding off camera to surprise the villain cliche to the blase banter that all Hollywood couples for some reason engage in, but which never actually happens in the real world cliche. And everything in between obviously: Door stops bullets cliche, the patriotic self sacrifice cliche, heroic president cliche as I mentioned, driving backwards while shooting a handgun at a pursuing vehicle cliche, speaking in code to fool the evildoers cliche, etc, etc ,etc. Trust me, it's jam packed with all the cliches you could possibly think of. I gave up counting due to extreme lack of interest at around 40. And they are not subtle either. They are completely over the top, with cue music for the dullards watching, as if things weren't already super obvious enough. GAAH!I'm sorry, but I'm burned out now. There are just so many idiotic things about Geostorm that I have a headache from trying to remember all of them. And not only that, but it is more globalist propaganda, evidently aimed at the lowest common denominator, to put it politely. The people who made this movie, whose names I refuse to remember, and for that matter anyone who takes any part of it seriously in any way, should be shot out into space themselves as a matter of public sanitation.

Unlike a cheesy fun disaster movie like Armageddon or 2012, Geostorms serious tone doesn't suit the cheesy fun set pieces. Armageddon was fun with plenty of cheese but that felt right in that movie because it didn't take itself too seriously and had comedy elements. Geostorm is super serious in its delivery and would have been less rubbish if it had stayed grounded and intelligent like Deep Impact or Twister instead of going wild with the plot and over the top scenarios. The acting is alright just bland characters with dull dialogue. The parts that made me go from disliking this to hating it was the nonsense Science, the cringe action scenes and the stupid twist halfway through. The science in this movie doesn't make sense and logic is out the window. If you like science you will hate this film. The action is mindless and cringy.

The twist of who done it and why that happens is so stupid and face palming bad, I laughed out loud. Worst big budget disaster movie to date, Sharknado of the big screen !"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "When it comes to recent disaster flicks, \"Geostorm\" is better than San Andreas, but is no Into the Storm. It's combination of silly sci-fi elements and political thriller plot is what keeps the movie going when cities aren't being reduced to rubble by monstrous weather anomalies. It's predictable for sure and the destruction itself is brought to life by some visuals that are slightly below par (the lightning is outright laughable). Yet, even with it's dopey plotting there's still some suitable entertainment to be found in a turn your brain off sort of way.Outside of a gaping plot hole the biggest issue with the story is the amount of clich\u00e9d family drama. The characters are of the cookie cutter variety and rather than focusing on the more effective form of emotional manipulation by delivering more moments between the main character and his daughter, Geostorm places it's emphasis on the sibling rivalry side of things. Some that is hindered greatly by Jim Sturgess' absolute twerp of a character. He is the definitive boogerhead little brother, complete with bad haircut. The dialog in this film is humorously bad at times. There are moments so stupid that you can't help but have fun with them. Part space adventure and part nature-fueled destruction fest, Geostorm can provide a good time if you can appreciate some cinema trash. It's a Gerard Butler movie for crying out loud. If you were expecting anything more than a dumb popcorn flick then you're an idiot. Only not the kind that will be able to appreciate Geostorm's surprisingly fun combination of the familiar and the ridiculous with a dash of good intentions that's all delivered with a straight face when it needs to be, but has no problem showing off it's silly side (like it had a choice)."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "You can tell that this was made my Roland Emmerich's partner Dean Devlin because this has all The ridiculous signature traits of disaster drivel dismay that made Emmerich's career. The characters are mediocre at best with inane intent and idiotic dialogue. This weather as a weapon plot was a decent concept at first and then goes into a dumb direction that really isn't properly explained well. The disaster scenes are really the only semi entertaining aspect of the film just because it's on such a massive scale and it's actually done well for the most part. While this is still better than San Andreas or day after tomorrow slightly, it's still a very dull film overall."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "This is the worst movie i have ever seen. It\u2019s so bad it actually pissed me off. How dare they do this to king leonidas"}, {"rating": "3", "text": "I've always had a soft spot for global disaster movies, between the recurring karmic overtones of our environment turning against us, the dramatic imagery and the insanely high stakes (read: world, the.) I can even see value in the more gratuitous schlock factor of the Armageddons and 2012's of the world, but this movie here... I can't.  Other movies would at least try and make the whole disaster scenario plausible, if only via layman-acceptable pseudo-science. \"Oh, neutrinos are suddenly interacting with the Earth's crust? Fine, I'll bite, just don't tell Stephen Hawking.\" Even the most bombastic rollercoaster flick can add some backbone with even a partially fleshed out principle behind all that destruction. In Geostorm, there is no such backbone. Instead of \"comsos rains destruction!\" or \"human meddling makes Earth stop spinning!\" or even \"global warming goes berzerk!\" we get \"guy invents thing that controls weather (because satellites,) other guy hijacks it for dastardly plot.\" Hell, nature is barely even a player in the story, just a side-effect brought on by the true mcguffin that is the big weather-maker-space-thing. Does it work by manipulating air pressures? Focusing microwaves? Shooting electromagnetic monkeys out of its space butt? We'll never know.It's not even so much a disaster movie as it is a tame cross between a Harrison Ford political thriller and Gravity (sans Harrison Ford or any remotely creative cinematography)    with a bunch of big, splashy set pieces thrown in for that blockbustery aftertaste. And that's just it: instead of being big, impressive high points that leave a mark on the viewer and help build a tense narrative, the disaster scenes are so random and unmoored from any feasible logic that they fall flat against the backdrop of the actual plot, leaving only a vague aftertaste at best. Tornadoes! Flash-freezing in the desert! Cities exploding from under people's feet! Hail the size of Buicks! By the time the obligatory tsunami scene rolls around, you can only slap yourself for not seeing it coming a mile away.As if this movie wasn't devoid enough of substance, expect to find some of the most tired big movie tropes spread all across this thing too. From the old \"countdown to Armageddon\" to the always trite \"father promise daughter,\" by way of yet another high-speed shootout (but with all this lightning n' stuff!) you're guaranteed to cringe once or twice. The real tragedy is that, against all logic, Geostorm did hold my attention... and I don't know of a movie that's ever done so with such a sustained lack of payoff. Not only is it pretty bad, but it tricked me into watching it to the end.I give it a 3, with extra points for having President Andy Garcia.And no, Dana, it's actually not \"you and I.\""}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Maybe because I don\u2019t go to see movies like this very often (what the audience reviewers are calling \u201cpopcorn movies\u201d), I actually enjoyed this film.

The countries all get together to create a vast spiderweb of satellites that all have magical powers to control the weather. Our hero Gerald Butler, who single handily invented and constructed all the satellites, is fired cause he tells it like it is and now the United States is ready to turn the satellites over to the world at large, but someone has taken control of the satellites and are making then do bad weather instead of good. Can our disgraced hero find out who is behind this and save the world in time?The Good: Well it's better than The Core. Abbie Cornish is pretty good as the fiance of the brother of the hero who is also the head secret service agent protecting the President who might be the traitor and who is the only person who can reboot the satellites. She easily has the best action scene in the movie.The Bad: Good lord where does one start. Well, let's start with one scene. Gerald Butler our Mary Sue inventor/action hero/tell it like it is the guy is going back to the space station he designed (and apparently built\u2026 with scraps\u2026 he found in a cave.) Keep in mind he is going back to the station he was fired from very publicly only four years ago. He meets with all the department heads of the station. None of them know who he is. Not one. He is the most famous man on the planet, he built the station they are sitting in, he only left four years ago, he flew up to the station in Space Shuttle like five minutes ago, he called this meeting, and he is wearing one of those Mr. Goodwrench shirts with his freakin name on it and the movie tries to do one of those OMG it\u2019s you moments.Geostorm has the trying to prevent the disaster plot rather than the much easier to script trying to survive the disaster plot. It takes a tight script and a skilled filmmaker to make a preventing a disaster film work. (God help us but Armageddon is a good example of the former while 2012 is a good example of the latter.) Geostorm doesn\u2019t have a clue. The science makes zero sense, The space station has a self-destruct button you can\u2019t turn off, the satellites are basically magical shooting heat death rays at Moscow and causing earthquakes so severe there is an 800-foot tsunami in the Arabian Gulf. Heck one of the satellites opens up to a luxurious two-person escape pod in a grown worthy moment that stands out in a movie chock full of them.Gerald Butler is awful and simply acts as if we would rather be anywhere else. Since he is in almost every scene that proves problematic. The rest of the cast, outside of the excellent Abbie Cornish, are well\u2026 there. The disaster scenes are decent (better than The Core but nowhere near the level of say 2012) but they don\u2019t really produce any tension since it is people you have never met before running away from admittedly decent video game graphics.In Conclusion: Geostorm is almost more famous for the endless bumping of its release date, the expensive re-shoots and budget overruns. I expect a movie about the making of this film would be more exciting than the movie itself. Heck, even a movie about one of the two disasters at the beginning of the film that prompt this whole satellite building scheme would have worked better. I am a softy when it comes to disaster films. Some Syfy movie where a school bus full of kids falls into a sinkhole can keep me entertained for ninety minutes. I also genuinely enjoy Gerald Butler movies more than most. This, however, failed to win me over. Still better than The Core though (Seriously who puts a windshield on a drill?."}], "recommendations": ["independence_day_resurgence", "the_tomorrow_war", "battleship", "2012", "shadow_in_the_cloud", "skyline", "war_of_the_worlds", "transformers_the_last_knight", "jurassic_world_fallen_kingdom", "the_darkest_hour", "district_9", "london_has_fallen", "into_the_storm", "jurassic_world_dominion", "the_core", "knowing", "army_of_the_dead", "transformers_age_of_extinction", "volcano", "the_predator", "bird_box", "the_matrix_resurrections", "national_treasure_book_of_secrets", "the_cloverfield_paradox", "infinite"]}
