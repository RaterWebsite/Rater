First they didn't have the budget of the Fast  the Furious which is evident by the stunts, which at times actually looked like a video game. I'm all for stunt men doing impossible things, and I don't mind good computer generated action either, however the CGI in Torque is just ridiculously bad, it is however nowhere near as bad as the acting. Instead of Vin Diesel and the dashing Paul Walker, the producers of this film settled for Ice Cube and some guy no one has ever heard of and trust me, the inexperience shows. This film is just as bad as all the other reviews say it is. Some poorly written, badly acted films, can be entertaining...Torque is not!"

There is no sense in the action, which lacks plausibility, entertainment and realism - 0 for 3 is pretty bad in an action flick. This movie looks to have been made solely for the egos of its actors, but none of them are serviced well."
