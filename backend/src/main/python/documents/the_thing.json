      "text": "This is the kind of movie that mistakes grotesque splatter scenes with real horror and a haunting atmosphere. It painfully misses Carpenters art of creating high tension just by the characters interacting. And speaking of characters, most are underdeveloped and look alike, so there is no point caring about them as they are consumed one by one. The special effects are now CGI, but the original effects are still better, because they are more organic. This movie had high potential, but it's just a big bomb nobody will care about in less than a few years."

From the reviews I had seen I was expecting a lazy rehash of the original but instead found a gut wrenching, highly convincing prequel that is equal to if not better than the original. Sure it isn't particularly unique, reusing general horror clich\u00c3\u00a9s and positively bursting with generic 'jump' moments, but the convincing and actually quite disturbing monster design and well structured storyline (though you can rule out any concept of character development) ends up in not just a watchable but highly enjoyable thriller. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the original or who enjoys some good old thrills and spills."

      "text": "This is a worthy prequel to say the least. While it discards the paranoia and careful considerations of the 1982 version, it instead chooses to create a sense of tension and urgency with even greater effectiveness. While some of the side characters could have used some work, the main characters were likable and sensible (A rare quality in a horror movie). The characters are as quick on the uptake as the audience, and the Thing, while showing less forethought than the 1982 version, is still incredibly intelligent and, most importantly, scary. Mary Elizabeth Winstead in particular gave a stunning performance. Along with some problems with minor characters seemingly existing only to be killed/assimilated is the issue of CG simply not being up to the standard of the old models used by the original movie. While the 1982 version is still king, the prequel is definitely a must-see."

It constantly maintained a certain level in intrigue that kept me interested to the very end, and even managed to go someplace I didn't expect for this kind of horror movie: inside of a space ship. That's all I should tell you about that subject, don't want to actually spoil anything. But anyways, aside from going to awesome and unexpected locations, the movie also is dark and shocking. After an expedition digs up a frozen alien body from the ice of the arctic, they accidentally unleash an alien disease that soon reveals itself to be a possessive and imitative method for the alien's reproduction cycle. Now, I know what you're thinking, that it's just another science fictiony zombie movie. Actually, it's nothing like that. I can't go into any more detail without spoilers, but I can tell you that the horror subject matter is unique enough from other sci fi horror franchises that it most definitely can be considered (reasonably) original. I liked how the plot developed, I like how nightmarish and dark the movie eventually turned out to be, and I especially like the direction it went in the climax. If you're completely new to The Thing franchise, definitely give this movie a watch. And even if you've seen the previous movies, I'd say this one's still worth your time."

What will it be next, who will it be, and when will it happen? These questions are what makes the story suspenseful and terrifying. Carpenter's version will always be superior but they came pretty damn close with this one. Definitely will be in my collection in the coming year!"

His prequels took shape as three massive dumps and then he used the original films as toilet paper. In the case of The Thing (2011) Matthjis van Heijiningen demonstrates how it should be done.When I first heard that this movie was in production, I had instantly assumed it would be terrible and like the Star Wars prequels, it would also serve to diminish the value of the original.I'm am delighted to say that it didn't. If anything, this new movie enhances the experience of watching the original.I watched the entire movie with scepticism. Waiting for gaping plot holes to open up. They didn't happen. The movie is tight and links up perfectly with the beloved 1982 version.I absolutely love this film. I don't think I can watch one without the other now.When the DVD comes out, it will get a place in my collection right next to the Carpenter original.At the time of writing this review:Critic score: 49User: 7.1A demonstration on what value you should put on critic scores.They've directed me towards a vat of absolute crud this year."

There are complaints about the monsters being in CGI. If the monsters were to be achieved by highly detailed models they may have looked way too comical to be scary if they were to move. ... To get a decent scary looking monster that doesn't look comical when it moves takes a lot of time, effort and money, possibly a hell of a lot more than a CGI beasty would take to make. ... The CGI doesn't look bad, there's been a lot worse in the past and these certainly don't deserve the bad rep the paid critics are giving them. I would say the CGI beasties deserve a bit more attention into their incorporation into the movie. something about them makes them stand out and only makes them a little obvious at times. ... That's a lot about the CGI, my apologies, I can't really complain about them, they look good enough so that's that. ... If you're a die hard fan of the original, just take this film with a pinch of salt and you should enjoy it. ...

      "text": "To start off, the new thing is a good movie. It isn't as good as John Carpenter's but it's still good. Before I mention the good parts of it though, I gotta mention the bad. One bad thing about the movie was the lack of suspense it offered. It's not a gorefest like some critics are saying, but it is more violent than the 1982 version and because the violence increased the suspense decreased. Simple movie facts. Also, as the movie trailer shows, the creature pops out of the ice in plain sight. If the movie was more about suspense and less about violence, like John Carpenter's film was, it would've definitely received more praise from critics. Another problem the film had was the lack of character development for a lot of the characters. You really felt like you knew the majority of the characters in the 1982 Thing, but the characters started dying so fast in this film, you were really only well acquainted with a few select characters. Finally, the last thing wrong with the movie was the lack of tension. John Carpenter's characters acted very appropriate for a situation like that. \"Stay away from me or I'll kill you.\" This is totally understandable and probable for people to act any these circumstances. The characters just didn't seem afraid of each other even after they grasped that ANY of them could be the thing, even when they'd separate off into groups. The good parts of the movie were good CGI, staying true to the story of the 1982 movie and tying both movies together well, and overall a very good cast with good acting. Overall the movie was much better than the average critic is rating it, but because it isn't an original idea, and it's not a phenomenal movie, the critic will want to slam it. Point being, it's a good movie, as you can see from the 7.8 user score from 33 users 30 of them being positive. Go see it. If you haven't seen either of the thing's before it, you will really enjoy, and if you have, you will still enjoy a modern view of a classic."

This film is a worthy successor to those entries created around John W. Campbell's landmark novella \"Who Goes There?\" from 1938.  That includes Howard Hawk's 1952 compelling interpretation and - of course - John Carpenter's contribution in 1982.  plot - good sci-fi relies on realistic but unusual mortal dangers inevitably imposed by the many weaknessses present in the human condition.

The 2011 prequel to John Carpenter's classic Science Fiction film THE THING is surprisingly well-made, and serves as a valid companion piece to the original film by filling in the events that preceded it. Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. and his team of set designers have taken great care in recreating the Norwegian base camp and following the frightful events just as they had been described in the previous film. The one major disadvantage that anyone would come to expect falls in the special effects department. Rob Bottin's ground-breaking make-up designs have terrified audiences since 1982, but the computerized monstrosities found here lose much of their effect despite their nasty appearances. Although THE THING presents several new twists on the plot points from before, the plagiarized ideas border quite closely to making this a direct remake. Mary Elizabeth Winstead and her supporting cast do maintain the proper amount of fear and paranoia to make this a successful sequel/prequel/remake, whatever it may be."

Just because it's not an excellent movie, which the 1982 The Thing is, does not make it a bad movie. Matthijs van Heijningen (the director) is a big fan of John Carpenter's The Thing and put a lot of though and effort into this movie in order to make it tie nicely to the events of the other movie, and to put the same details from the Norwegian camp into this one. The director had a tough task of both borrowing elements from Carpenter's film and staying close to the basic structure and story, but also making it new and different, so that fans of the 1982 film would want to watch this one and not see a less-good exact copy. I think the director pulled this off fairly well. He found the right balance between old and new imo. I won't go into detail about exactly what was old-ish and new-ish in the movie, as this might be kind of a spoiler and ruin your experience a little bit (if you're reading this and have not seen this movie). Now, let's talk more about this movie. The cast does a good job and the performances are mostly convincing. A bit more character development would not have hurt, though. The tone of the movie (music, atmosphere, tension), while not as effective as the 1982 film, is still there and works quite well. The story, plot, and especially the pacing was handled really well imo. Speaking about plot, there are some plot holes and illogical situations in the movie, which at times took me a bit out of the movie. The creature designs were cool, but they are mostly CGI, and while the CGI is fine for the most part, it relies a bit too much on it, and in a few scenes it looks rather bad. The CGI was especially noticeable in the end, and even though I liked the ending into the credits, the 5-10 minutes before that was handled a bit sloppily and was quite predictable. My main complaints of this movie are the lack of character development, the over-reliance on CGI, some plot holes/illogical situations, and the 5-10 minutes before the ending credits. But, overall this movie is as I said before, a good movie. I recommend it both to the fans of John Carpenter's 1982 The Thing so that they can see what happened before that movie, and to the people who have not seen that movie, so that they can first watch this one, then watch Carpenter's :)"

However, this film tries to copy the original, (and yes I realize Carpenter's was a remake of \"The Thing from Another World,\" which itself was a screen adaptation of \"Who Goes There?\" but Carpenters still stands as superior). We get scenes of testing to see who is an alien, but instead of a logical blood test they have a \"filling test\" wherein if someone doesn't have fillings, it automatically makes them an alien. As well plot holes abounded, the lead actress was mediocre, (especially when acting with an amazing supporting cast), and the tension rises but never reaches a real climax. In addition, it's sad when a remake has poorer FX than the 1982 film it's based off of... But that in and of itself says something about CGI versus real effects. Overall, it could have been a rare remake/sequel that could have been at least fun and entertaining. This is boring, gross and most of all - mediocre. Don't waste your time."

Unfortunately this movie suffers from hasty pacing, poor character development and insulting plot holes.  Unlike Carpenter's Thing, this creature attacks without provocation, often at times that are not in it's best interest for survival.  Early on in the film The Thing causes a fully operational helicopter to crash while it is on board and it's host isn't even suspected.  Good job Heijningen.  I won't go into the other numerous & obvious plot holes out of respect for those who want to see this movie.  Another disappointing feature of this prequel is that for all the effort that is put into making it congruent with Carpenter's movie, they change some very obvious events for no good or interesting reason. Remember watching the Norwegians using thermite charges to blow away the ice from the wrecked spaceship in Carpenter's movie? Thats not what happens in this prequel.  I'm giving this movie a 4 because it does have some redeeming qualities.  There is an amusing part where you get to hear The Thing observe the main protagonists cleverness.  Also, whoever worked on The Thing's design put a lot of love into making it look great.  Ultimately though this is just not the thinking persons Thing, for that stick with Carpenter."

In this case The Thing is one of my favorites and the script, setting, creature, etc is just pristine.

Well it does in some places but changes the subjects it gets it right, plays it safe, which is good because the original is a classic. Script is of course weak, weaker then the original but turned out to be excellent, well done special effects and creepy atmosphere. I really liked Mary Elizabeth.. I thought by the end she almost came off as a Ripley like character. Hoping it does well enough to get a sequel to that side of the story. I won't spoil anything but the ending I really enjoyed.. too many happy endings nowadays but this one was good. My brother and I enjoyed it so much might just see it again. My only points would be to improve the script, give Mary more speaking parts and maybe flesh her out a bit more.. only disappointment was the final creature, just was silly having the guys face plastered over it.. but just a nit pick more then anything. Great film and thats saying a lot since a lot of the horror flicks lately have sucked."

Nice and creepy, but still \"computer creepy\". There really is no substitute for real goddamn make up effects and prosthetics.  There is nothing as scary as Rick Baker's dog transformation scene, in the 82 version, in this movie.  Why?  Because it was really there, and you got the added benefit of an actor truly interacting with something terrifying. I digress. Also, design-wise, it seems to me that too many people in the CG world are being pooped out on a conveyor belt, thinking that in order to make something creepy, you just need to throw tentacles, a crab claw, and a lamprey mouth on it.  These are all terrestrial structures (as in, found here, on Earth).  The Thing is an alien. See the problem? The Rick Baker stuff uses all of that imagery too, but there's a whole lot more imagination going on there.  Aspects of this Thing's creature design seemed culled directly from a Resident Evil game. Some have brought up the tired old, \"Americans don't do subtitles\", or the even more specious, \"All Norwegians look a like\" crap, but none of that is responsible for my blas\u00c3\u00a9 score.  It is more based on a lack of design creativity, some cumbersome dialog, and some awkward direction, that really prevented this from being the home run it should of been.  Did I have fun watching it?  You bet your ass I did.  Would I watch it again?  If it was on TV I would.  And really, you do have to give it to Matthijs for putting everything back the way he found it.  On that point, he did an exceptional job."

      "text": "The Thing is a prequel to the original 1982 version by John Carpenter and it's done pretty well in good expectations. First, The Thing retells the story takes place in Antarctica in 1982 were scientists found the alien spacecraft in the ice. When the scientists discover the alien, it release out from the ice and the alien spreads everywhere to everyone 's inside their bodies. It was the same story just like the original one, but in the different way. Second, The Thing has decent characters in prequel. The paleontologist scientist Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), American pilot Sam Carter (Joel Edgerton), and other scientists play by many roles that are from Norweigian. The actors did pretty well, but Winstead did very good as the scientist and I like it when she's brave while she using the flamethrower to melt the aliens. Finally, The Thing has special effects to make it good, but sometimes it's a little bit different from the original. The effects are pretty good and the CG aliens are okay, but sometimes it will be better that they stick it the original were the effects that are made by in the 80's that is in stop motion scenes.\rIn my opinion, The Thing is pretty good and done perfectly to the original which is not a reboot, it's a prequel were they started the beginning until the next movie, so enjoy it!"

      "text": "In comparison to most of the recent remakes/prequels of the past few years (When a Stranger Calls(2006), Prom Night (2008), Halloween (2007), Friday the 13th (2009), A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010)), The Thing (2011) is one of the best.  In terms of the script, acting, and scares, this film beats out all of the films previously listed.  The script (although derivative) does its job, and also has a few clever twists and turns as it goes along. Mary Elizabeth Winstead gives a very good lead performance in a character role akin to Ellen Ripley in \"Aliens\", and carries the movie well as it progresses.  And the scares are well-timed and effectively built up with suspense.  That is not to say this film is as good as the original (it isn't).  But it is a clever companion piece to Carpenter's near masterpiece from 1982.  Most fans of the original will appreciate this one, and will enjoy spotting things as they fall into place.  Newcomers may also like this one for it's delivery of good scares and a decent story (something that is rare in most modern horror cinema).   Definitely worth checking out, especially during this time of year."

You have almost no connection to any of the characters, and the horror is overdone imo. The story is too plain and simple for my tastes. My advice? There are other and better horror's out there, ones with better story and characters. Keep your money unless graphical horror is your only reason to see a movie."

I am a really big fan of Carpenter's the thing, and was worried that this new prequel would drop the bomb and ruin the name. But it didnt, this movie was much better than i expected. Carpenter's movie is still better but this movie is worth the watch too. Acting, story, effects, atmosphere were all really good."

I did like the way they payed detail into the original, with the events and plot leading right into the beginning it.  When on DVD it will make for a good double feature.  I just wish they had a little stronger script, as I left the theatre think it was good but with some better writing it could have been great."
