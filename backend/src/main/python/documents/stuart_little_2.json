      "text": "My numerical score may not show it, but \"Stuart Little 2\" is in many ways better than the first film. It means well, has some great characters, solid visuals, and even more of the charm and humor that made the first \"Stuart Little\" film succeed. It's still no classic, but \"Stuart Little 2\" is certainly a winner."

      "text": "A Truly Nice FilmI liked this better than the original, and that''s a high compliment because I thought highly of the original film: Stuart Little. As good as that was, I just thought this was even better.All the voice-overs are excellent with Nathan Lane having the best lines as \"Snowball,\" the cat. He was simply hilarious, line after line.The film once again features great colors, a virtual rainbow of them, especially with some of the inventive rooms in the Little house. The parents, once again, are super nice. It's a treat to watch Geena Davis and Hugh Laurie play an old- fashioned \"Leave It To Beaver\"-type couple. The film has no objectionable material and leaves you with a nice feeling. There are animated films or animated/real life combinations like this, that advertise \"family-friendly viewing\" but don't really deliver, instead sneaking in sexual innuendos and the like.Not here. This one is pure, morals-wise, except for one scene near the end when the mom (Geena Davis) tells Stuart and their son she's still proud of them even though they just got caught in a big lie. (Inferring that the lie was okay since everything turned out okay.) Other than that, nothing but good messages were heard and seen all around and this is a funny movie, to boot. Highly recommended for the family, and that's no clich\u00e9."
