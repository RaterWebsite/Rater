Nice that the statue was made to the wrong dog, nice that in non-Disneyan reality Togo was first sold and then killed with euthanasia. A similar fate is desirable for all those children \"saved\" from diphtheria."

When the film was released, and I\u2019m started to watch, I\u2019m telling myself, \u201cWhy this movie not released in the theatre?\u201d It was a fantastic experience to watch Togo.It\u2019s a heartwarming and thriller. Cinematographer Ericson Core has done his best job in this movie. Cinematography and CGI are the best part of the Disney+ Togo movie. The way the director Ericson Core wanted to connect the entire story with us and he was successful in it. You will also become a little emotional while watching this movie. Willem Dafoe has done his best performance in the role of Seppala.You have to watch a Togo movie for a new adventure, thriller, and inspirational experience."

      "text": "This is a good Disney+ original drama about the 1925 serum run to Nome, Alaska, the same subject as the 1995 animated cult classic, Balto, although Togo is much more accurate to the true story than that film was. This movie features some really solid performances, with Willem Dafoe being the standout, as is usually the case. If you like dogs, definitely watch this movie! It has cute dogs everywhere, and I think they are mostly real with minimal CGI. I\u2019m always amazed at how expressive these animals can be and what they can be trained to do. The subject matter of the movie was very interesting, I feel like I learned something about history from watching it. It also features some really intense and thrilling action sequences that had me on the edge of my seat! I wasn\u2019t that into the structure of the film, it was told in a nonlinear way that kinda took me out of the experience sometimes. That, and I didn\u2019t think the cinematography or the editing were anything to write home about, but other than that this is a good movie that gives you a good old-fashioned triumphant feeling. It\u2019s worth a watch if you have Disney+."

This film also sets the record straight about Balto. Lauren was shocked. My only gripe is the blurry-edged border applied to the whole film. Other than that, loved every bit of this heartwarming and adorable movie."

      "text": "Togo is without a doubt a surprise hit, in my opinion. When it comes to dog centric films, I tend to not watch them because let\u2019s just be honest - most of them are sad. Beautiful, but sad. Togo may look like just another Disney dog movie, but it is so much more. This film blew me away from start to finish. And one really interesting fact about this film is it IS based on a true story. I even fact checked the movie after and was floored to find how truly faithful this movie is to the real events.If you grew up with the animated film Balto, I can\u2019t recommend the watch more, it takes the story of a dog mushing adventure that we loved as kids but made for the whole family - and especially us adults.  Willem Dafoe again proves his worth as an actor, giving a beautiful performance and Julianne Nicholson was a brilliant cast to back his character up. Give it a watch - you don\u2019t be disappointed."
