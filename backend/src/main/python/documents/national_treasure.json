The story might be one of the best ever made, and combined with the enormous well played actors, couldn't this movie be more awesome as it is. National Treasure is an exiting movie that keeps me entertained, and it's also funny. The amount of action in National Treasure is the greatest thing about this movie, because it's so fascinating and entertaining. Another thing that's great about this movie is the music, it's so damn good! The ending in National Treasure is wonderful, and the movie overall never felt boring at any time, which is why I'm giving National treasure a 9/10.\r National Treasure gets a 9/10"

Sure there was some faults here and there but personally I'd rank this on my top 5 N. Cage movies. I thought Sean Bean was great in this film and people that don't like it is probably because they already know about American History so they know that a low of stuff in the movie is BS but I didn't know much about the Founding Fathers etc so I guess I understood it more on a movie persperctive"

Nicolas Cage isn't quite as crazy, Diane Kruger is surprisingly good, and Justin Bartha makes one of the greatest comic reliefs in Riley I've ever seen."

      "text": "National Treasure is Disney's attempt at Indiana Jones and for the most part it works. The films are entertaining in the fact they are simplistic and yet well constructed. National Treasure revolves around Ben Gates (Benjamin Franklin Gates if you want to emphasise a stupid plot device) as he travels the US looking for clues leading to a treasure of unimaginable wealth with the assistance of Tech Wizz Riley Poole, Art Restorer Abigail Chase (if you didn't know it was a chase movie) and his father Patrick Gates. All the while they are trying to stay ahead of a rival treasure hunter Ian Howe. The film moves from set piece to set piece well with the film never really stopping to relax. This unrelenting pace makes the film thoroughly enjoyable. However they still make it easy to follow making the viewing easygoing which is exactly what is needed from a Disney film. That being said the film seriously embraces cheese both in its script and in some of the action and at times its hard not to notice. However the overall feel is one of lighthearted fun and that is exactly what you will have watching the film."

I've never met anyone who didn't like it. If you're into a mission impossible style movie this is a must watch. It has action adventure comedy romance and a happy ending, what else could you want in a feel good movie! It had fantastic twists all throughout, in particular the end. Its not the pianist or shindlers list- not all movies are like this nor would we want them all to be."

This film fits comfortably into the Indiana Jones style of adventure-comedy-romance genre. It may not be art, or revolutionary, nor challenge the viewer, but it's fun to watch, which is more than I can say for a lot of movies these days. If you like adventure flicks, this one is worth a look."

The plot is absurd, as is nearly every plot twist - but it's all done in good fun, and the turns are executed quickly so that you don't dwell on how outlandish the story is. In terms of a plot living off a massive conspiracy theory, it's more entertainingly executed than things like Da Vinci Code or Conspiracy Theory. Just like those movies, if you go to it for an education, you're asking for disappointment. This movie is good for fast-talking drama, mystery by way of adventure, and attractive people following absurd plans in the name of truth. It's just fun; don't look for anything more than that in it, or you'll lose it."
