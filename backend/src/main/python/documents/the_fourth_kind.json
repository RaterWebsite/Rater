They say this movie based on true events but they dont tell you what events it is based on. No part of this movie is believable. If this movie was real they still didnt do a good job with the story. They was so many missing parts and so many questions.  One of the worst based on true story or true events horror stories ever created.  Don't watch this movie."

The so called people who were abducted were ruled as intoxicated and wandered out into the woods never to be seen again. I'm thinking the director thought we would be stupid enough to believe the \"actual\" footage was real. Here's a headline: the actual footage is fake too. The actress that plays the \"real\" Dr. Tyler during the interviews is a freakn' ACTRESS. She isn't credited but IMDB blew that out of the water. Needless to say, this movie is kaka and I wont be watching anything else from this director."

What I hated most about this movie is the fact that the movie is SO bold, it says that the movie consists of ACTUAL FOOTAGE that PROVES THE EXISTENCE OF PARANORMAL ALIENS!! What the hell??? The movie can get violent at times, and its supposed to be real footage, and its rated PG-13!! Are you serious with this s**t? If its real footage, and your going to show the supposed real violent proof, make it rated R! And the people are supposedly real people, they say that they needed to change their names to protect their identities, BUT WE CAN SEE THEIR FACES!! Change their names all you want but we see who they are. I called bulls**t. Yeah, it's pretty terrible. I was looking forward to this movie and I was just DISAPPOINTED. If you like alien movies, don't watch this film, if you like paranormal movies, don't watch this film, if you like sci-fi, don't watch this film, if you like good movies, don't watch this film. Its pretty terrible. I can't recommend this film to ANYONE."

      "text": "An owl is \"the most imaginable evil on Earth\" and smells like \"putrid cinnamon\", according to one of Dr. Abigail Tyler's patients, whose description of an alien lifeform sounds so absurd, you start to half-believe that the sleep hypnosis videotapes are indeed real. Truth must be stranger than fiction, the moviegoer thinks, because what screenwriter in his right mind would use an animal so utterly unscary, so closely related to the Harry Potter movies(and books), unless he was forced to, due to the historical record which precludes his own extra-terrestrial inventions. A feral flamingo, perhaps? A penguin, even. Accepting the documentary footage as a non-fiction element, a starting point for Milla Jonovich(as the real-life Dr. Abigail Tyler) and her co-stars to recreate the events seen on video and heard on audio, makes or breaks \"The Fourth Kind\"(a bastardization of the narrative/doc hybrid form used in Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini's \"American Splendor\"), since the moviegoer is made self-aware that his/her suspension of disbelief is a decision that the filmmaker has already predetermined for the audience. Non-compliance with the alien abduction storyline as fact might be beside the point anyway, since the duped and unduped should be equally bored by the sheer hokiness of the archival segments interspersed throughout this relatively glossy docu-drama. Admittedly, the application of an existing academic institution's name in the graphics during a sit-down interview conducted by a writer with the \"real-life\" Dr. Tyler, gives the first-hand account an outward aspect of authenticity, as does the \"name omitted\" device \"The Fourth Kind\" uses during the doctor's sessions with her doomed patients(the same technique to preserve anonymity should have applied whenever the owl gets a mention.), but it all seems so pointless, so laborious, this fabrication, when the film is so lacking in suspense."

The best bits, I think, are the scenes were the doctor interviews her patients (via hypnosis) and draws out all the things they had tried to forget. Very convincing performances by the actors portraying the patients, for the most part. Jovovich is a competent actress but miscast here, given her spandex-zombie-asskicking background."

      "text": "Horrifying. The first time I watched this film, I felt chills and tingles go down the back of my neck. As a hardcore fan of the Sci-Fi genre, I was completely engrossed with this film. Some scenes are mirrored and occasionally display a dual-frame mode with actors on one frame and the \"real\" victims being hypnotised in the other. The score is eerie and is very befitting of the emotions at hand throughout the film. If you have any interest in extraterrestrials or abduction, this is a fine exhibition into that realm! However, once you realize that the \"real\" footage is all bull, this film becomes less horrifying."

However if you go into it and just roll with it and let the movie take you it turns into a pretty solid found footage movie.  And the actors in the found the footage did a great job especially the found footage DR.  Overall if you are a fan of found footage you will probably enjoy this movie or if you go in knowing little to nothing about this movie like I did you will have fun with it."

Fans of Fire In The Sky and Whitley Streiber's book \"Communion\" will love it. Highlights for me are the (fake) \"found footage\" sections which work tremendously well, less is more is used to great effect - similar to The Blair Witch in that regard."

This is why Blair Witch worked and The Fourth Wall doesn't. Here we get the usual alien abduction tropes you've seen a million times before, only much worse - with Milla Jovovich as the least convincing psychologist in movie history. Save yourself 90 minutes and watch \"communion\" instead."

      "text": "It's always a bit fun when a found footage movie affirms to be real footage and sticks with that claim throughout the film. You get to play along with the filmmakers and hopefully get a satisfying horror flick out of it. Movies like Paranormal Activity and The Blair Witch Project did this well, but some movies are a bit too ardent about their authenticity and come off as silly. The Fourth Kind fits somewhere in the ladder category. In The Fourth Kind, the town of Nome, Alaska is plagued by mysterious disappearances, murders and suicides in the early 2000's. A psychologist, Abbey Taylor, head hypnosis sessions with various patients whose stories seem to have distinct similarities, and Abbey realizes that she might be tormented by the same thing that afflicts her patients. The film mostly mixes found footage with dramatized versions of the footage, sometimes showing the \"real\" and dramatized portions side-by-side. For the most part, it's just aggravating. You'll hear the same dialog from two different actors at the same time on occasion, which begs the question why they didn't either go all-in with the found footage. The found footage scenes are the most intense parts of the films. Not necessarily scary, but they are visceral enough to be memorable. The dramatized scenes are melodramatic and dull. Surprisingly, the movie would have been much better if it was completely found footage. The Fourth Kind has some effective stretches here and there, but it's mostly a half-baked affair."

I never liked the \"base on a true story\" thing that's in every found footage film, but The Fourth Kind pissed me off so much that I couldn't finish it, because the movie sloppily adverse itself as a \"real life story\" of these strange encounters that never happened. The dialogue is laughable, the acting was unconvincing and everything in this movie failed."
