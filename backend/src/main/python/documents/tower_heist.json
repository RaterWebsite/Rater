He also enlists small-time crook Eddie Murphy to help. The story and characters provide an interesting setup and Murphy's appearance adds a sprinkling of laughs, but the heist is slow and the comedy is sparse. What starts out with energetic promise never builds comic or narrative momentum (although the out-the-window gag is pretty cool). As a result, the whole thing falls flat."

The plot was well developed, the characters were likable, the movie writers (and comedy writers for the funny lines) were clever, and I laughed at least a third of the time. The rest of the time, i was on the edge of my seat. The only reason I am not giving it a 10, is because of the language. I have to keep my standards up, and language will make me give it one less point."

Which is good considering we're bombarded with a game changing blockbuster franchise every three monthes. Plot is good, Ben Stiller and Eddie Murphy are back with picture perfect comedy after a failed few attempts, mostly from Murphy.The plot starts a little slow but gets going about 15-20 minutes in and gets more exciting every scene. The movie great for a rainy sunday afternoon or to watch with family or mates it might even make your DVD viewing rotation every now and again."

The backstory goes on for 40 minutes before anything starts to happen. Then the think it is going to be clever but nothing really materializes and it ends with a whimper. It was just flat at the end and left you wanting. Eddie Murphy is good but it seems like he is now the jinx for any movie he is in.

It was also weird to see him take a backseat in an ensemble cast.  I realize the concept was his, and it was a nifty concept, but leave it to Brett Ratner to be the poor man's Michael Bay: occasional flashes of interest, but no knowledge of how to tell a story via film.  The highlights were Gabourey Sidibe, who steps up during the funniest moment in the movie versus an FBI guard, and Matthew Broderick, who looks so old and chubby, but pulls off a teetering-on-the-edge former stock broker who has lost it all.  Unfortunately, the movie wastes the talents of Ben Stiller, Alan Alda and the always-underrated Tea Leoni.  If you miss it, you won't miss it."

The movie comes alive when Eddie Murphy joins the heist.  The heist itself is over the top and ludicrous but plausibility is not the goal of this movie, rather it is to make you laugh.  If you have a fear of heights, as I do, there is a prolonged scene during the heist that will make you squirm in your seat!  Alan Alda always makes a good bad guy, as he first proved in a Woody Allen film years ago.  I thought the acting across the board was good, and the film was shot well.  The only part that didn't work so well for me was Gabourey Sidibe.  Her acting is OK, but her weird Jamaican accent comes and goes.  There was no reason for the accent so they shouldn't have added it.  Not a great film but good.  Recommended, especially if you like Eddie Murphy."

The plot and action are so full of holes you could drive a Ferrari through but really its a comedy action flick what did you expect. I caught myself laughing out loud a time or three but if I did have one criticism it would be a bit of a comedic timing issue.

The only part that made me laugh was when Ben Stiller (as Josh Kovacs) and Eddie Murphy (as Slide) were talking in the car. Stiller said something like '' ....our partnership...'' (he's taking about them being in a team) and Murphy was like '' I ain't fuc*ing you're ass ''. Actually, the best thing about this movie was Eddie Murphy. The rest of the cast were okay, except for Casey Affleck, he played poorly. Also, the end seemed rushed. All of the sudden, everything speeds up (the events) and then it just ends. Plus, there are a lot of unrealistic situations, which makes me lose credibility of the story. I'm not giving it a lower score then 4, because there are worse movies then this that came out this year. Just don't waste time and money on this crap. I already forgot about it."

The \"master\" plan is so flawed it makes National Treasure look like Ronin. A kindergartner will be questioning the logic behind Tower Heist. A flawed plot in a comedy can be as forgivable as it is common, though this comes only with the exception of the comedy actually containing comedy. Throughout Tower Heist's oh-so-long 104 minutes, the audience will be subject to comedic gold, like jokes about lesbians and Burger King employees. Anybody familiar with some of Ben Stiller's movies, such as Zoolander and Meet The Parents, knows that he's capable of producing some absolutely memorable material. The worst part about Tower Heist is that my only laugh throughout the entire movie didn't come from Ben Stiller but from Eddie Murphy. What's worse than that is that this isn't even Eddie Murphy's worst movie (or Ben Stiller's considering last year's Little Focker's). Skip this one. Instead, go rent Ocean's Eleven."

The movie took its subject matter too seriously in my opinion, which made the jokes feel completely out of place. While it had some good ideas, they were never utilized in a complete, funny, or comprehensible manner. Granted, I thought Eddie Murphy had a funny character.

Ted Griffin, the screenwriter, gave us an interesting, smart, and amusing script for the first 48 minutes...and then he went on vacation and his 10-year old son finished writing the rest of it!  It left me scratching my head wondering how dumb and incompetent all the characters suddenly became, and how stupid, dull, un-clever, and implausible the plot line became.  Mr. Griffin's uneven script felt as if he wrote it years before he wrote Ocean's Eleven...when he was still learning his craft.  O-11 was a far superior film, even though the two movies are similar in many ways.  This movie had SO much potential but it fell WAY too short of reaching the \"good flick\" status it was craving.  Ben Stiller and Eddie Murphy worked well together and complimented each others talents tremendously.  I only wish that Mr. Murphy was on the screen longer because the film was only a \"comedy\" when his character was present."

Tower Heist is a movie about employees who seek revenge on the Wall Street swindler who stiffed them. When employees of a luxurious Central Park Condominium discover the multi billionaire who lives in the penthouse has stolen their entire retirement money they plot a mischievous way to get it all back.\rIt is present-day Manhattan and the Tower is a tightly run, high-class condo managed by a tightly wound, attention-to-every-little-detail Josh Kovaks (Stiller). Josh has gotten so comfortable rubbing shoulders with the resident elite especially the top dog at the top of his game and the owner of the Tower's top suite, Wall Street guru Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda) that he sometimes forgets he's \"not one of them.\"\rBecause of this he is stricken when Arthur Shaw is taken down by an FBI sting that reveals Arthur's billion-dollar fraud \u00e2"

This movie did surprise me though, aside from it's lame jokes, there is substance here, which include a pretty good story and an interesting cast. Ben Stiller is terrific as usual, but Eddie Murphy was not. I was never a big fan to begin with, but in recent years he has completely lost the ability to be funny and carry a film, the way he did with the Beverly Hills Cop series. Usually Murphy is an asset, injecting humor into an otherwise dry plot, but here his appearance actually takes away from the film. His character is both forced and uninteresting and I'd go as far as to say that this movie would have been better, if Eddie Murphy's character was just eliminated altogether. As I said earlier, the previews don't do this film justice and if you base what you're going to watch solely on previews, than you probably didn't see Tower Heist, and you're missing out. It is an interesting movie, that's different, and has a couple of twists in the story. Not an award winner by any means, but it's certainly something that will entertain you for a couple of hours."
