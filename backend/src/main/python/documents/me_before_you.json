'Me Before You' is an adaptation of the 2012 novel written by Jojo Moyes, it focuses on a woman in her mid-20s named Louisa Clark (Emilia Clarke of 'Game of Thrones'), who has been laid off a cafe that she worked at for six years. She becomes eager to find a new job fast in order to earn money for her family. She ends up finding work as a caretaker for a paralyzed man named Will Traynor (Sam Claflin), who was left unable to use the rest of his body after an accident of being run over by a motorcycle two years before. Louisa tries her best to bring some sense of joy into Will, who is cold and cynical since he became paralyzed. She tries a number of different things to lift his spirits, but for a while, nothing seems to work. It also seems that Louisa is putting her work before her boyfriend, Patrick (Matthew Lewis), who becomes frustrated when she cannot find the time and effort for him, and is spending more time with another man whom she's only known for a few months. She becomes tired of Patrick's jealousy and he becomes tired of her inattentive behavior. Louisa also learns the harsh truth about Will, she decides to take him abroad on holidays and making him realize that just because he is paralyzed, there is no stopping him. They end up falling in love. 'Me Before You' is a well-made romantic drama, and Clarke and Claflin do share some terrific chemistry that should hook even the most cold-hearted movie-goer. But, underneath all that drama, and all those emotions lie a very paint-by-numbers and cliched love story that we have seen time and time again. It reminded me of a French movie called 'The Intouchables' (2012), or \"Untouchable\" as it is called in some countries. That movie worked because, well, it wasn't necessarily a love story, but we got beneath the characters there. Here, you just have a typical, happy-go-lucky girl taking care of a devil-may-care, crippled man. I admired the characters for a while, but once I knew where the plot was going, the spark fizzled out. I'm sure even those who haven't read Jojo Moyes' book, and has seen every romantic drama ever, will know how the movie will start and end. Good effort for the most part, but utterly predictable and not quite as special."

The romantic film goes through a fatiguing period, tired of the renowned \"clich\u00e9s\" of the genre; implausible is find feature romance films like the stories written by the talented Nicholas Sparks - \" The Choice \", his last invention does not achieved good receptions -, apparently, this film genre will be condemned to the adaptations or reboots of Hollywood, nevertheless, occasionally, small underutilized gems come to light.\r Emilia Clarke - Yes, the blonde girl of \"Game of Thrones\" and Sarah Connor of the massacred \"Terminator Genisys\" last year - plays Louisa \"Lou\" Clark, a eccentric young lady, who lives with her working-class parents. Lou loses her job in the coffee shop of the village, which puts her in a delicate matter, lack of money. Her only employment oportunity is to be caretaker of a 30-year-old man suffering paralysis of the shoulders down - owing to a motorcycle accident -, that handsome man with sense of black humor, sarcastic attitude, million euro in his bank account, hardened heart, and possessor of a perfect smile is Will Traynor (Sam Claflin has acuity to make to cry ( remember to Finnick Odair of \"The Hunger games\"). With a black and white striped coat, dresses with butterflies and vegetables, psychedelic heels and other strangenesses of the fashion, Lou invades in the life of Will to superficially transform his thoughts, thoughts decided to practice his assisted suicide at a clinic in Switzerland. Striking, cloying and sentimental plot, dispenser of laughs, tears and doctrines do not focused.\r \"Me Before You\" does not get away of the habitual absurdities of a romance novel, perfect for lovers of the genre, but tedious and repetitive for the general public. Despite the exhausted use of romantic elements, Moyes, Neustadter and Weber know to place and represent every triviality  harmoniously, the first kiss, Clark shaving to Will, a powerful storm behind the female lead role and even avoid some recurrences to innovate with own circumstances and phrases (Bumblebee Tights). Repeatedly, we have seen impossible loves owing the difference of social classes, and although the difference of status is present, the film is focused in another type of differences. The script fulfills the demands of any woman in love with chocolate and popcorn, nevertheless, objectively, it violates the real context with impossibilities and events of tales of fairy, hiding the suffering with the beauty, the reality with pink unicorns e hippopotamus, and until certain point is refreshing and requested for the genre, nevertheless, it is its sensitive subject in the ending, which be really affected by the strategy , and therefore, it affects the film in general.\r Thea Sharrock - writer and film and English theater director - follows the story of the book to the letter, neglecting necessary and original ideas. Who do you wish to listen to Ed Sheeran, while you are on the verge of tears? Pop music atmosphere is profound and even memorable (Not Today by Imagine Dragons), unfortunately, these are located in incorrect times, destabilising the balance and the process of the scene. Furthermore of its youthful soundtrack, the performances hold firm progress of the story, Clarke does not exaggerate her character, and if she does, it has satisfactory effects and thanks to her beautiful and infectious laughter, development gets a decent progress. Caflin is a bit more discreet and without Clarke as Lou, it would have been a matter of seconds. Nevertheless, it is the swift development of a controversial issue which absorbs the negative criticisms. In the plot, Will is decided to die with dignity, (Spoiler: and he did it), the film portrays the life of disabled people as \"different\" and in certain part it is, nevertheless, the lightness with that they deal the ending is as necessary as negative. Necessary, because they do not turn to the romantic drama of the path towards death, but negative, because they insinuates that the days of a disabled person are useless and the best solution is suicide. \"Me Before You\" has the function of telling a love story, the film did not want to meddle in dangerous waters, but, unfortunately, it did it.\r \"Me Before You\" benefits from the chemistry of its protagonists, the idealized environments and some lines worthy of Spark, but the futility of euthanasia in the film, destroys the built and paves the way for finding some errors more. With the quality of the romance films of today, \"Me Before You\" is a tempting and sentimental proposal, full of corny-romanticism, teaching rewarding lessons as go on, live each moment and question the unexpected turnaround of life."

Now that that's settled, let's move on.\r Me Before You is half good and half bad. The good is that there are many hilarious moments in the film and great cinematography. This gives off a warm and cheerful feeling. The acting performances are also above par. The story itself is unique as it talks about disability and controversial life decisions. It's certainly better than a lot of other romance movies.\r Here's the bad. First off, while the story is unique, the way the story is told is in the most cliched manner possible. The characters are all stereotypes- cheerful and perfect main character, grumpy rich dude, and goofy douchebag boyfriend. This makes it hard to relate to the characters. The ending is also predictable and many story elements are contrived. This also is super melodramatic as the music and backgrounds force the viewer to cry. Not to mention that the film lacks the intelligence to fully explore the subject of disability and life choices.\r Overall, Me Before You has its goods and bads. I should note that while I didn't cry at all, 95% of the mostly female audience did. I'm just not the target for this kind of film. In the end, Me Before You is just mediocre."

I only wish that the film was given more publicity as it presents a very real set of circumstances which some disabled people face and I think this film is not just for entertainment purposes but to also make people more aware of disability and romance, in addition I hope that there are more films like this in the future which cover a similar topic or situation. I felt that I was able to relate to the film. Despite my overall positive reception of the film I am a little disappointed by some aspects of the film for instance some aspects are a poor representation of real life and its a little frustrating to see this inaccuracy in the way it is presented. I was particularly annoyed with how it presented this attractive young woman falling in love with a disabled man in such a way that almost made it feel as if it was out of pity than anything else, and if it was a representation of real love then unfortunately, in reality the chances of an attractive young woman falling in love with a disabled man are very slim because sadly many people are too shallow.

Focusing more than half of the running time in glib romance, there are some funny moments between the main characters that are enjoyable but the development of the plot has wasted several important thought provoking themes - controversy of the suffering between the disabled and the people around, struggle to live and find courage to regain confidence with physical impairment, sensitive subject on committing suicide and self willingness to survive as well as care, support and inspiration from a true love. Both Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin deliver their performance well while the choices of songs are pretty beautiful including the powerful scores composed by Craig Armstrong yet all these are unable to compensate the poor character and relationship developments. Perhaps the story should have reorganized by adding on more depth into the sufferings of the handicap, further converting into some positive inspirations rather than just steamrolling the value of life."

It teaches you something about human existence and strength.\rThe other, Me before You, is a fictional romantic comedy idealisation of suffering with cringe-worthy acting, poor direction, glib soundtrack choices and offensively on-the-nose dialogue. It is also, incidentally, about euthanasia. But not in a serious way. That would be too correct and not fun.\rI found the former utterly rewarding and a delight, and the latter utterly offensive. As someone who has had a serious illness, and with at least two years where I seriously did not wish to exist, I can see how in the absence of potential for recovery and with the presence of great pain and infirmity, euthanasia might become a viable option. There is a serious film to be made about such things. It should be well-acted, with greater insight, directorship, and dignity. It should be on-the-nose in the right way. Maybe such a film already exists, I am not any sort of film buff.\rBut what it should not be, ever, is a whimsical sexual fantasy for working-class females."

The acting of Emilia Clarke was like Rene Zellweger as Bridget jones x 1000. So over the top klutzy and cutesie. It was ridiculous that the character is described as 'working class Cornish' but has an accent that the Queen of England would be proud of. It is also far fetched that someone working in a failing Cornish cafe on the minimum wage (and we woudl rarely tip in such a place in the UK) was supporting a family of 4 plus her sister's baby. Her gurning and eyebrows were very distracting and I couldnt take anything she said seriously. I didnt 'buy' for one minute that Will had any romantic interest in her and it came across that she had just become a good friend. I kept expecting something exciting to happen, but it never did and the whole film ended on a predictable whimper. In fact I have just realised that the whole film is like what Americans believe we live like in Britain, but that .5% of the population do. It was just schmaltzy cliches from beginning to end. Why did she get teh job at the interview? She had no experience and answered the questions with stupid answers? Who on earth were the other candidates, apparently there were some. I dread to think. I think from that moment of complete ludicrousness I guessed correctly this film would be just a crazy mess that made no sense but played a few nice, if not depressing, songs. Did it make me cry?

It was \"The Fault In Our Stars\" all over. People don't need these kinds of movies. They will watch them once and that's all. They will NEVER want to destroy their days watching it twice. A movie does not need to make people laugh, just to make them feel good and even optimistic sometimes.

Initially they both won't fit for each other, but after some time everything changes when they together do some outdoor activities. While the film progress, it only gets more emotional. Besides, it's fun watching the first two acts, particularly the performances from both the lead strikes strongly.\r After a very long time I watched a good tearjerker, but not that strong. It is a simple story, there's no big adventure or romance in it. That's right, it is not a romance film and if you decide to watch expecting one, you will be definitely disappointed. Also slightly it delivers a bad message like the negativity for being one seriously ill and alive. This issue is only on the humanity ground, but afterall everyone entitled to do what they want, because it's their life.\r Anyway, the film avoids the usual clich\u00e9. Like there's no scene that you had seen in other similar theme repeats here. Deliberately avoided to make it a fresh piece. Basically, if you observe closely the both two lead characters, they had a different agenda about their life. Particularly the caretaker never ever tried anything seriously to accomplish her undertaking.\r On the other hand, those parts were very realistic, but still gives us a cinematic experience due to the fancy screen presentation. Surely a good watch, I think everyone should watch it, because there's no drugs, sexes or nudes or even the strong kissing scenes. Only the main theme is something disturbing, particularly for the tender-hearted people. Other than that, I hope you watch it if you haven't yet.\r 7/10"

      "text": "Okay so I actually dug this one. Is it wickedly cliche? Yes. Does Emilia Clarke have weird eyebrows and a smile that literally consumes her face? Yes. Yet, like a mozzarella stick with stringy cheese or a cake with a thick layer of frosting on top, Me Before You is so cheesy and sweet, it is irresistible. From beginning to end, it was the film equivalent of taking said mozzarella stick and seeing how far you could pull the cheese before it breaks.\r Starring Emilia Clarke as Louisa Clark, a lower class girl from England, Me Before You is a film billed as a romance, but for me, it almost came across as decidedly anti-love (or, at the very least, denying the power of love to a degree). The unsuspecting Louisa is hired to work as the hired to be the caretaker of Will Traynor (Sam Claflin), a now quadriplegic man who was once an active and vibrant young man. While he still may be that man, Will most certainly does not recognize this. For this element, Me Before You could often double as a harrowing look at how depression can consume you. From beginning to end, the audience is shown the life within Will. Louisa most certainly brings that life out of a him like a flowing river, in large part due to their delicious chemistry, but Will does not see this. Instead, he looks forlornly at his life before his accident and is often confronted with this element, whether it be through his ex-girlfriend, his constant bouts with pneumonia, or old photographs. Around every turn, he is reminded of who he was. It is this element that courted controversy as people deemed Me Before You to be stating that death is the only acceptable path for disabled people. This, to me, is misguided. Rather, the film is an exploration of the depression that took a hold of Will after his accident. We know he is still Will. Louisa knows it. His parents know it. Yet, Will cannot come to grips with this drastic life change. The end result is a film that showcases how love cannot overcome all. It is not the prescription drug that will fix every situation. Instead, one must love themselves when they look in the mirror. They must be okay with who they are, for all of their unique elements. Without this, nothing will break the hold of one's own mind.\r While Me Before You's romance may be quite cliche and its soundtrack lifted from every teenage girl's iTunes account (two Ed Sheeran songs, including new romance film staple, \"Thinking Out Loud\"), but its thematic elements regarding depression and self-acceptance are so deeply moving, I can easily look past its faults. It is an imperfect film with a spotty performance from Clarke in the lead role, as well as a pretty nondescript one from Chaflin who is good, but nothing incredible. The scenery is impeccable and most certainly capitalized upon with some stellar shots of the views. Additionally, Louisa's relationship with ex?-boyfriend Patrick (Matthew Lewis) does nothing to make the audience like her. Rather, she is cheating on him with Will. This poor characterization is a blight on the writing and only exacerbated by Clarke.\r Between cheating and incessant eyebrow movements, the film can easily become grating if it were not as tearjerkingly melodramatic as it is, which is fine since i love a good melodrama. Clarke and Chaflin have great chemistry, but the real quality of this film is in its exploration of this depressed man's last days and the realization that love cannot heal all wounds. It is like painting a wall to cover a hole in the wall. It may brighten things up or change things up a bit, but the hole is still there and must be addressed in some other way. For Me Before You, its guts in sticking to this life truth is impressive, but also thoroughly heartwrenching to watch unfold. Get the tissues ready."

Very strong performances from Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin along with great chemistry. The movie was very touching and emotional at points, and I was very engaged throughout the film."

A movie with drama genre, hooking you up for the whole time is worth this rating.*Spoiler*I don't know what is with the critics or the low score, but I think it was okay for him to choose death. He was an intelligent man. He knew he couldn't face the fact that someday she will regret having married him, even if it's for an instant it would kill him seeing her like that. The little happy moments that he had were tearing. And Emilia did really really great for a cheerful girl. I do think Emilia overdid it at one or two places though but that is okay.I loved this movie very much!!!"

At the same time, a family is looking for someone to take care of their son, Will, who had an accidental injury. A few years ago before he met her, he had a traffic accident and his body was paralyzed except from his neck up. Through her job, she fell in love with him.Will had been suicidal for a long time. When Louisa figured this out, she organized various trips and adventures to show Will that life is worth living, despite his disability. She planned some enjoyable activities and they had a lot of fun. However, he didn\u2019t change his initial plan to kill himself because he thought he would never make her happy and also he wants her to live a normal life. In the end, he wrote a letter for her and took his life with dignity.A few weeks after Will's death, she went to Paris and she reread the letter. In it he told her to \u201cjust live well\u201d and he left her enough money to follow her dreams.Actually Me Before You was originally a book. It was written by Jojo Mayes. It was published in 2012 and a sequel titled After You was released in 2015. The film was released in 2016. It received great literary acclaim, including being nominated for a Goodreads Choice Award. The movie stars Emilia Clarke as Louisa Clarke and Sam Claflin as Will Turner.I usually watch a mystery movie like Saw instead of a romantic movie. The reason why I watched Me Before You is my favorite actor stars in it. Now it has become my favorite movie not only because I like him, but also because I like the story.I didn\u2019t know about dignity of death at all, so at first I didn\u2019t think it\u2019s good way to relieve from suffering because it\u2019s a kind of suicide. However, through watching this movie, I understood how he felt so bad about his life. This movie is not only serious but also funny sometimes because Louisa is very outgoing and funny. Will had become a different person because of his traffic accident, but thanks to her character, he became like he was before he had the traffic accident.Some people say that this promotes view that people are better off dead than disabled and it has suffered a backlash from many people in the disability rights movement. I can understand why they think so but this movie is worth watching. Since I think dignity of death is not a familiar topic for us, it gives us a good opportunity to think about it. If you watch this movie, you will definitely change the way you think about dignity of death. I hope you will like this review and watch Me Before You."

Sure I understand the criticism behind the general message some people might receive about disability but that part of the story is in the books and they weren't gonna give it a brand new ending. It's a beautiful love story, take it as that and you'll be very pleased because both actors are very charming throughout the whole movie."
