Personally, I appreciate, that it is related to real life, maybe not only related, but also it represents the picture of most people's lives - not knowing who you are, strange relationships and everyday struggle with family members and friends, problems in school and in finding university and intimate life. So, I appreciate the focus on that. It's teen drama though. It says the movie is drama and comedy, didn't rally feel the comedy there. \"Yes, I gave that name to myself. It is given to me by me\" - that was fun haha! Anyway, I am used to teen comedies and I didn't get that movie as comedy.  Somehow, soundtracks weren't enough and the script wasn't something special.

Written and directed by Greta Gerwig and starring Saoirse Ronan, Laurie Metcalf, Lucas Hedges and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. I've never been a massive Saoirse Ronan fan but she played this part perfectly. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is so insignificant I almost forgot he was in the movie, Lucas Hedges gives another great performance but for me it's Laurie Metcalf as Lady Birds' mother who stands out above the rest.Christine \"Lady Bird\" McPherson is in her final year of school in Sacramento, California. Longing to move away from her home and to where \"culture is\" the story follows her and the every day problems facing a seventeen year old girl. Lady Bird is a very emotional movie not only because it deals with issues many of us can relate to but it's one of those films were the acting gradually disappears and you feel like you're watching real people with real problems. Lady Bird's relationship with her mother played by Laurie Metcalf for example is perhaps the strongest element in the movie. An onscreen relationship that from the very opening scene feels remarkably genuine. Laurie Metcalf gives a brilliant performance, and will definitely hit you with all the feels. There were a couple of ideas brought into the story that were dropped and had no follow up and for me the ending was a little dissatisfying. I found this quite frustrating but Lady Bird is a great coming of age movie that you're sure to enjoy. Highly recommended."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Lady Bird is a pretty good coming of age movie.

Sorry, I don't care for another high school story, where the main character ditches her best friend just because she wants to hangout with the cool kids (SNORE). The cinematography wasn't bad, but it was pretty repetitive and bland as the film progressed. The directing the pretty standard and the writing just felt mediocre. In the end the actors helped lead the story in a non destructive way, so it kept me interested.

The writing and direction from Gerwig was witty and spot on quite often. However, like I said, it didn't really transcend or bring too much new to the table in terms of high school/coming-of-age comedies. Despite this however, the film contained a lot of heart and undeniable charm and humor throughout overall. Definitely worth seeking out."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Lady Bird gives an admirably honest look at adolescence, family, relationships and the importance of being yourself, while managing to stay surprisingly grounded and authentic. The acting overall is pretty great with some real stand-out performances by Laurie Matcalf and Saoirse Ronan. Unfortunately the story lacks the originality to transcend its genre, but as a coming of age movie Lady Bird is really good, probably the best of its kind since Juno.

Still I'd wholeheartedly recommend it."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "One more case in which I must row against the current and discover something that a person who had already seen this movie told me, apparently you cannot give a negative opinion about this film and considering what I have seen now that I have finished it, I will undoubtedly be crucified by many, but being quite honest for everything they mentioned about it and the huge avalanche of positive reviews it received, in my personal opinion, Lady Bird is one of the biggest disappointments of the year and yes, is perhaps the most overrated movie of the year along with Get Out.Lady Bird tells the story of Christine \"Lady Bird\" McPherson, a young woman who lives in Sacramento in 2002, regardless of certain narrative resources that the movie does not need to use, like social networks and smartphones, the time frame in which the film takes place it couldn't have been more irrelevant.My biggest problem has to do with the main character and when something like that happens, you know it's serious, personally my adolescence flew away many years ago, but for me now as then it would be quite clear to expose Christine as a spoiled, selfish and narcissist brat that at all times and in all situations, she only thinks about herself. Everyone is wrong except her. She also lives complaining about the life she has while doing nothing to change her environment beyond the fact the she's trying to enter an out of state college just to leave the place where she feels locked up, not caring at all that her parents are facing financial problems and have made it clear that supporting her financially is not an option, but she doesn't care because like in many other coming of age films, the ''teenagers'' believe they are being repressed in their place of origin and so their talents are not properly exploited. Clich\u00e9 and repetitive.The true strength of the film and the story in general lies in everything that surrounds her, that's the best reason to see Lady Bird because most of those characters have more serious problems and forge what she does regardless of whether she believes that's not the case, starting with her mother and her father, it's true that her mother presses too much, but come on, you have to be honest, it's not like Lady Bird leaves her with so many options with her childish tantrums.Her father is unemployed and struggling with depression trying to provide for her family and yet Lady Bird's concerns lie in what she will do, avoiding helping in any way.Her boyfriend, her best friend, the guy with whom she loses her virginity, her momentary and popular friend, her adopted brother and her girlfriend, all form a protective halo in a narrative mode because it's the conflicts of those characters what sustain this movie, otherwise Lady Bird wouldn't have been more than just a movie of another teenager incapable of deciding what she hopes to do with her life and that situation has is been seen already too many times in both cinema and real lifeThe film gets recomposed in its final section where the character absorbs a bit of maturity and enters a new stage of her life, the ending makes it clear but until that point we can only infer what will be of her in the future and perhaps she will become a better person and certainly then she could have been a better character, but it wasn't the case and for me that diminished my enjoyment and enthusiasm for the film in a big way.I admit that Saoirse Ronan does a good job, but on front of such script, unfortunately the character doesn't stop being annoying. She manages to give it a little more strength for being a great actress, otherwise I think that the character would have been lost miserably.Greta Gerwing delivers a film that looks good, that has an uneven but sustained rhythm.

This film has blown me away and might be the best film I have seen all year. It is full of sincerity and wit that kept me laughing the whole way. Greta Gerwig has created characters that have never felt more real on the screen. The film\u2019s focus is on the struggle between its two lead female roles, effortlessly acted by Saorise rose, who plays a 17 year old adolescent eagerly trying to escape her hometown of Sacramento, which she referred to in the film as \u201cthe Midwest of California\u201d, and her strong willed mother Marian Mcpherson, played by Laurie Metcalf, a psychiatric nurse struggling to make ends meet amid economic hardships of the early 2000\u2019s and after her husband, Larry Mcpherson, played by Tracy Letts, loses his job. During her senior year at a private catholic high school, Soarise Rose\u2019s character, Christine McPherson, who prefers to be called \u201cLady Bird\u201d, yearns for new experiences as she continues to form new relationships and friendships throughout the film. Her venturesome personality has overcome Christine\u2019s will to find common ground with her mother, who is more of a realist and wants Christine to understand the poor financial situation her family is in and the obstacles present that prevent Christine from traveling away for college. Her mother coldly pushes this mentality on her daughter, but fails to demoralize Christine from wanting more, and fighting, though not fully driven academically, to gain admission and financial aid to attend an east coast university, where she might \u201cfind more culture\u201d, through the assistance of her clinically depressed father who is more sympathetic of Christine\u2019s ambitions. Soarise Rose\u2019s character is a great depiction of the compulsive and pleasure-chasing mind of an adolescent that will have you feeling nostalgic and emotionally attached.

Their dynamic personalities, perfectly portrayed on screen, will have you anxiously wanting to continue following the rest of their stories."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Enjoyable but unoriginal. Lady Bird is a well made coming-of-age story, but it doesn't bring much new to the table.

Enjoy the fine performances by Laurie Metcalf and Saorise Ronan (even though she seems a bit old to be playing a teenager), and laugh at the offbeat, unexpected humor, but don't expect groundbreaking cinema from this somewhat-overhyped offering.

For those who wish to re-live the experience, nobody does a better job at capturing those puerile years full of emotional yearning and social dread than America's indie princess, Greta Gerwig.Gerwig's writing is invariably grounded and concise--she's the Hemingway of film.  It complements the small yet densely textured worlds that she creates and explores, reminiscent of those artists who paint miniature landscapes that need to be admired through a magnifying glass.'Lady Bird' is more than just the continuation of Gerwig's impressive filmography.  It's her quintessential film.  The dialogue is crisp, Saoirse Ronan's performance is sublime, and the story hews to the inextricable mix of tedium and drama that encapsulate one's senior year of high school.

I would say that all of the actors and actresses do a really nice job playing the roles they have been given. The hard part is that some of the characters are quite unlikeable. Lady Bird is just all over the place. She is self entitled, selfish, and just straight up weird. Saoirse Ronan is a great actress, but I often was taken out of scenes because she is clearly so much older than the role she is playing. I know 20 year olds routinely play high school kids, but something about her appearance makes her look even older. The movie also doesn't really have a plot. It is a good snapshot of what it is like to be Lady Bird. The movie just doesn't deserve the 9 and 10's critics have been giving it. I chalk that up to a couple factors. One is that Lady Bird is obsessed with New York and moving to where there is more \"culture.\" This feeds into the elitist mindset of many critics. The other is that the main character and the director are women.

It is dissimilar enough from the legions of others to the point where it becomes an exceptional film. It uses classic Oscar bait tactics like humor to build a strong relationship between that of the titular \"Christine\" and the viewer. Although a cheap way of doing, so the humor is never dry and most of the jokes hit as intended. The film is also a lovely diorama of the teenage experience; bringing up problems and insecurities that almost every teenager has experienced at some point. It is noticeably geared toward a female viewer, however; as a guy I could still draw parallels between shared experiences with the characters. Overall, this film is a sentimental and human journey through the senior year of a young girl. It may not have the exceptional grasp of realistic dialogue of a Baumbach film, and it may not have the cinematography of a Paul Thomas Anderson film, but it carries the same emotional punch as films such as the royal tanenbaums (without the sense of closure -- mild spoiler)"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Brilliantly captures that beautiful bubble of transition between dramatic teenage years and adult maturity, combined with a realistic and wrenching portrayal of complicated familial love."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Professionally made but not worth seeing.

I went with my mother, father, and one of my sisters and we all really enjoyed it which is certainly not always the case.I think that both the characterization and the acting were superb in making real characters. Nobody felt like a plot device and or straightforward. I can't even tell you who I think the best actor was because I truly think they all did a great job at capturing emotions in a realistic and captivating manner. The humor was not all that inventive, and most of the jokes have been done on sitcoms, but I laughed out loud. There are moments I will find something hilarious and I'll either try to make myself laugh or stay silent. That was not the case in Lady Bird. I was genuinely laughing and the rest of the audience was too.I think tonally, it's like The Way, Way Back but I admit I only saw a chunk of that movie on an airplane. So, if I'm totally off, I apologize. But, I found it to be a very realistic coming of age movie with very very real desires and actions of Lady Bird. I admit, this being marketed as Oscar Bait was what got me in the theatres but I do wonder if that is the way they should've gone with this movie because if more teens were exposed to this movie, I think they would love it.
