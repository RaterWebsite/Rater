      "text": "OK, I am from DC and a lot of people hate the Post's movie critic, myself included. He hates on everything because I guess he's jealous he doesn't work for the NY Times. I had no idea what moto GP was like before the film but I thought this was one of the best documentaries I've seen in a couple of years. I was completely blown away and VERY engaged with the characters. the DVD is GREAT over 4+ hours of extras on two discs, basically it's two movies and extras. Highly recommended!"
