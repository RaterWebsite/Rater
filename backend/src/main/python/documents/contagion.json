The movie had a good message, but it gets lost.  I have recommended to friends and family - save your money and wait for the DVD."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Unless you are a hypochondriac with a wild imagination of your own, this movie was a disaster.  The acting was fine, but the movie was slow moving and barely kept my attention.  It was Steven Soderbergh's sloppiest work to date.  I couldn't see any good reason to pay the extra money to see this in IMAX.  I thought there might be some amazing cell imagery or something to capture the attention and fascinate, but this was pathetic.  I go to the movies every week and this is the first time in my five years of consistent movie-going, that I was prompted to create one of these accounts and say something."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "The movie was oddly mellow for having the world suffer a highly fatal plague.  That is to say there were no intense situations or extraordinary circumstances that would transform a character into something beyond a small piece of the puzzle.  Each person had a small roll to play and none of them went beyond that.  There are two sides to that coin - on one hand, you had a disjointed story of various people and their outlooks on life, death, family and duty - on the other hand, you got to see a wide variety people's reactions in what could be a very really world phenomenon.  I didn't know how to feel coming out of the theater; the movie wasn't bad, but it wasn't great, hence a 7/10."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "I had much higher hopes for this movie, but it turned out to be a decent disaster movie, with some reflexion  on medical companies who could generate profit from these pandemics. I did not like how some characters acted totally un-realistical. When Kate Winslet's character tells that an average human touches his/her face thousands of times a day... What does she do next? Walking among infected people without wearing face or eye protection...Un-realistic...The other performances were all average, nothing outstanding. I can not really recommend this movie. It is nothing more than a great budget version of the same pandemic formula with the message that some pandemics might be created by medical companies to generate profit through their vaccines."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "This movie was a poor attempt at simulating the movie Outbreak. It was slow to begin with, with incoherent scenes and the characters were all dull. I'm not being biased either, as I find factual science and documentaries fascinating, so a mix of these two should have been great... but it wasn't. I'm also a big fan of Laurence Fishburne, but this role didn't do him any justice. How this got a better review from the critics than Machine Gun Preacher, I have no idea!"}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Slice of life (or in this case death). No significant plot just a plodding look at the progression of a pandemic. I wouldn't call that revelation a plot spoiler since the preview essentially tells the whole story at a glance.

Let's just say I'm glad I bought the matinee priced ticket for this one."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Contagion tells a decent, realistic story of... uh, contagion. It's fascinating on the scientific front but also rather cold and distant. Not to mention undramatic; the deaths of millions are seen from a very clinical, detached viewpoint. Still, it tells it's story effectively enough to scare you into using hand-soap more regularly."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Wasn't disappointing by any means, but is also not a must-see movie. Good acting, especially from the children, and an original musical score. But the movie left too much unanswered (and not in a sequel kind of way) and the climax was rather irrelevant to what the entire movie leads up to. Worth a see, but maybe wait until DVD.

I could easily recommend it to anyone interested in the subject, but it's the realism and the sober, analytic treatment of something abstract, that makes me almost give it top score. A perfect ten it isn't, at all. It's no classic and it's no milestone in film. But it's something very special, competently executed, and educational for the layman. If only everyone watched it, we might not touch our faces as much, and we might not create demand for pig slaughter. Let's get rational about sources of diseases. In the real world, the financial interests are not to be trusted, whether governmental or private. We can only ever ask of each other to act in wisdom."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "It's a fine movie but far too many characters and sub plots.

There is no horror, action or shock factor in this movie at all.

The dialogue wasn't very good, no great performances by a actor/actress.

Why were Matt Damon , Gwyneth Pattrow, Kate Winslet in the movie if they had no real part to play?   A virus gets out and is spread around the world by traveling people.    There has to be more to a story to make a movie than that.  I suspect the writer quit early on and the camara people and actors just sort of winged it from there.    For a moment we had hope that something would happen when the antibiotic was injected in people world wide --but alas--no werewolves developed-- no nothing.  People in the theatre could be heard softly muttering--don't tell me that 's it.  It's going to end!  Good grief did there was nothing.   The screen lit up --then a dragging lot of nothing and then it ends.   Just huh! well it was no \"I am Legend\".    SCore=0"}, {"rating": "1", "text": "This movie had great potential. It had a great lineup of cast members, and the doomsday senario is definately appealing to those who enjoy watching apocolyptic style movies. However this film failed to deliver the excitement that it portrayed in its previews. Overall the movie is downright boring to watch as it jumps around, and does not adiquately portray the level of emotion, panic, crime, and civil unrest that one would expect if the world was on the verge of a major collapse by a virus that originally had no treatment, no vaccine,  was easily spread by airborne and fluid transmition, and had a high casualty rate. The movie tended to jump around to various characters, and required the viewers immagination to come up with conclusions of how most of characters would end up at the end of the movie. Despite the cast, the acting was poor and most of the cast did not show much emotion. There were very few parts with action as most would expect fights with the military, civil disobedience, mass rioting, looting, and increased gang activity poping up. Most movies of this type have shown numerous sights of mass graves, body collection, and even bodies dead on the streets. You see fighting with government officials/ military personel, rioting, mass looting, and overall increased crime. The potential seriousness of the situation was never really brought out as it jumped around too much to other characters and did not give any character enough time to really develop a solid story line. Parts that seemed to intensify quickly went away and were forgoten about.  An example would be when Mitch Emhoff (played by Matt Daymon) is trying to get out of Minnesota into Wisconsin, but is blocked by U.S. military. He gets out of his car, argues with the solder for a few seconds and then gives up and gets in his car and turns around back into Minneapolis. No other attempts are made by his character to leave the area. He just goes home and thats it. Such a good law abiding citizen during times of crisis! (also extremely unrealistic)  Another moment is when Mitch Emhoff is looking at his neighbors house one night and hears gunshots within his neighbors house, he dials 911 and gets no response, nothing else happens (though one might expect somthing would happen, but it doesent) He goes over to his neighbors house only to find nothing, except that he finds a gun and takes it home only to set it by the front door. You never see anything else happen regarding the gun or an attempt of looters to break into his house. The movie just jumps to a different character.  By the end of the movie it does have an interesting ending of how the virus began, but otherwise it was a very dull movie that could have done so much more. What a waste of money. The best part of the movie was when I got to get up and leave the theater.\rFor those who think this movie was great, probably have not seen \"Outbreak\" or even Steven Kings \"The Stand\". Those doomsday senario movies are much better thought out, directed, and executed."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "this is a video review of the movie i found on you tube that i thought was interesting so take a look for yourselfhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngCQQvwsAZo"}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Contagion is about a group of people who must deal with the spread and containment of a highly contagious disease. Based on that statement you could probably guess what might happen. Sick people, a search for the cure, and widespread panic. Contagion is exactly what you think it is. Not to say that's bad, but I was not surprised by anything I saw.The disease starts in Hong Kong, from there it is carried by Gwyneth Paltrow back to the states where she and her son die within a day or so. Her husband Matt Damon, immune to the disease, is left to take care of himself and his daughter.Meanwhile Laurence Fishburne, Kate Winslet, Marion Cotillard, and a few other major players are notified of numerous deaths happening around the world. The disease is spreading quickly, and the Center for Disease Control must find a vaccination and keep the public calm.Jude Law a conspiracy blogger/journalist broke the story first. He questions if the CDC is really trying to help. He finds a medicine that he believes cures the disease, and spreads the word. As millions become affected chaos breaks out, road blocks are set up, and the people go nuts.Soderbergh directed an all star cast. Scott Burns wrote a fairly smart script. The movie was well put together and entertaining enough, but nothing more than you'd expect. I wish Soderbergh would have gotten a little more experimental, maybe tinted the movie red or something like he did with Traffic. It seems like disease outbreak movies can go in one of two directions. An epidemic occurs and everyone turns into flesh eating zombies Aka 28 days later & I am Legend. Or an epidemic probably stemming from an animal becomes widespread, and the government works to contain the disease and the world seemingly goes ape **** Aka Outbreak.I honestly felt like Contagion was too predictable and brought in tons of characters the movie couldn't devote enough time to explore. John Hawkes who I loved in Winter's Bone, plays a Janitor who shows up only once in each act of the movie, his character seemed compelling, but was pretty much wasted. The movie somewhat explored the idea that the government and CDC took care of their own before the average person. Hawkes character could have been used to show the struggles and desperation of a lower income individual taking care of his family during this epidemic.Winslet and Cotillard were intriguing as well, but are never really explored. They came and went without us really knowing anything about them. I completely forgot about Cotillard until they mildly tie up her story near the end. I think this movie could have benefited from chopping off some of the extra meat. There were probably 7 or 8 main characters introduced, and only 2 or 3 were given the proper time to develop. Contagion tried to be this massive story about all these different people, but it just couldn't be done in 100 minutes.For this movie to work, they were really gonna have to get us involved with these characters. So when they cry, we cry. When they are angry, we get angry, and so on. They basically just crapped on Matt Damon's character the whole movie, and by the end, sure I felt bad for him, but I wasn't really upset. His wife was cheating on him, he couldn't give his family a proper funeral, and he was stuck inside with no food protecting his daughter for months. I was more like, \"jesus christ\" cut this guy a break. You waited for some kind of reprieve, but what they gave him was pretty unsatisfying.On the positive side, I always say if I can finish a movie in one sitting it was pretty good. And like I said the cast was impressive. Matt Damon is a great actor and he did what he could with the wiggle room he was given. He had two key emotional scenes, hearing his wife has died and dealing with it at the end, both were good. Jude Law probably had the best overall part. They flipped him around so rapidly, you're never really sure of his motives. He was probably my favorite character.I really did like contagion, it just didn't add anything to the genre. If you're going to make a movie on a topic that's already been explored, you have to find a unique way to tell the story. This movie just rang repetition in my ears, and it'll quickly be forgotten.http://themoviehook.blogspot.com/"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Classic Soderbergh but at his best.  Thrilling and stressful.  Heavy and compelling and very believable.  Not over sciencey but enough to tie together a very realistic feeling and terrifying possibility.  Timely and touching.

It's a rather cerebral look at the worldwide spread of a lethal new virus: personal reactions and panic in the streets, while scientists attempt to find a cure.

It is about a topic that we do not care until it is all over the world, an epidemic. But the things that difference it from other biological thrillers are the unknown origin of the disease and the multiple perspectives of the development of the epidemic.The unknown beginning of the virus gives Contagion a sort of mysterious atmosphere, but also approaches more to reality, because in most of this situation the authorities notice the problem when there are a few amounts of death people and several others infected; so the only solution is to find a cure. And if you add to this a new form of transmit the virus and scientific bureaucracy; you got a promising and very scary picture.The multiple points of views, which is a signature characteristic of a contemporary production, gives the movie a sort of feeling of a vast reality that no one can hold; and this is simply what a virus can do to humankind.Contagion has a terrific idea, simple performances and some characteristics of documentary; but the development of the story it is absolutely predictable."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "First off, I would give it a 9.25 out of 10.

It wasn't a thriller, but it felt like it several times.  The main problem for me was that there wasn't a central character to focus on.  There were too many storylines.  Some of them were interesting, but not so much as too garner all the attention. It just kind of meandered all over the place.  Some stories play out, but others are left dangling in the wind.  The audience is supposed to surmise the character's fate.  The acting is top notch, but a similar (and better) movie is 1995's Outbreak, with Hoffman, Russo, and Freeman.

After the beginning, the movie just turns crap, there are like 5 stories happening at once which have no connection to each other, one of them including Kate Winslet dying of the virus which made no sense because Kate Winslet had no role in the movie except being shown in an abundance of abnoxious video montages filled with horrible music. By the end of the movie, you feel like you want your money back because nothing ever happened.

An epidemic sweeps across the world, and it is up to one man to save his family from the invisible threat. At least, this is what you can infer from the trailer. However, after viewing Contagion, I get more of a documentary sort of vibe from the film. No matter what turmoils may be occurring, Contagion always brings it back to the cold hard facts. The Science. Which is good, if you're into that sort of thing. However, it felt as if the characters were underdeveloped or swept under the rug as an afterthought. The entire film could have been an endless source of suspense and drama if only the director decided to stop playing teacher once in a while. And considering the brilliant cast, one would expect that this would be the case. This brings me to my next point: the camera. During the opening moments of Contagion (the scenes that I remember the most, I might add) there were several shots that were held for far too long. This problem was subtle, but it made the film feel like a middle school media project.

As the story progressed, you start to meet many types of people, some good and some bad. It is similar to most hero's tales, except the vilan is not just one person. The villan is a virus humans can't explain. It is like Darth Vader as little, tiny viruses that exist almost everywhere at once. There are people who want to be greedy and take advantage (who you could say are villans) and those who truly want to stop the virus (who you could say are the heros). Whatever you call these people, they are part of a story that affects more than a village, city, or state, but the entire human race. The plot was well thought out, and the characters developed well. It didn't, however, follow the predictable plot of most movies, since there was no climax or central vilan confrontation. Making a movie like this is hard, and even harder to do right.

Yes, there are a lot of plot lines to follow and some people are going to be disappointed that their favorite actor/actress doesn't play a bigger part in the movie.

For example, some have stated that the scenes with Jude Law's character seem like a diversion.  There's a point to that.  He may be the most important character in the movie.  I will stop short of offering a spoiler and just say that there are subtleties at work here that mimic the world we live in.  Pay attention!I lament that so many people watch this movie and say, as one reviewer has, that there is \"no real plot development.\"  Instead, this movie should be applauded because the plot development was real; i.e., realistic.

So for me the movie was good, it had a good story, good performances, and a good director."}], "recommendations": ["children_of_men", "what_happened_to_monday", "code_8", "the_hunger_games_mockingjay_part_1", "eo", "limitless", "chaos_walking", "stowaway", "elysium", "sanctum", "nerve", "the_grey", "the_counselor", "the_titan", "brimstone", "downsizing", "greenland", "colossal", "the_purge_anarchy", "sicario_day_of_the_soldado", "how_it_ends", "tenet", "the_butterfly_effect", "the_tomorrow_war", "the_gambler"]}
