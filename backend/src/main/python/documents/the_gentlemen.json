      "text": "Ritchie's return to the crime caper flicks that made him a household name is essentially what you expect. Well acted, talky, and a lot less smarter than it actually is. Its biggest weakness is that Ritchie has always tried to emulate Tarantino's style and his mixed up timeline, but never really getting it right. It took such a long time setting things up that I literally got bored on its first half. After that though, things started to move at a more brisk clip, with a pretty good finale to wrap things up. A good watch, but nothing new here."

      "text": "An extremely anemic attempt to bring back the success of Lock, Stock & Snatch. Anemic is actually an understatement. If you can make it through the first half hour without using your popcorn bag as a receptacle for the contents of your stomach, then you, like most of the viewing public at this point in the history of humanity, have lost all ability to discriminate...notice the difference between inspired creativity and a desperate formula. Matthew McConaughey is who he always is in every film, unwatchable. The script is supposed to be engrossing but it just doesn't deliver. It's like a train off the rails the entire time, plowing forward anyway, grating noise, going nowhere. The plot and dialogue are so utterly contrived and lame that I actually felt sorry for the actors, some of whom are quite talented, struggle to bring vitality to this total P.O.S. I can't even finish my review because it is making me ill to recall everything worth criticizing, suffice to say that this is more a public service announcement to not waste your time. It's really one of the worst films of this genre I have ever seen."

No chemistry or anything between the American gangster and his beloved moll wife.  There were fun moments but how did the Black London boxing guys become expert with automatic weapons, especially when Colin Farrell just told us they're his pupils at a boxing gym?  How did McConaughey survive a hhigh-speed crash with a lorry, with nary a scratch.  Why didn't someone in makeup shave that nasty rash of a beard off his face?  The opening credits were the best moment, it was trying to be Snatch but was typically Richie overdone."

      "text": "The Gentlemen is done dirty by a January opening. It's an April, at least. The movie is more of an experiment in ASMR sexual harassment on the part of some attractive no good doers from Ritchie's past projects. The story is a bit of a mousetrap of chronologies and unreliable narration, which makes it fun and tightly packed, well-paced, and oddly both more and less self-aware than some of his previous projects.I have a soft and blind spot for Guy Ritchie films. I don't usually know I'm watching one unless Charlie Hunnam is in it. I've passively consumed a lot of Ritchie's big budget films in my childhood and early adolescence. I am continually surprised by the ways that his aesthetic both parodies and plays along with some themes of toxic masculinity: the gestures toward gay- and race-baiting for humor, the way that self-aware British culture clashes with American sensibilities about masculinity, and the unexpected joy of a bro-y film that doesn't need to feel like a game of Cards Against Humanity with your edgelord friends from college. The Gentlemen is a who's who of Ritchie's oeuvre of caper and gangster flicks along with actors on the rise like Henry Golding and Michelle Dockery (of Downton fame), and Matthew McConnaughey saucily eye-fing the camera the entire movie. Spoilers ahead. Ritchie makes moves toward metatheatrical storytelling in his editing, his occasional illustrated captioning, an inset narrative, and the not-so-subtle parables wrapped in trailer material. The opening shot of this movie, in which McConnaughey dies, is startling, and the rewind and reconstruction of events, which has the room for embellishment and authorial focalization, are elements of novel direction, but there are other things that are less innovative, notably the rape threat, which amounts to maybe the biggest missed opportunity for a rewind. One cannot help but think of moments like these as unforced errors. It's not our job to explain away the sloppiness of these choices for \"time\" or \"movie length,\" because when you're movie has a full on music video of fight porn, you lose the excuse of having trimmed the plot to its barest bones. It can't be fun to be the critic finger wagging at the twee racist jokes of a much beloved genre director of dark comedies. I expect that everyone's sensitivities will be tested at some point or another in this movie, but I'm personally a lot less guilty about laughing at the casually racist jokes in this movie than I am about the constant undercurrent of faux homosexual tension that's pervasive in this movie. If this is a directorial decision that's supposed to satirize the BDE of the genre heroes, I am open in being persuaded to like it. In terms of fun ways that Ritchie defuses my anxieties about racist accents and the rest: the movement of our sympathies from the first time we meet The Toddlers and their original entry versus the final scenes or the Three Strikes joke (I'm reading this in my notes, I don't know what these means anymore) shows how Ritchie can play on our expectations of what a Bro-y movie with a lot of Anglo strongmen would think about a bunch of black and brown tykes with GoPros strapped to their heads. Even the way that Colin Ferrell educates the kids in the shop is an excellent twist to his own character, because it feels like he's toying with some inner city hooligans, in part, to deflate their egos, but we then learn that this is sort of his whole deal. The way Ferrell responds to his Toddlers when they ask, \"Is everything OK, Coach?\" with \"No, it's not fine\" and admonishment for their past actions does a lovely job of injecting their relationship with the pathos of a mentor. I guess there's some insidious racism implicit in the idea that the only thing standing between these boys and crime is a rough tongued Irishman, but honestly the conversation on race that the Coach and his student have does enough to show that the film is at least aware of criticism. Laugh out loud moments in this movie were reserved for the dragon fable and it\u2019s rewind--Wife and Friend were both tickled by it and Wife went in unaware of the trailer, so I think it was doubly funny for her. The rewinds on Dry Eye's introduction are a way of being able to build character for the narrator and create a sense that our story is unreliable. The way that the inset narrative eventually leads to the present moment of storytelling is an excellent control of plot. The foiling of blackmail and new relationships that are blended together post the journalist's initial run through of the story makes for a powerful second act. I like the twisty chronology of the beginning moment of the McConnaughey's murder and the way that Hugh Grant's twist with the Russian oligarch changes the trajectory of the story. Might have to think on this one a little harder, but I definitely recommend."

      "text": "Nothing too unexpected here, but it's funny and hugely entertainingThe Gentlemen is a return to the London gangster milieu where writer/director Guy Ritchie first made his name with films such as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and snatch. (2000). And yes, the film seems stuck in the last decade in more ways than one, it's highly questionable that the only gay character is a slimy man-whore into S&M, its only female character barely even manages to rise to the level of tokenism, and Ritchie does absolutely nothing new here, but The Gentlemen is still hugely entertaining. Most of the jokes land, the dialogue is as sharp and expletive-laden as ever, the cast are having a ball, and the self-reflexivity works well for the most part. The plot is as derivative as it gets, but Ritchie has injected real verve into it. The Gentlemen won't change your life, but it will make you laugh.The film begins as sleazy private eye Fletcher (Hugh Grant) arrives unannounced at the home of Ray (Charlie Hunnam), right-hand man to Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), an Oxford-educated American ex-pat who controls a huge marijuana empire in London. Several months prior, Fletcher was hired by tabloid editor Big Dave (Eddie Marsen) to dig up dirt on Pearson, and Fletcher has written a screenplay based on his investigation, telling Ray that unless Pearson pays him \u00a320 million, he will hand over everything he has to Dave. Meanwhile, Pearson has decided to sell his whole operation, but when word gets out, all hell breaks loose, as the various interested parties vie for advantage. Most of the subsequent film takes the form of Fletcher narrating his exploits to Ray, explaining how he learned so much about Pearson and what he does.Aesthetically, The Gentlemen is very much in the mould of Ritchie's previous gangster movies. Because Fletcher frames his narration as a screenplay, it allows Ritchie to employ a multitude of self-reflexive devices \u2013 a smash cut coinciding with Fletcher asking Ray to visualise a smash cut; on-screen captions telling us who's who; animated maps; freeze-frames; rewinds; a shot of film running through a projector etc. At one point, Fletcher is discussing the merits of anamorphic over 1.78:1, and the film's aspect ratio changes accordingly. At another, he's arguing for the merits of 35mm celluloid over digital, and the film duly switches formats. Such playfulness means that it never for a second takes itself too seriously, and it remains immensely fun, with the more you know about the mechanics of assembling a film, the more humorously self-reflexive the film becomes \u2013 Fletcher even acknowledges his own role as an unreliable narrator.In terms of themes, the most obvious is the idea that the economic divide between gangsters and aristocrats masks their practical similarities. The smooth running of Pearson's business depends on both classes \u2013 the aristocrats who he needs to grow his product and the gangsters who distribute that product. The clash between the pompous insularity of the English upper class and the perceived uncouthness of the lower class has been done to death in both literature (Wuthering Heights (1847) springs to mind) and film (Performance, for example), and although Ritchie doesn't say anything even remotely new about it, it still forms an interesting textural background \u2013 gentrification is ever-present; there are ironic references to the posh areas of Croydon; Ray, a working-class Newcastle native, is a cleanliness freak who eats wagyu steak and lives in a mansion, and when he's dispatched on a mission to an uncivilised working-class area, he explains he \"just hates them junkies,\" seeing them as very much his social inferiors.One of the most central scenes sees Ray and his mn clash with a gang of machete-wielding thugs on a council estate, and there's a real sense of old vs. new \u2013 traditional gangsters fighting it out with internet-savvy hoodlums who don't give a damn about tradition or respect. There are a lot of laughs to be had with these issues, such as Ray and Coach (a scene-stealing Colin Farrell) having problems pronouncing the name Phuc. And again, none of this is presented as even remotely serious.The biggest problems with the film are probably its lack of depth, and the familiarity of the presentation, characters, and milieu \u2013 there's nothing here you haven't seen in previous Ritchie films. And as you would expect, there isn't much in the way of emotional maturity or narrative complexity. It's all very surface-level, and it makes no apologies for such.Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed The Gentlemen. It's a funny as hell caper and the actors are clearly having terrific fun. It might be formulaic and overly familiar, but it's also immensely enjoyable."

I don't know if this film fit his style or if it was like any of his other films. One thing I do know though, is that it was a real fun time. Each character had a charisma to them and were enjoyable in their own way. It felt like the the world and background of the film and characters was always moving and growing, with each character having their own job or role.It doesn't fail at delivering laughs when needed either. Overall, it's a good time."

      "text": "A fun return to the British gangster film by Guy Ritchie that is not unlike Snatch and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels although never quite achieves the same light. The movie is well written and stylishly shot with a web-tangle story that comedically unfolds through Hugh Grant's wonderful narration to Charlie Hunnam's mild amusement and annoyance. Matthew McConaughey stars as the king of the streets and delivers a great performance that demands the screen like no other as they twist and turn through the mystery of the story. The pace tends to slow a bit but is never boring due to the writing and sheer madness of the characters we meet throughout. Standouts like Grant and Colin Farrell elevate the material they are given and Hunnam's straight man performance is enough to have fun when he finally does get involved in the violent chaos of the movie."

      "text": "Now, this wasn't an artistically great movie, but I would consider it to be a rather enjoyable one. Matthew McConaughey was highly convincing in the part, with a brilliant supporting cast that is really able to sell their roles and the accompanying banter. I would say that it's definitely not for everyone - it is something of a gangster movie - but still amounts to something like a crime comedy, which Guy Ritchie is naturally good at. It isn't something that absolutely needs to be seen immediately in the theater, for sure, but it definitely is one to catch at some point for people into movies."

You do need to concentrate but the pieces all come together well at the end.  We ended up taking about this the next day, which is always a good sign."

Ofcourse it's the White, Anglo gangsters that are the more ethical, honourable and competent ones, that come out on top because of plot armour and other rubbish. The users reviews seem to be spamming people with downvotes who didn't like this film for being crass and bigoted towards anyone that wasn't white or Anglo in this film and I can kindly tell those users to go **** them selves ;) Critics should've actually been more harsh."

Because god forbid a little REALISTIC humour that actually does exist in the real world. Because god forbid the men out number the women in the movie just like in the REAL world of crime. The left live in their little world of social media and want to make you believe that is how the real world should be like. But i continue to drink their delicious soyboy tears.  Guy Ritchie is back. The demonic hollywood can kick rocks. This movie is a gem. 4 more years."
