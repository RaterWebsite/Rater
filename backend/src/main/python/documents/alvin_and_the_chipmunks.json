Don't expect ground-breaking work, because this certainly isn't it, but it's a well meaning attempt to pay tribute to Alvin and the Chipmunks series, and succeeds in being just that. The plot is predictable and there's no serious depth, but if you go in with the right state of mind it makes for a heart-warming piece of escapism."

Sure, it sticks to the same kid-friendly formula as many similar films, and it might annoy a few people, but it's got some occasionally funny moments, some pretty great music and some good animation in regards to the characters. Obviously, this is one of those films that kids will enjoy more than parents, and I don't think it's worth repeat viewings, but all in all, \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" isn't an awful film at all. Just keep your expectations in check, and make sure to watch it with the kids, if you want to get the full enjoyment out of this one."

It successfully replicates and in some ways improves the sole charms of the characters with the kiddish mischief sure to entertain kids. This is also a very good animation effort!\rThere is sweetness here. The scene in which Dave and the boys decorate the tree is charming, and the Chipmunks' excited presentation of gifts to their human dad is actually sort of touching. And dang it, the little animated rodents are cute."

One of the best films that were released in 2007.\r7.   Great acting.\r8.   Humorous scenes.\r9.   Heartwarming moments.\r10. Great sequels.\r I recommend this film to anyone who has a young relative (baby, little brother/sister, little nephew/niece or grandson/granddaughter etc...) or anyone who enjoys a good cartoon because it is a great cartoon which you can buy from any dvd store (Blockbuster) or online store (Amazon, eBay or Play.com).\r So why are you still reading this you should be on a different website or on your way to a dvd store now. Go on GO!!!!!\r By ImogenDulieu987"

The acting was horrible --even more than the atrocious script-- and eventually the chipmunks got annoying to put up with anymore. I have to admit that the movie started out pretty good though, and that's the reason for the 3 instead of 0 stars. Also, I can't get the sound of Jason Lee screaming \"ALVIN!\" out of my head, because that's about the only line from the movie that you will remember."

The three main characters are devoid of personality, and while they may win over the kiddies, they will most likely annoy adults. Jason Lee meanwhile, looks depressed to even be in the movie, and it's not hard to see why. The only funny part of the movie is David Cross, who brings much more energy to the picture than it deserves. So why did I give it a five and not a two, I hear you ask? Because the beginning does have its moments. That, and I'm feeling generous. Overall, it may please young children, but Alvin and the Chipmunks will do little for their parents, and fans of the original cartoon looking for nostalgia will probably feel cheated."

The characters were two-demensional, the man playing dave (whom I can't recall the name) made me wince whenever he yelled \"ALVIN\". Oh, and the chipmunks' voices while inevitably charming were sometime a little difficult to understand, but were bearable. The storyline was predictable. Really this isn't the kind of movie you would watch if you were say 13+ but if you did anyway, it probably didn't wow you. But in praise to this movie, kids will like it, it's a good family movie and it's a passable alternative to other pieces of garbage. But if you are looking for a spectacular, worldly-acclaimed children's movie that also reaches to a broader audience, try Ratatouille."

David Cross is especially funny. What impressed me most though was the refreshing sight of normal-sized women in the Chipmunk's band (no size zeros here), and the movie also features actors *shock horror* with less than ridiculously perfect teeth, all of which can only send out positive messages to the children. The film also held my three year old's undivided attention for an hour an a half (no mean feat). And most importantly, her verdict is,and I quote: \"It was great!\""
