I was expecting a lot based on the really high rotten tomatoes score, at one point it was at 100%. It is really something you never seen before because it's an animated movie. However this movie is creative, dark, silly, fun, entertaining, touching, scary, and even surprising at times. The plot was very well constructed and it really does give a great message to everyone. It's also very creative at times and something's were mindblowing. However, I think the biggest win for the film is its humor. If you've seen the trailer, you'd probably know what I'm talking about. However, there's a lot more throughout the movie, espicially the ending. All the voices also fitted perfectly and the film was also very touching, and sad. I think this film should at least deserve an oscar nomination for best animated film. I really think this is one of the very best disney films out there and it is certainly the best animated film of the year. I even enjoyed this more than inside out!\r(Fingers crossed on Finding Dory). (100/100)"

Seems like it tried too hard to go to deep with its concept and misses the opportunity to better motivate and flesh out the secondary characters.... That being said, you'd have to be having a bad day not to enjoy watching this one with your kids!"

Also, it's beautifully animated and the talented cast voices suit their characters perfectly. It has a plenty of funny scenes which we didn't watch before in any animated movie or even a live-action movie. This movie is like a comedy-adventure-action-crime movie and despite that it never made the viewers feel confused while watching it. The characters are definitely the most complicated characters I've ever seen in an animated movie, each character has its own point of view due to the experiences they get through and that makes each character has different motives and feelings.(10/10)"

Que equivocado que estaba! Los dos personajes principales (Nick Wilde y Judy Hopps) me encantaron, fueron las estrellas de la pel\u00edcula, contando con una gran relaci\u00f3n afectiva que se va desarrollando poco a poco mientras progresa la trama, carisma y un dise\u00f1o que me gusta bastante, ya que es muy \"cute\". Sin embargo, el resto de los personajes a nivel de dise\u00f1o es algo gen\u00e9rico, y el final deja que desear, ya que la antagonista principal: Bellwether nunca se revelan sus verdaderas intenciones de manera explicita. Todo eso de la operaci\u00f3n montada que se revela al final de la pel\u00edcula no parece tener mucho sentido. Hay una teor\u00eda que dice que ella lo hizo por venganza por ser maltratada de ni\u00f1a por los depredadores, y que ella quer\u00eda deshacerse de ellos para siempre de Zootopia, pero eso no es canon al no ser oficial, es simplemente una teor\u00eda. Una teor\u00eda por fans. De todas formas, Zootopia me gusto bastante, con una trama muy original (innovadora) y eso en pel\u00edculas animadas, es raro y es digno de verse. El potencial estaba ah\u00ed, depredadores y presas conviviendo en un mismo mundo... La recomiendo."

      "text": "Zootopia is fine. It's not a masterpiece, nor a terrible movie, it's not obnoxious and annoying like an Illumination movie by any means, but it's far from Disney's best work. I will not deny that Zootopia, the city, actually feels like another character. It is filled with creative concepts and ideas. The animation is great, as expected from Disney and the characters are filled with tons of personality thanks to creative character design. They aren't cute for the sake of being cute nor look like generic animal characters like some other animated movie with cute animals that came out the same year (CofcofSingcofcof) and the story actually takes advantage of the fact that they are animals. Also, this is a really funny movie. I always have a blast with this movie everytime I watch it, there are so many genuinely funny moments that I really enjoyed. Nick and Judy, the main characters, have a great dynamic, and are so fun to watch together. For the most part it is well written...For the most part, I said. My problems with this movie are with the script. The social commentary and the racism allegories are soooo on the nose and obvious, you might think that \"it's okay because it's a kids movie\", but I disagree, because there are kids movies with subtle social commentary and parallels to the real world, like Chicken Run, I mean it's not like they had a character explain to the audience that they are in a concentration camp or something, and that is how Zootopia feels. It gets so on the nose at one point that it becomes cheesy instead of shocking. I was also not a really big fan of some obvious furry pandering stuff, like the animal nudist club scene or the weirdly sensual dancing tigers at the dancing number at the end, those moments were awkward...Speaking about that, I hated the ending, it was so cringeworthy. It ended great but no...They needed a dance scene, because that is DEFINETLY not an animated kids movie clich\u00e9!Overall, I don't hate this movie. It's pretty good actually, but definetly not a great movie. I agree with people that say that it didn't deserve the Oscar, it should've gone to Moana, which is a far superior film in almost every aspect. Regardless, Zootopia is one of the better modern Disney films, I mean, at least it's better than Frozen, Big Hero 6 and Ralph Breaks the Internet"

      "text": "To begin with, Zootopia/Zootropolis is really a great movie. It tackles a large number of social issues (racism, bullying, prejudice, sexism, inequality, stereotyping, etc.). Zootopia's world is inhabited by two main groups of mammals: predators and preys. The beautiful thing about this movie is that it depicts racism and prejudice in a very \"equal\" way: predators and preys do not correspond to any human race existing on this planet. The directors and the staff have been very sensitive and clever in my opinion for doing that. It gives the movie a sense of universality. This movie is plenty of details, references, puns, etc. It is definitely very funny, entertaining and the computer graphics are just stunning. The movie also has sad/emotional scenes and that makes you feel empathy towards the main characters, Judy and Nick (who are simply AMAZING), but they also help create a bond between them. The message at the end of this film also had a huge impact on me. It may sound clich\u00e9 but it is definitely beautiful and praiseworthy. One last thing, I highly highly highly recommend this movie to both kids and (especially) adults (but also teenagers XD)!"

The characters were plain at best and the comedy often fell flat or was cringe inducing at the worst of scenes. The movie hardly deserved the praise it received from the public for being \"a kids movie tackling important societal issues\", when it shouldn't have relied on being political to be a good kids movie. The only positive thing about this film is its well done CGI. That's it."

Tras cumplir con el arduo labor de graduarse se muda a la gran ciudad donde descubre que las cosas no son tan favorecedoras para un peque\u00f1o mam\u00edfero, con compa\u00f1eros que no la toman en serio y trabajos sin reconocimiento. Con hambre de hacer algo significativo decide actuar fuera de la palabra su superior y se involucra en un caso de secuestros, donde su \u00fanica pista y ayuda es el zorro, Nick Wilde.\rDe ah\u00ed la pel\u00edcula se transforma en un interesante misterio con muchas sorpresas y giros argumentales, en general la pel\u00edcula es atrapante ya sea por los grandes detalles que tiene la animaci\u00f3n, el encanto y el humor de los personajes o la intrigante misi\u00f3n. Lo m\u00e1s destacable es el mensaje de tolerancia y aceptaci\u00f3n, en cada momento la pel\u00edcula muestra ejemplos de intolerancia donde uno puede verlo desde un punto vista m\u00e1s neutral ya que los animales no se clasifican por un color, creencia o g\u00e9nero.\rLes recomiendo totalmente esta pel\u00edcula a quien no la haya visto, es entretenida, colorida y sobretodo innova en lo que quiere decir."

Times in theaters was that the movie wasn't just trying to be a family movie but a family movie that children and adults could enjoy all round, while trying to make a impact on you with displaying some modern issues with the modern world, and after the research i found just how hard it was to make and create a story out of ideas the people at Disney who worked so hard to create a master piece with actual characters i could care about, a story which is thrilling to watch, and a expanisve world that feels like you could immerse yourself in imagining the possibilities, and  has some much potential for more, compared to another world like for example Frozen: Once the story was over and you start to think about it there not very much left in the world that they could 'go' from, While Zootopia on the other hand has so much left in the world where, heck they could literally make a TV series, or possibly another movie, (which fans of the movie would Love), and the possibilities of the World of Zootopia just continues, if the main protagonist get boring (Nick And Judy, which i highly doubt, just go look at he fan-fic archive that place is booming) then they could switch the protagonist , So the possibilities are just endless, so in the end, I loved the movie, so much i decided to take 35-40 minutes of my life (slow type even though i'm on he computer like 5 times week for like three-five hours, weird) that I'll never get back to write a review just to rate, show how i care about the movie, and further more just recommend, if you haven't seen this, I ask you to go and watch this, and if you don't just leave midway of the movie, word of advice, if you leave during the movie but not near the end most theaters will give you your money back or a free movie pass, how i know....*Cough, Dawn Of Justice.

Beautiful visuals, a fantastic cast, and a modern tale about prejudice all combine into what has become my favorite Disney film of the past 14 years.  There are hidden gems of adult humor, references to popular entertainment, and current events throughout.  It's a film that's as much for adults as it is kids, and will appeal to a very wide audience.\r The plot is a story we've heard before, but told supremely well.  It hits very close to home for anyone who's been a victim of prejudice, and serves as a powerful reminder that even if you think you aren't prejudiced, you still might be.  Yet despite the film's serious \"message\" it's not delivered in a ham-handed or overbearing way.  It's interwoven into a story about acknowledging your limitations, and trying to overcome them anyway, despite what others might say.\r My only complaint is actually a hidden compliment:\rThe world of Zootopia and its characters is so unbelievably well-constructed and vibrant that we can't help but want more of it.  The movie's short runtime doesn't allow the deep exploration of the side characters and environments that I desperately crave after seeing it.  There's a massive amount of sub-plots and tantalizing details we don't get a chance to delve into, which makes me a bit sad.  However, the polished end result is so fantastic that I can hardly use it as a true \"negative\".\r Hands-down, this is Disney's best animated film since \"Lilo and Stitch\" and deserves high praise.

What this film does better than any other Disney film is that it touches on a lot of serious subjects like racism, drugs, black markets, etc.  However, it combines that with hilarious writing and  lovable characters in Nick and Judy.  Honestly, I can't think of anything Zootopia did wrong.  Sure, I have a few complaints here and there, but overall, this movie is not only one of the best movies of 2016 so far, it may be one of my favorite Disney films ever made.  Whether you're a kid, teenager, or an adult, you need to see this movie, it really is that good.\r Zootopia gets a 10/10."
