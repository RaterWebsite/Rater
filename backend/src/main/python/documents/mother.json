The movie is the product of drug-fueled, idle egoism. We get it Donnie Darko. If this was his first movie: maybe. But that fact that this came out of an established individual means this is basically all he's got to give creatively. It's not just that the points he's trying to make aren't that interesting or impactful. Its couple with the fact that the movie just isn't filmed or edited all that well. There is no dynamic blocking and loads of sloppy post processing. The movie plays like a comic book and it is not a stylistic choice.Jennifer Lawrence can't act."

I fall into the latter camp, and only went to see the movie out of morbid curiosity to see what all the fuss is about. All I can say is I wish I hadn't bothered. The word 'pretentious' has been used a lot and it's fitting. If there's any justice, Aronofsky shouldn't be let near a movie set again."

I even liked parts of \"Requiem for a Dream\" and \"Black Swan.\" It is sad when you compare the likes of \"Mother!\" to these other films.The only thing shocking about \"Mother!\" is how bland it is. You know when you get a joke but you still don't find it funny? Well, I understood the message and allegory of \"Mother!\" but didn't find it interesting or thought provoking in any way at all. The film is so bad that it doesn't even deserve to be called pretentious because that would imply an ounce of ambition or vision on the directors part. It doesn't help that \"Mother!\" has the subtlety of a ten ton hammer and doesn't even add an original spin on its retelling of the bible.Some movies are too smart for their audiences and don't deserve the hatred they receive. \"Mother!\" is not one of them. It is the art-house equivalent of a Transformers film. It deserves to be hated and it deserves to fail. Only gets a 2/10 because I generally like the director."

It was a captivating, dark, cynical story about love that truly left me unsettled and in awe for hours after I'd seen it. Jennifer Lawrence gives a strong performance in the leading role, and Aronofsky's direction puts us right in her shoes as we experience every step of her intense journey. It's sure to piss of a lot of casual filmgoers and it's not for the faint-hearted, but as someone who loves film and appreciates directors that try new things, Mother! is my favourite film of the year so far, followed by It Comes At Night and Dunkirk"

The religious/mother nature allegory within the film was completely unexpected but welcomed with its beautiful execution. In a way, Mother! reminds me of the creepy, unsettling nature of Kubrick's 'The Shining', focusing on the characters and the environment in which they live as a means of building tension and suspense... Definitely one of the most intense movies I've ever had the pleasure of seeing."

Starring Jennifer Lawrence, Javier Bardem, Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer, this film isn\u2019t worthy of the time it takes to write this review except that, by giving an honest summary of it, others will hopefully be dissuaded from going to see it and that I will consider my good deed for the week. It\u2019s difficult to characterize this movie without using such adjectives as insane, unrealistic, absurd and mostly acts of exreme overkill and violence. Much like some modern art pieces, there are some misguided folks who may see allegories and analogies to life in this cinematic disaster but for this viewer, at least, I saw nothing more than ridiculous manifestations of bad writing and directing with supposed horror scenes so bad that, instead of being fear provoking, made them almost laughable. It would have been funnier had I not wasted an evening watching the movie instead of some bad television at home. I give this poorly executed effort by Mr. Aronofsky a one rating, and that goes solely to Ms. Lawrence\u2019s efforts on the film\u2019s behalf. Simply stated this is the \u201cMother\u201d of bad movies\u201d and deserves your firm boycott of this insult to the viewing audience."

It\u2019s so weird and highly controversial, you can\u2019t not see it. It\u2019s Darren Aronofsky so go see Mother! Why not? Well I\u2019ll tell you why not. I like weird and I\u2019d like to think I can tolerate a bit of controversy but damn, even I have a limit. I don\u2019t think I will ever be able to adequately describe how truly terrible Mother! is but I\u2019ll give it my best shot.It\u2019s not that Mother! offended me, or shocked me. I\u2019ve seen far more shocking scenes in movies (looking at you Martyrs) but Mother! has no plot, no narrative, no music, the cinematography doesn\u2019t exist, and the cameraman forgot how to zoom out. There is no sign of any direction. Seriously if this didn\u2019t have Aronofsky\u2019s name on it I doubt it would have even got a cinema release. But wait there\u2019s more, Jennifer Lawrence is giving the worst performance of her career. There\u2019s no script. There is nothing good about Mother! So Darren Aronofsky if your sole goal was to get a reaction well then you\u2019ve sure done it. But a movie so lazy and tiresome comes at a cost. I\u2019ve lost all respect for you as a director and your name means nothing anymore. The only reason I didn\u2019t walk out was the desperate hope that it will eventually get good. I wouldn\u2019t want to walk out only to miss the point, the dramatic conclusion. I\u2019ve watched this much I have to see it through right? Well as I\u2019ve sat through all 121 minutes and without giving away spoilers (not that I could even if I wanted to) I can safely say this movie is not worth sitting through. So don\u2019t go see Mother! It doesn\u2019t deserve your time or your money. I\u2019ve told you to skip Mother! but if you decide the curiosity will get the better of you then best of luck, just remember you can\u2019t un-watch it! Ever! I don't often give zero ratings but Mother! definitely deserves it."

It cannot be horror as the trailer presented it but it's a clear criticism of the religion and the impact that humans have on the planet earth. We need to celebrate this kind of risk that only a few amount of directors are taking to elevate the cinema. Aronofsky is a director, who gave us brilliant films like requiem for a dream and black swan, and with mother! he doesn't disappoint. Lawrence performance is good (excellent choice of casting), all the members of the crew and all the elements involved in this movie, make it a masterpiece"

      "text": "This is a relatively frenetic film, with lots of shaky camerawork, quite fast paced scenes of initially domesticity but then something goes wrong. Jennifer Lawrence I thought did quite well as the clearly anxious wife, very much sensing things are going to go badly wrong and having to deal with the situation she finds herself in. This is less of a jumpscare heavy sort of a horror film and more of a slightly spooky film with a heavy emphasis on symbols and how you interpret things. There is a fair bit of blood shown across some scenes, so be aware of that. There's also some hushed dialogue which was a bit hard to follow in full, which may frustrate some. I'd say its fairly atmospheric. The tone of voice of some of the male characters is definitely...frustrating and borderline creepy possibly. I imagine a lot of women could relate to the feeling of loss of control, loss of space and privacy that's portrayed in this film. Javier Bardem also gives a pretty decent performance in this claustrophobic film. It won't be a film that will appeal to all and I felt it seemed a bit ludicrous when pace wise it headed towards the last quarter or so but overall its relatively good for what it is, so I suppose I would recommend it, yes."

Although I can see many cannot comprehend it, for myself it was obvious the film is a comprehensive allegory for the bible, and poses as what I believe is an anti religion stance. While some say it is a chaotic movie with no direction, when relating scenarios to the bible, it all falls into place. \"Him\" is God, he creates beautiful work, and brings in worshippers and disciples. The two guests in the beginning are Adam and Eve. You can see as \"God\" directs them not to touch the glass figure, \"Eve\" does anyway and drops it. \"God\" banishes them from the study- or Eden - and the guests hurry out. Then, we can see two brothers - Cain and Able - fight for space in the will. This can be related to Cain's birthright, which he kills Able for and flees, just as the Eldest son kills his brother and flees. All throughout the film, each act corresponds with the biblical timeline and of course ends in Armageddon or the apocalypse, and \"god\" is all alone with his mediocre creation destroyed because of his need for admiration. This movie is made is a commentary on how if god is in fact real, his actions show that his love for worshippers is artificial, and the only genuine love he has is for the praise he gets."

It became a non-sensical, chaotic mess. People around me were laughing, and I couldn't criticise them for it! It's a real shame because the cast as a whole is quite good, although Jennifer Lawrence has the same gormless expression throughout. I think Aronofsky tried to be a little too intellectual with this. It felt very self-indulgent and egotistical as a piece of work. It's definitely unnerving but also frustrating and confusing which doesn't make it an easy watch by any means. At the same time, it's overwrought with religious allegory and moral overtones. Honestly, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone except for sheer curiosity.

It is trying so hard to be shocking it makes me sick. I will never watch this movie again and am thinking twice about watching anything Darren Aronofsky is a part of."

Half the time we're just following \"mother\" walk around the house, while the rest of the film is a total confusion bust if you don't know a thing about Genesis (which they totally screwed over). But hey, atheists will continue making movies on what they don't really know about I guess."

      "text": "Worst. Houseguests. EVER.I spent the majority of the movie in a state of perpetual confusion. It's a challenging piece of cinema and in more ways than one. The content can be downright horrifying and it in no way holds your hand when trying to decipher what all of it means. It proves that Darren Aronofsky is not just a filmmaker, but an artist. As problematic as mother! can be, I appreciate him for creating something so provocative.The reason the film is so divisive is because it can be interpreted in a myriad of different ways. Everything is very symbolic. It's also an extremely harsh movie. It's graphic content is both the intelligent, mature work of a tortured soul and the profane temper tantrum of a petulant child. Pretentious, puerile, and poignant.By the time the movie ended I had already changed my interpretation of it several times before forming my own conclusion. Of course I did end up looking up what the film is actually supposed to be about (I just had to know) and found out I was totally wrong. I had picked up on some of the symbolism, but walked away with something totally different for the final message. I don't feel discouraged by this though. I like that it spoke to me in it's own way. That's what makes it good. You may not enjoy mother!. Could end up walking away thinking it's nothing more than a bunch of pretentious, vulgar trash. But at least it will make you feel something and in a way that only art can."

I liked Noah a lot though, and I'm not a Christian. Honestly, I think the character of the artist is Darren Aronofsky. Either this man is psychologically amoral, or he is just plain immoral. What I mean by that is that it looks like this is a work of art \"for the sake of art\", which uses women to shock."

      "text": "Trigger Warning\"You never loved me. You only loved how I loved you.\" ---mother (Jennifer Lawrence) to Him (Javier Bardem)Directed by Darren Aronofsky (\"Black Swan\" and \"Requiem for a Dream\") \"mother!\" is possibly the darkest, most disturbing movie I have ever seen.It is absolutely one of the most affecting.Reviews have been mixed, to put it nicely. But I think the theme of \"mother!\" terrifies some people so much that they choose to be perplexed by it rather than allow themselves to even think about what Aronofsky is suggesting.My take on the film is that it is about God, humans, and our respective relationships with creation and the creative process.Humans are trying to create Heaven on Earth, and God is....well....God created our ability to create. \"mother!\" is about the futility of OUR attempts.It is about nihilism.It is the abyss, looking back at us.Congratulations to Darren Aronofsky: He got it on film."
