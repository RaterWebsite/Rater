However, The story is an absolute mess. The lack of chemistry between Cruise and McGillis is quite obvious and the romance subplot really doesn't blend well with the main story. It honestly felt like I was watching clips the entire time rather than experience a cohesive story.I can understand the cult following that it has but the critics were right. This movie is kind of eh."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Top Gun had a story which had a lot of potential. The plot is as cheesy as any movie. After you watch the movie for a while, the story will fade but the feel and the mode of the movie is what keeps you interacted. The soundtrack was nice and aircraft scenes were nicely shot. The negative thing about the movie was it's story. It was too simple and over-stretched. It could have been made much better. This is movie which you may enjoy at cinema but not that at home. Overall, you should give this movie a try especially those who love airforce."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Out of all the films that came out in 1986, why was Top Gun the most popular? Regardless of my own personal opinion of the film (which is quite obviously a low one), I kind of understand the draw. If I had reviewed Top Gun at the time it came out I would have probably been taken aback by the stunning aerial cinematography done during the dogfights. At the time I would have praised the film much more heavily than I am now due to our current ability to do these shots with much more ease than we had before. The film was impressive due to the limitations of the time. A factor that would move it up to a one out of 10 for me if that was all I liked about the film. I have to admit that the film's soundtrack is, for the most part, well done with suiting music for each scene. Kenny Loggins provides the film's main theme with the song \"Danger Zone\" (which would later rise to fame again through the animated show \"Archer\"). But this is where my praise for Top Gun ends.Top Gun is a terrible film when watched as anything other than a two-hour-long advertisement for the US Military, more specifically the air force. The script is a male power fantasy that over-glorifies war. It portrays all women as emotionally weaker than men, even those that hold positions of power over men. Maverick got the girl by not taking no for an answer and being over-confident in himself. The script was terrible to the point where I started laughing halfway through the film because of how forced some of the lines were. There was an overly forced romance between Maverick and his instructor while most of the chemistry was focused on Maverick and Goose to the point where they play what I can only describe as a porn song over a serious scene of the two talking. I thought they were going to get it on because the moment seemed so right for it to happen.There are better military films. There are better military academy films. And there are better actions films. The only reason I'd suggest watching the film is to see what a hilariously terrible blunder it was in the careers of all three Tom Cruise, Val Kilmer, and Tim Robbins"}, {"rating": "3", "text": "boring sappy frustrated gay movie that doubles as a recruitment ad for the Airforce.

Intense action scenes, and in between great brotherhood between Goose and Maverick. (RIP Goose)"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "My all time favorite movie. Amazing acting by Tom Cruice and rest of the crew. Story is great and for sure, this movie is underrated"}, {"rating": "4", "text": "I watched this film for the first time last night in preparation for its highly anticipated sequel. Now if I were to have seen this grace the big screen back in the 80s I may have a sense of nostalgia or maybe would have gabbed at the high flying spectacle indulged throughout its runtime, however it seems to exist only for the novelty of showcasing the dog fights, which to the films credit are for the most part pretty engaging and are quite impressive considering the limitations of its time. The main shortcoming with this film however is that it chooses to focus to much on the spectacle that it fails to develop most of its cast beyond one or two characteristics. This especially hurts the film when Maverick's co-pilot and friend Goose (Anthony Edwards), tragically perishes in training. For the next good bit of the movie Maverick (Tom Cruise) is in mourning, as he should be, however the audience isn't actively mourning with him. We didn't get to know Goose, or really anyone else at all, beyond service level which makes it nearly impossible to buy into the characters relationships. Maverick does go on a bit of an arc, and there are some nice moments between him and his bitter rival Ice Man (Val Kilmer), following Goose's accident, but even there rivalry felt undeveloped. Likewise the romance between Maverick and his instructor and Pentagon adviser Charlotte (Kelly McGillis) is rushed and only comes to a head only because Maverick is unable to take no for an answer. All in all it isn't a horrible film, but it isn't the classic that others would claim it is either. 4/10"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Best Military aviation movie ever. Amazing F-14A Tomcat...I cried in some scenes..."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "A bit cheesy, but still a very enjoyable movie with pretty brilliant cinematography, certainly for an 80's movie. Tom Cruise's acting career literally took off with this movie. Nice to watch again, even after all this time."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "80's action cheese done so, so right. Tony Scott's \"Top Gun\" is as well constructed on a technical level as it is from a pop culture standpoint. So many quotes, moments and images seem almost ready-made for cultural reverberation, it's almost not even fair, but I can't say I'm cynical about it. Like Pete Mitchell himself, the film is so unrelentingly sure of itself that, as an audience member, you kind of just acquiesce to the plucky earnestness of it all. It's been a while since I've seen a movie that's this one with its time without feeling dated in any critical ways. It's an 80's time capsule for all of the most evocative and enjoyable reasons (tone, tropes, music, etc.) The cinematography, though, impressed me the most, with so many shots leaving me asking myself, \"they could do that in 1986?\" Genuinely surprised that this one ended up impressing me as much as it did, but the hype is -- in a way -- real."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Of course this movie is a military propaganda and had a lot of help and influence by the Pentagon. But even if you know that, the movie is good: it shows many beautiful scenes, it is not full of action, but has a story and tries to be a bit above the mainstream.

Seminal photography, excellent pacing, with an energising soundtrack bolstered by the fantastic cast. The screenplay is probably the weakest area but it serves to tell the story so efficiently and with such character it just feels charming. In 4k uhd blu ray, Top Gun looks phenomenal in 2020."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "This movie has become a cult class for many. Others like me don't see the appeal. To be fair it has great actors and a compelling story but it goes a bit too much in the Navy advertising direction for me. Also between the highlights I was bored by the movie. Roger Ebert said in his review something like \u201cThe good scenes are amazing but the weaker once were unbearable\u201d. It might sound to harsh as the movie is no failure. I see a lot of things that could win me over like showing weakness and overcoming it or character development. After the introduction scene the movie is about the pilot Pete Mitchell nickname Maverick and other remarkable pilots who enter the United States Navy Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor program that is familiar know as TOPGUN. This is in short a real life flight school for aerial combat and tactics. It was developed after the failings in air combat during the Vietnam war were investigate as the US pilots did not gain notable advantages and hundreds of aircraft's were lost. It is about character development, relationships, growth and overcoming hurdles beside flying aircraft's. In this regard it got me hooked but like I said the Navy and military advertisement is to overburdened for me. Also there are some weaker segments I would fast forward or forget. It is like multiple courses of meal but you dislike some in between. Then there are the actors. This movie has a cast of really famous actors. Some at the beginning of their careers or not that famous back then. The main actors Tom Cruise and Kelly Mc Gills fully deliver and I praise both of them. The additional cast works also really well with an excellent Val Kilmer to give credit were credit is deserved. Also Meg Ryan, Anthony Edwards and many others were good. A fine overall performance. The visuals and flight scenes are amazing and I see why it captured so many people. Even I who was not that much into this was impressed. The soundtrack is legendary and the tracks \u201cDanger Zone\u201d and even more \u201cTake my Breath away\u201d became hits and are played even today in the radio from time to time. Overall this is not my taste and I am not seeing it as cult classic like others do. However it is a must see movie as others will be shocked if you did not see the movie. Be warned to not criticize it as other take this as insult even when they agree that some parts are weaker."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "The egotistical hero and his rival could easily have been overly corny, but thankfully they\u2019re downplayed so they don\u2019t become stereotypes.
