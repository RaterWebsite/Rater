I feel that this movie could have been a 10/10 if it were not for some writing issues.  Just so you know, this review was produced with my wife's approval, so please don't take this the wrong way when I say that the film is riddled with misogyny references, bad jokes and cheesy, clich\u00e9 plot lines.The Good: Kate Beckinsale (Underworld, 2003) and Stanley Tucci (The Hunger Games, 2012) do a phenomenal job at portraying their characters.  However, their combined AAA stardom eclipses the rather lackluster performance of most of the rest of the cast.  This is the problem with hiring Triple-A Hollywood stars and pitting them in roles alongside TV actors.The Writing: This is where the movie can be hit or miss for many people.  In my case, I *mostly* enjoyed the movie.  If you can stand the misogyny jokes and some poor performances, then you will enjoy this movie.  It was not horrible, and in fact the writing has some brilliant moments that make you feel at awe.  However, it is clear that this is writer Scott Wascha's first film.  At some points it seems that he is trying too hard to make the audience laugh.  On one particular scene babies are involved and it is meant to be funny, but is actually kind of dumb.  Some viewers may find it funny, though so I won't knock off too many points for that scene.  Unfortunately, there is just enough to hate about the writing as there is to love, and so it cancels out in the end.Overall:  If it were not for Beckinsale and Tucci's performance, the movie would fall flat on its back.  Overall, Jolt delivers just enough electric volts to keep you entertained for one viewing, but is ultimately not worth watching again.  My advice is to watch it once for a good time, and then forget about it."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "So much fun!

It aims to become a John Wick like franchise, yet fails to deliver any memorable action set pieces whatsoever. Moreover, if you see the arc of this character, she would have looked like a 'Ronda Rousey'- MMA type person, not somebody like Kate Beckinsdale.  You are lead to believe that somebody as dysfunctional as her would be patient enough to draw perfect make up, and looking great throughout the movie. Again folks, believability and context are important in these types of flicks. So when they went ballistic with the action sequences, audiences would go on with the ride. This one didn't achieve that purpose."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "For starters, I love Kate Beckinsale. She plays a really physical role here and kicks a whole lot of ass in this movie.

The writing is just horrible with both the story and the characters seeming like early attempts at a movie by some college students.In a lot of scenes you have to sit there and realize how the plot and characters are completely incoherent. I honestly expected that there would be a superhero reveal at some point, because the punishment Lindy (Kate Beckinsale) can dish out as well as soak up, is way beyond what any human being could. Her condition does not explain it at all.It's a shame that Kate Beckinsale wasn't put to a better use than this. But also many of the other actors would have had a lot more potential than what they were allowed to show here. It is sad to see that the director didn't have the first clue as to what to do with them.You'll be needing a lot of booze to enjoy yourself with this movie, as it offers nothing above average and even only a few moments reach a level of mediocrity.

Poor storyline."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "SHORT VERSION: Unexpectedly low budget, bad choreography and nonsensical writing make this movie not worth watching. Not even for free. Avoid.LONG VERSION (may contain some spoilers):When I watched the trailer I knew this was going to be a story about how evil men are and how righteous it is for a woman to beat them up. It's a fashion trend that's not going away any time soon, so I accepted it. However, I thought that, at least, this could be an entertaining popcorn action movie with good production value: it's got Amazon's money and a good cast... right? Nope.The whole movie is shot in a set that tries to reproduce an intersection with two or three blocks in each direction, plus a number of indoors locations (most of them one-room, empty). There are no gun fight scenes. The two or three hand to hand combat scenes that are there, are terribly choreographed and shot, with close shots and continuous changes in camera angles to hide what's really happening.Then there's the writing. The premise of the movie is how the condition that afflicts the main character shapes her life... but you get all her background in a narration dump in the first five minutes. The movie then proceeds to show you her daily life and, for those 15 minutes, you kind of get to sympathize with the character (any sympathy you could have for her vanishes when later in the movie she uses a baby as a human shield, but anyway...). But then we move into the \"revenge story\" which takes most of the movie. Here's where the writing goes out the window, especially with the main character saying a one-liner after the other, all of them taken from bad comedies from the nineties that do not make any sense. It felt like the writer (whose only credit on IMDB is this film) tried to convey the notion that the main character copes with her condition through humor, but failed miserably at it.Looking at the few prior credits of the director, it looks like she wanted to make a movie about a girl with a condition trying to have a normal life in a world filled with evil and / or stupid men; but she had to comply with Amazon's mandate to make an action flick, with the additional restriction that  most of the budget went into hiring Kate Beckinsale.Avoid this flick at all costs. Not worth your time; not even for free."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Prime Video released a new action, thriller, Jolt this weekend. You don't even have to leave your home to see Kate Beckinsale kicking butt and not caring about names. Yes, Jolt is one of those action, thrillers but with a twist dealing directly with the lead character's mental health. Kate Beckinsale plays Lindy, a woman who has severe impulse control issues characterized as intermittent explosive disorder. She gets pissed and strikes out in an uncontrollable rage. Lindy has gotten her rages in check with a contraption she wears that will send a shock, or jolt of electricity, if you will, to her. In order to bring some normalcy to her life, Lindy goes on a date with Justin (Jai Courtney), who seems to be a nice guy and a prospect for a lovely future. When Lindy finds out the next morning that Justin was murdered, she sets out on a hunt to find his killer and avenge him. Fights and mayhem ensue.Above, I gave you a quick plot synopsis. The issue with Jolt is that it makes absolutely no sense. Okay, someone avenging the death in a murderous rampage is par for the course of most action thrillers. The part that is ridiculous here is that Lindy has been on two dates with Justin. Why would she go on this long, violent odyssey to avenge his death? She barely knows him! It does not make any sense that she would do what she does in this movie. Yes, Kate Beckinsale is good, aside from the stupid blonde wig, and she is at least passable in the fight sequences, but the motivation of the character is unbelievable. Unfortunately, that's all there is to this movie.There are two good things I will note: First, the runtime is short. I clocked it at an hour and 22 minutes, or so before the credits. Although, I do think that the movie goes on a bit after it actually should have ended. Otherwise, there isn't any wasted time. Second, predictably, there are two cops (Bobby Canavale and Laverne Cox) chasing Lindy as she tears through the city looking for Justin's killer. The best scene of the movie that made me laugh out loud took place during a chase scene between Beckinsale and Cox in a hospital. I won't spoil anymore than that. At the very least, that scene is a must see.Ultimately, Jolt is a ridiculous thriller with a premise that doesn't make a lot of sense. The mental health issue of the lead is treated rather flippantly, but while there are good fight sequences, it doesn't add up to much. If you have an hour and 22 or so minutes free and nothing else to watch, then grab a handful of popcorn for this one should hold you."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Gotta love Kate in this one.
