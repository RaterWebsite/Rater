The plot is interesting and the characters are likable. I really wasn't expecting much from this movie but it really surprised me. Just like some of my favorite action movies it also includes healthy doses of comedy mixed in. All in all I was very impressed with The Three Musketeers and don't have much to complain about except for its slow start."

Christoph Waltz was wonderful as Richelieu, Orlando Bloom surprisingly grown up, Ray Stevenson horribly underused, Matthew McFayden  almost did a great job and the special effects were superb.  The horse was lovely and the derring-do prettily done.  The only really sour notes were the casting of some callow American kid as D'Artagnan ( please!) and this introduction of a bumbling manservant who's 'funnies' were just out of place."

Granted some of the action scenes were pretty ridiculous and there were some plot holes. All in all it was an ok movie to see on a DVD however I am glad I didn't go to the cinema to see that one. Just to recap, as an action movie it's not that bad, go rent it if you enjoy simple action and a lot of combat in your movies."

I think the real reason that it isn't getting great box office numbers, is the lack of marketing, not the lack of storylines or acting abilities. Orlando Bloom and Milla Jovich delivered a solid performance, as expected, but the real star for me was Logan Lerman. AMAZING. I am a fan of his of course, but still, he blew me away with his portrayal of d'Artagan. Overall, great movie definitely worth seeing!"

Acting  is just to cash, over-exagerated personal fight power and intelligence  of the three musketeers, under-estimation of the enemies as if they are dummies. Characters are drawn as if it is a satiric or kiddy movie. Anyhow, perfect 3D, that 's the only entertainment, and it is worth it."

The special effects and the few \"big name\" actors were really what helped this movie pass. The execution of the plot was fairly mechanical, and whatever love story there was really felt just kind of tacked on for standard stakes raising purposes. That said, this movie has one of the most spectacular (though not too dramatic) impaling scenes I've seen yet. And what happened after the false ending is pretty reminiscent of what happened after Paul and Mila's 3-D adventure from last year. Just wait for rental if all you care to see is the 2-D version."

The actors looked ridiculous. Logan Lerman (as D'Artagnan) doesn't looked good with long hair. I wish that Orlando Bloom was given more screen time. Yet, I didn't really cared about his character. At one point, I completely forgotten about him, until he showed up again. Milla Jovovich's character (Milady de Winter) was annoying. This is a very average movie in my opinion, because there are a lot of bad and good elements. There's almost no boring parts whatsoever. None-stop action, epic sword fights, great escapes. I though that the boats in the air were cool. But the dialogue is mediocre, the characters were disappointing, the story is cliche. I don't feel giving this movie a higher rating just because of the action. In general, it's actually an enjoyable movie, if you ignore the bad aspects that I mentioned. It depends how you visualise the film."

The casting was excellent as well except for the lead playing D'Artagnan whose bravado fell short of the target alongside his acting chops, or lack thereof. On the down side - stealing lines from several other films that include The Princess Bride as well as Disney's version (with Chris O'Donnell) of The Three Musketeers doesn't help the poorly scripted dialogue. Fortunately for the writers, the remaining strong cast of actors/actresses manage to make up for the lack of creativity and eloquence. Another negative is the lack of artistic liberty taken from the original story as well as the acceptable, but boring and antiquated soundtrack. Never the less I feel that this movie definitely deserves a look for those who enjoy films with swordplay and/or quasi-fictional period pieces."

      "text": "\"The Three Musketeers\" are one of the fiction books most adapted to cinema. This is another adaptation to add to the extensive list, and it is not one of the best. As the script is known, I will not stop to analyze it. I will, however, make a word of advice that is necessary: this film is not even close to being historically credible. It is an almost complete anachronism and portrays the Musketeers and, especially, Milady, as if they were the 17th century's \"James Bond\", full of tactics and inventive gadgets for all occasions.The film is an adventure that begins in Venice, it involves a flying machine supposedly invented by Da Vinci, many creative weapons, choreographed fights, acrobatics and even climbing and gymnastics routines by women in corsets. A mixture so incredible and absurd that I was expecting to see automobiles too, and that shows how far a writer's creative freedom can reach if they don't get their feet on the ground. However, it is a fun movie and entertains the audience quite well.The cast is one of the strong points of this film. I highlight, on a positive note, the performance of Christoph Waltz, who transformed Richelieu into a skilled and manipulative politician under the garb of a pious clergyman. Milla Jovovich is also quite good as Milady, a double agent with a vast arsenal always up his sleeve. Mads Mikkelsen is very effective as a villain and looks like a fearsome opponent. The musketeers (Luke Evans, Ray Stevenson, Matthew Macfadyen) are good enough, given the rewriting of the characters in this film, but they are almost relegated to supporting characters in their own film, a mistake that is quite common in the movies adaptations of this story. Juno Temple and Freddie Fox are funny as a couple but don't have much to do. On the negative side, I didn't like Logan Lerman, I think he was a weak protagonist despite looking young and elegant, and I think Orlando Bloom, for who he is, simply received too much visibility and relevance in a story where it wasn't necessary, resulting in a tiring presence.Technically, the film is quite spectacular. Cinematography is magnificent, with excellent colors and sharpness, and the film was very well edited and handled in post-production. The CGI is impressive and if more proof was needed that there is a lot of money invested in the film it would be enough to see the choice of filming locations: it is an authentic tour through some of the most beautiful palaces in Bavaria, such as W\u00fcrzburg, Marienberg, Herrenchiemsee, Schlei\u00dfheim and Pommersfelden. If the beauty of these palaces is undeniable, the film was able to emphasize it. I only regret that, at times, the film seems more baroque than it should be, as if the story were being set fifty years later, in the first decades of the 18th century. The same can be said of the costumes, which nevertheless seem impressive and detailed. However, I already said that historical rigor was run over and killed in this film. The soundtrack is not surprising, assuming an appropriately epic tone without being histrionic."
