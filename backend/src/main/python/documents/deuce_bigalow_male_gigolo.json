One day he wrecks the house of a gigolo and needs quick money to repair it. The only way he can make it is to become a gigolo himself, taking on an unusual mix of female clients. He encounters a couple of problems, though. He falls in love with one of his unusual clients, and a sleazy police officer is hot on his trail.", "releaseYear": "1999", "mpaaRating": "R", "imageUrl": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/w0UKAcY4fAPuQW2GhAoIMwutIA5.jpg", "categories": {"plot": 5.0, "acting": 8.0, "ending": 5.0, "soundtrack": 5.0, "cinematography": 5.0, "familyFriendly": 3.0, "funny": 7.545454545454546, "action": 5.0}, "reviews": [{"rating": "8", "text": "Bjjbytguginniughioninugdttsweyuomkkkhfulyedguijggughihhiigguguugyfrsestdugihhihiihihhfeh"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Not a great comedy, but still good one to spend your time with.

As long as you don't sit there taking it too seriously and laugh along at some pretty out there jokes then you will have a good time, but you will need to 'get' Schneider's comedy in order to enjoy it. It's also a clever concept too I think of an Average Joe taking over the role of a Gigolo and he pulls it off perfectly, so if you're in need of a good chuckle look no further"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "One of the laugh out loud comedies from 1999, following in in the footsteps of Austin Powers 2 & Big Daddy also released that year."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Rob Schneider, I don't care if you are friends with Adam Sandler, there are many more comedians more deserving (and more funny) to have the their own movie than you."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Just genious    ."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "A hilarious concept with great acting from Rob."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Hur hur hur - funny!
