  "description": "A new technologically-superior Soviet nuclear sub, the Red October, is heading for the U.S. coast under the command of Captain Marko Ramius. The American government thinks Ramius is planning to attack. A lone CIA analyst has a different idea: he thinks Ramius is planning to defect, but he has only a few hours to find him and prove it - because the entire Russian naval and air commands are trying to find him, too. The hunt is on!",

      "text": "The Hunt for Red October is all saturated with the spirit of the works of Tom Clancy. Stupid, but beautiful and epic. A strong cast, Sean Connery played a great role. In general, the motives of the main characters look comical, the ending is so complete nonsense. Although of course the Western viewer will like everything."

      "text": "\"The Hunt For Red October\" is a 1990 film directed by John McTiernan and stars Alec Baldwin and Sean Connery. The film is adapted from the 1984 Tom Clancy novel about a Soviet nuclear submarine which drops off U.S. scanners, prompting a young CIA analyst (Baldwin) to scramble to find out what the captain's (Connery) motives really are. To start off, I love Tom Clancy. I'm a fairly big fan of his Splinter Cell, Rainbow SIx, and Ghost Recon franchises. I had also heard of \"Red October\" and that it was directed by the guy who made \"Predator\" and \"Die Hard\", so I was already pretty excited to watch this movie. In short, the film did not, in any way, disappoint. What kind of shocked and worried me about this is that this film was filed under the \"Thriller\" section on Netflix. . .and it's rated PG. Needless to say, this fact sort of worried me. I was wrong though - just because this movie is PG does not mean it isn't \"thrilling\" in any sense of the word. \"Red October\" is in fact an \"edge of your seat\" thriller by definition. Almost every facet of this film is excellent. The script, I found, was very witty and well written by Larry Ferguson. The acting was spectacular, specifically of course from Connery and Baldwin. The score was very awesome and appropriate for the source material. The special effects were very good, especially for the late 80's. I'd say that \"The Hunt For Red October\" is a solid thriller that will have a hard time disappointing many of its viewers."

Probably not the best of submarine movies (with some amateurish animated underwater motion scenes) but overall a fantastic adventure with first rate acting by a great cast.  Have to say I find it a thoroughly entertaining and quite gripping film.  I re-watch it every year on dvd and still love it and am impressed by just about all aspects."

      "text": "A classic movie that is at the same time highly valued but rarely spoken about anymore. It has a good cast, tactical cat and mouse games atop on a good story. Lets start at the beginning. The movie is based of the (debut) book from Tom Clancy and is also the first appearance of Jack Ryan who will become one of his most famous characters. The story is set in the cold war era in1984 and starts when the legendary Russian submarine captain Marko Ramius is given the command of the \u201cRed October\u201d a new type of submarine called Typhoon class. It has a new type of impulse engine that makes it practically invisible to (passive) sonar. After an American submarine shadowing the Red October losses contact all alarm bells ring in the USA. Even more a bit later the Soviets deployed all their available navy assets to hunt down Ramius. It seems he got mad and wants to attack the USA on his own. However CIA analyst Jack Ryan has a different idea and believes that Ramius wants to defect and hand over the submarine to the USA. With this set up the story starts. It is engaging, immersive and is enhanced by the good characters. I like also the suspense and tactical cat and mouse games. It is no wonder that it worked well because the book was a bestseller and started Tom Clancy\u2019s legacy as legendary novelist. Director John McTiernan successfully adapted the book into a great movie and I praise him for this. Lets continue with the cast. We have a lot of great actors for the movie. Sean Connery is a fantastic captain Marko Ramius. It is one of his great performances even when it is not as much praised as his other roles. He fully delivers his role. Alec Baldwin plays an excellent Jack Ryan that is truly convincing. Sidenote it is an interesting discussion topic which actor is the best Jack Ryan. Back to the movie. Stellan Skarsgard as captain Tupolev is really good and I wanted more of him in the movie. The other roles have fine actors too with for example Tim Curry, James Earl Jones, Scott Glenn or Joss Ackland. A truly good cast. I enjoyed how they fill their roles with life and make them believable characters with understandable motives. Visually the movie creates an intense and realistic feeling atmosphere. They put a lot of effort into the sets and details. I highly appreciate this but must remark that I have not even basic level of understanding about the Navy, how life on a submarines is and naval warfare in general like most of the viewers. I say a realistic approach is wasted on most if the main audience does not have the knowledge to evaluate it (In an entertainment movie. For a documentary it is a no brainer must have).  The soundtrack by Basil Poledouris is amazing and also nearly never brought up on favorite list. It enhance the atmosphere. Overall this was a movie I enjoyed a lot. It is a classic for its time and the good performance is worth an additional point to get a 10/10 rating. Worth watching and remembering."

      "text": "More proof that Ebert is a hypocrite. I note unlike some films he has criticized, his moral centre seems rather off here. This film is a highly inaccurate account of the true story of Red October. That aside, look at what this film advocates, State theft of the property of another country. Hardly the actions of a whiter than white State and rather reminiscent of Firefox. More State stealing another State's secrets. If this was the theft of American property we would hear that this was the work of Satan or profound Evil. The acting was fine, the script was to much like US propaganda and little to do with telling a true story. K19 with Harrison Ford did this much better and was an infinitely superior film. This is dated Cold War rhetoric."

An effective thriller with a lot of humor, intrigue and the mandatory submarine movie elements. It is also one of those refreshing films that doesn't treat the audience like idiots. Even the visual effects are not to bad for the era."

      "text": "a neat and clean hunting..The Hunt For Red October3 Out Of 5The Hunt For Red October is a plot driven thriller feature about an underwater and unspoken battle between two nations that is tossed by a man with broken agendas. Despite of all the chalky and cheesy material, the plot is surprisingly mature than one would expect especially in its final act. It still doesn't suggest in any way that the writing is smart or even gripping, in fact it is the weakest link of all in its initial stages. By now, it is clear that the makers took way too much time to set in the plots and characters to its palpable surrounding where most of the act is saved by the star power and the presence of it that is immensely articulative like surfing on water. Another one of its strength would be the ability to manipulate multiple characters on screen like a puppet with a mystic air presence among them that breeds nothing but uncertainty to the viewers. The camera work is appreciative and nicely done but isn't attractive or pleasing to encounter. The adapted screenplay is not one of its pros, although its execution by the director McTiernan surpasses the shallow script in here. Connery's cunningness is challenged equally by Baldwin's attentive and humble nature along with an amazing supporting cast like Glenn, Neill and Jones. An unexpected final act, a bit western-y dialogues and the tense environment with which it feeds itself are the high points of the feature. It is rich on technical aspects like sound effects and editing whilst falls flatly on background score and visual effects. The Hunt For Red October is a neat and clean hunting for its tendency to keep the screen lit with light and breezy theme despite of being a dark nature."

      "text": "This film portrays the defection of a group of Russian naval officers who move to the American side of the Cold War aboard one of the most powerful Soviet submarines. However, neither the Russians nor the Americans know the intentions of Commander Ramius, which triggers a hunt to sink or capture the missing submarine. It's definitely one of the best submarine movies ever, not so much for authenticity (which is none) but for story telling and action. The film quickly catches our attention and only drops at the end. It quickly creates a pleasant tension that never exceeds desirable limits and keeps us interested in what we are watching. Sean Connery is impeccable as usual, achieving in this film one of the most memorable performances of his career (if we did not count his participation in the 007 saga). The actor knows how to dominate the film without stealing too much the scene of the colleagues, standing out at the appropriate times. Alec Baldwin was also well on his character, as well as most of the actors involved in the film, and it is full of well-known stars (Sam Neill, James Earl Jones, Tim Curry or Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd are good examples). Visually, it is elaborate and well made, with good cinematography and discrete but effective visual and special effects."

Overall, the performances of Connery and Baldwin especially make this movie thrilling and suspenseful to watch."
