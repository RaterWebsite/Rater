The John Carpenter influence within the ominous atmospheric camerawork and soundtrack was prevalent and worked flawlessly. The old trailer park setting was so fitting for the overall story and served as an unsettling playground for brutality to set in. This film upped the intensity to an extremely entertaining level with some very unexpected scares and some truly bizarre and grotesque imagery. While some of the cheesy cliches were around, they felt like they belonged there for it to truly be an old school slasher. Instead of random knocks and stupid games played by the strangers in the first film, there were vicious bouts of action packed visceral brutality and damn right insanity by the villains. Johannes Roberts is a director to watch after this awesome film and his style is seeping with foreboding fun. Overall one of the more enthralling and exciting horrors I've seen."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I really enjoyed this movie. You know what to expect if you've seen the trailer or the original film, and it doesn't disappoint.

It doesn't break any new ground, but it is a good follow-up to the original.

It was such a unique film, I remember feeling like I'd never seen anything like it. It certainly stuck with me long after leaving the theatre. The sequel was announced almost immediately and yet for some reason we had to wait 10 years to finally see it. So was it worth the wait? You better believe it was.This film is nothing short of incredible. There isn't a single poor scene in the film. Each and every one of them is like a little mini masterpiece. A lot of that stems from the characters. They are perfectly created. They are flawed (thus realistic) and yet likeable and relatable at the same time. This is a crucial element to what makes this film so good, because I desperately wanted these characters to survive.The same trio of villains are back again and they are even more menacing this time around. They are relentless in their pursuit and it has to be said that the pacing of this film can take your breathe away. There is also a jump-scare (I'm not sure it even used music, simply the visual and a line of dialogue) that is unquestionably one of the most effective I've ever seen.Don't expect the film to play out the way you expect it to. I know it certainly didn't for me. It went to places that I never foresaw and I loved them all. The music, the camera work, the creation of tension - they all combine to produce a horror masterpiece that is even better than the already brilliant original. Please see this film."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Change is the name of the game for this sequel. Prey at Night ditches it's predecessor's slower, more methodical approach in order to go all-out '80s slasher throwback on us. It's a darn good one too.While callbacks to the first film show that many of this masked, serial killing family's rituals are still very much alive, it's clear that they've been up to a lot in the 10 years since we last saw them. They've evolved. They're bolder, more experienced, and even a little sloppier as a result. One of the interesting things about the first movie was finding out that Dollface was a beginner who maybe even struggled a little with the act of taking lives. To see her now as a seasoned murderer without a single speck of hesitation or remorse is haunting. All three of them have a greater level of confidence. Gone are most of the mind games. These psychopaths are ready for the chase.The location fits their new approach well. A wide open trailer park replaces the more confined setting of the earlier remote vacation home. It's got a Camp Crystal Lake vibe (sans lake) and allows for bigger set pieces to alongside the increased amount of gore. I love how the \"Strangers\" are still making great use of shadows to eerily watch their prey from a distance. It was one of the defining aspects of the first film for me and it's just as creepy as ever.The soundtrack is once again a notable part of the experience. Just not as frequently as before. '80s pop replaces the country music and delivers some great moments. Kim Wilde's \"Kids in America\" is used to make one of my favorite openings to any movie ever.Did I mention it's gorgeous too? Johannes Roberts loves showing off each killer's creepy mask with beautiful cinematography. The colorful lights and underwater shots of the pool scene are stunning in their everyday nature. This definitely feels like a real place families would go on vacation and the movie makes every average inch of it look great.So what didn't work for me? Only two things really. The expositional family drama is rather clich\u00e9 and doesn't do anything more than focus on the antagonistic side of the protagonists' relationship with one another until they reach their (final) destination. At which point the action ramps up. Nothing too bad, but kind of \"eh\" overall. Then there's the ending scene which I hated. I get that this is part love letter to the slasher classics from back in the day. Shoot, one of my favorite scenes is a clear homage to the ending of Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. But right before the credits roll it kind of goes a bit too far and steps on the fact that these killers are supposed to be average people. It's part of what made the previous Strangers so special.I think watching this in close proximity with it's predecessor is the best way to do it. Doing so increased my enjoyment a lot as it provided some nice catharsis after the events of that film. You'll also get the full picture of just how strongly the antagonists have grown into their career of senseless violence. This is an almost entirely different kind of horror movie than the one it serves as a follow-up to, but the way it handles the killers makes it feel like the next logical step. The way it borrows from it's inspirations makes it more than just a good emulation, but a slasher strong enough to maybe even stand beside those greats it so clearly looks up to.8.5/10"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "As someone who really enjoyed the first film I'm quite surprised that a sequel took so long to appear. I wasn't sure what to expect but I knew that I wanted to like this... and I did! I actually liked it even more than I thought I would, I was prepared for a lesser copy of the first film but that's not quite what we got. Yes, it has the same basic concept, but other than that it's got a totally different vibe this time; 80s homage, stylish, hip, gruesome yet tongue-in-cheek and it works. You can tell that the director and the performers really cared about what they were doing and this entirely makes up for a fairly empty script. Visually, this is full of eye candy; and scares-wise it's pretty good too, I definitely jumped a few times and felt very unsettled the whole way through which to me. There was merely one moment towards the very end that I genuinely didn't like that I thought was one step too far in homage but overall my expectations were met and exceeded and not only am I interested in following this director but I'd like to see another sequel but only if the same level of effort is put into it."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "How in the world does this have a 50 on here???

Not only do they make decisions no rational human would make, they essentially stand there and wait to be killed.  There is nothing scary about the antagonists other than they seem to be able to teleport and mystically sense where the protagonists are at all times.  At one point the protagonists have a gun... A GUN!.. and their persuers have only used knives or sharp objects.  So... the movie is over right?  They have an extreme tactical advantage over their opponent.  Surely there is no possible way they can combat a gun with a few knives.  Except, the gun dissappears a few scenes later!  It's never fired, despite having one of the people who murdered their mother and father dead to rights in point blank range, it's never shown to be taken or dropped or even holstered.  It's just magically gone so the rest of the movie can happen.  The creators of this film believe that if someone's throat is slit, they die immediately.  Do they believe that your heart is in your throat?  You have to bleed to death!  Many people have survived getting their throats slit.  This movie was made by braindead people for braindead people.  You have to be dumber than a rock to think this movie is plausible in any reality.  People are not dumb enough to just sit there while a psychopath stabs you.  Arms are a thing, and it's instinct to move them in front of things that could hurt you.  Yes, the people in this movie had to fight their instincts in order to be complacent in their own murder!

It was enjoyable and I dug the somewhat realistic take on the slasher genre. So when The Strangers: Prey at Night was announced, I was fairly hopeful that we'd get a solid sequel. Unfortunately, we did not. The Strangers: Prey at Night is directed by Johannes Roberts and stars Christina Hendricks, Bailee Madison, and Lewis Pullman. It follows the same trio of killers from the first movie as they prey on a new group of unsuspecting folks, and the setting is probably the movie's best aspect. The concept of setting this story in a trailer park is pretty compelling and interesting, and it held my attention throughout the film. Alas, this movie is dragged down to a fairly low level by a mediocre script and all of the characters being unbelievably stupid. I mean really, really stupid. I understand that this is a slasher film, and the characters in slasher films aren't typically the smartest peeps on the block....but still, the characters in this movie make decisions that legitimately don't make any sense. I also have some issues with the story itself, but my issues are mostly towards the end so I'll shy away from them so I don't spoil anything. Just know that I'm not a fan of the direction that they go with the trio of killers late in the movie. There's still some enjoyment to be had with this movie.

With atrocious character writing, worse than the first strangers film, this movie has no idea who to focus on. You don't really get a glimpse as to who the main character is really at all. Not to mention, the characters aren't interesting in the slightest. The film gives you nothing to cheer for. The family drama in the first 20 minutes is rushed and forced upon the audience and doesn't pan out well throughout the film.

In Prey at Night, there's no suspense. Absolutely zero elements of horror. It's like stalker porn on crack. I'm not exactly sure why there's an 80's style score in this film either. Prey at Night adds nothing new. Its ideas are dull and dry and it produces honestly the worst ending to a film I think I've ever seen.

Sin embargo, la secuela no es tan buena como la original debido a la dependencia de clich\u00e9s y personajes d\u00e9biles. El ritmo es lento y la trama es predecible. Los villanos son la mejor parte de la pel\u00edcula, pero la pel\u00edcula se empantana por las malas decisiones que toman los personajes. La banda sonora es buena y las im\u00e1genes est\u00e1n bien logradas. La escena final es incre\u00edble y el final es insatisfactorio. En general, no es una pel\u00edcula terrible, pero no es tan buena como la original."}], "recommendations": ["dark_skies", "chernobyl_diaries", "house_of_1000_corpses", "insidious_chapter_2", "texas_chainsaw_3d", "paranormal_activity_2", "malignant", "devil", "paranormal_activity_the_marked_ones", "insidious", "countdown", "final_destination", "vacancy", "happy_death_day", "p2", "final_destination_2", "terrifier", "the_ring", "the_possession", "the_ritual", "happy_death_day_2u", "the_last_house_on_the_left", "the_forest", "it_follows", "crawl"]}
