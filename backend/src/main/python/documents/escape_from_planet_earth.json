Saw it opening day, went with another family, 5 kids, we and they all really liked it.  No it's not a Pixar mega movie by any means, but it's still good.  We laughed, the kids laughed, there were some adult orientated jokes as expected, etc etc.  Saying the movie had no depth?  Ok, I guess, it's not DEEP, but it's a kids flick.  Nerdy alien brother, helps save the day over stronger jock brother, and the aliens escape the planet.  Don't listen to the hard A$$es on here, they are out to lunch.

This movie has all the hallmarks of a Mainframe studios production...or it would, if this were over a decade ago, before Mainframe became Rainmaker, and eliminated every part aspect of creativity and life within this studio.\r As it stands, this movie is just awful. It has no consistent theme, not an quanta of depth within it, and will bore you to tears if you don't walk right out of the theater. It is everything Mainframe wasn't. Everything Pixar isn't. It was painful. Shrek 5 painful.\r If you must see this movie, stop and grab a good book along the way, that way you'll have something to entertain you.

The animation is top-notch and looks great on my 55-in HDTV via BluRay but that's really the only thing that separated it from being a standard plot live-action film. Not sure why they opted for expensive A/B-list voice talent unless that was supposed to draw adults in.

It had us laughing through the whole movie."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "The first words that come to my mind when I'm done watching the movie are: unoriginal, and stereotypical. How many times have I heard of aliens? Too many times. They already have done an animated alien movie, which, not my opinion, but in others opinions not very good. Who in there right mind would expect anything better then that success rate? Maybe I don't have much to say about the stereotypical part of the movie, but there are other things that caught my attention, forgettable characters, usually a movie has at least one unforgettable character. For me there was ZERO. Another issue I had was a glitch in the story line (or two, or more), well maybe just one, but it was sure noticeable. The humans up in the booth. What did the main character say about having to come to Earth? It was a hassle to go 14 or 15 light years to get to Earth. From what I've seen, the humans didn't come with them back to their planet. Why would they go out of their way to go and get the two humans if it was such a hassle? Many unanswered questions, 2.4/10"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Clever, smart, and funny, Escape from Planet Earth is a thrilling animated good time at the movies.  Its not a fabulous movie, but it still is a whole lot of fun with some smart humor, exciting moments, and some feel-good lessons on family, heroism and sibling bonding.  The animation, while paling in comparison to \"Brave\" and \"How To Train Your Dragon\" is still sleek and cartoony.\r There's also not much to complain about.  A few gross-out gags and a couple of other odd moments are as problematic as it gets.  Some of the sci-fi explosions and whiz-bang action may be too intense for the youngest viewers.\r For a more detailed review, visit www.moviestakenseriously.blogspot.com"}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Escape From Planet Earth is not a bad movie but is by no means a compliment. Yes it does have some laughs and some clever ideas but the problems with this movie prevent them from shing. The story is clich\u00e9, most of the jokes are not that funny, the characters are not that interesting, and the majority of the character models aren\u2019t good to look at. This is the film you put on to keep your 5 year old quiet and entertained for an hour and a half. For everyone else you can afford to skip it. There is nothing here worth your while outside of a couple laughs but they are not worth it.

It's all about the relationship between aliens, which you as viewer can reflect back to yourself. A heart warming cartoon that is at par with the greater productions of Disney or Dreamworks. Great ending.\r - The graphics are less good than the best cartoons, difference is like disney 10 and Escape from earth is 7.5, but hey , a good cartoon is a combination of multiple things that make it good or best.\r - As a cartoon lover, I like only the cartoons that are not too expensive and have a good morale.\r - Common jokes woven into the story.\r - Bad guys loose and good guys win!\r If you see this cartoon, watch it, you will not be disappointed! recommended!"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Before going into this movie, I knew that the movie is not going to be as good as a Pixar animation or a Dreamworks one. However, Escape from Planet Earth is really entertaining, funny and heartfelt at some parts.

The story gets off to a solid start. Brendan Fraser and Rob Corddry both were decent and were somewhat unrecognizable.\r The Bad: For the most part, aside from who I mentioned above, the voice cast was awful. The story itself becomes pretty mundane and run-of-the-mill, even for a kids movie. The animation was nothing special. Animated films have come a long way in the last 10-20 years (both in style and story) and the bar has been raised ... this particular film falls well below it."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Why?

No tengo mucho que decir de esto, algunos personajes son planos y algo aburridos, no parecen tener mucha personalidad (excepto gary) los alienigenas del \u00e1rea 51 apenas me agradan, no dan risa, pero no irritan mucho... La animaci\u00f3n est\u00e1 bien, a pesar de que la pel\u00edcula sea de bajo presupuesto, con 40 millones de d\u00f3lares puedes hacer animaci\u00f3n decente. La banda sonora es poco memorable, no llegas a recordar ninguna pista o m\u00fasica en alg\u00fan momento. Tambi\u00e9n la comedia es estupida, ninguno de los chistes da risa, est\u00e1n mal ejecutados, el \u00fanico chiste que me dio risa fue en la guerra de comida, cuando unos tipos del \u00e1rea 51 veian la pelea, pero la c\u00e1mara estaba en blanco y negro, y no ten\u00eda audio, y uno de ellos empez\u00f3 a tocar el piano como si fuera un cortometraje de los 40's. Pero todos los chistes son mierda... La ejecuci\u00f3n de la pel\u00edcula es bastante rara. Cuando pasa una escena, pasa r\u00e1pidamente a otra, siendo esta muy apresurada, al hermano de gary lo secuestran a los 20 minutos de haber empezado la pel\u00edcula, dando como se puso muy apresurado la pel\u00edcula, aparte que cuando pasa una escena, con los mismos u otros personajes en otro escenario, parece como si fuera otra pel\u00edcula, o algo as\u00ed..\r Bueno, esta pel\u00edcula no la odio, y me parece un poco mala, al menos, tengo 12 a\u00f1os, y esta es otra de esas pel\u00edculas que no me gustan, como que este tipo de pel\u00edculas tiene un \"toque que no me agrada\" por as\u00ed decirlo...
