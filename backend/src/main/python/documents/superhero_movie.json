      "text": "Superhero Movie is not a completely satisfying comedy film. It works to an extent as an accurate Spider-Man parody. It has serviceable comedy performances from Drake Bell, Christopher McDonald and Leslie Nielsen and has an amusing minor role for Jeffrey Tambor, and the whole cast make the very best they can of writer/director Craig Mazin's mostly uninspiring script. The film is far weaker when the story veers off on tangents and tries to spoof films other than Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films in obvious and embarrassingly unfunny ways, particularly criminal is the offensively bad X-Men parody featuring Tracy Morgan. Since it does make you laugh now and again (mostly from ZAZ-influenced jokes that likely resulted from David Zucker serving as one of the film's producers), Superhero Movie is definitely on the better side of bad films, and is far superior to the woeful Epic Movie and Disaster Movie. It's just a shame that it's not more consistently funny, as there is little left to hide Craig Mazin's pretty sloppy filmmaking technique when you're not laughing. At the end of the day, being \"the best of the Scary Movie spin-offs\" isn't really much of an accolade."

Well, Holmberg would certainly be pleased with \"Superhero Movie\", in which Dragonfly(Drake Bell) throws body blow after body blow into the Dalai Lama's solar plexus. Barry Andrews, the lead singer of Shreikback, wrote an amazing song called \"Gunning for the Buddha\"(from the album \"Big Night Music\"), that was incredibly offensive, but undeniably artful, and ultimately, provocative. \"Superhero Movie\" is not artful, or provocative. Beating up the Dalai Lama is just plain mean. The \"Police Squad\" movies, starring Leslie Nielsen, were irreverent, but nice. When Priscilla Presley stepped down from a ladder, and Lieutenant Frank Drebit said, \"Nice beaver,\" before the King's widow produces an actual beaver. That was funny. What's not funny? Disturbing a scantily-dressed female corpse at an open casket burial. There's not an actor alive who could make this funny. Nielsen, he tries."
