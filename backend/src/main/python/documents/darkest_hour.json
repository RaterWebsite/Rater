  "description": "A thrilling and inspiring true story begins on the eve of World War II as, within days of becoming Prime Minister of Great Britain, Winston Churchill must face one of his most turbulent and defining trials: exploring a negotiated peace treaty with Nazi Germany, or standing firm to fight for the ideals, liberty and freedom of a nation. As the unstoppable Nazi forces roll across Western Europe and the threat of invasion is imminent, and with an unprepared public, a skeptical King, and his own party plotting against him, Churchill must withstand his darkest hour, rally a nation, and attempt to change the course of world history.",

      "text": "2 hours of missed opportunities. Elements of the film are complete fiction and completely dismiss established characterizations of events. There is also some absurdities. The idea that the British government was somewhat indifferent to the idea of going to war with Hitler until a little girl on a subway train convinced Churchill to stick it to Adolph is insulting to viewers. Watch THE GATHERING STORM and IN TO THE STORM for a better depiction of this time. This film, along with DUNKIRK, are piece of hyper-patriotic British war propaganda that alter history to make defeat, retreat and capitulation look heroic. These films insult the contributions made by French and American and other allies. Churchill is portrayed as a comical buffoon. SKIP IT!"

      "text": "A film that's mostly people sitting in rooms talking relies on good writing and strong performances to make it effective. Luckily, this film has both. Sure, Gary Oldman nails the look and style of Winston Churchill, but he goes beyond that to create a character with complex presence and emotional depth. If you saw DUNKIRK, then you know about the massive effort to evacuate the British army from the coastal town in France, while the Nazis are threatening their destruction. This film takes place behind the scenes in London, when Churchill strives to save the troops, while planning to lead Britain into the war\u2026.all despite massive political opposition. Oldman is in almost every scene and his charisma (both as the Prime Minister and as an actor) carries the weight with award-worthy skill. He brings this challenging situation to life and makes the circumstances much more enthralling than you might expect."

I recommend reading these Wikipedia entries before watching \"Darkest Hour\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_1940_War_Cabinet_crisishttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunkirk_evacuationhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Arielhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Cycle"

Just great acting, and an interesting story that makes you wonder what the world might have become had England capitulated. One of this year's finest movies.  Kudos to both Gary Oldman and Lily James (who plays Churchill's secretary).  Makes you want to know more about this amazing man, who is an English icon, but almost completely unknown to younger generations of Americans. Makes for a nice companion piece to Dunkirk, without the confusing timelines. Ben Mendelsohn's portrayal of the speech impaired King George VI is both credible and strikingly different from the impression given in The Kings Speech. The underground war room London is now a museum open to the public and well worth seeing if you have the chance."

      "text": "\"Will you stop interrupting me while I am interrupting you!\"'Darkest Hour' is this years 'Lincoln'. Both films star a well respected actor who is unrealizable and brings one of the best performances of their career. History sure dose repeat itself.It's quite shocking more actors have played Winston Churchill than James Bond, Spider-Man, and Doctor Who. Lets not forget we had another movie about Winston Churchill early this year named 'Churchill' staring Brain Cox. However, my excitement for Oldman to play the British bull dog was high, because I knew he's gonna stick his teeth into this meaty role, and he sure did. Gary Oldman was absolutely terrific and not once will you guess it's him. The level of humility, fear, and rage Oldman brought to role makes you see another side to Churchill. Almost like an inside look. He continues to be a legend and this is his finest hour.Ben Mendelsohn, Kristin Scott Thomas, and Lily James all delivered solid performances in supporting roles. Each character has a major role in Churchill's life. Leaving a strong impression on me.Without giving away too much, but there's a great scene in the film where Churchill goes onto the subway for the first time. He meets regular people and listens to them in person. It's probably one of the best scenes I've seen this year.The cinematography was really stunning and Joe Wright directs the hell out of it. Even through some scenes go on a little bit too long for it's runtime. There's a lot of dialogue heavy scenes which may turn some people off, which it did for me at times.Overall rating: Any British or history buff will really enjoy this one. It's a well crafted movie that's doesn't feel like one of those TV made films you sometimes get."

Sort of remembering the outcome and having seen it just a few months ago are two different things.Oldman\u2019s makeup as Prime Minister Winston Churchill is masterful as he doesn\u2019t resemble the man at all but he becomes the heavy drinking, heavy cigar smoking, and orator of the first order. He is faced not only with having to make a decision that will affect his country and its citizens but he is also facing the other powerful men in his government who are talking of making a peace deal with Hitler.Oldman is surrounded by excellent actors like Ronald Pickup as Neville Chamberlain, the previous Prime Minister, Ben Mendelsohn as King George VI, Stephen Dillane as Foreign Secretary Halifax along with Kristin Scott Thomas as Churchill\u2019s wife and Lily James as his new secretary.There is one scene of Churchill riding the tube, being recognized and talking to the people whose fate he must decide which is fun and moving from the beginning to the end. It, also, leads up to one of his most famous speeches \u201cWe shall fight\u201d that, after all these years, is as moving as delivered by Oldman as it was delivered by Churchill himself.The directing, screenwriting, photography and music are a little slipshod taking away from many of the scenes but the performance by Gary Oldman holds the film together and makes \u201cDarkest Hour\u201d worth seeing."

As a big history buff, I expected more detail, more intrigue and some new insights.The truth is it is quite average when it comes to suspense, action and you do not feel the gravity of the Darkest Hour. I would have preferred if more themes were explored. As it is, it might as well be named Much Ado About Nothing. Will I ever watch it again? No. Will it be remembered as a classic? No. Is it worth a watch? I guess so. It is certainly better than other Oscar contenders."

His voice keeps reminding me of South Park's Cartman and he is always either whispering of shouting. He looks like a caricature of Winston Churchill from a sitcom, honestly. The directing is bland, but there are some interesting shots sometimes.The script is the worst part. Darkest Hour is basically two hours of men in suits talking to each other. Filmmaking is so incredible because it allows you to tell stories through dialogue and images. But Darkest Hour tells its story entirely through dialogue, so there's no reason for it to be a film. Every information you get from this movie is conveyed through dialogue. They should have just made a radionovela instead.I have to give credit where credit is due, though. The makeup is amazing."

I'm still beyond surprised that even \"We will fight them on the beaches\", among the impactful speeches of the entire 20th century, falls flat.

      "text": "I had my reservations about seeing this movie, but since Gary Oldman was playing the part of Churchill, I figured it was worth a shot.    First, I am not a fan of Churchill.    For those of us who know a little WWI history, the man was responsible for the inexcusable needless slaughter of 25000 or more British sailors and soldiers in the invasion of the strip of dirt called Gallipoli that jutted out into the Dardanelle straits, leaving them to horrific fates by the Ottomans, who easily defended the strait.    Churchill belligerently refused to withdrawal until it was already marked as one of the most pointless and brutal massacres in WWI history.    He would never admit wrongdoing for this event, and in my view should never have been a politician ever again.    But \"Darkest Hour\" is historically quite accurate, and I was pleased to see the disaster of Gallipoli was not ignored.    Nor was his heavy drinking.    However, with Hitler's imminent takeover of France and the east side of the channel, and a state of war already declared, for this brief period Churchill did act appropriately.    Neville Chamberlain was pathetic.    He had flown to Berlin at Hitler's behest to end up allowing the dictator to take Austria and the Czech Republic free and clear in exchange for a \"pact\" that he naively thought would bring the U.K. \"peace in our time\".    Even when Hitler violated the agreement by invading Poland and resulted in touching off the European theater of WWII, (Japan well on her way in Manchuria since 1937), Chamberlain and fellow coward Viscount Halifax would sue for a wilting borderline treasonous \"deal\" with the Germans, even after having been royally suckered.    Pacifism is one thing - when the mightiest army of the history of the world up to that time was on the verge of attempting the complete annihilation of your nation, however, to be so cowardly was indeed a war crime in itself.    Churchill refused to kowtow to this effort by Chamberlain and Halifax, and it was his steadfastness and determination along with the support of the British population that would ultimately persevere, draining the Luftwaffe dry and forcing Hitler to abandon plans for a full scale invasion.    Oldman is terrific, as are the supporting cast.    There is almost no real war action but the tension in the month before the Battle of Britain was to commence is palpable.    Great care was taken to present as accurately as possible the historic events, and as a person who loves history but is sick to death of the immediate spin and **** that accompanies every aspect of our lifetimes, I appreciated the attempts to exclude any one \"favorable\" propaganda spin over another.    It's a gripping tale, and well worth the time."

      "text": "Darkest Hour is a film that missed its true calling as a Sunday afternoon TV movie. It certainly plays like it was created for television, with the lack of any real visualization of the script other than pointing the camera at the actors and having them wave their arms around as they speechify or proving a hindrance that massively tests a person's patience and willingness to pay attention. Another cinematographic grievance is the film constantly using dolly shots whenever it's not just people standing talking in a room, which isn't anything you notice immediately but it's definitely annoying after a while.The cast is OK other than Oldman, who's legitimately great turn as a fat, balding, alcoholic Michael Caine is one of the better interpretations of Churchill being performed on screen. The film feels very fluid and almost jaunty at first but it does drag on way too long, the whole screenplay doesn't really have any excuse for how uninteresting it manages to be with its material because it's based on some of the most dramatic events in history. The little touches of cliche that permeate the mess of storytelling created, such at the random interest in Churchill's typist so that we don't feel like he's spending the entire film talking to himself, or the vilification of Neville Chamberlain and Lord Halifax, in order to give the film an actual antagonist, drive me up the wall. Maybe I'm being harsh on the film because Churchill might have actually been very personable with his typist and  maybe Chamberlain/Halifax were horrible for the war effort post-Chamberlain's resignation, but honestly that'd be worse for my judgment of this film, because it makes me inherently  doubt it's own historicity purely on the basis of it making plausibly historical elements feel cliche.A few other elements rubbed me the wrong way. There's a scene where Churchill literally decides the fate of the country on polling random strangers on the London underground, which must be the most cringeworthy scene in the history of film. It feels like the writer(s) of this film ran out of ways to perpetuate the themes of the script, so came up with some outlandishly hamfisted way of getting the point across that blows any pretence of realism out of the water. This movie somehow had me on the side of the people that history proved wrong, just on the basis that they were the ones that made the best arguments in the script. I think that's a bit of a problem if you're supposedly making a film based on true events, to be perfectly honest.Also, as an aside, I hate the cliche that this movie also revels in of historical films about famous people where they get eureka moments off of some offhandedly mentioned dialogue to come up with what they're most known for instead of them just doing so out of long arduous thought. It's kind of insulting to the intelligence.Despite all of this, I can't say I hated the movie as a whole, Oldman is great in this, there's a few interesting or well created scenes and a couple of small laughs here and there, and I didn't feel like I'd completely wasted my time. So there's that."

That seems appropriate for a wonderful telling of a brand new aspect of what made Churchill the greatest man of the last century and perhaps of all time.Because this film shows us just how much pressure Halifax and weaker members of the British establishment, put on Churchill to do a deal with Adolf Hitler. A deal that would have preserved the British Empire instead of bankrupting it to the tune of \u00a3145 Billion. (Junkers please note). You will learn much about Britain and Churchill and the crisis of May 1940 in this terrific film.Gary is as absolutely spell binding just as you would expect him to be. What you might not expect is an equally amazing performance by Ben Mendelssohn as King George (Ben was the the bad brother in Blood Lines). Lilly James is also super as the long suffering secretary to to Winston and Kristen Scott Thomas almost steals each scene as Clemmie, Winston's wife.The film isn't perfect. The scene on the London Underground was silly and irritating and more money should have been spent on the computer graphics. But I still give this a score of 10 because of something unexpected.The film is emotional. I felt myself choked up on 3 occasions not just because I am a Brit who loves the story but because Joe Wright takes us into the hearts of the characters and makes us feel their fear, their hope and their pain.Lastly the film is a wonderful reminder that Britain is special and different. It cannot be taken away that we did stand alone, without hope, without support from the USA, when all seemed lost. A salient reminder to remoaners that Europe often needs Britain.

Instead, the movie focuses on Churchill as he first comes into power up to the point of the Dunkirk evacuation, he deals with the doubts many people have about him, and it shows the process of how he made many of his great speeches. In addition, it shows the debates he has with other members of parliament over Hitler, whether Britain should fight on or sign a peace agreement. In many ways, this is a political drama in addition to a biography.In a sense, this movie is a companion piece to Dunkirk, as this movie mainly shows the conflict from Churchill's point of view while that movie showed the conflict from the soldiers point of view. The best part of this movie is Gary Oldman. He does a terrific job playing Churchill. He shows both charm and charisma. Unfortunately, the story is a let down. It's a very interesting story, but it would've worked better as a tv mini-series or normal documentary. As a film, the story feels as if parts and details were cut out or shortened and it makes the overall film feel rather dull and a little disjointed in areas.In the end, Darkest Hour benefits from a terrific performance from Oldman, but apart from him, there's not much else to see unfortunately."

      "text": "First order of business, I say Gary Oldman (The Dark Knight, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy) deserves to win the Oscar for Best Actor! The range of his vulnerability as Winston Churchill truly comes out through the fear echoed behind his eyes and voice, a haunting disappearance into the role.All other ways Darkest Hour crafts Churchill should guarantee amazement, starting with the latex prosthetics used to transform Oldman into the man of the hour: a flawless milestone in Hollywood makeup design. Pretty much right away his lesser known arrogant side comes out, especially once he presses his controversial decisions to push the UK\u2019s attack on Nazi, Germany. He publicly flaunts his odd plan by making a V handshape for the reporters, backwards by the way, which he later learns means not victory, but \u201cup your bum.\u201d So the balance between Churchill\u2019s funnier, personal traits and his positive well-known qualities earns its appreciation. Our present age could use a more complete Churchill depiction, a man who shares our president\u2019s most prominent commonalities, both good and bad.Alongside scene-stealer Oldman, the rest of the cast generates desperate, yet compassionate performances, particularly in how the underrated actress Kristin Scott Thomas, (The English Patient) attentively complements Oldman as wife Clementine Churchill.Beyond the people, the technicians also achieve great heights without being too greedy onscreen. Production designer Sarah Greenwood (Anna Karenina, Atonement) recreates the lovely detailed historical setting by enclosing squares and circles upon a pressured Churchill. Likewise, the soft cream colors by cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel (Am\u00e9lie, Inside Llewyn Davis) set up singular stark backlights to diffuse the overall appearance of what looks like an old historical tape painted by British pride. The feature\u2019s desaturated look soon finds a rupture in its style in the heavy moment of Churchill\u2019s first live speech, when a deep red light floods the room. Then in the post production process, massive letters tick each day by the screen as the lives at Dunkirk are at stake. Everyone's past mental scars can be seen purely by these visual decisions to enhance the feature.Unfortunately, despite the suggested idea of pressure, the meat of the pressure leans too far toward a one-sided British monarchy. Practically no representation goes to the contributors of England's condition beyond some old news footage. The screenplay by Anthony McCarten (The Theory of Everything) does show every character fighting back whatever tough challenge they started together, though you still may want to sit back a little away from the script\u2019s very bad breath. Clementine in particular has a quarter-baked subplot never resolved despite a pre-established anticipation for closure. All the other women either stay chained behind typewriters or at the husband\u2019s bedside, as if cinematic diversity just fell backwards seventy-five years.Like other hopeful Oscar contenders, the attempt to inspire here stretches too hard, especially in the final speech. It\u2019s understandable why it took on a PG-13 rating to appeal to a profitable market, although most teenagers will find it boring, while others may find it predictable, since the script\u2019s fear of national failure triggers an insignificant response from the target audience. Seriously, the potential in Darkest Hour\u2019s kite rides with the wind rather than against it.You can always count on Americans to do the right thing after they\u2019ve tried everything else, except director Joe Wright (Anna Karenina, Pride & Prejudice) lazily relies on historical news footage to establish the era, one of the several examples that demonstrates a small imagination; ironic since Wright attempts to focus in on Churchill\u2019s message of courage.Perfect World Pictures ultimately thinks striking gold will guarantee financial and critical success, with the assumption that the Oscars still set their prioritized sights on British WWII era biopics. Considering the massive change the Academy\u2019s gone through lately in terms of membership, Darkest Hour instead looks desperate alongside its winter release. Therefore, the film\u2019s inner quarrel between the past and present loses sight of the future.As a bonus, in this review, I slipped in three quotes from Winston Churchill and two quotes from Donald Trump. Can you find them?"

Avec le recul, il est incontestable qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'homme de la situation dans ces temps troubl\u00e9s et ces... heures sombres.La grande qualit\u00e9 du film qui se focalise sur le mois de mai 1940 est de montrer la d\u00e9b\u00e2cle elle-m\u00eame vue du c\u00f4t\u00e9 britannique : l'Europe de l'ouest tombe alors sous le rouleau compresseur de l'agression nazie via sa \"blitzkrieg\" stup\u00e9fiante de rapidit\u00e9 et d'efficacit\u00e9. On ne voit pourtant que tr\u00e8s peu de s\u00e9quences de guerre : les mauvaises nouvelles qui ne cessent de s'accumuler suffisent \u00e0 retranscrire cet \u00e9tat d'urgence et d'effondrement imminent... y compris apr\u00e8s l'\u00e9vacuation r\u00e9ussie de Dunkerque.C'est une chose que le film de Christopher Nolan n'a jamais r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 rendre dans son \"Dunkerque\" d'ailleurs. Le Royaume-Uni se retrouve donc isol\u00e9 face \u00e0 l'ogre allemand avec \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque sans doute un seul homme capable de lui tenir t\u00eate, de r\u00e9sister... bien que le Premier Ministre ait quelque difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 se faire entendre dans ce gouvernement de coalition dont il a la charge...L'interpr\u00e9tation de Gary Oldman y est pour beaucoup ; on sait l'acteur tr\u00e8s dou\u00e9 et tout ce maquillage n'\u00e9tait \u00e0 mon avis pas n\u00e9cessaire mais apr\u00e8s tout, cela rajoute encore \u00e0 ce portrait criant de v\u00e9rit\u00e9. On peut regretter du coup qu'on ne suive pas Churchill pendant toute la guerre, de m\u00eame que son pass\u00e9 ne soit qu'\u00e0 peine abord\u00e9 ou \u00e9voqu\u00e9.La s\u00e9quence dans le m\u00e9tro est certainement de trop par son caract\u00e8re surr\u00e9aliste et ressemble davantage \u00e0 une vision de la \"communication\" de notre \u00e9poque qu'on a maladroitement plaqu\u00e9e, placard\u00e9e ici via un agenda SJW assez ridicule (mais que fait cet homme noir dans la rame de m\u00e9tro au juste ?). De m\u00eame pour la dactylo (la tr\u00e8s jolie Lily James) dont le r\u00f4le sert un autre agenda (f\u00e9ministe celui-l\u00e0) plus ou moins dissimul\u00e9.Quoi qu'il en soit, le film reste passionnant et tr\u00e8s bien fait ; il alterne la grandiloquence, le d\u00e9sarroi et l'\u00e9motion avec talent. L'esp\u00e9rance et la fiert\u00e9 aussi, celle d'un peuple inquiet mais combatif. Un peu (beaucoup) comme les si beaux discours de Winston Churchill en somme."

      "text": "This movie will makes people think of Lincoln, but also the Dunkirk movie. The performance of Oldman is by far amazing, inspiring. And his portrait of Churchill is human and touching. The story focus on the political side of the events in Britain, and in that sens, just enough of the war is said and showed. And it does use some scenes for emotional effect, rather then historical. So no, it's not a true historic film, But it has the quality of showing how hard it was to stand as politician in a period of conflict. It put some perspective to a movie like Dunkirk. I don't know if it was intentional or an opportunistic move, but the timing is good. I give it a 78% because of Oldman and the actors around him."

OK Oldman was OK playing Churchill , but did he really mumble that much? It was drab , unimaginative , overrated , & a waste of time. Will watch it when insomnia kicks in ! It's a huge dissapontment!"

      "text": "\u201cDarkest Hour\u201d stars Gary Oldman, was written by Anthony McCarten and was directed by Joe Wright. This as most know is the story of the early days of World War II as Great Britain struggled with the results of the appeasement stratagies of Neville Chamberain, his fall from grace and the appointment of Winston Churchill as his successor who led his country and the Allies to a victory over Nazi Germany. But more than anything, it is the vehicle in which Mr. Oldman is given the opportunity of an actor\u2019s lifetime to play Mr. Churchill so convincingly that the film becomes more like a documentary rather than a fictionalized version of what took place in Europe in the days preceding Britain\u2019s entry into the war. I give the film an 8  based mostly on Mr. Oldman\u2019s portrayal of Mr. Churchill but also because of the interesting and informative manner in which the film is presented."

Yet film's authors invented several fictional\u00a0episodes that never happened to make it look even more dramatic.I do not want to spoil it for you but the movie should not be taken as \"this is how it happened in 1940\", only to some degree. Gary Oldman playing Winston Churchill deserves Oscar nomination.Director Joe Wright made the whole film a bit too stagy and theatrical\u00a0for my taste.Overall, the movie is interesting to watch, especially for people who know little about that time in history, particularly in history of WWII."

      "text": "I think we can all come to the conclusion that Gary Oldman is a great character actor, the likes of which may only be seen once within our lifetime and that is performance as Prime Minister Winston Churchill is yet another testament to this fact. However that being said the Darkest hour by itself is a fairly dull and otherwise boring film. Now i went into this film fairly blind per say, i didn't watch any trailers but as a self-described scholar of World War II history i had a fairly rough idea of where the film would go and for the most part I was correct and dissatisfied with what i saw. To put it bluntly this film is nothing more than senseless propaganda, as in the saluting the American flag to Star-Spangled Banner kind of propaganda that you're typically subjected to in just about every Hollywood war flick. My main problem with is film is the mainstreamed story for the sake of creating a plot arc for the character of Winston Churchill rather than the historical Winston Churchill. But I suppose in that being said a historical based film mocking the ineptitude of one histories most weakest military leaders wouldn't make for good ticket sales. But to where credit is due the film does make fair reference to the Gallipoli campaign from WWI a colossal failure on the part of Churchill. In the end the film plays out in typical narrative function hero rises, hero loses, hero redeems himself, hero saves the day which you'll no doubt see countless times this year.History aside the film is otherwise pretty 'meh' and forgettable even now two days on, i'm a hard time recalling what is saw. The film establishes its need pretty early on for flashy set pieces and there there enough pretty props to satisfy everyone's belief that film takes place during the second world war from the streets of Britain to Churchill's Bunker and while it's nice it doesn't help the fact that the story is pretty weak. Direction overall is pretty average too, and going back across trailers and posters Joe Wrights name is plastered all over them whose claim to fame includes 'Atonement' a decent film and 'Pan' yes that sh*tty Peter Pan film released in 2015. So if this film attempted to build hype train around his name then i certainly wasn't getting on board.Aside from potentially becoming the film that will give Gary Oldman his long awaited Oscar I can't see much point in recommending or otherwise watching this film again. Performances are decent, Oldmans a standout, direction is average and the plot is a propaganda driven mess that i wouldn't mind if it weren't so boring."
