Almost everything about it was awful. It feels like a group of interns wrote, directed and produced this lackluster catastrophe. It was so bad I almost walked out last night. From the bad acting, cringy dialogue, annoying stupid poorly written forgettable characters and their questionable decisions, CGI so bad that it looks like it's from a 2010-2013 alien video game cut scene, action scenes so boring and full of mindless explosions that it feels as if it's a bad Michael Bay film. Not to mention it's terrible pacing and a plot that's so all over the place the movie itself doesn't seem to realize what is. The jokes are so immature and unoriginal. I laughed at a few of them, but most of them seem like some 10 year old high acid said them. Hell even kids probably won't find this amusing. I found myself cheering for The Predator to kill all the characters and walk away with the boy. It would've been for the best, because his father the a dumbass.

The film wreaks of meddling, studio and test audiences.Due to the re-shoots, there's plenty of barely finished CGI and it's hard to get too invested in some of the action sequences when the VFX look straight out of 'Star Trek Generations' and some creature CG that's borderline as bad as the VFX in 'An American Werewolf in Paris'. But, those were mid-90's movies, not a major release in 2018.It's not just the rushed CG, the re-shoots have taken their toll and crippled the film both structurally and narratively, it's an absolute cluster mess, overflowing with pacing issues, tonal imbalances, massive continuity issues and plot holes.

Then the movie plays out like John Carpenter\u2019s Halloween where they all drive around town searching for the Predator on Halloween with all the kids out trick or treating, and then they send in incompetent government agents.The script doesn\u2019t make much sense with a lot of continuity errors, and I don\u2019t know if it is due to a problem with poor editing, but it feels quite disjointed in places. The scientist in one scene finds out who the sniper was that had first contact with the Predator, but then she is running for her life, and meets the sniper and says she already read his file.  Like, no she didn\u2019t.  She never even had a chance to see it.  At another point the group of misfit service members, which they refer to themselves as the loonies are in a woman\u2019s house, and then you see them spread out in various vehicles driving around town including a police car with the sirens going.  Like, what?  Or later when they randomly show up at the perfect time with a News helicopter.  Where did they get the vehicles from? They also magically have a lot of military grade firearms including grenade launchers, assault rifles with silencers, and mp5s.  Yet they never had access to any of it.  When a Predator says he is hunting them then the groups of people that were killing each other suddenly became allies without any hesitancy whatsoever, which was ridiculous.  Oh, and the Scientist lady turned out to have special forces combat skills, which also was not believable.Some of the deductions like from the military intelligence officer who deduced what the Predators were doing was too far-fetched.  No way he could have deduced all that on the info he had, but serves as a lazy way for exposition.  The Scientist who figures out what the Predators are up to on each planet by just looking at their blood in a microscope is also crazy far-fetched.  No way she could deduce that.  Also serves as exposition, and there were other moments equally as far-fetched.  The young kid with autism who liked around 9 was also some kind of genius at being able to immediately know how to use the alien technology.  This didn\u2019t make any sense.A VA facility would not be where they take the Predator to conduct tests, and the security would have been much better since they know they have an alien that is very deadly with a lot of strength as they make references to the Predators in previous movies.  They know what they are capable of.  It is also highly convenient that the soldier that makes first contact with the alien happens to be in the same VA facility.  Not to mention, how convenient it was that the soldier was on a secret mission to rescue hostages in the jungle where the alien\u2019s escape pod happened to land just as he was about to engage in his mission.The movie has a lot of tonal problems too.  It seems like it is meant to be a sci-fi action horror, which makes sense, but it also tries to be a comedy at times, and the attempts at humor feels so out of place, and cringe.  I can\u2019t tell if it is trying to be an intentional satire or not.  The group of misfit soldiers are terribly out of place with one guy with tourettes as if he is meant to be the comic relief, and their interactions with one another is just irritating with some slapstick comedy.  The scientist that joins them also seems to act out of character at times in a very disjointed way.And, the CGI was not a good idea for the Predator, and looks like they were jumping on the Marvel bandwagon.  The acting was pretty poor apart from the lead guy, and woman whom were decent and some of the action sequences were decent, but not much else."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "I think it is watchable but also the weakest in the Predator franchise. It mostly lacks the feeling of fear and dread the other movies have and the story should be a bit more ironed out. I also dislike the stuff they add to the lore which weakens the franchise in my opinion. The previous movie was actually pretty good so I was hoping this would be equally good too. The story starts with a squad of the US army on a mission in Mexico against a drug cartel when a strange flying object crashes nearby. For the sniper Quinn it is the start of a strange adventure he never would have imagined in his wildest dreams or nightmares. I am vague to avoid spoilers. The first few minutes are excellent but it did get weaker fast. It is never as intense as the previous movies. They lack the dread, fear and menace. To be fair it as its moments but the story in total is a missed opportunity. A lot is not used well and if it were on DVD I would fast forward a lot. Also the additions to the lore weaken the franchise. A lot of the appeal was that the predators were mysterious. Here they answer some questions but the answers are disappointing. There / Those are also WTF moments like the instant understanding of technology, the upgrade stuff and the Predator using verbal exposition to name those I think are harmful. I like the cast even if nothing cant top the first Predators cast. The lead role by Boyd Holbrook works but is also the weakest lead character in the franchise. His squad consisting of actors Alfie Allen, Augusto Aguilera, Thomas Jane, Trevante Rhodes and Keagan Michael Keys. They are fully to my liking and I enjoyed them a lot. Special praise to Jacob Tremblay as there are not many good child actors and I think Yvonne Strahovski and Olivia Munn are also good. We have a really good cast in my humble opinion. The special effects were fine for me. Not the gold standard but convincing. Overall I repeat that this movie is not intense and scary enough by franchise standards. It is worthwhile but not amazing. Weakest movie in the franchise and some of the new lore I will ignore.

I like the original a lot, I haven\u2019t seen the second one, Alien vs Predator is a guilty pleasure of mine, I haven\u2019t seen the second one, and I thought Predators was okay. As for The Predator, it was definitely a bad movie, but I actually thought it was pretty funny. A lot of the intentional Marvel-style humour fell pretty flat for me, but there\u2019s another aspect of the film that I found pretty hilarious. One of the main characters is an autistic kid, but he\u2019s movie autistic. He\u2019s shy, he gets bullied and he can\u2019t handle loud noises (except for explosions apparently?), but he\u2019s actually a genius. Pretty stereotypical portrayal. Mary & Max and Ready Player One did it a lot better. What makes it hilarious is how they use his autism as a plot device. How can he figure out how to use the Predator technology? Autism. Why is the Predator after him? Also autism. Why? Get this. They are using humans to make super-powerful hybrid Predators and one of them wants to use the power of autism to make them even stronger. Yes, you heard that right, the Predator wants to weaponize autism. But that\u2019s not all! There\u2019s also an environmental message and a cute animal sidekick! I swear, I\u2019m not making any of this up! This movie\u2019s plot is insane! As for the rest of the movie, it was honestly nothing special at all. It\u2019s pretty much just a generic action movie.

The Predator is a simple concept, and the audience for this kind of film just wants simple things: An alien who is an intergalactic hunter for sport or whatever. Yet, they had to throw everything that only troubled the plot, straying from the only reason anyone would ever want to watch this.Starting by the character of the boy in this movie, it's just wrong. It's just glorifing a disorder. Asperger is not a 'superpower' to make 12yo understand alientech. This felt like a wrong depiction of the condition in a bad way, was silly all the way and required some suspension of disbelief to continue. The fact that the entire plot depends on it so much makes this a bad movie. The entire plot gathers around this more and more, which makes the suspension of disbelief incleasingly harder. By the end of the movie they just added so much unnecessary content that convoluted the plot and disturbed the audience's first motivation so much, that I just preffer to think it to think this movie does not count start with. A giant predator felt so misplaced. It would be so much more more interesting if it was another regular predator. There could much more intense and remarkable scenes between two predator fighting then seeing a giant predator destroy the regular one, effotlessly. It felt lazy and lame. A predator puppy.It even has the bangs. How can anyone not get out of immersion when there is a predator puppy? With predator bangs for good reason?And of plain and simple enviromental alarmism out of nowhere (it's defenitely alarmism when you say the world ends in two generations).Now, Balancing the nice looking predator with these awful aspects, there's almost nothing to keep one's interest. Add to it the all so exausting \"last second\" cliche taken to exaustion. It breaks the movie for me, really.Making a predator story is not so hard, you just have to keep it simple, small, localized and broad enough to turn it into a connected universe.

I didn't set my expectations very high and wasn't expecting this to eclipse the brilliance and effectiveness of the original film, but it is a crying shame that this film could not even claw its way over the low bar of expectations I had set for it.The movie surprisingly started out interestingly enough and I found myself enjoying it throughout the first two acts - but it is when the \"Upgrade Predator\" arrives on scene where the movie quickly devolves into a sloppy and incoherent mess with gaping potholes larger than a crater left by a downed predator ship.Overall I find this movie to be the unfortunate victim of too much test screening, too many changes and re-shoots, and an overabundance of bad creative decisions by the writers. The film relies on too many (inexplicably incompetent) nameless commandos as cannon-fodder to notch up a large body count, the CGI kills look cheap and shoddy,and the stakes feel way too low when the emotional weight during key scenes is sacrificed in favor of cheap laughs.

I love predator, I'm a total fan boy, and i want them to keep making predator movies till the end of time. but fox needs to hit the reset button on this franchise and let someone who is smart, passionate, and a fan take the wheel and get the hell out of the way. there is so much creative freedom to be had in the alien and predator universe, its shameful that this is what they come up with."}], "recommendations": ["alien_resurrection", "transformers_age_of_extinction", "jurassic_world_fallen_kingdom", "predators", "war_of_the_worlds", "skyline", "the_darkest_hour", "battleship", "geostorm", "the_tomorrow_war", "jurassic_world_dominion", "transformers_the_last_knight", "legion", "army_of_the_dead", "teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles", "riddick", "independence_day_resurgence", "shadow_in_the_cloud", "transformers_revenge_of_the_fallen", "doomsday", "jurassic_world", "the_meg", "pacific_rim_uprising", "underworld_blood_wars", "district_9"]}
