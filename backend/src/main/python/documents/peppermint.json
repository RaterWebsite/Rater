      "text": "Peppermint is an action thriller which tells the story of young mother Riley North (Jennifer Garner) who awakens from a coma after her husband and daughter are killed in a brutal attack on the family. When the system frustratingly shields the murderers from justice, Riley sets out to transform herself from citizen to urban guerilla. Channeling her frustration into personal motivation, she spends years in hiding honing her mind, body and spirit to become an unstoppable force - eluding the underworld, the LAPD and the FBI - as she methodically delivers her personal brand of justice"

      "text": "Jennifer Garner is an Avenging Angel of Death Serving Justice with a M-16.Jennifer Garner goes from a suburban \u201cGirl Scout mom\u201d to bad ass gun toting assassin, Riley North, on a mission to kill anyone involved the murder of her family. You probably know Jennifer Garner from her Capital One commercials or her overly publicized three-year divorce proceedings from rehabbed Ben Affleck.  Yet, not too long ago she was Sidney Bristow, a sexy undercover spy, in J.J. Abrams\u2019 Alias. Or you might remember her as the beautiful sword swinging ninja assassin-for-hire in Marvel\u2019s Elecktra? In Peppermint, Jennifer Garner returns with a vengeance. Riley\u2019s super cute 9-year-old daughter (Cailey Fleming \u2013 Star Wars: The Force Awakens) and handsome husband (Jeff Hephner \u2013 Interstellar) are in the movie just long enough to for you to fall in love with them and becomes outraged when they are machine gunned down by the L.A. Mexican drug cartel while innocently eating peppermint ice cream cones at the Carnival.   Despite Riley identification of the face tattooed killers in a line up, the corrupt judge lets them go. Enraged, Riley goes off the grid for five years hiding in L.A.\u2019s Skid Row, training and preparing to exact her revenge. Director Pierre Morel (Taken) knows action movies, and like Taken this one is no exception.  Sometimes when a movie is firing on all cylinders it is criticized for being too formulaic.  Sure, it won\u2019t win any Oscars, and this was no John Wick, but this was a fun ride of non-stop violent revenge.  While not for everybody, if you liked Death Wish, Punisher or The Equalizer, you will love Peppermint."

      "text": "Easy on the Stomach (Peppermint Review)Peppermint is not really a complex film. It's a straight forward action film that feels like a showcase for Jennifer Garner. Are there  underlying messages? Yes, and I think the film tries to be more hardcore than clever e.g. don't enable or let substance abusing take precedence over child rearing or suffer consequences. Is this film social commentary? It definitely leaves the viewer to discern then decide which is always an interesting dilemma for an audience.Vigilanteism (eh-hrm\u2026) in Peppermint is holy water against hell fire except in the confines of the legal system\u200a-\u200aillegal. Who is going to stand against systemic corruption and how? Riley and \"a very particular set of skills.\"\u00a0The film is  decent and feels like a warm-up for the lot of films releasing with female protagonists embarking on their quests of justice, righting the wrongs of evil men.Overall Grade: C+-K.D.If you're into Poetry and other bits of creativity, check out my Instagram: @Dufreshest."

      "text": "Jennifer Garner is trying her best. She succeeds in being a loving mother who after getting her world torn apart becomes a symbol of justice. Not like good justice but like a violent gun totting batman justice. It sounds weird, but I believe this works well with what they are going for. After being broken and destroyed by the system she trains for years to become a killer. I love they added this. Sometimes it`s just explained by, oh golly I forgot she was military trained back in her service years. It makes sense it takes time for her to be this way. A scared person pees themselves. THAT\u2019S REALISM. Villains when scared resort to out lash and typical things cowards do. I love all the realism like this, even how Jennifer or Riley holds all her guns make sense. There are some small details that continue. Jennifer gets stabbed and for the rest of the film that side, or leg hurts, and she shows it with every step. I love continuity. There is fluid action. It is in between the long shots of John Wick style action and quick edits like Taken 3. It is a healthy mix that is easy to follow.  Film name is weird, could have picked something else. All movement is military."

The first 5 minutes of the movie give you the idea that you are about to watch a groundbreaking (seriously, they kill the girl?), emotionally strong movie with a strong foundation and background story. However, nothing is further from the truth when Garner suddenly emerges from a five year absence as a fully combat-ready-super-assassin, with no more then a 3 second Youtube video as explanation of how she got there. The movie than goes on to bore you for another +/- 90 minutes with pretty much standard one-of action movie writing and \u201cunexpected\u201d plot twists. After having seen the trailer I was under the impression that this would finally be a one-of action movie worth watching, couldn\u2019t have been more disappointed."

I've been waiting for Peppermint to come out after seeing the trailer, bought it tonight and couldn't wait to watch it with my husband. As a 40-something soccer mom, I couldn't help but root for Riley. It was easy to empathize with her and cheer her on. This is now one of my new favorite movies.  How this has a low rating is beyond me..... I have over 1200 movies on my VUDU account (we are a bit of a movie fanatic family) and this is on my top 5 of all time favorite action movies. I've always loved Jennifer Garner, but now, I have a serious girl crush on her. She's bad ass. I signed up to Metacritic tonight, just so I could leave a review because I was so disappointed with pretentious critics who think they know what makes a good film. Don't trust the critics, this is a must see!"

There is little in the way of plot to explain the lead characters inexplicable transformation into a killing machine after the short intro- not even a montage But if you're willing to accept that there are some decent action scenes to carry you to the predictable ending. Sadly i never felt truly invested in Riley's need for revenge - i could never get behind  the emotional impact of the death of her family and the subsequent kill spree. It just felt like jennifer garner doing what she does best a la electra and alias. Despite its average all roundness this was an enjoyable watch and certainly well paced."

      "text": "I love Jennifer Garner, she is one of my favorite actresses ever, but this movie was pretty much nothing more than a feminine rip-off of The Punisher (2004). Jennifer Garner\u2019s acting was amazing in this revenge flick, but it\u2019s just not enough to save a crappy, predictable, unoriginal, generic, cliched violent by-the-numbers revenge flick. Her character is basically a feminist Punisher/Frank Castle rip-off. The only reason this movie gets a 1 is because of Jennifer Garner\u2019s amazing performance. She is a great and very talented actress, but if she wants to be an action star again, she needs to choose a much better role in an action film with a solid script. It\u2019s a damn travesty she was nominated for a Razzie for Worst Actress for her role in this movie. Her acting wasn\u2019t even bad at all! The Razzies, like the Oscars, are a BIG JOKE!!! Sometimes they nominate actors who did good acting in bad movies just because they think it\u2019s funny (even though it\u2019s never funny). They sometimes nominate an actor for being in a bad movie even if their acting wasn\u2019t bad in it. The same **** happened to Ben Affleck (who coincidentally is Jennifer Garner\u2019s ex-husband) in 2016 when he was Razzie-nominated for Worst Supporting Actor for his role in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice."

The story isn't exactly fully built on, there are unanswered questions but its pretty clear its mainly meant to be a basic action film and nothing much else. Jennifer Garner doesn't do badly as the main character, Riley North but I can't say its not cliched. There is a fair amount of bloody violence, hence the rating (15 in the UK), so I wouldn't recommend it for young teens but otherwise its ok I suppose, though nothing nothing more than that. I don't think its a memorable film, so I wouldn't particularly recommend it generally either."

In fact, this movie is better than the punisher movies (probably not the tv series). The action scenes although extreme are believable and tactical and Garner pulls it off, she\u2019s pretty bad ass!"
