It actually hits tragic proportions by the end and I love that.\r3) It's almost ridiculous that Cate Blanchett, already one of the best actors in the world prior to this movie, delivers her most iconic leading performance as Jasmine after being in the business for almost 2 decades. Naturally and deservedly she won the Oscar and broke the record for most Best Actress awards won by a single role - 42."

Blanche waits inside the apartment and has a shot of Stanley\u2019s booze--the sisters reunite and Blanche reveals some bad news--they are bankrupt. She had a bit of a break-down--Blanche is horrified that her sister is living in a dump like this one when they both come from such a wealthy, elite background. Blanche has another drink--rest assured that Blanche is either having a drink or about to have a drink at all times--Stella goes to the bathroom and Stanley enters and Blanche sees a man not good enough for her sister and too brutal for the DuBois sisters--while they chat, Blanche reveals that she was married once, but her husband died-- that night Stanley and his buddies play poker at the house. Among said buddies is Mitch, who is single.\r No, you are not watching a remake of \u201cA Streetcar Named Desire\u201d or a filming of Cate Blanchett's  Blanche, that she played on stage to resounding success. You are watching a modern Woody Allen  version called \u201cBlue Jasmine\u201d but unfortunately Allen is not the poet and lover of words that Tennessee Williams was. Here Blanche is called Jasmine, or Jeanette, her sister Stella here called Ginger, played by Sally Hawkins, only now they are not blood sisters but both were adopted, which gives Woody Allen a chance to riff on genes! He also has a Bernie Madoff like Alec Baldwin while pointing fingers at how much did Jasmine--Ruth Madoff--know?\r Now instead of one Staney we have 3: Gingers ex, Augie (Andrew Dice Clay), her current lover Chili (Bobby Cannavale) and a possible future lover Al (Louis C.K.) while Blanche/Jasmine\u2019s gentleman caller Mitch  is called  Dwight (Peter Sarsgaard). Some more modern touches are using San Francisco instead of New Orleans, the guys watching a football game instead of playing poker, Jasmine popping Xanax and  we see Blanche\u2019s Belle Reeves in her New York life. Allen does stick to old blues songs playing a lot of the originals.\r While all the actors acquit themselves doing excellent work it is more Cate Blanchett\u2019s  movie than theirs or Woody Allen\u2019s. This is the closest we'll ever get to her stage portrayal of Blanche and, as of now, she is the forerunner for the Oscar\u2019s Best Actress award."

As usual, she's brilliant as a neurotic, upper crust New Yorker whose life falls apart when her husband's (Alec Baldwin) shady dealings cause their downfall. She travels all the way to San Francisco to move in with her hard-working sister. Even with her captivating performance, watching Blanchett cope with the realities of being broke and her sister's pedestrian taste becomes laborious. As usual, director Woody Allen has filled the cast with spot-on actors (including Sally Hawkins, Bobby Cannavale, Peter Sarsgaard), but his script is too neurotic and unpleasant.

I can't recall a better performance (or more difficult role) by any actress in recent years; yes, it really is that good (prepare to be awed!). It's Woody Allen's best movie in quite a long time. This was a very tricky film to pull off; credit the faultless cast and Mr. Allen's direction for crafting such a compelling and successful production given the extremely complicated relationship of it's subject matter and tone. On this last point, moviegoers must be aware that although the film is filled with continual humor and comedy, the underlying story is very dark and unsettling. That said, it's not standard Hollywood film fare in the best possible way. There is no predictable story or narrative here; you never feel entirely comfortable with the characters or where the film will take you next."

In fact, while watching \"Blue Jasmine\", I was struck with the feeling that almost every character in this movie was somewhat imaginary. I kept thinking, \"This is not how a person from this background in this situation would respond or behave\", there was always something disturbingly off kilter in nearly every scene. It felt like a play, a two dimensional play.\rCate Blanchett is a terrific actress and it's something to see as she tries to spackle her past outwardly while desperately failing to reconcile her conscious inwardly. Almost everything else is garbage. Your demographic for this movie goes like this: White, Affluent, Insular, Educated, and mostly in\rRetirement. Woody Allen knows this audience and, in my opinion, very little else. Clams in San Francisco? Dear Lord, did no one whisper into the emperor's ear that crab is what we eat here? Stupid example yes, but the entire movie has dumb moments like that. But details matter.\rCall me an idiot, but I did not even know what this movie was or that Woody directed it, furthermore, I didn't pick up on the fact that this was a retelling of Streetcar. I really can't tell you how that passed me off. The writer and director of this movie is a putz. Such good actors, such a great city to set it in, such a lot of money; Such an insipid waste."

      "text": "Baldwin and Blanchett are wonderful. The rest of the cast is good, too. The problem with this Woody Allen film is the incomplete story. Jasmine's exploration of life at the dentist's office, with the budding politician, her son or even her husband  each ends without much discovery of something bigger than the sum of the action. She dumps the dentist, gets dumped by her husband, gets dumped by the politician... and that's kind of it. The politician dumps her simply because he finds out, in one chance bumping into a character that informs him of Jasmine's lies about her former life. That mechanism for moving forward in the story is a bit weak. There's nothing emotional for the audience to grasp onto to buy into it. It's just information. The politician could have acted any number of ways and we are non the wiser as to why  his character and relationship with Jasmine isn't developed in that way. Ebert used to complain about this kind of script where characters just announce what they're feeling or going to do, rather than have it unfold as story. There are many other instances of this kind of storytelling. However, the potentials for a great Woody Allen movie are lurking throughout. Baldwin's character seems even to be more dimensional and nuanced than even Blanchett's though both have great characters to portray. I wish Allen would have dispensed with the San Francisco travelogue (yes, he's guilty of characters ending up in iconic places that seem to go against their probably natural geography... ending up in South Park near downtown, wtf) and stayed in New York to develop Baldwin's character and story in all it's complex contradictions. Instead of Blanchett telling about her embarrassment selling shows to her high society friends, it would have been more bittersweet, funny and sad to have actually seen that, rather than her and the dentist."

I felt this hit a nerve about where we are in society today and what we are looking for   and how we get and lose what is most important.

      "text": "\u201cBlue Jasmine\u201d is the latest submission by writer-director Woody Allen. It stars Alec Baldwin,, Cate Blanchett, Peter Sarsgaard, Sally Hawkins and Bobby Cannavale in this story of a character strangely resembling  Bernie Madoff (Alec B) and his wife (Cate B) as they seek to function after the fall. Intermixed with this basic plot is the plight of Ginger, the sister of the Mrs. Madoff-like character and her boyfriend (Bobby V) who so much resemble Stella and Stanley Kowalski in \u201cStreetcar Named Desire\u201d than probably even Mr. Allen would care to acknowledge. The characters are flawed and yet we never go further than skin deep in this commentary by the author and the need for tranquilizers and relaxers as our heroine faces life after luxury. The first really non-comedy from Mr. Allen since Interiors in the 80;s, I was disappointed in the product. Although certainly easy to view, the film lacks depth and tells us really nothing about what we are watching. I wonder if the many critics who are falling all over their pens to praise and acknowledge this work would be doing so if the author and director had a different name. I remember years ago that going to an Ingmar Bergman movie automatically meant you either loved it or didn\u2019t understand it  It was heresy to criticize it or not give it a rave review. So, at the risk of heresy and incurring the wrath of the Allen fan club members, I give this film a 7 because I truly expected so much more but never got it."

Every now and then a current event triggers a memory flash from her past life, and that is how we learn what brought her to the shabby state she currently finds herself. There are numerous faults in the script (written by Woody Allen as well). Plus over-all the movie leaves some clownish aftertaste (which is not unusual for his movies).

None of the dialogue rings true, even the direction is bad and Woody, you are stealing the basic premise of Streetcar Named Desire and butchering it.  Why people are showering praise on this pile of crap is stunning.  The actors do a valiant job of trying to bring some truth to this dung heap but nobody could.  Louis C.K.  can write and direct circles around what Woody is doing now and is totally wasted in this.  People walk up to characters in this and spout dialogue that no one would say and no one who has a brain or taste can possible think this is good.  The only explanation must be that because of what Woody has done in the past and the controversy surrounding him now, which by the way I do not care about, has made people support his work no matter what  but this is possibly his worst movie ever.Stop making movies Woody, enjoy the accolades of the past and let better writers and directors take your place, Louie for one and let us love and remember you at your best, this is movie is far from that."

      "text": "I prefer to live on a wavelength unfrequented by the masses. So it makes sense that I'd enjoy most Woody Allen films; films that are strange in that very familiar way. His characters are portrayals of us or people we know  magnified to the extreme degree. He's the master of balance, paying equal attention to the shocking and tedium bits that make life such an interesting (and often painful) adventure.\r Blue Jasmine  his most recent film  plays with this idea of balance. A rather dramatic and shocking premise (Jasmine's husband kills himself while imprisoned for fraud) tempered by an exploration of what it's like to be painfully middle class (Jasmine is forced to redefine success, which prior to her husband's suicide meant multi-million dollar homes, the fanciest of clothes, and vacations in Saint-Tropez). It's also a too-close-for-comfort character study of Jasmine (played by Blanchett)  we literally watch the fabric of her being unravel like a pathetically pretty doily.\r Blue Jasmine is a deep sea dive into the frighteningly wild and unpredictable sea of Jasmine's emotions. Despite her beauty and timelessly elegant style, we learn that the only thing to have ever lived beneath her gorgeous facade was a manikin of wealth and power. When her husband's fraudulent money-making schemes are punished and Jasmine's left with nothing but her chanel accessories, she realizes how empty her life has become; and how, until now, she's never had to lift a finger to fill it.\r Faced with this sudden challenge, we witness Jasmine's unraveling. She seems to sweat profusely in every scene (somehow beautiful despite massive pit stains and greasy hair). Her stoli-vodka martini trembles in her anxious hand, as she tries to make a life for herself while living with her adopted sister Ginger, working as a receptionist for a dentist, and going back to school to learn how to use a computer so she can start an interior design business of her own.\r As the film continues to explore Jasmine's discomfort with the work required to be a self-sustaining adult and the lack of reward for doing so, I couldn't help but feel that this was a story about me; about the extraordinarily average life I lead. But through Jasmine's unraveling, I felt less and less wooed by the idea of \"making it big\" or having stuff. Regardless of the facade  be it a chanel belt or vacations in Saint-Tropez  we're all essentially the same  up manikin trying our damnedest to hold our  together behind the scenes.\r Allen continues to make thought-provoking films with beautiful women in it. I loved this one, and Blanchett surely deserves an award for it."

There was nothing realistic about it Blue Jasmine..and that's because it was an unintended parody on what life might be like for a  new divorcee who got bit by a Madoff style scheme gone Federal.   Oh poor pitiful Jasmine/Jeanette.  Who cares?!?!?!?!  No one cares.   it's been done so many different ways.  Was it well acted?  It was overacted by Kate Blanchett with a forced Manhattan Elite American accent.   The only scenes I liked involved Louis CK's Al Munsinger character.  Well done, Woody.   Anytime you can cast the likes of Louie CK, you've done well. I should rate this film a 2 instead of a 1 just for that, but i won't.   Do us all a favor, Woodster.  Go back to making ridiculous comedies like \"Bananas\"   You're unmatched in that genre.  And drop the clarinet-laden art house wannabe flicks.  Leave them to the French.   They know how to make the films you're attempting to puzzle together."

While this movie has a passing resemblance to A Streetcar Named Desire, it is more nuanced, more complex, more layered, and more convincing. Unbelievable script and performances. This film deserves at least two Oscars, for script and best actress. And it hinges on no amusing gimmick. No time travel. No man stepping out of a movie screen. No hypnotist. No gangsters cursing one another under the influence of helium. Just excellent pure focused tight drama. See it."

This film is a throwback to the great 80's films of his like \"Interiors\" and \"Another Woman\".  Cate Blanchett is mesmerizing as a woman who has lived in a bubble, and cannot face the real world.  She is only comfortable in her unrealistic world as the wealthy trophy wife, and cannot function when the marriage tragically ends.  The supporting cast is superb, but this is Cate Blanchett's vehicle to take all the way to the Oscars.  LOVED the ending as well.  Perfection."

For a vanity-ridden, insolvent, over-the-hill trophy wife widow who just lost her fraudulent husband (who committed suicide in the prison) and desperately looks for an eligible replacement to get her upper-class life back on track in a Woody Allen\u2019s film, it is not congruent with Cate\u2019s majestic poise which we all kneel over, naturally I will be head over heels if she wins, but this year, my heart goes to Dame Judi Dench in PHILOMENA (2013), how often does the Academy honor the senior leading ladies? And no one deserves more than Dench among her peers, while Cate is at her prime and tons of opportunities await ahead.\r Digress back to BLUE JASMINE, Allen returns to his homeland and the film is set at San Francisco, Jasmine (Blanchett) forfeited all her properties and bank savings after the passing of her husband\u2019s Hal (Baldwin), returns to live with her sister Ginger (Hawkins), who is a working-class divorc\u00e9e with 2 children. There are clashes between Jasmine and Ginger\u2019s fianc\u00e9 Chili (Cannavale), and a past wrangle of losing Ginger and her ex-husband Augie (Clay)\u2019s lottery money scars the harmony between the sisters too.\r The bumpy road of Jasmine\u2019s readjustment into the new life style commingles with Jasmine\u2019s high-end good old days, which grants Blanchett a full gamut of theatrical flexibility to sculpt a rather unsympathetic character from all possible (negative) angles, her shallowness, neuroticism, maliciousness, phoniness, obnoxiousness are all over the place, especially when the revelation unfolds near the end, what\u2019s the odds for a wealthy wife to inform on her husband after discovering his chronic out-of-wedlock affairs? Not in real life but in Allen\u2019s wishful thinking script, Once she grabs her status, it is no way she will squander everything out of a passion of betrayal, it is something every trophy wife should have learned by heart, what\u2019s more unconvincing is that Blanchett can never be that stupid. A paralleled subplot of Ginger\u2019s flirtation with a better suitor vehemently hints that things are not better for those lower class dreamers, reality bites.\r The non-American Blanchett and Hawkins master in their American accent, Blanchett can never disappoint us, even under the most wretched situation, she is fiery and undefeated like a lioness will never capitulate. Meanwhile I\u2019m more complacent for Hawkins\u2019 hard-earned Oscar nomination, what a unique character actress she is, innocuous but vibrant with driving forces. Also an unsung hero among the cast is Cannavale, juggles with the siblings as the unsophisticated blue-collar labourer, who can be so blatant to snide at Jasmine\u2019s ruin and question her faults and so volatile when going frantic with Ginger\u2019s lapse and totally smitten with her when she retreats back to him.\r Disregarding the overstated hubbub with A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE (1951, 9/10), BLUE JASMINE is not Allen\u2019s top-tier output, the script is far less from award-worthy and a satirical comedy, but its friendly orange tinge and eclectic jazz ditties could accompany you for a lazy high tea time with Jasmine babbling about her delusions of grandeur, life is comprised of continuous dramas, so just let\u2019s laugh about it."

      "text": "You can keep your Annie Hall's, Manhattan and Midnight in Paris. This is the best Woody Allen film in years and it's all because of the magnificent Cate Blanchett. Yes, she's back and HOW in a performance to savour that must rank as the best in any Allen film. What about Diane Keaton I hear you ask. Diane Keaton! Don't make me laugh, well actually she didn't! There are simply not enough superlatives to praise Blanchett's playing of this wonderfully multi dimensional and complex woman. The last time I can remember seeing such a delightful and off beat female character on screen was way back in 1987 when Holly Hunter presented us with her controlling TV producer Jane Craig in Broadcast News. Another performance to relish. Whether popping pills, talking to herself or rejecting suitors Cate is joyous whilst looking absolutely fantastic into the bargain.\r In all honesty Allen's screenplay, whilst dramatically very good, is not particularly funny. The comedy is elicited by Blanchett's delicate playing and her expressions from scene to scene. Her escape from the clutches of the amorous dentist has to be seen to be appreciated and she makes it laugh out loud funny. There are no two ways about it she steals the show. Sally Hawkins does well in her role as the sister and of the men Andrew Dice Clay registers the best as Hawkins' ex-husband. But it is Cate all the way. Academy make up for your mistakes of yester year with the likes of Paltrow, Berry and Bullock and crown a true talent best actress. Yes, give her the oscar."

      "text": "Maestro Allen (and by this point it's an honorific well-earned) has infused elements of Streetcar Named Desire and Long Day's Journey into Day into this dark comic reflection of the impact of a serial narcissist on everyone around her.\rCate Blanchette's creation of a woman so blinkered by her own needs she can't see around the corners of her own despair is achingly funny and alternately tragic.  We know this soul.  We all have a touch of her within ourselves (hopefully abated by an ability to bring the needs of others into equal measure with our own.)\rFew directors strike and hold a pitch-perfect note of tragicomedy like Woody Allen; if some of his works are inspired by those dramatists and filmmakers who have so profoundly influenced him over the decades  (Bergman, Fellini, et al.) Woody has processed their themes through a piercing lens of his own and given us a stark insight into the 21st century malady of self-absorption.\rNo less touching or amazing is the persistently underrated Sally Hawkins as the sister with the \"bad genes\"; she may not love herself as much as we hope she will, but she knows how to to live in her own skin and when the realities of this life ultimately take sway over the fantasies of our youth she able to make a stand.  Like Stella Kowalski, she may go from one Stanley to another (really more of a \"Mitch\" in this case) but she will taste the richness of life and be surrounded by love.   Conversely, Jasmine must ultimately be enveloped by her delusions until the final exit door slips quietly shut and leaves her in a shining void in which she is Empress in her fantasia realm of self-importance.\r * *Spoiler alert**  read no further if you haven't seen it!  Meditate on Jasmine's next stop after that park bench at the end.  The street?  Another hospital?  Another series of willing victims?   I love that Mr. Allen lets us decide for ourselves."

      "text": "Blue Jasmine is Woody Allen's strongest female character since Annie Hall. Part Greek tragedy, part morality play, Allen applies his traditional theme of infidelity to the perils of today's financial markets, with more dramatic than comedic effect. Cate Blanchett excels at the dual persona Jasmine, establishing herself as the front runner for next year's Oscar for Best Actress. Departing from his lighter, more nostalgic recent efforts, Allen's Blue Jasmine is similar to that of Shadows and Fog, exploring the darker aspects of human character, specifically, inaction in the face of injustice. Not to be missed, catch it in the theater. Blue Jasmine is also a welcome addition to your Blu Ray collection."

      "text": "Woody Allen is a director who sometimes hits the target and sometimes shoots his own feet. However, he never fails to be interesting and innovative. Here, he will try to make his own vision about the famous movie \"A Street Car Named Desire\". The story is similar: Jasmine is a very wealthy housewife who has to say goodbye to all when her husband is arrested for tax fraud and the IRS takes almost everything that belonged to the couple to pay off debts and taxes. So, the former millionaire is forced to return to her poor family, who lives an ordinary life that she despises. To make matters worse, she is psychologically decompensated and had a nervous breakdown.The film uses very well the charm and elegance of Cate Blanchett, who plays the protagonist role in an extraordinary way. Her interpretation is so good that is reason enough to watch. Beside her, a number of good supporting actors gives her even more room to shine. The highlight goes, of course, to Alec Baldwin, Andrew Dice Clay and Sally Hawkins, the latter in the role of Jasmine's sister. The film addresses, in essence, the relationships between these characters, and the way they both try to manage their lives. The ending is a bit sudden, perhaps even sad in that the main character is totally displaced, in the midst of a world that does not understand her and which her does not seem prepared to accept. Finally, a note of approval for the soundtrack, based on jazz and blues, full of elegance and that seems to point to the psyche of the title character."

The character is interesting and relatable enough as it is but Cate's performance makes it even better. Cate does a wonderful job with the material given to her especially when she has to get angry and/or upset. Defintely deserved her Oscar nomination for Best Actress. Film buffs and adults should definitely check this one out. Everyone else see if you want but you may be bored."
