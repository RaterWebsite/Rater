      "text": "It's fun to see a film that with its own title, unknowingly lends itself to the joke that a lot of people will use in their reviews, because for all intents and purposes this was a dud. Apart from its excessive duration, its biggest problem is its lack of conviction and it's not that the atmosphere and the tone have been a waste, however both never manage to be convincing and if you're trying to sell a monster, it has to be convincing no matter what. Perfect trifecta of irrelevant beings with Slenderman and The Bye Bye Man."

No scene carries any consequences from previous scenes.  It's like a channel surfing eight year-old wrote it."

      "text": "Criminally underrated, \"The Empty Man\" is epic and visionary, existential horror dialed to 11. This is without doubt one of the creepiest movies I've ever seen.  Don't let the title fool you, or if you are going to think about it terms of other \"... Man\" films, think \"The Wicker Man\", because that's the only one worthy of being mentioned in the same breath.The never ending loop of expanding and contracting possibilities, experiences and visualizations that are established in the nightmare logic of the film will rattle your bones and make \"your brain itch\". The sound design is stunning and terrifying....like it was piped in directly from hell itself.The film went through quite a difficult process to get released, and terrible marketing choices (and trailer) took a toll, but ratings average will surely continue to increase over time as it finds the audience it was actually intended for. This is a guaranteed to be a future monster cult hit. \"The Empty Man\" has a very high rewatchability factor...it's a film that will invite and hold up to multiple viewings....if you like deep horror, get one in as soon as possible!"

      "rating": "7",
      "text": "I feel this got negative reviews early on because 20th Century had no idea how to market it. It\u2019s a 2.5 hour mainstream horror film that is both cliche and ambitious. Worth your time if you like the Midsommar-type horror films that emphasize atmosphere over jump scares."

The Empty Man did a good job at making the movie interesting with its plot. I would recommend watching this movie. Is by no means a terrible movie. A solid 7/10 from me"
