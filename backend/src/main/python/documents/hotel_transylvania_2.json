If anything the film reveals that Gendy is far better suited for handdrawn animation. His efforts to bring his techniques from 2-d to 3-d are appreciated but some things are better kept in their own medium.

Honestly, I was expecting something worse, but I was surprised at the end. Yes it has its flaws, but this film is still the fun, pleasant family film everyone came here to see. Though I personally thought the original was still better, I would still recommend this film. It just got off to a strong start, and then it started to drag. But in the middle of all this, Adam Sandler managed to pun some family jokes into the film, and like the summer movie, Minions, many children were laughing in the audience.

Drac's second adventur is a lot of fun, but a little more directed to the children this around, having some more cliche moments and messages, though it never gets boring, with things always coming up and fast reaction following them, i would say this movie is a certain good for you and anyone you take with you"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "It improve's on the original in every way.

Everything looks gorgeous and moves with a fluidity even some of the best looking of animated movies would have trouble pulling off. Everyone involved does fantastic voice work and really bring their characters to life.\r The return to this unique and goofy monster filled world is one worth watching. There's enough humor here to please any member of the family no matter what their age is. Kids are going to eat it up and parents are going to find plenty of laughs to share with them along the way.

The message about to change and to adapt in order to fit oneself into a new environment is well simplified to cater children's understanding while the eye popping, colorful visual effects together with pop styles emerging into the story are well crafted to make young adults feel like kids.

Drac's daughter marries a mortal and they have a son. Of course, grandpa (Adam Sandler) wants the kid to be a vampire, but will he? The energy never lags and the dialogue zips by. Unfortunately, most of it isn't especially clever or funny. The movie is crammed with wacky characters (played by a big cast of comic actors) and some of them are entertaining.

You know, some animated movies come and go unnoticed, so I believed it would be one of those. In fact, I did not like the first film much, that is the reason to watch it so delayedly and with a minimum expectation. Better late than never, well, I regret for viewing it so late. One of the best animation of 2015, maybe in the top 10 or 15.\r Well, it was a one liner, like, the daughter wants to move to the human social world thinking that might do good for her son's future. But her father plan to stop her getting away from him and the hotel. So those attempts are the rest of the movie. I liked the movie very much because it was very funny, especially the lines were and its accent, Adam Sandler nailed it.\r I have said millions of times that I don't know why Americans and critics hate Adam Sandler that much, I don't know about the rest of the world but I kind of like his films. The last few films like 'The Cobbler', 'Pixel', 'Men, Women & Children' and this one were so much better. It did not bring the old Sandler, but brought us a different and new Sandler on screen. He was definitely the main reason for this film's success.\r Don't just a book by its cover, well, here the cover is the previous installment. The first part was not a must see IMPO, but this is especially for the animated movie fans. PG rated movie, but still it might scare mildly for below 8 kids, only because of the theme. I had a great time with it and expecting it to do the same impact on you as well. And I can't predict the third will be as lucky as this one, lets wait and see.\r 8/10"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "It isn't as hilarious or as polished (for an kids movie) as the first one, but this is still a solid, crisply animated family flick.

I had a few good chuckles with it and its just an enjoyable film and the animation is pretty decent."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "A solid sequel and I can make the standard statement \u201eNot as good as the prequel but still worth watching\u201c. It continues seven years after the prequel. The world is aware and not afraid of the existence of monsters as they are more treated like celebrities. Mavis and Johnny are happily married and have a son named Dennis. Dennis has not shown yet any signs of his vampire heritage and his parents think about raising him in human company instead because it is dangerous for him with the monsters (Not by ill will or malice more by accidents or oversight). For Dracula this is disturbing and he wants Dennis to use or learn to activate his vampiric abilities as his next birthday in a few days is a crucial one. If he cant channel his abilities until then it will not be possible to archive them later by any normal means. This is a set up for the movie. The story impresses me. While it feels not as refreshing they tried something new atop of the established old. They could have played it safe but chose to add something. A good mixture of old and new. Again they archive good humor with more serious themes while avoiding both harming the other. They deal with some serious stuff here and succeed for most parts. I will admit however that it works less well than in the previous movie and is in a few scenes borderline for me. However the final act and conclusion are excellent and improved my rating. The great cast of voice actors return for their roles with Adam Sandler who works well here, Fran Drescher, Selena Gomez, Kevin James, Andy Samberg and David Spade. All resume the roles and fully deliver a great performance. For the Newcomers we have Asher Blinkhol as Dennis and the legend himself Mel Brooks as someone I will not spoil. Also we meet Johnny's family who fits in nicely but made some mistakes (The one that are born out of best intentions but mixed with misconception). The Animations have improved as to be expected. I repeat that the style is excellent and is more fitting than a more realistic approach would be. The animations mix perfect with the voice acting and you never doubt the characters. The director Genndy Tartakovsky delivers again and cements the statement that he is the real asset of Sony animations. Overall this is a good animated movie. We enjoyed it and wanted more movies in the franchise. It delivers while being weaker than the prequel which is normal. I recommend the entire trilogy so far (Maybe quadrilogy as part 4 is announced but I have no details yet)."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Hotel Transylvania 2 is a fun, yet equally silly movie, that amounts to an inconsequential movie directed solely at kids. If you have kids, this is a good movie to take them to, because it's funny and beautifully animated. However, if you hope you'll enjoy the film also, you may be disappointed. The voice cast is good, and some of the characters are well developed, but the film is very silly. The movie lacks a feeling of relevance, because there are no real consequences, and thus lacks any emotional depth. The silly tone makes the film good for little children, and if you liked the first film, you'll likely enjoy this one as well, but those looking for anything other than kids fluff, will be disappointed. In conclusion Hotel Transylvania is funny, sleek, and perfect for small children, but falls flat when it comes to delivering any real emotional depth, and ends up shallow."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Hotel Transylvania 2 takes a turn for the better in the series. Yeah it still has issues but it still is a good film. It's more lighthearted and funny than the first film that's for sure.

I truly enjoyed this movie and I couldn't stop laughing many many times throughout.

The jokes were noticeably funnier (sometimes corny but funny nonetheless)  and the pop culture gags were more toned down and less over the top. I thought the first two acts were mostly enjoyable but the third act is where it really picks up. Why is that, you ask? Two words: Mel Brooks. He steals every scene he's in and most of the funniest jokes in the movie come from him. He's such a talented comedian. It did have problems though: much like in the first movie, the villain is rather forced and some of the lines were too cheesy (example: \"You've let humans into your hotel but not into your heart\").

I'll give Hotel Transylvania 2 an A-."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "This film is the sequel to \"Hotel Transylvania\", an expected sequel given the success of the first film, which helped Sony Pictures Animation to assert itself as one of the great animation studios. Although not as good as the first film, it is not far behind and manages to entertain the audience very well.In this film, we start by watching the expected wedding of Mavis, Count Dracula's daughter, with the human Jonathan. After a short time, they both have a son, and the Count will turn out to be an affectionate and loving grandfather. It happens that he wants his grandson to be a vampire too. Thus, as the child approaches the age of five, the time at which the vampire's canine teeth should appear, the Count reveals himself to be increasingly obsessed with that idea, forcing Mavis to take action.The film is quite good but the story told is not as effective as that of the first film. The characters are the same, with the addition of several humans from Jonathan's family, but to whom little relevance is given. The jokes appear punctually and work well, being usually played by the Count and the main monsters, who are no longer able to scare, behaving in a less monstrous way. The dialogues also work wonderfully. The ending was the most downright negative point of the film, as it completely clashes with what happened before and has almost no connection with the main plot. It is as if it has been glued to spit to give the film an extra half hour in length.Genndy Tartakovsky again assures the direction and does it well, keeping the bulk of the team and the cast of the previous film. Adam Sandler continues to give voice to Dracula and prove to be very good at it. Equally good were the contributions of Kevin James, Steve Buscemi, Megan Mullally, Mel Brooks and David Spade. Selena Gomes and Andy Samberg also did a good job, but their characters have been relegated to a frankly secondary role and have been quite underdeveloped, with Mavis permanently irritated and Jonathan even more stupid and immature than in the first film.Technically, the film is based on computer animation and good quality CGI. I believe that the visual quality is even better than that of the first film. Good colors, brightness and sharpness are very evident characteristics here. The choice of songs and the soundtrack worked much better than in the first film. I especially liked the song \"I'm In Love With a Monster\", it is in your ear and has rhythm."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Hotel Transylvania 2 has its moments, but a good portion of its gags are unsuccessful in making me laugh and some of the parts in it are just simply unrealistic (even for a monster movie). The story isn\u2019t as good as the first, but still manages to retain some of the original\u2019s charm. This was an okay attempt for a sequel, but it wasn\u2019t quite as original or funny enough as I would have liked."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Hotel Transylvania 2 is once again directed by Genndy Tartakovsky, written by Robert Smigel and Adam Sandler, and starring Adam Sandler, Selena Gomez and Andy Samberg.The story is close to the first one, it's about Dracula and his friends try to bring out the monster in his half human, half vampire grandson in order to keep Mavis from leaving the hotel.For me, Hotel Transylvania 2 is better than the first one in everything, especially the humor... Let's get into everything in deep!Alright, HT2 is presenting a very simple message, with the same hidden message of the first one (racism), but this time is deeper than it was in the first one. But believe me, you won't predict the ending of this movie this time, and it's kinda bad, 'cause sometimes the predictable ending is better than the unexpected ending, cebause -as Dennis said- this ending ruined the message for kids, but for me as a teenager it didn't effect me, or made me hate or underrate the movie.The voices still ear-comforting and fitting, and still Selena Gomez is the best and the light-taker of the whole movie.Now with the CG-animation that it's totally improved, like in every way. Now it's totally eye-comforting. Like I said, almost everything is way better than the first one, so let's get moving to the best thing of this movie.. humor!This movie was totally better than the first one at this, it has more funny scenes, more rude humor and unexpected. This movie was hilarious, every joke worked with me, sometimes you don't even expect a joke, but you find lots. They actually made some simple stuff laughable!Hotel Transylvania 2 is better and funnier than the first one, and if you liked the first one, you will like one as well.
