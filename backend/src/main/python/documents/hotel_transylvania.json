The film does a good job of developing these characters, but sadly most of the others don't have much of their personalities shown. The film starts off slow, but soon it is a speedy sugarfilled ride. So there are some noticable flaws, but I feel that this will be pretty enjoyable overall."

      "text": "This film is one of the best that Sony Pictures Animation has made, finally putting it at the level of Disney, Pixar or Dreamworks. These four giants of animated films have been fighting for a long time. Sony has so far been the most discreet and least successful competitor, however, with this film and the ensuing franchise, the studio has finally managed to show its worth.The script is simple: after losing his wife in a confrontation with violent humans, the secular Count Dracula hides, with his daughter Mavis, in an isolated castle, protected from the humans eyes. To make it profitable, it turns it into a large hotel specially designed to welcome other monsters and creatures that want distance from people. But, as the centuries go by, Mavis has grown up and wants to finally see the world beyond the immense dark forest that surrounds the castle. And that is what Dracula is most afraid of, as he regards human beings as highly dangerous.The film was perfectly capable of humanizing and giving a funny touch to the monsters that we get used to seeing in horror films. Dracula, the Mummy, the Werewolf, Quasimodo, the Invisible Man, Frankenstein's monster, Bigfoot... they're all here, and all of them much more human and lovable than they could be in another kind of film. The plot rests on the father-daughter relationship, on the way a father tries to protect his daughter until eventually she feels suffocated and revolts against it. The most comical scenes are reserved for the Count, especially when he plays with Jonathan, the human teenager who, against all odds, finds the castle and decides to explore it. The dialogues are excellent and the humour is everywhere.The direction is ensured by Genndy Tartakovsky, who previously collaborated with Cartoon Network Chanel, where he was responsible for some of their most iconic animated shows. It is, therefore, an interesting bet that worked very well. The voice actors cast is large and very good, with the veteran Adam Sandler and Selena Gomez at the head. Everyone did their job very well and fit the characters perfectly. I found Sandler's effort to make his voice more Romanian especially interesting, although it might not be necessary.Technically, the film is based on computer animation and CGI, whose quality seemed somewhat irregular but generally good. Unlike the films from other studios, music and songs are far from being the strong point here... in fact, it was one of the weakest bets in this film, with forgettable songs that seem to be there only because they have to be there, without being able to add quality and joy to the film. The ending, where music plays a predominant role, ends up a little blurred because of that."

Being a fan of Tartakovsky from his Dexter's Laboratory days (and others), I thought the animation was incredible, yet warm unlike other recent computer animated films. The director actually uses the method to its fullest. Plus, I LOVED that they didn't throw in pop culture jokes for the adults, instead they found humor within the art style and situations. Yes, the story's kind of just ok. And, yes, there's a few gaps in the character development. The voice acting is great, even Sandler who is NOT over the top as some critics have pointed out. Got kids? Go see it, get the stick out of your butt and just have fun! (Not everything has to be Pixar, you know...)"

The all-star talent is mostly wasted.  Stars like David Spade barely use their most effective comic techniques here.  The laughs are driven by the script and animation, and any voices would have been sufficient.  Maybe that's one reason the critics were disappointed."

Like Frankenweenie or ParaNorman; both films surprised me not only because of the technique of animation and the esthetic, but also because of the message that these pictures gives, which clearly demonstrate that they were not the typical movie for children. Hotel Transylvania was the exception. It could not reach a least half the level than the films mentioned before. Despites that the idea of a hotel for monsters in vacations is original, everything else does not: the overprotective father, the rebel teenage daughter, the cool young guy and love at first sight; because of this the movie is absolutely predictable. In between it has some interesting topics, like the anger of Dracula cause by the images that the humans have of him (the scene of the plane is spectacular); and the stereotypes that the monsters have about the humans. Above all, this picture is very erratic, makes you laugh? Yes, but is empty."

It is bright and colorful, has likeable characters, and some great humor. The film has some clich\u00e9s but there is nothing terrible in here. If I had kids I would not mind showing this film at all. Enough of the humor works in this movie and is not dumb humor so adults will get through it ok. In short if you have kids and you want something bright, colorful, and funny to show them show them this. Hotel Transylvania is definitely the most upbeat of the three Halloween movies of 2012 but it is also the weakest because it is mainly for kids whereas the others were darker and had some more adult moments. However as kid\u2019s films go its ok. If you are a little kid you\u2019ll probably enjoy this one but if you are going into this movie expecting something at the same level as Dexter\u2019s Laboratory or Samurai Jack you\u2019ll probably be disappointed because this film is not even close to being on the same level it\u2019s just a little kids films with enough laughs to make it watchable."
