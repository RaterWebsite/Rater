Something that we should be thankful for is that Stallone knew the right way to create a sequel that could well be unnecessary. As is the custom, the best part comes in the last minutes, and in what form."

      "text": "O primeiro \"Rocky\" n\u00e3o \u00e9 um filme extraordin\u00e1rio, mas ao menos trouxe algo de novo. Sinto que esse aqui abusa do legado do antigo, e cai naquele vicio de tentar potencializar o que j\u00e1 deu certo. Nem preciso dizer que deu errado. Muito errado.O primeiro filme tamb\u00e9m se esfor\u00e7a para desenvolver seu personagem, mas aqui, como eu disse acima, tudo aprece ser potencializado. Ao inv\u00e9s de ter um personagem lento, temos um personagem burro. Ele aguentava porrada antes? Pois ent\u00e3o, vamos faz\u00ea-lo ganhar uma luta s\u00f3 tomando soco na cara, com a base pra baixo, em 90% da luta. Ele t\u00e1 sofrendo com a press\u00e3o p\u00f3s luta? Vamos p\u00f4r uma pra de caras falando merda pra ele. Tipo, \u00e9 tudo t\u00e3o obvio que perde qualquer tipo de senso. N\u00e3o d\u00e1 pra se emocionar, se identificar, nem mesmo torcer, pois se eu tinha duvidas antes, agora tenho certeza que Rocky \u00e9 um p\u00e9ssimo lutador.E ainda tem mais, o filme se aproveita do sucesso passado, revivendo cenas e musicas do anterior. O que parece legal a primeira instancia, mas aspira falta de criatividade e pregui\u00e7a. Outra coisa mal feita foi a transi\u00e7\u00e3o de tempo, onde numa cena eles est\u00e3o gr\u00e1vidos, e poucas ap\u00f3s j\u00e1 est\u00e1 em trabalho de parto.Enfim, isso que d\u00e1 por o protagonista para dirigir e roteirizar o pr\u00f3prio filme. Isso \u00e9 il\u00f3gico e cega qualquer um.Audio: English, with Portuguese subtitles. Q60T TV SpeakersQuality: 1080p SDR [Netflix]"

      "text": "Rocky II follows on from the original, directed by Stallone in 1979 it bares some contrasts to the original... Sylvester Stallone and Carl Weather's are in the hospital all mashed up from the first fight, Carl Weather's who plays Apollo Creed is in a wheelchair asking Stallone's character for a rematch....Rocky II has many great moments like the training at the end before the fight after Rocky's wife says WIN, also Rocky working in a meat factory before getting fired and doing silly aftershave commercials which are hilarious, him and his wife buying a new house and taking a walk through the zoo in the snow after Rocky is released from hospital, Rocky driving around in a new car which he eventually sells on, Rocky's wife slipping into a coma, just great moments after another... It's more or less similar to the original but Rocky II has more to offer, some newer ideas in there and seems more charged than the original and the rematch at the end certainly beats the fight in the original with the tempo of the fight at a faster pace and more brutal... Rocky II stars Sylvester Stallone, Burt Young, Carl Weather's, Burgess Meredith, Talia Shire and is a sports drama... Definitely the best Rocky movie in the series and beats the original so check out Rocky II... Excellent film even if Stallone seems very wooden at times."

I had fun with the humour and liked to see some background information of boxing. But the fighting scenes are ridiculous again, fortunately this part is less than in the first part. Technically it is better of course, so yes, I prefer this sequel."

      "text": "The sequel is a bit weaker but still a good movie in the franchise. It starts directly after Rocky ended. While initially neither Rocky nor Apollo want a rematch Apollo has lurking doubts. Rocky has proven to be worthy and maybe a superior rival or at least hurt his confidence and pride. Many people even claim that Apollo or his staff manipulated the results of the fight. Meanwhile Rocky just wants a normal live with Adrianna. There is a quote in a later Rocky movie that life hits harder than any enemy could. This is shown here as Rocky (and Adrianna) struggle. He won the fame and respect but it is fast forgotten and society barely cares about yesterdays heroes. However it would not be a Rocky movie if there would be no rematch, harsh training and resolve. Again I like the relatable real live problems even when they have less of an impact than in the prequel. I must also praise the final fight as it is again intense and engaging. The cast is great again. Rocky, Adrianna, Mickey and Apollo are great in their roles. No missteps here. In my Rocky review I missed talking about the soundtrack. Maybe it is given for me that there are timeless classics. For me all Rocky movies have great soundtracks and we are not even at \u201cEye of the Tiger or \u201cBurning Heart\u201d by Survivor. But back to this movie. Overall they used the Rocky formula and made an enjoyable movie. It has not the same impact and creates not the same amount of emotions but that means not that it is garbage or even below average. It is worth watching and rememberable."

      "text": "i did it..Rocky IIIt always is tricky and a huge risk to create a sequel and live up to the expectation especially when the first one is loved worldwide to this level and acclaimed by the critics and they did it, again; its just as good as the first one. Rocky II is sensationally upbeating and exhilarating with enough content for 2 hours of runtime; even though being predictable, is still fun and filled with all the clich\u00e9d drama. Sylvester Stallone's smart idea by picking it up right where it was left off works as a charm and gives enough depth to the characters and the plotline. And he stretches himself too, as a director and writer but also as an actor giving enough range to stage himself up along with a great supporting cast. Rocky II connects with the audience more than the previous one allowing the audience to root and even cheer for the protagonist which shows the excellence of the director on execution but again the choreography seemed a bit loose."

      "text": "Rocky II was made in 1979 and Stallone directed it as far as I know, it's the continuation, sequel or follow on from the original Rocky movie... Rocky II see's the return of Talia Shire, Burt Young, Burgess Meredith, Carl Weathers and of course Sylvester Stallone.... To me Rocky II is a bit like the original but added more fun to it and there's scenes like Rocky (Stallone) and Adrian (Shire) walking through or near the zoo with snow on the ground and a tiger. We also see Rocky and Adrian getting married I think, Rocky doing some television commercial stuff involving aftershave, looking for work, training, driving around in a car, buying stuff, doing part time work in a meat factory or something and Adrian (Talia Shire) slips into a brief coma with Rocky (Stallone) praying she wakes up and seeking solace in a church and also the birth of their son happens. We see a great training scene when Rocky has to catch a chicken and he says to Mickey (Burgess Meredith) \"I feel like a Kentucky fried idiot\" which is pretty amusing. Basically this film is better than the original and offers more in terms of entertainment and the fight at the end is even better than the original. Great acting by everyone involved and the chemistry between the actors is great and Rocky II is about Rocky's rematch with Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers). Great film and in my opinion best one in the whole series."

The movie moves a little more slowly than its forerunner, but it won't keep you from enjoying it. Even though the film lacks the depth of the first half, it is nevertheless a worthy and excellent sequel. The movie's screenplay is solid, but it slows down a bit in the middle. Both the music and the direction are excellent. Burgess Meredith and Sylvester Stallone both played their parts admirably, and the rest of the cast was as sincere. You will undoubtedly be entertained by the film, which is deserving of the label of sequel."
