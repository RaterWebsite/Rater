First off, this is a survival movie, but NOT a nature survival movie. The wolves aren't really killing for food or survival, there's a bunch of pompous exposition about them organizing and taunting the survivors and other crap. The wolves don't even bother eating some of the kills, the characters might as well be fighting the hillbillies from Deliverance, this is NOT a nature movie.

The actors all portrayed their respective characters quite well, and although a tad bit predictable at times, there were enough surprises and thrills to push you to the edge of your seat and care if the characters lived or died. It was a bit heavy on the existential angst that was sometimes out of place, but overall it just helped develop the characters and give a meaningful back story in between the action packed escape scenes through the tundra. The wolves, though unrealistically vicious, were necessarily so, in order to provide more danger and excitement. Overall, an action-packed thriller with sufficient character development and surprises to keep you interested."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Intense and sad. A dog gets eaten. Liam Neeson is great, as usual, and, like most movies nowadays, he's in it.

Like many critics have said, the movie can be very poetic and introspective, and the cinematography is very pretty.  The wolf attacks start out being pretty scary.  They're brutal and fill the film with undeniable tension, but eventually they start being presented in a cleche way.  The attacks become too often, and the wolves themselves are used too much like Hollywood monsters.  This starts to compete with the higher, more artistic sensibilities in the movie instead of enhancing them.  This is also definitely one of the bleakest films I have ever seen, with a nihilistic agenda I absolutely disagree with.  However, Liam Nieson gives a great performance as always, and I can't deny that overall it's a gritty, gripping movie which is way better than most movies that come out in January.  In fact, it might be one of the best January releases ever."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "I appreciate the spare, gritty look and feel of the movie. No, the wolves didn't look 100% realistic with Jurassic Park-style CGI, but it doesn't matter. What's here is certainly convincing enough. The relationships between the men, they way each of them reacts to the crisis, and their journey have a very real texture to them. In some way that I can't specifically articulate, it reminds me a bit of Meek's Cutoff (a film I don't care for), though this film is much more entertaining. The characters are a bit flat, and given the way that some of the dialogue was written, it also reminds me of more off-the-cuff, found-footage films like Blair Witch and Paranormal 3. Which worked for me - it all sounds very natural.

The Grey will grip you and toss you around for 2 terrifying, gut wrenching, and heart pounding hours. You will love and hate every minute of this movie, it's that powerful. This is the most suspenseful and terrifying movie i have seen in a long time. You will grow to have a major fear of wolves after this movie, I sure did. Plus i just have to say it, it was great to hear Liam Neeson quote \"I'm going to start beating the s**t out of you in about 5 seconds\" Just one of the few comedic relief moments in this amazing film.

Like most survival films, it has the stereotypical cast of characters, especially the annoying one that argues constantly with the others.  They never seem to be the ones that die initially.

For me it doesn't have the repeatability factor - I have no desire to ever see the film again, but it is well made.

They struggle to survive against extreme weather, physical injuries and a pack of wolves. The action is swift and jarring, without being too graphic.

Get a clue of what real story, real character is about. If the wolves aren't realistic there's a reason for that, which makes everything more haunting, more freakish, more alive than in a straight action movie.\r I thought Joe Carnahan was onto something when NARC came out, and this reinforces that feeling.

The process of suspending my disbelief was continuously interrupted by these wolves on steroids.  Kept waiting to learn they were the progeny of some escaped military experiment. That would have actually been more believable. Please stop maligning our hapless wolves (the REAL ones)! Only Neeson saved this from being a silly fairy tale. I was very highly upset by the abrupt ending.   I mean, we expect to be rewarded for tagging along on a perilous journey with the characters of a suspenseful story in the first place, right?  THE PROS *Great performances. Neeson at his best, as usual. *Awe-inspiring visuals of misty mountain ranges. *Crash seemed horrifically realistic."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "While this movie isn't as bad as I thought it would be, it still wasn't very good. The main problem with the movie is that it was unrealistic and unconvincing. The wolves were made to be much smarter and bloodthirsty than they are in reality, and for some reason they would appear and disappear at random points in the movie. If you've ever seen Frozen, you know what I mean. The random disappearance/appearance lead to more than a couple plot holes as the movie went on. And then there's the fact that a man somehow jumps across a 50 foot gap.... how? The second problem is the editing. While not terrible, throughout the movie there are flashbacks that just don't seem to make sense as to where they're placed. It felt clumsy and pretty awkward. And finally, there's the ending. While it could have been worse, it still is just not good. While cliffhangers can totally be appropriate in some cases, a survival thriller is not one genre it works particularly well for. This is one ending that will more than likely make you frustrated. There are a few positive things about this movie. The acting was fine (much to my surprise), and for the most part the script wasn't bad, minus a few absolutely absurd conversations that happen throughout the film. Think of this one as Poseidon in Alaska, though this one isn't quite as bad as Poseidon. It isn't a great movie.

The lack of Liam Neeson kicking @$$ and taking names and the lack of over CGIed scenes is extremely refreshing in an industry that has been overrun with thrillers.

You will be surprised and you will most likely cry at many points in this film.

What one experiences is a cinematographic waste of astounding, achromatic transcendental visuals, hampered by the dragging sense of directorial indecisiveness and subpar writing. Aside from Neeson's valiant efforts to egress from his enslaved character, the film enthralls with its surprisingly fresh metaphysical overtones, and adhesive tie-ins toward the latter-half.

It's gritty and dark and the movie portrays the overall dismal tone very well through: character conversations, setting, and suspense.  The movie is very well done, with only the blemish being the CGI wolves that seem to feel cheap.  Other than that, the movie is great.  Dialog conveys most of the story, although what is told is short and vague, it manages to give you an overarching background to the characters that is mostly complete.  The movie does a really good job of pulling you in and keeping your interest until the conclusion.  The characters were somewhat stereotypical, but not over-the-top.  The language was controlled and wasn't overdone, and I didn't feel like their was random expletives added for laughs.  The survival aspect was very cool, and Liam Neeson's character is Oscar-worthy.  This movie deserves to be nominated as best movie, best character, and best sound design.  Although, it wouldn't be nominated for best CGI; it wasn't the worst I have seen.

Hadn't they seen the trailer in which Neeson is shown taping a knife and small broken bottles to his hands in preparation for hand-to-paw combat with a wolf?

Not for a minute did I believe what I was seeing was an accurate representation of wolf behavior, nor did I leave the theater hating wolves. On the contrary, I left the theater feeling highly entertained, and with a heightened curiosity about natural wolf behavior. Subsequently I learned that although there are recorded incidents of wolves attacking humans, they are negligible. Wolves are naturally shy of humans. But I didn't go to the theater thinking I was about to see a National Geographic special either. Neeson was terrific playing a very sympathetic character trying to deal with the great sadness in his life. The slow unraveling of the truth behind his deep sadness is one of the strengths of the movie. But what I loved best about this movie was the fact that it did not turn out to be the kind of macho guys' movie the trailer led you to believe. There are some very moving scenes in the movie. Neeson helping a victim of the plane crash deal with the inevitable result of his horrific injuries was for me was quite moving. And the plane crash itself was all too realistic. Yeah, it was pretty riveting. And you'll be surprised to learn of the significance of the scene in which Neeson faces off with the wolf.

Throughout The Grey he does what he can to lead plane crash survivors through the frozen tundra of Alaska, and no one questions his age. Director Joe Carnahan takes the audience into a bleak lifestyle amid the Alaskan pipeline. Ottway (Neeson) makes it through with flashbacks of his wife and a chilling voice over. The crash is shown from within the plane and avoids many of the common theatrics. No one is clearly shown being sucked out. For that matter most of the visual effects cast a less than ideal lighting circumstance, which drives home the motif. Injuries, freezing winds, and a lack of food are enough foes for any survivors, but our heroes are being pursued by wolfs. I'm not suggesting that it's impossible, but the behavior of these creatures puts on quite the show. They've certainly seen Halloween. Credulity is also being pushed to limits when the standards line such as \"who made you the leader\" have to be muttered and one hothead fancies a brawl. Of course Neeson's dominance of the narrative makes him a safe bet, and his buddies a risk. As the film wears on I wanted to buy these blokes more time. Despite how simple the premise I'm sure I could have been entertained for 3 hours. Maybe if the other guys had more spotlight scenes they wouldn't feel so much like Ottway's human shields. The story is simple enough that a big reveal at the end is somehow more effective for the sake that no one was waiting for it. This isn't mystery. What The Grey manages to do with the underexplored is leave the viewer with less question and more statements. The Grey is a man's movie. Fatigue and despair translate with the same forceful impact of the physical blows the survivors endure. It's also a perfect example as to why one should wait for the monk's reward at the end of the credits."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "a very dissapointing story of survival..its dissapointing to the sense that for less than 2 hours of watching it is pointless though good acting for Liam Neeson...depressing movie"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This movie is brilliant.
