I'm pretty sure they were mostly damning with faint praise. After all Jennifer, while certainly an attractive female, came across as a sorority pledge playing dress-up on S and M rush night.\r In Elektra she looks even more ridiculous. There have been plenty of great female assassins over the years from the camp of a Bond villain, to the seductiveness of Linda Fiorentino, even the girl next-door deadliness of Bridget Fonda in Point of No Return. Female assassins are a wonderful staple of filmdom, seductive yet deadly. Garner is neither. \"She looks like she is thinking of puppies,\" claimed one reviewer I read and I concur. If the Smurfs were X-rated ninja's, then Garner would still be miscast in Smurfette: Deadly Blue.\r Her costumes certainly don't help her cause. You almost have the urge to tell her to put some clothes on and bright red Victoria Secret lingerie just doesn't scream stealth or deadly. Lord knows the rest of this mess doesn't help Garner either.\r While Terrance Stamp can do no wrong every else seems either miscast or afraid of stealing Garner's thunder. Add on poor special effects, villains that turn into family friendly yellow smoke when killed, ninjas that crash through windows like Army rangers, gas stoves that explode like nuclear weapons, laundry fu, Japanese villains out of a World War 2 propaganda film and my personal favorite the warmest Christmas in Canadian history.\r The movie clearly takes place in the northwest United States or Vancouver. The days are long, everyone is in short sleeves, and Garner takes recreational swims in the lake. (Canadian Lakes are notoriously cold even in August mind you) So when a cherub faced character asks Garner over for Christmas dinner Elektra isn't the only one surprised.\r Garner is sexy but when it's time to kill she should either get dressed or let the grown-ups take care of things."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05de\u05db\u05d9\u05e8 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05d3\u05de\u05d5\u05ea \u05e9\u05dc \u05d0\u05dc\u05e7\u05d8\u05e8\u05d4, \u05d0\u05d1\u05dc \u05d4\u05e1\u05e8\u05d8 \u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 \u05de\u05de\u05e9 \u05d2\u05e8\u05d5\u05e2 \u05d5\u05de\u05de\u05e9 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05de\u05d5\u05d1\u05df \u05dc\u05de\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d7\u05dc\u05d9\u05d8\u05d5 \u05dc\u05ea\u05ea \u05dc\u05d4 \u05e1\u05e8\u05d8 \u05d0\u05dd \u05d4\u05d9\u05d0 \u05d4\u05d9\u05d9\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d2\u05e8\u05d5\u05e2\u05d4 \u05d2\u05dd \u05d1\u05d3\u05e8\u05d3\u05d5\u05d5\u05d9\u05dc. \u05dc\u05d0 \u05de\u05d5\u05de\u05dc\u05e5 \u05dc\u05e8\u05d0\u05d5\u05ea \u05de\u05de\u05e9 \u05de\u05e9\u05e2\u05de\u05dd"}, {"rating": "4", "text": "While I like some characters and parts of the story I must admit that it is not a good movie nor in the so bad it is good category. Many said this harmed female superhero movies for years and I think they are right. As if there is a secret rule in Hollywood that these movies need a bad script, a weak story and some poorly written characters. I think of the even worse Catwoman movie and the Supergirl 1984 movie is also some of the best additional examples. Exceptions are the great Wonder Woman 2017 and the excellent Wonder Woman 2009 animated movie (The animated movie is a hidden gem). They both have well written characters, an engaging story and immersion. Lets go back to this movie: After the events of the Daredevil movie Elektra is taught the ancient art of Kimagure that gives her a set of superhuman abilities (Chi or Chakra based) and starts working as assassin. Years later she gets a contract that will challenge her in ways she did not imagine as she still has a code of honor and emotions. So far not a bad story but foreseeable and generic. I could predict nearly everything from miles away as they heavily use tropes, cliches and staples that are common because other movies / medias used them before ( a lot). Then there is the acting. Jennifer garner is excellent but cant turn the tide or defeat the bad script. A great performance in a bad movie. The other actors do their jobs and I think the script weakened the performance also as this movie had is moments. For clarification it is often that I had disbelieves of the story and though that many scenes can be improved. This is not a good sign. Someone said that you can get away with many things if a movie is engaging and immersive. It it is foreseeable or boring the watchers will search for errors, mistakes and think about failures in the structure of events and characters acting weird. Lets say the acting is as good as it can be in a script that needs improvement. I will not blame actors for bad writing. The fight scenes are however good but also nothing you will remember.  Overall this is the kind of movie were I see potential for a great experience. The script is the worst villain in this story. While it has it moments it is not worth remembering and I am a fan of Jennifer Garner since Alias. Watchable once but nothing to remembered with exception of Jennifer Garners performance."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I love the aesthetics of the film, the acting, the script.

Jennifer Garner tried her best, but she can't save Elektra from being a puny-sized, adorable film that no one even manages to care about after the next day passes."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "I have never understood the appeal of Jennifer Garner as an action/adventure star. Based on my limited exposure to her work, she's better in comedic or lightly dramatic roles (such as her turn in 13 Going on 30). Nothing that happens in Elektra has changed my mind. Although Garner was arguably the best thing about the lukewarm comic book adaptation of Daredevil, her character had limited screen-time, playing fourth fiddle to Ben Affleck, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Colin Farrell. The translation from supporting character to lead doesn't go smoothly. Garner has difficulty carrying this movie, although the weakness of the script could be part of the reason.\r Instead of following the usual superhero path of the protagonist trying to stop a diabolical villain from taking over the world (or some similarly grandiose goal), Elektra goes all metaphysical on us. It seems that we have reached a key point in the endless battle between good and evil. A Chosen One has been born and both sides want her. Evil is represented by \"The Hand\" - a bunch of Japanese bad guys who have cool powers and disappear in a puff of green smoke when they are killed. Good is represented by the film's resident Yoda/Mr. Miyazaki, Stick (Terence Stamp, who played the super-villain Zod in Superman II) and his reluctant pupil, Elektra (Garner). She isn't done with her training yet, so she's not a real Jedi, and the dark side of the Force beckons\u2026 Oops, sorry, wrong movie.\r \"But, wait,\" you say, \"Elektra died in Daredevil.\" That is a correct observation, but in films like this, death is only a temporary inconvenience. Characters return from beyond the grave as often in comic books as they do in soap operas. It turns out that Stick can manipulate time and revive the dead. Elektra starts out her second life as his apprentice, but is eventually kicked out of paradise. Instead of seeking out Ben Affleck (at least on screen), she becomes a paid assassin (imitating what he did in Gigli). It's after she turns down a job to kill Mark Miller (Goran Visnjic) and his teenage daughter, Abby (Kirsten Prout), that she runs afoul of The Hand. They have decided that if Chosen One Abby won't join them, they'll eliminate her from the equation. When Elektra becomes Mark and Abby's accidental protector, she ends up headed for a confrontation with the evil sorcerer/swordsman Kirigi (Will Yun Lee) and his henchmen, Tatoo (Chris Ackerman replacing the late Herve Villechaize), Stone (Bob Sapp), and Typhoid (Natissia Malthe).\r There's really only one good action sequence in all of Elektra, and that's the climactic battle between the title character and her nemesis. Director Rob Bowman borrows techniques from Hong Kong martial arts duels for this fight, but their integration is sloppy. Zhang Yimou (Hero, The House of Flying Daggers) might have been able to do something with all of the dancing sheets, but Bowman's use of them is merely confusing. This one-on-one struggle has plenty of high-energy moments, but the resolution is unsatisfying. When it was over, my underwhelmed reaction was, \"Is that it?\"\r Elektra contains plenty of intriguing elements that are left unexplored. Except for an occasional quip, we never learn much about her death experience. The character is afflicted with an obsessive/compulsive disorder, but this turns out to be a personality quirk that is discarded when it doesn't play a role in the storyline's resolution. All of the human relationships (Elektra/Stick, Elektra/Abby, Elektra/Mark) are underdeveloped. I think there's supposed to be some sort of romantic attraction between Elektra and Mark (after all, they kiss twice), but actors Garner and Goran Visnjic (on a break from \"E.R.\") never connect.\r Elektra is one of the least effective comic book-to-movie stories to have come along in the past few years. Without a viable screenplay, there's nowhere for the character to go, and no way to avoid making her look silly. Garner looks elektra-cute in red, but I should not have been thinking about the impracticality of that outfit as assassin's garb. Involving movies banish such thoughts; Elektra encourages them. When a comic book movie fails to grab its audience, it is apt to come across as excruciatingly dumb. That description applies to offerings like Catwoman, The Punisher, and Elektra. This movie is better than the other two, but that's not company in which any self-respecting superhero would want to be included."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "I loved Daredevil But this one is just truly awful in almost every single thing."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "don't look for your opponent..ElektraElektra lacks every ingredient that a comic-book movie contains or even a movie for that matter, as it is flat out exhausting from the top."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Jennifer Garner returns as Elektra, a lethal synthesis of grace and power with the mystical power known as kimagure: a limited ability to see the future.

J.Gard was soo perfect but was wasted in the rest of the movie. the whole movie should've been taken place at night. i loved her all red outfit and it even paid homage to ultimate elektra when she wore all white, the problem becomes when the writers zak penn, stuart zicherman & raven metzner for creating non existing comic book characters that's made only for this movie characters like Abby Miller, Mark Miller, Roshi, Kinkou, Meizumi in an incredibly flawed incoherent scriptand making Stone a villain, gender swapping Nina McCabe by making her into a male character only using the character last name McCabe and should've kept Ben Affleck as Matt Murdock/Daredevil scene. I only gave this a 7 score rating only bcuz of how good the opener scene is. the movie shot itself by trying to build a story around non existing characters instead of maintaining the supernatural mysterious and myth setting that it build up rather than trying to create artificial connections to the created characters that u don't care about. this movie should've had Radioactive Man as elektra's main villain since they're enemies in the comics. it could've played off of the idea of resurrection and greg rucka's 03 elektra comic: (Elektra is forced to confront her murderous past after being taken hostage by an adversary. Feeling desperate in her containment, Elektra must choose between continuing her homicidal professin or making an attempt to change her life.) that would've been a far more impactful story then what we've ended up with. ppl are right about this movie doesn't know what it what's to be it's all over the place. bcuz this movie should've been a spin off sequel to daredevil that shows what took place after the events from '03's daredevil. i do enjoy J.Gard's elektra but the bad, outweighs the good. too many shortcomings too many subplots and boring unoriginal created characters that the story surrounds itself with brings this movie down and latch itself onto this movie like a tumor. J.Gard tried to do the best that she had to work with and even she knew it was a bad movie and admitted during the world premiere of this movie. the writer and fox wasn't even confident of the very movie that it's spinning off from why bring back MSJ the director of '03 Daredevil to write this movie and isn't even confident in his own work and advertising it as \"from the makers that brought u x-men franchise\" instead of the director from daredevil it's no surprise that this movie turn out the way that it did i love J.Gard from '03 daredevil and she showed her potential at the start of this movie but was wasted in the rest of it.so overall it should've had a better main villain, the setting should've always taken place at night to keep the mystique, and mysteriousness of elektra, the writing after the opening scene was over was cringe and a chore, the created characters for this movie was a plot device and unappealing, and less that was told about elektra could've also be something that this movie could've benefited from and this movie should've had kept affleck's daredevil scene so it can feel like it's a in the same universe but this movie feels so disconnected, so to sum it up this movie was directionless filter that's so disjointed with Garner and her character being wasted. I hope she gets a second chance, and the blame shouldn't go on her she did the best that she could, however it doesn't matter how good of an actor and actress u are, u can't make a bad script and awful movie good, no matter how good u are. the blame Soley goes to: rob bowman, zak penn, stuart zicherman & raven metzner and 20th century fox."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "The fight scenes are serviceable, but nothing too special.
