      "text": "Thunderball isn't necessarily a bad film but it is one that desperately needed a trip to the editing room. All of these underwater sequences were so overly long and boring. There were put in to do nothing but pad the runtime and they simply didn't need to be as long or as numerous as they had to be. It's just total filler to me and it kills the movie because it's an over 2-hour movie that could have easily been cut down another 20-30 minutes.Now would this editing have saved the movie? Not really because the story is very similar to what we have already seen before and the villain is too generic but I would have at least increased my overall score a few points."

      "text": "Thunderball is the fourth installment of the James Bond franchise starring Sean Connery as the titular character. It's a fun movie, with the plot being that the insidious SPECTRE organization headed by Number One, Ernst Stavro Blofeld,  steals two NATO atomic bombs and holds the world for ransom of \u00a3100 million in diamonds under its threat to destroy an unspecified metropolis in either the United Kingdom or the United States (later revealed to be Miami). Bond searches for the bombs in the Bahamas, where he encounters Emilio Largo, the card-playing, eye patch-wearing SPECTRE Number Two. Backed by CIA agent Felix Leiter and Largo's mistress, Domino Derval, Bond's search culminates in an underwater battle with Largo's henchmen. The underwater fight scenes are exciting but a little too lengthy. There are some good action scenes, and Bond uses some classic gadgets like a jetpack. Number One or Ernst Stavro Blofeld's face is never shown, and he strokes a white Persian cat which is a trope parodied in mainstream culture. He wears a Mao suit and kills subordinates with a control switch that drops them from their chairs at the desk to a pit of fire. Emilio Largo, or Number Two, kills subordinates in a similar fashion, by feeding them to sharks. These are classic Bond tropes I enjoyed seeing in the movie."

      "text": "Its first half may be overencumbered with exposition, buildup, and the occasional head scratcher of a scene/moment/line/etc, but as soon as we arrive in the Bahamas, \"Thunderball\" immediately becomes a more fun and dramatically ironic spy actioner filled with some of the more recognizable elements that we all know Bond films for. It still has nothing on \"Dr. No\" and \"Goldfinger,\" but it's also nowhere near bad or even overrated."

      "text": "Having recently seen all Bond movies + Never say never again, I made a list of the movies from best to worst.Thunderball is at the bottom. This is hands down the worst Bond movie.It's also the only movie of the franchise that literally angered me beyond any desire to even talk about it.Plot:Bond's in a spa(no particular reason). Someone tries to kill him with a back stretcher(ditto). He then decides to act upon it by banging the hot nurse. Coming out of bed after that, he coincidentally finds a corpse. Several people try to kill him. He decides to then not call the police, or MI6, and goes back to bed.He then comes home to MI6, and nuclear bombs have been stolen. In the dossier for the mission to retrieve them, codename Thunderball, he coincidentally finds a picture of the guy he saw dead at the spa, and a coincidental hot girl. He says he's going after the hot girl.The hot girl is coincidentally the mistress of the big villain of the movie. When Bond finds the villain, he says \"I thought I saw a Spectre on your shoulder\".The villain says yes.Now if you think that randomly finding a corpse in a spa and getting attempted twice, then by pure luck the corpse is that of a pilot of bombs that are being coincidentally stolen that very night, then he coincidentally gets a picture of some random girl, who coincidentally happens to be with the villain, who freely admits to being the villain, if you thought that was poor writing, you're not wrong, but you're barely touching the surface yet.The movie then follows a pattern of incomprehensibly terrible writing and plot points. Villain sends two assassinations on Bond, and then his second in command tells him \"we can't kill Bond, or MI6 will know something's up\". He says \"I KNOW\" angrily. He then sends two more assassination crews.The villain and Bond's interactions are some of the most egregiously terrible stuff I've ever seen in the franchise. When Bond literally visits him, in his home, surrounded by dozens of henchmen, and nobody but Bond knows he's there, the villain just offers him a drink, right after Bond pretty much said he was interested in his mistress. This is AFTER trying to kill him several times, and right before sending more people to kill him.If only the general plot and dialogue were absurdly terrible and nonsensical, maybe this wouldn't be so bad. But it's also some of the worst direction I've ever seen. Some scenes are soooooooo long, like the plane landing to indicate Bond has arrived takes 3 times longer than it should. The final battle is an extended 5 minute underwater fight where 25 goons in full suit (no visible faces) fight another 25 goons in full suit. It's a painfully long and pointless mess with realistic sounds, so all you hear is the sound of water. And to top it all, to make Bond recognisable, they put him in a big orange dive suit...Direction, dialogue, logic, plot, speed, are all so absurdly bad that I can't believe this movie followed the brilliant Goldfinger. I watched all these movies with a friend, and at the end, all I could say to this one was \"fu**, I don't even want to talk about this, what an absolute s**t\". It crosses beyond incompetent and goes into outright infuriatingly bad."

      "text": "The fourth James Bond movie. While it is by no standard a bad movie in the franchise I find it a bit underwhelming especially after Golfinger raised the bar for James Bond movies. Maybe it is the curse of being the follow up movie to one of the best and most acclaimed entry in the franchise.The story is enjoyable as SPECTRE sets up their biggest coup (Wont go into details as it pretty much spoils half of the movie). It is however also nothing special or original enough to raise my rating while I admit that it has its moments. I always return to comparing it with other James Bond movies and it lacks an interesting villain like Goldfinger, Scaramanga, Jaws or Blofeld (More screentime / main villain as he is in the movie). Later I learned that this was planned as episode of a TV series and expanded to a movie. This explained a lot. Other than the story we get some cool gadgets from Q and some solid action. For the actors there are no missteps. Sean Connery is good as always, Claudia Auger does a good performance and while I don't have Emilio Largo on my top villains list I think he did a good job. I think I finish my review here with my conclusion. It is an enjoyable James Bond movie but nothing in it will be remembered well or land on a top 10 list easily. Worth watching but fast forgotten. It was the curse of being in the middle of 2 better James Bond movies."

I also think this movie contains John Barry\u2019s finest score for the series.Even though the previous year\u2019s Goldfinger set the standard for the \u201cBond formula\u201d, this one and the sequel You Only Live Twice are the entries that are often the source of parody for the Austin Powers series."

      "text": "Third time's not the charm, Young fails and Connery takes the blame, while the banner might still be happy with the result.ThunderballYoung is in charge again. And the vacation he took seems like, it was definitely an unaffordable one. The price this franchise faces, this time, is that it is the first upset of so many to come. But what's ironical is that while this film was pitched or presented with spectacular suggestions, it frankly would have seemed like the best of all. Using their budget to its best, what the creators have tried to pull off in such a scale is surely admirable. But tested with time, and it unfortunately doesn't hold up to the promises it has to offer. And mind you, it is not the inadequacy on technology or creativity, it is the execution itself.With a narration so ambiguous and execution so precarious, there was always very little chance for it to ever make it into the big leagues. The director Terence Young is giving his all, from brimming his scenes with catchy one liners to levity and from brutal action to more fire blazing in the background, but while doing so, he left out a key ingredient: romance. The romance between Sean Connery and whoever the antagonist is this time, there is no dance between them for us to care about, frankly, either of them.Connery playing this character for the fourth time, seems natural by now, flirting shamelessly and drinking carelessly, his unbiasedness towards his likes and dislikes has gone habitual to us. This longest chapter of the franchise, up till then, seems like a literal waste of time, for as far as brain is concerned, it doesn't have the ability to provoke us in using it. This Thunderball won't let you have a ball, it may not be even considered as an entertaining one, let alone a gritty thriller which so it blatantly claims to be."

      "text": "Directed by Terence Young, produced by Kevin McClory, Harry Saltzman and Albert Broccoli and with a screenplay by Richard Maibaum and John Hopkins, this is the fourth film in the franchise 007. In this film, the franchise reaches the maturity after the consecration with \"Goldfinger\". The participation of McClory seems strange but, in fact, it's the result of a legal conflict, prior to the production.In this film, the British secret agent is admitted to a nursing home when he finds out, by sheer luck, a conspiracy to rob a French jet with two nuclear bombs. Not having been able to prevent it, Bond is sent to the Bahamas in order to contact the sister of the late pilot of the missing plane and obtain more information. It turns out that the girl is also the lover of Emilio Largo, the responsible for the disappearance. Bond escapes all assassination attempts and find the missing plane, as well as the enemy's plans and his connection to the terrorist organization SPECTRE, the same that Bond had already been fighting since the previous films.In this film, Sean Connery got a perfect interpretation of his James Bond. Rude, a little hard with the opposite sex but always seductive, he marked for decades the idea of the public on how Bond should be. In addition to the idyllic scenery of the Caribbean, the film brings us some curious machines, continuing a tradition which was closely associated to the 007 imaginary. It is the case of the jet-bag used in the opening scenes, the armored-boat used by the villain in the final chase or the respiratory device used by Bond in some of the underwater scenes that made this movie famous. However, in my opinion, one of the reasons why this movie has reached excellence is the relevance of its central subject, a subject that, at that time, was very present in society: the danger of a nuclear attack. We must have in mind that the missile crisis in Cuba happened a few years before the film was released and the whole society, both in the US and in Europe, lived under the imminent danger of a missile war.James Bond and the characters M, Q and Monneypenny were embodied by the same actors from the previous films. To these artists joined Claudine Auger (in the role of bond-turned, Domino), Luciana Paluzzi (in the role of assassin Fiona Volpe) and Adolfo Celi (in the role of villain, Largo)."

It has what you\u2019d want in a Bond movie:beautiful women, stunning locations, great music, Sean Connery in his prime and cool gadgets. Emilio Largo is not a good villain. He lacks any menace and looks like a stout upper executive than a proper villain as played by Adolfo Celli. Otherwise a solid entry."

The theme song is definitely one of the best of the series, and Connery gives a great performance as always, but the cracks with boredom are starting to show a little at times. Largo and Domino are decent characters, I wish they got more characterization. The underwater scenes are what really kill this film, they're long, boring, and confusing to follow, had they been fixed, I think this would have been a better film."

His tiny tube's maximum capacity of 4 minutes would not allow him to continue fighting continuously for more than 10 minutes. But since it's Bond, everything makes sense. Overall, the plot was uncomplicated and not really enjoyable to try and follow as some are. Additionally, it violated a number of Bond formula conventions. This might be interpreted both ways. Although this Bond was fine, it wasn't really enjoyable."
