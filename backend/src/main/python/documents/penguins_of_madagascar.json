The first was okay, the second was great even if it DID feel like it took elements from The Lion King, and the third was highly enjoyable. But you know who my favorite characters in the movie are? The penguins. So having them get their own film was expected considering the success of their TV series. And it was really fun. Sure, it has it's flaws (which I will get to later), but it makes up for it with some enjoyable action scenes, the fun and lovely animation, and funnier moments with the Penguins. Oh, sorry, I mean the \"Peng-wings\". It also helps us know them better, like how Skipper treats his team mates, and how Private feels about his position. However, the film isn't exactly perfect, and the problems can be found in the writing. The story seems kind of predictable and WAY too silly, even for a Penguins of Madagascar movie. Also, the jokes mostly fall flat, like the octopuses' names have to be given a joke, like \"Nicholas, cage them\" or \"Kevin, bake on\".

After the success of Madagascar, Dreamworks hastened to do so. When the fountain dried up, noting the popularity of the penguins, who were more than secondary characters initially, but to whom it was being given relevance, they decided to make a film where the protagonists are them. Of course it was a mistake. It was the same with Timon and Pumba from \"Lion King\", with the Minions from \"Despicable Me\" etc.Okay, I agree Penguins were funny in that context in which they were born. But I do not think they have what it takes to be protagonists. After three \"Madagascar\", where their participation was growing, they were worn out and had nothing more to offer. When we look at the script of this movie, this is evident. There's nothing new, it's just a means to profit at the expense of the popularity of the four characters.In addition to this problem, the film has the most idiotic script I've seen in many years. Simply poorly done, it has more holes than a fishing net. You see, penguins enter Fort Knox, the most sheltered place in the United States after the White House, to devour snacks they'd find in an ordinary convenience store, but the snack machine has a crazy octopus that wants revenge because people like penguins ... then the whole movie is centered on the quest for outlawed octopus, the struggle to curb his plans and an idiotic rivalry between the penguins and a kind of millionaire organization that protects animals (but the octopus is not an animal?) at risk and helpless ... Now you ask: how did the octopus know that the penguins would enter Fort Knox? How did he get in there in the first place? What is the origin of the mysterious substance that transforms penguins into monsters? Where does the \"North Wind\" money come from? I do not know what you think, but I kept thinking the writers should be drunk or drugged when they wrote this.Technically, the film does not bring anything interesting either. I have seen CGI better and more realistic, the animations are not beautiful nor bring the brightness of other films, the colors seem a little faded and the soundtrack is quite weak."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This is an hilarious movie with those wacky penguins.

On their way they encounter an elite undercover inter-species task force called North Wind that the penguins will also have to deal with.\r Now, this is a spy thriller and like all spy thrillers this one features a lot of gadgets and super-secret agents trying to stop a villain from conquering the world. Classic formula. Thus, when going into a movie like this you have to suspend your disbelief because you know that some of the gadgets or gizmos are capable of the implausible. However, this is not the case because the most inconceivable comes from the things that go down in the action scenes. It\u2019s not ridiculous in a fun way. It\u2019s ridiculous in a head-scratching and unpleasing way. You could dispute about the fact that is an animation and things like this shouldn\u2019t be taken seriously but even for an animated movie it is unendurable. I was in with my 12 year old cousin and I thought she would like the film but I noticed that she facepalmed herself lots of times during its running. That\u2019s how you know they went over the top.\r The movie begins with our 4 fellas breaking into Fort Knox as a present for Private\u2019s birthday. They arrive on a makeshift glider, they take down a few guards and put in an unlikely voice password (but hey, you never know) and boom they\u2019re in like that but wait because the movie isn\u2019t only taking our suspension of disbelief and is beating it over with a mace but it also makes us drop our jaw on the floor from how stupid it can be. So, after they break in arguably the most guarded place in the world with just a few moves,they\u2019re not looking for the gold but for the chips vending machine that\u2019s in the back of the gold room. I am not even kidding. That happened. Later they escape from an airplane that flies at an altitude of 8 km (if I don\u2019t mistake) by opening the cargo door and breathing without worries as if they were on the ground. Below them another airplane is on the route and they jump and just smash through the steel fuselage and get inside, again like it\u2019s something normal, and get to the cabin and take out the pilots and change course while the passengers in the back are just a bit scared because of some penguins breaching in. Just that. Something is wrong, isn\u2019t it??? Yes, it is. After Skipper and his comrades smashed in there were no alarms going off, nothing signaling an uncontrolled decompression that would probably,most likely make the plane crash. Only a lot of screaming.\r But this movie is not only characterized by ludicrous events but also by a clich\u00e9d and predictable plot and one-dimensional characters. The screenplay is written by John Aboud, Brandon Sawyer, Tom McGrath and Eric Darnell. There\u2019s nothing interesting about these penguins and since the screenwriters didn\u2019t have any new ideas for an original or at least working story they just put in some spy movie clich\u00e9s that we all moviegoers know about and added in a dash of gags. Adding some smiles didn\u2019t save its reputation because not even the smiles are good. They either last for too long or just aren\u2019t funny. There was only one pun relating to the fiscal issue in France that actually made me laugh.\r Though the screenplay wasn\u2019t good I can\u2019t say the same about the camerawork. Sometimes the camera follows graciously and smoothly the protagonists giving the movie a better flow and making the nonsensed and fast action easy to follow. The editing is top notch and the animation is beautiful presenting vivid and powerful colors.\r These were the only positive aspects of this picture. Luckily, I had the opportunity it in 2D and not in 3D. I heard from different critics that the 3D was good and that\u2019s proving once more that Dreamworks has a certain respect for the 3D but I wish they respected us moviegoers and kids as well by delivering movies that are good on a story level.\r Honestly, this year was a pretty good year for movies and I thought this one was going to stump my bad feelings regarding it but it\u2019s just another piece of gain from the studios and it\u2019s more an exhausting ride than exhilarating one. Kids will have fun and I guess this film is going to make a crap load of money and it will spawn a few (5) sequels that I hope not, of course, but I fear will all be this bad. Adults will be able to enjoy it only whilst being drunk. Yep, get ready."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "This movie has totally unoriginal jokes and silly humor.

The spin-off of the Madagascar characters further continues the ridiculousness of the franchise but unexpectedly, the over-ridiculous screenplay has already been seen elsewhere, and it looks a little bit more silly for the elders. Although lighthearted, the paper thin plot that does not allow much of characters development and utilise the ideas from other animations by changing a small part here and there are unable to make the adorable yet naughty penguins to match the quality of the old times of studio's production, even any recent Disney's production, or to match Puss in Boots (spin-off of Shrek series).

Surprisingly it never gets dull with the film constant moving from one scene to another with lots of energy and at no point is the original Madgascar crew missed as the penguins have always been the stars and prove they can carry the show on their own. Unfortunately, they are joined by a crew of not that interesting characters who weigh down the film following its first ten minutes. Even with this the film is still fun from the Dreamworks style humor involving an overlord of pop culture references and tons of other jokes that surprising don\u2019t get on ones nerves. The film doesn\u2019t do anything deep with the Penguins and at times the film could\u2019ve used some heart but there is a lot of fun and energy among the core characters that keep the film from falling apart. Penguins fans will enjoy the film as they are finally getting the Madagascar film they wanted. Those who aren\u2019t a fan of Dreamworks\u2019 style of humor will probably want to skip this one. Its nowhere near quality of Dreamworks\u2019 How to Train Your Dragon 2 but it\u2019s a fun hour and a half that even with low quality writing and humor that somehow shouldn\u2019t work still manages to be a step above most Dreamworks films."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Some animated movies tell deep stories meant to teach kids something, while others simply want to make them laugh. \"Penguins of Madagascar\" is the latter. The jokes come at an almost non-stop rate. The plot is a clich\u00e9 spy story.\r The humor itself is very childish. Kids are sure to keep laughing throughout, but unlike the best animated family movies there isn't much here for older audiences. Outside of a reoccurring joke regarding celebrity names most of the jokes parents and teens would laugh at were spoiled in the trailers.\r \"Penguins of Madagascar\" is a ridiculous film perfect for children.

In the case of this spirited animated movie, the answer is assuredly yes.\r The heroes are a feathered task force of secret-agent-like penguins, led with military discipline by Skipper (the voice of Tom McGrath). Literalists who complain that penguins do not live in Madagascar should note that the title refers to the \u201cMadagascar\u201d movie franchise.\r Although \u201cPenguins of Madagascar\u201d might look like a down-market spinoff \u2014 the original vocal stars, including Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett Smith and Sacha Baron Cohen, don\u2019t participate \u2014 the decision to focus on the series\u2019s comic relief has resulted in the loosest and perhaps funniest film of the brand.\r After a narrative setup that provides the wisp of a tether to the earlier movies, the four penguin main characters infiltrate Fort Knox \u2014 to visit a vending machine filled with discontinued cheese-puff snacks. They are soon whisked away by the genetic researcher Dr. Octavius Brine, actually a disguised, disgruntled octopus named Dave, with whom the penguins resided during a stint at the Central Park Zoo.\r Dave (a sporting John Malkovich), who sometimes barks orders in the form of actors\u2019 names (\u201cNicolas, cage them\u201d; \u201cRobin, write this down\u201d), plans to kidnap penguins from zoos and aquariums and transform them, ridding them of their cuteness. There will be no more cheering crowds and, as the movie acknowledges in a separate gag, no more documentaries.\r In their quest to thwart Dave\u2019s plot, the penguins have competition: a squad of Arctic animals commanded by a wolf known only as Classified. That Classified\u2019s voice belongs to the ubiquitous Benedict Cumberbatch is almost as amusing as any of the jokes.\r Visually, the movie, which can be watched in pointless 3-D, has little to set it apart, although a few of the mutant-penguin designs are worthy of the \u201cGremlins\u201d director, Joe Dante. Still, the lack of originality is offset by sheer silliness, including Classified and Skipper\u2019s Abbott and Costello-style argument over whether there\u2019s a long I in \u201cdiversion.\u201d The word fits the movie."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Should be much funnier with these characters.
