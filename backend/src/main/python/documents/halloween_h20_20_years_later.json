  "description": "Two decades after surviving a massacre on October 31, 1978, former baby sitter Laurie Strode finds herself hunted by persistent knife-wielder Michael Myers. Laurie now lives in Northern California under an assumed name, where she works as the headmistress of a private school. But it's not far enough to escape Myers, who soon discovers her whereabouts. As Halloween descends upon Laurie's peaceful community, a feeling of dread weighs upon her -- with good reason.",

The score is terrible and doesn\u2019t even feel like an Halloween movie. Actually did dig the change from haddonfield but it doesn\u2019t do anything with it. The mask being changed 3 times and with one cgi scene just makes this movie more **** The only good thing about this movie is Jamie lee Curtis."

      "text": "I'm not sure why it gets so much undue hate, especially compared to some of the others. It brings Laurie back, deals with her PTSD, retains the Shape's mystique by giving him little in the way of backstory or reason for returning now of all times. The mask isn't great and it's a bit of an awkward mix of a teenage post-Scream self-aware slasher, Halloween film and character study but it's fun and engaging without wearing out its welcome. The ending is fantastic as well. So much deserved catharsis."

Anyway, I came away pleasantly surprised, and this is now probably my 2nd (or 3rd at worst) favorite in the entire series. Really a nice wrap up to the whole Laurie/Michael storyline, and this is where it ends in my mind. Don't be fooled by Resurrection and the fact that Jamie Lee is in it - that movie is a farce and Jamie Lee's appearance is nothing more than a shameful cameo.. H20 is suspenseful, well written, and well acted. Good job!!"

I saw it before the other Halloween films and so I thought it was the greatest thing I'd ever seen. Truthfully, it is not a bad horror movie. Hartnett and Williams are a lot of fun to watch and Jamie Lee Curtis never disappoints. The problem is that nothing beats the first Halloween and to even try is a fruitless endeavor"

      "text": "Heaps & miles above any other Halloween installment trying to succeed the original. Though this film in many ways is unnecessary, it serves as a decent sequel to the original and perhaps even surpassing HII as the better sequel. H20 serves as the true Halloween 3, but only quickly highlights HII's events. This film references more to John Carpenter's Halloween and almost acts as a tribute to that film (and perhaps even Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho.) H20 probably doesn't deserve praise, but Jamie Lee Curtis is back as Laurie Strode to take on Michael Myers. It's a revenge movie, but no where near as good as Mother's Boys- both of which are personal guilty pleasures of mine."

It totally ignores Halloween 3, 4, 5, 6 (good for them).The story was simple and screenplay was also not upto the mark. Action and violence is was not so intense. The direction was good but simple. Among the actors, only Jamie Lee Curtis did better job.Overall, HALLOWEEN H20: 20 YEARS LATER does everything right, but with a lot of flaws."

      "text": "Jamie Lee Curtis returns in what was probably the last enjoyable film in this series until David Gordon Green's 2018 sequel and what should have brought the series to a close. From the start, the film ignores Halloween 3-6 and acts as if they never existed and instead plays out as a sequel to Halloween 2. Its a very good sequel and probably the 3rd best of the series next to the original, you can tell the director tried here to undo the Cult of Thorn mess and bring Michael back to his more mythological ways where instead of being a unstoppable mass murderer who rips the heads from people's bodies. Plus I really enjoyed the score here and the atmospheric close-quarter shots, it reminded me a little bit of the original Alien as it brought a certain tension and chill to the film that hadn't been seen since the original. The only problem here is the film runs short at 90 minutes and could have benefited from being at least 10 or 15 minutes longer with more content."

      "text": "The true sequel to Halloween II, it tries with great effort to utterly defecate on any quality that the preceding sequels hadn't already deprecated Curtis reprises her role, as does Nancy Stephen's. However the former obliterates any memorable qualities her character possessed, while the latter exasperates the trivial featuring of her character's existence. While failing to falter into the cesspit that the previous entries dug, it fails to deliver scares or quality that the first two films established (more-so the first.) Halloween VII is best viewed in trilogy format with the first-two, if you understand you're going from an \"A\" film to a \"C\" film to a \"D\" film. Please with all love ignore the final film in the franchise, unless you're open to experiencing rest to the franchise (literally)."

      "text": "The first real showdown of Jamie Lee Curtis's Laurie Strode and Michael Myers happened 20 years after the original film and it's fun but not much more. Getting the brilliant Kevin Williamson of Scream to jump on board was a smart decision to capitalize on the smart slasher craze of the era but in truth it's only mildly successful. It does nothing to really correct any of the franchise's inconsistencies unlike the 2018 version. It is however a hell of a lot of fun. They take in joy in playing up the expected cliches as well adding to the meta execution with stuff like Janet Leigh a.k.a. Psycho a.k.a Curtis's real life mom complaining about the shower drains and driving her original car. After a series of decent kills we move on to a short but effective finale where the two behemoths go head to head. Something completely ruined at the start of the next film. Sexy Josh Harnett, future Oscar winner Michelle Williams and LL Cool J hamming it up also star. Michael himself is different and I'm not sure I love it. He seems mindless and a little goofy with a spiky hairdo and I do wish they used the iconic score more instead of reject Scream tracks. All in all it's a bit of mindless fun that closes out her story nicely."

But this actually a good movie it takes back 20 years of Jamie Lee Curtis' Character \" Laurie Strode\" it's a good Steve Miner film i am not sure if the original   director of halloween John Carpenter had a different view of the story though. Grade A\r( i am a huge fan of Carpenter 's halloween series there is so much things that halloween can reveal about Myers  tell the unthinkable film of halloween)."

The story itself is interesting, continuing what Halloween II (1981) ended with, but the implementation is very poor. Almost nothing happens throughout the entire movie. You can safely go about your business and return around the end of the film to understand who is who and what will begin now. If, for example, we compare it with the very first film, then there the tension grows very gradually, and I really liked it, but in this part, unfortunately, it\u2019s not even close. The film only saves Jamie Lee Curtis, only because of her you can watch it."
