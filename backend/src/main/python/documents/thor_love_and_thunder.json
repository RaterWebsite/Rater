A four hour movie that was tossed into a blender and only two hours were poured out, without bothering to make them coherently connect.  If you can think, then almost everything in the movie makes no sense, especially the big threat which invalidates Infinity War/Endgame.  Typical MCU, where canon and continuity are not part of the FRANCHISE so nothing can make sense, and there are no stakes.

Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman were great in this. Where the movie falls down is it gets very cartoonish with its humor there were some parts that made laugh admittedly but unfortunately a lot more parts that made me cringe and took me out of the story. Christian Bale did what he could with Gore but his arc felt a bit rushed and not fleshed out. Zeus felt like more of a punchline rather than a powerful god it was like the parts that should have been serious in the movie couldn't be as the movie was sort of stuck in cartoon mode.

I'm not a conservative nut job and am generally open minded but I fail to see why sexual references (hetero or otherwise) need to be in a movie like this. It's just jarring.

The movie is criminally unserious it\u2019s a **** joke. Gorr knocks it out the park from the jump but as soon as the Marvel Studios logo rolls it\u2019s all downhill from there, tonally. Thor and co. are written like an actual Muppets skit, complete with fighting literal Muppets within the first 10 minutes. Star-Lord gives this unusually out of character and frankly garbage pep talk to Thor that doesn\u2019t really pay off at all when Thor recants it to Jane later in the movie.For the great execution Christian Bale gives Gorr, he does ZERO God-Butchering in this film outside of the 5 minute prologue. They literally find out about this guy from a space Fox 5 broadcast labeling him Gorr The God Butcher while cutting through slides of dead god bodies.Janes\u2019 handling is great overall I think, but Marvel clearly cannot keep things interesting inflicting trauma on woman characters. Post-credit stuff was great though so I\u2019m cautiously optimistic.Overall this movie felt entirely disrespectful to Thor fans, like a parody Monty Python-ification of the typical slate of MCU one-liners and gags. Decent action sets and rare moments held intensely together by Christian Bale alone don\u2019t save what is otherwise the weakest entry of Phase 4 without a doubt and possibly my least favorite MCU movie of all time."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Two hours of the worst jokes and premises the director could cram in.

In total honesty, gone are the days where I'd become excited and overjoyed for the newest MCU film. In my eyes, the MCU's golden age ended with 'Avengers: Endgame' and it just hasn't been the same since. For the most part, we've been plagued with films that simply feel like obvious afterthoughts or expertly-written epilogue fanfiction at best, and this one is no exception. Riddled with an absurd amount of corny moments including but not limited to flying/screeching Taylor Swift goats, Thor riding his Stormbreaker axe like a witch on a broomstick, Thor caught in a jealousy love triangle with his old hammer MjoInir and his Stormbreaker axe and talking to them quite often throughout the film, random accents galore (Valkyrie now suddenly has a British accent and Russell Crowe's Zeus's accent is beyond silly, all over the place, and impossible to pinpoint), etc. The list goes on and on. Not even the performances can really save this one, as Hemsworth remains charming yet goofy to a fault in this one, and Bale's Gorr simply loooked and felt like a Voldemort ripoff. For me, the film's biggest standout star was Portman's Mighty Thor. Watching her carry the hammer and kicking ass was incredibly fun and satisfying to watch. The Guardians of the Galaxy also make a brief appearance at the beginning of the film that felt fun but mostly rushed and wasted unfortunately. Like I said before, the story and writing simply feels like fanfiction material at this point in the MCU and the stakes and emotions never feel as high anymore. So overall, while it's big, bright, and does have its fair share of enjoyable action sequences and a solid action performance from Portman in particular, this 'Thor' still feels like too much of a burnout like the rest of Phase 4 of the MCU has felt so far for the most part and is simply just a jumbled and corny mess."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "Add a review here for Thor: Love and Thunder, or submit with only a rating...I would say only one thing \"This is the death of Marvel!\" Missed stan lee and hope if marvel studios create something more relevant and logical."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "This was a weird movie.

Apenas uma viagem espacial da cabe\u00e7a do Taika Waititi. E bem, a\u00ed \u00e9 subjetivo, mas pra mim, entregou na perfei\u00e7\u00e3o.Pra esse filme eu n\u00e3o tive a mesma ansiedade, comprei o ingresso tardiamente e at\u00e9 me descuidei e acabei lendo uns coment\u00e1rios do pessoal que tem acesso antecipado. E pelo o pouco que j\u00e1 li, me tirou qualquer hype ou expectativa. Acabei embarcando nessa hist\u00f3ria esperando ser apenas mais um cap\u00edtulo dessa fase 4, apenas mais um epis\u00f3dio de um s\u00e9rie da Marvel do Disney+, e, sob essa vis\u00e3o, acabei me surpreendendo o quanto eu estava curtindo cada minuto de proje\u00e7\u00e3o.Primeiramente, o filme \u00e9 LINDO, s\u00e9rio. Pode ter algum CGIzinho ou outro meio m\u00e9, mas no geral, o design de produ\u00e7\u00e3o e a cinematografia est\u00e3o ESPETACULARES. A dire\u00e7\u00e3o est\u00e1 bem competente tamb\u00e9m, n\u00e3o adiante, o Taika entendeu ESSE Thor do MCU e do que ele precisava pra funcionar nas telonas. Ouvi alguns coment\u00e1rios de profissionais sobre uma certa dissocia\u00e7\u00e3o entre os momentos \"s\u00e9rios\" e \"c\u00f3micos\" do filme, falando que faltou tato no diretor nesse aspecto. Bom, quem sou eu, mas sou obrigado a discordar, posso precisar de uma revisita pra avaliar melhor, mas a primeira experi\u00eancia pra mim foi muito flu\u00edda, eu mal senti o tempo passar. Achei toda a narrativa muito bem amarrada e natural. Talvez uma ou outra piadinha que se estendeu demais, mas nada que mate o filme.Indo para os atores: de maneira breve, todos bem. Chris est\u00e1 obviamente se divertindo demais no personagem, ele virou o Thor, n\u00e3o tem jeito, j\u00e1 \u00e9 da fam\u00edlia (piadinha ruim, mas quem viu o filme vai entender*). Natalie Portman volta revigorada pra franquia, com um arco melhor constru\u00eddo e em um filme onde ele pode se soltar e fugir o arqu\u00e9tipo de \"mulher do protagonista\". E, um \u00faltimo que eu quero comentar, \u00e9 Christian Bale; rapaz que personagem bacana e como o ator parece a vontade em interpreta-lo. Os trejeitos, o olhar, a voz, tudo convence demais. Novamente, parece que a palavra chave do filme \u00e9 divers\u00e3o mesmo, porque Bale transparece estar adorando voltar a fazer filme de her\u00f3i (mesmo que ele tenho dito no passado que nunca mais faria).Bom, se n\u00e3o tem do que reclamar, porque n\u00e3o a nota m\u00e1xima? Bem, n\u00e3o \u00e9 s\u00f3 porque eu n\u00e3o esperava nada, que eu acho perfeito qualquer coisa. O filme \u00e9 bom, divertido, en\u00e9rgico e tocante. Mas \u00e9 muito \"pouco\". Veja bem, estamos numa escalada no MCU, cada vez mais as hist\u00f3rias est\u00e3o maiores e mais complexas. E quando digo maiores, \u00e9 em tempo de tela mesmo. S\u00e3o filme que beiram 3 horas, s\u00e9rie que passam das 6 horas. A\u00ed chega num filme grande desse, menos de 2 horas \u00e9 inadmiss\u00edvel e eu senti isso o filme todo. Thor PEDIA mais tempo de tela, Jane PRECISAVA de mais tempo de tela e o Gorr MERECIA mais tempo de tela. \u00c9 tudo muito breve, \u00e9 tudo muito \"f\u00e1cil\", n\u00e3o existe uma escalada, uma montanha-russa emocional. Os personagens mal conversam direito. E \u00e9 a\u00ed que eu entendo as cr\u00edticas as piadas do Taika, afinal em t\u00e3o pouco tempo, ele ainda um parte consider\u00e1vel pro humor (que eu gosto), mas que na hora de botar no papel e somar os resultado, acaba pesando demais.Por fim, \u00e9 um bom filme, n\u00edvel Guardi\u00f5es 2 eu diria, mas muito pela minha baixa expectativa (talvez at\u00e9 por eu ter acabado de maratonar v\u00e1rias s\u00e9ries MCU do Disney+).*se n\u00e3o entendeu ainda assim, pesquisa o nome daquela atriz que aparecesse no final."}], "recommendations": ["shazam_fury_of_the_gods", "deadpool_2", "guardians_of_the_galaxy", "zombieland_double_tap", "minions", "thor_ragnarok", "baywatch", "black_panther_wakanda_forever", "zoolander_2", "pitch_perfect_2", "hancock", "kingsman_the_golden_circle", "the_twilight_saga_breaking_dawn_part_1", "dolittle", "the_a_team", "poseidon", "suicide_squad", "terminator_genisys", "the_cobbler", "the_green_hornet", "burn_after_reading", "the_men_who_stare_at_goats", "tusk", "deadpool", "justice_league"]}
