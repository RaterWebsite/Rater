Its not the grime like many horror flicks, it deserves atleast a one watch - I shockingly admit I was not in any interest in its prequels, having seen the second I did not enjoy it, yet I liked this one seeing it as requiring no depth, its action and flow is still logical for entertainment purposes. critics stuck this one right inbetween though, right where it belongs, in the middle."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "So how does the filmmaker improve on Jason Stratham jumping his car onto a moving train from a bridge? You coax Burt Reynolds out of action movie retirement and put him behind the wheel to thwart Smokey one last time. Frank Martin needs a moustache. He needs a ten-gallon hat, too. Any man with the balls to jump disjoining train cars, should at the very least, let out a lusty \"yee-haw!\" while cheating death. It's not that hard to imagine a retooled \"Smokey and the Bandit\" looking a little bit like \"Transporter 3\" if Hollywood decided to remake the best-remembered car chase movie from the Reynolds oeuvre. In today's market, bigger is better, so probably the Bandit would have to do something more pressing and continental than be the transporter of beer over county lines. In the Hal Needham \"classic\"(well, to be fair, maybe it's the \"Citizen Kane\" of the \"good ol' boys\" genre), Sally Field existed solely as the love interest; she was just along for the ride. In an updated \"Smokey and the Bandit\", the love interest would be more integral to the plot, like Valentina(Natalya Rudakova) is, even though Frank and the film itself collude to Sally Field her, initially, by not revealing why the Russian(sorry, Ukranian) girl is making the cross-country trip with him. Like \"Hitman\" before it, European locales helps immeasurably with a whole lot of banalities, because they're banalities enmeshed in atmosphere. In \"Transporter 3\", a car hurtles over a Budapest cliff before exploding in flames."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "I enjoyed the action scenes, but the dialogue was pretty horrible.

I went because of the relatively high metacritic rating, but it is an absolute stinker. In my opinion, anyone who loved the original will detest this third installment. I would go into detail about which aspects of the film were the least pleasing, but there simply is nothing to compliment regarding this \"work\". Please do yourself a favor, and avoid this movie at all costs."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "EPIC. FAIL. Seriously, one of the worst movies I have seen in my life. The CG was awful, the dialogue was AWFUL, and the action scenes (especially anything with cars involved) were laughably unrealistic. You know a movie is terrible when they have to fast forward the car chase to make it more exciting."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "It's rare for me ever to review a movie but this one definitely is worth reviewing. Simply stated, this movie is a let-down for the series. First, the plot didn't flow well. Also the dialogue was quite subpar. Though the love interest in the movie is not a very good actress, she was the only thing that held my attention other than the three good action scenes. Imo, I'd wait for the DVD."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "Watching this movie in a theatre was one of the few times I've experienced the urge to get up and leave half an hour into the feature. I wasn't alone on this; a few people in the theatre actually left, and the friend of mine who came with me had leaned over and said \"hey man, we should just go and play Forza or something\". I'm as big a Jason Statham fan as the next guy, but this was just plain BAD. A reviewer had said the plot was \"needlessly complicated?\" That's insane. If anything, some complexity could have turned this movie from bargain bin to 2/$25. The 'villian', who was somewhat overacted by Robert Knepper, wasn't clever. At all. This should be a crime. The 'love interest', who was incredibly and sulkily underacted by Natalya Rudakova, wasn't even cleverly vapid, but just plain stupid. The entire time I was watching the \"sexually tense\" interactions between Statham and Rudakova, I felt like i was watching a thirteen year old hit on her dad. On top of that, her character's shallowness was only overshadowed by how poorly the role was acted. (She also suffers from a strange condition in which she's not overly attractive until she puts on her \"i want to S your D\" face.) It would have also been in the best interests of the writers to not attempt to invent a new James Bond. Frank Martin's line of work and personality are apt for him to, ironically, never have a real personality. The role works as a steeped-in-mystery-with-no-personal-details affair, but he shows too much weakness all of a sudden for this movie to work well. It was such a boring, contrived shell of what could have been something somewhat compelling, even if it IS 'just an action movie'. As the ending drew near and the plot became more and more transparent and predictable, I still rolled my eyes at the \"saved by inflating a dufflebag with tire air underwater\" and \"jump an Audi S6 onto the roof of a moving traincar.\" I gave it a 1/10 simply because even though the Tarconi character was as badly scripted as the rest, Fran\u00e7ois Berl\u00e9and is still funny by default (except the line \"Russians.. they're always so dark.\"This made me want to destroy the one person in the theatre who laughed at it)."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Its better than the second one but still everything you see in this film, you have seen in its predecessors.
