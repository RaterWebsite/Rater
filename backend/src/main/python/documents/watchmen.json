The Dr. Manhattan \"penis\" shots were not gratuitous by any means, they were simply shots of him walking around. Hardly sexual, merely biologically natural. Secondly, the sex scenes involving Silk Spectre were far from gratuitous, they were side shot intercourse scenes with limited nudity, and nothing more than stylized sexual thrusting. Finally, I'm much more disturbed by the fact that this bothered you more than the excessive gory violence that occurred throughout this movie. I mean, limbs getting cut off, heads getting impaled. I would much rather that my child saw a little nudity and some sex scenes (which are natural human qualities and biological functions), than disgusting nihilistic violence (which is not a natural human function, and only breads hate and desensitization to the movie-watching crowd). The American public has it all wrong. While we should make sure that our children are indeed protected from adult sexual material, we should be much more concerned with the graphic violence that has permeated our culture and allowed people to grow sadly tolerant of it. That being said, the movie was indeed a faithful, wonderful adaptation of the novel, with only a few points lacking (i.e., the depth of some of the characters was never realized).

Contrary to what the Alan Moore worshippers think, I thought this was excellent.  This is up there among the weirdest and most visually exciting flicks ever.  The story mixes both a dark, semi-realistic take on the super hero genre with alternate history.  The tale is built up around 4 unforgettable characters: the Comedian (imagine if the Joker was one of the good guys, but retained his nasty nature), Dr. Manhattan (a super-superman created in a radioactive accident), Rorschach (an uncompromising crime fighter with a mask made up of ever shifting Rorschach ink blots), and Adrian Veidt (a cold genius who comes up with a unique and horrible way to save the human race from itself).

The cast's acting throughout this movie is pretty solid and so is the dialogue, the dialogue is really good.Also, the action sequences throughout this movie are very graphic, brutal and gory but they're outstandingly good, especially that prison cell scene.The cinematography from Larry Fong is pretty good and he captures the scenes pretty well, either that being a scene with the main characters or a graphic action sequence.Finally, the movie's got a great soundtrack, I think that's another positive for this movie, it's got some amazing songs from start to finish.The only two negative's, I've got with this movie would have to be why does Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) sound so much like Batman throughout this movie, don't get me wrong he's a brilliant character throughout this movie but why does he sound so much like Batman.The final negative, I've got with this movie would have to be, why the **** did they use Simon and Garfunkel - The Song Of Silence. The song doesn't make you feel sad at all, all it does, is that it makes you feel the complete opposite. It makes you laugh instead of feel upset, the reason being for this is because on how much it's been memed to death, lol.Overall, Watchmen is a brilliant movie. The movie's got an amazing plot twist, pretty solid acting, great dialogue, very graphic and brutal action sequences. The movie's also got some pretty good cinematography and it's even got a great soundtrack. It's honestly worth the watch, I'd highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys very graphic and brutal movie's with an amazing plot twist."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I learnt about Watchmen when I was in my first year at college. One of my friends had recently received the graphic novel as a present and he would often bring it. I was curious to know what the graphic novel was about, so I looked it up, and that's how I discovered this movie. I wasn't much into superhero genre before this, so I decided to take a look at it. Back then I thought this was a great story, and after having read the original graphic novel, I think it's a great adaptation.In the opening scenes the Minutemen are summarised with the song \"For the times they are a-changin'\" playing in the background. It was so cool to watch. It doesn't matter whether you like Zack Snyder's movies or not. One thing you do have to admit is that his opening scenes are always awesome. And this one is the one that absolutely nails it.The costumes have been made either very faithful to the comic book counterparts like those of Silk Spectre II and The Comedian, or have been improvised as in the case of Ozymandias and Night Owl II. Dr Manhattan's \"thing\" is surely a bit distracting, but I was able to ignore it after a while. Rorschach was my favourite character in this movie. The one criticism this movie gets is that he was portrayed to be a badass dude instead of a self centred hypocrite that he was in the graphic novel, and I completely understand this. But I also like this interpretation. Since most of the story is centred over Rorschach figuring out about The Comedian's death, he has to look as interesting as possible in order to keep the audience engaged.Another criticism this movie often gets is that it was unable to capture the visual essense of the graphic novel, which I completely disagree with. The graphic novel has an 80's styled drawing. Why would you want this movie to be made with that style? It is a good thing that this movie didn't go for the same visual style. This criticism is the equivalent of \"why Wolverine doesn't wear his comic book costume in the movies\". Dude things have to be changed in order to be adapted on the big screen. It's also the reason why the giant squid was replaced with a nuclear bomb. A giant squid sounds very funny instead of serious. No country would take any big action in case that happens.If you're watching this movie for the first time, I'd say you should try the Director's Cut first. If you have no problem with the length of the movie and you can see and understand everything that you see in complicated movies, I'd say you should go with the Ultimate Cut. I watched the Ultimate Cut. Initially I was bored because of how the story was dragging on, but slowly everything started to make sense. I really like all the action scenes in this movie, and often go back to watching it just for the old time's sake."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This is my favorite \"superhero movie\" of all time. I didn't watch it for a year or two after release, because of low critic scores (and mature content, I was like 15 at the time).I'm glad I eventually gave it a chance though. Its very dark and adult, definitely not for everyone, but in my mind its as true to the comic as an adaption of this work for the big screen could be. Some notable changes were made, one in particular was controversial with comic book fans, but I view these as necessary for the comic to work in a modern movie. The acting is great, the dialogue well-written, the score is perfection.

For some comic fans that might be a terrible sin. All I can say is the movie works for me, specially the ultimate cut with the animation segments.I heard someone on youtube -can't remember who- say that while the comic was a commentary on superhero comics, this movie is a commentary on superhero movies, which does make sense when you think about it."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "An amazing take on a comic masterpiece.

The glowing blue man with the transluscent appendage needs a pair of pants, like the lemur from \"Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa\" needs pants. Adrian(Matthew Goode) probably doesn't mind that the homoeroticism of \"300\" escaped its reels and found a new home, in which Dr. Manhattan's nudism probably throws the other Watchmen into a homosexual panic. Quite pointedly, Adrian seems to know Dr. Manhattan(Billy Crudup) better than Laurie(Malin Akerman). While the girlfriend claims that the ultramarine entity is devoid of any compassion towards mankind, Adrian's alter-ego, Ozymanidas, notices the worry creases in the former Jon Osterman's face whenever he's vexed. The Alexander-wannabe watches men, closely. But Laurie should be one to talk, the daring rescue of some people trapped in a burning high-rise that she and Dan a.k.a. Night Owl(Patrick Wilson) attend to, seems more about correcting her new beau's impotence and gettin' their middle-aged ya-yas out, than being selfless and valiant in a derring-do mission in the night air of this alternative New York. It's mere foreplay: the superhero suits they run around in are nothing more than provocative get-ups to get them in the mood. There's something faintly \"Seinfeld\"-esque about Night Owl and Silk Spectre, and \"Watchmen\", in general. Like the characters in the Larry David-created sitcom, these superheroes are more interested in saving their own skins- Rorschach(James Earl Haley) warns the other Watchmen about an assassination plot- than saving the skins of others. How apropos that there's a Comedian(Jeffrey Dean Morgan) present. During the interim years of Allan Moore and David Gibbons' breakthrough graphic novel being stuck in developmental hell, Terry Zwigoff's adaptation of Daniel Clowes' \"Ghost World\" had already lured a portion of the literati into accepting the long-form comic book as a viable art form. \"Watchmen\" won't convert the holdover naysayers(who pooh-pooh the thought of the comic book as literature, although Allison Bechdel's \"Fun Home\" and Adrian Tomine's \"Shortcomings\" are changing more minds), which is a crying shame, since in most fanboy circles, this is the standard-bearer. While it falls short on vision, \"Watchmen\", more or less, holds your interest for over two hours-plus, and that's no small feat. But still, the bloated thing lacks true transcendence(for instance, the Saul Bellow army won't lay down their dog-eared copies of \"The Adventures of Augie March\" for this); it's just a comic book movie, albeit a reasonably smart one(not smarter than \"Ironman\").

Not only do they include the only stupid element from the book (Jon's ability to see into the future which I fully expected them to keep) but they also changed some things for the worst. For one, unlike in the book where there is some foreshadowing but the twist is still somewhat of a surprise, this movie gives away the identity of the villain pretty much from the beginning. Also, they give the characters superhuman abilities for some reason that, other than one minor glitch in the end of the book, never actually existed. Rorschach can't leap 10 feet into the air at will, Adrian Veidt isn't a superhero, etc. This not only made a dark and realistic world silly but it also made the closing sequence of the film incredibly retarded. And speaking of Veidt, this was by far the worst casting of all of the characters. In the book, Adrian Veidt appeared to be a \"larger than life\" person, not just in terms of his celebrity and persona but also in terms of his physical appearance. The dude was a big, strong, and intimidating person but Matthew Goode looks like a dorky little twerp. Malin Akerman also wasn't a great selection but she at least pulled of the role of Laurie Jupiter decent enough. The rest of the casting was fantastic and they nailed the style of the book spot on. The soundtrack was also really good. Honestly, other than the Adrian character in general, they really stayed very true to the book. It's just that this story is so reliant, not on action and effects but rather on the development of the characters and the world itself. And while they developed the world really nicely, I think they failed to develop Dr. Manhattan enough and his back story is really one of the key turns in the book. Overall I think they gave it a solid effort but it just doesn't have the same impact.

She was almost raped by him, and then it's revealed she went and had sex with him. I am assuming this is put in to reflect the distorted mentality of today's society? Or was it just to make Silk Spec cry?\rI still cant understand the attraction between Silk Spectre II and Dr. Manhattan, both of which appeared several times naked  the first to hold the male audience's interest (I assume) and the second only made the audience giggle and laugh, detracting from the film.\rJackie Earle Haley's portrayal of a sociopathic anti-hero was definitely the highlight of the movie. Again, these \"heroes\" appeared more interested in the fight than actually helping mankind (JDM's Comedian a bright example of this). This notion is revoked in the end, when even a distant Dr Manhattan is \"moved\" by the devious actions of Ozymandias, all in the name of mankind. Well, that settles it then. Forget democracy, bring in the world's smartest men to lead us, otherwise we are just savages that ultimately will kill each other to extinction. But if we are indeed savages, mankind and heroes alike, what's the point in saving us in the first place?

It wasn\u2019t a better world. Behind their masks and glowing eyes, the heroes Moore conceived and created with artist Dave Gibbons were hindered, and occasionally crippled, by the same conflicting impulses, childhood traumas, and redirected neuroses that drive everyone else. Moore and Gibbons\u2019 graphic novel Watchmen helped redefine the types of stories superheroes could be used to tell, not just by freighting them with darkness\u2014too many subsequent creators showed how easy that could be\u2014but by weaving their capes and gadgets into a dense, deep narrative: a detective story played out against the apocalypse in a world so thoroughly realized that Charles Dickens would be jealous.\r The same elements that make Watchmen a great book made a Watchmen film a difficult prospect. (Moore, on principle, removed himself and his name from the project, which probably didn\u2019t help.) It\u2019s remarkable that any Watchmen movie made it to the screen, after the years of false starts and litigation. And the one we got\u2014directed by Zack Snyder, most recently responsible for the ably made, philosophically dubious Frank Miller adaptation 300\u2014deserves credit for staying true to the characters, plot (up to a point), and look of the original material while still generating his own kind of energy. Sometimes that energy feels misapplied and overcranked, as the roar of the action drowns out the film\u2019s human voices, but Snyder\u2019s Watchmen keeps moving so assuredly, it\u2019s nearly impossible not to get swept along.\r Keeping Moore\u2019s alternate-universe \u201980s New York setting, Watchmen opens with the murder of The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), a long-serving crime-fighter with a late-career sideline in covert ops. (The film keeps Moore\u2019s dark joke that electing Nixon to multiple terms is one of his world\u2019s problems.) A masked vigilante named Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley)\u2014the only one who didn\u2019t hang up his disguise when the government outlawed civilian crime-fighters in the mid-\u201970s\u2014launches an investigation and uncovers a much larger conspiracy, one seemingly tied to mounting nuclear tensions between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R., as well as a bunch of Rorschach\u2019s old colleagues. These include the Silk Spectre (Malin Akerman), who inherited the title from her mother (Carla Gugino); Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson) a bookish, wealthy master of machines; Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), who\u2019s since turned his remarkable intellect to acquiring wealth and power; and Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup), a lab-accident-created glowing godlike being whose connection to humanity remains an open question.\r There\u2019s sometimes too much Dr. Manhattan in Snyder\u2019s Watchmen, which often feels like a feat of engineering first, an artistic expression second. But his source material keeps him grounded, as does solid work from Crudup, Wilson, and especially Haley, whose performance evokes pity, fear, sympathy, and revulsion as he goes about his single-minded pursuit of justice without compromise. Others bring less. Given a central role, the lightweight Akerman serves as an    Andie MacDowell-in-Four-Weddings-And-A-Funeral-level distraction, and Snyder isn\u2019t always well-served by his tendency to start at 11 and try to turn up the volume, particularly in a bunch of over-the-top, bone-cracking action scenes. The time spent developing watchmen-fu would have been better invested in not blowing one of the book\u2019s big Mars setpieces, or figuring out a better alternate ending than the one dropped in the original\u2019s place.\r And yet in the end, the film\u2019s ambitious drive to create a dread-soaked alternate America and people it with flawed, recognizable heroes carries it along. Snyder uses grand gestures to create a sense of world-imperiling doom rooted in another era, but equally at home in this one. But he also remains willing to slow down to capture the gravity of a funeral, or dwell on a moment between old partners patching up a friendship as doomsday approaches. Moore\u2019s touch emphasizes how messed-up and needy comic-book people would have to be to do what they do.
