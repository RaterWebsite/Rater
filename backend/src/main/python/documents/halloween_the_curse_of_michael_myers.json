Harris stated in an interview that when her agent learned that filmmakers were looking to cast an actress who was at least 18 or older to play Jamie in this film, she was only 17 but wanted to do the movie enough that she got herself legally emancipated from her parents at the suggestion of filmmakers so that she could work longer hours without having to go to school. Harris spent time and thousands of dollars on the legal process, but ultimately turned down the film due to her own dissatisfaction with her character's story and Dimension's refusal to pay her a salary that would have recovered her legal fees. Harris also stated that she eventually met and befriended J.C. Brandy, who took over the role of Jamie in the film and was treated poorly on the set because Harris turned down the role."

This entertaining but flawed sequel has some definite lapses into weirdness with the druid stuff the Myers worshipping cult. But I love the feel of the movie. It's one of the more seasonal entries of the bunch. It also has a creepy, dread inducing atmosphere and it's quite stylish in its execution. The cinematography and rock version of the theme are cool and Paul Rudd is fun and sexy as a grown up Tommy Doyle. Sure it's filled with cliches and it's all a bit goofy but it's another solid entry in the Myers franchise."

      "text": "John Carpenter's 1978 'Halloween' is wholly deserving of its status as a horror classic. To this day it's still one of the freakiest films personally seen and introduced the world to one of horror's most iconic villainous characters Michael Myers.Which is why it is such a shame that not only are all of the sequels nowhere near as good but that the decline in quality is so drastic. Ok, the original 'Halloween' is very difficult to follow on from, but most of the sequels could at least looked like effort was made into them. 'Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers' is a prime example of this, a film with very little to recommend and just very poorly done in many areas.Starting with the very few good things, Paul Rudd and Donald Pleasance, in his last film before his death from heart failure not long after (although his screen time is far too short and was clearly severely truncated), come off in a good way in the acting department.The exploding head death is a pretty fun one and the setting is eerie. As far as praises go, that is it.'Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers' was directed by someone who had an apparent dislike for Pleasance, the main reason for his limited screen time most likely, and had no interest in directing the film or the 'Halloween' series in general, and it shows loud and clear on screen. Even the direction in 'Season of the Witch' and 'Halloween 5' wasn't this indifferent or inept.Sadly the effectiveness of the setting, which actually is eerie, is hindered by the filming and editing being pretty amateurish, the photography often is far too dark and drab and the editing makes bacon-slicer-like editing seem coherent in comparison. The music, like the previous film, is here a drawback when it was one of the better elements of the first four films. Here it sounds cheap, goofy and would have sounded out of date even in the 80s most likely.Everything looks, sounds and feels like it was made in a rush and with absolutely no heart, accounting for the constant sense of incompleteness. There is nothing scary or suspenseful, it's unintentionally campy, uncomfortably strange and by the numbers with a convoluted story that makes no sense whatsoever, an abrupt ending, dull pacing and the man in black/cult plot that is just bizarre and just muddles everything. Michael Myers is just not creepy enough and looks goofy.Very like the previous sequel, there is nothing interesting or endearing about the characters (though none are quite as annoying as Tina in 'Halloween 5'). The script especially sounds incomplete and the acting, apart from Rudd and Pleasance (whose screen time, as said, is far too short), is subpar to put it lightly. J.C. Brandy is a pretty poor replacement for Danielle Harris.Overall, don't expect any terror, scares, fear or thrills here, you'll be disappointed. 3/10 Bethany Cox"

      "text": "The movie had WAY too much potential to be what it was. Honestly, the film is like a 4, but I'm rating it lower because it could've been a 10 movie. Jamie Floyd and her arc was probably the best part of Halloween 4&5 (I liked her more than. Laurie). However, they tossed that away with a pointless death scene in the beginning despite being the protag for two straight movies.What? Excuse me? But Why? That moment beginning alone summarizes the rest of the movie. The writing had interesting elements (I know I am in the minority, but I like the Thorn Curse plotline), but it needed more time in general. The plot is unusually intricate, which is unique for a slasher, but it needed to be explained better as it seemed to be confusingly rushed in. As a result, I can only imagine that the people who DO care are scratching their heads at what information was given, and the people that DON'T care are annoyed that you wasted their time with a convoluted plot in a slasher film.The acting was cheap, a good deal of the scenes were cheap, and the beginning was en media res, expecting you just to go along with what supposedly happened between Halloween 5&6. The ending was another \"muh inconclusive\" ending which honestly is just silly as we've been here far too many times. This might just be me, though.Micheal was okay...even if he teleports and now has some weird and unfair sixth sense to find relatives. The kills are nice. So if you're just looking for a dumb, cheap slasher flick, the movie is still good for that. However, there are plenty of other slashers if you're looking for that, as Halloween lost its competitive edge back during 5. Anyways, sorry for seething, but I am just hurt to watch such potential go to waste because the producers didn't want to put the effort, time, and money into a movie that requires high ambition to work."

I just couldn't help but think that this film could have been so much better. Turn it on, sit back and let it happen, it\u2019s fine."
