A ce sujet, les invraisemblances se succ\u00e8dent sans sourciller le long d'un sc\u00e9nario rocambolesque qui pr\u00eaterait presque \u00e0 rire s'il n'\u00e9tait aussi navrant.On s'emmerde donc \u00e9norm\u00e9ment dans ce thriller bidon qui n'a d\u00e9cid\u00e9ment rien pour lui, y compris Freeman coinc\u00e9 en mode \"minimum syndical\". Las de lever les yeux au plafond, on \u00e9teint bien avant la fin !"

      "text": "Long before Tyler Perry turned Alex Cross into an action star, the all-star detective was portrayed correctly by the legendary Morgan Freeman. While the first film, Kiss The Girls, was a huge success, it's sequel, Along Came A Spider was a bust, once again due to the fact that the strengths of the character were not utilized properly. The character of Alex Cross was created by Author, James Patterson, and has been responsible for over 20 best selling novels, because he's unlike any other cop in any other mystery series. Cross is a psychologist first, who gets inside the heads of killers. Once he knows what they're thinking and why they're acting the way they are, Cross is usually able to capture them. These stories make for terrific novels, but when transferred to the screen, producers felt that they lack the action movie goers crave. Despite a successful first appearance on screen, the producers felt that with more action and bullets, the sequel would do even better, they were wrong. When a Senator's daughter is abducted from an upscale private school, detectives are at a loss, but call Cross in when evidence and a ransom demand turn up at his house. Cross believes the criminal is using his admiration to cover up the real motives for this crime, and he needs to play into that role, in order to determine what those motives are. This was a terrific novel, but wasn't right for the screen, so much of the story was cut and replaced by the manhunt and police chases. These elements make for a more intense film, but don't do justice to the story. Alex Cross and his abilities are the story and are what make the series unique. Morgan Freeman returned hesitantly to do the sequel and he was right when he said he shouldn't have done it, mainly because it takes away from the brilliance of the first film. The producers of this movie even managed to screw up a terrific surprise ending and that really says it all. Along Came A Spider is not a bad film, it certainly has it's movements and a legendary star, but if you're a fan of the Alex Cross novels, expect to be disappointed."

      "text": "Along Came a Spider is a very average entry in the Alex Cross series. While Freeman provides a little wit and poise for the movie, it is hard to overlook the plot holes, non-sensical writing, and overall silliness of even the most basic plot points."

      "text": "Along Come a Spider perfectly retains suspense for a thriller, then the dynamics of the plot sags. Typical scenario of kidnapping a small child of an important person. It may seem that there is nothing in the film, then for some time the plot twist worked out and I was surprised as a viewer, unfortunately this is less and less in modern thrillers."
