However, judging it for what it is - a film - it's not good. The dialogue and the way characters act is cringey and done in a way that is so forced. It tells us what we already know, then that's it.None of the characters stood out to me. Of course Vivian (Hadley Robinson) and Lucy (Alycia Pascual-Pe\u00f1a) are the two main stars of the story. The former irritates more than anything, while the latter is poorly written - e.g. for the first 15 minutes or so she's pretty unlikeable, before belatedly and out of nowhere becoming pleasant; in and around Vivian & Co. I mean, not Mitchell (Patrick Schwarzenegger) obviously.A shorter run time as well as a bit more depth and creativity with the characters/plot would've went a long way. It's nothing absolutely terrible, granted. Lastly, cool to see 'The Walking Dead' alum Sydney Park (Kiera) involved."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Netflix'in klasik feminist filmlerinden biri.

This movie highlights realistic events that happen to teens in high school especially for the women there. We're told what to wear and what not to wear because the boys can't control themselves. Instead of telling the girls to change their clothes and make them ashamed of their bodies, educate the boys on self-control and manners. This movie shows the importance of that message and I as a teenager myself fully felt connected to this movie. Sure it had some classic cheesy parts but that's what makes it a movie in the end for teens and the production world."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "A great shift into coming of age movies that we need in this day and age.
