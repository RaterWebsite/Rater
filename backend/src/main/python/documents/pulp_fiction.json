This film is about the highest level of perfection you can achieve in the category of gangster films. Led by smart, controversial directions, \"Pulp Fiction\" spills in racism, mistakes, faults, God, and redemption into the game of crime. It's simply astonishing to do such thing, which makes the film a long living masterpiece in film history."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "I'm surprised about how this overrated piece was critically acclaimed by countless viewers. They compare it to Scarface, Kill Bill etc and it isn't even at the caliber of any of the above.The movie is perfect in every way, except the plot. Despite the movie's issue only covering one field, PF just lost four points out of 10 because of filler that lasted for an hour. That filler constitutes of a scenario and a hangout. The scenario being Butch's part and the hangout, where the chick has zero involvement with the plot (if it has any). My father once asked me what Pulp Fiction is about and even I can't answer. Simply told it was an action/thriller starring Travolta and Willis.In short, the plot is not present, despite the unique \"chronologic\" system, which is a really good move. If this movie has a proper plot, I would've given it a 10."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Best movie ever..hands down!"}, {"rating": "0", "text": "No meaning, no scenario, not funny at all.

One of the best movies of all time. The thing that makes this movie so great is that it doesnt take itself too seriously. Yes the jokes help this movie out a lot, but who cares the jokes are classic \"Royal with cheese\", \"Big Kahuna Burger\" \"La Big Mac\" that opening scene of the movie is classic and probably one of the best parts of movies of all time. So many classic lines from this movie and its also well acted and directed. Its a crazy movie, that doesnt make sense, but it doesnt try too, and for those of you who say its too long, go watch a Disney movie or one the horror movies out there today, maybe their more your type of movie, you dont have to think as long."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Funny and entertaining from beginning to end.

I actually saw Kill Bill before this movie so I was having high hopes that Quinten would pull of another masterpeice, and my hopes were met. The movie characters were witty and realistic. Some scenes(the gun accidently going off) were the most hilarious things I have ever seen. Sharp dialogue, clever editing. There just isn't alot this movie has going against it, besides the fact that there is no real strong storyline going for it. But that is where the beauty of the film lies, it just feels like we are actually following these guys around on one of their, most likely, not so better days. Does life itselfs have a grand storyline that we all need to follow out? No, and neither does this movie, making it all the more better. The dialogue is also perfect. The hamburger conversation feels like a conversation you would find me and my friends having on a normal day. The only complaint I have about this film is that the second chapter, with the boxer, seemed a bit out of place with the other two chapters. Maybe if they threw in a bit more of Vincent or Jools into the chapter it would have fit in a bit better. With that minor Quipe aside, Pulp Fiction is a movie that is more than just a movie you need to see, you have to see this film or forever be haunted by the awesome that got away."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "About as perfect as a film will ever get.

This was the movie that revitalized American cinema in the mid 1990s... though it would have been nice if other directors took his example for inspiration rather than just becoming copycats.

Maybe it was non-linear? in which, I can appreciate that they went against the grain with this, but both me and my buddy were watching this film thinking.

The dialogue is non-sense (too much blah blah for nothing), the acting is mediocre at best and there is no action, no emotion, not a good and interesting story with bad guys etc. It's not funny at all. Ridiculous. It's not a garbage but it's too overrated. I have seen better movies from Tarantino, like Kill Bill (better by far), Inglourious Basterds, Django Unchained, Jackie Brown and Reservoir Dogs. Death Proof was good too. The Hateful Eight was as mediocre as Pulp Fiction, which means....a huge dissapointment! Only the music is great."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "I feel bad for everyone that saw this movie after hearing all the hype and praise.

Look, I can like films with just talking. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is one of my favorite films, and that's all they do. But at least in that movie, what they were talking about was interesting and funny. Pulp Fiction is neither. It's just people talking with nothing to back it up. Not even the outrageous and shocking scenes don't hit that hard. You don't care about anything, you don't laugh, you don't get excited, you don't feel ANYTHING. At least the plot comes around in an interesting way and there are some memorable moments. But one is for sure.

But I don't think that any serious viewer -- or at least any viewer with an opinion worth considering -- will grant Pulp Fiction its rightful place in the canon. That doesn't mean the film is perfect or that reasonable viewers can't differ on its relative strengths and weaknesses. Those who find the dialogue too steeped in post-modern hipsterism, however, can still marvel at a non-linear storyline that may best \"Citizen Kane\" in its elegance and ingenuity. Those who find some of the plot twists (think Gimp, baby) too contrived can still appreciate performances -- and character interactions -- whose artistry will stun audiences for many, many generations to come. In other words....hell, that guy below is right: If you don't find something -- or lots of things -- to love about this movie, see a doctor.

Tarantino established himself as one of the most stylish and individual directors alive with this masterpiece of pop cinema, which combines several stories involving a vivid array of characters who could only be seen in a comic book. The dialogue is fantastic (one of the best and most entertaining screenplays ever), the performances are fantastic, and the soundtrack rocks throughout the entire movie. This is one of the key films in American cinema, and should be watched and loved by anyone who calls themselves a fan of the movies."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "I seriously don't know what to say about this film. It was mind blowing. It was very well written. I loved the dialogue especially the beginning scene in the dinner with Tim Roth. The best part of the film has to be the directing. With Quentin Tarantino there's no way that it's sucks. The stories of different people connecting simultaneously has been bone before but not as good as this masterpiece. John Travolta dying at the middle of the film and walking out of the dinner at the end was very well planed out. This film doesn't even fallow the same time period. Don't forget about the violence. It was very violent and bloody. This film deserved to win best picture at Oscars over Forrest Gump. I don't have much else to say so what are you still doing here. If you haven't seen the movie go see it and if you have seen it go see it again."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "The greatest film ever made.

Fantastic screenplay, terrific actors to the point of the tiniest roles (Steve Buscemi as a waiter or Christopher Walken as an ex-soldier) and a marvelous kind of story-telling.

It is an intense, sexy, addictive crime/comedy/drama that warps into overdrive and thrown into the hands of one of hollywood's greatest directors and producers that puts crime into something so addictive, nobody can resist. It's like watching a sex scene on steroids while drunk.
