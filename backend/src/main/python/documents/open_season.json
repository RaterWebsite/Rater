      "text": "Let's face it. Pixar and Dreamworks Animation are still both the kings of CGI animations (Pixar's movies weren't bad. However, only one CGI movie from Dreamworks was bad, but some of their films turned out to be as good as Pixar's films). However, year after year, in the middle of the 2000s, other CGI animation studios tried to cash in by releasing their own CGI animated features. This is one of them and trust me, it was that bad and I was shocked to see that it was made by Roger Allers (director of Disney's The Lion King). (sigh) I'm going to talk about the plot first before I make my opinion and some of you already know what it was about.\r Boog, a grizzly bear, lives in a perfect world with a park ranger named Beth. One day, he saves a deer named Elliot from a hunter and one night, he returns the favor by helping him escape from his owner. Realizing that Boog has reverted to his wild nature, she releases him in the woods before hunting season begins. Boog and Elliot make a bond not only for themselves but for the other animals in the forest as they rally them up to drive the hunters out of the forest.\r This was the first CGI movie from Columbia Pictures and at their first try, they were unsuccessful. The characters were very annoying, the dialogue was just plain laughable, it had a lot of overused clich\u00c3\u00a9s and there were a lot of plot holes.\r I will give Columbia Pictures credit for the CGI animation and art design, but they were overshadowed by a poorly written storyline, same old slapstick jokes, and really pathetic acting.\r For the kids, it's worth watching, but as for others, it isn't. It's just a stupid CGI movie with no character and no plot at all. That is until it was followed by two sequels. Two sequels? Two sequels?! This clich\u00c3\u00a9d, unfunny movie had two sequels?! Oh, goodie. I want to see how much they suck just like this one.\r 2/10"

      "text": "Open Season is a passable first film. While it is a b-grade version of the buddy comedy story it is not terrible. Half of the duo works and some of the fish out of water humor and side characters work. The animation especially on the backgrounds is pleasant to look at and makes you feel like you are nature. The buddy comedy doesn\u2019t work as well as it could\u2019ve as the writers choose to focus more on making a lot of jokes especially from the Buck rather than giving us heart and reason to care. Had the film given more heart in this area or focused on the park ranger who is the far more interesting character we could\u2019ve had something here. Open Season isn\u2019t bad. Kids will like it ok and parents will occasionally chuckle; but it\u2019s nothing worth remembering or watching again. It\u2019s a passable first film but nothing that can give Pixar, Disney, or Dreamworks any reason for concern."

      "text": "Open Season is the first movie from Sony Pictures Animation. There are two ways you can evaluate a movie like Open Season. The first is to simply judge it as a film. Is it any good? The second is to ask whether or not your kids will like it. This review (and any review I write) will approach it from the first perspective because let's face it, if the movie has talking animals in it your pint-sized terrors are going to love it. Children like anything, as long as it's animated and they've received enough sugar before viewing it. That's great for parents, since it means they can plop them down in front of the television and entertain them for hours with discount straight-to-video DVDs, but it's not so great for the rest of us since it gives Hollywood a license to print money without having to bother with earning it by making something good.Open Season for instance, is not good. The idea it's based on might have been; a computer animated comedy about animals taking back the forest from hunters could work. But the movie takes so long in getting to hunter torture that you'll find yourself bored to death long before the first animal finally rips off someone's underwear. When the melee finally does happen, you won't laugh because you've seen all the best bits from the film in the trailers. There's nothing there beyond the advertisements except a lot of time spent watching a bland bear and a fast-talking deer knockoff of Shrek's pal Donkey, wander around in badly rendered CGI circles.The bear's name is Boog (voiced by Martin Lawrence), and he's a tame bear. Anyone who's seen Grizzly Man might find themselves a little uncomfortable with this notion. People who think their bears are tame generally learn the hard way that they are in fact, not. Luckily, this is a family movie, so Boog's owner Ranger Beth avoids ending up looking like she's beaten a wookie at holographic chess. Instead, she gets a clue when Boog allows himself to be lured into busting up convenience store by a wild, one-horned deer named Elliot (voiced by Ashton Kutcher). Beth realizes her bear buddy needs to go back into the wild, and drops Boo and Elliot off in the woods right at the start of hunting season.Right away they're pursued by a particularly knarly hunter, and seeing him butting heads with Boo and Elliot might have been fun. But it's at least thirty minutes into the film before we even get to the forest, and once we get there the majority of the rest of the story is spent watching Boog and Elliot get lost, and wander around in circles. After awhile, the movie starts repeating itself. Boo and Elliot lose their way, a bunch of gags ensue, they figure out where they are again, only to lose their way once more and repeat the same gags. It feels like Steve Bencich and Ron J. Friedman, the film's writers, were stretching. They had an idea, but couldn't make it long enough for a feature film and started padding it. The result is a movie that's only 99 minutes, but feels like it's about 207.The worst thing about it is that Sony's Animation Division really isn't up to the challenge of making a decent looking computer animated film yet. That might be forgivable if the story was better; great story and great characters can easily overcome technological limitations, but Open Season doesn't have that. There are a few interesting moments, like a clever scene in which Boo and Elliot encounter a herd of ill-tempered deer and even better there's a funny pit stop for a chat with a group of surly beavers. But even those good moments are wasted, since the film fails to build on them or take them anywhere that pays off. Will Open Season make a lot of money? Will your kids love it? Yes. Is it a good movie? Not at all."

      "text": "In the peaceful town of Timberline, 900-pound (408 kg) grizzly bear Boog enjoys a captive, but pampered existence and spends his day as the star attraction of the town's nature show while at night living in the garage of park ranger Beth, who raised him since he was a cub. One day, the sadistic hunting fanatic Shaw drives into town with the one-antlered deer Elliot strapped to the hood of his truck. Boog frees Elliot at the last minute and against his better judgment, before Shaw can go after him. Boog never expects to see his \"buddy\" again. Elliot follows Boog home and finds him sleeping in the garage and starts to throw rabbits at the window. He tells him to be \"free\" from his garage captivity and introduces Boog to a world of sweet temptations outside of the garage that he has unknown. When Boog becomes sick from eating too many with candy bars, events quickly spiral out of control as the two raid the town's grocery store. Elliot escapes before Boog is caught by a friend of Beth, police officer Gordy. At the nature show, Elliot who is being chased by Shaw, sees Boog who attacks him, causing the whole audience in the show to panic. Shaw attempts to shoot Boog, but Beth sedates them with a tranquilizer gun before he can. Shaw flees before Gordy can arrest him for shooting a gun in the town. The two trouble-makers are released into the Timberline National Forest, only three days before open season starts, but they are relocated above the waterfalls, where they will be safe.Since he lacks any outdoor survival skills, Boog reluctantly takes Elliot as his accident-prone guide to get him back home to Timberline to reunite with Beth. But in the woods, they quickly learn that it is every animal for itself. The two run into their share of the forest animals including skunks Maria and Rosie, ducks Serge and Deni, panic-stricken rabbits, the Scottish-accented squirrel, McSquizzy and his rogue gang, Reilly and his beaver construction worker team, a porcupine named Buddy who is in search of a friend and the herd of deer led by Ian and Giselle (who Elliot is in love with) With each adverse encounter, Boog learns a little about self-reliance and Elliot gains self-respect and they start to become friends. Day by day, Elliot attempts to lead Boog out of the forest, but it becomes evident that he has no clue where they are going. After winding up at Reilly's dam, Boog and Elliot are confronted by Shaw, Boog then loses his toy bear, Dinkleman, as the current makes the doll flout out of Boog's paw. They end up in a waterfall, which floods and sends the forest animals falling down it.At first everyone blames Boog who accuses Elliot of lying to him about leading him home. Elliot admits he thought that if Boog spent time with him, he would befriend him. Boog leaves to unwittingly find Shaw's log cabin. Shaw returns and talks to his gun \"Loraine\" and says he would take back what is his, discovers him (like Goldilocks and the Three Bears), and pursues him to the city road where Boog happens upon the glowing lights of Timberline. Instead of deserting his companions, Boog helps the other animals defend themselves using supplies taken from Bob and Bobbie's (two \"scientists\" looking for Bigfoot) RV while their pet dachshund Mr. Weenie joins the wilds. The next day, Boog leads a revolution against the hunters, sending them running after McSquizzy blows up their trucks with a propane tank named \"Mr. Happy\". Shaw returns for a final confrontation and shoots Elliot in the process, which enrages Boog to tie up Shaw with his own gun. Boog rushes over to Elliot's body but soon finds that Elliot survived the shot, only losing his second antler in the fracas. Beth returns to take Boog back home where he will be safe, but instead he stays with his friends and all of the animals in the forest.During the credits, Shaw is seen tarred, feathered and tied on the top of Bobbie and Bob's RV, who mistake him for Bigfoot."
