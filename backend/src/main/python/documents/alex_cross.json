      "text": "In a departure from his previous efforts, Tyler Perry tries his hand as an action star in \"Alex Cross\" with mixed results. Playing the title role, Perry gives a credible if unremarkable performance.  Just like his previous performances in his own films in non-Medea roles, his acting lacks range, subtlety or depth. Rather than create a nuanced performance Perry indicates his character's emotional state through obvious gestures such as nose flaring and tearing of the eyes. On the story front, \"Alex Cross\" is a generic buddy cop film with Edward Burns as his partner. As typical of buddy cop films they are an exercise in contrasts. Perry is the sensitive family man that's not afraid of showing his emotional side while Burns is the macho ladies man. Much of their exchanges involve banter along predictable lines. Perhaps the best thing about the movie is Matthew Fox as the main villain. A complete sociopath, his character is the perfect antagonist for the emotional Perry. For fans of action films, Perry's Cross might be a little too much in touch with his feminine side. Also, Perry, while a big guy, lacks the athleticism to make his more physical scenes interesting. This is the most evident in a climatic fight scene. It is shot in a very stylized way as if to hide Perry's lack of brawling skills.\r With the exception of one particularly gruesome torture scene, the PG-13 rated \"Alex Cross\" is pretty tame for an action film. Tyler Perry fans aside, \"Alex Cross\" is best for video and only after other choices have been exhausted."

I rented it on Amazon and it was one of a handful of films that made me regret renting it within 5 minutes. It is shallow, cliche, pretentious. I had never seen Tyler Perry before and based on the trailers was willing to give this a chance. I regret that choice."

While maybe not the worst movie from that year, the terribly mediocre script doesn't do this stinker any favors. Tyler Perry is sometimes okay, and the supporting cast isn't all that bad. Alex Cross is really a simple revenge story masquerading as something better."

You didn't like the movie Alex Cross which was a really good thrill ride, but you like the movie that's my boy, oh how mind boggling.  Argo didn't seem all that good, besides it was on the news 30 years ago. All you have to do is read a 30 year old newspaper about the story, hello!Those people do not know a really good movie if it fall right out of their ass wholes. This movie was very exciting and very thrilling. It is most certainly different from watching the same damn movie over and over. They make the same movie over and over and many people get sick and tire of seeing it. Paranormal activity is about the same as those other scary movies. About a hunted house and spooky ghost and scary monsters and people being hacked up to death and blood and body parts falling off. Alex Cross was a very thrill ride and very exciting movie. I think it was very exciting just like the book series. I really don't know what those people are talking about, because they weren't watching the same movie as I. I am so confused?"

But rebooting Morgan Freeman's Alex Cross character may be as boring as Atlas Strugged Part 2.\r Both Alex Cross movies like Kiss the Girls and Along Came a Spider were two of my favorite movies from best-selling author James Patterson. It's 2012, so after an 11-year stint, how come Tyler Perry made a choice to replace Morgan Freeman's character? Look just like Taylor Kirsch and Colin Farrell, Tyler Perry is not an action star. Eventually, his cameo appearance in Star Trek may look like Levar Burton from Star Trek: TNG. Anyway, there's no way I'm gonna see Alex Cross. It's really half-mediocre and half-Madea."

How this borderline tortureporn got a PG-13 rating is beyond me.  I felt bad for the talented actors who had to say those lines.  I look forward to seeing them in better projects in the future."

Tyler Perry is a decent enough actor but I just couldn't buy him as Alex Cross. The rest of the cast was pretty mediocre in terms of acting ability. Matthew Fox played a believable sociopath but he was about the only plus character in the film. There were also far too many plot holes for the story to be interesting or believable. A movie that could've been emotional, dramatic, intense, and intriguing was none of the above. I also thought some of the cinematic effects were below par. Overall this was just a disappointing movie in general."

      "text": "As a long time fan of James Patterson's Alex Cross novels, I thought Morgan Freeman was the perfect choice to play Cross, and I loved Kiss The Girls. I was weary of a remake, especially one done by Tyler Perry, but to my surprise he was much better than expected, unfortunately, the film was not. Alex Cross has always been about beating criminals with his mind. The forensic psychologist is best known for his ability to out think rather than over power his opponents, but you'd never know it by watching this film. Alex Cross and his team are called in on a triple homicide, but the suspect had more on his mind then just his targets, and sets his sights on Cross and the team. There is a heavy focus right from the beginning on the bad guy, who we immediately see is Matthew Fox. To me this took all the mystery right out of the story, and instead of being a who done it, the film was about how to catch the bad guy. The writers didn't do that right either, as Alex Cross is blinded by rage and goes out guns blazing to fight and kill the assailant. While this may make for an exciting action film, it's not who or what Alex Cross is all about, and despite all the novels I've read, I felt like I didn't know the characters at all. Tyler Perry stars as Cross and shows that he's more than just a comedian dressed as an old woman. Perry was very intense and likeable, under different circumstances I would have really enjoyed his performance, but again, he wasn't playing the Alex Cross I know. He's paired with Lost's Matthew Fox, who has played the bad guy before. I love Fox as an actor, but he just doesn't have the look or temperament of a killer and wasn't very believable here. Alex Cross is one of my all time favorite characters, and the first time they put him on film, they did it right. The second time, wasn't one of Patterson's better stories, but still very well done. This time, Alex Cross has turned into John McLean, and while some people will love it, to me it just emphasized everything that is wrong with Hollywood today."

Alex Cross is basically a detective story about talented detective who is trying to catch a murderer. That all. You wont be invested in this movie. Every few minutes I was looking at my clocks, painfully waiting for this film to end. And all this boring scenes, they go on, and on, and on. Well, it's not the worst film of 2012, at least I don't think so - I haven't seen a lot of other movies. I don't expect much from Paranormal Activity, but the point is - Alex Cross is not good. It's not the worst movie you will ever see. It's simply below average."

      "text": "I can't say I was overly impressed by this film. For a start, I should perhaps say that I've read the majority of James Pattersons' Alex Cross novels, a couple of years or so ago. I remember hearing about this film coming out at the time, so I had high hopes for it. I've seen previous films starring Morgan Freeman, which weren't too bad, so I wondered how this would do.I found this film in general to be very formulaic - the villain is certainly easy to despise, both sounds and looks sinister and is very sudden and hyperactive, with a high level of bloodthirst, which will no doubt put some people off. The graphic, bloody content, violence wise, is somewhat gory but its not what I'd say is especially original or new as such. I will have read the novel(s) the story is based on, although I can't recall exactly which ones they are but I remember thinking at the start that it seemed a bit confusing, in that there wasn't much background given to the characters or explanation in general given to what was going on. It was a bit like watching an episode mid-way through a series, or a second film from a trilogy franchise. I couldn't help but feel that this film was quite sloppily handled, in terms of the script, the amount of character development provided and so on. I noticed there's a fairly heavy use of stringed music throughout to accentuate the slower, sinister scenes, as well as faster frantic scenes featuring more dance style pieces, with heavier bass lines. It was quite an engrossing watch in general, when the various fight scenes come on and trying to guess the outcome of certain situations but again there was something that made it feel almost lazily formulaic. I suppose if you've seen the other films based on novels about this character, for example Kiss The Girls, then you'll have a good idea what to expect.This is a pretty watchable, sometimes quite engrossing watch but yet it definitely lacked some substance - maybe its just that I'm not so keen on gory violent action films but I don't think its purely that. Having read the books about this character, I can't help but feel that this potentially could have been much better. There's a sentimentality that comes across as somewhat forced and it just doesn't really 'gel well', the mix of both sentimental, family and relationship related scenes alongside the more gory, violent scenes.This film has a running time of around an hour and fifty minutes, which is probably about the average for this type of film. I'm glad it wasn't too much longer, as I have a feeling it would have become quite tedious. Its a shame, as I think this could have been a much better film but it just didn't seem to work well.Funnily enough, no I wouldn't recommend this film. It is fairly engrossing and I suppose its an easy watch but its definitely lacking substance. There are other psychological thrillers and action films that I've enjoyed a lot more - in this instance, I'd probably think of Denzel Washington films, their quite similar to this and most of those are better than this too."
