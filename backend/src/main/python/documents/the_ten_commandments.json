      "text": "As is typical for most Protestant productions, or ay religious production, is that they eyes are too big for the stomach. While this film would do quite well in the bin next to the typical Disney rip offs that come to DVD, in a movie theatre you see that the there were two things missing from this production: A budget worthy of a 3D Animation effort and a director that could direct their voice actors to their characters. As long as the Christian community sees fit to produce home video that does not challenge the mind, eye and senses and continues to put out sub-standard, decade old feeling movies, then their intentions will constantly fall. I firmly believe that God can use anything to His glory, but it says a lot for the Christian film industry and their lack of effort, talent and budget."
