      "text": "A terrible, NOT scary, and practically un-followable film. For example, the young Chinese child? There is no explanation to why he is there, nor why he has a black cat with him? Also, if the grudge thing kills people, how did she survive when it appeared under her duvet cover? When Yoko climbs into the loft close to the beginning, and sees the grudge things head, it is just...not scary. I've seen scarier things in children's movies. The jumpy edge to the film is almost non existent, and therefore, there is no horror in the film whatsoever. I do say, the scene in which the grudge thing is following her around the building is mildly scary. Although, how it got out the loft is beyond me. I personally think that, this is a poorly made film. If your'e looking for a real scare, try Blair witch (not the sequel, Blair witch 2 was far worse than the grudge) and Paranormal Activity. 1/10. Why? It managed to get me tense enough to jump when someone opened the front door."

      "text": "THE ONLY POTENTIAL SPOILER IS THAT I DESCRIBE THE ESSENCE OF NEARLY ALL Japanese HORROR SCENES)\r The rule of thumb for watching any Japanese horror film that is remade in Hollywood is to go for the original, subtitles be damned. The one exception is The Ring.\r The Grudge remake, made by the exact same director of the original, is a series of confusing, disconnected creepy scenes until the end where you kinda-sorta get an explanation. No plot. Just typical stupid horror movie characters doing stupid things. \"Oh, let's go check out that really creepy sound all by myself after I found my wife/mother/girlfriend/pet dead/catatonic/(insert-state-of-being-here).\"\r Having seen nearly all the Japanese horror flicks, there is a clear culture of fear of long black hair, water and eyeballs or mouths that are stretched/blacked out via PhotoshopCGI. When you experience it for the first time, it's scary. The second time, it's interesting. For the third, fourth,  it's yaaawwwwwnnnn."

The only thing that would be impressive is if anyone can catch on the psychological aspect, which drives the film to a new low. Weird events keep happening and the only thing I can think of is \"When will it get interesting?\" The tone above all is different from other horror movies, and the simplicty of this is what happens, and this is what is going to happen, doesn't suit well with me. And the bad acting from the cast doesn't help either. The sequences of the demon attacking people and screwing their lives is the only thing that holds the movie together."

She wouldn't stop chasing you until she kills you. Also, she will appear anywhere, your sheets on the bed, in your closet, mirror, hoody, THERE IS NO ESCAPE!\" and then they never answer that b/c they would be scared. A lot of people say The Ring is scarier...I don't understand how though. The Ring only had 1 terrifying scene, but the rest of the movie was dialogue. It shouldn't be compared to this!

Had a friend over to watch it with me the 3rd time. She was so scared, I had to go to her apt. to look in her closets and under her bed after the movie. She slept with the lights on that night. Not sure why it's getting poor reviews from some folks - maybe sometimes you aren't in the right frame of mind. Try watching it alone in the dark. Honestly can't figure out why Roger Ebert gave it a 25% rating. I'd like to see a list of all his horror movies that he's rated higher than this. He couldn't be more off the mark."

The pale little boy is creepy (if you aren't fed up with pale children from a host of similar movies). The plot, the acting, the mood - these are all generic, certainly nothing fresh enough to have necessitated it being a remake. If there is one annoying person who likes to make fun of movies in the theatre, they will make fun of The Grudge - and it's really the sort of movie that attracts those kinds of patrons, too."

This is what happened in a certain house in a residential neighborhood of Tokyo, where there are mysterious deaths happening. After a visit, the young American Karen Davis begins to feel haunted and will research the history of the house, in search of a way to ward off the evil that pursues her. Directed by Takashi Shimizu, this film is different from almost everything I've seen in horror: what frightens us is the depth of the permanent tension felt throughout the film. Okay, I've never seen the original so I cannot see how close it is, but it did not fail to impress me. The script is good, the story is interesting and make me remember of \"The Ring\", with all the focus on investigating that dark history. Sarah Michelle Gellar is the protagonist, but she does not make a particularly interesting performance, like none of the actors. Despite this, it's a worth watching horror movie."

      "text": "I'd say that the most comparable movie of its type, to this (that I can think of anyway) is The Ring and if I were to compare the two, The Ring is a better movie, in my opinion. This movie is a horror/thriller which very much relies on the constant sinister element to keep you on your toes, to keep you watching. There's heavy use of violins to create the suspense, the buildings seem quite sort of  'clinical', there's alot of greys, alot of dark shots where your left trying to follow the line of sight of the characters on screen, searching for clues as to where the sinister noise is coming from, although it isn't just the strange noises that peak the interest but you can tell the characters on screen feel compelled somehow to follow some intangible aura...creepy, huh? ehh..I do tend to be sceptical of these sorts of movies but having seen a few, I really don't think this is among the best. I kept watching the movie yet I kept feeling that I simply 'wasn't buying it', which is for a variety of reasons, which I'll explain now.I'd say that the first reason for this is that the story, as it unravelled, became confusing to me - I say this in as much as the scenes kept cutting between different time frames and I found it hard to keep track of the timeline. I thought the characters and the roles they played were also a bit unclear at times, although that may be more down to me not keep proper track.I also didn't find it very believable (surprise, surprise(!)) in terms of Karens ability to escape the situations she found herself in. I do like a good thriller that grabs you and you feel compelled to follow it through to see the final outcome for the main character, the good guy/gal but I only bedgrudginly watched it through to the end as it reached a point where it felt quite predictable and I could have guessed the ending.Another issue for me was when the 'curse', this sinister element was shown visually on screen - maybe I'm a bit harsh as a critic but I have to say, I found it more comical than genuinely scary. It may have been better if they hadn't included the ocassional scene showing the 'deathly' or 'otherwordly' figure, it kind of spoiled it for me a bit - in movies such as The Blair Witch Project, it works due to the fact that its up to us, the viewer, to have an image in our minds of what this unspeakable horror is but we get a few too many glimpses in this movie and I simply didn't feel that it worked well.What I think did work pretty well were some of the shocked faces, the stoney, lifeless expressions that appeared throughout. Unfortunately, overall I feel there's little credibility to make up for it really - it has quite an American feel to it and knowing it was based on a Japanese/Asian original, this is another of those movies where you hear that the original is much better than whats seen by some as a lazy remake making use of a popular cast to basically partially guarantee revenue - I imagine the original is alot scarier, with a higher age rating to reflect that. I'd say that this movie doesn't scare me but thats not to say that it couldn't instill fear in other people, it does have a bit of a sinister feel to it and some scenes would certainly scare if not disturb younger viewers, so I would definitely not encourage children to watch it, but if this type of movie is your 'kinda thing', I'd say there are better examples out there.It seems only fair to mention, after the criticism I've given towards the film, that I didn't feel compelled to switch it off, there was something about it which was rather eery and peaked my interest somewhat, although I didn't by any means feel like I was right at the edge of my seat, I did follow it through to the end and as such I feel it would be perhaps a bit harsh to give it a 1 star rating. I'm also aware that movies like this with this sort of story aren't entirely my cup of tea (I do wonder why I keep watching them I suppose but even so, I recognise what I believe to be better made examples of this type of movie) but others can get more 'into them' and as such, I'm going to slightly give it the benefit of the doubt and issue it with a 2 star rating but given I've seen similar movies which I felt more 'involved with' and I felt had a more original plot, I just can't say that this is worth considering above them, so I have to give it a low rating."
