The 2 sequels are pretty bad and this 3rd continues the slide in quality. It's set in the US, where a new super-conservative party has come into power and announces the \"experiment\" to deal with growing national problems. This paranoid political premise drains even more life from the series. What I wrote in my review of the last one still applies: \"Once again, the situations are absurd and the action is mostly dull and uninventive. Some of the auxiliary scenes are artistically shot or visually inventive, but that doesn\u2019t elevate the quality. It\u2019s not exciting. It\u2019s not scary. It\u2019s a disappointment.\" These films have just become an excuse for gratuitous violence."

      "text": "I didn't see the other \"Purge\" movies, and thought on bargain day I might as well to see what the buzz has been about.    Well, I can't say anything about the others in the series, but this movie is nothing but a thinly veiled ultra racist diatribe as the first Purge takes place in the poorest parts of Staten Island, NY.    It makes no bones that African Americans and a few Hispanics for racial diversity's sake, I suppose will be the targets of a horrific 12 hour rampage of genocidal race motivated insanity.    I for one am no racist - I hate those types with a passion, just like millions upon millions of good people of all ethnicities and races do.    We want harmony.    We want fairness in our economic and societal structures, and all the good things that come with those who have the brains and capacity to reserve judgment on our fellow humans as individuals and their actions, not race, religion, sex preference, etc.    \"The First Purge\" either overlooks or pointedly refuses to acknowledge that fact.    The dichotomy here is so divided it's insulting.    As if the idea of the first purge isn't bad enough, the film depicts a stark line between victims and the \"purgers\", which, after a few inner murders of blacks on blacks, becomes a disgusting white ultra KKK fueled attempt at legal ethnic homicidal cleansing with no legal repercussions.    In this film, all whites are evil killers.    Even while the African Americans depicted are sometimes vicious drug dealers and users, they end up the heroes who successfully last the 12 hours to fight another day.    If that isn't enough, the short we see here while looking at the movie online shows a blatantly Donald Trump style \"Make America Great Again\" hat.    When will people understand that this kind of extremist stereotyping is a horrible idea for a movie?    It is not fair to anybody who deplores the Trump lovers out there as much as their intended victims of their hate and hostilities.    Had the writers at least acknowledged that the majority of Americans regardless again of race, religion, etc. detest the far right's message and behavior of its massively hate filled morons, it might have made the message a bit less divided.    Instead it capitalizes on the extremes of society, presents them as the majority, and serves only to galvanize the polarities that are already pulling this country apart.    Of course we who are not racist redneck imbeciles parading around in pointy hoods root for the minority community so viciously murdered in this bloodbath.    Others though are demented enough to think such an event would be great fun, and minorities would have some people too who would react negatively enough that they would not attempt to understand that the overwhelming majority of whites are on their side.    It's just the extremists who fall into this category, but they're out there, and in the face of mass murders in real life going on in epidemic numbers across the country, this idea is mind poison.    While some of the action is suspenseful and the fear that accompanies the purge is well represented, it's only that element that deserves the \"1\" rating.    I do not appreciate the implied assertion I am some hayseed illiterate racist hatemonger just because I am white.    And good hearted minorities do not appreciate the implication that no white people are ever to be trusted as friends, work associates or any other normal human relationship.    It's a terrible plot, and even more sinister concept."

      "text": "All the films in this franchise have been regular and bad, accept it, face it, don't deny it to me, but there is something I must admit. The first film did had in some way an interesting message. A message that was inevitably lost in the mismanagement of the plot and the story and the need to carry everything with violence but it's understandable because after all, the plot of the film dealt precisely with violence but it's not necessary for your story to become just that.The sequels, both the second and the third became something else, changed the scenario and became full-frontal action films and once again we cannot deny that the theme of the stories lent itself precisely for that, but evidently as I just say recently, in action films what becomes predictable also becomes boring and both films were boring, yes they did have action, you could call it entertainment somehow but how long can that last?This prequel doesn't change anything and in fact it's practically irrelevant that it is a prequel. It's true it offers the origin of the purge but was it necessary? no, it wasn't.It doesn't let you see anything that was essential or indispensable to understand the other films, therefore it's more of the same, with the same quality and as irrelevant and inconsequential as you can probably imagine."

      "text": "\u201cThink of all the good the purge does.\u201dIn 2013, the world was introduced to a small little independent horror film called The Purge. The basis of the film revolves around the idea that, for a twelve hour period, one day out of the year in the United States, citizens, residents and all Americans are able to do whatever it is that they like, without any punishment or laws, including and not limited to; violence, vandalism, theft, rape and of course murder. While the first purge film in the series was revolutionary and kick started a franchise that is now in its fourth entry, the first film unfortunately limited itself to being, quite simply, a thrasher home invasion film with the world of the purge harrowingly surrounding it; the potential for the series was behemoth. Thankfully, the film gained steam and momentum, and more films followed, with the original director and writers on board. With the second entry, the world of the purge was explored to the streets of Los Angeles, where motives of revenge and redemption were explored and showed how regular people handled the deadliest night in America. In The Purge: Election Year, the purge got more political (not that it never was), especially since the looming potential of a somewhat clueless President was on the verge of being elected (he didn\u2019t actually win, did he?).Politics and tongue-in-cheek social/economically charge commentary is something that the purge series isn\u2019t stranger to, especially within the last two entires in the series. But like any good planned B-Movie film series, the fourth entry in the series is also, technically speaking, the first movie in the series, a prequel. The First Purge is an interesting cinematic approach in terms of shock value, only because, the build up of whether the purge is a successful experiment is answered within minutes of the first film, so what is the point of this film?Writer and original director of the first three entries, James DeMonaco, who\u2019s love child is basically this series, decides to use the first purge film to show the divide between people and their thoughts on this \u201cexperiment\u201d. Sanctioned by the New Founding Fathers of America, the newest political party, who is coincidentally backed any the NRA (National Rifle Association), and developed by scientist Dr.Updale (Marisa Tomei), \u201cthe experiment\u201d (the initial name for the purge) was only taking place on Staten Island, one of America\u2019s lowest income and poorly populated cities (coincidence). If you stay on the island, you get paid $5,000. If you participate in the experiment, you get monetary compensation; if you kill someone, well then you get compensated generously. These are all incentives for the residents of Staten Island.While we quickly become familiar with the main inhabitants of Staten Island, we are also introduced to all the family drama happening on the island as well, for instance, the main protestor and the purge\u2019s biggest rival is the educated and powerfully independent Nya (Lex Scott Davis), whose ex boyfriend Dimitri (Y\u2019lan Noel) is Staten Island biggest gangster, and who\u2019s brother Isaiah (Jovian Wade) is secretly joining in the purge\u2019s festivities, to get back at a local crack addict for nearly cutting open is throat. While the streets belong to Dimitri, his heart still belongs to Nya, despite their past and current relationship woes.As the experiment commences, we quickly see that many of the people involved and brave enough to withstand staying, spend most of their time praying, socializing or partying on the island. With the exception of the freaky looking crack head Skeletor (Rotimi Paul), who fashioned himself his own Freddy Kruger inspired claws made out of needles, Staten Island and its residents aren\u2019t really purging as expected, unless you consider trap-music inspired street festivals as purging. So, like any good social/political experiment gone wrong in the United States, the government intervenes and sends out their own \u201ccitizens\u201d, ex-mercenaries to kill and rid of low-income residents on Staten Island and cleanse the American genome. You can imagine, Dimitri, the only resident on Staten Island who profits from other people\u2019s misery, isn\u2019t happy when the government decides to take out his clientele, so, like any good business owner, who goes out himself to rid of his corporate competition.There are many things wrong with the First Purge including the film\u2019s main antagonist and protagonists. Perhaps thats the point, I mean, even the woman who developed the purge has her own scene of redmeption, but then again, how is a person redeemed of concieving such a diabolical experiment, especially when she sells it to the most corrupt clients in the world, the American government?"

Returns to have the same plot as the previous, forgettable characters and things are explained that did not need a background before. Loose performances, very ridiculous moments (drones that shoot) and in the last act happens to be a movie of genre of action in the style of The Rock. I think he has a good start and there are scenes with a very well achieved suspense, but then he totally deviates and loses everything he was doing well. Marissa Tomei wasted.

You've seen the Purge, you've seen the Purge two, you probably haven't seen the Purge three but now it's prequel time so buckle up for the very first Purge.\u00a0Directed by Gerard McMurray and written by John DeMonaco, the same guy who wrote all the other purge movies. Also starring a bunch of actors who I'm not bothering to name, it's a purge movie, do you really care who's in it? Crazy, masked, knife wielding psychopaths, innocent victims and the evil corporate suits, yep it's a purge movie alright.The controversial experiment created by the new founding fathers of America (NFFA) is ready for a trial run in Staten Island. The experiment promises to reduce crime to below 1% for the rest of the year as long as people can release all their anger and rage in one night. Staying on the island for the purge is optional yet the majority simply couldn't afford to leave. On top of that, those who do stay are offered payment and others are strongly encouraged to participate with the promise of even more financial rewards depending on how much they participate. Very much taking advantage of the oppressed and marginalized. Participants must also wear tracking chips and high tech contacts for recording the first purge. They also make the wearer look like zombies, which adds to the horror theme, so bonus. Yet much to the disappointment of the NFFA the purge doesn't have the high level of participation expected at first. But when a whole group of new gangs show up and quickly escalate the purge it becomes apparent that this is more than just a sociological experiment.Gives everything you expect from a purge movie, extreme violence, violence while wearing masks and an unnecessary amount of jump scares. Although I think most of them came from the same person. One dimensional characters in a mediocre film. When it finally gets going it's entertaining in the moment but very forgettable afterwards.\u00a0I would say this should put an end to the purge franchise but if there's one thing these low budget horror movies can do successfully it's make a lot of money. Recommended for fans of the purge franchise."

I enjoyed the supporting cast of OGs.  The weak point of the story and the series is the band of nameless, faceless white dudes that are mostly all masked.

The First Purge was a movie excited for but unfortunately I was very disappointed.  The biggest issue with this movie is that it doesn't actually answer the question of how the first purge came to be.  It opens like every other purge movie and we start with a bad montage of violence and rioting and then 10 minutes later we get the first annual purge is starting.  The next big issue is the lead character, while though a compelling performance given the character he plays is completely uncomparable.  There is no reason at all that we would want to route for this man and his friends because they are all basically bad people.the action scenes in this movie are lazy and poorly made, the gun effects and sound designs sound like someone searched up gun noise online and made that the sound effect.  The odd decision to use cgi blood also doesn't help because it always looks bad and looks like blood from an old 1980's shooter, where someone blood always sprays from the one part even when their shot somewhere else.this movie is disappointing and is just another excuse to get more funds and is probably my least favourite of the bunch."

      "text": "I very much like the Purge franchise on a conceptual level. I think that the idea of the Purge offers up a very interesting premise that could be turned into some great movies. Unfortunately, though, the Purge movies (outside of the first installment) have not been all that great. They've been decent flicks to watch if you're bored one afternoon or just want to eat some popcorn and watch people die, but that's about it. The story of this one follows the cast of characters on the night of the first Purge. Given this, I figured that the beginning of the movie would give us a somewhat detailed look at how the decision to have the Purge came about. We are kind of given that, I guess. We get an incredibly cringey interview at the beginning between a doctor and a potential Purge participator that basically gives us the origin of the name, and the rationale behind the decision to have it is explained as well. But after those little tidbits, the film dives straight into setting up the characters. I like a lot of the elements of The First Purge's story: how the New Founding Fathers' motivations factor into the experiment, how the people on the island initially act when the Purge starts, and how the Government gets involved later on. It did what a prequel should: add more to the movies that come after it in the timeline. However, this film tries to be so, so timely with its social commentary, and it gets to be a bit much at times. And that heavy handedness really brought down my enjoyment of the film more than I expected. Also, outside of the Government being a bit more involved this time around, The First Purge turns into just another Purge movie around the halfway point. There's some nice action, and some death, but otherwise it's nothing new. The concept here was good, the execution...not so much.Characters: Dmitri (Y'lan Noel) is not only the best character in this film, but he's really the only character worth anything. He's the only one with any real depth, and it also helps that the actor portraying him has some real chops. All of the other main characters are completely two dimensional and are not particularly likable, either. I also have to say that I guess Blumhouse wanted to have as many crazy Purgers as possible in this film, but they are so over the top that they come off as people pretending to be crazy. One of the main \"crazy\" Purgers, Skeletor, is laughably bad. Without Dmitri, this cast would have been extremely weak. And, to top things off, Dmitri is a drug dealer...and he was the most likable character in the film despite not changing much by the end. That's something. Script: The writing for most of this film is horrendous. Extremely cheesy dialogue, but that's nothing new for the Purge franchise. Cinematography/Effects: Blumhouse is known for making decent looking movies on a super low budget, but I think that The First Purge may be their first film in a while that actually shows its low budget quite a bit. The sound effects are often recycled and sound like they came from a cheap sound pack, and some of the visual effects are downright terrible. If you see the film, watch for the blood effects in the scene that involves smoke grenades. It's not good. Cinematography wise, there's nothing special here, but it's decent. Overall: I was entertained by the action and most of the story of The First Purge, and I liked the character of Dmitri, but outside of those things this film is barely passable as a popcorn flick, even by my relatively low standards for Blumhouse movies."

Yet, what I find more important than the actual costume designs is from where these outfits arrive from and for which purpose each serves.\u00a0Film Editing: 6.312/10 Decent. The scenes are set up for its punches; the moments that draw the audience more into the story are set well and make for a more interesting project.

Otherwise, there doesn't seem to be much else going on.Visual Effects: 4.121/10 Seemingly forgotten. A snarky stab at technology.\u00a0Story: 8.297/10 The First Purge is mainly compelling due to it's strategically set story, acting\u200a-\u200aand its punches (check Film Editing). The story presses against drugs and violence within impoverished communities by imbibing them within its core developments. Yet\u200a-\u200athe story greatly emphasizes seemingly debilitating circumstances are not of the low-income communities themselves but processes of the government which the government has to fix in tandem with communities suffering the effects of government processes the most. I think the actual story has a lot of strong points (more in Personal).\u00a0Acting: 7.972/10 The acting elevates and fits the film. Dolores, Mugga, is hilarious: her role is set just right for the film. She's the only character that makes sense looking unscathed throughout the film. The sincerity of the acting is present which gives the film a necessary boost.\u00a0Personal: I feel as though the film attempts to reveal covert organizations within America that affect communities of diverse demographics as well as low-income communities. The lack of specificity concerning organizations throughout the film leaves one to speculate them as mercenaries or members wearing attire blatantly representing particular groups in America. Beyond the film reminding me of The Greenwood Encyclopedia of American Institutions: Fraternal organizations by Alvin J. Schmidt, The First Purge sets a firm stance against illegal activities within communities. The Other Wes Moore: One Name, Two Fates comes to mind as I watch Joivan Wade interacting with Freddy, Steve Harris, in the film concerning other opportunities available in their neighborhood besides slinging dope. The idea that communities have to help themselves as much as possible even without government assistance is ever present throughout The First Purge though The First Purge emphasizes that government assistance should not damper community growth for monetary gain. The First Purge focuses on sensible matters in a comical way which always finds disruption due to matters plaguing a community capable of existing happily though is unable to due to particularly draining aspects of society like addictions, overdraft fees, corrupt government practices, illicit activities, etc. A very strong subtle point is that illicit activities are already happening (as though certain individuals or organizations live like Purgers everyday though plainly or under the pretense of out-of-sight-out-of-mind) and (these certain individuals or\u200a-\u200a) organizations are manipulating media outlets as well as societal behaviors through financial maneuvers to promote their agendas. One might assess The First Purge as overly packed or appropriately scanning: I think it has a lot for one to bring to the table to dissect (though leaves one with a lot of ground work to cover due to the lack of specificity in the film concerning specific types of situations available\u200a-\u200a like the scene of brutality in a baseball field\u200a-\u200athe imagery is all one has to procure from).Overall: 6.459/10-K.D.If you're into Poetry and other bits of creativity, check out my Instagram: @Dufreshest."

Kept things varied and interesting. As forced as the plot may be, you do get to feel for the characters.Still, the dialogue could've been better at points. There are some very forced Trump references. The subplot with the government official and psychiatrist overlooking the Purge is by far the weakest, most poorly written part. The only saving grace in these scenes is Marisa Tomei, who manages to do a good performance despite rubbish dialogue.Yeah, I know the whole concept is goofy, but if you like horror action, I think this is a serviceable time waster."

The thing that's kept me coming back to these movies has been their ability to get crazier with each successive entry and this is easily the most insane so far. A new hyper-stylish approach has been taken to the visuals. The smoky streets with their ethereal glow and flashy block parties make it feel like a haunted house. The mask design is more creative and memorable than ever. As weird as it is to see what is chronologically the opening chapter adding sci-fi elements to the mix, those glowing-eyed contact lenses are a nice touch. It relishes in capturing the B-movie shlock with grindhouse-esque camera angles.The politics of the series have always been questionable. Doing more to promote racism with it's highly segregated casting than not. This prequel might easily be the worst offender. No longer hiding behind the thin veneer of satire established by DeMonaco with the previous three films, McMurray is flat-out unsubtle with the symbolism that feels less timely, and more like fearmongering. The message is at odds with the actual content so even if it were the right time, this would never be the right movie.It's hard to care about any of the characters as they're all a bunch of bland stereotypes. This is also the second dumbest Purge just after the original. The premise is that government is trying this event for the first time as an experiment and offering compensation to people if they'll stay on the island while it's happening with the promise of more money should they choose to participate further (i.e. actually commit crimes such as murder). When the time finally arrives they're surprised to find that no one is really doing anything. Gee, maybe it's because you guaranteed them a life-changing sum of money for just sucking air the night of the Purge. Given that all of this was the brainchild of a supposed social psychologist, you think they would have known going into it that when people realize they'll get paid for doing the bare minimum, that's all most of them are going to do. Especially in a situation where doing more would compromise their morals. That's like psychology 101.Anyone will tell you though that the appeal of this series has never been it's story or characters, but the carnage. So it's a good thing this is one gloriously euphoric bloodbath. Y'lan Noel goes all Rambo in a low-rent apartment complex and a lot of throats are slit. With funny one-liners and tons of bloody action you can come into this expecting the usual entertaining madness. Just know that the subtext is more tone-deaf than ever."

      "text": "A prequel that does little to explain much of anything and only gives the bare minimum of content before once again being reduced into a plain action film. The characters are arguably the weakest in the franchise in this one and it tries a bit too hard to play into current social issues without actually making a statement about them.It is not a good sign that these films are getting progressively worst and worst."

It kind of also tries to make social commentary about situation in Usa, but in general yeah, nothing impressive, but if you like other Purge movies, you will like this one too. If you don't, then nothing new to expect here"

      "text": "A franchise that succumbs without a taste of its own medicine: purgation.  With all the odds in its favor, Blumhouse has released its would-be summer hit in the form of a prequel of James DeMonaco's successful utopia \u2014 at least in box-office terms, \u2014 aiming at big dividends, mainly, in American cinemas. If this is true, then it'd surely mean the elongation of this overwhelmingly worn premise for a couple of more years on the big screen, not counting USA Network's TV series. \"The First Purge,\" an origin film about the birth of the controversial law that has grossed almost USD$ 320 million since 2013, is, by far, one of the most generic, tasteless and violent movies of the company since, paradoxically, the highly ambitious second installment of this same franchise starring Carmen Ejogo and Frank Grillo.  \"The First Purge\" is probably the first and unique of the entire franchise that has a really considerable social-commentary dose, still and all its thick-headedness and inefficiency, since if it is compared with its predecessors/successors, Gerard McMurray strives to say something\u2014 via bestial, outrageous scenes that find a solution in controversial violence \u2014about caustic inequality, race snobbery, political manipulation and bigotry, all clumsily enclosed in a political bubble that, strangely, never bursts. DeMonaco taking a back seat in favor of a \"new\" voice brings on drastic changes into the narrative and visual field; a moderately healthy decision. Although he doesn't enrich the mythos, neither fortifies its origins, he delivers a balanced approach in content but unbalanced in quality. On this occasion, the film doesn't know what it is, a \"Get-Out\"-ish social freak out or an unsurprising survival thriller, a dilemma drowned, as usual, by a range of ear-shattering stings. The characters, far from throwing away modern action film stereotypes, are easy preys to meaningless, cat's paws running around and butchering to preserve their lives. Fortunately, unlike the thousands of mindless horror offerings out there, here the relationships between the characters involve a sense of humanity, which automatically causes that, at some point in the film, we worry about the fate of these fictitious individuals.  Peculiarly, antagonistic weight doesn't fall on a fixed actor, rather strongly belongs to wicked government intervention distorting the already nefarious experiment. This is one of its few strong suits, however, much like characters, the shallowness of this \"villain\" doesn't even try to fight audience's predictions, falling into \"race against the clock\" field over and over again, a lost race.Y'lan Noel plays the tritely cold-blooded gangster/action hero in a good way, with a strange charm that ends up echoing among the audience. Unfortunately, Dimitri, his character, is portrayed as a violent, vengeful man, two adjectives that clash with the notion of savior in this kind of film. Lex Scott Davis is who delivers the best performance, even if her character is nothing but another indomitable girl; alright, she gets a special plotting push, but, in the end, is one more final girl saved by a super-man. Mugga, the usual Afro-American comedy-horror comic-relief, does quite well her work, is a positive addition to the melodrama that bathes part of the story. I'm absolutely confident that this film will be remembered for two huge disasters: one, R.I.P. promising premise; two, an unfairly wasted Marisa Tomei. They've muted Tomei's character and that's an unforgivable mistake. In the first two acts, the creative mind behind this \"social catharsis\" doesn't say more than six lines \u2014 the first one, in front of an egregious green screen \u2014and as soon as the third act kicks off, a certain \"twist\" takes place and destroys everything. Marvel's new Aunt May could have been a dream villain, clearly, with a worthy-of-respect design and treatment; alas, it was the greatest sin of a ramshackle tragedy. \"The First Purge\" by Gerard McMurray is just another run-of-the-mill thriller; a rushed B-movie throwback that doesn't even set up DeMonaco's gloomy, eye-catching visual spectacle. But, at the very least, it does achieve to deliver an obtuse edge of complexity to a premise that was on its last legs, burying a meaty context that hardly will resurface, at least, with brand-new stuff. After an insufferably lengthy period of almost seven hours \u2014 the four films' runtime belonging to this franchise, \u2014 something has happened: the experiment has expired. Mixing together DeMonaco's ever-aggressive pulp imagery and McMurray's improvement of some storytelling purposes, a perversely violent-yet-juicy cinematic cocktail may have come out from all this madness, unfortunately, said utopia will never be a reality; the experiment is over."
