      "text": "The twist to \"The Package\" is pretty interesting once you find out what it is.I found it  pretty good, considering it`s a low budget movie. Stone Cold should be in more movies. Also nice to see Dolph Lundgren in something besides the Expendables,  I love how he deals with his enemies in this one. The movie has some nice action. I`m glad I chose to watch it."
