      "text": "\u201cThe Girl on the Train\u201d is the film version of the best selling novel by Paula Hawkins. Directed by Tate Taylor with a screenplay by Erin  Cressida  Wilson, the movie stars Emily Blunt, Justin Theroux and Haley Bennett. Not having read the book it\u2019s difficult to compare the two vehicles but, standing alone, the film is a series of complicated flashbacks, convoluted scenarios and difficult to follow story lines so that it is more of a struggle watching it than a pleasant experience sitting through it. With all that being said, I did, nevertheless, find myself engrossed in the film and perhaps, even more so, because I was trying to follow what was happening and how it would all ultimately end. Ms. Blunt is an amazing actor and exemplifies extraordinary talent as she dominates and appears in almost every scene and is indeed one of the main reasons I give the film an ;8  for, despite all of its shortcomings, it\u2019s a \u201ctrain ride\u201d the viewer will want to take to the end of the spoken \"line\"."
