To whomever was responsible for the majority of the decisions made in this film: please do more films, your work is wonderful.This enjoyable watch was money well spent with my loved ones and kept us entertained the whole time."

Reynolds carries the film a bulk of the way and while the cast is certainly talented, The characters are so insufferable that it is hard to root for anyone because they're so freaking obnoxious.Within the first 20 minutes of the film, What little charm it had died when you realize that it revolves solely on Reynolds giving a rather typical performance playing a character that he seems to enjoy being typecast in. It just sucks."

      "text": "Recently, creative teams apparently have found it irresistible to explore what it means to be human by writing scripts that insert people into video games.  Spielberg\u2019s \u201cReady Player One\u201d (2018) and the Matthew McConaughey vehicle \u201cSerenity\u201d (2019) are recent examples of this emerging genre.  So \u201cFree Guy\u201d has some interesting predecessors.In this film, Ryan Reynolds\u2019 Guy (see what they did there?!) discovers that he is an NPC, a non-player character in a video game.  He\u2019s a totally disposable automated character uninhabited by a person from the real world, mere window dressing when players enter the game to rob banks, shoot people and engage in an endless variety of senseless, violent mayhem.  But Guy also houses an advanced form of artificial intelligence.  When he meets Millie/Molotov Girl (\u201cKilling Eve\u201d star Jodie Comer), he is immediately infatuated and experiences, wait for it, feelings he\u2019s never had before.  Tragically wholesome rom-com moments ensue.In less capable hands, this story line could have sunk the audience into a sugar-induced coma or devolved into a mind-numbing Ted Talk about \u201cbig ideas.\u201d  Fortunately, Director Shawn Levy (\u201cNight at the Museum\u201d series, \u201cCheaper by the Dozen,\u201d  \u201cFamily Trap\u201d) and his screenwriters are too skillful to let that happen.  While addressing important concepts like freedom vs. determinism (sorry, we are now legally compelled to say \u201cpersonal agency\u201d), the nature of love and the value of friendship, he centers this story on more accessible themes like kindness and generosity.  The offhanded violence committed incessantly against the NPCs is a conversation for another day.  (\u201cWestworld\u201d anyone?)The cast here is first-rate.  Ryan Reynolds is at his charismatic, self-effacing best because he doesn\u2019t have to rely on superhero costumes crafted by Rubbermaid or gratuitous f-bombs (that\u2019s right, \u201cDeadpool\u201d).  Jodie Comer is in excellent form, having apparently perfected a unique combination of wide-eyed wonder and world weariness.  Taika Waititi reprises the role of manic, bumbling villain he perfected in \u201cJojo Rabbit.\u201d  The film is crammed with cameos by gamers and streamers (Pokimane, LazerBeam, et al).  There\u2019s a welcome Channing Tatum sighting.  There\u2019s even a brief scene with Alex Trebek and contestants on \u201cJeopardy.\u201d  There are off-screen voiceovers by Dwayne Johnson, Tina Fey, Hugh Jackman and John Krasinski.  But it\u2019s the strength of Reynolds and Comer and the chemistry they build that keep this project from sinking into mediocrity.Other elements that make this film worthwhile are its brief vignettes and priceless one-liners.  One such interchange occurs when Bombshell (Camille Kostek, 2019 SI Swimsuit cover model, real-life girlfriend of football player Rob Gronkowski) enters a bank on the arm of one of the robbers.  After Guy dispatches the robbers, he suggests that Bombshell should be free to make her own life choices.  Bombshell responds that she may not need a man at all.  If only life imitated \u2026 A few of the funniest lines:  Describing his coffee, Guy says, \u201cIt\u2019s like my tongue had a baby with a sunrise.\u201d  Later, \u201cOoh, cappuccino.  I enjoy saying that.  It\u2019s like a waterfall with letters.\u201d  After his first kiss with Millie: \u201cI may not be real, but for a second there, I felt pretty alive.\u201dWhile \u201cFree Guy\u201d is unlikely to make us forget \u201cCitizen Kane\u201d any time soon, it\u2019s better than the standard summer fare, especially in this year\u2019s movie wasteland littered with an overabundance of superheroes and cartoon characters.  This film is breezy, funny and occasionally thought-provoking.  But most of all, in an increasingly unkind world, it\u2019s a pleasant reminder that thoughtfulness, decency and kindness are their own forms of universal truth.  If you can imagine a mash-up of \u201cTed Lasso\u201d and \u201cGrand Theft Auto,\u201d you have a sense of what this film delivers in full."

A fun lightweight movie, similar to Pixels, the Adam Sandler movie that got panned but I thought was pretty entertaining. You do have to put your brain away and try not to think about the logic of it. There weren't a lot of big laughs for me, but it ended strong with \"Dude.\" There were also some \"woke\" lines that were cringy, basically to the effect of \"men are all trash\" (it's funny how it's always men who write stuff like that into movies. I guess they're trying to impress their wives/mistresses.) Also a \"white privilege\" line that was just awful. One of those Hollywood apologetic lines; rather than give the brown character more to do, they just \"acknowledge white privilege\" and then continue to give the white characters the best parts. Typical all-words-no-action Hollywood liberals."

A lot of the stuff they portray as \"in-game\" is entertaining, but the parts in the \"real world,\" which take up way too much of the movie, are even more far-fetched that the \"in-game\" parts.It doesn't help that the movie gets political (\"guns are bad, mmm'kay?\" along with a couple other topics) but it'd be easier to breeze past that if the whole thing wasn't so committed to pretending it was plausible."

This...kind of did, but maybe not as Disney intended.I was a little skeptical of the movie's interactions with Youtubers in particular, wondering how much of an influence they'd actually make in the film. This film I think is fantastic for the audience of gamers, showcasing the importance of human interaction, and how games nowadays have gotten far better at embracing that part of gaming culture.It was still an entertaining film beyond this nailing of audience, however.

With the help of a human player he happens to fall in love with (Jodie Comer), him and the rest of the NPC characters try to rebel against the online world they've been limited to, and must try and stop a greedy gaming CEO (Taika Waititi) from deactivating and shutting them down for good. The trailers for this film gave off major 'Saints Row' vibes to me, along with other similar online shooters, but I found myself intrigued nonetheless. And I can say that after going in with only modest expectations, this film turned out to be an absolute riot, both literally and figuratively, and I mean in a very good way! I had so much fun watching this film and getting immersed within this world and all the bonkers action and antics it had to offer! There's some surprising and welcome cameos throughout, and like any video game-themed, of course there was bound to be some Easter eggs and references to other games and pop culture references here and there, but thankfully the film surprisingly isn't overly saturated with them, unlike with another particular video game-themed film (Ready Player One). In addition, Reynolds is just as funny and entertaining as ever, bringing in that same chipper attitude that he brings to Deadpool all the time. Jodie Comer also holds her own quite well alongside him, although I wasn't exactly comfortable with the 17-yr age gap between her and Reynolds"
