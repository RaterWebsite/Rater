I was anticipating it until I really watched this and lo and behold....we then know why this film was dumped on the streaming service. Let's face it., all of these movie stars coveted a franchise picture like Mission Impossible and the Fast Series. Wahlberg seems to expect this to be his...and recruited the very dependable Fuqua to helm it. Both talented personnel seemed to be a miss for this project. Fuqua is a brilliant action director, but he is more of the gritty type. This sort of high octane, 'Superhero' type of action is not his forte.  Set pieces were brilliantly staged but looked CGI-ed to death. Mark Wahlberg? Between his deadpan delivery and 'Boston tough guy' persona, he felt utterly unconvincing as this character. Many have undermined Keanu Reeve's ability to fit into these projects with ease, but he somehow elevated films such as the Matrix into these iconic pictures. In short, Infinite....another mixed bag blockbuster released during this pandemic year...dumped unceremoniously on a streaming service. If you are looking for a better iteration of this, watch the Old Guard on Netflix instead."

He's tired of being reincarnated because he gets his memories as an infant while everyone gets theirs as adults, and therefore wants to end the world? Wow. That's where the movie lost me."

How is it that every time i see him in a movie is like he personally never wants to be there. He always looks like he just want to go home and lift some weights. He always play the same obnoxious, egotistical selfish characters.Oh the Characters. They are little to be interested in, and there is plot holes plenty.For instance: The bad guy Bathurst. He is dead set to annihilate all life on earth so he does not have to be reincarnated anymore. He is tired and want it to end.. He want to destroy all life on earth once for all.Yet the guy carries a gun called the Dethroner that can trap a soul in a memory card if he shoots another reincarnated in the head, thus ending the cycle.See the thing here? WHY doesn't he use the Dethroner and blow his own brains out and simply end the movie in 5 minutes?This is so dumb and silly beyond measure.Why have the streaming platforms become such a mailbox for bad scripts these days. They cant seem to produce any good movies anymore?"

It will give u a feeling of fast and furious, the old guard and assassin creed movie.But the movie was lacking the details in the sci-fi concept. There were too many plot holes and unanswered questions related to the main concept of science fiction that should be explained and these unanswered questions will leave you empty in the end."

      "text": "One of the best action movies exposing the public to reincarnation.  You can ignore the low scores here and on Metacritic.  This film is NOT chaotic (it had three directors, keep reading).  Rather, this film suffered the same negative reviews any film using valid metaphysical concepts does.This is an actioner in the GI Joe Snake Eyes mold; also, the best of Stephen Sommers best summer popcorn actioners; possibly, also David Leitch's Hobbs and Shaw (better film). The way actioners entertain is based on:- Pacing is more important than character,- Imaginative action stunts help a lot,- The conviction of actors and director to the material is crucial.This movie has lots of in-camera and CGI effects.  This means the movie's director can use the two VFX directors working on this film with him as a \"brain trust\" for how to shoot scenes, camera angles and many plot points.  I believe this is happening here.  The visual flair here is way above many of this director's other films, for example, The Equalizer."

      "text": "I can see now why certain movies go direct to streaming, a fate certainly befitting of this sci-fi misfire. While director Antoine Fuqua's reincarnational action-adventure certainly serves up an intriguing metaphysical premise, its execution leaves much to be desired. In an age when many humans have learned how to recall their past lives with remarkable clarity, they have taken opposing views of this capability -- one camp believing it provides an opportunity for mankind to learn life lessons that leave the world a better place with the other seeing reincarnation as an inescapable trap with no hope for nothing better -- a difference of opinion that has led to conflict between the two sides. The exploration of this idea is indeed an interesting one, but, unfortunately, the story through which it is told consists of a string of implausible, overlong and not terribly interesting action sequences, as well as the plodding performance of Mark Wahlberg and the stunningly hammy overacting of Chiwetel Ejiofor. And what's with all the mascara? Makeup is something that's supposed to be invisible, not glaringly obvious or garish, but these characters often look like they're made up for a '70s glam rock performance. It's regrettable that this vehicle underperforms in light of what it has to work with as a starting point, but that's what can happen when the wrong elements are brought together. And why movies like this end up premiering on the internet instead of in theaters."

      "text": "Infinite is a typical fantasy film featuring Mark Wahlberg. In general, the whole story with the reincorption of bodies and the struggle of two opposing factions is not surprising. The main plot of the film is secondary, it does not stand out and for the most part keeps the viewer with only a few well-staged action scenes. The cast also does not stand out, except perhaps Mark Wahlberg. Infinite is a classic B-movie. Film for one evening, for one viewing. A highly predictable ending. If Infinite had more information about factions, the film would be much more interesting about their history and confrontation with each other. And so it turns out that the viewer is not explained at all as if this is not a film but a fan movie for a narrow circle of viewers."

Mark Wahlberg is, like always, playing himself, and with a spattering of likeable side characters, there's definitely nothing to hate here, just nothing you haven't seen before."

      "text": "Shoutout to my homeboy for hooking me up with the paramount plus, a real one!As for Infinite boy oh boy is it not what I expected, keep in mind I did not see a single trailer for this one, so I went in blind only knowing it was Marky Mark and Antoine Fuqua who made the really great Equalizer flicks ( hopefully it gets a 3rd) so I was pumped and did it deliver ? yes and no. In a way this is my kind of popcorn flick that\u2019s pretty bad but still fun. Premise wise SUPERB, execution not so much ,like the Old Guard that came out on Netflix last year it deals with immortality and having many lives and for a brief few seconds you think you\u2019re going to see said lives play out but you don\u2019t and it\u2019s a shame ,it would have been cool to see what Mark\u2019s character goes through throughout the different Eras of time.It\u2019s biggest crime is slowing down for a bit too long focusing on the whole world building and lore and this goes on for most of the film which was disappointing. Once the action rolls back into gear you might have lost the interest of some viewers.Mark Wahlberg despite being a figure of controversy I like him as an actor and the majority of the films he\u2019s done I come out enjoying so seeing him in the forefront helps but man what a waste of Dylan O Brien who does fantastic work with the few minutes of screen time he gets. I hope in the future he gets more work cuz the dude is awesome. As for Mark himself he once again kicks ass and proves why he\u2019s one of best action dudes of this era. Chiwetel Ejiofor once again does great work and gets to really ham it up as the villain and gets a cool tony stark like moment in the finale that was wicked fun. Sophie Cookson shines as a Sarah Connor like character( if you\u2019ve seen Terminator Genisys you know what I mean, her entrance with the car) she\u2019s badass and sells every fight scene she\u2019s in.Despite some really great action set pieces ( one including a plane and a katana blade) its biggest crime was making it PG-13 if this had been given an R it could have gone way more brutal with the kills. Mark\u2019s character helms this badass katana and doesn\u2019t even use it for his fight scenes until the finale which is a bummer. Quick cuts & fast camera movements really ruin the good fights as they start to gain momentum . Thankfully every now and then the camera is allowed to breathe, and we see some cool stunts. Shocking to think this was the same dude who had my boy Denzel go Rambo in Home Depot a few years prior because that energy is missing bigtime. Music wise pretty bland I didn\u2019t really take away anything from it. I can see now why paramount decided to dump this on the service as cinematic as it feels at times especially with the VFX it does feel like a Netflix wannabe. Overall still a good time if you shut your brain off and don\u2019t think too much of its flaws.If they decide to continue this as series I\u2019m down given the way they leave it off is very exciting reminds me of Snake Eyes coming out later this year."
