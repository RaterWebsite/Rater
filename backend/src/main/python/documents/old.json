On the plus side, I thought they had some creative ideas with having to do with the affect of time on the characters. Completely average film, I'll watch it once but never revisit it."

Altogether, it feels like a first draft error among all aspects that bring a film to life.The acting\u2019s atrocious, the writing\u2019s god-awful, the setting and beating sun wear out its welcome all too fast, and not one single event seems to unfold in a natural or convincing way.I felt a sense of relief that the end runtime was getting closer with each character\u2019s passing."

Many things worked against the movie, especially the acting. None of the actors gave a performance that you would remember. Acting was neither average nor bad, it was worst. I am expecting Worst Actor and Worst Actress nominations and maybe winners from this movie.The concept was different but the reason behind the concept was too much simple. If the writer is making a story then he should have a strong reason supporting the story but like other stories, Shyamalan did bad work here. Shyamalan's stories are always different and unique but the problem comes with the reason he gives at the end of the story. Overall, this movie is just a mare timepass and you may get bored after half way through. But you can watch give it a try for it's different concept."

The character deaths are so random and sudden so when they die you just say WTF XD. This movie should have been a bit longer and should have developed their characters to have a personality so you are shocked and care when they die. They also should have stayed at the resort for longer for world building. Also this movie is SOOO PERDICTABLE. You know the bad guy from the start. Bad Movie But Fun To Watch"

A big one that enjoys to troll his audience, and many inevitably still fall into his game.I've long been tired of his style. That desperate search for a narrative twist that is on a par with what he achieved in The Sixth Sense.He's been looking for that ever since, even if he doesn't admit it.Since then throughout his entire filmography he has tried the same trick, and with the exception of Unbreakable and his two big studio films, in all of them, absolutely all of them, he has failed.Of course, with the considerable difference in quality. Amid the sober tone of The Village, to the miserable film The Happening ended up being, which continues to be the lowest point of his career. Even beyond Lady in the Water.Old is 100% the same. Shyamalan 101.He constructs an intriguing mystery that of course gets the viewer interested. That always happens in all of his films, but soon as they move forward like an hourglass, grain by grain everything deflates.Of course, the metaphor of time being our killer is super clear, and the fear and terror of our own mortality plays a role in it, but that's when the troll comes in and Shaymalan basically tells you: ''Ha HA HA I caught you''It's almost as if he has a compulsion to surprise the audience with a conclusion that it's supposed to be shocking and at the same time has nothing to do with the expectations created by them, and that would be laudable if those conclusions were at least satisfactory, but Old only reinforces that Shyamalan sucks to write endings and more intelligent dialogue."

It\u2019s just a sci-fi mystery that\u2019s only interest is watching how and when the cast will change. On the plus side, the beach is lovely and Shyamalan\u2019s big-screen style keeps it visually attractive. Other than that, this is just a mediocre episode of The Twilight Zone.

There are a ton of cool ideas that are being tossed around here and some of them feel cool and others feel half baked. The cinematography is really great at points but the editing and some shots can be nauseating. The performances all ALL over the place. The mother is awful while Thomasin McKenzie is weird but the schizophrenic Doctor is great. It\u2019s just weird that there is almost no consistency within the performances and writing. The moral implication of some of these ideas are really weird. If a child ages rapidly, do they have the concept of consent. I say this because one of the children that ages gets pregnant from one of the other kids. It\u2019s really really weird at points like that. M. Night is known to have some cool twists, either really great or so bad that it\u2019s funny, but this was fine. It wasn\u2019t earth shattering but it was an interesting idea. Some of the dialogue is laughable bad at points and the film doesn\u2019t always make sense. There is one person on the beach who has been there for a while but he doesn\u2019t age like the other characters and it\u2019s never explained. There is also an issue with how stabbing works in this film but that dives too much into spoilers about the film. This is definitely an entertaining experience and I would recommend watching this if you want a good laugh."

At its worst, the weirdness can tank the film (i.e. \"The Happening\"), but ever since \"The Visit,\" however, the above question has entered into the picture with considerable intensity. Is it something he can just turn on and off or is he really being genuine 100% of the time? I have half a mind to believe it's not even a question anymore with \"Old.\" Even in \"The Happening,\" yeah, the overall feel is off, but the ratio of awkwardness is much more subdued, feeling more like an honest-to-God attempt at something higher than it really is. Here, the wackiness is so off-the-wall and rapid fire that I gotta believe there's been a concerted effort to voluntarily mug at the camera, so to speak. In any event, the result is far from boring, wholeheartedly preposterous and an unmitigated brow-furrower. Please bubblewrap M. Night Shyamalan.

I'll give it one thing, I definitely wasn't bored.A family travel to a tropical island for a holiday and discover that the secluded beach they are relaxing at for a few hours is somehow causing them to age rapidly. Naturally everyone freaks out and tries to find a way off the beach before they literally run out of time. I think I can speak for most people when I say the aging process is a real fear many of us have. No one wants to get old. So to base a movie on the premise of aging rapidly is a scary concept. Well at least I thought so. Based on a graphic novel, M. Night has taken an already scary idea and ramped it up to the max. When Prisca (Vicky Krieps) and Guy (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal) realise their children have aged by years in just a few hours panic ensues. It's ridiculous, cringey and the dialogue seems disjointed and a bit like everyone is just reading their lines. There's also the strange editing and close ups that just start to annoy you after a while. I feel Old has a great idea and it's well executed to a point but the more it drags on the more silly it becomes. It doesn't have the same \"oh **** moments that some other M. Night films have. There are a few laughs scattered throughout, only I'm not sure if you're really meant to be laughing at them. I didn't love Old but I didn't hate it either. It has its moments but overall it's not great. The performances from most of the cast seem bland and wooden. I feel this was close to being top tier Shyamalan but Old ends up being somewhere between The Happening and Split.Shyamalan is one of those film makers who really divides audiences, most of you will either love or hate his movies. Old isn't exactly his best but it's not his worst either. Look you get what you expect, the trailer sets it all up so all you have to do is get yourself into a nice air-conditioned cinema, sit back and enjoy this intense thriller. And if you didn't like it, that's fine, and if you loved it that's also fine. Like I said, Shyamalan's movies can be hit or miss, the only way you're going to find out is if you see it for yourself. Recommended for all the M. Night fans."
