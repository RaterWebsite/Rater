      "text": "In Tony Scott's third straight feature starring Denzel Washington, he takes a look at an incident that occurred 3 years prior in Ohio. The event was nowhere near the magnitude seen in Unstoppable, but it defiantly put lives at risk, and put people to the test. The story follows an incident with a runaway train and the two men who risk everything to save lives from it's dangerous cargo. Washington is terrific as always, thriving in these unsung hero roles. Chris Pine, the virtual newcomer who  plays the rookie, on his first day of work, is also really good and shows the potential for a strong film career. While it's not going to surprise or shock anyone, Unstoppable was fast paced, visually impactful, and very entertaining."

He needs larger parts."

As they come to know about the unstoppable , frank devises a plan through which there are chances of stopping it. What is the plan frank devises ? how they stop the train is the movie about!\rExecution: the two questions are been effectively answered. The movie ran for 92 minutes with perfect execution without any boring scenes. Right from the start till the end , the movie had adrenaline rush. Thanks for the crisp editing for the thrill to keep alive at regular intervals. Direction and screenplay: tony scott had done a commendable job. Though the script is in one line , the movie is definitely a catchy one. Screenplay is very fast without any slowness.\rCasting: densel Washington and chris pine are the main characters of the movie. They have done a good job. An equal support by Rosario dawson and galvin gives the movie equal benefit. Rest characters fit well.\rBackground score: the rustling train sounds right from the start till the stopping of the engine , the train roars. Set in a perfect soundscape , the train 777 will rustle and roar in the cinema halls. A perfect movie for home theatres also. The score is soothing , scintillating and sometimes picks up at right intervals. The sound editing is awesome.  Editing: the editing of the movie is crisp and standard. The movie ran for 90 minutes and it seemed that the runtime was still far better. But due to crisp editing , the movie was perfectly driven with the train on board and 2 people on its way.\rCinematography: the visuals in the movie are good. But cannot say they are awesome. The train moves and the surrounding scenaries of various towns across pensylvennia are captured. Nice view from the helicopters. It looked decent.\rVFX: the visual effects in the movie are not there to that extent. Few crashes and explosions are there. It moves off very quickly. But anyway , the scenes had good visual effects.\rAction episodes : there are 3-4 action episodes and stunt scenes performed by the lead cast. Not in terms of bashing of goons , but in terms of jumping onto the train. They are good enough. Camera zooming is good and the thrill during jumping , is intense.\rProduction values: the movie has a good budget. Nicely taken and it deserves\rEntertainment value: the movie is entertaining. It is a perfect adrenaline rush movie. The viewers are hooked to the seats right from the title and the start of the 777. Till the climax scene everyone are hooked and this is a perfect treat for the weekend night along with the family. Rating: 3.5/5.0\rFinal word: unstoppable is well packed action entertainer. It is a good movie. A sure hit. It deserves 4 stars but , due to lack of startling graphics and interesting cast , the movie stays with 3 \u00c2\u00bd stars."

It was a little slow at the beginning and it took a little while to get going, but once it got going, it was GOING! And throughout this intense action, they added in some comedy that was funny and it worked. This movie deserves your money. If you're seeing skyline, forget about skyline, Unstoppable is where its at! This script is solid! The acting is phenominal! the visuals, dear lord they are awesome. Although a slow, and somewhat long start, this movie is great fun!"

Therefore, it's the stuff that happens in the middle that really matters. And Unstoppable does a good job with that. The characters are all dealing with their personal problems (except for the guy in the pickup truck) and little personality tugs (except, once again, for the guy in the pickup truck). Most of the plot holes were filled except for: why not just keep chasing the train down in a pickup truck instead of a bunch of crazy other options. And of course, I wish it was a sadder story. Probably wouldn't even have picked it up the shelf ifit wasn't. I mean, why would there be a train with toxic chemicals running off and crashing into things!? They explained that nicely with the fat guy that ended up in the fast food industry. And I think the school children should have died. But it was still one of the best movies I've ever seen (and it's competing with The Dark Knight, Inception, Gladiator, Lord of the Rings, Batman Begins, and IRobot (at least one of these names has to mean something to you)). And to criticmike: the train that was \"unstoppable\" was going to fast to sidetrack."

      "text": "The best popcorn thriller of the year - I was on the edge of my seat for the duration.  The direction and pacing is tight, the plot is kept to a minimum, and the cinematography (although exactly the same as all other recent Tony Scott films) keeps the momentum and tension on track.  Much of the credit has to go to Washington and Pine for their easy chemistry and considerable everyman charm (and their bravery in tackling the stunts).  Rosario Dawson too, is perfect and fresh in her role, effectively representing the voice of reason.  All three are likeable despite very little backstory and demand real empathy from the audience.  The only downside is that some minor characters are underwhelming and their reactions at times are insufficient (particularly when their loved ones are in serious peril).  In saying that, simplicity is the key to this films success, and all aspects result in a fun frenetic experience."

It started as can be expected, a train that can't be stopped, wooh, how will it end.  But at some point in the first hour you suddenly realize that the director isn't phoning it in.  Every smart idea you can think of to stop that train, they actually try, and everything fails.  The director does a great job of staying one step ahead of the audience which allows control freaks like me to relax and just follow.  At one point when things started getting particularly heroic, I had an emotional flash back to 9/11 and felt like chanting, \"AMERICA!\"Great job guys, well worth our time and dime."

If you have seen the trailer, you have also met the three characters who play the largest roles--Frank (Denzel Washington), Will (Chris Pine), and Connie (Rosario Dawson). What you do not realize from the trailer is that these characters are fillers, they are superfluous--they are not even credited with having last names! (When was the last time that happened to leading characters in a November release?) The real star of the show is the TENSION, which is simple and doesn't pretend to have any kind of outrageous complexity to it, which also makes it feel much more real.\"Unstoppable\" is succinct, and that is also the real beauty and what people will no doubt dislike about the film. The film quite literally starts off ("

Only a Superintendent or Trainmaster would have that responsibility, especially in an emergency.  A minor sub-plot, that the engineer has been involuntarily retired with \"half benefits\" is blatantly illegal and simply does not happen under modern law.

      "text": "Denzel again! Tony Scott again! And Train again? Tony Scott (Director) must be so curious about thiz Train thing. Just last year, Scott urged Denzel Washington into the train robbery for THE TAKING OF PELHAM 1 2 3, with John Travolta. Now, he brought up a true event in 2001, when unmanned raging train that carrying tons of toxic chemical sliding wildly out of control without air brake and it is totally unstoppable. I have to say, thiz movie is in a very good story-telling. It reminds me of how old-time action movies pump up our adrenaline where the event is occurring only in a few hours long, like in: DIE HARD (1988) or SPEED (1994). Tony Scott who is the brother of Ridley Scott (also Director) always knows how to make a precise recipe of good Action Movies. If you want to search for drama, Ridley is the man. But if you want to experience some good actions, you find Tony, like what he did in TOP GUN (1986) and my favorite TRUE ROMANCE (1993). It starts slow with problematic introduction, and then, as the Train goes faster, the tension goes greater as well. Scott pins down a suitable direction for each of its technical aspects. The sounds are so rich and realistic, you can actually feel the threaten train is chugging and rushing in front of your seat. And the hand -shake camera simply drags you into the center of situation, and forces you to think along how to solve the complication. The camera work and movement is really effective and outstanding. In the same direction, all Casts are in good shape. Everyone can deliver a believable working-class presentation. The costume and make-up support that completely.  It seems to me, it is a piece of cake for Denzel, to merge into thiz kind of movie. And our Star Trek new Capt. Kirk, Chris Pine can eventually bring balance into their interaction. Rosario Dawson also shows significant existence of her supporting role. Maybe the story has been exaggerated and dramatized to make it more interesting. Like it or not, Scott has created one great vessel of effective high-octane action with his own way. Like on the movie, the train company executive once said, It is my train! It is my decision!\r Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com"
