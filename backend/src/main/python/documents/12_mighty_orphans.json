      "text": "A sweet, old school family movie. It was so much fun to hiss @ \"Newman\" every time he did something really bad onscreen. Very well edited. You have to cheer for the underdogs in this movie."

      "rating": "10",
      "text": "Inspirational on all levels for overcoming life circumstances and trauma involving war, loss of parent/s, death of dreams, abuse mental and physical, violence, poverty, lack of opportunity, substance abuse.  The creation of community and the importance of education and character and winning through values and perseverance in the 1930s true story setting \u2014 I am going for a 3rd time and I am not one to watch movies repeatedly."

      "text": "12,000 mighty cliches. Martin Sheen is terrific, Luke Wilson OK, Wayne Knight bad (some of that is the writing and dull direction). I doubt even the Cartoon Network would hire Lane Garrison after his \"performance.\" The kids give the most honest and real performances... especially Jake Austin Walker, his scene in the barn towards the end is powerful and genuine - he steals this movie... but watch it on Lifetime when they play it."

    {
      "rating": "5",
      "text": "I wanted to like it, but it is predictable, sappy, and formulaic. Think Hoosiers but with orphan playing football, then add melodrama and overly processed sentimentality. The last half of the movie seemed better than the first, or it could be that my expectations dropped or I became immune to the nostalgic dialogue. The villains are predictable. The antagonist has an oddly modern haircut. One extra had distractingly white teeth. However, the real life stories in the credits are interesting."

It made me laugh, cry and feel all sorts of emotions that movies used to make u feel !  I\u2019m saying the cast was awesome, the storyline superb, and the production and direction made the \u201cfeelings\u201d come alive!  I loved it!  Kudos to u ALL!  I do hope it goes far !"
