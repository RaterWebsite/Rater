      "text": "I cannot deny this film it's a different proposal, but it's also one that comes to feel ridiculous, excessive and self-indulgent.I give credit to the young protagonist for the amount of dialogue she memorizes, but her performance is incredibly stiff.There's no shred of emotion in her work, and the whole story revolves around her, so the lack of a solid main character is more than problematic.I'm not sure what this film intended to be, whether comical or serious, but neither of these things work for it, and ends up as a somewhat boring and inevitably failed experience.Definitely not for everyone."
