How does this sellout (movie) sell 200k (soundtrack) in the first week? The auto tune is actually distracting enough to the point where you can hear jumps in tone and note if you listen carefully enough. The movie is too bubblegum pop and not enough focus on music."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "HSM3 was i think the best musical for now... It can make every senior feel that it's really gonna be over for them, they're going separate places after graduation... And for me, as a high school student, it had touched me in different ways... The movie made me want to perform because it is so energetic, all the numbers make you have Last Song Syndrome (LSS), and even though I don't really enjoy love scenes, this movie kinda made me like it... If you compare this to other musicals, this would be the leading one, this is the best among musicals as for now."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "High School Musical 3 is a BIG WASTE OF MONEY!

It's a full on, full bore musical that's unashamed of its exuberance, innocence or over-the-top-ness. The musical numbers are terrific, and after a few years of working together, these kids have real chemistry and theyve taken the dancing up several notches. It's easy to dismiss Effron as a disposable pretty boy idol, but he's really got the makings of an honest to goodess musical star. Looking for mindless, guilty pleasure fun - see this in on a big screen and try not to smile or feel uplifted - I dare ya."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Not the worst film I've ever seen, but it comes pretty close.

Amazing..!!! and has the perfect ending that a movie ever done.! the songs r incredible the dance over the top.. and the acting are the best..! but the history is everything..! and Ashley Tisdale was so Fabulous.! HSM3 is the best musical EVER MADE IN HISTORY..! ''Once A Wildcat Always A Wildcat''!!!!"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "I was quietly hesitant or at least expecting a catnap while my kids enjoy the show but I was pleasantly surprised! The topics and emotions touched a nerve for me ( I remember the same concerns and even now wonder of life's direction) the musical numbers were either romantic, over the top with skills and fun. I laughed out loud a few times, got a bit teary eyed and just left the theatre feeling as pepped up as the kids. It was worth the money!"}, {"rating": "3", "text": "The late Miles Davis once said on \"The Arsenio Hall Show\" that he hears music at basketball games. The renowned trumpeter wasn't referring to the Top 40 ilk that pumps out of arena loudspeakers; the legendary musician, whose \"Bitches Brew\" signaled the genesis of fusion, was talking about the squeaks that a shoe produces on the hardwood floor. In \"High School Musical 3: Senior Year\", Troy Bolton(Zac Efron) \"can't stop the music;\" he breaks into song even while the big dog on campus leads his team to victory. Is there a better way to portray a closeted athlete? The basketball court, or the stage: What is Troy's \"Xanadu\"? \"A boy. An honest-to-God straight boy,\" that's how a counselor describes one of the music campers in Todd Graff's \"Camp\"; the boy who auditions with The Rolling Stones' \"Wild Horses\" on his guitar. Needless to say, it turns out that the seemingly straight boy is gay too, just like all the other male Stephen Soundheim worshippers. The position that \"Camp\" undertook, preserves the stereotype about the synonymy of Broadway music and gay men. Because \"High School Musical 3: Senior Year\" bears the Disney insignia, a chaste kiss is the only action that Troy gets out of Gabriella Montez(Vanessa Hudgens), but the absence of physical love doesn't account for the musical number(\"Scream\") where Troy goes on a rampage in the empty school. Just for the record: boys shout, girls scream. When Jonah Hill screams(as in scream like a little girl) after happening upon a corpse in Steve Pink's \"Accepted\", he asks the other guys to keep his feminine flare-up, a secret. Is it just a desire to sing and dance that's eating away at Troy? When he gets off the phone with Gabriella(who's away at an early-acceptance program at Stanford), look closely at how Troy positions himself on the bed in the vicinity of his teammate(when the cat's away, the mice will play). The scenario comes scarily close to what goes down in Todd Solondz's \"Storytelling\" between Scooby(Mark Webber) and his \"special\" friend. \"Falling Slowly\", the achingly gorgeous ballad that Glenn Hansard and Marketa Irglova perform in John Carney's \"Once\", makes you believe that these two strangers are falling in love, because the music is real. The songs aren't show tunes; they're written for real life(for digital video). \"Once\" has the distinction of being the first truly heterosexual musical. The little indie did something interesting to the musical genre. Since the folk-based music did such a superior job of conveying tenderness and devotion than its imitative brethren; the love ballad, steeped in the musical theater tradition, has the effect of compromising the validity of a couples' love, with Troy and Gabriella's performance of \"Can I Have This Dance?\" being just one example, because their sentiments are being transmitted through a musical vein that's largely believed to be appreciated largely by women and gay males."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Dreck. And the people who have sent this film to the top of the charts are also going to vote. That is terrifying."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Shame on Disney for not making any movies for teenagers. Disney needs to know that teenagers are deserved to watch movies about serious, realistic things such as pregnancy, drugs, gangs, etc. Disney needs to stop making any crappy movie like HSM!"}, {"rating": "0", "text": "This movie has as little entertainment as Paris Hilton has talent.

With a move to the big screen came a jump in their budget and boy did they take it and run! Great script, absolutely astounding musical numbers, and an amazing cast make for one of the best musicals in years. The dance numbers are right up their with the greats such as West Side Story, and this is especially evident in the best dance number in the movie, \"The Boys Are Back\". Some songs could have been left out, but overall this music is electrifying. It's as if someone is taking a syringe full of happy and injecting it right into your heart. If you don't like the music, you should like the choreography, if you don't like that, than you probably have a heart two sizes, too small. HSM3 is movie event that should be seen by every one of all ages!"}, {"rating": "1", "text": "I'm a teen, and i found this movie AWFUL! I'm 12, and i can tell you that this is the worst movie of the year. God, why do some many other kids love this movie, i mean the movie is just, well, stupid, there's no plot. And, why did they ever create the F---ing thing! By the way, High school is not revolved around Teens trying out for musicals, how about pregnancy, and um, peer pressure. I don't care if its a tween/teen film, for those who love it, you're messed up and it's not cause' i can't enjoy it because i tried. For those of you who agree with me, If you haven't seen Sweeney Todd, which is one of my favorites of all time, you should, if you hated this crap... Sweeney Todd is so much better than the freakish, little baby, retard-movie High School Musical..... go see sweeney instead. I loved it.

I actually saw the movie and I gravely regretted it. The singing and the music is terrible; there is no plot sypnosis; the romance it nothing but common high school life (I don't even know why kids are calling it \"so romantic\"); the acting was terrible as well; and it completely lacked humor.

The writing is bad? It's High School Musical not Waiting For Godot for goodness sake. It's about singing, dancing and kids having a good time. And that's exactly what my 8 year old daughters had. When the worlds most cynical man (Charlie Brooker) finds it difficult to hate the High School Musical movies you know it's time to leave cynicism and pretension at the door and have some good clean fun. Lighten up world. We've got enough to worry about other than slating a perfectly entertaining family movie with its heart in the right place."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This movie BLEW MY MIND!

This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. I'm not even going to go into detail. Becuase, well, it's too awful, abysmal and a word I can't use. You see, the first two HSMs made me nod my head in shame, dissapointed at what Disney have done. Then a third one came out, and I think Disney has destroyed ALL of my reputation from me. I remember when all that came out of Disney was good stuff. However, nowadays, Disney are still focusing on the younger audiences. ONLY the younger audiences. Come on, Disney! Make a violent movie! We grew up with you!

This film is part of the ruin that is modern disney. Disney's only hope lies in reinventing themselves and hoping that Pixar keeps up the quality and the rest of the company. For a Musical, the music in this and the other 2 films is horrible. In many modern musicals, there is a mix of music but in the HSM series it is just all pop and stuff that appeals to 8 year olds and under. The \"teen\" idea behind the film is horrible because these characters are impossible for any teen to empathise with. I mean how many teens do you know that have rich parents and are the popular kids of the school that always perform in the musicals and somehow manage to insult people while hanging out with their sibling? outside of the world of this kids' trash, there are no actual teens like these characters."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "oh good this is bad not again its not fair its just not fair!!

The movies have been a great success; however, how can tween viewers relate to the characters when they are moving off to college? Discussing about universities half of the time is meaningless to them, which may lose some interest. Furthermore, the rivalry between Gabriella and Sharpay was absent in this movie, which is quite a disappointing. Was expecting for something a bit more special. The songs are great, but it would be better if they were more 'classic' sounding than a modern 'rock' sound. Overall, it is a good movie, so HSM fanatics should check it out."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "The best of them all. With some good songs, okay performances and some touching  moments.

Our main characters are already in their final year and it is a kind of last ride of singing and a kind of common farewell, which takes place most of the time again at school and in the final part it is quite nostalgic and a return to the first part. The songs again I can't say if they were worse or better. Again, don't look for anything of quality in the story, but as I said, I would consider it the best of the trilogy here. On top of that you could see the shift in the cinematography. So, for me, an average film that closes this musical and probably a treat for fans. Not much for the average viewer."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Doesn\u2019t live up to the previous 2, only good parts are the beginning, the \u201ccan I have this dance\u201d song and the end concert.
