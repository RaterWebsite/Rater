Overall it is likely one of the best film released starring the so called \"frat-pack\". For me this is really the movie that sets Will Ferrell up for the future he had (Anchorman and Blades of Glory followed and for Vince Vaughn Dodge ball and Wedding Crashers). There were several times hat I found myself in stitches over this movie. Its just as significant now as it was in 2003, and its aged well over the 12 years since its release. If you are a fan of any of the stars in this film Old School is worth watching because this is really the beginning of the revolution for these actors, except for Luke Wilson who we would certainly like to see back in a film like this again."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Like other Todd Phillips movies, \"Old School\" is as full of characters who display a real arch as much as it is full of laughs.

The film tells the story of Mitch, played by Luke Wilson, whose life basically falls apart before his eyes. He then decides to move in to a house on a college campus. Mitch's friends Frank and Beanie, played by Ferrell and Vaughn, convince him to start a fraternity within the college campus. Hilarity, of course, ensues. I found myself laughing a fair amount in this movie. There were a couple moments that were made me laugh hysterically, but overall the laughs came pretty moderately for me. Luke Wilson is great at playing. . .well the straight man - I feel that that's all he plays in movies unfortunately. And Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn are excellent as Wilson's flawed but fun friends. Overall I found the movie pretty darn hilarious.

And yet I liked it. It is smarter than it pretends to be.Old SchoolTodd Phillips, the co-writer and director, is one of those filmmakers that gets comedy right. We see people take comedy lightly and as a result the comedy starts taking them for granted. As in, even good sketch scenes and one liners have failed repetitively if there is no head or leg to its existence. Over the years, you see these happening.. nay, escalating where you see a series of jokes stitched together in the form of highlight. This post social media world where patience is the last thing on the audience's list.They are usually gobbling over these attention seeking humor. Where the root and stem is chosen, overpowered by the fruit. But what it, if looked at the bigger picture, shows is that there is no need to endure either the hard work by the audience or put up by the makers. And hence comes these few filmmakers who believes in the entire characters. All sides of it. All dimensions.Phillips makes sure you see each side of them before you experience the wildness, the mistakes and their surprising skills. In fact, even his jokes work like that. It starts with an innocent or childish or amateur ideas then leads up to its peak and then we are also shown what the aftermath result is. These layers may get unnoticed if you are mesmerised in Will Ferrell's commitment to physical comedy. Old School is old if looked at the ideas it explores. It sounds like an idea that is pitched to the producers to get them all riled up over the script.
