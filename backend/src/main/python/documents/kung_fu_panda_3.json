It is the third movie in a franchise about a Panda who learns Kung Fu. In fact, the very idea that this film series would reach a third entry would be an unbelievable feat. But a funny thing happens in the movie and the series, and major props need to be given to lead character Jack Black. I don't think this series succeeds without him. He brings a heart yet goofiness that you can't help but feel as the movie progresses. And just like this series, which I didn't think would work, this film proves me wrong.\r Now that isn't to say that Black is the only reason this series works. The story is fresh in a world filled with reboots and overdone cliche stories. This film is a classic homage to the hallmark Kung Fu films of the 70s, where good triumphs over evil and the main character, never wavering and true to himself, comes out on top. And Po does just that. When an ancient villain comes back from the spirit realm, Po finds himself targeted in Kai's quest for ultimate power. During all of this, Po's birth father shows up to find and reconnect with his son, as well as take him to his hometown so he can meet all of the other Pandas. This arrival of the birth father leads to a confrontation with his adopted dad, who feels worry that he will lose his son to his birth father.\r This storyline hits a chord with me. I think a lot of us nowadays are either children of divorce or know someone who is. The idea of having a new extended family because of a stepfather or adopted father isn't a foreign one to children. Yet we don't get a lot of stories touching on that, or if they do it's sometimes horror stories about mean step families. This is a tale that teaches acceptance and the good things that can come from having a larger than usual extended family. A scene towards the end of both fathers holding out hope for Po and working together sends the message home that you can have more than the \"traditional\" family and gain something from it.\r If I had to find a negative for the movie, it would be the size of the cast list. The cast is good and they all do a good job, but it feels like there is too much going on at times for all of these characters and they become wasted in the story. I wish they would have simply had a few sit this one out instead of setting the table for all of them and then pushing so many to the fringes.\r The animation and story are crisp, and the voice acting is good and over the top without feeling fake. I don't know if the actors had much interaction with each other but it certainly felt as though they had a chemistry and didn't just record lines in a booth one rainy day and then move on, never to consider that job again. JK Simmons and Bryan Cranston were great, if not under noticed as usual. Jack Black was perfect for the character as previously mentioned, and the movie never lingers too long or wastes a moment. This movie is the perfect Sunday movie where you can take the family, laugh, learn something, and leave feeling good about yourself. I cannot wait to see what the filmmakers come up with next in this series, and hope it can maintain this level of storytelling and casting."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I thought this movie was going to be a lousy sequel money grab but I was going to take my son anyway.

So if you are an animation fan, especially 'Kung Fu Panda' and Po's fan, brace yourself for the future treats. This film was amazing. After two wonderful adventures, now this story has calmed down a bit with simplicity. Visually, it was spectacular with all those fight sequences, but the story was quite dramatised with enough comedies and then the final battle to conclude the 3rd installment on a high note.\r I think it was a well designed storyline in advance keeping in mind 5 to 6 films, that's why the flow was very smooth between all the three with those flashbacks placed at the right place. This particular part belongs to Pandas, the furious five were absent in most of the film, but good to see the return of Oogway. The master Oogway comes at the beginning and then during the end, though very happy for presence as he's my favourite character in this franchise. He's not a big player, but like Yoda, he's amazing and tell me who won't like him.\r This time no Skadoosh, but a new villain with a battle fought for a new powerful thing called Chi. Now Po got a promotion, so I'm very excited for the next film for how it will going to turn out. This is a beautiful family film and must not miss it. All the cast was returned from the previous two and a few more new were recruited and it is set in a new location for the most of the narration like the most of the animations has done in China. After all made in China is not so bad.\r 8/10"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Good conclusion to previous series.

But still, I think the villain could be better - the threat of that peacock guy and his army from the 2nd felt much more real, plus he was disclosured much better as a character, in my opinion.\rBut generally, Kung Fu Panda 3 is gonna bring a lotta joy to the fans of the series :)"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Both kids and adults will love this, because Kung Fu Panda 3 is an amazing movie.

It\u2019s well worth a watch especially if you have kids, and judging from my screening the adults will also get something out of it.  I would say, if you enjoy martial arts films, see all three and don\u2019t be put of by all three of these films horrible advertising campaigns which don\u2019t show off what the quality of the films are at all.  It\u2019s probably worth picking up all the supplementary spin off material as well, including all of the secrets trilogy and the holiday special.\r Is Kung Fu Panda 3 as good as it\u2019s previous two movies, not quite, but by no means is it a disappointment."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Our beloved and adorable Po is most welcomed to return in this ridiculous, playful yet beautiful third installment. The entire animation has exactly the same formulaic plot as the previous two episodes - a villain comes out of no where, the journey in preparing to fight and at the end only the main character can take down the big bad fella; adding on a whole bunch of cheesy moments but it is hilarious and entertaining thanks to Jack Black's well commitment. The Kung Fu adventure is absolutely beautiful and impressive, thanks to the stunning visual effects which heavily covers the Chinese cultures, settings and backgrounds; also the scores by Hans Zimmer who perfectly composes by mixing every single Western tracks with Chinese musical instruments. This family-friendly adventure might be fun without any great moral values as in Disney and Pixar animations but the reunion of this chubby panda with his biological father and the conflict with the adapted parent does generate some important messages that is worth to learn."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "this was a total blast my entire family enjoyed it filled with fun and huge laughs from the start i would take my family to see this agin any day any time they asked me too proves u can still make a good clean comedy that will entertain the entire family go see it u wont be sorry u did trust me lovely movie"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "It doesn't have the emotional impact the first two movies had and it treads very familiar ground, but Kung Fu Panda 3 is a lot of fun with beautiful animation, great characters, exciting action, and a lot of enjoyment overall."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Even as a fan of this franchise i was very surprised with this movie especially because of its date release.

I have fixed me that animation films of \"Kung Fu Panda\" is not fully detailed in their funds, but a blue sky sea water or a simply pink sunset is most magical and deeper than a location details (\"Zootopia\"), this buoyant and sophisticated effect can be seen in the opening bout.\r This small and perhaps unenforceable detail is one of the great pleasures of Jack Black's films. Of the few successful projects of \"Dreamworks Animation\" \"Kung Fu Panda\", \"Shrek\" and \"Madagascar\" have been the face of the Studio, although these two latest already they have no chance, the bear panda still has more to give.

Po finds his lost father and embark on an expedition to a habitat full of mammals. There he will have to learn and teach his family martial arts to eventually fight with the furious animal.\r Directors Alessandro Carloni (DreamWorks Animation) and Jennifer Yuh (2 \"KFP\") create a fun and interesting story where the legacy made previously is not sacrificed, instead they emphasize more the possibilities that has the franchise for a fourth part. The history of parents is loaded with funny jokes, but its main function is to generate the dramatic counterpart in the film. Therefore the central story is well established and the moments of action and adventure are excellently executed, illustrated as a masterpiece of animation.\r \"Kung Fu Panda 3\" is clearly just fun. Perhaps it feel as a part that was unnecessary to do, since this franchise not weaves the story of its characters as Disney's sagas, Dreamworks recreates different stories in his films, a double-edged weapon. \"KFP 3\" has not the load dramatic that had \"Toy Story 3\"or \"Monsters, Inc\" but its brightness and comicality both visual and auditory create a nice film and that truly breaks expectations."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "it is the best movie in the kung fu panda franchise. it had it's jokes.but the highlight is were po basically turns into a freeeeeking deity.

If you compare the fight scenes from Kung Fu Panda and Kung Fu Panda 2 to this movie, there is less humor and more drama. Po is in a state of bewilderment (I won't say what for) for most of the film. The movie does tie sections of Kung Fu Panda and Kung Fu Panda 2 together, but does so abruptly rather than cleanly. The villain character's personality and backstory is less sophisticated than the one in Kung Fu Panda and Kung Fu Panda 2 and their dialog doesn't tie in with Po's humor as well.

If you've seen the the last two movies on this franchise, you pretty much know what you're getting into, very well animated action set pieces, character moments and a prophecy.\rIn this movie, Po, the legendary dragon warrior, reunites with his long lost biological father. When a new threat arises from the spiritual realms, he then has two challenges in front of him, one supernatural and another very different, but much closer to his heart.\rJust like the last two, I really liked this movie from start to finish. The animation is glorious but what makes these movies as good as they are, is the character moments that make us feel for them. When they're fighting, you get thrilled at the amazing sequences filled with epic moments and great fighters, when they're not fighting, you're usually either laughing a lot, or feeling a lot. It knows when to be funny and when to get serious, and this is very important in such a movie. Sure, all three Kung Fu Panda movies are pretty similar in themes and emotion, but they're all great and build upon one another nonetheless.\rThe villain Kai, voiced by the great J. K. Simmons, is truly a threat to the world of Kung Fu. He makes his presence known by doing great fights, and doing damage that no previous villain could do. Even though personally I like the second movie the most, and the villain Lord Shen (voiced by Gary Oldman) is still overall the best in my opinion, Kai is also very memorable and a strong villain in general. The score, composed by Hans Zimmer is unforgettable and really good, especially the Kai theme that helps him be even more mesmerizing and threatening.\rI loved this movie, not as much as the second one, but on par with the first one.

To be honest, some of the plot points used in this movie are quite lazy, to the point that it became predictable. Fortunately, the movie doesn't spend a lot of time focusing on those particular plot points. Some of the humor is pretty funny, but I felt as if this movie was trying to throw everything but the kitchen sink at the audience to milk every laugh they can get.

Needless to say that because the previous two set the bar so high, it was a little disappointing.\r However, by its own merit, this movie is still worth watching. The traditional Kung Fu Panda movie has excellent animation, a well composed soundtrack, and an excellent cast; and this movie is no exception.

The best aspect of Panda 3 is the animation. It's beautifully animated with great detail, fluid motion, colorful backgrounds, and has very well choreographed fight scenes. The 2D animated backstory was a nice touch as well. The story is a nice conclusion to what started in the second film as it perfectly balances the comedy and drama out. The world is expanded into new places that keeps everything fresh and new. However, there are a few issues. Considering that Po meets his real dad for the first time and now has two dads; this is handled in the safest way possible with little conflict. Since there are so many new characters; this means old ones like The Furious Five have little screen time. In addition, many of the new characters like Po's dad, Mei Mei, and the villain Kai are rather bland.

It should be noted that while it\u2019s subjective, my opinion is that Kung Fu Panda 3 is ever so slightly the weakest of the franchise, but that\u2019s not a knock on the film. Kung Fu Panda 3 is often funny, beautifully animated, and features great characters. This is another great animated film for the entire family, that will surely delight people of all ages.\rThe tone of Kung Fu Panda 3 is a somewhat silly one, much like the other Kung Fu Panda films, however it does a good job of balancing mature themes with silly humor. The film also does a good job of balancing both subtle and witty humor with more bombastic and silly humor. The humor is bolstered by the terrific voice acting of the entire cast, which is as per usual great. Many times throughout this film I found myself laughing hysterically.\rAnother impressive element of the film is the amazing animation in this film. It may seem like every animated film features beautiful animation, but the animation in this film is truly amazing. Another impressive element of the animation is the action, which in an animated film may not seem like something to watch for, but the action sequences in Kung Fu Panda 3 are amazing. Many times watching this film the animation is so good it looks real, which is in it\u2019s own right an amazing accomplishment.\rThe film\u2019s pacing is great, but what\u2019s even better is the character development. With a story that isn\u2019t the strongest, the characters keep the film entertaining. Besides the villain, a character who feels like a forced conflict thrown in just to give the film drama, all of the characters in this film have some kind of development. Many of the characters are relatable, which helps the audience care about them. With characters that the audience can relate to and root for, the consequences of the film feel even heavier.\rIn Conclusion Kung Fu Panda 3 is a great fun film for the entire film with a little bit of something for everyone. The film is gorgeously animated, features well developed characters, great action sequences, good voice acting, and a terrific sense of humor. Despite the weak villain, occasionally silly tone, and some cliches the film is still very enjoyable. If you have some young kids take them to this film you\u2019ll all enjoy it."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I don't give out 10s willy nilly. This film is simply incredible.

Kung Fu Panda is not on it's way to being the kind of film trilogy you see a handful of times in a generation, it's already there."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "The Kung Fu Panda film franchise is great overall, but with this one I felt they (producers/writers) were more preachy than before. Let's first examine the secret panda village, which was lazily modeled after the Shangri-La from James Hilton's \"Lost Horizon\". Not much diversity there, only pandas, but it was paradise so that's a cultural message of homogeneity being more advantageous - and that's, um, un-American. And then there's the bio-father and adoptive/step-father awkwardness which resolves with their teaming - so there's another preachy moment about how multiple parents should partner rather than compete. And then in the end, Po doesn't prevail due to his own inner strength but the strength derived from the combined spiritual (ugh) efforts of his family and friends. I didn't see a producer credit listed for Hillary Clinton but jeez, how \"It Takes a Village\" obvious can you get?!  And finally, Po does the Neo into Agent Smith possession thing from \"The Matrix Revolutions\" - no messaging there, just another example of cinematic plagiarism. I think we all would prefer more entertainment and less \"cultural messaging\" (and plagiarism) from the cretins in Hollywood."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Kinda dumb and entertaining in fits and spurts, here and there, but none of the coherent story and satisfying plot of the original movie. Tries very hard to strike a sentimental, warm and fuzzy feel, but it comes off too much like a disjointed in-school cartoon to teach first graders self esteem by being themselves. Like a stereotypical Chinese meal, leaves you hungry for more substance and not very filling."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "When they told you Citizen Kane was the Citizen Kane of cinema they didn't know that Kung Fu Panda 3 was on its way to theaters THIS JANUARY. This movie is"}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Just mediocre.\rIt was a mediocre plot, mediocre fights, mediocre characters, although animated quite well, it was basically the installment nobody wanted, yet they did it anyways, it was just so predictable, the characters were bland and unintresting, extremely cheesy. I'm not panning it just because the animation was, as I said earlier, very well done, but I'd just rather watch the first movie (the only one that was actually decent, it's a 6/10)\rRecommended for fans of the series and maybe for parents that want to take their kids, but they won't enjoy it much."}], "recommendations": ["kung_fu_panda_2", "how_to_train_your_dragon_2", "how_to_train_your_dragon", "the_incredibles", "the_adventures_of_tintin", "shang_chi_and_the_legend_of_the_ten_rings", "kung_fu_panda", "atlantis_the_lost_empire", "spider_man_into_the_spider_verse", "the_croods", "big_hero_6", "indiana_jones_and_the_temple_of_doom", "my_little_pony_the_movie", "the_lego_batman_movie", "onward", "doctor_strange", "rango", "the_forbidden_kingdom", "toy_story_4", "rio_2", "avengers_age_of_ultron", "cars", "super_8", "bumblebee", "thor_ragnarok"]}
