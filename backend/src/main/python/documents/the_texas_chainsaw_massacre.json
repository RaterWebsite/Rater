Instead of making an exact replica of the 1974 cult film, they take the basic idea and run with it, adding a great likable cast, gritty camera work, and a top notch musical score. While this is the remake that started the trend, its also one of the best horror films of the 20th century. 9/10."

      "text": "In August, 1973, five teens set across the Texas highway on their way to a concert, when a chance encounter with a suicidal hitchhiker forces them to stop for help. As they wait for the town's hick sheriff to collect the body, two of the teens run off to a nearby house to use the phone, where they come face to face with a murderous clan of cannibals and their chainsaw-wielding son, Leatherface! THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE is reborn in Platinum Dunes' 2003 remake, but where so many other attempts to revitalize the 1970's and 80's Slasher craze have failed, THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE succeeds in shocking and terrifying a whole new generation of moviegoers. It is just what a remake should be, honoring the original with the same basic plot outline and characters, while creating its own unique identity and mood. Marcus Nispel's washed out color palette is drowned in putrid greens and blues, which give the misty forest and dilapidated hallways of the Hewitt household a sickening overall effect. While this version does feature more gore, it is not built on simply disgusting the audience, but takes just as much time developing a deep-seated terror and suspense. This creates moments of intense anticipation that pay off in jolting shocks! Although Nispel has chosen to fill the cast with familiar teen favorites, Scott Kosar's script makes them likeable characters with whom the audience can relate. The best choice obviously comes in the decision to hire R. Lee Ermy, whose crass behavior and vulgar humor make him perfect in the role of Sheriff Hoyt. Ermy dominates the film, and becomes even more sadistic and frightening than Leatherface, himself! Andrew Bryniarski's fast and forceful approach to the character makes him very imposing as well, even if he falls slightly behind Gunnar Hansen as the iconic killer. TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE may not leave the same lasting impression as its predecessor, but its horrifying, edge-of-your seat excitement easily makes it the best remake to come out of the 2000's.\r -Carl Manes\rI Like Horror Movies"

Critics might not like it because they are comparing it to the oringinal, but they have to understand that the original was made in the 70's! I saw the original and I thought this new one was better. Maybe it's because I have seen my share of horror movies that came after the 70's version so when I actually saw the original it didn't have the same effect it had on others who saw in the 70's. TCM(2003) delivers that goods. Not only did I scream and jump, but I also felt sick and creeped out just watching and thinking about what was gong on. I would recommend this to anyone. Don't pay attention to the \"oldies\" who watched the original when there were no good horror movies out there. Go and see this new one! You actually feel and relate to the characters, which never usually happens in horror movies."

It doesn't rely on buckets of blood since it was low-budget. This reimagining just amps it up with gore, lots of blood and too polished in terms of production values. The characters are forgettable which makes you care less if they suffer and die. R. Lee Ermey doesn't even bring any justice as the impersonating sheriff who's also a member of the insane family. His death scene made me scream \"Hell yeah!\"; unlike in the original where the hitchhiker is killed during the final chase scene that made my heart beat faster. Leatherface in this movie is just ridiculous, his mask looks like a clown mask shoved in an easy-bake oven. The original mask is made of flesh from past victims and poorly made. It tries to recreate the original scenes with no sense of subtlety. A shameless remake that doesn't deserve to be seen."

      "text": "Deliverance meets The Hills Have Eyes in this sicker, meaner remake of Tobe Hooper's 1974 classic. It misses the point of the original as so many of the things that movie gets praised for aren't in this one. There's not even any indication that the Hewitt's are cannibals in this version. Yet if you're a sucker for gore and grime there's still a decent time to be had here. You just have to deal with some pacing issues.Things don't really get going until the extended chase sequence, which covers a wider variety of locales this time around. Until then it's just watching the five survivors ignore the incredibly obvious signs that something isn't right and getting subjected to acts of increasing cruelty. The events are so disgusting and sadistic that the whole thing feels more like a torture porn flick than a slasher film.Let me tell you, the protagonists here are some real dummies. On top of the aforementioned inability to pick up on how sketchy their situation is, a few of them apparently have the attention spans of squirrels with ADD. Regularly getting distracted from their task of finding one another to poke around in places that don't make sense. Like how at one point a guy stops looking for his missing buddy and decides to scan the potential killer's refrigerator instead.When all is said and done this is little more than a pointless, mean-spirited, and brainless bit of savagery. Watching people get tormented by backwoods psychopaths still has its appeal however. It's far from scary, but could very well make you wince and gag. Plus, even at its dullest it's more energetic than the original. Making it a fine alternative should you want a more lively take on the premise with an extra layer of filth added on top."

The direction from Niespel Marcus is quite stylish, the cast, despite only containing  good looking actors, is good. It is really worthwhile."

The reason is simple, for this one, they actually got a real cast that include two of my favorite actors and the gorgeous Jessica Biel. This story isn't any different than the other ones. A bunch of friends on a road trip take a wrong turn and find themselves being hunted by a mad man. The film is full of gore, bad jokes, and beautiful people, it's really nothing out of the ordinary, except for the cast. Great actors can make anything entertaining, even the most bland and repetitive film gets new life when you introduce a cast like this. Three extremely talented and under appreciated actors, give support to the less experienced cast members, and while much of the film was focused on Biel and Leatherface, you could still see the influence of the veteran stars on the rest of this cast. If you don't like Horror, this film won't change your mind. If you're looking for originality, you won't find it here. If you're looking for some good performances from a very talented cast, that is something The remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre will give you."

      "text": "Another Long March to the Slaughterhouse!\r With  a budget many times that of the 1974 drive-in classic on which it is based, Marcus Nispel's \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" delivers proportionately fewer thrills and no discernible suspense. It is, instead, a long march to the slaughterhouse that seems to take forever to get going and, once it does, goes nowhere that hasn't been visited before by more talented filmmakers.\r Inspired as much by Jonathan Demme's 1991 \"Silence of the Lambs\" (from which it borrows its repulsively detailed inventory of a killer's lair) and by David Fincher's 1995 \"Seven\" (the bled-out color and atmosphere of decay) as by Tobe Hooper's original film, this movie seems painfully derivative just where Mr. Hooper's was technically crude but quite original: in its application of the psychology of horror.\r Very much a product of its time, the original was a paranoid vision in which a band of hippies fell into the clutches of a monstrous family evolved from Richard Nixon's middle Americans. Mr. Hooper imagined the rotting nuclear family formed by the Sawyer clan (oddly renamed the Hewitts in the remake) exacting its final parental revenge on the flower-power generation, represented as a group of helpless children.\r In the remake, with Hollywood's current master of budgetary excess, Michael Bay (\"Pearl Harbor\") as co-producer, the killings have little sociological or psychological resonance. This is a blunt and graphic gore film, replete with close-ups of splattered brain matter and twitching severed limbs.\r To his credit, Mr. Nispel, a veteran of music videos making his first feature, does not take refuge in camp humor; he plays the violence as straight and as punishingly as possible. But punishment is not what the action public of 2003 is looking for: since \"The Silence of the Lambs,\" the audience has been encouraged to identify with charismatic killers as they go about their business, something the remade \"Chainsaw\" staunchly refuses to offer.\r From R. Lee Ermey's degenerate small-town sheriff to Andrew Bryniarski's hulking Leatherface (the chainsaw-wielding killer, now with a mask fashioned out of human flesh), the villains are either too grotesque or too remote to invite easy assimilation. Reduced to identifying, uncomfortably enough, with the victims (chiefly, the lovely but inexpressive Jessica Biel), the audience made its dissatisfaction vocally clear at a recent New York preview screening of Mr. Nispel's film, which opens today nationwide. Rather than exhilaration, this bilious film offers only entrapment and despair. It's about as much fun as sitting in on an autopsy."

So when this was initially announced I really had no interest in seeing it, Especially after finding out Michael Bay was involved. Until that awesome sales trailer came out followed by what may be the best horror trailer ever released spliced with the songs Song to the Siren by This Mortal Coil and Signal to Noise by Peter Gabriel. And when it finally came out I still went in quite cautiously besides the solid buzz. And when I walked I had witnessed one of the best horror remakes of all time. The film works as an uber polished pop version of the original with truly striking cinematography and solid performances all around especially from Jessica Biel who redefines what scared is in horror movies. The movie is a fast, intense, aggressive, stylish nightmarish horror ride with scenes that just stick to you long after it's over. Although it doesn't have the impact of the original or the high quality I'd be lying if I didn't say they truly did a fantastic job with the material proving they had reason to revisit it.Budget: $9.5MBox Office: $107M9/10"

However, after watching the original since then, I realize that this version is inferior to the original in almost every way. Yes, the acting in the original can be a little campy and cheesy. Yes, the original's cinematography can also sometimes feel more dated, however sometimes the cinematography of the original absolutely surpasses the cinematography of the 2003 remake. There's a shot in the original where the camera follows a female character as she transitions from sitting on a swing to when she stands up and walks towards the house, the camera just glides under the swing she was sitting on and follows her in perfect harmony to the house. It's honestly done in such a beautiful and epic fashion. Unfortunately when it comes to this remake it's very much a product of it's time cinematically speaking. Does that mean it's bad? No, just means it's not that great either. When it comes to remakes of classic horror movies, this one is better than most. Is it as good a remake as the 2013 remake of 'The Evil Dead'? No, absolutely not."
