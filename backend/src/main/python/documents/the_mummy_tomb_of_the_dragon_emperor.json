Oh, and the emperor - he was invincible when he was awaken; then he drank from the well of invincible water, and then he finally became invincible once more. A few seconds later, the good guys kill him. Darn. Oh, and the actress looked nice in her dresses."

It moves the setting to China, that's a little disappointing but not unforgivable; it ages one character almost a decade while leaving the others unchanged, but with all the ancient mysticism that they have been involved in maybe they don't age anymore; it changed one of the main characters, now what the h***! No back story, no notice, no dramatic character death, no attempt to patch the story at all, it's like the filmmakers just gave up on the story and characters. I mean, this wasn't some secondary character, this wasn't the first sequel, it was the third movie in the series and they swapped a main character, talk about breaking the third wall, they might as well have the characters smile and wave at the camera. This movie could have been great, it could have been fun, but it could never be the \"The Mummy\"."

      "text": "The third Mummy movie is easily the worst in a franchise, turning bad a series that was just average so far. Special effects and large action set pieces take precedence over character development and plot. This may seem standard of any blockbuster but it is particularly glaring here. The characters are hastily drawn sketches, the romance feels forced and the drama is dead from the outset. The action that is supposed to thrill instead feel hollow and lifeless as we don't care what happens to anybody and we don't feel the significance of what is taking place. The plot is flimsy, made worse by ridiculous twists and coincidences where belief isn't so much suspended as it is thrown off a bridge. If visual effects are all that you want, you may get brief enjoyment out of it. If you want something of substance, something with heart, then you should look elsewhere."

Truly, a horrible horrible movie. When your high point in a movie is an unexplained run-in with asian yetis, and a truly uninspired scene of yeti football, you're doing something wrong. Worse is the budget, you'd think they could spend a little on writers this time around. I wouldn't wish this movie on anyone, truly a torture device of mediocrity and insipid idiocy."

This latest installment is very different from the previous 2 movies. Although awesome I found it very hard to get used to the China setting rather than Egypt. I think that's partially because of how many times I've seen 1 & 2 on DVD or on TV. Other than that it has its cheesy moments just like the first 2, perhaps a little more. The CG is great and it has some unique FX. As far as Bello replacing Weisz (sp?), I actually noticed it more than I thought I would. But it didn't really come across as replacing.......she was almost like a different character. Not saying Maria Bello's performance wasn't good, but besides the english accent she seemed different. It almost would have been better to have some backstory of Evelyn and Rick divorcing with Bello being the new wife. Once again this opinion stems from the shear amount of times Mummy 1 and 2 have been viewed. Other than that it was an entertaining popcorn flick."

The first Mummy film became an instant classic in my book.....its simply simply a classic \"popcorn movie\" with a certain charm that dosen't tarnish over the years (ive seen the movie at least 100 times). The second Mummy film choked on its own extravagance trying to top the first film by adding 100s more effects shots that held the film back more than it helped.....in other words, the second Mummy movie pales in comparison to the first. This 3rd offerring......i just couldnt think of this as a film in the \"The Mummy\" franchise, it just didn't feel right. The action sequences are interesting.....but they are shot so quickly and edited so poorly its simply no fun to watch. The Yetis were.....neat.....and the whole field goal thing didn't bother nearly as much as the WHOLE FILM being a clutterred mess. Rick and Eveys characters seemed to be in the right place (Maria Bello did a.....decent job) but Ricks son Alex came off as annoying and his Chinese girlfriend didn't do so well either. Jonathon (John Hannah) gets NOTHING to do in this movie but sit their and look stupid.....and freak out when say.....an avalanche happens, and thats a shame.....i really enjoyed his character in the previous films, then again his character was written SO MUCH better in those films, here he is completely wasted. Its not a TOTAL loss.....but so close to it you may not even care, see with caution......either youll \"kinda like it\" or \"hate it\" completely."

Most of the criticism seems to be that it isn't really a \"Mummy\" film in the scarabs-and-sand sense, and that's true (of course if it was the critics would carp that the franchise was stale), but as a stylized adventure flick M3 is easily the match of the overhyped and overpraised Indiana Jones 4 with the benefit of being 30 minutes shorter and less self-serious (though, in fairness IJ4 *does* have a mummy in it, sorry Ms. Allen)."

But then, the film became entertaining, and good. This film is gleefully stupid and preposterous, and yet ridiculously fun to watch. I enjoyed this over-the-top film and it provided plenty of popcorn thrills and excitement even if the acting was B-movie at best and the script felt as if they made it up as they went along. Still, I had fun watching this film. It was the least of the trilogy, but it was still fun and at least I wasn't left pissed off like I was when I saw Indy 4. However, if you want the closest thing to a modern Indiana Jones, watch the Tomb Raider flicks they're pretty awesome."
