This was the perfect way for Knight to test the waters and sample this new look and feel to transformers and leaves all doors open for however they would wish to continue this series. It was a more personal story than any of the other movies in the series, but doesn't tie itself down with that. These producers and writers could even take the franchise in a more Marvel direction and make more films centered around one character, and bring them together in a major film, and based on the way that this film was presented, that style of presentation could really work for this franchise.    Overall, Bumblebee does everything that this series needed and tells a more down to earth story, while still carrying the epic proportions that Transformers always has. This may not be the most epic film in the series, but it is definitely the best and if they continue to run the series like this, Transformers fans have a lot of great films to look forward to."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Good action scenes, a seventies feel, just not quite interesting enough story-wise and too predictable to really grab your attention."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "There are moments in here that shine as the Transformers movie fans of the cartoon series have been waiting for.

While it's nowhere near as over-the-top and ridiculous as the rest of the Transformers franchise, it's still pretty ridiculous, and like the rest of the films, it's attempts at humor are forced and cringeworthy at best. The story also felt lacking and uninspired. A kid or teen befriending an alien or robot that can do great things and trying to a hide it from the government... Ya like we haven't seen that before enough times already. The action is decent enough in some moments, but not enough to really make up for the rest of the film's clumsiness and weak story, and the acting just isn't that great, as expected from this franchise by now for me (not even Hailee Steinfeld or John Cena we're able to make it worthwhile.)

The earth part was ok as well in the beginning with the cliche angry teen girl's story with finding bumblebee although it made no sense that he would be sitting all dilapidated in a wrecking yard and why if the transformers just discovered earth would they pick a car to emulate at all? About a third of the way thru though the producers seemed to wake up and remember that they  were making a teen film though so he changes the tone completely by bringing in a bf for the girl and having a bunch of silly cliche bonding scenes of bumblebee and the girl/boy.The evil decepticons sent to kill bb were pretty fun and the scenes with the military were decent.This film would be really good for the 8-16 yr old crowd but not so much for adults."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Bumblee was a breath of fresh air this franchise needed.

What it did wrong was everything else.There were bits of humour throughout, a few typical fight scenes that didn't really bring any excitement and a rather weak origin story that lacks depth and a solid villain. It's essentially a rather bare soft reboot to a failing franchise and while it's not as terrible as previous entries, It doesn't do enough to warrant any praise. It doesn't even break the mediocrity that the franchise has been bringing for years and that is this film's biggest failure IMO.

Ni siquiera super\u00f3 a Early Man, a la que ten\u00eda peor calificada hasta ahorita.Bumblebee, que trata sobre el origen del h\u00e9roe m\u00e1s adorado de la linea de Transformers, realmente habla sobre como se adapta al planeta tierra, un lugar en donde somos hostiles con las cosas que no conocemos.La pel\u00edcula es demasiado melodram\u00e1tica, con un personaje central que respeta el estereotipo de una persona rebelde y deprimida, con una familia disfuncional y que llama la atenci\u00f3n de chicos nerds que se convertir\u00e1n, \"accidentalmente\", en sus mejores acompa\u00f1antes. Hailee Steinfeld no act\u00faa mal y es muy bonita, pero el gui\u00f3n con el que est\u00e1 trabajando simplemente me ha dado una muy mala impresi\u00f3n. La recuerdo un poco en True Grit, por Ethan Coen y Joel Coen y su actuaci\u00f3n fue justa y prometedora, pero saltar de ah\u00ed a Bumblebee es un mal camino para estudiar su trayectoria.Bumblebee es melodram\u00e1tica, casi telenovelesca, tonta, absurda, exagerada, in\u00fatil, incoherente, il\u00f3gica y, sorprendentemente, tambi\u00e9n inc\u00f3moda. El personaje principal est\u00e1 destinada, desde el principio, a ganar y aprender a vencer las excusas que la historia le interpone, asimismo se refleja en su compla\u00f1ero Autobot para ense\u00f1arle lo que ella misma tiene que aprender y, as\u00ed, mostrarse como una mujer fuerte e independiente cuyo cabello se balancee al rimo del viento de la puesta del sol en el horizonte. Se necesitar\u00eda muy poca inteligencia emocional para disfrutarla plenamente, pues el sentimentalismo se fuerza demasiado en el p\u00fablico.Me aburr\u00ed demasiado r\u00e1pido esperando una sorpresa cinematogr\u00e1fica, pero ni visualmente es sostenible. Las secuencias de pelea y acci\u00f3n no est\u00e1 justificadas la mayor\u00eda de las veces, los efectos visuales son una copia y pega del cine de Michael Bay y los efectos especiales no son din\u00e1micos ni creativos, solo construyen escenas sin est\u00e9tica, atractivo o intriga.Lo que m\u00e1s me molest\u00f3 fue la carga \u00e9pica que le dan a John Cena. Se la pasa hablando con frases que lo tratan de hacer ver rudo, despiadado y fuerte, pero sin un contexto suficientemente solido como para enaltecerlo. Entonces solo se ve absurdo y en el momento dado se vuelve en amigo porque, pues, aquello que quer\u00eda matar lo salv\u00f3.Bumblebee es un ejercicio que se anula a s\u00ed mismo y te impulsar\u00e1 a salir de la sala inmediatamente o a aplaudir las haza\u00f1as de un golpe mercadot\u00e9cnico cuyo valor art\u00edstico, repito, es nulo. Hay gente a la que le ha agradado esta experiencia, pero considero que est\u00e1n realizando una mala comparaci\u00f3n. Trasformers jam\u00e1s ha sido un proyecto de valoraci\u00f3n, sino una campa\u00f1a de mercado, y no porque Bumblebee sea la campa\u00f1a mejor realizada de la saga significa que merece ser reconocida. Separar el reciclaje industrial de Bumblebee de la saga es como decir que una Oreo sabe mejor que las dem\u00e1s solo porque es gratis. Lo dije en mi rese\u00f1a de Aquaman: cualquier futuro film bajo cualquier estereotipo narrativo de acci\u00f3n, ser\u00e1 una verg\u00fcenza. Y Bumblebee no solo es una verg\u00fcenza, sino una tristeza enorme. Entiendo que es cine infantil y que la acci\u00f3n y narrativa trata de apelar a aquellos cuya experiencia en el cine sea joven, sin embargo, esa juventud tiene la oportunidad de crecer con par\u00e1metros narrativos que apelen a la innovaci\u00f3n, a lo inteligente y, m\u00ednimo, razonable. Pero si se continua promoviendo este cine, solo estamos promoviendo un vicio idiotico en el que la sociedad se puede estancar narrativamente con presupuestos que pueden ser usados para historias de mayor impacto.Mi mayor tristeza reside en el director, quien decidi\u00f3 participar en \u00e9ste proyecto y manchar un poco su muy corta carrera. Travis Knight, quien fue el Lead Animator en pel\u00edculas de calidad indudable como Caroline (2009), ParaNorman (2012), The Boxtrolls (2014) y director de Kubo And The Two Strings ha provocado que me mantenga al margen de sus intenciones o aspiraciones.Perd\u00f3n por extenderme demasiado, pasa a veces cuando me molesto."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Empty, vapid movie that dumb people who watch Lifetime or Hallmark will love.

He's scrappy (literally, you can see various car parts on his transformed body), but with a sweet personality.

They limited the number of bots on screen and remove all those useless characters. The story is more emotional and more focused.

Hailee Steinfeld plays so beautifully and John Cena was built like a brick house. The only thing I like about this film is the G1 Transformers robots that we all know and love. This movie is great, and I am definitely getting it on Blu-Ray!!"}, {"rating": "6", "text": "So I wasn't even planning on seeing this one, as \"Transformers: Age of Extinction\" left an extremely bad taste in my mouth, but since I was invited to watch this film and the reviews were mostly positive, I thought to myself: \"Uh, maybe it'll be fun\". And it is, but it's also not a particularly engaging movie, unfortunately. I'm not a Transformers fan. I didn't bother to watch the 1986 animated feature. Quite honestly, I never liked the idea of seeing talking robots in the big screen as it feels as though it's just a long toy commercial. No substance or anything. Plus, the Michael Bay movies only made matters worse, as those movies are incomprehensible, pointless and borderline offensive.With that being said, I still went into the theater expecting to see a good film. It wasn't directed by Bay, so it oughta be good. Good? No. Decent? Yes. I don't want to say I didn't have fun watching this movie. It certainly was entertaining for the most part. But it wasn't quite the game-changer it could have been. Mostly because of its unoriginal premise, some of the acting performances and cheesy plot elements. Now, the plot isn't exactly the most imaginative of all. Like critics and moviegoers have said, this film largely feels like an E.T. ripoff. This seems like something that would bring my score down a notch, but I honestly feel that although this movie was clich\u00e9d in some places, I think the characters' dynamic mostly made it up for it. There was solid chemistry between Charlie and Bumblebee and in fact, it might be the best thing this movie has to offer. Besides that, we have action sequences and while they are not especially memorable, I'm glad I can praise them simply because how much it differs from Bay's nonsensical directing style. There are no shaky cameras, no annoying lens flare or quick cuts. No disgusting yellowish color palette. The framing and shot composition are not extraordinary, but they are an improvement over the last 5 Transformers films' cinematography. While this movie boasts a more appealing look, it struggles a lot with narrative aspects. Without getting into spoiler-territory, the movie can sometimes make you question how and why things are happening. The military scenes are dumb and bear a resemblance to similar scenes in previous movies. Frankly, I couldn't take John Cena's character seriously and I feel like he was just there to provide another reason for people to see this movie. Another point that dragged me down was the humor. Maybe it's just me, but it seems that a lot of big blockbuster movies are trying very hard to make their audience laugh their asses off. I say this because the humorous scenes of the movie weren't exactly humorous, in my opinion. That happened because the jokes were very forced and poorly thought-out. Worse than that, they were unoriginal. Best case scenario, I chuckled a little bit. Worst case scenario, I cringed very hard. Another minor issue I had with the film is the main character's internal conflict (Charlie). Nothing wrong with the message itself, it's just that the writers could have found a better, more subtle way to show how Charlie goes from \"being scared **** of diving into the pool\" to \"splash!\".This movie is not bad. But for anyone who's looking for a substantial experience, you should lower your expectations.6/10."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Bumblebee is the best Transformer movie ever made and while that's not saying much, director Travis Knight simplifies the story humanizes the Bumblebee just right and makes you care for the human characters.

Overall a high 7 a B+."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Best Transformers movie yet! Hoping for a sequel. PLEASE NO MORE MICHAEL BAY! KEEP HIM AWAY!"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "The rebirth of a franchise that finds gold in regression.I can say with absolute conviction that this is easily the best \"Transformers\" movie to date.Considering those responsible for such remarkable production, you could never picture the dazzling, moving end product. Bay, hated and loved equally, comes back, but just as a producer, which denotes a good, significant step up. An act of redemption by screenwriter Christina Hodson, guilty of shamefully careless screenplays such as \"Unforgettable\" by Denise Di Novi or \"Shut In\" by Farren Blackburn. Director Travis Knight is a wholly different story; nominated twice for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature for the lyrical stop-motion feats \"Kubo and the Two Strings\" and \"The Boxtrolls.\" American singer Hailee Steinfeld has shaped an acting career brimming with victories, with an Oscar nomination for her practically flawless performance as Mattie Ross in Coen Brothers' \"True Grit\" and one Golden Globe for her unique Nadine in \"The Edge of Seventeen,\" my favorite coming of age film\u2014 Bo Burnham's highly praised \"Eighth Grade\" is still waiting in my bucket list. \u2014 These are the heterogeneous ingredients of a film that surprises not only for its tonal metamorphosis with respect to its predecessors, but the heart, vigor, and simplicity the film uses to weave its story. \"Bumblebee\" is a nostalgia-driven adventure of unsuspected narrative force, focusing on ever-present themes that movies don't get tired of digging into and, why not, mixing up such as friendship, adolescence and growing up with a doubtless 80s flavor, a time the film takes advantage of. Setting it somewhere between the most fantastic John Carpenter, \"Stripes,\" The Smiths and A-ha is the right time to get rid of any dispensable hassle, going back to basics and staying there, it's just Charlie and the 1967 Volkswagen Beetle in a survival race; zero Bayhem. The film takes its time to set up the underpinnings and to present our heroine's dramatic arch. She lives among abandoned vehicles, car relics, and teenager gloom; on her birthday, she ends up acquiring a beat-up, tiny yellow car, a vehicle that becomes her confidant, her bestie. We've already heard this story a thousand times, but let's face it: no one on planet Earth can resist clever, poignant feel-good movies, no matter time, place or mood, this always enjoyable sub-genre will get followers. Besides, due to Mr. Bay's pyrotechnic filmmaking, it was exciting to imagine such a story starring Bumblebee, in the 80s. The final result couldn't be better. Charlie receives a careful treatment, unfolding her wounds and trying to heal them so honestly that the most dramatic moments are painfully stabbing.  Bumblebee receives a dignified narrative background as well: he and his species are being hunted by a pair of Decepticons, which allows displaying the high-sounding, better-handled action sequences with finesse. The funniest, most emotional, tender character-driven moments take place in the first forty-five minutes of footage. The story points at the big finale alongside, via small doses of the trademark complicated, sometimes unintelligible terminology and chronology. The set-pieces, as opposed to those of its predecessors, like the film itself, are much more restrained and compelling, not so groovy or showy because of a realism beautifully rendered with impressive digital effects that, even without high-resolution IMAX screens, endows action sequences with humanizing character. There is a good lack of predictability threatening to eliminate core characters just mid-story through unexpectedly raw images that kids will struggle to bear, excluding PG-13 carnage, a handful of murders amusingly reduced to plasma. Certain continuity, pace and editing errors should be attributed to editor Paul Rubell, however, as a coherent whole, it is a resonant, overly enjoyable popcorn film.   Technically and artistically speaking, it's excellently made, the camera moves with finesse and puts special focus on the development scenes like this saga had never seen before, holding their feelings and tones and throwing them to the viewer; it's praiseworthy that every scene gets a precise treatment which justifies its place in the footage.  The '80s references and easter-eggs are juicy and countless both physically and spiritually.\"Bumblebee\" by Travis Knight gives life and hope to a franchise in its death throes through Steinfeld's charming, sincere performance, the heart of a script based on friendship and forgiveness, and the emotional narrative control that Travis stamps in all his movies. Without warning, the \"Transformers\" film franchise rises from the ashes, and despite its post-credits scene suggests a risky return formalized by Paramount Pictures' brand-new measures, it's better we rejoice now in the candor and simplicity of a film jam-packed with underlying shrewdness."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This movie improves on what little positive attributes the Michael Bay-formers movies had, and completely scrap all that was bad.The music is nostalgic af, the robots distinguishable from one another, the camera steady during battles, and they completely ditched the inappropriate jokes. This means that for once, people actually laughed ~out loud~ at the cinema.It's not the best movie ever, but it's a solid foundation for possible sequels. And it brought back G1 toys, which I appreciate oh so much."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This was a fun movie. I found there were some logistical story issues, but this is Transformers after all. Bumblebee and the main character were a joy to watch. They captured the 90's feel."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This is the best Transformers movie so far! This movie feels like what the original cartoon was. It does not need any lame jokes to carry it, unlike the past movies needed. Action was fun, and you can tell they took some of that action from the 1984 show. The characters were fun, a huge improvement from the other films. They felt real. It is a film I would recommend to see!"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Transformers found its allspark after all. With director Travis Knight and writer Christina Hodson, Bumblebee is the first Transformers film that has a tangible plot that\u2019s not lost in the CGI shuffle. The film is grounded and greatly benefits form a more character driven approach versus the spectacle CGI rat salad from the previous films. It\u2019s very remisicnent of classic Amblin films. There\u2019s so much heart and passion in this film and it actually takes the time to develop the characters. That\u2019s the key to great filmmaking."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Wow! what a difference from the other transformer movies. Excellent Movie! I've been really tired of these movies being just about :Cool robots that transform, explosions, sex, and models from victoria's secret that serve no purpose in the film other than to look pretty and lust after.Drives me crazy!!!! Transformer movies should be a kids movie!!! That doesn't mean adults wont enjoy it (star wars for example is a kids movie- Not saying this is like star wars- I'm just saying its was designed to be a kids film and they finally went that route with Bumblebee). All ages can enjoy this movie.All my complaints that I had for the other transformer movies are taken care of in this movie- here's the break down:THE INTRO WAS AWESOME! I think its what we all wanted to see since the very beginning of the franchise! The intro should always in my opinion get you hooked into the story within the first 10-15 minutes. This does just that.Story: Story telling is better than the other movies. ( which tells you Michael Bay didn't direct it). It's family friendly and light hearted thanks to Travis Knight which I think is a very good thing. I think Christina Hodson did a good job writing this script.Plot: Great, doesn't feel too much cliche in my opinion.Character development: excellent! you actually care about the girl main character on her journey in this film. it even gets emotional in my opinion. You feel for the Charlie (Main character) in her ups and downs throughout the adventure as well for Bumblebee. The chemistry between these two characters is excellent. Tired of spoiled brats and stuck up jerks that no one respects in real life being the main characters from all the last transformer movies.Action: Even better with better fight choreography.Even the transformers themselves look better in my opinion.This movie has heart! Transformer movie!? I know but it's true for this one. None of the other transformer movies in my opinion had any heart.Humor felt natural and landed throughout the movie in my opinion.Hollywood only cares about money. So I hope that this movie does better at the box office than all the other transformer movies. They need to know that this is the kind of movie you make that is based off of toy action figures for kids! (and TV show) This I can honestly say is one of my favorite movies. Please support this movie!"}], "recommendations": ["incredibles_2", "super_8", "avengers_age_of_ultron", "ant_man_and_the_wasp_quantumania", "x_men_apocalypse", "thor_ragnarok", "guardians_of_the_galaxy", "kingsman_the_golden_circle", "pan", "poseidon", "transformers_dark_of_the_moon", "king_arthur_legend_of_the_sword", "terminator_genisys", "the_chronicles_of_narnia_the_voyage_of_the_dawn_treader", "tomorrowland", "creed_ii", "jumper", "turbo", "max_steel", "teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles", "how_to_train_your_dragon_2", "riddick", "the_last_witch_hunter", "jack_the_giant_slayer", "9"]}
