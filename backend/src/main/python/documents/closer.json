Roberts character was also interesting and she played her self well in this role."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Closer is a movie about fear and maturity. It is about lonely people seeking lovers capable of fulfilling themselves and saving them in a certain way. People looking for strangers to entertain them in a childish attempt to find their own happiness. And they cover their fears with lies until the very end of the movie.\r Dan lies to Alice for a year not telling her that he is dating Anna. Anna hides her feelings for Dan from Larry and Alice lies about his real identity to everyone the whole movie (except in the scene in which Larry asks her real name in the strip club, because she knew he was not going to believe it anyway).\r Ironically, the only character that always tells the truth is Larry, what does not redeem him from his rudeness against people. Attitude which equals him to the others in the maturity level.\r Each of the four characters idealize people, fall in love and start relationships when they are actually not ready for them. They never try to figure out why the relationships are not working, they simply jump to another crush when they are bored or face the other person imperfections, showing immaturity to deal with problems. Dan falls in love with the beautiful red-haired foreigner and then suddenly goes after the pretty photographer in a demonstration of unstable emotions.\r The movie is full of smart dialogues and outstanding quotes. Most of them performed by the characters of Portman and Owen, which received some nominations and won a few awards for their supporting roles. I guess Alice most memorable quote defines the movie accurately. In the strip scene she says to Larry \"Lying is the most fun a girl can have without taking her clothes off - but it's better if you do.\" And this is what the movie brings us: an intricate and fascinating plot of individuals living a world of lies to fill their empty lives with fleeting pleasures. The director allows us viewers to be closer enough so we can see the dynamics of this relationships that reflect perfectly well the complex nature of our interactions in the world as human beings and the masks we use to hide ourselves and live as strangers."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Strange, weird. beautiful, endearing, funny and one of the great play adaptations. Closer features all the actors in their best form and the direction is great. I give this movie 88%."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "What on earth was Morgenstern watching or was it the fact he had to be different to the generally favourable reviews. This is a film which as a man made me uncomfortable because the character played by Law was such a complete ass. But then none of the characters are what one would call loveable. I think this movie would be ideal for someone who was trying to decide whether they wanted to enter the damage zone which relationships open everyone up too. Anyone who makes a claim that the film characters do not exist is really very deluded. Where do you think divorce, adultery and the other unpleasant forms of betrayal come from?  Some of it was very funny. In these \"girl power\" times I would recommend it to men and women equally because in this movie neither gender comes out too well."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Based on an award winning play Closer tells the story of four lovers across a four year period. The movies theatre origins are apparent throughout with its small cast and succession of two person scenes. While this is not necessarily a bad thing, most scenes are certainly well written and performed admirably by the cast, it can make their story seem very isolated from the outside world on occasions.\r Despite these excellent performances however the biggest problem I had with Closer is that, with the possible exception of Alice (Portman), it is very difficult to feel any sympathy for any of the characters and their predicaments. Throughout the film their behavior makes them continually come across as totally unlikable to the point that by the films conclusion the ongoing drama between them becomes closer to irritating than interesting."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Maybe it's Natalie Portman... maybe it's Clive Owen... or Julia Roberts or Jude Law. Closer keeps you fascinated with these dynamic performances. Mike Nichols proves his career did not diminish long ago following The Graduate."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "There is something about Closer than is entirely off-putting. It is not the fact that it is a film about four people that are, well, unsavory characters. I can handle films about people I do not care for. The problem with Closer is it feels like a 2000s drama that is soulless. I have seen this a few times before (The Reader by Stephen Daldry comes to mind immediately) and there was something about this film that made me feel as though it would not be my cup of tea. This was ultimately the case, even though I did keep an open mind while watching this film. The experience, however, is just far too hollow and director Mike Nichols' cynical look at love just feels surface deep. We all get that love is challenging and messy, but Closer is mostly unengaging and just seems to float by and offer obvious insight into the messy nature of love. That said, there are positives to Closer. As always, it is marvelously well-written for the most part and the acting is terrific. In particular, Natalie Portman steals the show, though Clive Owen turns in a good performance as well.Showing the romantic lives of Anna (Julia Roberts), Daniel (Jude Law), Alice (Natalie Portman), and Larry (Clive Owen), the film shows the four characters swapping dates pretty consistently. Alice and Daniel sleep together. Daniel and Anna sleep together. Anna and Larry sleep together. Larry and Alice sleep together. Everybody is sleeping with each other in this film. Complementing these scenes are the people finding out their significant other slept with somebody else. Everybody cheats here and the film does have a lot to say about infidelity. For Nichols, infidelity is clearly a common act, but one that needs to be admitted to immediately. Though common, it is still disgusting, but only if you do not admit to it immediately. Case in point, Larry cheats on Anna with a hooker but tells her immediately. Meanwhile, Anna is heavily criticized for sleeping with Daniel for over a year, but never telling Larry until he brought up his infidelity. Moral of the story: cheat on your significant other, but be upfront about it and things will be alright. This is a constant thread as the people consistently want confirmation that their significant others slept with somebody else and then only get mad when they do not admit to it immediately. Other than this, Closer offers insight into how sex can be used as a weapon to hurt others, people's insatiable desire to cheat on their significant other, and how love hurts and can never be enough to keep somebody. Insightful stuff.Closer is also plagued by its timeline. Jumping forward by years upon years at the drop of a hat, Closer lost me more than once in its timeline. All of a sudden, Daniel and Alice had just met and then, immediately afterward, it was a year later. This is where a large portion of the soullessness I mentioned previously derives from. This desire to speed things along comes at the expense of developing a connection between us and the characters. Yes, there is a lot revealed in the scenes shown, but the process of them falling in and out of love would be a lot more emotional and rewarding if we got to see more than just a highlight reel of their relationship.This said, Closer has great dialogue. I may mock its relationship insights, but it is hard to deny that its relationships are well created in the moments we are given with them. Here, they can be powerful at times, in particular when Alice and Daniel embrace after he admits to cheating on her with Anna. This scene is very emotional and highlights the tremendous performance by Portman. Throughout, she steals the show and really puts in an emotionally raw performance. No matter the scene, she is the highlight of this film. Similarly, Owen - as a scorned lover and pervert - is brilliant. He has a natural charisma and it really shows here as he able to play such a chilly character with a cool, laid back demeanor throughout. However, he is equally adept at turning it up a notch, such as when he confronts Julia Roberts' Anna about her infidelity. An intense scene, Owen wins the scene by capturing both the anger and the pain that Larry feels in this moment as he presses her for intimate details about Anna and Daniel.Though disappointing, Closer affords a great opportunity to watch great actors do their thing. Other than a few scenes that were noted above though, Closer lacks the emotion and insight needed to actually pull off a film of this type. None of its takes are revolutionary and instead feel entirely derivative and cliche takes on love, rather than an examination into the lives of these characters."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Beautifully acted and directed movie from the legendary Mike Nichols, this movie avoids cliches and is a very sweet romantic drama that just follows your head for days.

This is a world view that has not been informed by genuine hardship. It is an A Level students view of modern love.

First time I do, but I think this movie is worth it. Some people here have obviously never seen a bad movie and should go to the cinema more before they drop comments. calling this movie \" the worst [they] have ever seen\" is either admitting they have very little to compare to or conceiding they were shocked/felt insulted by the movie (which in itself doesn't mean the movie is bad). Some may never have lived such situations or felt such feelings, and/or find them to be the expression of a pervers nature. This just isn't a movie on the way human beings sometimes cooperate to make a better world. Deal with it. As for the dialogue's they may not be realistic when removed from the scenes to which they belong, but who cares ? cinema isn't about writing everyday life exactly like it is, it's about giving the illusion of everyday life. If you watch this movie with an open mind, you'll get sucked in. If you're just waiting for an occasion to rate julia roberts acting, or if you came because the big names printed on the big posters reminded you of sweet love stories (be it in a galaxy far far away or in a nearby brothel), go chat on the forums, write to your favourite magazine, yell out your anger, but don't give this film a 0, your deception has nothing to do with its value. Every word, every sentence, especially in the breaking-up/fighting scenes came when and how I wanted them to come. Maybe noone in real life would be so crude (and I honestly don't see why not) but we've all deeply wanted to !

You may hate these people after seing the movie... but how is that bad ? you've felt strongly against them : this movie has brought you strong feelings ! Now you know who you definetly are not (although I dare think that whoever says he/she is not even a little bit concerned is either a liar or has lived his/her entire life in a box, alone). Now to the \"honest but shallow/hollow exploration of the human nature\". I am French and have lived in France many years. I was culturally brought up by french cinema and I therefore know what a hollow movie on human nature is, I have seen many failed attempts, (Just think that only the \"good\" ones make it abroad, and even they have a hard time), watched everlasting minutes of raw rape scenes, bared crying men on stools in empty rooms for half an hour, and heard endless, pointlessly intellectualized dialogs. This is not one of them, this movie goes to the point and it gets there fast. Sure, it doesn't explore every aspect of the characters' lives but that just makes it more universal. Most people agreed on the fantastic acting (Owen, Law, Portman AND Roberts) and the beautiful score, so I'll just skip that.

The film is so horribly self conscious it made me grimace to watch it, it was as though the only thought given to the film was that raw automatically equals artistic quality.

The feature shines on performance level and utterly completes it objective through Natalie Portman, Jude Law, Clive Owen and Julia Robert's who are in their A game.

I don't think the movie is bad, it has a lot of qualities, but it's tiring because it never gets beyond the conflicts and unresolved issues between the two main couples. It's like an ongoing relationship discussion.The film features two couples: on one side we have the ex-American stripper Alice and Daniel, an obituary writer and potential writer; on the other we have the photographer Anna and the doctor Larry. The two couples know each other, by different casualties, and they develop cross-relationships in which the conflict and divergence are permanent. It's a complex story, in which couples switch, separate, mix, fight. It's a smart story, very well written and with excellent premises, even though there is a good deal of improbability in it all: in fact, I can't conceive of anything like this happening in real life.The best part of this film is the excellent performance of the four main actors: Julia Roberts, Natalie Portman, Jude Law and Clive Owen. We can't say anything bad about any of them, they were up to the challenge put to them, they incorporated their characters wonderfully, and they did a truly remarkable job of dramatic interpretation. They are the ones who make the movie really worthwhile. Of course, they benefited from the good material they received and the really good dialogues they were given. About this, a note of warning: these are dialogues that often use and abuse heavy slang, and this should be taken into account by more sensitive audiences and young people before seeing the film.Technically, the film has ups and downs... I really liked the cinematography, which looks somewhat ethereal and liquid thanks to a good use of color and contrast, shooting angles and London's low sunlight. The choice of filming locations also seemed happy, and the construction of sets and costumes is within what I expected. However, Mike Nicolls failed when he wasn't able to give more dynamism to the film, which is always lukewarm, slowly cooked, with a tiresome, drowsy rhythm that numbs the audience. The soundtrack doesn't help to overcome the feeling of tiredness and drowsiness, with the choice of the song \"Blower's Daughter\", in the monotone voice of Damien Rice, proving particularly unhappy."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "This is a drama film with romantic elements and it covers themes including trust and deceit. I thought it seemed relatively well thought out, with interesting characters and a decent cast (more on that later). It is a little slow to build, plot pace wise but I found it overall a relatively easy watch. I felt there was a sense of oneupmanship (or oneup-woman-ship perhaps may be more to the point) present not long after the film started.This is very much a 21st century film, with the internet playing a part in the plot. Its quite saucy, as you might imagine. Some scenes were quite amusing - I found myself giggling at times. Some of the scenarios, or plot details, are a bit ludicrous but also quite cringey - if your very much a prude then this film may well not be for you, I'll say that much. The characters all seem to be of an aspirational type - that is, middle class but seemingly keen to climb up to upper class status or higher/upper middle class types, which may put some people off. There is a definite sense of some of the characters seeming brazenly quite selfish but then things don't go as easily as they may hope. I won't elaborate so as not to spoil the film for potential viewers.  Its one of those films where the viewer finds themselves trying to guess what will happen next, what someone will do and whether or not others will realise and in which we potentially ponder the ending quite far ahead of time. If your not at all keen on character driven dramas, then, as I've said numerous times before, this may not be for you, as it does consist of a lot of dialogue and not especially exciting scene settings.Cast wise, the film stars Julia Roberts as Anna, a professional photographer who is a little jaded perhaps. Jude Law plays Dan, a far too casual yet somewhat sharp witted guy, while Natalie Portman plays Alice and Clive Owen plays Larry. There is definitely a meeting of minds, type battle of the wits situation between Dan and Larry, which is quite well portrayed, while Alice comes across as a more sensitive type.Content wise, the film contains constant, quite strong sex references, some nudity but no full frontal. There is also strong language present and some violence, although nothing especially graphic. Characters are shown both smoking and drinking alcohol at times. The film has been given a 15 rating to reflect this content.The plot seemed very insular, to a point by which it may feel a bit nauseatingly claustrophobic. I suppose it depends on your personal preferences, what type of films you enjoy and so on, as to whether this would appeal to you. It is definitely unsettling at points, although its hard to explain precisely why.Its hard to say whether I'd recommend this film or not. It features a good cast and has a few amusing moments, although it isn't for very prudish people and neither will some plot aspects appeal to some, such as the selfish nature of some of the characters and the social class aspect present too perhaps.
