      "text": "ok a paedophile movie, very disturbing.But Jeremy Irons character of Humbert was not only annoying, but also pathetic, because he is so weak, although he should have a lot of experience. Dominique Swains performance on the other hand was top.And the end was also ridiculous, so much drama for nothing."

      "rating": "8",
      "text": "I watched this movie on internet, (18 years after its release!) and I absolutely loved this film. The end made me cry and wanting more, perfect cast, Dominique and Jeremy are great together... I got to watch the 1967 version now, and read the book too. Amazing."
