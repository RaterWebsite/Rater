This Second World War story is based on a best selling novel but its adaptation here is protracted and bloodless and must be classed a major disappointment. Young Sophie Nelisse, as the titular character, looks the part but her line delivery at times comes over as phonetic. The production itself looks immaculate, but again this is also a big problem. as everything is just so pristine. At one point Emily Watson berates the girl as being 'filthy' when in fact she looks as if she is on her way to a photo shoot. A bogus in-authenticity pervades and prevents the film from generating any true emotion or pathos. John Williams' pretty score adds to the detrimental effect and actually feels as if it belongs to another type of movie in another era. A couple of scenes do ignite. The cellar search grabs one's attention temporarily and the ending, coming as it does from left field, causes one to stir in a way that the rest of the film never does. I also have to mention that the scene where Geoffrey Rush plays his accordion whilst everyone is hiding in an air raid shelter, made me think that the cast were going to start singing Oom Pah Pah a la Carol Reed's musical Oliver!  One thing I did like was the unusual narrative device which is intrigueingly employed at the beginning and used to devastating effect at the end."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Markus Zusak in my opinion is one of the better modern novelists. I've read most of his books, out of all of them, no question, my favorite is The Book Thief. I often recommend this book to almost every book-lover, so it's to no one's surprise that I was looking forward to this movie, because out of what I had seen in the trailers, it seemed fine. However, after seeing it, I still recommend the book, because if you only see the movie, you will be simply missing out.\rI've never watched a movie by Brian Percival before this one, so I can't compare this movie with some of his other works, but from what I've seen, I can't really blame the shortcomings of the movie on the director. There are some enjoyable and well-done scenes in this movie, it's wonderfully shot. Two exclusions to take into account - the overall feel seems off, if you've read the book you will get what I mean. The movie is much more relaxing and somehow warm than the book, but I will leave out anything specific for the sake of spoilers, and second:  the length. This was my primary consearn when I heard about this movie, because I know for a fact that you can't fit a 500+ page novel in a 2 hour movie, you have to leave some stuff out if you can. In the case of The Book Thief - there is almost nothing to leave out without ruining the experience in the process. I blame the director for these, because for one - since it's a book, I suppose it's simply his view on things, but even at that, I can quote out passages that prove the setting is off, it's like he has read the book once. And for the lenght - if you see the movie, you will notice that this movie is not cheaply made, I think they could have gone the extra mile and it wouldn't have costed them that much to add another hour like the movie deserves.\rIn the end, story-wise, we get 3 developed characters, 2 semi-developed and a lot - simply missing from the plot. Also gone is the intriguing narrative that is present in the book (not absolutely, but noticeably). The movie simply coudln't handle the whole plot, but even if I look at it as simply a movie - the characters are still underdeveloped.\rThe acting in the movie is good, most notable was Geoffrey Rush, he is just the perfect fit for his role - everytime he was on screen you could sense it, he is, by far, the movie's highlight when it comes to acting. My biggest disappointments were Sophie N\u00e9lisse who was a terrible choice for a protagonist - she was bland and had little to do with the character from the book when it comes to personality, and also Nico Liersch who had just two moments in the movie where he was good-ish, the rest was terrible and I don't know who in their right mind chose this boy. He just seems to not feel like acting in half the movie, and he is supposed to play one of the more-important roles. Also, on a side note, the guy who plays his father, couldn't find his name - he is terrible too. Guess it runs in the imaginary family.\rWhen it comes to the soundtrack in the movie, I have to point out that there were two moments where the soundtrack was being weird. I won't spoil it, but I'm pretty sure any normal person will notice it if they are paying attention.\rAll in all, my biggest gripe with the movie is it that it's too short - there is no character development, very weak narrative (compared to the book), pathetic ending... all in all - a very weak script adaptation by Michael Petroni, which is no surprise to me. I still say - read the book, it's great and I believe you will have a lot more fun with it. If you are a fan of the book and are curious, however, give this movie a chance, because even with all of the above - I'm rating a 7/10, because all in all it's enjoyable - it's shot nicely, it's even beautiful and creative at times (just not as often as it should) and it's still worth your time if you don't go in expecting a masterpiece."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I normally read books before watching their film adaptations. My family, however, forced me watch this before I had the chance, so I cannot compare the movie to the book. But judging the movie by itself, it was thoroughly entertaining, mature, and artistic. In my opinion, it is better than most movies I have seen in quite some time. My favorite thing about it is that it did not need to resort to graphic violence or overly pompous special effects to create a memorable experience. Although the story can be a little too predictable and trite at times, it still delivers a strong impact and generates much sympathy for the characters. I loved the atmosphere; it felt so authentic and harked back to a feeling of closeness with one's family that seems to have been lost in today's society. Overall, this movie is good, not superb, but definitely worth a watch."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This movie did not look like any fictional tale, but was very realistic, that happened back in the 40s. It was based on a book of the same name. The filmmakers given soul to the movie with a great adaptation. This children's movie was awesome to watch if you are a fan of this genre. It was set in the backdrop of world war two in Germany, which chronicles a 8 year old girl\u2019s life during those times.\r The movies based on world wars are always interested either it was fictional or real. There are not many war movies which tell from the perspective of German\u2019s especially their citizens who are forced to do many unbelievable stuffs. This movie was pure drama which tells only a family\u2019s struggle over the rule of the Nazis.\r The performances were hypnotised me a lot. The old man role, Hans was played by the great Geoffrey Rush and the little girl, both of them were the highlight of the movie. In fact, one of the Geoffrey Rush\u2019s best movies I have seen, I went speechless for his acting in the movie. The girl was also so good in fact she was the backbone of the movie.  Except those two, few other characters were shown in brilliant shades such as Max, Rosa and Rudy.\r I don't know why this movie did not qualify in many categories for the 2014 Oscar. A fine movie specially made for events like this by the Unknown filmmaker for many of us. It is a must see in my opinion, in the end everything is left to the audience and their movie tastes.\r 9.5/10"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "The Book Thief is a slow paced emotional masterpiece that delivers a quality script and cast.

I actually had great expectations about this movie, I had heard of the book a long time ago. It disappointed me. It's unreal, and fake. The girl reacts in a very artificial way to the things that happen to her, it tastes like lie. The movie is full of empty speeches, that sound good but mean nothing at all. The characters are cursory. You get the sensation the director is trying to tell you something, but in the end he's just saying obvious stuff like it's amazing. They say \"We have to. We're people\" or something like that all the time. I was like: don't you say? Don't get me wrong, it's a good start for a reflection when it goes with other information.

First off, the title, \"The Book Thief\" doesn't even really apply to the movie at all. She steals books on 2 occasions but that's it. I don't even know what the story is. They're so many events going on and NONE OF THEM ARE IMPORTANT TO THE STORY LINE WHATSOEVER. The book thievery happens in a 15 minute span of the whole 2 hour movie. As a historian, it pains me to view their feeble attempt to cover WW2. The chronology of the war is all screwed up. They had Germans still deporting Jews in 1942, which all deportation had been dealt with. Lezeil and Rudy's fathers had been drafted into the war. Let us take the time to note these two gentlemen are in their late 60s or 70s. Now men like this were drafted into the war, but later in the war like 1944/45. The drafting for these men happens in 41. The movie tries to give the viewer a notion of time passing, BUT ALL THE CHARACTERS LOOK AND ACT THE SAME AS THEY DID IN THE BEGINNING OF THE FILM. All in all this is a pitiful movie, with weak to no apparent story line, pathetic acting, and a time line that went to ****"}, {"rating": "6", "text": "This is one of those trying-to-be-touching stories about a child growing up during war. This time it's a 9 year-old girl, who is adopted by new parents (Geoffrey Rush & Emily Watson) in Nazi Germany. She develops a love of books and shares it with the Jew hidden in the basement (isn't there always one?). The deliberate pacing means that it often takes too long for scenes to develop. There's a constant sense of dread, but never much real drama. So many plot points are predictable and the whole things feels manipulative in a Hallmark Movie of the Week style. While it's competently made, it's slight on emotional impact. On a side note: It also observes one of those silly Hollywood traditions. The people are all supposed to be German, but they speak English with a German accent (and a few actual German words are sprinkled about)."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "I honestly am siding with the critics this time.

I'm actually a bit disappointed to be honest."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "There are movies that can be put in a category appropriately labelled \u2018Oscar bait\u2019; and if there is one film that exemplifies that best this year, it is The Book Thief. Just like any cold or flu, \u2018Oscar bait\u2019 films have very clear symptoms. For starters, setting the film during The Academy Awards\u2019 favourite time in history, World War II is a must; having a young lead performance is another; previous academy award winners and nominees within the cast (in this case the illustrious Geoffrey Rush and the always impressive Emily Watson) always helps; and finally, the icing on the cake is the heavy-handed and manipulating (to the point of distracting) forced drama (in this case, a completely unnecessary voice-over). Put all those factors together and you have one of the most formulaic and familiar films during Oscar season this year. Read more!\r I have not had the pleasure to read Markus Zusak\u2018s supposed enthralling source material in which the film is based off of. The novel has received an overwhelming amount of accolades for presenting a story through the perspective of an unlikely narrator, but within Brian Percival\u2018s cinematic adaptation, unfortunately, this narration is far from effective.\r The Book Thief is by no means a terrible film. Mediocre at best, the film is a slow, long-winded feature that check-marks most of the essential plot-points of its far superior World War II predecessors. With just over a two hour run time, The Book Thief uses morbid images of death, sometimes involving children, to get its dramatized point across and elicit notions of pure sentiment.\r The film follows Liesel Meminger (French-Canadian Sophie N\u00e9lisse from Monsieur Lazhar), a newly orphaned child who is in the midst of pre-war Germany in 1938. Liesel is sent to live with a new family, Mr. & Mrs. Hans Hubermann (Rush & Watson) and like any child her age, she is very much reserved towards the strangers she must now call her parents. Hans does everything in his power to comfort his new daughter, finding a common passion in literature. Liesel, who is unable to read before she arrives to her new home on Heaven St., seeks the guidance of her new father, and together they find a small solace amongst the raging political ideology and war propaganda within Germany at the time. As you would expect, Liesel befriends a young, lemon-haired boy Rudy (Nico Liesch), and together the film recounts the innocent relationship these two share during one of the most atrocious times in our world\u2019s history.\r The scenes between Rudy and Liesel are some of the best within the film, surely capturing the simplicity of children trying to make sense of a very complex time. The very fabric of the relationships and loyalties between the people she holds dear to her are tested with the sudden arrival of Max (Ben Schnetzer), the son of an old friend of Hans. With cultural tension and war on the rise, Liesel and her family must turn a blind eye to patriotism in favour of humanity, finding a new way to survive without ever compromising their own integrity.\r Some of the finer points of The Book Thief comes from its impeccable acting talent. N\u00e9lisse embodies the young heart of Liesel and makes the character her own. While Rush and Watson make the best of the material they are given, Rush is always shining, capturing our hearts and the heart of Liesel any which way he can. His affections are as sweet as the lumps of sugar he magically surprises her with.\r Light on any real emotional responses, The Book Thief will less than likely make a dent during the award season. It\u2019ll probably be left mostly forgotten by the time nominations come early next year.\r Rush is a fine actor joined by an equally talented cast. Despite the great acting unfortunately, The Book Thief will surely be crippled for its cliched war narrative that we have seen time and time again. Applause is surely warranted for choosing to focus on elaborate set pieces, excellent production design, authentic filming locations in Berlin and talented actors, however the film neglects its chance to actually drop any emotional bombs on its audience."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Not a perfect film, thus it is compelling and effective.

This film suceeded for me where 12 Years a Slave failed because the director and the writers made me care about the characters who were truly brought to life by the actors.

Decent acting and visuals but not really worth making a film about."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "The Book Thief  , based on the novel by Markus Zusac, is a 2013 film directed by Brian Percival with Geoffrey Rush, Emily Watson and Sophie Nelisse .\r The film is set in Nazi Germany of Hitler and has as its protagonist a young Liesel , a young girl who is adopted by Hans and Rosa Huberman . With her there had to be the little brother but died shortly before. In the new school Liesel is teased because he can neither read nor write , but he manages to make a friend , Rudy Steiner , a boy who falls in love with her.\rNevertheless, Liesel is intrigued by the books and with the help of Hans soon learn to read. However, the situation will become very difficult with the outbreak of the Second World War and with the arrival of Max, a jew Hans decides to protect as the father of the first saved him during the First World War.\r The film turns out to be very interesting in several places although in certain parts could be made \u200b\u200bbetter.\rMeanwhile, let's start with the themes of the film ; as you can imagine we will talk about the persecution of the Jews, of martial law and war. These topics in the film , there are shown in a brutal manner , letting us see the horrors of that period ( such as did Schindler 's List) , but they are told in order to be accessible to all , that in order to be seen and understood even by smaller .\rBut not only are these the main themes of the film , there's another one in the film that proves to be the central one , which is the importance of culture . The culture that allows us to see things with greater awareness and makes us truly understand who we are , all represented during the dark period of Nazism, where ignorance seemed to reign supreme.\rParticularly interesting in the film is the fact that at certain points in the main narrator is nothing less than Death. I found it particularly deep and great monologue that is the end.\r The film , however , as I said before , it has some flaws. The main problem it can be found towards the end of the film that was supposed to represent the most dramatic part of the story (and a little ' dramatic it is) , but fails to hit deep in the viewer. Another small flaw (perhaps in some cases are a bit ' perfectionist but some things it is better to point out ) are the books that Liesel law . Ok that the film is an American production , but the film is set in Germany and then I would have liked to see them written in German not in English.\r The actors , however, are all of great, away from little Sophie Nelisse who plays Liesel , to Hans and Rosa interpreted both by a great Geoffrey Rush and fantastic Emily Watson.\r Talking about the technical side , the film is very nice, especially photography and soundtrack. The photography Florian Ballhaus proves to be accurate and in some places can do very artistic shots .\rThe soundtrack instead was done by one of the most talented and legendary composers of film, namely John Williams (do not know which of his films to mention , I will be spoiled for choice). Regarding the latter I have to say that , like all the scores made \u200b\u200bby Williams, is of great quality and an Oscar nomination if all is well deserved ( although I must say that if it would be well deserved as he deserved even those de The Hobbit: The desolation of Smaug ) .\r I conclude by saying that , although it is not a masterpiece , the film turns out to be very nice ( and lasts 130 minutes ) and will succeed for sure make you appreciate the many characters in the film."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "To my surprise this was a nice film which covered a lot of emotional content and giving us a fictional yet believable story of ordinary people in Germany during WW2.\r Credit goes to the use of death as the narrator of Liesel's story which was refreshingly different. It enabled the story to be presented in a more pleasant and child-like manner than a typical tragedy of suffering.\r One further positive is the effort taken to replicate a believable Stuttgart. Characters spoke realistic sounding German, English with a German accent or a mixture of both. Very few films enable the audience to understand another language whilst also telling a story in their own language. Also the use of real propaganda like posters, school choir songs, outfits, living conditions and public atmosphere all benefit the film and allow us to appreciate it better.\r Each of the 5 main characters are all very well acted. Geoffrey Rush nails a caring yet slightly silly father beautifully as does Emma Watson as the tough mother with a big, yet hidden, heart. The standout is Sophie N\u00e9lisse as Liesle portraying wonder, innocence, joy, sadness, or empathy with us ease; they definitely chose the correct actress. Nico Liersch as Rudy was solid as light-hearted, joyful best friend of Liesel. Ben Schnetzer as Max portrayed a jew in hiding we've not seen before, i.e. confident, understanding and caring towards those who are keeping him alive, without being frightened , tormented or helpless.\r My main criticisms are:\r * Mama coming to school to give Liesel good news - why do that and risk being exposed when such news can be delivered at home?\r* Bodies of those who died from their homes being bombed looking like people asleep. Surely if the filmmakers go to the effort of having vocal coaches for realistic German accents, then why not also give us authentic looking corpses.\r* Max appearing at the end. Where did he go and how did we survive? Not even some dialogue to explain how or why? His appearance lacks any impact upon the audience and lines up too nicely to be believable, i.e. cheap.\r* The film skips from sometime in 1943 to 1945 when Americans arrive in Stuttgart. What happened to Liesel in that time? The most interesting part of her story is what happened to her after the town was severely bombed.\r* The last 5 minutes of the film was quite rushed where it seemed to hurry up and finish the story without giving many details. I wanted to see a little more of what happens to the characters.\r* The ending is beautiful and a positive. However why can't we see how she ended up in Manhattan, New York. And why New York? Of all the places she would have emigrated to surely choosing New York was too cliched. I suspect it was chosen because many Europeans emigrated to the USA and New York is likely where they arrive.

I hated the insertion of German phrases with American accents.  Either English or German - or sub-titles please.  Everything seemed forced and formulaic.  Nice try, but I wouldn't recommend it."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "The problem with The Book Thief is that it feels as though Brian Percival (known for his work on Downton Abbey) has narrowed the whole story to the confinements of a stage play. Okay, one can still make staging methods effective (take Dial M for Murder), but the way the camera moves, the actors enter right to left, the design shuffles as time goes by, all feels robotic and even oppressive. There is a great war going on outside, agreed this film isn\u2019t directly intended to expose the war effort, but to signify the unconceivable act of the Nazis in true force one might need to dampen the glamorization of this storytelling.\r The structure of the film is designed in such a way that the final act is alive, theoretically, with all the acts. At least, you can be sure to be awoken by the final 30 minutes of tailored clich\u00e9s interweaving disaster and relief. I can admire the day-to-day life of our book thief Liesel Meminger (played by Sophie N\u00e9lisse), the core of the story, and her fascination with what lies beyond and above (she finds in the written word). This is, in fact, the most enjoyable aspect of the film, not to mention how well Sophie N\u00e9lisse holds everything together with her perceptive performance. The Book Thief feels alive and then the final years of the war are crammed into one act, an act spreading an entire story arc, an arc that would be better suited to capturing a separate film. It was never going to be an easy book to adapt.\r The film begins with the voice of death (narrated by Roger Allam), a voice instantly recognizable and a voice that will no doubt shadow the entire film. However, this voice seems irrefutably na\u00efve to the story it is telling. It takes a nap for a few years before coming back and interrupting the film three quarters of the way through. The film has made every effort to immerse its audience only to be pulled out of the picture by the voice of death shrewdly reappearing, perhaps to remind us that there is indeed a war going on outside of the street where Liesel lives.\r The cast is occupied with pleasantly accomplished performers (Geoffrey Rush, Emily Watson), however the Germanic approach of the film is inconceivable to any admirable performance. \u201cNein\u201d is apparently a plausible word in the English language? My take would be that if you are going to speak any German, then I want to see the whole film in German. And, in fact, I would have very much loved to see this film in German. Part of the disposition from the horrors of the depicted reality is bred from the fact that our characters are reciting English (could you imagine watching Downfall in English?). Consequently, and for other reasons mentioned, this film doesn\u2019t sink its claws deep enough. It balances on the rope of knotting together a less frightening past.\r I must note that the ending is fatefully superfluous. The tracking of the camera, in a present day, past mature pictures of a prosperous Liesel is grossly implemented by an ostentatious white iMac pulling apart the skin of the entire screening before us. This concentrated product placement, led by the palpable apple logo, was scornful to the foundations of the story and was the only symbol reminiscent on my mind as I left the cinema. Couldn\u2019t the final assemblies of the budget have come from elsewhere?\r I wish to admire this film, but it doesn\u2019t attempt the depth required of a child\u2019s eyes on the horrors of a war; don\u2019t look for such a powerful picture as The Boy in the Striped Pajamas. There were moments in which I obtained a deep affection for the family, their love of the lost and found. Yet, I feel that all along I was perhaps searching for a different movie altogether."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I always feel somewhat inadequate writing about movies with a massive understanding of their place and time. Perhaps it's an inferiority complex I carry around with me, questioning my own ability to pass judgement (such as it is) on a subject I am never going to fully appreciate and, if we're honest, have no right to pass comment on whatsoever. How very dare I sit, critically finger-pointing, at something that I have absolutely no comprehension of? It's like asking my ten-year-old to judge figure skating at the winter olympics.\r Approaching the all round general unpleasantness of the second world war in film is never an easy task, as it still holds a massive amount of importance to many, and rightly so. You need to be on your game, as events touched millions of people so radically that any apparent sign of disrespect, be it by a lackadaisical approach to storytelling or maybe an ambivalent nonchalance to the feelings of an audience most likely highly invested in its telling, would speak volumes about not only a lack of attention, but also cinema's duty of care to remember not only those featured, but all of those that go unmentioned.\r Unusually, the story we are told here is from a perspective less viewed. This is the story, predominantly, of a young german girl, Liesel (Sophie N\u00e9lisse) separated from her mother and tragically from her brother shortly before the onset of war. The reasons for their estrangement are never conclusively revealed, but it is hinted on occasion that her mother was rumbled for being a communist and subsequently disappeared with the shadowy aid of Hitler's minions. Liesel is adopted by the Hubermans, Hans (Geoffrey Rush) and Rosa (Emily Watson). Hans is an unemployed and aging accordion player with an honest heart and a caring soul. Rosa does other people's laundry to make ends meet, has a sharp tongue and little patience. She makes no secret that adopting Liesel was for financial gain, due to the allowance provided by the government for such care.\r And it is here that we spend most of the running time, as Liesel is introduced to education. She learns to read, aided buy the loving Hans, who creates an opportunity for her to create her own dictionary of words on the walls of their basement. Liesel, initially fearing her new surroundings becomes more comfortable, makes friends (and the odd enemy) and integrates herself into this little town with as few ripples as possible.\r She strikes up relationships easily as her happiness expands and the audience cannot help but smile as this sweet, radiant child begins to enjoy life for what seems like the first time. And then, without warning, Percival will have our lead dressed in the uniform of what has become a symbol of hatred and fear, singing songs praising the Fuhrer. This comes, of course, out of a childhood innocence and a over-riding sense of impending fear of speaking out, but the innocent vision turned mindless, wanton evil, even defended by ignorance is often a jarring juxtaposition for the audience to deal with. When the war inevitably arrives, then we are afforded the trials that come with a nation under siege. Normally, our English speaking souls would be watching the valiant endeavours of our brave soldiers fighting against the evil Reich, but here, the war is a bit player that does not feature as much as it might. There are air-raids and conscription, not to mention a fair degree of destruction and death, but for a young girl, this is as an accurate representation of her experiences of wartime in her home town as we could feasibly expect to witness.\r Director Brian Percival has done a truly admirable job, recreating a mostly happy perspective. Even in times of hardship and strife, normal lives continued to be normal, as much in this little german town as anywhere else in Europe at that time. Percival's skill here is making the war a subtle, circling monster in the life of a girl that has no real understanding of what earth-shattering events are going on around her.\r When this newly formed family unit takes in a young Jewish man because of a promise made in another time, Rosa's first thought is to turn him in, concerned that food is already scarce and her soup would become even thinner with an extra mouth to feed. Hans is resolute, however, and the young man is nursed back to health as Liesel warms to him, as a sister to an older, unfamiliar visiting brother.\r Nelisse's performance as Liesel is excellent, rounded and complete. It may just be fifteen or twenty minutes too long. Overall, however, a very satisfying experience all round."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "While this film definitely had it's flaws, it was enjoyable and worth watching. The first flaw is that it the entire movie was fairly slow, which may or may not actually be a bad thing. The main flaw is how they leave so many details out as well as some of the aesthetic details. More than a few years progress in the story and yet the only thing that changes in the main character is her hair style ans maybe a bit of makeup.

You will not find answer to those questions, but you will think and ask yourself the same things over and over again.. it is also a movie about unconditionally love and good in the evil times of the third Reich.

Amazing characters with a compelling narrative. You can't help but be drawn into  the world of the characters. It forces you to see the world through their own eyes and leaves you a better person. I haven't read the book but the movie left me itching for it. I highly recommend this movie."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "'The Book Thief' means well, it's an innocent film depicting a little girl's point of view of the war, so that means we will not be seeing a graphic view of the combat and violence of these horrific events that take place.\r Directed by Brian Percival (of 'Downton Abbey'), he adapts the widely acclaimed novel by Markus Zusak, Percival sets the ideal tone of the movie. The movie focuses on a young girl named Liesel Meminger (Sophie Nelisse) who meets her new foster parents (played by Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson) and tries to get comfortable in her new home. She begins to grow closer towards her foster father as he notices that she collects a lot of books. However, it seems that she is not quite as literate and nor is he, so they develop a sort-of school in the basement of their home and learn how to read.\r Later on, we meet a young, Jewish man named Max (Ben Schnetzer) who is a refugee and stays with the family. Liesel develops a friendship with the innocent man, discovering that they share a love for reading. Liesel even runs away to a hidden library somewhere to take some books and read them to Max for comfort. During her journey, she meets a young boy named Rudy (Nico Liersch) who doesn't mind getting into trouble for her, he seems infatuated, and so does she.\r This is a warm film, filled with some touching moments and is well acted...it has hints of being the next 'Hugo' (2011), but what does hold it back is its ability to emphasize on the horrors of the war, even though this isn't that kind of film, a lot of things seemed to be glossed over. There is an emotional impact throughout this movie, and it does its job to hold your attention for longer than possible. I guess, at times, it feels empty, almost like opening a shiny wrapped present, but what's inside is a box full of accessories, but not the product itself.\r It's a film I wanted to love...but I just admired it."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "I had to read The Book Thief for class and it is one assigned book which was surprisingly enjoyable.  The movie was just as enjoyable and followed all the book's key themes very well.

A strong, moving film that I highly recommend."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Um dos melhores filmes que eu j\u00e1 assisti.

It had some nice sentimental moments and it does make you have emotions inside and feel for the movie. However, the opening scene was pretty horrible. Coupled with Liesel's screaming and her brother dying, made me feel like I was watching a horror movie. Everything was decent except the opening scene."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "I thought this film was very good - the story I thought was particularly good, as I felt the characters were quite likeable, even the stern and very strict foster mother, Rosa, who seems unnecessarily harsh but in time we learn some of the reasons why she is so. I felt that this film did well in portraying life in one part of Germany during the years it covers - personally, I was relieved that it didn't cover, especially in any graphic sense, the more horrific elements of the war, as I've seen some pretty unpalattable war footage (real and fictionalised) in the past and I try to avoid very upsetting films. I felt that this film did a great job of portraying things how they must have seemed, if we were the main character, that of Liesel.I thought it was generally quite atmospheric - I enjoyed certain scenes set in large houses, where, for example, a large library is shown, with tall rows of shelves and a sliding step ladder for accessing one higher up. Visually it was a good watch. I thought the music used was well chosen - it didn't seem overbearing or too cheesy. It mostly consists of classical music played in the background of key scenes, although you do also hear the father figure, Hans, play the accordion on some ocassions as well. Cast wise, Sophie Nelisse plays the main character, Liesel. I felt she gave a great performance - she looks very much the innocent young child, trying to make sense of what may have happened to her mother and what may lay ahead, of what the future holds. She seems quite confused and angry at times and she seemed to play her role very convincingly. It would be hard not to feel emotionally concerned/attached to her, to some extent. I found myself feeling quite sorry for her when it became clear that she struggled to read and I found it heartening that she has such an interest in reading, probably mostly as I read quite a lot myself.Emily Watson plays the no-nonsense mother figure, Rosa. As already mentioned, she seems quite stern and looks the part of a maternal disciplinarian, thus I think she did well in this role. Meanwhile, Geoffrey Rush plays Hans, the father figure. He seems at first perhaps a bit gruff, a little bit of a loner of sorts maybe, keeping himself to himself when not with Rosa but he clearly becomes attached to Liesel and I liked the interaction between the two characters, when one tries to help the other. It felt, to me, like quite a realistic family relationship, I'd have thought. Other cast members include Nico Liersch as Rudy Steiner, Liesel's good friend and Ben Schnetzer as Max Vandenburg. The film features some ocassional narration, with some witty dialogue. It is relatively thought provoking. Overall, it is inevitably somewhat sobering but it is a quality film, well made. If I had to criticise it, then I'd say that there are one or two plot details which I felt seemed a little 'convenient' and perhaps didn't feel entirely realistic (a case of 'would that really have happened like that?') but otherwise, there's little for me to complain about or criticise really.Content wise, there is relatively little likely to especially offend or upset people, aside from the main war based theme but then, as I've said, this film doesn't focus on the most horrific elements of it, which may be a relief for some (me included). However, there is some mild violence, with fist fights shown and some instances of bullying, plus there are some corpses shown but there is no nudity and such people aren't shown with any kind of bloody injury or wounds, also said corpses are of people recently passed, so they aren't as horrific to view as perhaps footage in other (war related) films. There is little in the way of offensive language and there are no sex references. In light of this, the film has been given a 12a rating in the UK."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "'The Book Thief' demonstrates that hope and happiness can still grow to be prosperous even in the worst of times and those worst of times are firmly addressed here where the darkness quite literally narrates the entire film.
