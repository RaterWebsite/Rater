It is so weird because he uses the audience's intelligence in the beginning to make connections and then by the end he treats the audience as if they must told everything. Go see \"Inside Man\" again to see the director at his best, this is not it."

Its portrayal of the police as a force to fight racism is an all-too-generous distortion that borders on fabrication, and many of the characters come off like one-dimensional cartoons. This would be less troubling if it wasn't billing itself as a true story, but the fact that it is makes it feel misleading rather than just broad."

This is a harsh reminder of what people of color and even women, albeit one more than the other, went through back in this time. With some pokes at our modern times.

But this film is deadly serious and a commentary on the state of civil rights and the state of the country today, which is depressing. This was not so much because of the film itself, which was well-made and well-acted, but because of the end of the film, which, in effect, argued that nothing has really changed. Spike Lee is a great filmmaker, and I was surprised that he could not make the film more insightful. The actors were excellent."

And Laura Harrier as Patrice is a revelation.  However, casting Alec Baldwin was a terrible mistake - anybody could have done that role better, and the end cap was a choice I wouldn't have made, but I don't blame Spike for doing it.  You never would have seen that in a movie like Do The Right Thing, which is his magnum opus."

John David Washington and Adam Driver carry this movie, and they give some truly great performances, perhaps (dare I say it?) career defining! This movie is immaculately and creatively shot. The script is all at once funny, tense, romantic, sobering, and it ends on a great call to action. The one flaw is that I don't think the villains were very well developed, but the payoff at the end is so satisfying. I think maybe this film will even get some nods during the awards season! If I were to guess, I would say Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, and Best Sound Editing."

However, although predictable and seemingly formulaic at times, this latest effort of his did manage to go in some unexpected directions, and I mean this in a pleasantly surprised and good way. Lee cleverly and skillfully balances dark comedy with biting political, social, and of course racial commentary to make for one powerhouse of a film. In addition, John David Washington and Adam Driver both give bold lead performances. Overall, Lee really is in top form with this latest effort of his. Any film that enrages its audience or at least makes them ponder with its all too true and relevant themes and events is a pretty effective film in my book, and this film fits that bill perfectly needless to say."

      "text": "With the exception of two of his movies I am not a fan of Spike Lee or his persona but there is not getting away from it that BLACKkKLANSMAN is a superior movie and should be seen.The first half of the movie is sort of a roller coaster ride hitting on many subjects with humor and insight but it isn't til the latter part of the move that it becomes epic and shows wit, passion, satire, tension and relevance to the past and present. Written by Charlie Wachtel, David Rabinowitz, David Wilmont and Spike Lee the film opens with a film being made by Alec Baldwin playing a man who is giving a KKK speech and is followed with the panoramic crane shot from \"Gone With The Wind\" where Scarlett O'Hara is walking through a filed of hundreds of wounded and dying Confederate soldiers. There are other references to the film regarding Hattie McDonald and Butterfly McQueen but the movie references are mainly D.W. Griffith's \"The Birth of a Nation\" made in 1915 that was mainly pro KKK and anti Black.The film is based on the book by Ron Stallworth, the true story of his becoming the \"Jackie Robinson\" of the Colorado Springs police department, the first African-American to join the department. He will eventually goes undercover, passing as white via telephone, in the local KKK and soon talking to David Duke, their Grand Wizard. The next step is to have white, Jewish detective Flip Zimmerman be Ron at meetings he is invited to attend.From that point on practically every group of people from Blacks to White Christian Americas to Gays to Jews, Policemen, 'Pigs\", among others, with all the negative and positive words, sayings associated with each. It is here where the script, and Lee, go helter-skelter with words, music, fashions, ideas and portraying various people who were involved for and against the KKK. Though the mid-section is scattered all over it is easy enough to follow and gives you the time to hear the ideas and arguments.It is at this point that Harry Belafonte appears on screen and starts talking to a group of Black Student Union members and about the 1916 lynching of Jesse Washington in Texas with inter-cutting scenes of David Duke giving a speech about 'white men' that you forget to breath until the final shot before the credits appear.This past weekend was the anniversary of the white supremacists march and violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, and Spike Lee drives home what has happened since then.The cast from John David Washington as Ron, Adam Driver as his partner, Laura Harrier as a local collage activist leader, Topher Grace as David Duke, Corey Hawkins as Carmichael aka Kwame Ture then, Robert John Burke as the police chief, along with strong actors as part of the squad or the KKK. Last but not least there is the face of Harry Belafonte who was a symbol to many of the Black people fighting for equality and dignity.\"BLACKkKLANSMAN\" is a film with laughs, horror, truth, being clear and confused within the same frame, heroics, pain, moving and a major accomplishment in the career of Spike Lee."

Remember: They had a good life.BlacKkKlansman is all that but it's also a true story about the shadow and eternal stain of cultural and institutional racism in the United States. Spike Lee takes a case from real life to expose an idealogy of the past that today in this 2018 regrettably has become more palpable than ever.Perhaps the most ironic is how he mixes such a serious subject and balances it with enough sobriety and a good dose of drama and comedy when necessary. But that's true to his style as a director, so it's not surprising but it's pretty good to see him once again doing things really well.I would like to delve more about the film but I firmly believe that it's not necessary but I think that each viewer should see it and get the best out of it in the end to be able to express an opinion and take a teaching on its subject today more than ever.It's assumed that the US is the most progressive and open country in the world or perhaps one of them. Do you seriously want to go back to that past? When a few, had a good life because of the color of their skin?Enough to think about it."

      "text": "the way it is crafted out..BlacKkKlansmanBlacKkKlansman is a character driven thriller drama depicting the dark times that striked upon American Civil Rights which was steeped by an organization named Ku Klax Klan. Fortunately, for the makers the taboo subject analyzed in here hits the required note upon the current political situation. The vision of the writers is ahead of its time and with a jagged script like such, they don't flinch on visiting newer territories. Despite of meddling with such a fragile concept, the feature is surprisingly hilarious with tiny notions of the theories and references of cinema and music of 70's that is imputed smoothly. The usual chain terminology in your typical Police Headquarters is depicted aptly with a light environment among the office employees in order to bridge their bonding with concrete material. The husbandry gags kicks in especially when Driver learns to adapt the dialect and tone of Washington with some tricks and tactics that draws in most of the laughs. Ticking for more than two hours, the screenplay is tightly packed in two halfs. The first one is how Driver spears into their world of habitual controversies and \"be part of the gang\". While the other half is basically nail-biting \"close calls\" where Lee's directorial experience and finesse factors in effectively. The writing is elaborative with bold and inedible substance that aren't minced in words and if anything the emotions iterated by them is pure rage, to a point where audience may easily cringe on the seat to the \"whiteness\" of reality. Lee's tale is of Mob mentality that he speaks in volume through metaphorical terms foliated in long monologues and speeches that are exhilarating as much as layered. The political narrative is never opinionated since it explores both the side of the coin and tosses in front of the viewer to calculate upon. The music plays a vital role in Lee's latest project, the background score is appealing with up beating and heart breaking songs that elevates the momentum of the sequence. Washington's character is under sheer pressure at most of the time as it fights on both the aspects of the issues depicted in here but his portrayal is sculpted with such panache that it makes you groove when he hits someone or scores in an argument or even moves his legs in clubs. While his better half on screen, Driver recieves a bit more intense role (he still gets few laughs now and then with his partners) as he plays more on the field than behind the desk. Jasper Paakkonen gets a stand out moment and is probably Lee's finest Trump card, for he is not only the threat to everyone in the feature but he gets equally wider range as the protagonist does. Harrier, Grace and Burke holds on to their roles tightly and delivers a decent performance. As mentioned earlier, Lee is no short on execution and is probably his best work of his career as he has evolved naturally on delivering a compelling storytelling. The gripping screenplay, debates hidden under ideology and conversations and Washington and Driver's on screen chemistry are the high points of the feature. BlacKkKlansman is the finest entries on Cannes festival this year and is a competitive contender to the Golden Trophy and not because of its questions raised in here for the current society but the way it is crafted out."

When they decide to infiltrate the organization, a fellow officer and a Jew (Adam Driver) is enlisted to take assume his role in person. This narrative is told with tension and humor, but the movie also takes several extended preachy moments to hammer home the history of racism in America.

      "text": "Kidding? I\u2019m not right now. Racial tensions are still as horrific as ever, it now seems every month there is a new film made to empower Black people while exploring those unjustified relations between them and White people. So appropriately enough, filmmaking legend Spike Lee gives us BlacKkKlansman to explore those very relations in a time when White cops kill innocent Blacks like dogs. Even when history books have records of the \u201cBlack Panther Party\u201d threatening the United States back in the 1970s, the message is clear: We need to stop and learn from our historical darkness.Kicking the can more, this film has a humorous plot scenario pulled straight out of real life: a Black guy applies to be a cop, leading him to work undercover. Essentially, he pretends to be White on the phone as he speaks to the leaders of a secret Ku Klux Klan organization, leading to that undercover investigation where his White partner pretends to be him. Beyond the mere ironic comedy, this Klan\u2019s planned massacre of Blacks becomes quite disturbing as they are seen praying to God, complete with an oil anointment before they do their cross burning. This new Boston Tea Party as they call it is all a part of their plan to make America achieve its greatness again\u2026 because apparently they made America and must keep it for themselves. That mindset is visualized by a stain glass window with the words \u201cThine O Lord is the Victory\u201d behind those who think they understand God\u2019s will, but truly have the knowledge of a snowflake.Key here may be Spike Lee\u2019s history of exploring Blackness in America, but he\u2019s trying way too hard to connect the early 1970s to today. That especially goes this movie\u2019s historical inaccuracy, \u201cStallworth's real colleague wasn't called Flip Zimmerman - his true identity remains a mystery, in accounts known only as Chuck - and there's no indication that he was Jewish.\u201d (ScreenRant) At least the expert acting is easy to like, as nobody ever tarries in their performances, always racing on their palms to let the true soul of Blackness come out. Yet I most want to commend how Paul Walter Hauser particularly confronts his role well as a Klansman damaged beyond repair, like he\u2019s half-a-man dragged down onto the cement pavement.Klans such as this one will certainly give anyone watching strong opinions, just don\u2019t expect that to mean the character arcs will be the thing to suck you in to this film\u2019s humanity. While effective, the main romantic subplot was unnecessary in influencing the protagonist or reconnecting him much with Black culture. His partners in crime also don\u2019t seem influenced much by being involved with the Klan during their undercover case. Those Klansmen they bamboozle likewise are not multidimensional enough with clear fears written down on paper.Kennedy would not have wanted to see this type of future after being assassinated in his Ford, but it happened, as the sincere nature of this film is kept through an inspirational speech at the Black Student Union of Colorado College. This whole scene helps you to listen, then the script hops right back onto its tongue-in-cheek humor, including how Blacks pronouncing \u201care\u201d as \u201care-uh\u201d puts a halt in our understanding. Then topping all the memorable lines off in the cleverly detailed dialogue is an awesome phone call that speaks fluent Jive, a very lively form of English! But the artistic language rich with racial segregation sadly is not helped by the handheld camera that could very well been supported by a gorilla.King Kong may have had a bit of word to say in the editing and cinematography, but that\u2019s not what will affect you the most while watching\u2026 it will be the realism. You\u2019ll feel disturbed to see this KKK\u2019s gunfire practice use targets of running black silhouettes in the autumn forest, but not nearly as much so as when these events connect straight to The Birth of a Nation, which the Klan reacts to with thunderous applause. Overall, the right perspectives are told from Ron Stallworth\u2019s autobiography that will live on once he\u2019s nothing more than a casket and bones.Really though, while it means well, BlacKkKlansman paints an unintentionally immoral portrait of Spike Lee\u2019s ideal America where any motivation by God is just a fuel for racism. Apparently, it\u2019s all about humanism, but the Klan proves that we should not rely on ourselves, as its unnecessarily preachy final sequence proves: a series of modern day news footage showing the destruction caused by Black Lives Matter, not secretive about hatred towards our president. On top of that, this movie claims to be \u201cbased on some fo' real, fo' real sh*t\" except it\u2019s not, plenty of it is made up. So, with that put, this film\u2019s message of relying on ourselves contradicts itself in a way. Likewise, you\u2019d be better off living today for love, not rebellion, with the capacity to work of a donkey and the wise strength of an elephant."

My only complaint is one scene near the end of the movie is not believable and irrelevant.  Besides that, this the film is near perfection. I do see people's complaints about the film's connection between the current President and white supremacists.  Unfortunately, the President's slogan \"America First\" was a KKK slogan and the President's response to Charlottesville, to say the least, was embarrassing and weak."

      "text": "\"Blackkklansman\" is possibly the year's best, but it does have some serious competition with \"Hereditary\", one of the creepiest and mind melting movies to come down the horror pike in years.    John David Washington turns in a spectacular performance as undercover cop Ron Stallworth, a true story of a very smart and brave African-American who is the first to join the Colorado Springs police department.    After hearing a moving speech by the former Stokely Carmichael as an undercover cop assigned to listen for possible threats against the citizens of the city, he becomes sufficiently moved enough to  cook up an under cover operation against the local KKK chapter.    To do so he has to use his detective white friend Flip Zimmerman, played brilliantly by Adam Driver to be his in the flesh double at various meetings and infiltrate and eventually become a full member of the KKK, with the Grand Wizard David Duke coming to Colorado Springs to personally swear him in.    It's much more than that, however, as both versions of Stallworth have to be oh so careful in their roles.    The big takeaway from this movie is of course the demonstration of the ultra hate filled and impenetrable stupidity and mental psychosis that defines all those involved with this hideous organization.    That it goes for all hate groups, including skin heads and other \"organizations\" that exist today as well is an obvious point.    Lee, however, has done a great job of pointing out several factors that can be overlooked in this day and age of focus on extremist positions.    First, while the KKK members and equally hate filled idiotic spouses are pictured for the tyrants they are, we are reminded that there are plenty - millions - of white people out there who deplore these racist hate mongers as much as any African American does.    It's very important to mention this because if we are ever to wipe out or minimalize for good the actions of hate groups and do something about those elected to office who are racists themselves it will take a concerted effort of cooperation between all races, creeds, religions, etc. to achieve the goals of at least reducing the insipid behavior of those who support white supremacy and other horrible agendas.    The film closes with actual footage of the demonstrations in Charlottesville, Virginia by racist morons, including that of the murderer who deliberately ran over a woman with his car for being \"liberal\" and supporting the black counter demonstrators.    Add that incredibly stupid statement by Trump accusing both \"sides\" of terrible behavior, when it was a demonstration by white power numbskulls that took place.    Why would it be terrible for those who were being attacked to defend themselves?    All it did was strengthen the bonds of the racist morons to Trump, who is a profound racist as we all know.    I truly believe that the movie is great, and as a white male, I feel it important to let those minorities who are oppressed, including the LGBT community and all who suffer at the hands of hate filled bigots that there are millions of us out there who are in total support of you and are just as disgusted and fed up with these mental midgets as you are.    I hope the movie gives us a feeling of cooperation and a desire to close the horrendous social/political divide that is killing this country.    It can be done, especially at the voting booth.    We must show the haters who love Trump and his own hatred that their kind cannot prevail for long.    They belong in the sewers where they crawled out of when Trump announced his candidacy."

Far distant from his greatest moments like Do The Right Thing, Clockers or Inside Man, this movie is nothing more than political pyromania and hysterical activism that blantly decontextualizes footage from D.W. Griffith' Birth of a Nation for pure demagogic reasons. Lots of cliches and a militant overexcitation which is expressed in a misplaced way instead of shaping and transmitting naturally the story. Paltry movie, with a redudant and simplistic vision only to continue at full steam the 'agitprop' which is intoxicating USA."

      "text": "Ladies and gentlemen, the reviews do not lie - director Spike Lee has crafted what is perhaps his most compelling film in well over a decade with \"BlackKklansman\", a movie that is as smart and funny as it is politically aware and relevant in the current heated climate.The film does get off to a slow start, but when it does take off it does so like a rocket. The main plot - a black police officer joins the KKK and has a white coworker pretend to be him at their meetings in order to investigate and disrupt their operations - is one so ridiculous that it would require every person working on the movie to be firing on all cylinders, and Lee, the screenwriters and the talented cast pull it off without a hitch. Part of why this works as well as it does is because the lunacy of the premise is like an in-joke that the characters are in on, and watching them go back-and-forth between stone-faced seriousness when face-to-face with the Klan and outright mocking behind their backs for having fooled them so completely is thoroughly entertaining to watch. The two leads give fine performances - Adam Driver's was my personal favorite between him and John David Washington, because he does a lot to explore the moral grey zone of a Jewish cop going undercover and spouting hatred left and right and is thus ten times more compelling here than in either of the more recent \"Star Wars\" movies - and the movie proves it has more on its mind than a zany premise and some comic hijinks, with juxtaposed images of young black college students and ordinary-looking white people chanting \"Black/White Power\", respectively, bringing up some interesting comparisons and contrasts while the side plot of Washington's character dating the president of the Black Student Union at the local college allows for thought-provoking conversations between the two on whether black people can try to fix the system from within by gaining access to it or it should be torn down for being too far gone to save.The movie does get a bit heavy-handed in some places, the insane amounts of racist rhetoric are to be taken with caution if you react strongly to that sort of thing, and as mentioned before the first 20-30 minutes are a bit of a drag, but on the whole this is a compelling and insightful film from one of our most overtly political filmmakers working today. Regardless of where you sit on the political spectrum, you owe it to yourself to get out and see this movie - it may not change anyone's opinion, but it'll certainly provoke some thought at the very least."
