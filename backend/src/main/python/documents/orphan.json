Be sure to use the restrooms before the start of the movie, as it is very riveting and suspenseful. Except for one sex scene between the husband and wife, this film can be viewed by mature children accompanied by an adult. It is very well written, and well-balanced. Personally I found this film very entertaining, suspenseful, and the plot cleverly written. Without getting into too much detail and ruining it for everyone else, this movie is in a category in which the story could become true in the future. Isabel Furhman did a great job starring as an orphan adopted by a couple who was looking to fill a void in the family due to an earlier tragedy. Her ability to manipulate her siblings as well as her adoptive father, thoroughly frustrates the mother. As the movie progresses, her manipulative abilities become more apparent and deadly.

I'll never understand others from the audience usually enjoying snacks when sitting and watching films like 'Orphan'. Isabelle is brilliant but too exposed in her character role, and yes, like many say - you immediately dislike her... not necessarily because of her stereotypical child-like princess charms, but simply because people like this (whether kids or adults) when insisting on being adored and 'your best friends' have a disturbing side to their persona... Amazing how obviously wrong something about Esther is, while naive loving couple oversees the girl's overarticulatedness as something of a virtue. I like the idea of exposing how sinister a manipulator a child can be - confronting adults in their ever-present sense of affection no matter how extreme child's actions might get.

Orphan is a new take on an old horror genre - the evil child movie.  But the twist at the end is probably what makes the movie even more disturbing when you watch the movie again.  The bits of dialogue in the film, while not particularly memorable, seem to have a more sinister take in the second viewing.  The acting in the film was especially good.  Isabelle Fuhrman's acting was particularly notable without saying, but it would be folly to overlook the convincing performances of the rest of the cast.  The story itself was good at it's core, but it fell flat at major points, such as pacing and introducing character development at wrong moments.  The latter part of that sentence is especially important, as it seemed that the filmmakers wanted to introduce new flaws in the protagonist to excuse the actions of the antagonist late in the film.  On another note, the movie worked too hard to have a disruptive character (the Orphan) integrate into a disrupted family, almost as if she had some sort of hand in the problems that plagued the family before showing up to wreak havoc.  In a horror movie, one-dimensional characters aren't a problem, but when there's too much depth to potential victims you have trouble following.  Lastly, as mentioned before, the pacing of the film poor and slow.  For some reason, \"Suspense\" was defined as utilizing camera shots and cheap jump shots to establish an atmosphere of \"on edge\" horror.  While it might work for some films, I can't understand why it was used throughout this entire movie, particularly when the antagonist hasn't even shown up.  It began to get old and predictable to a point that when the real horror began, you could tell that the filmmakers weren't even that interested in it anymore.  The film gets this rating for trying to be original and bringing in a strong troupe of performers who did well with what they had to work with.

ORPHAN was a big hit upon its release in 2009, despite its many setbacks that keep it from becoming a classic in the killer kids genre. The character of Esther is written and played far too menacingly for her to remain unnoticed. There is no ambiguity in her actions, as she is clearly portrayed as being evil from the very start. As a result, much of the film relies on the shock of her actions rather than the build up or suspense leading up to them. It does, however, manage to maintain the mystery behind her shady background long enough to give the audience one final surprise! Esther's adopted parents are easily the most frustrating parents in recent Horror. Her crackpot mother is irritating and irresponsible, while her idiot father stands completely oblivious to her evil ways in light of the horrible tragedies that are affecting his family. They gain no sympathy or support as a result.
