If you're expecting high art, you won't find it here. But it's a good time with laughs and a good bit of innovative violence. It's great seeing some alumni from The Unit and Human Target in the mix - two great testosterone-fueled shows whose plugs were pulled before their respective times. Saldana does a perfectly respectable job in her role. Physically, she's spot on. She could have brought a bit more emotional range to the proceedings, but again, it's a B movie action flick.  Nailed it."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "The stupidity of this movie isn't what make it bad. The fact that it actually think its smart, is what makes this movie so dismal. Sitting through it was a difficult experience, not even Saldana's beauty and effort could save it. In fact it only makes it more difficult to watch as she's wasting talent on a movie that should have been made for tv. Colombiana is a cliched-ridden mess, with poor dialogue that would make the best of actors look horrible. The movie crumbles as the story progresses, and its surely one of the summer's loudest light-weights."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "I wanted to like this movie.  Zoe Saldana is gorgeous and very capable in an action movie.  For some reason, though, she keeps picking lousy screenplays (like The Losers, which was also not good).  Columbiana is well shot and looks great.  The pacing is fine.  But this screenplay is so corny and full of insipid plot holes and logical leaps that is strains credulity.  The director is very adept in filming the action scenes and makes good use of the various locations.  But you can't get past the stupid script, unless you just don't care how stupid it is.  While one must be able to suspend disbelief to go with a number of movies, some movies just push that envelope so badly that it does not work.  Luc Besson's heavy handed mitts are clumsily all over this formulaic, corny and predictable story with cliche-ridden villains, which is a shame.  Zoe Saldana is almost worth the price of admission, but this would have been better if it were a female \"Bourne\" or her being the next Lara Croft.  As it is this is a pretty movie with a stunning star that is just terrible."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Restraint isn't a word that you'd normally associate with filmmaker Quentin Tarantino, especially in \"Kill Bill: Vol. 1\", the Grand Guignol revenge spectacle, starring Uma Thurman as The Bride, the be-all and end-all of female vigilantes, who keeps killing until there's nobody left to kill. Despite the high body count, the film does have a moral center as it pertains to children, unlike cross-generational films such as John Carpenter's \"Assault on Precinct 13\"(where during the infamous ice cream truck sequence, a little girl is graphically shot in the chest), and the recent \"Kick-Ass\", featuring Chloe Moretz, who as Hit Girl, similar to young Cataleya in \"Colombiana\", seems way too wise beyond her years, in regard to violence. In retrospect, Tarantino has his limits. Vernita, a.k.a. \"Copperhead\", allows her daughter Nikki to have a childhood(in \"Kill Bill: Vol. 2\", Bill turns out to be a surprisingly good parent, too), and in return, The Bride allows the girl to live, even though a double homicide would have been cleaner. Nikki acts like how a little girl should, when confronted with the sight of some strange woman removing a knife from her mother's chest. She does nothing. A recent slate of films(in addition to \"Kick-Ass\", there is also Joe Wright's \"Hanna\" and Jaume Collet-Serra's \"Orphan) makes it seem completely natural that a child should stab or shoot like a pro. Tarantino understands that Nikki is too young for murder; too unformed for vengeance, so she just stands there, shellshocked, as The Bride wipes the blood off from her blade. In \"Colombiana\", however, taking its cues from those aforementioned movies, in which kids commit violent acts with a disproportionate amount of competence, and more disturbingly, with steely resolve, Cataleya pins the hand of a drug lord's henchman to the table, and declares her intention \"to kill Don Luis,\" only moments after a hit squad orphans the girl, as if maiming a grown man, then escaping through an open window, and scaling down a building, followed by her outrunning a pack of angry Colombians through a shanty town, is par for the course, despite being nine. To put her exploits in perspective, Paul Kersey(Charles Bronson), perhaps, the most famous vigilante of them all, whose actions in the \"Death Wish\" movies inspired real-life copycats, is downright tentative in responding to the home invaders that destroys his family. The ease in which Cataleya handles a knife becomes a contextual indicator of violence in regard to its cultural evolution from being a man's business to mere kid's play, since Bronson's first weapon isn't a gun, but a sock filled with quarters, twenty dollars worth, which he acquires from the bank, in lieu of procuring a real weapon from an arms dealer. Ironically, it's the architect who possesses a childish armament, whereas Cataleya, upon arriving in the states, announces to her older brother that she wants to be a killer. The girl turns Bronson into Macaulay Culkin; when Paul is home alone, he swings the sock over his head. Emilio tries to deter Cataleya from her plan by shooting over a crowd to no avail. \"Colombiana\" avoids controversy by cutting to Cataleya all grown up, thereby averting the unsettling sight of a homicidal minor. As an adult, Cataleya is played by Zoe Saldana, and because of her skin color, the kneejerk response is to link her to blaxploitation stars such as Pam Grier and Tamara Dobson, since the film itself is being marketed as a sort of black \"Le Femme Nikita\". But where's the camp value? To put it in politically incorrect terms, Cataleya kills like a white woman, a female vigilante more akin to Camille Keaton in \"Day of the Women\", and especially, Christina Lindberg in \"Thriller: A Cruel Picture\"; women with sadism on their minds. For a heroin, the 1973 Bo Arne Vibenius cult classic had a heroin-addled farm girl(made mute by rape), who goes on a killing spree after escaping from a life of sex slavery. Although Madeline's vengeance is justified(she shoots her johns, both male and female), there's no condoning her deviation from the hit list when the one-eyed girl kills two cops, and the innocent motorists she runs off the highway. By the time Madeline gets to Tony, the purity of the girl's mission is all but compromised, due to the pleasure she derives from her use of torture on the pimp. It's the ruination of all vigilantes, the humanity that becomes mislaid as they hazard through their righteous quest, in which the wronged person becomes the very thing he/she hates, a cold-blooded killer. Instead of a horse, Cataleya uses sharks and dogs to do her pernicious bidding. This tag killer(an orchid) is not the little girl who watched her parents get murdered. She becomes an evil that both Emilio and the film itself doesn't seem to grasp. \"Colombiana\" is as desensitized to violence as Cataleya seems to be. It's left to the moviegoer to judge this serial murderer."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "A young Colombian girl watches crime lords kill her parents.

I don't understand what all the fuss is about - I walked into the theater expecting to see a poorly made, crappy movie where all the actors are uttering cheesy one-liners and doing unbelievably stupid stunts that did not add to the plot of the movie - this is what I was led to believe by all of the negative reviews. In fact, I almost did NOT see this movie in the theater at all. Boy, are all of the critics who posted horrible reviews of this movie WRONG, WRONG, WRONG. Columbiana, starring Zoe Saldana as the titular character, is a hotbed of action which steam-rolls through from beginning to end. Incredibly, the killing and other violent activities which form the basis of the movie do not bump the flick up from a PG-13 rating - how they did this, I will never know, because the movie is very, very violent. People talk about the lack of character development in this movie - that is just a big, steaming pile of horse manure. Here's why: As most of you must know by now, the main character and protagonist, Cataleya Restrepo (Amandla Stenberg & Zoe Saldana), is the daughter of a kingpin in the drug trade. When Fabio (Jesse Borrego), Cataleya's father, decides to leave the particular drug cartel he is associated with, the cartel's Don or father, named Don Luis (Beto Benites) orders Fabio and his entire family killed. Fabio discovers the kill-order, and attempts to flee with his wife Alicia (Cynthia Addai-Robinson) and daughter, 10 year old Cataleya - but they are too late. Unfortunately, the parents are killed in an off-screen standoff-cum gun-battle inside their home while Cataleya sits terrified at the kitchen table. She does not see her parents killed, but she knows what has happened. THIS IS ALL THE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT THIS TYPE OF MOVIE NEEDS. The violent murders of Cataleya's parents creates a thirst for vengeance which will not be sated until all parties involved suffer a similar fate. This is the movie's moment of truth: It defines the way the story is treated from that moment forward. Critics have complained that the audience was not shown HOW Cataleya developed her childhood \"parkour\" or speedy obstacle navigation escape skills. That's just silly - first, the child of a drug kingpin in Bogota, Columbia would most likely be taught by her gun-wielding parents SOME type of self defense - which NEED NOT be part of the film's scope - second, any child who plays with other children knows how to run, jump and hide - and third, a terrified child is usually uniquely capable of eluding pursuers for a short period of time if given enough of a head-start. I have also read complaints regarding Cataleya's lack of a personality - that's ridiculous. She is simply a vengeful **** who does not lose focus - ever since escaping, her ultimate goal has been killing those responsible for murdering her family. We even get to see her interact lovingly with her uncle, Emilio Restrepo (Cliff Curtis), her grandmother, Mama (Ofelia Medina), her boyfriend, Danny Delanay (Michael Vartan), her adopted family, and her dogs. The movie is careful to show that while these parts of her personality are important to her, Cataleya cannot truly move forward with her emotional development until she has exacted her revenge. Critics of the movie have complained about silly little cosmetic touches like Zoe wearing a black leotard, Zoe dancing in front of the camera, and Zoe sucking a lollipop. REALLY? Are these the things that make a movie BAD? Get real. The most important aspect of the movie for me is that Cataleya is forced to see that her single-minded focus on vengeance directly causes the remaining members of her family to be murdered. She is also forced to see what she has become when she faces FBI agent Ross (Lennie James) and threatens the lives of his family in order to assure his cooperation. Once this happens, and once Cataleya finally kills the man who ordered her family murdered, she is able to move forward with her development - and her life. The story has a neat, tidy ending, perhaps leaving the audience with a feeling as anticlimactic as Columbiana herself must have felt. Do yourself a favor - do not listen to the critics - see this movie and judge for yourself. Columbiana is a legendary piece of action filmmaking.- Chipper F.

How did she become such a bad ass assassin.? Her uncle sure as hell didn't teach her, although that's what we're lead to believe. But how can I guy that shoots into crowds and by a nearby school teach the art of intelligent killing, when he himself is reckless.2.) Is she a killer for hire? It wasn't clear if she killed people that did bad things and people that were connected to her family's killing or all of her murders were connected?  3.) Middle-Aged thinking. The head FBI investigator that was tracking Cataleya couldn't believe that a woman could be behind all of the killings. How could a person in such power, who obviously got to his position for showing some sort of intelligence, think like a man stuck in the middle ages. This error comes down to bad writing. 4.) How can Cataleya, be such a bad ass assassin yet be so stupid? Cataleya over the years had been killing 22 victims and leaving the Cataleya flower imprinted on their chest. This was a way of scaring the people involved in her parents murder and letting them know she's close to killing them. This in turn has a bad reaction as her uncle and aunt are killed because of this. Her recklessness is the only thing she learned from her uncle, yet when her uncle confronts her about the markings, which he was unaware of, he tries to act like he taught her to be better.

And there are even reversed ones like were the main characters are in one place in the way of others travelling.\r While the reason for the journey is actually not the most important part of the journey, it  is important  enough as it can even have a profound influence due to the state of mind a person is in when the journey starts. Colombiana is a movie where the main protagonist Cataleya  is confronted by the violent deaths of her parents.  Her state of being is one of assumed innocence: as a nine year old child she sits at the kitchen table of her home, dressed in a neath clean black and white school uniform as violence erupts around her. With a inward turned gaze in her big doe brown eyes she faces the main henchman, who walks up to her, sit downs and talks to her. It is almost a Tarantino moment.\r Almost, as it isn't. For Megaton shows himself to be the lesser of directors by ruining it. Had he started out with this moment it might have captured some of the tension and even made the next scene tolerable. The one in which the nine year old drives a knife through the bad guys hand into the table underneath, then runs through the house, jumps through a small window and descends several storeys while being chased by goons emptying their guns at her.\r What young kid could keep her wits to pull off well considered actions after having experienced the mental shock of her parents deaths, those that triggers her screams for revenge? Only  a seriously mentally disturbed one can: a psychopath that has no feelings. So was this presumable innocent child, about to turn into a vengeful assassin, already a cold hearted  murderer to start with? Was she already a natural born killer?\r It would have worked if that had been born out in the next part of the movie. We fastforward fifteen years after Cataleya has found shelter with her uncle and demanded to be turned into an angel of death by him. Apparently he has not only the means to provide her with the necessary skills and equipment, but also the will, as is born out by the ludicrous scene in which he pulls out a gun and shoots at random people and cars on a crossing to make the point that anyone can shoot anyone at random, but you can't get away with it. Which he proceeds to do next as he walks out while the police cars drive past. What message that conveys.\r If the next part of the story would have told the journey of Cataleya's demise as psychopath killer- but what psychopath would require the excuse for killing of deaths that occured 15 years ago- or ascension(or downfall) as a human being struggling to get away from her maimed past, it would have been a better movie. It reminds me of the movie Hannah, where Hannah is trained by her father to be that killer Cataleya's is supposed to be, but while Hannah starts to change when confronted by the interaction with 'normal' humans, Cataleya doesn't: she just has sex with them. For the four 'intimate' moments that she has with her lover has two with mainly sex in them. That is not character development, that is pandering to the male audience.\r Megaton drops the ball twice. For without focusing on Cataleya as a person struggling with what she has become, he has to focus on the mayhem. But this is done is such a haphazard manner that the result is silly. In fact it commits the grievous sin of showing the director at work. For when Cataleya turns a corner and doesn't run into a guard once or twice we might say that is sheer luck but if she does it all the time, including opening and closing grates just in time, fitting through ventilation shafts with ease and opening them without a hitch, this is the script being laid bare. That she can do the impossible is because the director wants her to, not because of luck or skill. And this makes a director a weak one. No good magician, and that is what a director is, shows how his tricks work: it takes the magic away.\r Megaton develops nothing. Cataleya's  journey is rushed. Her targets are indistinct targets she and we could care less about, unlike the ones the Bride kills in Kill Bill, another avenging angel. And her skills are based on sheer luck, impossible powers and the stupidity of her opponents.\r This movie has virtually nothing to show for it, except for one scene, the ones with the sharks, the acting of Saldana and James who do the best they can with a feeble script, and the song at the end:  Hurt by Johnny Cash. But that masterpiece can't save this movie: it only underscores how weak it actually is."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Columbiana had its action, adult themes, and plot, but it wasn't near the standard of a high-quality action movie. Overall, the movie was not bad at all, but definitely not my taste: Unnecessary killing of a tag-killer/assassin with moments of sensitivity and moments of just pure heartlessness isn't very deep at all, in fact, it's on the shallow side of a semi-mainstream action movie."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Colombiana was a film with very good gifts of action, but with a history, performances and regular scenes, the beginning turned out to be very good, but as the film progresses, it moves us back in emotion and that is not favorable, the performance of Zoe Saldana was convincing but not to empathize with her."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Zoe Colombiana Zoe Colombiana Zoe Colombiana Zoe Colombiana Zoe Colombiana Zoe Colombiana Zoe Colombiana Zoe Colombiana Zoe Colombiana Zoe Colombiana Zoe Colombiana Zoe Colombiana Zoe Colombiana Zoe Colombiana Zoe Colombiana Zoe Colombiana Zoe Colombiana Zoe Colombiana Zoe Colombiana Zoe Colombiana Zoe Colombiana Zoe Colombiana Zoe Colombiana Zoe Colombiana Zoe Colombiana Zoe Colombiana Zoe Colombiana Zoe Colombiana Zoe Colombiana Zoe Colombiana Zoe Colombiana Zoe Colombiana Zoe Colombiana Zoe Colombiana Zoe Colombiana Zoe Colombiana"}], "recommendations": ["knock_at_the_cabin", "the_rhythm_section", "unhinged", "the_marksman", "those_who_wish_me_dead", "law_abiding_citizen", "the_purge_anarchy", "taken", "olympus_has_fallen", "no_escape", "breaking_in", "siberia", "the_purge", "3_days_to_kill", "cold_pursuit", "revenge", "the_clovehitch_killer", "sas_red_notice", "savages", "machete", "28_weeks_later", "walking_tall", "i_spit_on_your_grave", "peppermint", "white_house_down"]}
