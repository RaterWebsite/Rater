Puis arrive le train... et le traintrain d'un film qui tout-\u00e0-coup tel un vieux tortillard n'arrive plus \u00e0 grimper les c\u00f4tes...\u00e7a co\u00efncide avec l'apparition de la poup\u00e9e blonde Eva Marie Saint... et m\u00eame si elle incarnait le retour de la madone en personne, elle ne peut certainement pas remplacer l'autre \u00e9g\u00e9rie blonde de Hitchcock, pleine de gr\u00e2ce, Grace Kelly. On me dira cependant que m\u00eame Grace n'aurait pas pu effacer l'ennui d'un coup de baguette magique et on aura raison. Mais tout de m\u00eame.Voici donc que le film s'\u00e9poumone \u00e0 tous les niveaux et p\u00e9dale comme un hamster asthmatique : les dialogues deviennent aussi b\u00eates qu'interminables et le sc\u00e9nario en chute libre d\u00e9voile son vrai visage de s\u00e9rie B, \u00e9crit \u00e0 la va-comme-je-te-pousse, de plus en plus t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 l'avance... M\u00eame l'inqui\u00e9tant personnage de l'excellent James Mason ne parvient pas non plus \u00e0 ressortir le film de son marasme...La fin enfonce le clou et sombre dans le burlesque hollywoodien le plus \u00e9chevel\u00e9 et invraisemblable... Certes, la musique pleine d'entrain de Bernard Herrmann tente de r\u00e9veiller r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement tout \u00e7a. Une musique de bien meilleure qualit\u00e9 que l'ensemble du film, assur\u00e9ment !"

      "text": "Hitchcock's risky and briskly adventure is the apt catalyst to this complex espionage thrillerNorth By NorthwestHitchcock's risky and briskly adventure is the apt catalyst to this complex espionage thriller. As much as simply enthralling its first half is, that follows a linear singular path collecting its plot points like a reward the film moves with ferocious pace and nail biting close calls. But the second half is the one with the real meat. Its complex and at times overstuffed characters with their own agendas and schemes does work since the man behind the camera is Hitchcock. He never lets the content go damp which often happens in such husky script. There is a sense of similarity in here to Polanski's Chinatown, starring Nicholson. And similar to it, the uncertainty is the key to its success.The makers are consistently revealing cards in order to keep the audience tangled in the whirls of these flips and turns that can be difficult to swallow. It is a mature script that always chooses over leaving the room with a cutthroat message rather than an explosion. The euphoric energy of the ping pong that the writers play of who is with whom theories, with Hitchcock's sharp execution it never wears off. Also, there is real ruggedness in here, the characters have the range to look elegant and also pull out the most sinister deed of all.Grant as the real victim proving his innocence isn't always in his A game, his performance isn't persistent in its tone. But what saves the day is both Saint's performance and her character, her alluring suave nature and guns blazing unflinchingly puts her on top of the list. Armed with a smart and meticulous adaptation, Hitchcock takes his time, he is milking out the best from each moment. North By Northwest is less Hitchcock-ish than usual, and it is certainly refreshing."

Its definitely more on the comedic side than most of Hitchcock's work, including some great dialogue, a hilarious auction scene and my soft spot for unwilling protagonists. Add a couple of the most thrilling and iconic sequences in cinema at the middle and end of the film respectively and I'd say its a solid 9/10.Viewed 25/05/2018"

      "text": "My favourite director, Alfred Hitchcock has directed many classics like Psycho, Rear Window and Vertigo, and I will say that this deserves to be up there among his best. I absolutely loved it! The best aspect of this movie is the always charming Cary Grant in a brooding and entertaining performance as Roger Thornhill, a man wanted for the murder of a diplomat. Solidly supporting him all the way are the lovely Eva Marie Saint as Eve Kendell and oily James Mason as the villainous Vandamme. They are further advantaged by some excellent camera-work and a wonderfully atmospheric music score. The script is focused and suspenseful, and Hitchcock's direction ensures the film rarely slips, even if some of the complicated plot does fly over people's heads. The climax though is simply the icing on the cake. Overall, a hugely enjoyable film, which I will give a 9.5/10. Bethany Cox"

      "text": "North by Northwest is one of the first spy thrillers. North by Northwest is the protector of the genre, appeared before the first part about agent 007. The whole film is built on nervous suspense, which is difficult to see in modern films of the genre. The disadvantages include only a long chronometer, due to which the dynamics of the narrative in the second half of the film subsides and the fact that the film was shot mainly in pavilions, and not in wildlife."

      "text": "Another excellent film by Alfred Hitchcock.Personally, this is not one of my favorite Alfred Hitchcock films, although it is one of the most acclaimed and one of the most interesting. The script revolves around a confusion of identities, where an ordinary citizen is mistaken for a spy and ends up in a tremendous confusion with gigantic repercussions on his personal life and national security.The script is quite good and the story has no dead moments. It entertains the audience in a perfect way until the end and makes us curious to know what is really going on, curiosity being an important part of what keeps us stuck in the film (and one of the reasons I prefer to hardly talk about the plot). The main character, played by Cary Grant, was so well thought out that we quickly established an affective and sympathetic link with her, caring about what will happen to her. It goes without saying that, although the cast is very good, it is really Cary Grant who stands out here. Eva Marie Saint is good, but she never leaves the shadow of the male protagonist. Another actor that deserves a positive note is Martin Landau.Technically, it is an impeccable film, to the taste of director Hitchcock. It is full of symbolic scenes or with more than one meaning, some of them bordering on the dreamlike. Some of the scenes are truly striking, like those that were shot on Mount Rushmore. The camera and film work is excellent and cinematography perfectly harmonizes color, light, shadow and contrast, resulting in a visually elegant film, although with the characteristics of a film of its time, of course. The soundtrack is also quite good, as are the sets and costumes."

      "text": "This is a film with a fairly slow moving plot but its nevertheless quite intriguing. There's a definite sense of mystery present. There's the female character, Eve, who all but swoons for the main character, Roger Thornhill (its relatively cheesy at times, I think its fair to say) but of course its hardly a new film. I quite liked that what was really going on wasn't made clear from the get go - seeing things through Roger's eyes was quite intriguing. I could certainly understand his frustration, given the situations he found himself in. I liked that there had clearly been some thought put into the script and there were some instances of amusing and sharp-witted dialogue, such as when a ticket seller at a train starion asks if there's something wrong with his eyes (he's wearing sunglasses to conceal who he is) and he replies 'their sensitive to questions'.This film features a decent cast with Cary Grant as Roger and James Mason as Phillip Vandamm, among others. Plus there's the usual Hitchcock cameo at the very start of the film. If your a fan of mystery thrillers and/or Hitchcock films then yes, I would certainly recommend it."
