Ashton Kutchner was great, we see him in a whole different light, you see a side of him you haven't before. Evan spends his whole life trying to make things right for everyone else around him. He loses and gains and hurts for those around him. He is so busy trying to make things right for everyone else and he never thinks soley on himself. He loves Callie and wants more than anything to be with her, but he wants her to be safe and never go through all she went through in her other lives. He gives up the love he holds so dear to protect her. He's absolutely precious in this movie. He seems very real in the movie and thats one thing that makes it so touching. He does an outstanding job and i would definitely recommend this movie to anyone. By the end you are wanting so much for him to find some kind of peace. Some kind of happiness. All the characters were greatly done, you could relate or dislike many and even sympathize with them as well. It was a great cast and a great movie!"

The child actors in the flashbacks were amazingly real, especially Tommy, who was completely disturbing. The adult actors, from the excellent Amy Smart to the surprisingly convincing Ashton Kutcher, all deliver great performances. The plot of this movie...yeah, it's completely unbelievable, but I don't think it was meant to be believable. The reason for the time travel occuring is never even explained. But the movie manages to draw you in anyway. This was one hell of a movie. I thought the ending was well done, and even a little sad. The beginning was excellently done, the middle...although the whole wheelchair scenario easily could have been cut with no consequence to the story, the rest of the movie flows perfectly. Overall, this movie was a big surprise, and I'm glad it managed to find success at the box office and on DVD. I highly recommend it."

And the reason he suffered from memory loss is because the future-him travelled back to the past-him's body. So imagine the original case: he grows up without memory loss, then he has no reason to write diaries, therefore he won't be able to time travel and cause himself a memory loss."

      "text": "The movie starts off with all the events leading up to the main character Evan\u2019s discovery that he can travel through time. At first, it was okay. It was pretty average, but not too unremarkable. Then it kept switching between different scenes and I started getting a bit confused. \u201cDid the movie mean for it to seem random and sudden, or is it really just that bad?\u201d After the meeting with Evan\u2019s father and the scene where Tommy loses it at the cinema, I was laughing at how ridiculous and exaggerated the events were and how they just rushed those events by without ever stopping to think about how that\u2019d affect anything. The interesting parts start when Evan reads journal entries he wrote when he was younger, and discovers that by reading them, he can travel back in time to when these blackouts occurred. That was fine, though it could have been better. The writing could have been more imaginative. Why is it that every time Evan saves Lenny, Lenny ends up as his roomate? Why is it that every time Evan saves Kayleigh, she ends up with him? Why is it that every time Evan saves Tommy, he ends up a nice religious guy? How could Evan\u2019s empty threats stop Kayleigh and Tommy\u2019s father from being a pedophile and abuser? Why didn\u2019t Evan get charged with self defense in the first place? The movie tries to make their characters seem real and deep or whatever, but the script changes too fast and provides way too much mood whiplash that it ends up being confusing and frustrating. This contradictory writing is a great source of unintentional hilarity.The ending of the movie is something I can appreciate. It was probably the most well-written part in the entire movie, and certainly the only part I can\u2019t find any glaring or aggravating problems about.All in all, the most I\u2019d give this movie a 6/10. The hilarious way it goes about trying to be dramatic and meaningful keeps the movie from being unremarkable, but it\u2019s still not simething I\u2019d watch again nor recommend to others."

What if there's an alternate life for you somewhere, out there, where the cumulative sum of your choices leads to a better reality, a happier and more fulfilling existence? On the flip-side - what if, at the end of the day, you really can't achieve a solid grip on these things, no matter how hard you try?A great deal of science fiction works of art have tried to approach these meaningful questions throughout the years, all presenting many philosophical ideas and notions as to how one man can change his own fate, for better or for worse. In this surprisingly good sci-fi adventure from 2004, directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber (who are also behind the screenplay of Final Destination 2) raise all these questions once again, but use a different angle this time around. Time travel is not the issue here. Instead, our lead protagonist, Evan Treborn (portrayed by Hollywood prankster Ashton Kutcher \u0096 but more on that later) leads his whole life up until his early 20's without knowing he has a rare medical condition that seemingly helps him shut away traumatic incidents that occurred throughout his childhood and adolescence years. All he remembers from these various occasions are bizarre blackouts. But when a blast from his past comes back into his life only to leave it ever so tragically (Kayleigh Miller, portrayed by the lovely Amy Smart who we've since seen in films such as Just Friends and Crank), Evan learns that he can return to those important lost moments in his life and re-inhabit his younger body, thus changing the present and future. However, with every shift in the past comes an alternate present that may seem better at first, but is in fact a far harsher reality than the original one Evan has left.What truly touched me about this film was the essence in which it captured the troublesome youth of my generation, that was born in the 1980's, grew up in the 1990's, and is ever since trying to adapt to the ever changing reality in which we all live in. Here, one man tries to alter all this, and his own personal journey is parallel in many ways to the journey many young people go through nowadays. Part of capturing this Generation X notion is the pop-culture presented throughout the film. When you see the young actors and actress fall in love, fight, and grow up real fast, it all happens amidst references to films of the period (Se7en, etc.), outfits, 1980's technology and other devices that fill you up with an overwhelming feeling of nostalgia and sentiment, as if you were there yourself, living these events and going through all these horrible/wonderful events.Above all things, the makers of The Butterfly Effect do the unbelievable and turn Ashton Kutcher into a good actor \u0096 a feat I thought was unachievable at best. However, in this sci-fi epic it appears as though anything is possible. Bottom line, it was a fresh breath of air when I saw it, left me pondering for days, and gave me the inspiration and write something myself after a long period of writers block. If a film manages to be this inspirational and keep you on the edge of your seat throughout its 113 minutes."

If anything the film is simply too effective. Literally showing the world's worst childhood. It is so much of a downer with child molestation, baby killing and burning puppies that it's almost a Stephen King parody. I guess there is a reason we repress memories after all. I would repress that childhood as well.\r The film to that point kind of reminded me of Sleepers where it was so unpleasant it didn't matter how good the movie is. It's certainly nothing I would ever want to see again. Then the movie takes a wild turn as Ashton Kutcher shows up. As easy a target as he is I hate to admit the second two-thirds of the film are really not his fault.\r Some notes to writer/directors Eric Briss and J. Mackye Gruber. If your going to have scenes in a prison you might want to visit one first, or at least watch a documentary on the same. Speaking of documentaries \"Revenge of the Nerds\" and other eighties comedies are not a documentaries on college life. Sororities do not resemble the Playboy Mansion. And twenty-three year old crack whores often look bad but they tend not to resemble a Dawn of the Dead extra.\r If The Butterfly Effect didn't keep flashing back to the puppy and baby horrors, then the second two thirds would be a hoot. There is even a \"hey there is a psycho chasing me lets take a walk in the dark woods\" scene.\r Since Kutcher's time travel effects only his friends and family and nothing else at all. The Butterfly Effect inadvertently substantiates the reverse of the Butterfly theorem.\r Needless to say the change in tone from the childhood scenes and adult scenes is jarring. Though most of the humor in the adult scenes is admittedly unintentional. Kutcher travels back in time by staring at notebook paper. I tried the same technique staring at my screen. It didn't work I still lost two hours."

Performances by the stars are good enough and the emotionally engaging story arc makes up for any acting shortcomings.  Similar to other user sentiments, I am surprised at how the critics almost unanimously panned this film.  While it is not Oscar-worthy, this film is a solid 8 out of 10.  Viewers will not regret taking two hours to watch this one."

Kutcher acted really well, the story was interesting and intrguing and for me the only downer is the ending. It's not that typical \"happy ending\" you'd want in this kind of movie but it did it's job. Great acting, great story: great movie."

Gets right to the point and the screenplay has things i couldn't even imaging they are so terrible, but they are brilliant events.  I want to give it a 10 because poor acting except for  some good scenes between Amy Smart and Ashton, so i deduct a point there."

Could it have a different ending? Don't really know about that.\r9/10"

I thought that there would be a point were the film was biting off more than it could chew but in the end I thought the film was the best that could be. Ashton Kutcher shows some acting ability in this film and I would really like to see him do more drama because I think this is an underrated role. Amy Smart also shows great versatility by playing so many different characters in the film."

I saw the third ending were he kills himself which I found more meaningful but unnecessary, though the others were weaker they just made more sense"

      "text": "This film contains so much unnecessarily creepy imagery and abhorrent characters that one is forced to treat it as camp, lest the viewer become abysmally unhappy with the state of the world. That said, the unintentional-comedy potential (even more so with the director's cut \"true\" ending) is fantastic. A true must-see for film viewers with at least a half a sense of irony."

I didn't think the finale ruined the movie and it is a surprise which makes for a twist the movie might not have otherwise had.\r The movie was  actually well thought through on many levels and considering the logic and story that is not an easy thing to accomplish.  I don't think critics like fantasies, which is what this movie is.\r Ultimately the movie is love story with a very strong theme and the conclusion supports that theme perfectly.  In that way the conclusion works very well.\r I don't the critics understand that.  A lot of critics don't understand story."

Honestly I don't know why anyone would get Ashton to be in a film if they wanted the film to be good? I reckon they knew they had a weak script here. Anyway somewhere along the line they manage to get an interesting point about human nature across, but its pretty much smothered by the surrounding crap. Shame really."

The end might not be as convincing as it could be but that don't take away the credit from the director for engaging or rather confusing our mind with such a well built movie."

      "text": "I feel like a lot of critics wrote this movie off because Ashton Kutcher is in it. I've been intrigued by this movie for a few years now but I never got to see it until yesterday. But lets ponder the premise of this film for a second, what if you could go back to major junctions in your life and go down another path? What if there's an alternate existence out there for you? where the cumulative sum of the choices that you didn't make become a better reality with a happier and more fulfilling existence? But at the same time what if the power to change the past and it ended up screwing up your reality for the better? what if the choice you didn't make wasn't the good choice? Do you go back and see the consequences? The story is fairly uncomplicated, presenting events in a chronological order that keeps the viewer's attention and interested. With films like this, there are invariably going to be a ton of plot holes if you think too much about it, but that's part of the charm. The plot features a guy who damaged by the events of his past, then he discovers that he can travel back in time to various times of his life, and the ensuing chaos that arises when he tries to change things in the hopes of making things better for those involved. His sole motivation, from my perspective was to find a way to where he can be with his girl while at the same time changing the events and lives of those he was friends with at the time. The whole point of the movie focuses on the butterfly effect and how little choices send echoes through time and change the events of your life for better or for worse. The whole premise of the film is so well thought out that I'm just baffled on why this film has a paltry 30 on metacritc. Ashton Kutcher, whom I've never been a fan of and have almost despised every movie he's been in, gives a surprising performance that really shows his acting chops. Most of the cast did well also and deserve props for their work in this film. However, in this sci-fi epic it appears as though anything is possible and it left me pondering my own decisions in life with the big \"what if we could go back and do this instead of this?\" question. While I understand that people/critcs may not like it or even understand its premise you have to give it props, in my point of view as film manages to be inspirational and can maybe help you get over your past while at the same time doing a good job at keeping you on the edge of your seat throughout its entirety."
