What emotions we felt, what our minds gravitate too during times of immense stress and emotional pain and what we do to maintain some sort of relationship with sanity. Many films in my opinion have tried to accomplish what Malick has so eloquently scratched the surface of. No other film has threw me back into the grinder like thin red line...i cried for hours after......9.5/10"

The voice overs, the cinematography, the diaglogue, the acting, the tension, the brutality, the brotherhood....and who can forget the music. I could go on and on and on. A unforgettable cinematic masterpiece which gets better with each extra viewing. There can be no higher recommendation for a literary deconstruction on the nature of man and conflict. Quite simply breathtaking."

The context-less death. The meaninglessness of a 'mission' or any moral framework given to industrial murder, what we call war. It might even be necessary at times, but this is one of the few films that isn't a hallmark card to the participants; it's a simulcrum of what they went through, the price of it all. No one who advocates war, especially those that want to beat their chests about the might of this nation, should do so without understanding what this film captures: the price of conflict, the horror of warfare."

This movie much like Homer's The Iliad; the war is used as a setting for Malick to express his views on human nature in times of tribulation. The movie features pairs of corresponding characters. The cynical Sgt. Welch (Penn) corresponds to the optimistic Pvt. Witt (Caviezel). Witt is considered to be the main character, with his tranquility and hope opposing the basic feelings of ordinary soldiers. The soft-spoken and diligent Captain Staros oftens conflicts with the angry, bloodthristy Col. Tall (Nolte), and their confrontations play a major role in the film. A few other main characters include Pvt. Bell (Chaplin), a man who finds comfort through his love for his wife, and a lieutenant (Cusack) who leads a charge on a bunker. Flashbacks are used to emphasize the character's true emotions. and, when it is all over, the soldiers only realize that this was one island, all their sacrifice given for one island, in a war of many."

      "text": "The Thin Red Line is singularly unique amongst war films.  In some ways, I don't really consider it \"about war\" as much as I consider the film to be about ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.  The question that shapes much of the film is stated by Pvt Witt at the beginning of the film when he reflects upon his mother's death and thinks, \"I wondered what it would be like when I died.  What it would be like to know, that this breath now, was the last one you was ever going to draw.\"  The Thin Red Line defies many conventions, such as the typical convention for a film to have a single protagonist.  The (thin red) lines delineating friend and enemy are cleverly blurred in many ways.  Visually, by casting similair looking men in the three main American roles and casting distinct looking Japanese men as Japanese soldiers.  In the voice-overs, Pvt Witt sees a continuum of life, rather than discrete beings (\"What if all men got one big soul    Another soldier wonders, \"Who are you that lives in all this many forms?\"  Even the lack of a singular protagonist shows how identities are dependent upon each other.\r The Thin Red Line is not a typical war film.  This film is not a celebration of how Americans used violence to defeat the Japanese on Guadalcanal.  The scene that would be a triumphant climax in a typical American war film is emotionally climactic in Malick's The Then Red Line, but it is not a celebration.  Rather, the raid on the Japanese bivouac and winning of the hill is upsetting.\r If you really pay attention to the voice-overs, then I think you have to come to a few conclusions.   Some have criticized the film for being \"heavy handed\" and because the \"director tells you what to think.\"  I think these criticisms are far from the truth.  If you actually pay attention to the film, you'll find that voice-overs contradict each other, or a voice-over contradicts what another character says or does at some point.  The director is simply illustrating that different people have different, often contradictory, points of view.  For example, while two soldiers get into a fist-fight, a voice over states that \"war don't enoble men, it turns them into dogs, poisons the soul.\"  However, anyone watching the film would clearly wonder whether Pvt Witt hadn't been enobled by the war.  Would he really be such a wonderful person if he hadn't gone to war?  Much of the film is ambiguous and contemplative.  There are no easy answers.  When Witt returns to the natives and finds them fighting, notices that they have disease and the skulls of other humans in their huts, the audience is left to wonder if it was Witt's contact with them that made them this way.  Did contact with modern man corrupt these people?  Or did Witt's contact with the violence of the war corrupt his idealization of these people?  I prefer to think that Witt's earlier, idealized view of the natives is what changed, but there is no clear answer given in the film.\r Visually, The Thin Red Line is one of the most beautifully shot films I can ever imagine seeing.  The soundtrack is fantastic.  The sound effects are amazing.  The action sequences are brilliantly done.\r Some have criticized the voice-overs as being \"unrealistic,\" on the basis that combat soldiers don't have time to think such thoughts as expressed in the voice overs.  I think these crticisms are misguided.  The voice-overs used in the film are expressing the thoughts that soldiers in combat have to repress for pragmatic reasons, but these are the important thoughts.  Sure, in combat, soldiers are probably more worried about not getting killed rather than pondering the nature of evil, but the film is about those important thoughts.\r One thing that strikes me about the film is how similar it is to the books, especially From Here to Eternity and The Thin Red Line.  Both are excellent books and indeed some of the lines in the film are taken exactly from the books.  The characters are very similar to those depicted in the books and I think the film captures the spirit of the books very well.\r I think people too often say about films that \"you either love this film or hate it\" but it largely seems to be true of The Thin Red Line.  That being said, I dont believe that people rating it 1/10 genuinely believe it deserves to get a 1/10 rating.  Rather, I believe they are being spiteful and want to bring the rating down to what they think is the \"proper\" rating.  I, however, do genuinely believe this film deserves 10/10."

Almost the perfect opposite of the visceral and gritty \"Saving Private Ryan\" (comparisons are inevitable), The Thin Red Line is presented via a complex narrative style. The narration and action switch from character to character, creating a textured mosaic. Following the strands is difficult and has no doubt put many viewers off the film, but it does have the benefit of giving the soldiers an unprecedented level of depth and emotion, and, as such, dignity. Indeed, this is an oft-overlooked area in the war genre (case point: the cardboard character-types in \"Saving Private Ryan\"...). By shunning a more conventional method of presentation, Malick has created hauntingly hypnotic impression of war. I have little doubt this will go down as a classic."

Even Spielburgs \"Saving Pvt. Ryan\" failed to do that. The only film I'd say does that as well is \"Flags of our Fathers\". This is a must see for every person who comes across it. We owe it to our veterans to at least acknowledge what they went through, and that is, the insanity of war. Or, as Dileep R. put it, \"industrial murder\". Good phrase."

The duality between Malick's gorgeous cinematography and direction, and the gruesome devastating nature of war succeeds better than nearly any other picture with anti-war messages. My only criticism is that the third act of this film seems to dwell a lot. We have the battle for Guadalcanal, followed by another hour of a mix between what I would consider incredible and pandering.

Gordon Tall early in what has to be one of the most innovative war films ever made, and that is truly how the audience feels, as if they are it with the characters. The perfect cinematography and directing create such immersion, that we really feel as though we are one of Charlie company, fighting alongside them. This practically first person view contributes to this being possibly the most visually stimulating war film ever made, and this allows the audience to really picture the horror of combat. When combined with fantastic performances from the likes of Nick Nolte, whose deranged persistence is a highlight of his career, the film is as thought provoking as the best of all war films, Apocalypse Now, and a comparison to that shows how brilliant a film Terrence Malick has created."

That is because the way the actors interpreted the script is clearly different than what the director had in mind.

That's what books do.He smartly understands that to show the inanity of war, and existence as a whole, he can't go down the easy way, that is the ultra-realistic, audience-pandering and shall we say almost pornographic  \"saving private Ryan\" way.However, he struggles to coherently bring his very good ideas to the screen. Too many voice overs show that he needs words, as a crutch, to help viewers understand his philosophy on war.Few scenes are really \"beautiful\" or will stay with us for long, as Apocalypse Now managed to do. It seems his genius was to cast Jim Caviezel - aka Jesus of passion of the Christ- as his main character, a modern Alexei Karamazov, a soldier-monk, whose blue gaze just illuminates each of his scene with a form of saintly beatitude and echoes his scene in the lagoon.The vast blue yonder, not the thin red line...."

I rarely knew who I was looking at, as the soldiers all looked the same, and even more seldom was the feeling that I should care about them. The voice-over-narrators all sounded the same, all spouting a similar, formulaic monologue to the effect of, \"Who am I? Why are we fighting? Where do thoughts come from?\" When I wasn't bored with the monologue, I was engulfed in a score that lacked any power and swelled when it should have been silent or was silent when it should have swelled. In fact, the characters had no dynamics either. They all acted like scared little boys, both the experienced and those whose first war this was, and it is a wonder they weren't all killed by the Japanese. That would have been impossible, however, as the Japanese were inept at shooting just about everything, not to mention they seemed to enjoy running over the hill towards the enemy, shouting instead of taking up positions and shooting. One shining example of this is when the Americans take Hill 210 and run into the main encampment of the Japanese, much to their surprise. The clearly outnumbered Americans then slaughter nearly every Japanese they can point their gun at while the Japanese simply decide it is better to run away than pick up their guns and fight. This film is misguided and sporadic, having only a vague plot, obscure goals, little to no characterization, and a pace so slow there is time to formulate your own cliche ponderings on life."
