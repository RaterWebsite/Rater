  "description": "Graced with a velvet voice, 21-year-old Violet Sanford heads to New York to pursue her dream of becoming a songwriter only to find her aspirations sidelined by the accolades and notoriety she receives at her \"day\" job as a barmaid at Coyote Ugly. The \"Coyotes\" as they are affectionately called tantalize customers and the media alike with their outrageous antics, making Coyote Ugly the watering hole for guys on the prowl.",

      "text": "The film's interesting. The story behind the bar with musicians who manage to make a living one way or another. Half of the movie is probably covered in booze and bras, but that's how most people see it. There are some lessons to be learned, I take that back... a few lessons here. It's worth a rent, just not a buy."

      "text": "Coyote Ugly is one of those movies that hides behind its feel good ending. The fact that everyone ends up happy at the end doesn't mean that the film isn't a sexist, overly long, overly shmaltzy piece of terrible cinema. Sure there may be some who consider the film a piece of female empowerment cinema (Zack Snyder probably) but in the real world its just a story about a girl who gets pushed into a corner and uses her 'feminine' ways to get herself out. The romance between Perabo and Garcia is empty as the two have no chemistry and the scripting is terrible. Its beginning to end a terrible film that I advise you to avoid. Unlike Sucker Punch this piece of female empowerment doesn't have some visually stunning fight scenes to fall back on, just a tepid love story and some uninspired music choices."

      "text": "Yes, the film is cheesy, yes, the film is predictable and finally, yes, the movie is clich\u00e9.But, it was still an honest entertainment and the acting was surprisingly good.It was not a good movie ,but it was not a bad one either."

      "text": "Mostly everyone casts this movie aside until I force them to watch it and than they love it. Jerry Bruckheimer tried to recapture flashdance success and besides making a much better film it also was a hit at the box office. The story is familiar as a small town girl from Sayreville, NJ heads to the big apple in hopes of selling her music. Unsuccessful she picks up at a wild bar called Coyote Ugly where the girls are rough, dance on bars and are master bartenders. She also meets a hunky Australian beau. The movie isn't complex but it is emotionally resonant and overly entertaining. So if you're feeling down it's definitely a pick me up. A young Piper Perabo (Covert Affairs), Bridget Moynahan (The Recruit), Maria Bello (Assault on precinct 13), Adam Garcia (Riding in Cars with boys), John Goodman (10 Cloverfield Lane), Izabella Miko (Step up all in), Melanie Lynskey (Heavenly Creatures) and Tyra Banks (Higher Learning) star.Budget: $45mDomestic Box Office: $61mWorldwide Box Office: $114m4.25/5"
