How is that baby so incredibly quiet? How is this family of four living on 3 fish a week? How was no one else on Earth able to find the solution to this problem - finding out how to turn their strength into a weakness seems pretty obvious) and on and on... the whole thing becomes so overwhelmingly dumb that it is hard to stay in the theatre. How could these morons be the only people left on Earth?

The acting is solid, the premise of the film is ok. The plot and actions are predictable, and only unpredictable when they make no logical sense. The film pacing is amateur. The cgi alien is ok but derivative. The suspension of disbelief is nonexistent. The whole film culminates in the last family in at least their region, maybe the world, just shooting the alien in the face (with a shotgun), after such an long build up, we get that? There was no reason to have the father in the film at all, kill him off early and the tough mum could have carried it to the end. But the whole end was they shoot it? This film would be difficult to watch in a noisy household, the cinema goers laughing (and eating loudly or farting) was bad enough. I was desperately hoping the alien or the whole family stood on the damn nail one by one. Honestly, I wondered if an hour of movie was edited out, and there was a lot more story and a different ending before the final cut. Look out for that version."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "1. The aliens are blind, possessing extraordinaly sensitive hearing, yet they cannot sense the humans with sonar. Nevertheless, they navigate freely through trees, etc. 2.

Also, apparently a shotgun works. 3. I\u2019m sorry, but after the boy dies in the beginning, there is no way that those parents are having sex in the near future. Yet, they do.

A family must live out their lives in silence to avoid being killed by mysterious monsters that hunt purely by sound. A gripping and hugely intense experience. I know it\u2019s only April but this might just be the best horror of the year.Starring and directed by John Krasinski, also starring Emily Blunt, Noah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds. A horror/thriller done right, A Quiet Place delivers exactly what you expect and more. It wastes no time getting started, you\u2019re plunged into silence for a good portion of the film so for all you noisy popcorn munchers out there you\u2019ve been warned. A movie that requires everyone to remain quiet, every sound is deafening and the frights have an even greater impact. A tense and thrilling experience build around a simple yet original idea.

So, just pass on this one."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Take notes, you so-called horror film writers and directors. The primary requirement for a horror movie to be good is to be thrilling and being intense. Not just cheap scares or silence followed by an incomprehensibly loud noise. ..Good : \"A Quiet Place\" directed by John Krasinski is a genuine and tensed horror/thriller. It has a unique premise and backstory. The setup for the story has been done well. The performances by John Krasinski and Emily Blunt, along with the child actors is awesome. The direction of Krasinski is \"awesomer\". The tension and the thrills were genuinely great. That's something I have not seen in a horror/thriller for a long time. Speaking of horror, what we take as \"scary\" is totally subjective. If you're watching this to get some jumpscares or to see a ghost, this ain't your movie. There are many moments that give us the feeling of getting into the jaws of death, unexpectedly. Those were some real thrills. And, the characters know what's gonna kill them and why. So, whenever such things take place, the tension is amplified (no pun intended) and whether or not they are gonna succeed at the particular moment keeps you terrified. For me, anything that keeps you terrified is real horror than some ghosts and jumpscares, so I got my \"horror\" part in this movie, after a long time. It's not that it doesn't have any false scares, just one or two though. Whenever something goes wrong, you can feel the s**t happening. That's some incredible directing. ..Mixed : The final moments were a bit less satisfying for a thrill ride we witnessed for the majority of the movie. There are some notable plot holes regarding some sounds making no significance in the context of the movie's own rules, the way a lot of food, medicines don't get used up after such a long time, the crops being harvested (without any noise?) etc. The movie also shows certain stuff as if it was trying to say \"see this is a plot device, see see SEE!\" and it actually is so. ..Bad : One plotline with Emily Blunt and her \"youngest child\" was something that made no sense to be honest as per the movie's own rules and was obvious to play out in the later part of the movie. The way it was playing out was damn good, but we knew that something was up regarding this. ..Conclusion : I cannot overlook the flaws but man, I had a great time watching the movie. It's flawed but intriguing. It's probably the first Krasinski movie (directorial) I liked so much. ..Rating. ..Score : 8.3/10Grade : A-"}, {"rating": "6", "text": "This was an okay film, but it needed to be thought through a bit more. The universe they've created doesn't follow a set of logical rules and the characters are only half baked.

Krasinski is able to balance both directing and starring in the film rather well, but his ideas towards the story seemed a bit scattershot at times.

I will say however that the chemistry between Krasinski and his wife/costar Emily Blunt and the two children (Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe) was well-done.

Night Shyamalan!Yes, A Quiet Place has some solid acting and solid direction, and cheers to allowing for an actual, hearing-impaired person to play a hearing-impaired person. It's a little scarier, but honestly also a little more dense in the way of the suspension of disbelief (you did NOT seriously just get away with having a baby right next to a sound boogen; no, the deaf girl is NOT going to be aware of all the sound she makes even just breathing, let alone walking through a CORNFIELD).

You've seen Alien? They're Aliens. The best thing about this film was the audience; not a peep out of them (bar the occasional gasp,) the entire running time.

These monsters are unique in that they are blind, but highly sensitive to loud sounds/noises, which they rely sorely on for hunting preys. The first early part of the film has slight problem on the pacing. Things start to get tense when the family members in the film got separated, and subjected to traumatic, life threatening attacks by the monsters, after an accidental loud noise in the house attracted them directly to the farm. Other than the horror aspect, the family love/bonding aspect is reflected very strongly, and brought out in an emotional, though sad way.This is an above average horror movie you should consider watching, even if you are not a fan of horror films.By the way, I read some of the negative reviews, which are mostly complaints about illogical parts in the film. Seriously, it is impossible to make a 'good' horror film if the film maker has to to be logical to the dot. Horror and science fiction is about make-believe made into a story. In fact, if every film is subjected to high level scientific scrutiny in the logical aspect, almost all films (especially horror and sci-fic genre) will be **** If the film never mention about any logic aspect of any plots or ideas in the film, it is either meant to be unknown or open-ended. If you want the proper answer, ASK the director or screen writer. If you want logic based video productions, go watch science documentaries. Do not consider watching any horror/sci fic films, since they will all seem illogical to you. And if this movie is a bad horror film, then what is a good horror film?

You may think you have a plot hole in the movie, but read the newspapers and remember the days! They list every reason why your \"plot hole\" is wrong. What may be bad about the movie is the massive amount of unnecessary jump scares, but it adds to the theme of A Quiet Place. Other than fabulous acting by the Millicent Simmonds, the best thing about the movie is sound direction. Each character has their own version of hearing everything and every time the camera moves to them, you will hear what they hear. You know each character's roles and how they feel in every situation. There is a screen which shows a death and a suicide, which may deter you and probably the only confusing part of the movie (anyone may comment on it here if they have a better explanation) - the only value it would add is the importance of family and how losing your loved ones can effect you.

It's amazing that Jim Halpert from the Office had a horror movie masterpiece in him. It's something you'd never expect from him. Ever. Needless to say, this movie IS a masterpiece, with a solid premise that really excites anyone who hears it. A Quiet Place will have you gripping your seat from start to end. It's brilliantly acted, directed, and co-written by John Krasinski, proving that he may be a director to reckon with in the near future. Emily Blunt gives a solid performance and so does the kids, who you'd think would be the worst part of a movie like this, but they're really good and super believable. The story (besides the incredible premise) is brief but brings power with every scene that is put on screen. You will quickly care for this family, more so than other on-screen characters in other horror movies. Plus, it is clear that the writers played situations cleverly, using spoken words only when the situation actually calls for it. No one's an idiot (actually one exception but spoiler) and the family is betrayed in a way that makes you believe they're real, which is really hard for the horror genre. With amazing pacing, and use of sound, A Quiet Place manages to build tension in the most brilliant way possible -- and Marco Beltrami's nail biting score only adds to this tension building. The creatures are nothing short of terrifying, and could possibly land a place next to Alien and Predator in terms of design and pay off. The movie uses sound so excellently and only makes for a more intense experience. If there is one downside, it's that some of the scares seem really cheap and I mean REALLY cheap. Plus, there is a few (TINY) parts that could be considered plot holes, but they're easily forgiven -- same with the CHEAP scares, because it is as I said before, the horror takes second and the drama takes priority. At its heart, A Quiet Place is a family drama about humans (a family) having to adapt to a new and dangerous threat, while also teaching a valuable lesson on family and the importance of the sense that is sound. You should watch it, then watch it again, because this movie deserves it, and other horror movies should be taking note, because THIS is how GOOD HORROR is done."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "The best thing about the movie is surely the world building that they did, the role system that the characters had to not make one single sound was great, they literally thought in everything. The characters did placed something that it seemed to be salt, or something, in the paths that they needed to use for then, it doesn't make any sound by the steps. The kids playing a board game, using cotton as their game pieces, throwing dice at the carpet. Using sign language, it's incredible how even the kids knew how to use the system, like the parents probably taugh them since they were little children. The movie also showed how the family were self sufficient, how they get their food, in the river, or with planting and showing a place full of corn, and that they usually go to the city to take some supplies.Delivering problems and bigger situations than the plot itself, like Emily characters is preagnant, throughout the movie you keep asking yourself, how in hell she will get a baby without warning the monsters and the movie delivery it with mastery. One of the kids is deaf and the father try to make a device for her to star listening and foward on the story it does have a bigger purpose, isn't their just for be, everything does have a meaning in the story. And they also did show how they could warn when some monster was close without making one sound, they literally though in everything. The characters cannot make a sound, but the script put them in the most impossible situations to not make a sound as possible, it is sadistic. The atmosphere and the sound of this movie are just amazing, like every minumum sound you can hear and be afraid that if it was to loud, the sound design for this one is fabulous.It is scary and terrifying in some moments, the movie have a prologue that just show us perfectly without one word how the movie will be, it does gave to us that sensation of danger that can be reached with a simple error, making a minimum noise, it does this perfectly, you got tense during the movie, any sound that they do, you got paralyzed and scared of what might happen. Every single sequence with the monsters were phenomenal, they are scary and dangerous, because they can't see it does make it so much more intense, it did reminded me a little bit of The Last of Us and Until Dawn.All the actors did a tremendously good job. Emily Blunt in general did a great job, but are some sequences that i won't mention because it is spoiler, but in some particular moment that she is hurt with her baby and is passing for a big struggle, she can pass the perfect idea of despair and fear, her face and full composition of body delivery it perfectly, she is holding emotions. John Krasinski also did a great job, he have a expression of concern that i completely bought it, he can express the idea of love and that he is trying to do the best for his family, he also is the director, wich did a phenomenal job at it. Millicent Simmonds character is actually deaf, just like the actress, and she did a great job in expressing her rebellion in some situations, her concerning with his brother and a possible blaming herself moment. Noah Jupe wich is the other son of the couple, he is very good, doensn't have much to do as the others, but he does express perfectly his fear and his trust on his father, he is concern and did a very good job.It is somethings in the movie that was bad and didn't make sense at all, there is one sequence with Emily in a situation, a situation that is important and you got curious about what is going to happen, then the scene is cutted for another thing, and when it does come back to Emily the role situation is gone like nothing did happened, that seemed like a continuation failure on the movie. Later on the movie are two situations that i didn't though that was righ, with the boy. The cgi and design of the monsters was great, they are scary and completely pass that dangerous and disturbing sense, every time that they showed you got stunned by them, they are completely ferocious and super violent, you understand how they are and wich are their abbilities, the movie did it in a great way.The cinematography is great, like if you are not hearing much, your vision gets more sharpened, every cam is creative, they put a lot of empty places at the scene, for us to get scary and tense if the monster will show up, the characters are put against light to make us concentrate more in the background, and when the monster is on screen it does change to a more close one for us to not know where is it. There is one color thing that when it is showed the red, the dangerousity sense goes so high that i can't even remember when i got that feeling before.The end of the movie with some new knowledge gained during the film, make the end being the best possible, getting implicit what is going to happen and letting the viewer thinking how did it go."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "This movie has a lot of plot holes and you have to be willing to suspend disbelief.

A rating of 6 is generous but Emily is too good looking for anything less."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "First half had promise but it falls apart in the second half. Overbearing score, too much foreshadowing, and the movie's internal logic doesn't seem to be too well thought. I don't think all the rave reviews will do this movie any favors as it has fallen far below expectations. Overall, it's a mediocre movie that squanders it's potential."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "With most of the Worlds population having been killed by creatures, of an unknown origin, that hunt using sound the Abbott family have found refuge on a small farm but must still be wary of making any noise.After a shocking prologue I found the A Quiet Place rather slow going for the first half hour or so. The excellent cast, including the always reliable Emily Blunt, always keep things watchable however and as proceedings ramp up in the second half of the movie the original premise leads to some really tense, dramatic and emotional scenes. One for those who don't mind their horror movies on the slower side."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Pros: - Nice and unique idea - to live without sound - Emily Blunt is great actress, acting at all, of all actors in this move is good - Daughter-actress is deaf in real life - this was strong and noble act by directorCons: numerous plot holes, NUMEROUS - First of all - who in such place and such time ever so stupid to give birth to children? Worst place imaginable. No condoms or? Beyond stupid - Why in the world they have so many light devices but only one firework to distract creatures out? Seriously, some air horns away from home? No? But more lamps for sure!Well, I understand those terrible plot holes had to be here to make a movie as it is. In other time I would give it 2 or 3 out of 10, but now I give it 7 due to pros. Can I recommend it? I'm not sure, prolly not though."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "A gripping story about how sound can kill (and we humans are a noisy bunch). John Krasinski (who also wrote and directed) and Emily Blunt (they are married IRL) do their best to protect their family but it isnt easy.  Fortunately there is enough character development in \"A Quiet Place\" so we care about this group and root for their survival. You'll be thinking about sound in a new way after the movie ends. Would you be able to survive in such an environment? I'm not sure I could."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Positive Sides    Negative Sides + fluent    - There is an annoying little girl  + marvelous actors    - There aren't be explained how the creatures came out  + an original subject    - The end of the story by leaves to the audience    + it is very moving second half to film's"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I'd heard true horror stories about the terrible experience that several viewers had while watching this films with rude audiences so I decided to wait a bit longer to watch it and it was worth it. A room with more than 100 seats and only 4 other people in there with me and most importantly all them in complete silence.Speaking about the film I think the noise and hype that is causing is somewhat excessive but I must give credit to John Krasinski for being his first film as a director because he delivers a solid film of horror and suspense that even though makes some argumentative mistakes like bringing a baby to the world when the world is now a **** up place, its narrative method works very well especially to immerse you inside the story and get people to pay full attention. After all if they don't have words they have the images and that is enough for this film.Quite commendable because thanks to its way of telling its story it reminds the public how a movie should be enjoyed: In complete silence."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This is my 2nd favorite horror movie and one of my favorite movies of all time. The atmosphere of the movie was cool, creepy, and fantastically scary. I loved how original the concept of the movie was. Emily Blunt and John Krasinski gave performances that were stupendous and Millicent Simmonds also gave a great performance. John Krasinski's direction that he took the movie was spectacular. The visual effects were terrific, the creatures were creepy and awesome. The sound design for the movie was very impressive. I also loved the use of sign language by the cast. An A+ movie."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "I really really enjoyed A Quiet Place. Lots of great visual storytelling, brilliant acting, and (mostly) great characters. Although the parents make a choice that sounds incredibly dangerous and irresponsible."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Without exaggeration, the setup for the story here is the best in any movie in this decade so far. Just from the opening scene I felt the tension, I became invested in this world that Krasinski's terrific direction has built, I became invested in the characters, and I already started to root for them. I can't believe how cleverly the rules that were established, and how smartly every detail and idea has been utilized to make this world as scary as it realistic!All the performances are superb! Noah Jupe again proves that he has a very bright future, and Millicent Simmonds's performance is equally brilliant. John Krasinski's performance is as compelling as his direction. As for Emily Blunt, I think she gave her best performance in her career. Yes, I believe that her performance in A Quiet Place is superior to her performances in Sicario and Edge of Tomorrow. But to be honest, the situations her character are put in, and the conditions that surrounded her are what made Emily Blunt gave this Oscar-worthy performance. Of course, this due to the movie's intelligent script.Speaking of the screenplay, I think it's the main reason this movie is so special. Krasinski's direction of course helped to create the creepy and special atmosphere therefore helped to set up the movie's story. But it's the original script that established all that, and fleshed out the characters even with almost no dialogue.Despite the film's low budget, the special effects are spectacular. This is the second time I see great special effects in a low-budget film. the first time was in a good indie film called I Kill Giants. Check it out if you haven't seen it, it worth it.The characters aren't just well-written or compelling, but I found myself totally invested in them. I got all the emotions the characters felt. In fact, I felt that I was experiencing what they were feeling in many different situations. I held my breath when the character were in danger, no pun intended. I literally stopped breathing! Also, I cried twice in this movie! So I think that's enough to tell how emotionally connected with the characters I was, and this is a \"Horror Film\"!As for issues, there were 3 or 4 decisions that aren't so subtle, as usual in horror movies. The jump scares were fine and somewhat effective, except maybe one or two.A Quiet Place is my favorite movie of this year, so far! And I asked myself two questions after watching it, the first question is:Have we, as cinephiles, ever needed talkies?The second one is:When will I raise my voice again while talking? Because every one I talked to after watching A Quiet Place struggled to hear a single word from me!(9/10)"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "A Quiet Place is well shot and creative. John Krasimski is great as the father and directed it fantasticly."}], "recommendations": ["a_quiet_place_part_ii", "us", "color_out_of_space", "annabelle_creation", "sanctum", "the_invisible_man", "signs", "sunshine", "chernobyl_diaries", "oculus", "crawl", "the_ritual", "bird_box", "insidious_the_last_key", "it", "old", "scary_stories_to_tell_in_the_dark", "dark_skies", "annabelle_comes_home", "colossal", "the_curse_of_la_llorona", "the_mist", "the_descent", "annihilation", "ouija_origin_of_evil"]}
