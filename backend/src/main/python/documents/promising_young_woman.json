      "text": "\"Promising Young Woman\" finds first-time writer/director Emerald Fennell pulling no shortage of punches in terms of subject matter, thematics and tone, and leading actor Carey Mulligan at her most vivid and calculating to date. I can't think of a movie I've seen in recent memory where the first 2/3 -- nay -- 7/8 really belie just how satisfyingly well-executed the ending's going to be. This isn't to say that the first two acts or so are bad or even ineffective in any way. It's just that the ending of this movie is so deft in its messaging and potency, that you're really left feeling as though the filmmaker was hustling you for about 90 minutes, whilst surreptitiously setting up one of the most daring endings you'll probably see in a theater all year. Not a bad feeling to be reacquainted with after God knows how long. In any event, I'd say it's more than worth the watch, with an absolute wallop of an ending that's going to have  thinking for days, I'm sure."

Rather than hurting others, it's the threat of hurt to make the victim realize why their action was wrong. My only critique, that prevents full marks, is the tone is a bit off as it reads more as a black-comedy as opposed to an important film about the results of abuse and those who refuse to be accountable for their actions."

I appreciate how the film provoked my thoughts and feelings toward Carrie's journey to revenge, I like how the film was structured to provide back stories and deep dive look why Carey Mulligan's character is plotting revenge to each of her tormentors in the past. The ending is not what I expected but it works very well and Carey Mulligan's acting in this film is superb complemented very well with the ensemble. A must film to watch."

I initially was left feeling empty at the ending, but it truly was the perfect most realistic ending. Life is hard and perpetrators get away and are not held accountable the majority of the time. I bumped up my score from a 9 to a 10 because I truly believe everything was thought out and interesting: the pastel color palette, the angling of the camera for halo and wing motifs, the wide shots throughout making her feel small and insignificant, the casting knowing that the audience has preconceived opinions about the men cast, the outfits and all of the settings,etc."

      "text": "\u201cCan you guess what every woman's worst nightmare is?\u201d You know, I find it genuinely concerning that some people are angry and upset over this movie. I mean, just look on IMDB. Film is subjective and it\u2019s OK not to like this movie, but the thing I don\u2019t understand is why certain people are upset with the themes this movie appropriately presents. Even through deep inside I know why. If it scares them, good, because they deserve to be scared. \u2018Promising Young Woman\u2019 is a rare revenge movie that crosses several genres with one sharp sweep. Some parts are funny, other times it\u2019s romantic, but it can get DARK really quick. I thought the way it was executed was creative and interesting. It shocked me at times with its twist and turns, even though it shouldn\u2019t be surprising. The world can be so dark and treacherous that being surprised by its twisted ways is a bit foolish. Certain elements felt realistic, while other elements of the movie felt...well, like a movie.It\u2019s nice to see that Carey Mulligan\u2019s career is getting better and better. In this movie Mulligan delivers an amazing performance that was captivating to watch. It\u2019s difficult to imagine an actor playing a character who is dealing with so much emotional baggage and vulnerability from past events in her life, but tries her best to conceal it, but Mulligan manages to find the right balance. She can be extremely funny, emotional, and really intimidating. Her drunk acting deserves some praise as well, because within the movie her character pretends to be drunk in bars or nightclubs, to trick \u201cnice guys\u201d who want take advantage on her intoxicated vulnerability, before she drops the act to scare them enough to teach them a lesson. The transformation from drunk to sober was nothing short of impressive. I was surprised to see Bo Burnham here and it\u2019s great seeing him getting acting roles. He is a man of many talents; comedy is one of them and in this movie he never fails to make me smile. Alison Brie and Alfred Molina are also in this movie and both did a great job in their small roles. I give this movie major credit for being unpredictable. I would sometimes try to guess where the story might be heading, to only have the rug pulled right under me. It was an interesting choice to cast likeable actors in the roles of predators and despicable people. The movie smartly suggests that people like these can easily hide their sinister side through a fake smile and popularity. Now I\u2019m being vague about certain things because I\u2019m hoping what I\u2019ve said so far might boost your interest in checking this one. I\u2019m starting to do that now, going in blind and leaving impressed (hopefully). Director and writer Emerald Fennell did a solid job on delivering a fresh and unique take on a brutal topic with extreme care on the subject matter. This is also her direct debut and everything I\u2019ve seen on screen shows great potential for her as a filmmaker in the future. The look of the movie has that candy-like colour to it, which made the movie look visually appealing to the eye. Revenge has never looked so colourful. Without spoiling the ending for the movie, but the way it concludes is very strange and rare. I was both sad and happy at the same time. However, it can also make or break the movie for some, while I was kind of mixed on it. Some parts of the ending were realistic, as it was a cold reminder for us that sometimes justice isn\u2019t always severed. Unfortunately, this is where my issues start to come in. When I said some parts of the ending was dark and realistic, well to me it didn\u2019t quite commit to that with the last few minutes of the movie. I just wished they took more of a real approach to conclude the conflict that could be plausible. I also thought the movie was a little on the nose with its social message at times.And that\u2019s really it for issues. What, you expected more? Surprise!Overall rating: Revenge is best severed in confetti and rainbow colours."

      "text": "This was an excellent film that I didn\u2019t expect to be this good. It\u2019s insane that this is a directoral debut for Emerald Fennell because her direction is fantastic. Every shot and character is so incredibly well planned and thought it. I\u2019m very excited to see what this director is capable of in the future. Carey Mulligan is incredible as the main character. It\u2019s easily one of my favorite performances of the entire year. Her reactions and how she delivers her lines is fantastic and I\u2019m excited to see what she does with her career after this. Every performance here is great to be honest. I always feel skeptical when they cast comedians in films that are supposed to be dramatic but Bo Burnham killed it here. It goes to show that anyone can do an amazing job given the right material. This has some of the best framing and cinematography of the year. Each shot is visually pleasing in how it\u2019s framed and each shot knows what needs to be in it. Every shot felt to me like it was intentional in what it wanted to show. In other words, there was a certain aesthetic to the film that worked very well for the tone. The story of the film is powerful, emotional, well thought out, and relevant. The film has a lot to say about rape and sexual assault and How authority figures act on it without being overbearing or too on the nose but it can feel like that at points. The last 45 minutes of this film is just gut punch after gut punch and it\u2019s great. The film does a great job at making you feel for Mulligan\u2019s character. While some may find the ending a little over the top and dumb, I didn\u2019t. I thought the ending made logical sense and it was a huge pump in the fist for the main character as I was starting to root for her. I would highly recommend checking this out if you are okay with the dark subject matter."

I was not 100% convinced by the ending, but when a friend compared it to \"Killing Eve\" it made more sense. (Fennel worked on Killing Eve.)My one complaint is that Laverne Cox was underused as the friend/co-worker. More could have been mined from that relationship.However, the casting was so spot on and the story was, unfortunately, all too familiar.

Of course, due to the pandemic, the original release date of April 2020 was scrapped and I had to wait until after Christmas to finally see it. AND, I risked it all to see this movie in a theater; but, as of today, you can now catch Carey Mulligan\u2019s stellar performance from the comfort of your own home. Promising Young Woman is best if you go into it cold, but as a brief synopsis, Emerald Fennell wrote and directed this story about a young woman, whose life has stalled since a tragic event in her past, and follows the extreme measures she takes to cope until a new opportunity presents itself. I can\u2019t keep a secret \u2013 this movie blew me away.Carey Mulligan plays Cassie, the young woman with the aforementioned promise, whose world was rocked when she was in medical school, and now she\u2019s taking matters into her own hands. Cassie is bold and cunning and smart as a whip. She\u2019s disarming, reckless and determined. Mulligan hits every note just right and plays Cassie with that delicate balance in tone that this film strives for. It is something special when the right role and the perfect actress come together. Don\u2019t be surprised to see Carey Mulligan popping up in this year\u2019s Best Actress races.This is Emerald Fennell\u2019s first feature film as a director, and she has previously written episodes of \u201cKilling Eve.\u201d She clearly has a firm handle on mixing thrilling elements and humor. The social commentary throughout the film is so thought-provoking while also being incredibly entertaining. There is not a boring moment throughout. Fennell has written not only an interesting plot, but the dialogue throughout is sly and calculated to keep you off guard.There is some discussion about whether Promising Young Woman is a comedy or a drama. That categorization probably doesn\u2019t matter. It certainly is dramatic, and there is definitely comedy here, but it is as dark as they come. With a cast populated by Bo Burnham, Alison Brie, Jennifer Coolidge, Max Greenfield, among others, there is a clear intent to infuse humor into what can be a dark and triggering subject matter. No matter how you classify it, ultimately, it is just really good.Really, everything comes together just right in Promising Young Woman. It is refreshing to see a new film that has something new to say. This one is it. Do not miss it. If you want to brave the theaters or rent this one at home, it is worth the time and money and the big box of popcorn."

I understand what they are trying to cover in this movie: the predatory nature of some men. But they are doing it in a very ham-fisted, pretentious, unrealistic way, very typical of these third-wave feminist movies that hate men and absolve women of all responsibility of their actions. The men in this movie are all portrayed as dishonest, weak cowards, and the protagonist gets away with mad behaviors that she would never get away with in real life. There is a scene where she toys with a person\u2019s daughter, and any parent will tell you that if someone did that to their child, they would beat that person within an inch of their life. In this movie, the parent just says \u201cyou\u2019re right, I understand your point of view now\u201d. Ridiculous. My wife hated the movie as well.

The movie inverts the trope of 'a wronged man' who becomes a hero by avenging his friends killed or wronged by generic evildoers. Everything from Batman to Marvel soars to this generic idea of the transformation of a person from the everyday type to a hero through revenge and vengeance. But here the payoff is painful, the lead character Cassie portrayed as mentally imbalanced, wildly inappropriate, suffering PTSD, sexy, funny, hopeful, and the proverbial loose cannon.

It's such a shame, though, the movie's handling of its subject matter is extremely heavy-handed. It seems to assume that by merely touching on the social issue in hand would be enough to solve it, something that's misguiding in itself. Moreover, instead of directing its energy at conveying its message, it unapologetically celebratory basks in its perfunctory manifesto without offering any real insights. Still, I believe it really could've been better, given the promising \"Dean Walker\" subplot in which we could see only a glimpse of the depth this movie, sadly, has forsaken for reveling in its underdeveloped premise with great panache. Props for the superb cinematography and the fact it's an enjoyable watch are due, nonetheless. (4.5/10)"

      "text": "While it aspires to make a profound statement about the mistreatment of women, this dark comedy/revenge thriller unfortunately misses the mark in several key areas and, sadly, ends up sending a message that makes its victims look no better than those who victimize them. Insufficiently explained story elements and an awful, overlong ending detract even further, scraping some of the glossy polish off this otherwise-stylized offering. To its credit, the superb, award-worthy performance of Carey Mulligan and the film's occasionally inspired writing help to elevate this picture to a level above where it might have otherwise landed, but, regrettably, that's not enough to save this attempt at cinematic nobility. Don't buy into the hype; it's not worthy of the excessive praise."

      "text": "This revenge thriller sees Carey Mulligan as the titular young woman of this film, a vigilante who goes around feigning drunkenness at nightclubs in order to trick men into trying to sexually assault and have their way with her as retribution for a past crime committed against her and a friend. Oh boy... Where to even begin with this one. I had very conflicting feelings going into this one. Part of me thought it did look in fact very promising and clever, while the other part of me thought that it looked like a far-fetched and preachy statement on behalf of the 'Me Too' movement. And unfortunately, this film without a doubt turned out to be the latter for me, but it didn't even prepare me for how much worse this film turned out to be in the final quarter or so. Not only did it squander and seemingly only scrape the surface of its premise and potential, it simply missed the opportunity to make a clever statement on the 'Me Too' movement as a whole, with the exception of only a couple of clever scenes and dialogue in my opinion. And then we come to the final quarter or so of the film, which starts to forget about the whole point of the film (justice for wronged women) and instead begins to dive into sadism before attempting to deliver quite possibly one of the most far-fetched and absurd punchlines I've ever seen in a film, so much so that by the time it arrives, it was far too late for the film to be redeemed in any way for me. I just could not suspend my disbelief for the life of me. Literally the only redeeming quality of this film is Carey Mulligan's career-best performance on display here. She doesn't hold back at all and is as fierce and as memorable as she'll probably ever be. Otherwise, this film was overall not only a major misfire and missed opportunity to make a much more focused, clever and on-point statement on sexual misconduct and the 'Me Too' movement, but it's quite simply the worst film of 2020 for me. There's just no other way around it."

Within the first 5 minutes she turned to me and said \"oh no it is going to be one of these movies\", and I said give it a chance. It will get good.Well it didn't get good. This movie was boring, pretentious,  you barely see any murder in it, Nd above all else is a man hating movie.It goes out of it's way to make sure you know men are bad and deserve to be punished, hell even the men who did nothing wrong at all deserve to be punished.  With a twist ending that will make you leave with a sour taste in your mouth, this film is a big letdown  and just another movie that panders to man hating feminism.  And at 2 1/2 hours, oh boy was this a slog."

      "text": "If you've seen the trailer to this movie, you've been cheated even before you see a second of the actual film (i.e., the trailer  implies one plot, while the movie has another ...). With this stated, let's discuss \"the flick\". About the only thing good about it is Carey Mulligan's magnificent, Oscar nominated performance (spoiler alert, she's not gonna win this time, but she will eventually). Most of the other performances are so poor that you aren't sure if this is supposed to be thriller or a parody (and that's the DIRECTOR'S FAULT).  The subject matter of this film is no joke, yet the script treats it in a less than compelling way.  For the first 30 minutes, I found myself repeatedly saying, \"this is shyte\".  Then, for the briefest of moments, the plot finally begins to build into something that \"might\" prove engaging and thus worth watching.  But, alas,  it doesn't last and I was back to saying the \"shyte\" word again.  I will only further state that the climax and denouement are incredibly \"disappointing\".  So, from preview to closing credits, this film is a stinker (may have something to do with the \"shyte\" in between)."

      "text": "From the trailer, this looks like a devious woman (Carey Mulligan) lures predatory men by pretending to be very drunk, then exacts violent revenge. The reality is quite different. Granted, she does pursue men who prey, but only to shame them. This woman, who\u2019s deeply disturbed after losing her best friend, sets out for retribution from everyone who was involved in the original act. While her schemes are a bit diabolical, the sullen drama and slow pace tamp it down. Mulligan does an effective job, but Bo Burnham, as her new beau, offers a few moments of charm and respite from the endless sullen sulking. Yes, there are messages about the issues around rape and consent, but the whole thing aims for more emotional connection than it produces."
