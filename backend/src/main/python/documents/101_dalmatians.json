Glenn Close was perfect casting for Cruella De Vil. She is actually evil, and really brings the character to life. Plus the dogs are so much cuter in real life!"

I actually think the movie a big failure in cinematic terms. But for watching with family at times like Christmas or Easter is perfect, and the kids do not dislike."

      "text": "Despite a superb performance from Glenn Close as Cruella de Vil 101 Dalmatians never achieves more than any other mid-level Disney film like Beethoven. It's far from terrible but almost everything in it has been seen before and you'd be much better off watching the more entertaining cartoon version."

      "text": "This, for me, is truly something of a unique film. It has all the corniness and cheap slapstick of a plethora of other comedies cashing in on popular trends  which in this case, was \"Home Alone\"  while otherwise being painfully sappy. Yet, for some reason, \"101 Dalmatians\" doesn't bother me when it's corny. And I think it's because it's so thoroughly and consistently corny that you just end up buying into this strange pseudo-cartoon world they build. It knows how silly it is and just enjoys itself nonetheless, and the result is a movie you really just can't help but like. It's so innocent and fluffed with lighthearted chuckle that it's very hard to call it unenjoyable, no matter how bad one might consider it. And of course, you have Glenn Close turning in a gleefully over-the-top performance as Cruella DeVil  who, by the way, turns everything she touches into some awesome piece of art direction  and an affectionately charming and humorous Hugh Laurie as one of her bumbling dognappers. This was never meant to be taken seriously. That's clear from the start. And I honestly have to call it a guilty pleasure."

Honestly, who wants to watch some trashy remake when they can watch the original heartwarming animated classic. There's a good Cruella performance but apart from that all I can say is. Why?"

Glenn close is absolutely fantastic and sooo true to the cartoon. The dog and animal trainers did a great job as the communication between the animal is very well done, I appreciated every aspect of the movie, the two Dalmatian mom and pop look very similar to the cartoon and VERY WELL trained!  They should rerelease this movie. More people need to see it and review it. ( how can Aquaman the movie get better review than this , Aquaman was awful)I am an adult and I absolutely enjoyed it, must see film. Good for adults and kids!!!! Again kudos to the dog trainers"

      "text": "This film is a live-action that repeats and updates the story of \"101 Dalmatians\", an animated film that Disney launched in the early sixties. The plot has some minor changes and is brought to our time, but its virtually the same in both films. One of the most drastic changes, however, is that the animals in this film don't speak, even though they demonstrate intelligence and know how to face danger. The human cast has Jeff Daniels, Joely Richardson, Joan Plowright and Hugh Fraser, very experienced British and American actors, but its Glenn Close who stands out, in the iconic role of the villain, Cruella De Vil, giving us one of the most remarkable performances of her career so far, and the best interpretation of what, for many, is Disney's biggest villain. Remarkable! The team that created the costumes of this character also deserves congratulations, combining charm and good taste with Cruella's sinister attraction by genuine fur (of course, in the film they weren't real fur). Situational jokes are the strongest part of the film, thanks to Hugh Laurie and Mark Williams, who brought to life the two absolutely stupid thugs who were supposed to keep the dogs under control. They're the main comic element, contrasting with the sweetness of those little puppies. It's a great movie for the whole family to watch together, have a laugh and spend some quality time together."
