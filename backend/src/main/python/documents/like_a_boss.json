Salma Hayek is the glamourous villain who owns a giant company that wants to buy them out. In her broad comic style Haddish has a few funny moments, but this weak script shows how much of her charm lies in her innate ability. Byrne and Hayek aren't even mildly amusing . Even Jennifer Coolidge (who can make anything hilarious) falls flat with the lousy jokes. The plot is painfully predictable and the direction (while energetic) never adds any fun or clever touches. Not a good way to start out the New Year."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I think this movie is getting pretty unfairly dragged through the mud.  Is this art?  Not by a mile.  Yes, it's supremely \"lightweight\" but sometimes that's all you want.  It's a pleasant way to spend a an hour and a half and there are some legitimately hilarious lines.  Tiffany Haddish and Rose Byrne are a pretty funny duo.

Like A Boss is a feeble, predictable buddy comedy that retreads an old premise, does absolutely nothing new and only succeeds in its pairing of its stars, Tiffany Haddish and Rose Byrne. The basic premise is that two life-long friends own a make-up company, Mia & Mel, that\u2019s falling on hard financial times when they get approached by a cosmetics mogul played by a be-wigged, Salma Hayek. Hijinks ensue! And, do they learn a lesson about friendship? Miguel Arteta has directed this derivative comedy and not really found anything worthy of your time or the stars.There are very few bright spots here. Rose Byrne is an unlikely comedic actress. She\u2019s been good in supporting roles in Bridesmaids and Neighbors. There are bigger comedy stars, but Byrne has her niche. She does well here as desperate and downtrodden, in a funny way. Although a bigger personality, Tiffany Haddish falls in line with Byrne\u2019s rhythms and they ultimately work well together. I wish there was a better project for them. I\u2019ll also note that Billy Porter has some good scenes and gets some laughs. The problem with the scenes with Porter is that they are in the trailer and TV commercials, so you know exactly what\u2019s coming.Like a Boss does zip by. While being very formulaic and predictable, the movie does not linger on anything. In fact, the end comes very fast on the heels of the final confrontation. (You know how these movies go!) At one point, the characters mention weeks have gone by but it had barely been a minute of movie time. It was all very slight, not surprising and not funny enough to be worth it.All of the talents involved have better movies or TV projects that you could watch. Watch Girls Trip for a 20th time for your Tiffany Haddish fix. Rose Byrne is better in Neighbors or Bridesmaids or Spy. Check out Salma Hayek in Beatriz at Dinner, which was also directed by Miguel Arteta. I will say that there was a group of raucous, probably drunk, ladies in the theater I was in, who cackled, howled and talked through much of the movie.If you must, grab your drunk girlfriends and run the movie in the background on your girls\u2019 night in this summer, but skip it in the theater. It\u2019s not even worth the 83 or so minutes."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Haddish and Byrne provide solid performances, but it\u2019s not enough to make up for an unoriginal script with more cringe than laughs. If you enjoyed the trailer, stop there \u2013 every \u201cfunny\u201d moment is already included."}], "recommendations": ["tammy", "dirty_grandpa", "tower_heist", "wedding_crashers", "date_night", "30_minutes_or_less", "little_fockers", "the_other_guys", "sex_drive", "identity_thief", "neighbors", "the_wedding_ringer", "the_proposal", "ride_along", "trainwreck", "paul_blart_mall_cop", "thunder_force", "dodgeball_a_true_underdog_story", "wanderlust", "a_bad_moms_christmas", "couples_retreat", "horrible_bosses_2", "forgetting_sarah_marshall", "what_happens_in_vegas", "the_longest_yard"]}
