The new flick is filled with easter eggs, you may call simple fanservice, but isn\u00b4t it all about that? The fans? We waited such a long time for a GOOD new Ghostbusters movie and now we have it. The old crew passes the torch in a respectful way and beside of that: This movie is lots of fun. Perfect popcorn entertainment. Don\u00b4t listen to the critics, just grab your popcorn, lay back and enjoy a really heartwarming Ghostbusters film."

I think today critics and Hollywood kill what we love as movie goers, and that\u2019s to just have something fun and different to watch. Breath of fresh air verses the super hero and Netflix movies that\u2019s been thrown out this last decade."

The actors and actresses in this movie bring a new energy into the franchise, and a perspective that I think lacked in the original. While some might scoff at the idea of not having Bill make puns every five seconds, the humor in this is no less entertaining for those who can put the gatekeeping aside. It is filled with plenty of call backs that will establish itself as a knowledgeable successor to a beloved franchise."

To us, the story is very well written to include the old Ghostbusters play their parts and way better than 2016 Ghostbusters portrayal of original Ghostbuster characters play meaningless parts. This movie has heart, it ties into the 1st movie and is inclusive to old fans and new fans including the children. I wish I could of seen adult Oscar or Rick Moranis' character, but seeing that it was the new generation starting from Egon's family maybe the next sequel might have those two in it. If the feeling you got from watching them altogether made you feel like a kid again on the tonight show, this is exactly how I felt when I got to watch this new movie. It made my eyes water. I hope you all enjoy this movie and experience."

Ghostbusters Afterlife was exactly what it needed to be.. a loving homage to a beloved film series and a touching family film with just a hint of the subtle \"horro\" the original brought to the table. There were parts that made me jump.. parts that made me laugh.. and, most importantly for this film, parts that made me cry. I don't admit this lightly, the end of this film hit me hard and I loved it!I understand some folks being put off by the reluance on nostalgia and rehashed story beats... but I DON'T CARE! As a fan who saw the originals in the theaters as a kid, and taking my children to see this one now... when so many terrible and half-hearted sequels have been shoved out 9ver the last decade...... this was precisely what I wanted and I can not stress enough how much I appreciate everyone involved in this movie for bringing so much passion and respect to a franchise that so important to me.Very few movies over the last 10 or so years have really hit me emotionally.  But this one delivered a gut-punch in the best possible way."

      "text": "Afterlife is the kind of movie that leans heavily into the nostalgia factor and does little to really open the door to the next stage of adventures. I think fans view it more positively than they would have if the 2016 film never existed because when you have such a negative film that preceded it, You can only go up from there. And while Afterlife is by no means a bad movie, especially in comparison to the 2016 film or even GB2, It certainly isn't a memorable one.The characters are underdeveloped to a fault. The mother is given no backstory at all, There is a character called Podcast because he has a podcast, and Trevor is your typical male teenage character. The story is painfully slow at times and the CGI looks dated even for a film from 2021, specifically, I'd like to point out the god-awful Walmart scene so heavily featured in the trailers.The only two redeemable things about this movie are Paul Rudd and Mckenna Grace. Rudd perfectly captures the few attempts at humor in the film, which is more often missed than hit, but he is frustratingly absent in the second half. Grace is the true star of the film and really helped make it tolerable as this was very much her journey.All in all, Fans are gonna enjoy it for the nostalgia factor but I feel over time it would be received as highly. It's tolerable but forgettable. There isn't a single stand-out moment in this film and it runs for at least a good 20 minutes too long IMO."

      "text": "I was a bit hesitant to watch this movie. Being a big fan of the first two movies and the video game that essentially was GB3, I was hearing mixed reviews all over the place. To all the haters: You're wrong. Afterlife is a love letter to the legacy of the first two movies and clearly was written with allot of love and respect. True, it does rehash allot of elements and has allot of fan service, but it's not as bad as some critics make it out to be. Afterlife essentially finishes off the story that started in the original Ghostbusters and also manages to have it's own identity. Grace Mckenna steals the show with a fantastic performance, and at such a young age. Clearly this is an actress that'll be really big one day. Paul Rudd is his usual self and brings allot of charm. Newcomer Logan Kim is a hoot, clearly not as seasoned as his costars, but his charm grows on you and compliments Mckenna's character nicely. Carrie Coon is okay, but I feel allot more could have been done with her character. The rest of the cast kind of just fade into the background. Fortunately all the cameos are used sparingly and don't steal too much of the spotlight.Overall:Ghostbusters Afterlife is a welcome addition to the Ghostbusters franchise and a great conclusion to the original story arch. From here Ghostbusters has the chance to start a new chapter, which is slightly teased in the post credits scene."

So my expectations were low, especially in regards to the 2016 film as films appeared to only be about content less content. In contract, Ghostbusters: Afterlife was fun, wholesome, original and uplifting. It was refreshing to go to a theater, pay a bunch of money, and actually being entertained. It was almost shocking how good this film was.After seeing the character development, especially that of Phoebe Spengler (McKenna Grace), playing a character who is someone who is not neuro typical, brought me to tears. My daughter was recently diagnosed as not Neuro typical. So when I saw Phoebe's character develop into a thriving, confident, butt-kicking character, it really touched me. Thank you for writing this, and for McKenna Grace portraying this character. Keep it up."

(And quite a few moments where me and my wife were applauding the screen which is really rare). Unlike many movies I've seen in recent years, it managed to compellingly grab my attention and inspire awe at several points. (Now that probably is nostalgia in play).There's two credits scenes, one mid-way, one at the end.Direction was awesome. Script was very well done and on point. Production design was fantastic. And bonus unexpected Olivia Wilde. Cinematography was great too, and unlike too many recent films, properly lit!Well done to everyone involved.

If you love the original Ghostbusters, go and see this movie. Unfortunately, I must admit it felt like they dropped the ball towards the final act and it did end up feeling a little rushed. I think it would have benefited from an extra 20 mins to really get the final act to the same level as the rest of the movie. Maybe this is something that could be rectified with an extended cut? Overall, I'd say it's a good laugh, and it managed to restore my faith in the franchise after the unspeakable reboot we were served in 2016."

The movie succeeds with both it's touching family story, whether that's the family you find or the ones you're stuck with, and it's mystifying sci-fi horror side. It's a splendid movie that was very obviously made for fans of the original, although it still doesn't quite capture all of it's appeal.

The nostalgia made me so happy, but it didn't just rely on that, even though it technically had to. It successfully attempted to make its own story that held itself up without the ghostbuster crutch. Favourite scene was when the little marshmallow men were wreaking havoc. OMG, it was so funny and they were so cute! I loved Paul Rudd in this. He played his role very well. I also liked most of the actors. Podcast was one of the biggest highlights. SO funny! Now, here are some things I didn't like: I wasn't a big fan of Phoebe. She sort of eventually grew on me, but she was quite obnoxious. She seemed way too rude for my liking, but she didn't ruin the movie or anything. It was still enjoyable. I also didn't like how there weren't many different types of ghosts. They had some big scenes of nostalgic ones, but others were shown very quickly as if they were trying to rush the 3rd act to end it. I don't know if they're making a 2nd film, I don't think they necessarily should, even though I wouldn't be mad if they did, but there were very few ghosts in this. I also wished all the kids were teens, like Phoebe and Podcast, but again it didn't ruin the movie. Overall, I enjoyed it and I would definitely come back and rewatch it."
