While it takes on a more absurd and crazier tone with the comedy the attention to detail in the actual plot is admirable. The crime (which are characters expectedly goof up at every turn) is written believably and smartly. It makes it look like our characters could pull it off smoothly should they stop tripping over themselves. However if they did that then this wouldn't be a comedy.\r It's a hilarious sequel that manages to avoid the traps many comedies series fall into. If you liked the first then you should check this one out. It's great to see the characters back again with more hilarious material.\r I give \"Horrible Bosses 2\" and 8.5/10."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "A much improved and underrated sequel.

The critics say this movie sucks, yet I laughed out loud more than any movie I've seen in a very long time.\r Not only are the three main stars great, but when Jennifer Aniston, Jamie Foxx, or Kevin Spacey show up on the screen you know it's just going to get funnier.\r If you listen to the critics you won't see this movie. Fun, funny and entertaining is a very bad combination."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Horrible Bosses 2 was a good sequel. It was about as good as the first. The previews did not spoil the movie.

If you liked the first one, you should see this one."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "It is about as respectful and rational as a hooker on amphetamines, but \"Horrible Bosses 2\" is also absurdly entertaining and ashamedly hilarious to boot."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Tired, lazy, overbearing are the words I use to describe this one. The schtick given by the stars gets tiresome after an hour. Jennifer Aniston raises or lowers the bar on her over the top character and it is the most entertaining of this film. She seems shoehorned into the plot though as she has nothing to really do with the story. The first Horrible Bosses was a clever refreshing stiff drink of a film and this one is warm soda."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "It definitely had its moments and much of the charm that the first film created, but unfortunately, this one exhausted itself long before the film was over due to the weaker gags and lack of an original or funny story this time around in comparison to the first. In fact, there were too many noticeable instances where jokes and gags from the first film were poorly recycled into this one. While the new story and writing was an overall disappointment, Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, and Jason Sudeikis, like in the first film, are able to make the most out of it and they themselves managed to make the film slightly worthwhile. It was good to see Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey, and Jamie Foxx reprise their roles, but they didn't have enough screentime in my opinion. Christoph Waltz was ok. I also wish he had a little more screentime. Chris Pine does a pretty decent job as Waltz's crazed son. So while the story was a bit weak and lacking this time around, the actors all managed to make it a fun film for the most part. Overall, it isn't terrible, but it certainly doesn't hold a candle to the original."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "\"Horrible Bosses 2\" 10 Scale Rating: 7.5 (Very Good) ...\r The Good: The film picks up where the last one left off and doesn't skip a beat. Bateman, Day, and Sudeikis exhibit the same comedic timing that made the first film so good. The supporting cast was also up to the task as Aniston, Foxx, Spacey, and newcomers Pine and Waltz all seemed to genuinely have fun making the film. While the premise and story is all kinds of silly, it works. Not quite as hilarious (or as good) as the first film, but extremely funny in it's own right and chock full of laugh-out-loud moments.\r The Bad: At times, the obvious ad lib moments didn't work as well and caused a few scenes to stretch longer than they needed to ... with unfunny results. On a couple of occasions, the usually funny Charlie Day rambled a little long and it didn't work. That only happened a time or two, but did take away from the film somewhat. Lastly, I would have liked to have seen more of Sudeikis who seemed to rarely have any moments of his own."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Charlie Day, Jason Bateman and Jason Sudeikis are back to launch their own business. When they get screwed (by Christoph Waltz), they hatch a plan to kidnap his son (Chris Pine). The leading trio still has great comic chemistry and their non-stop banter provides most of the laughs. Jennifer Aniston provides some outrageous moments and Jamie Foxx gets in a few, but the plot and supporting roles take a back seat to the quick-witted leads. It feels like an opportunity for them to go on an extended improvisation, but the brisk pacing keeps it from ever feeling self-indulgent."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "My boyfriend and I had watched all other movies available and this was the only one left that held promise which we hadn't seem yet.

I would even say funnier than the first. Day and Sudeikis' characters do act overly stupid together more often than the first movie in an annoying way a couple of times (they weren't annoying at all in the first movie) but I guess Pine's character being added keeps the group's dynamic entertaining. Most importantly, the movie made me laugh a lot. I felt all the bosses and Fox were used well enough also. I guess Waltz could have had more screentime. You can hardly expect them all to get enormous roles though.."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Meh, good for mild, mind-numbing entertainment.\rI'm sure in a few years, these movies will be on FX or USA on repeat for all to enjoy.\rIn summary I'd skip the theater and wait for the rental to see it, if at all."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Such a stupid movie. Not downright horrible like some other comedy sequels, but it's exactly the same thing as the first one, and the initial premise isn't nearly interesting enough to expand into a sequel."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Horrible Bosses 2 has some smart humor that is not always funny, likable characters that are sometimes annoying and unrealistic, past characters that are just unnecessary.

To say the film is annoying is a massive understatement, it is positively grating. Devoid of laughs, with a cast who look like they wish they were somewhere else, this displays everything that is wrong with the studio machine. A film made for the sole reason to try and take money from a gullible public without putting in any effort. Dismal and shameful."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Very entertaining comedy which is perhaps just a tad overlong. The screenplay may not be the most sophisticated one out there, but it does provide loads of laughs. In fact the dialogue is so fast and furious that some jokes get sacrificed along the way if you so much as look at your pop corn. A lot of the humour is very crude but the playing of the cast is so lively, enthusiastic and good natured that offense is never taken.\rJason Bateman makes for an impressive 'straight' foil to the comic goonery provided by Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis,, and both Chris Pine and Jennifer Anniston enter into the spirit of the movie with their tongues very firmly in their cheeks. Only Christoph Waltz is a bit tiresome. The two time Oscar winner's 'wolf in sheep's clothing' grin is beginning to pall a bit in its repetitiveness. He really does need to try and stretch himself in future projects before he becomes to firmly entrenched in the realms of self parody.\rOverall though, this is a better than average comedy that is consistently good fun."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "De esas veces que el t\u00edtulo no tiene nada que ver con la trama, lo \u00fanico en que se parece a su antecesora es que es el mismo reparto, misma falta de qu\u00edmica y misma direcci\u00f3n a ning\u00fan lado."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Horrible Bosses 2 was OK, nothing great and nothing terrible. Even though it has its flaws it's still funny and what make the movie work is the great chemistry the 3 leads have. Another thing i found great was that they didn't do the same thing all over again! (The Hangover 2) They actually went in a different direction with the plot. The involvement of Chris Pine was great, he was definitely a stand out and i kind of feel like they dropped the ball at the end because i would have liked to see him become a 4th member to the crew! BUT they fell into cliched movie twists and ruined that great possibility. Christoph Waltz honestly felt so wasted! His character could have been played by anyone else really. The return of the previous supporting characters worked, except for Kevin Spacey's who we'll talk about in a sec. **** Jones was great! and he was more involved in the plot than the previous film which i enjoyed! Julia's character was back because of boners lol but seriously she was good! They made her character get involved with Jason Batemans which i don't even think they encountered in first! Anyways both were great, now to Spacey! His cameo was more of a just because \"One liner jokes\" kind of thing. He added NOTHING to the film. I Mean i like Kevin and his character but it was pointless. Another thing that i didn't like was that they dumbed down the characters! Mostly Charlie Day's and Jason Sudeikis. The purposely made them MORE STUPID! Because having stupid people makes for more funny situations, i just felt that it was a step back for the characters! Overall yes there's some laughs and the story was different. It works, but the film could have been SO MUCH BETTER! I hope that the 3rd involves Kevin Spacey's character getting released from prison and trying to get revenge! idk but if they're planning on a 3rd just have a good PLOT! and don't make the characters even more stupid! I'm giving Horrible Bosses 2 a 7/10."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Its truly a miracle that I even watched Horrible Bosses 2 because I can't say I was a big fan of the original film. The trailer made the movie look like it was going to be a dud but they saved all the good jokes for people who watch it. I like the extension of the cast with the additions of Chris Pine, Christoph Waltz and Jonathan Banks. Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day were both really funny, Jason Bateman was just alright, he could have been funnier, but as a whole the main characters fit together really well. You can tell that they are very comfortable with each other. You don't have to enjoy the first movie in order to enjoy the sequel, but I do recommend watching the first movie because you see it."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "If you did not like the first one, than it will almost be a miracle if you like this second installment that doesent even deserve to be stuck on the big screen."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "A passable-at-best follow up to an actually really good first movie. HB2 plays out pretty much the same way the first movie did, only this time it tries to incorporate jokes that would have been okay-ish in The Hangover 3 and more recent It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia seasons, as well as a gratuitous use of the F-bomb courtesy of Jason Bateman.

I'm mostly disappointed in the awful use of the cast in this film who are clearly phenomenal actors. Horrible Bosses 2 doesn't have Bosses to fight back against unless they refer to Waltz' brief character, the trio themselves or perhaps even the writers of this unimaginative narrative.

I will admit that, being a female, I could do without some of the scatological humor that marks both Horrible Bosses #1 and #2 (er, no pun intended), such as that toothbrush scene, but the parts that turned me off are outweighed by the parts that I did enjoy, such as the many little offhand throwaway remarks that sounded like they could have been improvised. (Example: Talking about the villain Chris Pine, Jason Sudeikis tosses out a line like \"Look how BLUE his eyes get when he's crying!\") I love that kind of stuff.\r Jason Sudeikis, Jason Bateman, and Charlie Day are all very funny fellows and adorable to boot.

In this unnecessary sequel, the boys have gone into business for themselves, and in common fashion have signed away their invention to an investor for a fraction of what it's worth. Realizing they've been taken, they plan on kidnapping the billionaires son and the ridiculousness begins again. The old bosses and old accomplishes join new face for another adventure that's even more absurd than the first one was. I watched this film because I love Jason Sudeikis, he is one of my favorite comedic actors, however Charlie Day is not. I really don't know how anyone can stand watching It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia, with this little guy running around, with his high pitched rabbit voice, always excited like he just did an eight ball before every single scene he shoots. It's honestly one of the most annoying things I can think of. This film was kind of lame and leaned toward the stupid side to begin with, but when you add this little squirrel on crack to the mix, it really becomes nearly unwatchable. The bottom line, sequels make money. Some people want to learn the fate of characters they've seen and gotten to know. Then there are people like me, who went to see the first one and even though they weren't crazy about it, figured I might as well go see the next one.
