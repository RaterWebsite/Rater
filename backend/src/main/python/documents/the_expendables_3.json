  "description": "Barney, Christmas and the rest of the team comes face-to-face with Conrad Stonebanks, who years ago co-founded The Expendables with Barney. Stonebanks subsequently became a ruthless arms trader and someone who Barney was forced to kill\u2026 or so he thought. Stonebanks, who eluded death once before, now is making it his mission to end The Expendables -- but Barney has other plans. Barney decides that he has to fight old blood with new blood, and brings in a new era of Expendables team members, recruiting individuals who are younger, faster and more tech-savvy. The latest mission becomes a clash of classic old-school style versus high-tech expertise in the Expendables\u2019 most personal battle yet.",

The main characters developed enough over the first two movies so as to have some backstory, its still fun to see the action stars of my youth teamed up, and the pacing was good.\r The plot is pretty much what you'd expect from an 80's action flick, but that's okay because the movie never billed itself to be anything else.

Suerte que luego el reparto de abuelos arregla el percal y Banderas, porque les das a esos mastuerzos la voz cantante del film y la hunden en la mierda mas inmunda.\r 3-Los Efectos Especiales son UNA PUTA MIERDA, se puede pasar que tenga PG-13, que una parte del reparto sean puro relleno, es hasta soportable.... pero me parece de verg\u00fcenza que los efectos especiales sean una verdadera PORQUER\u00cdA, No solamente ha involucionado en el estilo, sino que encima involuciona visualmente.\r 4-La direcci\u00f3n cae en manos de un pat\u00e1n juntaplanos sin personalidad que esta a las ordenes de lo que le dice Stallone, donde se la machaca con peliculas de la calidad de El Marine o cualquier peli random de Stone Cold Austin. Y que encima va a encargarse del remake americano de The Raid.\r Lo  poco potable, al menos entretiene, ves a gente jugando una partida de Airsoft y ves lo mismo y El Personaje de Antonio Banderas, que me parece el mas divertido del film (Siempre me ha ca\u00eddo bien ese se\u00f1or).\r En Conclusi\u00f3n, ya empiezo a entender de donde han venido las criticas negativas y me parecen muy l\u00f3gicas, Una involuci\u00f3n de la saga, malos FX, y un PG-13 rid\u00edculo. No merece la pena pena pagar por un direct to dvd de tercera regional, cosa que es este film."

      "text": "So really quick, did you catch this in theaters or did you watch it online?\r Stallone and crew (sort of) are back for Expendables 3 and the movie sucks horribly. It's a horrible action movie, it's a horrible Stallone movie, it's a horrible Expendables movie. Ask yourself, \"Why do you like the Expendables?\" Your answer should because it's a movie that brings together the action stars of the 80s and 90s in a explosive, action-fest we've been dreaming about. This movie throws that premise out the window quick and gives you modern action crap that's as dull and boring as modern dramas. We came to see our action favorites battle it out on screen with the bad guys, not a bunch of new nobodies no one cares about. Seriously, they toss out Stallone's team for most of the movie for the sake of introducing a load of new people you won't care about. We even get a VERY dull montage of Stallone picking up the new recruits with Kelsey Grammer's character and this is where the film dies for about 30 minutes. It was so long and boring I had trouble staying awake. We get  2 dull White guys, a girl who looks like a guy and a INCREDIBLY ANNOYING Antonio Banderas to round out the new additions. Really though, why did they make Banderas so F-ing irritating? Speaking of new additions Wesley Snipes, Mel Gibson and Harrison \"I shot first!\" Ford make their Expendables debut. While seeing these guys on screen for this was kinda cool they really didn't do anything, especially Ford who came off as tired and looking bored. I never expected this movie to have Oscar quality acting, but at least give a damn. The action scenes were flashy, although not interesting, seriously how come we went from the gore and guts of Expendables 1 to the no blood and knives in the back crap of Expendables 3. These movies are supposed to be love letters to the action packed movies of a begone era right? So how come they can't get the level of over the top violence right? As far as action movies go this one was bad, real bad. It's a bad action flick and it's a slap in the face to Expendables fans who like/loved the first 2 movies. If this movie were to play on TNT on a Saturday afternoon they wouldn't have to worry about editing anything out. It's that tame. Do yourself a favor and skip this one and hope the 4th one is better."

The plot was extremely weak, chock full of cliches and was completely predictable. I know that's kind of the point with these films, but this one doesn't pull it off well. You always know whats coming next with this film, it doesn't have any surprises or interesting scenes. The actors are far too good for the plot.\r It was also a bad idea reducing the rating to PG-13, I had a bunch of inconsiderate kids in front of me that couldn't stop texting every 5 minutes.

That's basically all there is in terms of plot, despite some dull musings on the frivolity that make little sense in a movie where the body count must come close to the one thousand mark.\r If you've seen either of the first two Expendables movies you'll know exactly what to expect here, namely a bunch of 80's and 90's action stars spouting cheesy one-liners and over the top action sequences. The dialogue is still mostly awful and few of the 'stars' can actually act but when things kick in to gear, such as during the opening train heist or explosive final act, it is undeniably entertaining. In the end it\u2019s not quite as good as the second movie but certainly better than the first and, if you know what you\u2019re getting into, makes for a fairly enjoyable couple of hours."

But that was when it was 15a and 16's.\rNow they decided to make it 12a so that stupid kids can go see another toned sequel to more violent movies. Same thing happened to Die Hard 4 and it's because the studio wanted to make more money.\rThen they decided to bring in the most irritating people to be the next generation of Expendables which completely **** up the whole point of the franchise in the first place. Lutz, Rousey, Powell and Ortiz are all there just to draw in the younger audience but I doubt any kids want to see these idiots, they can't act for **** and there jokes made me want to vomit it was just so painful to listen to them and I wish they could have been killed off but no luck there, the actual Expendables are gone for alot of the movie and we are left with just Stallone for about 45 minutes with the new ones. This really dragged the movie down alot, When the actual ones came back then the film picks up a bit but the final 20 or so minutes are set in a pretty generic abandoned town with tall tower blocks and some tanks, which went on for a while and bored the hell out of me. Another problem for me is that Terry Crews is only in the movie for 5 mins in total which really annoyed me as he was so funny and entertaining the first two and Jet Li just decides to show up right before final fight which was pretty stupid as well with Schwarzenegger who isn't as entertaining as he was in the second movie. The biggest mistake of the movie isnt even the annoying\ryoung actors but the lack of practical effects which were very present in the first two and replaced with digital and cgi explosions which really takes away from the overall effect of the film.\r In short, just kill the series before you can screw it up anymore Stallone but if you must make a fourth movie, just get rid of the annoying kids and go back to practical effects.\rOne last thing Mel Gibson is a terrible villian but Antonio Banderas is THE funniest part of the film."

The film starts out with The Expendables- Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Dolph Lundgren, Kellan Lutz (a new entry) and Yin Yang (Jet Li). They are trying to rescue Wesley Snipes for some reason, I think its because he was a part of The Expendables. The opening scene is fun, it's has great action. And thats what this movie is good about! Action, explosions and Stallone with his deep voice. The characters were great in the previous films, but this movie kind of shows them as grumpy people who just want to kill. Yeah, it could have been improved. Director Patrick Hughes never finds the plot of the film, you are left wondering what happened to that guy or where is that guy gone to. The action is good, plot? Not so much. Mel Gibson, as the villain, was good. The acting is okay, Stallone and supporting are good. TE3 is full of cameos as well. Wow, A LOT of cameos. Well, I can't say it's the best film of the series.

However, that\u2019s not the only thing that makes this movie series interesting\u2014it\u2019s the chance to see a bunch of your favorite (well, if you\u2019re older) childhood movie actors kick-ass. Maybe a \u201cwater-down\u201d Expendables isn\u2019t appealing to some, but for others it lets them see the movie.\r If you haven\u2019t seen The Expendables 1 and 2, you can follow along on the story fine without them. To be blunt and honest, the first two films weren\u2019t too well received by some critics anyway. IMO the plot and story are OK\u2014probably a bit too simple. It\u2019s not the best, but I don\u2019t care about that much anyway. In a similar fashion to the Fast & Furious and Transformers series, I just come to be entertained. I leave my brain at the door, and throw logic out the window. I honestly disagree with the critics over both TMNT and TE3. Both are fun and entertaining, and that\u2019s all I care about. I think the movie is just fun with comedy, crazy action stunts/scenes, and a big cast. It tops absurd action stunt after absurd action stunt.\r One thing I noticed was that most of the characters had weird names: Barney, Christmas, Galgo, Toll Road, Hale Caesar, John Smilee, Mars, Goran Vata, , Max Drummer, and Trench Mauser. But who cares. Most of the cast members were interesting and fun, some more than others. The Expendables 3 has too many cast members, with a bigger focus on the new blood; the younger generation of \u201cThe Expendables\u201d. They\u2019re not horrible, but I care more about old people kicking ass. Most of the younger actors are unfortunately too similar to over-done generic archetypes/stereotypes. We should get to know them better if we\u2019re going to care about them (especially when they get kidnapped in the movie).\r Anyway, too large a cast. The best actors don\u2019t have enough screentime. The plot is too simple (for a team called \u201cThe Expendables\u201d, most of them don\u2019t seem expendable enough to be left behind). However, tanks and explosions and guns and motorcycles and helicopters make it fun enough.\r If you liked this review, read my other ones on movies, TV shows, and videogames. I have reviewed the 2014 films Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Guardians of the Galaxy, Sharknado 2, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Transformers: Age of Extinction, Edge of Tomorrow, X-Men Days of Future Past, Godzilla, Blended, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Transcendence, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, Blended, The Lego Movie, and more. I also review TV shows, such as : TNT\u2019s The Last Ship, Fox's Sleepy Hollow, ABC's Marvel's Agents of SHIELD, CW's The 100, Fox's I Wanna Marry Harry, NBC's Crisis, Fox's Gang Related, and more.\r Good bye! Sincerely, AG732."

      "text": "I was a little bit worried that Stallone would run this series into the ground with this sequel, but surprisingly the large cast is well managed and everybody gets something to do.  The practical effects are refreshing and the action is well choreographed.  The plot while thin is better than the previous two films and is bolstered by Gibson's charismatic performance.  In particular, Banderas, Gibson, and Stallone get a lot of screen time and the characters are more interesting this go round as opposed to Part 2.  It was also refreshing to see Snipes again.  I do not believe the film suffers at all due to a lack of gore and the PG-13 rating makes the film more accessible to a younger audience.  The younger cast do a good job trying to keep pace with the older veterans of the series as well."

      "text": "Basically what you would expect from an Expendables movie. The great cast of action stars team up once again with some new faces and it's a heck of a lot of fun. I gotta give special praise to Wesley Snipes and Kellan Lutz. Snipes character is a blast and Lutz proves he can actually act. I found Banderas to be pretty entertaining as the comic relief character, but others might find his motor-mouth character to be grating. The rest of the newcomers fail to make much of an impression.\r As far as plot goes it's very similar to the second. One of the team gets taken out and Stallone's character is out for revenge. It manages to stay entertaining thanks to Mel Gibson being awesome as the villain. However the plot isn't the appeal of this series. It's seeing the best action stars of the past and present coming together in some crazy awesome action scenes, and there the movie delivers. However it's also directly tied to the movies biggest problem. A lack of urgency.\r There's no real threat to our heroes. Much like in the first two movies you'll watch the team blow through huge amounts of goons while barely taking a scratch. The Expendables? More like the invincibles. Still it's not hard to enjoy all the explosions and gunfire, especially when they're delivered with humor and a tongue-in-cheek style like they are here.\r It's an entertaining movie. One that benefits greatly from it's plethora of great stars. It might be the weakest in the series, but it's got enough fun to entertain action movie fans. I give it a 7.5/10."

      "text": "You never look at a movie review on metacritic. No point. The critics are **** who don't appreciate the great 80's style movies, like this one. The plot is good, maybe needed a little work, the acting is fantastic, and the choreographed action blows your mind. Unfortunately, it WAS an 18 (a lot of blood, violence, gore) but it had to be cut down to a 12A. Of course, the version with the violence would have been better.\r People who say there is 'dull action sequences'. Watch the film first, please, instead of being a pet dog to the critics. Anyway, here is the point. The Expendables 1. Ok. The Expendables 2. Brilliant. The Expendables 3. Fantastic. The films seem to get better and better as they go on.\r Now stop wasting your time looking at crooked and brain-dead reviews, watch the damn film!\r Arnold Schwarzenegger: Let's GET TO THE CHAPPA!.\r 10/10. **** the critics."

This movie is as good as a shoot em up as it gets. All the one liners are still in tact. There is a reasonable amount of comedy in the mix. Antonio Banderas was hilarious which I didn't expect in this one. I'm hoping Stallone gears up for the 4th because I'm in!"

Mais um filme da franquia \"Expendables\" do mestre Stallone. A ideia de reviver todo o esp\u00edrito dos filmes de a\u00e7\u00e3o dos anos 80/90 \u00e9 incr\u00edvel. Quem diria que vir\u00edamos Stallone lada a lado com Schwarzenegger?? Enfim, os pontos negativos desse terceiro filme s\u00e3o: A hist\u00f3ria, que \u00e9 muito fraca. E a classifica\u00e7\u00e3o PG13, que visivelmente fez muito mal ao filme! Entretanto o filme \u00e9 divertido, as adi\u00e7\u00f5es dos \"atores\" novos passa despercebido em meio aos cl\u00e1ssicos atores antigos que todo mundo ama. O destaque fica realmente para excelente interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o de Antonio Banderas, o insano Wesley Snipes e o incr\u00edvel vil\u00e3o interpretado pelo Mel Gibson!!! O filme n\u00e3o \u00e9 nenhum espet\u00e1culo, sendo o mais fraco da franquia. Mas de qualquer forma, \u00e9 legal, divertido, e vale a pena ser visto, sem grandes expectativas. A sequ\u00eancia final de a\u00e7\u00e3o e tamb\u00e9m o fato de poder ver novamente todo o pessoal reunido, e agora com Jet Li de volta e atores que n\u00e3o vimos em cena h\u00e1 algum tempo, como Antonio Banderas, Wesley Snipes, Mel Gibson e o grande Harrison Ford, fazem a experiencia valer a pena!! Que venha o \"The Expendables 4\", quem sabe com o GRANDE Clint Eastwood e com o Steven Seagal!!! Sera \u00e9pico!!"

The third in the series is way better than the second instalment, having regained its sense of humour, and the addition of more big name stars ups the fun factor, but it still feels like a missed opportunity. Antonio Banderas however deserves a spin off of his own!"

      "text": "I felt that the Expendables 3 should've stick back to its R-rated form filled with all but blood, gore, more violence and some cheesey 80's one-liners. But this year, I kinda lost touch with the 3rd movie. The first 2 was beyond awesome showcasing 80's and 90's action gems into nothing more than a testosterone Rambo meets Road House-style nostalgic reminisce of kick-ass guns blazing action. The 3rd, however, is kinda dumb and not in a good way. For starters, the new cast is weak (except \"Rowdy\" Ronda Rousey, the first female UFC women's champion, she did a great job in her first acting role) because I don't know why who told it would be a great idea to add an action nobody Kellan Lutz (from the crappy Legend of Hercules), an MMA legend (Victor Ortiz), the actor from \"The Goonies,\" and an unknown actor (Glen Powell) to be in the list of weared-down action heroes. The action scenes were almost as good as usual, but they toned down the violence and the blood that was supposed to be covered were dreadful. The script is lackluster at best, character conversations feels like Love Connection, there's no Jet Li on it, and But the biggest problem is that they make an excuse to make this an unnecessary PG-13 rating to aim less on mature audiences an drew at kids and parents as well. Adding insult to injury, it was the piracy to blame for this one-note joke of a sometimes almost good sequel. Maybe the studio just thought about this to happen once it was released three weeks before the movie even have to wait to buy it on DVD once the movie's run in the theater is over. And that's leading to the supposed downfall of The Expendables. I know they're making a 4th film soon, but can they just end the series right about now? I'm not saying the movie is terrible and all, but my only concern is Arnie and Sly's action movie status. I think it's about time they should hang it up and retire because there's not much left for the fans what they want in a action movie."
