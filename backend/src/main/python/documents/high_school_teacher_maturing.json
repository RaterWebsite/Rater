      "text": "The setup is nuts, and I love it.  It does go into a slightly different direction than you'd expect, showing a smidge more dopey behavior from the teachers than the kids, and the movie is funnier for it.    Every joke hits its mark, and lines are delivered rapid-fire style.  I  consider myself harsh when it comes to comedy, but High School had me in stitches.    Bush and Marquette play off one another, each showing comedic timing in back-and-forth dialog, and they make a good team.  I couldn't even recognize Michael Chiklis as the principal, and he has some funny moments himself.  The film has a smooth but lively music video feel that should appeal to a young audience, and scenes move along briskly.    If you liked Project X, you'll love High School.  Full review on my blog."

Sean Marquette and Matt Bush made a great duo. It reminded me a lot of Project X, so if you liked that movie you should like this one."
