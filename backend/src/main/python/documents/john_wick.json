I liked the parts where it showed the code of honor among bad people, like the membership in some kind of pleasure hotel, where when you break the rules you're dead. It appears there are bad people have honor, and of course, those that don't. The best part is Keneau Reeves. He gives the proper intensity and he's back to his Matrix moves. Damn he looks good for 50 years old! We need to send The Equalizer, John Wicks and Liam Neeson's characters to fight Issis and make this a better world."

      "text": "The very first scene of Chad Stahelski's 'John Wick' depicts the title character portrayed by Keanu Reeves severely hurt, not even being able to stand. The first thing he does, though, is not attempt to ease his wounds, but rather take out his phone and watch a video of a girl on the beach. We later learn that was his wife, which died from an incurable disease and the man in question is probably one of the most feared and respected hitmen.The premise of this film is that his wife leaves him a dog as present for him which is killed by a naive mobster's son just for fun so he can steal Wick's car. After that, we have the classic hero looking for revenge. But unlike most films, 'John Wick' offers a fresh premise, with the dog representing the last thing left for him by his wife, almost like a child, if you wish. More so, it offers some brilliantly directed and choreographed action scenes which flow perfectly and a soundtrack which is booming and dangerous.So, this is a pretty cool film. It has the makings of greatness, but unfortunately there are some issues in controlling these elements. First of all, there are occasional awkward pacing issues, and also sometimes the film ditches its somber soundtrack for generic 'cool' pop-rock singles which are inappropriate. The character of John Wick himself is rather dull and emotionless (apart for his feelings of sadness and vengeance) although I tend to believe this was done on purpose. What is better is the way in which the main villain, mob leader Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist) is presented. He develops a fascination for Wick and his skills and determination, even though sometimes he seems a bit cartoonish.Another great thing is the way in which John Wick is referred to as an unstoppable and feared hitman, almost like a supernatural being. The action scenes though, are perfectly balanced, realistic and by the end of the film Wick is bruised and beaten... but he survives. It is this perseverance which makes him truly powerful, but more so, he seems to be the only man which has true friends in the cold Mafia underworld, like Marcus (Willem Dafoe) who had many chances of killing him but could not do it.In the end, 'John Wick' is a slick, dark and stylish action flick which despite a few awkward and overly dramatized moments offers one of the best, brutal and elegant fighting dynamics."

The movie ends with John nearly dying and gets himself a new dog.Also, the gore in the movie was awesome  and didnt really seem out of place.Just pure unesecary but awesome gore.This film defies our expectations for an action film as it doesnt hVe the clich\u00e9 plot of the very typical \u201chuehe lets save the world guys!\u2019 , but it has a very different story.The whole movie happens because this russian guy from John\u2019s former crew kills his dog which was John\u2019s wife\u2019s last present to him.Not onlh that but the dude straight up steals his car.This kovie is driven by revenge.Literally the whole movie is just about John getting revenge on basically everyone that did wrong to him."

Combining the Hong Kong action style with American neo-noir, John Wick has strong visual similarities to The Matrix and Oldboy. Keanu Reeves demonstrates once again his deep affection for action choreography with an outstanding stunt crew. The action covers gunplay, martial arts, muscle cars, and good-old street brawling. The plot even makes sense - something you wouldn't expect from such an intense action-driven film.There is so much to love about this film. Truly one of the greats and a testament to Keanu's dedication and hard work; he surrounds himself with talented directors, designers, camera crews and stunt crews, and these perfect films are the result."

This film is a CV to the future Matrix trilogy. It is also a thank you letter to wachowski.

      "text": "Very stylish film with good close combat action sequences (and some vehicle action). Villain is made to be fairly realistic and mortal, more so than John Wick, which is a nice change as these types of films often make the villains seem unrealistically bad. There's subtle dark humor mixed in throughout the film. Negatives, biggest is the large contrast of dialogue volume to music and sound effects, at least on a standard TV (may be better with an external sound system). You will need the remote, trust me. You also just have to accept it's unrealistic like many action films with the main character seeming to be invincible (though constantly getting beat up and seeming on the verge of death). The premise is borderline absurd though it's likely intentional, that he takes down a massive NYC crime mob all on his own because the son of the mob leader killed his dog and stole his car (why is explained as the film goes on, trying to avoid spoilers here). Could use more variety in the action, most of it is indoor gun shootouts, him versus 50 mob people several times (how big is this mob anyway? law enforcement has really failed if they've allowed something this big to develop). His dialogue is intentionally minimal but when he does speak, sometimes it comes off a bit corny and he has one mood / demeanor the entire film with a few exceptions (again, that likely isn't an oversight but what they wanted). Soundtrack is okay, may have been better without some of the alt-rock songs, not sure."

They killed his puppy! Think for micro second.. John Wick probably did worse than that before he fell in love and left the crime world in order to live the good life from all of his ill begotten riches.Coupled with absolutely no other true character development and for what of that there is, it takes a back seat to the non stop MATRIX LIKE hand to hand battle sequences that make up 95% of the film. Isn't that nice of Hollywood to develop a series of films where Keanu Reeves doesn't have to act and involves almost identical battle sequences using his skillset that he had previously learned for The Matrix trilogy.. hmmmm things that make you go hmmmm.... at least the matrix had an interesting and way more complex storyline to frame the action sequences in it. This film is extremely unsophisticated REVENGE PORN. How ever polished it may be."

      "text": "I would give this film about an 8.5, but it gets bumped up to nine for the impact it has had on action cinema. This film came along at a time when action films were suffering deeply and showed them all how it\u2019s done. The home invasion sequence and the Red Circle shootout are some of the best action sequences of the last decade. But the action of this film isn\u2019t all it has to offer; it goes above and beyond what an action movie is called for by setting up an entire underworld of assassins that... it\u2019s just so cool. The premise is extremely simple yet ruthlessly effective because of its setup, and of course; Keanu. F#cking. Reeves. His dedication to his craft gives these movies a passion that otherwise wouldn\u2019t exist, and he even manages to pull out a decent performances in the quieter moments. (As much as I love Keanu, his acting ability isn\u2019t what makes him so awesome). Unfortunately, the movie definitely peaks in its first two acts; after John achieves his goal, there isn\u2019t much that tops that intensity. I mean, Wick takes on entire squads of trained henchman with ruthless efficiency and the final battle of this film is an old, out of shape Russian gangster that manages to get the closest to killing John that anyone has? Yeah, I don\u2019t buy it. But an underwhelming finale is the only real knock against this film, it\u2019s still an excellent piece of action cinema."

I mean, think about it, if you were to listen to a pitch for a movie that was based around a former assassin who goes on a killing spree because his dog got killed...you probably wouldn't have high hopes for the movie. But, John Wick is about as good as it could possibly be. The action sequences are simply some of the most entertaining I've seen in the many movies I've seen. The world itself is also very interesting, and I'm looking forward to seeing the spinoff TV show about the hotel if it ever comes to fruition. There are some cheesy moments, and the story is pretty typical for an action film in the end, but it blew away my expectations when I saw it back in 2014 and I still enjoy watching it to this day."

      "text": "John Wick PvC Review (5/25/19)ProsComing from an honest, emotional approach; John Wick lays down the groundwork for an enthralling world of assassins in a way that is completely unique from other movies like it. Witnessing a grieving man try to move on in his life only to witness him being dragged back into his past that he fought to escape, to find out that he is in fact a trained killer and the best of them all. You explore his dark past with him, you see this world that seems to be grounded in reality but is so surreal in its own right and you naturally learn its rules as well as its figures. I think that\u2019s what I love best about this film, it\u2019s not all the high octane action but the cleverly written world it is presenting before me. But needless to say the action does shine a lot; it is quite beautifully done thanks to Keanu Reeves\u2019 knowledge of the stunts performed, the shots done with the camera, and the way the music compliments it to its fullest extent without missing a beat. But it is also the action that can hold it back for me. + Enthralling world+ Intriguing characters and narrative+ Fantastic soundtrack+ Good Action+ Naturally paced story and progression+ Beautifully shotConsIn this story you follow John Wick as he seeks revenge against the people who took away the rest of his normal life, hence making it an intriguing vengeance story, but the payoff of actually him getting his man for both occasions just doesn\u2019t feel gratifying or it feels too quick to make it satisfying. Also in terms of the action scenes, while really fast paced and entertaining to watch, I found myself growing less interested in the typical cover shooting gun fights along with the settings they took place in. It felt too typical of a movie of its genre at times when it could\u2019ve done so much more in the world that they had beautifully created. Maybe it was the praise the movie had received that made me feel a bit let down with some of the action segments or the fact that the fights got a bit samey towards the end. Regardless of this, it doesn\u2019t hold the movie back from being great. It was just a bit disappointing in some of its aspects.- Payoff isn\u2019t all there- Action can be a bit disappointing at timesOverallJohn Wick is a fantastic action flick with a genuinely intriguing world and with genuinely wonderful characters that feel natural to it. While some things are a bit disappointing it doesn\u2019t take away the fact that this is a wonderfully entertaining film."
