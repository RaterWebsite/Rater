You can not paint a character to hate something the entire movie (her entire life) and then change that character completely at the end to fit your story arc.

My only gripe is that it probably should have been a standard 90-95 minute run time instead of 110 or so as it is. ***Minor spoilers*** This movie has convincing and disturbing portrayals of family violence, anger, discord and fear. You may get upset if you've experienced these things in your own life because these are very accurate depictions of children in fear of their own parents. Otherwise the scares are there and this is a seriously malevolent entity that destroys lives at its leisure. The pace is deliberate, the gore is judicious, and the ending banishes all hope of happiness."

As the story progresses the two story lines become more and more intertwined and the resulting film is an often creepy and scary as it unfolds from the eyes of this girl and boy both as children and grown to adulthood. It centers around a haunted mirror whose influence affects all around it. Seamless transitions from one time to the next keep you on the edge of your seat and the whole time the mirror has us doubting our own eyes. Horror done well with excellent performances all around.

      "text": "It is often said that a mirror offers not only a reflection of one\u2019s own physical being, but also a reflection of their soul. The eyes meanwhile are far more subjective, being connected to the human brain which may lie to us more times than we would like to believe. When the physical frame can corrupt the mental existence so easily, how are we truly able to discern between the truth and the false truth. That is precisely what Mike Flanagan explores in his feature-length directorial debut.\r Oculus is a supernatural / psychological horror starring Karen Gillan of Doctor Who fame and adapted from Flanagan\u2019s popular short film Oculus: Chapter 3 \u2013 The Man With The Plan. The story begins in 2002 with the Russell family as brother and sister Tim (Brenton Thwaites) and Kaylie (Karen Gillan) try to escape their family after he had killed their mother. We then jump ahead 11 years where we learn that Tim had shot his father and has since been in an Institution. On the day of his release his sister greets him only to announce that she bought \u2018it\u2019 and expects him to keep his promise to kill \u2018it\u2019. The \u2018it\u2019 in question is revealed to be a large antique mirror. After years of clinical supervision Tim has grown to accept the incident on logical and psychological terms. Kaylie however sternly refutes that their father was not to blame and that it was in fact a supernatural phenomenon courtesy of the mirror. Reluctantly, Tim follows his sister back to their old family home where Kaylie has set up an intricate experiment to prove once and for all that the mirror is evil.\r What follows is a run-through of the long list of horrific scenarios each of the mirror\u2019s owners faced, dating back to the 1700s, along with a detailed series of precautions Kaylie has in placed in order to keep the pair from falling too deep into the abyss. You see the primary and unique danger that the mirror seemingly presents is that, as the advertising tagline states, \u2018you see what it wants you to see\u2019. For instance, upon biting into an apple, Kaylee ends up pulling shards of a light bulb from her mouth, only afterward to be met with concerned looks from her brother as she has been painfully spitting out mere slices of apple. The rest of the plot is unravelled as the pair attempt to survive in the house whilst reliving their childhood memories of the original event. The juxtaposition of both stories are weaved neatly together in a very smart narrative that constantly places the audience in the same situation as the two leads. It is believed that the mirror causes plants to die and animals to disappear. And yet both are seemingly explained; cameras show Tim and Karen moving the plants, and whilst Karen remembers their pet dog having suddenly disappeared whilst trapped with the mirror, Tim recalls their parents discussing it had to be put down whilst at the doctors. The viewer soon follows this train of thought by their own accord. As children they seemingly could not destroy the mirror, and now they are reluctant to do so without proving its power first. Perhaps this is indeed due to an unspeakable force, or it is simply their refusal to eradicate a symbol of their helplessness when faced with such a traumatic event. Only the viewer can truly decide what to make of the events that unfold.\r In the aftermath of Paranormal Activity, the director of Oculus was initially approached by many studios who wished to turn the project into a found footage movie. Flanagan outright refused and only accepted Intrepid Pictures\u2019 offer under the obligation that it was not found footage. The end result is something of a double-edged sword. On the one hand it lacks what many modern horror audiences love: jump scares and gore. The only element of any noticeable comparison to popular horror films nowadays such as Insidious and Paranormal Activity are the odd humanoid apparitions adorned with glowing eyes. Personally, I found these \u2018ghouls\u2019 to be the only notable fault of the film as they simply something we\u2019ve all seen before and not presented in any particularly unique sense. They are simply there to bring in the punters and deliver the odd attempt at being \u2018scary\u2019. However the other side to Oculus is what prevails and truly works in this critic\u2019s opinion. The plot, consisting of two interesting stories, is notched up to eleven thanks to an intelligent script that delivers enthralling dialogue, enhanced by the charismatic and somewhat disturbing Gillan, and a slow-burn pace that sucks the viewer in until they soon realise just how deep they have gotten, attempting to figure out just where they are within the timelines and just what is really happening.\rIn avoiding cheap shots and shock value we instead we receive a traditional horror film that harks back to the simpler times - Full Review @ItsMuchMore"

      "text": "\"Oculus\" 10 Scale Rating: 8.0 (Great) ...\r The Good: The best thing about this film is that there is little to no gore in it, yet it gets it's point across. Sufficiently creepy, \"Oculus\" is a creative and well written tale that retains your interest throughout. While Karen Gillan and Brenton Thwaites were more than adequate, the best performances of the film featured Rory Cochran and Katee Sackhoff in flashback sequences. The pair played the parents of the lead characters and help fill in the blanks as to what makes the cursed mirror (the central point of the film) so important. While it won't truly scare you (but what does these days?), it is a well done and entertaining movie with a very satisfying ending.\r The Bad: While it doesn't detract too much from the film, it does rely on the typically \"jumpy\" scenes here and there. I understand the point, but could have done without them. Gillan eventually settles into the role, but is a little awkward and somewhat annoying early on."

I thought the film was well-acted, but the plot was not very strong and sometimes the action was much too hectic. I was not bored, but the film did not deliver the scares than some less well-made and original horror films do (example: The Purge). Sinister, which I think is a far better film than Oculus, is both well-made and delivers more shocks and shivers, even when I\u2019ve watched it a several  times on cable (without commercials) after seeing it in the theater. So I would say Oculus is an interesting film for horror fans like myself to see once, but it is not very memorable and I guessed the ending long before the end of the film."

Wow, were they powerful. The trailer for this film makes it look just like every other of these creepy, gothic-style films from the last couple of years, but it's got a stripped down, clean feel to it that makes it unique and justifies the metascore.

I felt that the movie started out slow, I remember it being an hour into the film and I was sitting there bored waiting for the story to build. In my personal opinion, it wasn't a scary movie. I felt the movie was more of a suspense or thriller, but it WAS NOT scary. The whole first hour of the film is the dad being an **** the mom being insecure, and the kids continually crying. And when they finally start to show some creepy stuff, its near the end at that point, and because the build up was so slow, my excitement was already completely gone by the time it got a little creepy. I felt that the creepiness they added, was there just to be there, it didn't really add to the story. The greatest part about the end of the movie is that it was finally over. The film was well shot, and they had great actors, but my main problem is that the story sucked, and it didn't truly feel like a scary movie, because it simply wasn't scary. They had random moments of silence where something would jump out or scream to catch you off guard, but it wasn't done in a way that made you feel scared.

      "text": "Director Mike Flanagan and co-writer Jeff Howard expand on their original 30-minute short film about a lethal piece of furniture \"Oculus: Chapter 3\" to a feature-length film. While it's a cut above the usual paranormal thriller, its 105 minute runtime doesn't dramatically improve on its mysterious element and it falls short on dread and tension. While \"Oculus\" slowly develops an unsettling story that cleverly undermines an age-old horror-film clich\u00e9, it's never quite as scary or as memorable as one might have hoped.\r After shooting his father and spending years in psychiatric care, Tim Russell (Brenton Thwaites), reunites with his sister Kaylie (Karen Gillan), who claims that an antique mirror in their father's study was what destroyed their family, as well as the families of many owners before them. Tim reluctantly agrees to help Kaylie document the mirror's effects, but all goes awry when it begins to play with their perceptions-intermingling past and present, memory and reality, and forcing them to witness again their parents' violent relationship, with devastating results.\r What's unique about \"Oculus\" is its structure, which cuts back and forth between Tim and Kaylie in 2012 and their experiences 10 years earlier. Flanagan daringly cross cuts between flashbacks and the present, and even sometimes unities the two storylines in the same shot. Flanagan uses the back story to inform the audience of the details of how this started, while at the same time using it to terrorize Tim and Kaylie, who aren't quite sure if what they are seeing -- and doing -- is real or not.\r Flanagan creates a number of eerie visual parallels between the past and present, but eventually the slow-burn suspense sequences and sudden shocks become increasingly repetitive. Throughout the film's slow build-up, Flanagan effectively incorporates some creepy images and the film convincingly earns its frights the old-fashioned way. However, the third act offers an escalation in action accompanied with a scene of shock that doesn't intensify or enhance its predictable, lackluster finale. To his credit, Flanagan takes a dubious premise further than most could. That being said, next time just smash the damn mirror."

The movie has a strong impact if you suspend the expectation to be scared and shocked because it simply doesn't do that.\r Why is that? Because you catch on rather quickly that most of the movie is an illusion. The two main characters are reliving the trauma of their past in real time rather than flashing back to it. The director makes this perfectly obvious by interleaving the past and present, having the past versions of the characters occupy the same space and time as the adult characters. As a result, you realize you can't really believe anything you are seeing and fear arises from what we believe to be real not what we don't. There are a few of those jump out of your skin moments but they are entirely predictable as in someone turns around slowly and 7 Days chic is standing there - meh.\r The story though was heart-wrenching. You have boy, Tim, who inadvertently kills his father and (SPOILER ALERT) sister Kaylee because of this mirror thing from hell. A family is torn apart methodically by a sinister and malevolent force that has killed many others before. The scene at the end sticks in my mind like retina burn from an arc welder; Tim furiously pleading \"It was the mirror\" as he is driven away in a police cruiser and his sister materializing with the signature chromed eyes of the mirror's victims next to his parents with the same telltale trait in the window of the family's old house. Its at the moment when it really sinks in \"Holy sh**, he actually killed his sister, he's the only one of his family still alive, he's going away to the big house, and no one will ever believe it wasn't his fault.\" No happy ending here.
