The music was fantastic and even moving at one point, the special effects were good and the way that they built a huge set that looked realistic and like the real Air Force One was also great!!\rThe acting in this film was phenomenal also. Harrison Ford portrayed a heroic President and father brilliantly and the punchline \"Get off my plane\" was executed well also. Gary Oldman showed his character's malice perfectly also and his accent was awesome.\rOverall Air Force One was a fantastic film which was thrilling, action-packed and moving at times and it also opened up some secrets of Air Force One, even if it was not entirely acurrate. A great film nonetheless."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "\"Air Force One\" is a good summer blockbuster to watch, especially for the America-obsessed patriots who love watching good Mr. American President kicking bad, grumpy terrorist asses.

Talk about backsliding."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Air Force One is a successful thriller on a plane. Harrison Ford plays the president with such conviction that the movie soars (no pun intended). Oldman makes a hell of an antagonist as well. This film will keep you thoroughly entertained."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Its the perfect action with the right amount of danger! However, its Rated R for Violence even though it should have been rated PG-13 for intense action violence and brief strong language."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Thrilling. Still, it's kinda funny, making Harrison Ford president."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "One thing I've noticed that Air Force One really hammered home for me is that Wolfgang Petersen really doesn't do subtle. From the over-the-top action, to the cheesy dialogue that is delivered by actors with a completely straight face and the lengthy set-pieces, everything is designed with no-nonsense thrills in mind. There's no real agenda behind the film as far as I can tell, it was made too late and loaded with too many archaic and fantastical views to say anything about even the Cold War, let alone the modern world. Jerry Goldsmith's score is also instantly noticeable, not for its quality as such, but because it's invasive, bordering on jarring. The central plot of the film could be quite terrifying, especially to a modern audience, but the story takes you to such ludicrous extremes that it threatens to become parody. The cast's performances are largely unremarkable, particularly (and rather disappointingly) Ford's action-hero president. The only actors that really stand out are Gary Oldman (who looks like he was having so much fun with the role) and Glenn Close, who valiantly appears to be attempting to bring the film back to some form of reality. Despite its problems, if you watch it in the right frame of mind (preferably with a beer in hand and with the company of a few friends) you can have a lot of fun watching Air Force One. It's pure, unashamed escapism."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "While entirely unbelievable and full to the brim of plot holes, Air Force One still flies high thanks to its ability to create tension so high people with pacemakers probably shouldn't watch it.The first 30 minutes of the film are the most thrilling with a engrossing opening to the extremely manic hijacking everything is done to build tension and the film doesn't miss a beat with it seamlessly cutting from  the plane, to the ground and to the White House. The characters are introduced quickly to avoid losing momentum but writer Andrew Marlowe gives enough for viewers to relate and empathise with them. The film understandably lags after the initial action but this is beneficial as it allows for Gary Oldman to do what he does best, be menacing. The casting of the film is one of the main draws with Harrison Ford providing his usual gritty performance and Oldman rivaling Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber but it would be nice to see other fine actors such as William H Macy, Paul Guilfoyle and Xander Berkeley given more to do. The main flaw of Air Force One is that its ending, which should be the climax of all the tension comes too early with the real ending being not nearly as tense. In summary if you like the idea of Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman playing cat and mouse in an enclosed space 40,000 feet  in the air than this film is for you. Lovingly put together by Wolfgang Petersen, a real crowd pleaser."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "I've seen many movies but Air Force One is still one of my favorite suspense movies.

Pretty good action film."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "In 2013 we had Die Hard in the White House in 1997 we had Die Hard on a plane. President Marshall played well but straightforwardly by Harrison Ford is on Air Force One flying from Russia to America when Gary Oldman and his gun wielding friends take the plane hostage demanding that a war criminal is released from prison. Oldman is undoubtedly the best thing about the movie, he gives the only above average performance in 2 hours of scenes best described as \"decent\". Much like the only good Michael Bay movie ever The Rock, you will enjoy Air Force One as long as you are prepared for how dumb it is. The CGI is terrible, the story is thin, every time someone is killed there is a cheesy one liner, the soundtrack is typically reminiscent of the American National Anthem and so inspirational it's cliched. But Air Force One is an enjoyable and fun action movie, perfect to watch with friends and lots of popcorn. Not really worth a watch unless you're an action junkie (which I'm not) but dumb fun if you do give it a try."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Violent without windings, a good action movie Die Hard-style, but in the Presidential Range, some people will think it illogical nonsense and bad, but apart from the fact that the president be Indiana Jones, the movie is acceptable"}, {"rating": "2", "text": "What a ridiculous US propaganda full of political correct dialogues.

Wolfgang Peterson; a critically acclaimed director, fails on all levels here and addition to that, dims the somewhat appreciable script written by Andrew W. Marlowe. Harrison Ford might be suitable to portray such character but he needed to work hard on it like his supporting actor Gary Oldman that completely overpowers him on screen. Air Force One is a mere action feature whose attempt to reach for something more and beyond its potential eventually turns itself being intangible to the set tone."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "This action film focuses on the figure of the US president and his private airplane, Air Force One, which is abducted by politically motivated air pirates, willing to kill everything and everyone to liberate a dictator from Eastern Europe. Of course the film is a copious rain of US imperialist propaganda, with the US being the \"world police\" and champion of democracy. Despite all this, it is a good action movie, although there are already so many action movies on planes that ends up bringing nothing new other than the propaganda. The scenes in the presidential crisis cabinet are much more interesting than the scenes on the plane, with the several hesitations and fears of the presidential staff jumping into the public's eyes. These scenes greatly help the audience to get into the mood and get carried away by what they see. The end of the film lacks credibility and ends up implausible. Harrison Ford did a good job but reminds us a bit of other action movies where he shined, so it's not surprising. Gary Oldman did very well, almost stealing the scene from Harrison Ford. The worst of his interpretation is a fake Russian accent that makes the character a bit ridiculous. Glenn Close also does a good job, in a secondary character that ends up having some centrality in the plot. All the rest, unfortunately, is US self-praise."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "well choreographed crap...Liam..hang your head in shame.
