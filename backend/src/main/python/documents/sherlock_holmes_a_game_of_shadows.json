Critic response hasnt been very positive, so I expected some level of disappointment, but I left disappointed in the lack of praise this movie has received.  The cast is downright perfect, as it was the last time, but what improved this version over the extremely wonderful predecessor was the extensive insight into Sherlock's detective mind, something I considered lacking in the original.  The relationship between Holmes and Watson was more deeply built, as was Holmes' relationship with his adversary.  Moriarty was a perfect counterpart and a joy to finally see on screen.  Other than the length, I have very, very little criticism of this intellectually stimulating, action-packed feast for the senses.  The getaway scene from the armory was enough to praise Ritchie, and this is coming from a not-so-interested-in-action-movies kind of guy.  Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is a masterpiece in a genere not often represented or respected."

There are some charming moments but for the most part Sherlock 2 was underwhelming. I recommend Sherlock 2 if you liked the first movie but don't expect too much as its only ok and is not too memorable."

It was fun to watch, but silly. Downey Jr. is a genius of an actor, and the saving grace of this movie. He manages to salvage something positive from this messy film."

This movie is about entertainment and not much more. Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law perform their parts very well as Sherlock and Watson. I would rate the movie more highly but I think that it could use some tightening in its plot. Nonetheless, the bedlam of the action sequences married to the erudition of the movie's wit make for good cinema."

      "text": "An awesome movie - Sherlock Holmes has the ability to keep you at the edge of its seat with its extreme unpredictability. Not so much that you lose control of the plot and you just sit there looking puzzled and confused, but to keep you intrigued of what might happen next. It's one of those movies that actually makes you think - you yourself may have turned into a Sherlock Holmes unravelling the mystery of what both Sherlock and Dr. Watson are solving. So much darker and creepier tale - but is still enjoyable for the imminent teens because it does not make them feel stupid, but neither is it too much for them. This movie also goes deeper into Sherlock's and Watson's relationship, I think they make such a good team, so funny, so brilliant, like there's an unbreakable bond between them. It still manages to pull off an excellent line of gags - I laughed and laughed so much I wished I could laugh at it all over again when it finished because it was so hilarious. One unmissable moment involves a man and some drag, and don't forget to look out for the surprise ending, which fascinated and entertained for what might come next. It achieves both sides - its technical side is perfection, and the literary and artistic skills don't come amiss, unlike some movies nowadays. And this is what I call a real movie, and a really good sequel to what came before.  A thrill ride of a movie taking you from one place to another - miss this and you miss the biggest and best rollercoaster of your life. The critics certainly don't know what they're missing - don't even believe one word of what they're saying - see this and be overjoyed that you did listen to common sense."

Alot of people don't like the Sherlock homes movies because they are not true to the book. I think that it is a great adaptation, and it was very well done.

Its slow start is however made up by what follows- the antagonist in the form of professor James Moriarty is a brilliant match against Sherlock and the banter and a clever game of cat and mouse is outstanding between them. The action set pieces are amazing including a train and a breathtaking slow motion escape through a forest  that is that good you can hardly breathe. The films ending however is clearly the best aspect of the film in which an outstanding showdown between the professor and Sherlock takes place over a physical and somewhat metaphorical game of chess. While the film starts not its does find its steam and from then on never fails impress and amaze."

I found it hilariously funny, very gripping and despite what some might say about Holmes being too much of an action man - it is faithful to the original character. He was never supposed to be a sleuth, sitting at home solving mysteries. He only lounged at home in between cases - never by choice. Holmes always was a man of action. In Conan-doyles books he took part in high speed chases, firefights and all sorts. Ok so he never pumelled the hell out of anyone with his bare hands - but I always felt that he should - seeing as he was an accomplished boxer. Anyway - the user reviews are much more in line with how the film actually plays. Most of the critics who say the film isn't faithful to the original text have never even read holmes."

Game of Shadows is really the same movie as the first: an extremely Hollywoodized, action-oriented take on the classic detective. While the first was fairly enjoyable, with a great performance by Downey Jr., this one has scrapped any mystery whatsoever in favor of a Victorian era, Steam Punk actioner. There is a bit of redemption however, with the last twenty-five minutes to half an hour being intense and fairly clever, as well as some decent action sequences. It doesn't exactly outweigh the awful performance by Stephen Fry or the fact that Robert Downey has now worked all originality or quirkiness in his character to death. And of course, the upsetting fact that they set it up for a third movie."

Here we have two great actors in Robert Downey, JR and Jude Law and the result is a TV miniseries.

Ritchie would have done himself some good if he had laid the foundation for that rivalry. In addition, Law is not that good at being the straight man to Holmes. Law could have been left out of the film and I would not have noticed. Lastly, is Ritchie turning Moriarty into the a Bond super villain?  Let's hope not as that is what destroyed that series."

I admire his visual style, but there was too much distracting slow motion and super fast word play between all the characters.  I still have the same problem as I had in the first film about turning Holmes into a kung fu fighting super hero, but Hollywood has decided the average movie-goer in America has the attention span of a mosquito so the more action the better.  They also threw a woman in the film for no reason, she is absolutely wasted.  Still, Robert Downing Jr. and Jude Law do have a chemistry, there are some laughs, and a lot of action.

      "text": "The second installment in Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes franchise is more action-packed than the first, and is just as funny. It's also on a far grander scale, as the great detective launches into a game of wits with his arch-nemesis Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris in a piece of perfect casting). Whilst the stakes have been increased, and there are a good deal more explosions this time round, A Game of Shadows has lost a lot of the charm the first film had. Robert Downey, Jr. has well and truly grown into his role - in the first film it felt like he was finding his feet, discovering who the character of Holmes really was, but this time round he is completely certain of himself, and his incarnation of the iconic literary character is mesmerising. As previously mentioned, Jared Harris makes the perfect Moriarty, both believable as an academic and as a criminal mastermind, and always menacing, and the scenes of \"intellectual fistycuffs\" between Holmes and Moriarty are without doubt the highlight of the film. Unfortunately Jude Law's Dr. Watson is now a little dull. In the first film he was essential to Holmes' investigations, serving as a combination of best friend, carer and bodyguard, but this time round he seems to have been brought along for the ride as an afterthought. He serves little purpose other than running around and firing the odd shot while Holmes works everything out. He's now just a big moving target with a moustache for evil henchmen to shoot at. And Jude Law forgets his character's limp on an alarmingly frequent basis. The relationship between Holmes and Watson has also devolved from an amusing \"bromance\" into full-blown homo-eroticism. Other characters from the first film aren't given the screen-time they deserve - Rachel McAdams' Irene Adler gets a couple of short scenes, and if you blink you'll miss Eddie Marsan's Inspector Lestrade. The performances of series newcomers Noomi Rapace and Stephen Fry are both competent but uninspiring. The main problem with the story of A Game of Shadows is not that it's uninventive and predictable (which it is), but that the pace is inconsistent - alternating between complex action scenes and quieter moments where Holmes tries to figure out exactly what is going on results in the story having a rather jarring stop-start feel. In addition, because of the excessive use of innuendo, sometimes the film resembles a Carry On! a little too closely. Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is still entertaining for the most part, and has great performances from Robert Downey, Jr. and Jared Harris, but a combination of reduced roles for some central characters, uneven pacing and some laughable double entendre makes the film far less than it might be. Here's hoping these problems will be addressed in the sequel that will undoubtedly appear at some point in the near future."

The supporting actors are once again excellent except for Noomi Rapace, who is lifeless and can't act a lick. Her performance was almost as bad as Rachel McAdams' in the first movie. Rachel comes back (but only briefly) as Irene Adler leaving Noomi to stink up the main female role. The saving grace for the girls is Kelly Reilly, who once again shines as Watson's fiance/wife. The action is almost non-stop and the \"face to face\" confrontations between Holmes and Professor Moriarity (played to perfection by Jared Harris) are superb.I'd ignore the negative reviews and consider just who didn't like this movie. They are probably the same critics who swoon over the crap that winds up being nominated but never winning during awards season."
