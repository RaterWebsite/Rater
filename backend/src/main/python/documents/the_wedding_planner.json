    {
      "rating": "5",
      "text": "Jennifer Lopez is stunning and perfect in every scene, Matthew McConaughey is a very pleasant presence (although not as charming as after the hair miracle that the actor will experience in a few years). The story is what it is, fake as a plastic flower, and yet it would have been watchable if there was not an imbarassing poor depiction of the Italian maybe-to-be fiancee Massimo: the goofy, insignificant, language-clich\u00e9 speaking (\"Mangia, mangia\"), and ultimately boring young man cannot even start hoping to share the same room with JLo's character, let aside marring her, therefore this part of the story is far from being believable: it would have worked better if there were some real competition between him and McConaughey's character. 9 for JLo, 5 for the movie."
