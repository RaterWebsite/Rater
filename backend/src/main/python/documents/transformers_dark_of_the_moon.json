Michael Bay, with all his grace, delivers one of his finest peaces of contemporary cinema up to date. You wouldn't believe it without seeing it. Close to the end of the film, my friend sitting next to me turned at me and whispered: \"This is beyond Blockbuster madness\". And it made sens. What Bay and his team have achieved is beyond conventional summer movie making. The crafting here is so perfect and detailed  that it pushes and redefines the boundaries of film making. From the chilling sound design, to the godlike visual effects, and perfect attention to detail from Bay's part when choosing his shots.It's an honest work that re establishes what fun is all about when the lights dim down and the screen springs to life.Just... Have fun and don't pay attention to all those lifeless critics who's conceptual fun is merely based on egocentric shallow intellectual show off and pragmatic dismissing of Bay's work.

Ok it is not a drama filled with great emotions or with extraordinary plot but is well developed and with great visual effect that take your breath away. And that is what i was excepting from T3 a lot of special efects."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Regardless of what people say about Michael Bay the one thing the man knows to do better than anybody is to deliver an action packed cinematic experience. Transformers: Dark of the Moon is the the third outing of the Transformers franchise and is an imrprovement on the much maligned Revenge of the Fallen. Personally, I thought the negativity towards the second film was extremely harsh it's far from the worst film or sequel for that matter. Dark of the Moon is once again a very long film coming in at over 2hrs 30 mins but it flies by and never seems to drag along. The film this time begins in 1961 with the battle between the Autobots and  Decepticons where a spacecraft known as the Ark is launched carrying an invention capable which is capable of ending the war once and for all however it is shot down and lands of the Earth's moon. In the present day the Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeaouf) is sturggling to find a job after college as he believes he should be working with the Autobots. The Autobots who once again are working in partnership the US military make a shock discovery whilst tracking down Decepticons in Chernobyl. They find a fuel cell from the Ark and after realising the spacecraft surivived the attack Optimus Prime set off to the moon to retrieve the remaining fuel cells and revive an old friend. A discovery regarding the fuel cells leads the Autobots in a race against time to stop the Decepticons initiating a plan to bring their planet to Earth. The storylines have never been compelling and to be fair hardly logical but they are engaging and is sheer entertainment and do bring around some of the biggest action sequences in the cinema to date as thats were Transformers 3 excels. The visual effects are outstanding and its one of the few films i've found were 3D is actually awesome! There's never a dull moment and the action is always on the go and ofcourse there's always a bit of humour added into the pack. The big question coming into this film was could film debutant Rosie Huntington-Whiteley replace a certain Megan Fox as the eye candy? Well let's just say the way she is introduced in this film won me over straight away its unforgettable and whilst she will no doubt be panned in all honesty the role of Sam's sweetheart is more about how hot they look rather than how good an actress they are. The film is an action blockbuster from start to finish and succeeds in that department in every aspect, no doubt Bay and co will have their haters but the film itself does the talking and given the amount of money it has grossed I find it hard to beleive this is the last time we will see Optimus Prime and co!"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "The Best Transformers yet by far. The action and effects were increased. The replacement of Megan fox wasn't that big of a deal, her replacement couldn't act very well also. The film had great twists that a lot of people didn't see coming. Optimus prime is one of my all time favorite film characters and he totally kicks some more but in Transformers 3. some scenes in this movie were a little over the top and weird but other scenes were hilarious. All action scenes were simply amazing and breath taking. I really enjoyed T3 and think it was a redemption of Revenge of the fallen, which was just ok."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "If you are looking for a story here, you'll be disappointed. But, honestly, this is TRANSFORMERS. What did you expect? Transformers isn't supposed to be about a great story story or character development. It's about insanely awesome visuals, explosions, special effects, and action. That is what this movie delivers. Basically, this movie is all about tying up loose ends, making puzzle pieces from the early films fall together, and making you laugh because your suspicions are becoming reality. Or, that's the beginning of the movie. From about the middle onward, it's pretty much nothing but action, explosions, and gunshots. there are a couple funny parts, but they will soon be lost in the mayhem. This movie is all about the action. If you want a storyline, go home, because that isn't what transformers is about. It's about awesome CGI visuals and non-stop action. Sadly, Megan Fox's replacement was the only thing that kept me from giving this a ten because, let's face it. Some think she's as hot, (me) more think she's less, and very few think she's more.

The movie was great, and a just follow-up the first two Transformers movies. Dark of the Moon had it's heartfelt, funny, and just jaw-dropping awesome moments.

It didn't reach up to the quality of the first 2 according to me. It had very funny moments, awesome CGI effects and the awesome actor Shia Labeouf. Even though those things are great for a movie, it lacked a lot of other things. To start with, I can't understand why Michael Bay changed Megan Fox to this new dumb blondie with silicon lips. She isn't sexier, and she is even worse at acting according to me. They also made a very weak ending on Megan's career. A few sentences.    This movie showed off the well-known rule \"Awesome things stops being awesome if you get too much of them\". There were simply too much CGI in this movie. The epic moment where you saw one or more transformers evolve or battle aren't gone, but they are everywhere! And it didn't help that the last battle lasted for one hour.    It is worth watching if you have seen the other Transformers, or if you get turned on by CGI effect."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I never saw the first 2, but I must say this is an excellent movie! They suck you in right at the beginning. The first scene will have your attention for sure. There is a good amount of action and drama as well. At no point was I bored or checking the time. The only reason I couldn't give this a 10 was simply due to not enough Optimus and not enough Bumblebee. Also, much of the movie is predictable if you ever watched transformers as a kid. 8/10"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Maybe the second was so bad that anything glows in comparison but in many ways this one is much better. There is less useless action throughout, although the last 40 mins do start dragging after the millionth explosion. What Michael Bay seriously misunderstands is action. Explosions do not equal excitement, it is what's at stake and the investment in the characters that makes sequences exciting. Nonetheless I knew the kind of film that I was going to get going in so I was able to enjoy most of it. The plot is much more easier to understand and I did find myself caring for some of the characters. Although just like the previous films, I can never tell who's who when the robots start fighting. It's just clashing metal. This time is was fun though."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This movie rarely has a dull moment. there are a lot of twists and turns. Figuring Megan Fox left the cast the transformers movies for sure lost some male viewers. But don't be to afraid men. The new girl is smoking hot! The non stop action happens within 1 hour and 30 minutes into the movie. and once it starts it nearly ever stops! They spend a lot of time in Chicago. And while they are their they have a very tough task to handle. And with the rise of the ultimate transformer. This is for sure a award winning movie."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Transformers 3 isn't Oscar-material, but it isn't anywhere near a plonker of a movie. The CGI is brilliant and some **** amazing Autobot-Decepticon action sequences are featured throughout, the plot line is really quite simple but it does draw you in quite effectively, with plenty of \"**** **** did not see that coming\" moments and an abundance of 'edge-of-your-seat' anticipation moments that really help get you emotionally connected with the characters (my favourite Autobot died during the first half and a universal favourite...I won't spoil this, but there's certainly a very intense moment with Bumblebee, but I won't tell you how it concludes) the actors are brilliant with plenty of big Hollywood names playing both major and minor roles, good and bad, the dialogue is hilarious and the characters are loveable and engaging. The final showdown is everything that it should be and more (it's not Optimus vs. Megatron, although that does happen) and Sam finally gets some real action, being responsible for the destruction of one of the Decepticon high-ups. I do have three complaints. One-The opening sequence that explains the conspiracy behind the moon-landing, it does drone on for a fair while and features a particularly horrible JFK impersonator. Two- Skids and Mudflap are gone! I know that some people found them offensive, but i found them hilarious, and I think they told the first crude joke that my dad has ever laughed at, which was something of a magical moment for me, the least they could have done was kill them off early on alongside my favourite transformer. Three- The Optimus vs. Megatron showdown takes about ten seconds, granted, the previous battle was the big one that everyone wanted to see by that time, but I guess it all comes down to the fact that since RotF, Megatron has been portrayed as a weak-ass **** and that's one thing that I will not forgive this movie for. Ultimately, this is a must-watch, with a brilliant plot to suck you in coupled with kick-ass moments of **** dude, ****s about to go down, **** **** **** and brilliantly choreographed action sequences. Better than any film in regards to action, but I still prefer the original movie when it comes to plot, but all-in-all, if you're looking for a perfectly balanced mix of Drama, Action, Comedy, Plot and CGI-Epicness, you can't ignore this movie"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This movie is this summers best of all.

The only reason I didn't give it 10 was because the twist was too predictable and the end felt totally cut off, you sit through 3 hours of movie, only to have the credits start to roll, although that said, it was better than the first movie's \"10 minutes of Optimus Prime Speech\" ending.

However, it is a great summer popcorn flick."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Transformers 3 is an excellent action movie flik. The plot isb easier to follow now because it's more simple. I actually saw this in 2d format because at the time I didn't have enough money for me and my friend. I heard from some people that the 3d was as good as Avatar which I had seen. The 2d though to me wasn't really that bad so I didn't feel like I missed out on much.The plot of NASA keeping a secret about the Apollo 11 1969 landing on the moon was pretty cool start to the movie and also interplaying that with finding a cybertronian ship with Optimus Primes mentor, Sentinal Prime gave it a good mystery to the plot for me. Shia Labeouf again was top notch again as the funny Sam Witwicky. Also Patrick Dempsey for me played his role very well. The comedy to me was toned down to me in ways but the comedy in this one I thought was better than the 2nd one  without it getting to non serious. All of the comedy guys I thought did a good job.  Tyrese Gibson and Josh Duhamel  also played their roles pretty well. All the villians in this movie are great for the most part. Overall the action is done mine blowingly well and the robots look to me quite realistic in all the places and city environments. There's gonna be a lot of wow moments for the audiences especially supposably  in 3d. As far as the pacing I thought it was good for the most part despite it being like a 2 and a half hour movie. Now the negatives are some of the robots and new robots in the film didn't get the character development, as for like Shockwave I don't even think it had a voice actor and it had some cool moments but they didn't really show much of Shockwave. Also some of the new autobots didn't get a lot of character development. Some of the deliberately comedy relief characters didn't bring anything to the plot as the movie unfolded as well s a few others as well I think.  But above the negatives this haves to be not only the best Transformers movie, but it's one of the better action movies of all time. This is definately a much watch.

But that doesn't mean im gonna  love whatever they made . The first one was good . The second one ..... well i actually felt asleep while watching . At-least this one kept me awake . this one is really the best of the franchise . i like the story which . this story took me way back to the animation series unlike the first two . but the problem is (i don't know why) Bay always focus on the human characters like Sam and Us Military . sometimes it felt like im watching a movie about a war fighting by Military with their Robots . But  Transformers(animated) was like this . that was so wide and actually focused on the different Transformers and more about them . there are more awesome Transformers out there and lot of awesome fighting techniques which were missing . Now acting...... Rosie Rosie Rosie ! She is one of my favorite VS angels ! i was so excited to see her reprising Fox ! i think she did good(as first time) a lot better then Fox (of course) . Siha was more down then the last film as well as josh(i really like his acting but not in this one) .  Patrick Dempsey was good but John Turturro was awesome . as for the voice actors there's nothing to say they are the best of the best .really like Leonard Nimoy as Sentinel Prime. i actually loved the V.effects and transformations it was much more clear and awesome then the last two . Overall it was the best entry but still i expected more .as i said at fast im a huge fan so i would love to see more films but i want to see a Reboot and with good story about Transformers not some kid and military .

It has better scenes then The avengers trust me. Watch where The avengers get their scenes and story from. The story was Ok, The characters were not bad but the special effects were something to remember."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Transformers: Dark of the moon is still thin on plot, and it doesn't matter.
