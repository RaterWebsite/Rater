      "text": "I really enjoyed this film! To watch the struggle young adults are facing when deciding between open and traditional relationships! The excitement of open relationships and what they may bring at the beginning is intriguing, but after a while many of these exciting detours lead to frustration and emptiness that cause most of these people to reassess what they really want from someone they love and what they want in someone who loves them back! Thought both of the actors did an excellent job at acting and making these characters believable, especially Laia Costa, a Spanish hotty!!"
