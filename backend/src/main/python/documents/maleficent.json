I knew that if any actress could pull off the Disney villain Maleficent, it was none other than Angelina Jolie, an all-time favorite of mine. But I cannot deny the fact that the things that made this a Disney movie is pretty much what ended up strangling it. I liked the angle of her being a fairy who isn't sure about humans but tries to connect and even love them and is betrayed in a gruesome fashion. The film seemed solid until she started to seem quite a bit softer than would be consistent for a dark fairy/witch who threatens an entire kingdom of people. It's not that she could have been more sadistic but more like all the other characters could have been smarter, like all of them. Everyone who wasn't Maleficent was either crazy or pin headed. Except maybe her helper crow. But that sort of made it an environment where she had to do everything for everyone like the nanny, kind of a weak approach for a character with such a strong presence. Meaning she needed a stronger antagonist, Sharlto Copley didn't deliver for me. Just came off a little too insane. The story just got too predictable and cliche' to stay intriguing. The visuals did not disappoint though and who can't help but love Angelina's portrayal of a famous villain. A different story all together may have proven better for her character. I mean, if everyone tells the story claiming that's how IT REALLY HAPPENED, i mean who actually knows how it really happened then? How many stories do you need to bleed dry Disney?"

Not only does it suffer from complete lack of character development but it also fails to create any interest in anyone beyond the title character.

But what I loved the most about the movie was the villain, Maleficent. She was so creepy and evil, it was awesome! So when I heard Disney was going to make a live action adaptation of Sleeping Beauty focused completely on Maleficent, I was excited. But my god was I wrong! For one, they make Maleficent good. That is such a bad idea and the worst part is they want us to simpithize with her! Uh, hello you realize she cursed and infant baby right? Speeking of which, Aurora is really bland in this movie. And don't even get me started on Prince Philip, he's pretty much useless in this film. King Stefen is probably the most forgettable Disney villains ever. The three fairies, WHAT THE HECK!!! They turned them into Three Stooges"

Retelling the story from the villain's point of view could have worked if only she had stayed a villain and the characters had acted reasonably, but nothing made any sense.  Maleficent wanted revenge and she could have killed the young princess a hundred times yet she did not. The father didn't need to send his daughter away, especially not with 3 so incompetent women. He also didn't  react realistically when he was reunited with his daughter considering that he was so crazy because he loved her so much and tried to protect her.  I expected that the \"true love's kiss\" in the end is gonna be a twist and it could have worked if only it was Diaval who kissed her, because it was built up, from the very beginning it seemed like he cared about the princess. If maleficent remained a villain as she is supposed to be, it would have been nice to see that the bird/guy she tormented turns against her, ruin her evil plan and two person who suffered Maleficent's cruelty end up together. Instead, this \"twist\"  is plain dumb, the king became completely evil for no logical reason, the villain became nice again for no logical reason... etc. Meh..everything is dumb in this movie.\rSo let's see the positive things... It looks good. Yeh, that's it. The visual effects are cool, the whole fantasy setting is beautiful, the costumes are great, Maleficent looks exactly as she is supposed to look. But this does not save the movie, its bad, don't watch it!"

I also praise Disney for introducing a grey area to all the black-and-white fairytales we already know (though this is not original or innovative). It certainly looks beautiful enough, with the 3D - like with most features - being most effective on the quiet, less spectacular scenes (such as the walk through the forest) as opposed to the grandiose battle scenes. Nonetheless, with all that going for it, it still feels like little more than another telling of the same story, as opposed to a retelling.Dem cheekbones though."

Unfortunately, I am a little girl and while this director lengthy resume with visual effects clearly shows it also shows that he doesn\u2019t know much else. This is a first time director whose mainly done visuals all his life, which is reflected in his failure to tell a good story. The film starts telling a story about two good characters and it seems like we will get the interesting motivations for Maleficent being evil or a misunderstood villain but instead the film just switches the moralities leaving me wondering if the King will get his own movie where he is shown in better light. I didn\u2019t expect much from this movie but I never thought I\u2019d get writing this atrocious with poorly written characters, an incoherent story, and an experience that makes me want to prick my finger on the spinning wheel and die.

Angelina Jolie is fantastic as ever, but as my friend said as soon as the movie ended, \"I would re-cast pretty much everyone but Jolie, Riley, Manville, Temple, and Staunton. Everyone else needs to go.\" And that's exactly how I feel as well.\r The movie starts with a very good scene in which young Maleficent is depicted as a kind-hearted, powerful young fairy, protector of Moors. Young Stefan actually works for me, but not with the grown-up Stefan. The cast just doesn't work. As soon as Jolie starts wearing the costume, I feel like I'm watching Halle Berry in that horrible Cat Woman spandex costume all over again. It just didn't work. Her natural-looking appearance was perfect. I don't understand why she had to change her appearance after her wings are cut off (only to reattach again).\r Elle Fanning is lovely, but she's not doing her best in this movie. I'm excited to see Oculus tomorrow which Brenton Thwaites is starring in, but his Prince Phillip character is way too irrelevant and unnecessary.\r The scenes are also very predictable. I totally saw the \"Maleficent is the true love\" twist right after somewhere aroud the first time she connects with Aurora. It's Frozen all over again. To sum up, I think the movie would only please children and those who simply watch the movie for eye-pleasing visual. Even the climax did not get me excited."

If not, they should watch the original Sleeping Beauty and then watch this. Better? Yeah.\rThis movie indeed has the potential to turn around the whole Sleeping Beauty story into something much better - more intricate, cooler and even thought provoking.\rThe main problem I have with this movie lays withing the writing and directing. Writers Linda Woolverton and Charles Perrault simply don't give the actors anything worthwhile to work with. Constantly the movie is preoccupied with transition scenes that literally tell us what has or is going on - too obvious, even for a children's movie. I believe it isn't in Disney's style.\rDirector Robert Stromberg went along with it and tried to make something of it, including some beautiful scenes, and other scenes that are as if ripped out from other fantasy flicks. He has done some pretty good work in the past, however here we see mediocrity and literacy, but I'm pretty sure that came out mainly from the script.\rI have to note out that this movie contains some of the worst camerawork I've ever seen - awkward zooming and totally worthless scenes included.\rOther than that, actors starring here had nothing to work with to begin with, so no one is even worth mentioning. Jolie tried to make Maleficent faithful and memorable, but ultimately fails, due to reasons already mentioned.\rAnd there is nothing more to say. It's a pretty movie, it had the potential to be a masterpiece, however it falls short to be classified as even a Disney kid film.\rIt can be entertaining to watch if you have nothing else to do, but that's about it."

      "text": "While it's fun to \"make-believe\" that frogs turn into Princes, Maleficent tells the untold tale of what happens when Princes turn into frogs.  And it tells the tale from the viewpoint of the person who is physically traumatized and emotionally betrayed by the very person in whom they placed their deepest love and trust and the inner journey to heal from that horrific evil and reclaim your own capacity to love...from the least expected source. This is a brave and true tale, told with stunningly beautiful direction by Stromberg, an ingenious script by Woolverton and timeless, flawless performances by Jolie and Fanning.  Reading most of the \"negative\" reviews of this film, it's pretty clear that many people 1) simply did not grasp the subtle philosophical messages of this film and 2) want to keep their \"fairy tale\" characters either black (evil) or white (good).  But telling those simplistic tales to our children does not prepare them for the complexity of the real world. Congratulations to all involved for crafting a blockbuster masterpiece that will actually create a better world by teaching empathy, understanding and the true meaning of love."

      "text": "\"Maleficent\" 10 Scale Rating: 7.5 (Very Good) ...\r The Good: Jolie seems like she was born to play Maleficent as she was perfect in bringing the classic villain to the big screen. A mere cock of her eyebrow or well-timed menacing glare would often times be enough to get the point across. Perhaps the best performance of Jolie's career. The story itself is well done and Maleficent's transformation from wronged fairy to evil queen was one of the highlights of the film. As a fan of the classic tale, I was more than a little apprehensive with a film casting Maleficent as an anti-hero, but it was well handled and believable. The special effects were also, for the most part, top notch as expected.\r The Bad: However, a few of the denizens of the fairy realm were poorly done and looked like cartoons. That was especially frustrating since the overwhelming majority of the film was an amazing spectacle. While I was fine with most of the liberties the film takes with the story (you are indeed warned that this is NOT the story you know, but instead is what really happened), there is a key part near the end that drops the film down a notch. I scratched my head at this particular scene as it almost makes you wonder why they made the film to begin with. Copley is hit and miss and on occasion over-acts. I sort of expected this from him though as it seems to be a common issue for him."

      "text": "I must confess, I was not really a huge fan of Walt Disney's 'Sleeping Beauty' (1959), for some reason, I thought that the film was nowhere near as fun or endearing as 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' (1937) or 'Cinderella' (1950). I did, however, enjoy the evil presence of the ever so powerful Maleficent, thinking she could just be one of the best Disney villains of all time, you would think that making a movie about her would be interesting, especially with Oscar winner Angelina Jolie in the title role.\r I am afraid that this film does not do the title character justice, 'Maleficent' commits the crime of being utterly boring, which is a word you wouldn't think could be used to describe a Disney film, but it is.\r We see Maleficent from a young age, and how she meets a boy named Stefan, and they grow up together falling in love. One day, when Stefan leaves for the kingdom, Maleficent is charged with almost killing the king. The king then promises whoever kills this villainous Maleficent will be the next in line to the throne.\r Sharlto Copley plays the much older Stefan, and he wants the throne so badly, that he betrays Maleficent on order to do so. Ever since this, we see Maleficent grow bitter, and when Stefan gets married and gives birth to a daughter, that's when she decides to curse the child. So, that's the reason why Maleficent did what she did, it's because the king is a cold-hearted person who is just unlikeable. If you're thinking that's not what happened in the animated classic, you are right...already this film makes no sense.\r Elle Fanning plays the princess Aurora, she is convinced that Maleficent is her fairy godmother, since she has been watching her since she was a baby. The two seem to get along, and Maleficent seems to think that maybe she is overreacting, which in this case, yeah she is.\r This film spends too much time showing us some colorful CGI, and numerous flying creatures as if we are in a \"Harry Potter\" film, but neither look impressive enough to hold our attention for more than five minutes. The film also plods along ever so slowly, for a film that is supposed to be 97 minutes long, it feels like an extra hour longer. There is no life in this film, no sense of fun and excitement...it is devoid of energy.\r Angelina Jolie looks great in the role, but she is ultimately one note, I do not blame her, the blame is for the screenwriter, who just happens to be Linda Woolverton who wrote the wonderful 'Beauty and the Beast' (1991). How could a writer, who wrote something so magical, and so exciting...then go to to write something so lifeless and almost boring?\r The dark colors and cartoon-ish CGI do not save the movie at all, everything about this film is just not worth your time or money. 'Maleficent' is a magnificent bore."

Elle Fanning is perfect for the role as Princess Aurora, no other actress would have been better for the role as Princess Aurora then Elle Fanning, and no other actress would have been better for the role as Maleficent then Angelina Jolie.

Another thing i like about this film is that the story is amazing and even with some new twists which makes it interesting as I have noticed with this film. The pacing is great because it doesn't feel rushed like some other movies around 98 minutes can feel. The acting is perfect. Not one movie star in this movie had any bad acting, so i was happily surprised with that not being an issue.

I mean come on this is the meanest deadliest witches of all we are talking about!! well that aside I've never believed in Angelina as a Superhero, Super Secret agent or any Epic character, she should stick to more complex and psychological characters, that's why I expected a memorable Maleficent but instead the movie kept me asking what and why and it never gave me the answer. But Disney you own the stories you can tare them apart as much as you want."

But the story is weak, the most interesting part is the first act, while there\u00b4s a big amount of minutes where nothing seems to happen in the second act. Nice message with some women empowerment. Not much more going on. You can stream it."

      "text": "This film is a very symbolic film and if you take the chance to sit and reflect upon what you have seen, I think you will agree with me in saying that the story is was intelligently written. Although fairy tales are fantasy, they often make comments on the real world, and this film establishes the fact that nobody is simply evil.\r This is not a recreation of Maleficent or Sleeping Beauty, it is a revision and it executes that perfectly.  My only flaw with the film was that the cruelty of Maleficent did not really develop to the climax (Aurora's curse)."

Some people say it was a bit cliche-ish but all Disney movies are like that, and this is so unique I am sure if it didn't have to follow the initial story of sleeping beauty this would have been different. The visuals were incredible. I especially loved the flying and battle scenes near the beginning (I think you can probably tell why because of my user). Certainly one of the most unique and interesting Disney movies yet. I would recommend it to anyone! 10/10 for sure."

      "text": "Immediately as the film starts, a narrator tells us about Maleficent's back story. We are shown who she is, but most of what the audience knows is delivered through narration. We meet Stephen shortly afterwards. Maleficent falls in love with him because the narrator says so. However, Stephen is \"ambitious\" because the narrator says so. Stephen leaves Maleficent behind. She is sad because the narrator says so... The narrator eventually eases off halfway through the film. This is a poor way to impart exposition to the audience in a film, and the rest of the narrative is unfortunately weak due to further poor characterization of the antagonist and supporting characters. Jolie's performance as Maleficent saves her character somewhat. I DID like the feminist message at the end, clumsily executed as it was. Ultimately, this film suffers from very basic narrative and character deficiencies resulting from poor exposition and cliche overuse. This film is not necessarily terrible, but one should not expect to find a profound feminist narrative here."
