It's almost up to the same level of quality that once saw the comedian dominating the box-office back in the day. The production values and concept are on point. It just needed better jokes. Not that it isn't funny. Sandler and Aniston's chemistry ensure that things remain amusing throughout. They're just never hilarious enough to elevate the movie above anything more than the kind of easy watching time passer that Netflix regularly churns out."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "It's too long and it's very cheesy but the b-movie antics are elevated by Jennifer Aniston who steals the show with a solid likable performance. I enjoyed it much more than I expected to as I'm not usually a fan of Adam Sandler movies.

The premise has been seen before, but the presentation seems fresh. It's not often that I sit through a comedy these days, but found myself enjoying it. Was it brilliant? No. But it was simple fun."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This is a good movie despite what most critics say. It may have a slightly twisted plot but is definitely worth watching. It features hilarious main cast (Adam sandler, Jennifer aniston) members and is a decent addition to the comedy and thriller genre."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "A surprising funny movie from Adam Sandler.

Of course the film have it's flaws, but in a greater perspective, it's a funny and interesting movie."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "This Adam Sandler film is an improvement from the last work we have seen from him, it works well enough to be entertaining, good supporting cast and not one fart joke."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "This is by far the worst movie of 2019. Sometimes movies are funny just because they reach a very low level intentionally.

Extremely sad that it's very underrated"}, {"rating": "3", "text": "One of the most nuanced example set for women empowerment, Sandman has got what these big banners would kill to have for; Aniston will solve it, though.Murder MysteryI try and always give credit to the creators or directors at first, before I start on saying something about the film. But over the years, with plenty of films and other appearances on stages or shows, the Sandman- as Sandler claims himself to be- has remain Sandman all the way through, untouched and unfiltered with only a couple of exceptions. And just like all of them, this one too is a Sandler film. With that same unorthodox method and repetitive familiar jokes and goofy flirty language, the film suffers the same consequences. My brother is a huge fan of his and over the years we have had our fair share of debates.And what this has accounted with, is material against procedure. Adam Sandler is an amazing comedian, and so is his comic timing in his films. But the film, no matter of comedy genre, cannot simply run on gags. The film defines, asks, it to be a collaboration of simply good work from all accounts. Whether it be execution or narration. The goofiness is tolerating, in fact, it is encouraged in a world like such. But the lack of concentration on the state and vocab and command over the characters is never negotiable.My brother often turns down the discussion by announcing it as an escape route from the real world- as any fan would- that has been bugging you for an entire week. But is it really enchanting or engaging enough to get lost? Even an amateur film buff finds it hard to swallow these clunk of rocks, set and told, as the final polished product. So where does this project in Sandler's catalogue lies? Murder Mystery is not his finest or most ambitious work of all but it certainly shines the Sandman label clear and bright with gorgeous locations and his middle age crisis."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "While segments of \"Murder Mystery\" are entertaining, the jokes in James Vanderbilt's script simply does not land often enough. The mystery itself is dumb, and the bickering between Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler is annoying.

I would not recommend this movie to anyone above a 5 year school education."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I enjoyed this new installment from Adam Sandler very much. Hence, I don't know why this movie got a so low rating. This is your classic typical Adam Sandler comedy. If you like Adam Sandler type of movies, then you will certainly like this one. It has all the Adam Sandler quirks that you are accustomed to, but with more subtlety and sophistication and ofcourse some are borderline absurdity, but thats what we like about Adam Sandler style of humor. The pair up with Jennifer Aniston turned out to be perfect, as Jennifer is a queen of sitcom comedy herself, you can see that she immersed herself perfectly in the comedy world of Adam Sandler. The rest of the cast were quite engaging and by the end of the movie, you wish this could be a franchise and longing for a part 2 !"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "It\u2019s very beautiful because jennifer aniston is magnificentCome stai facendo un sacco con me lo chiedi pure a te e pap\u00e0 di pi\u00f9 di un sacco con me lo chiedi pure a te e pap\u00e0 di pi\u00f9 di un sacco con me lo chiedi pure a te e pap\u00e0 di pi\u00f9 di un sacco con me lo chiedi pure a te e pap\u00e0 di pi\u00f9 di un sacco con me lo chiedi pure a te e pap\u00e0 di pi\u00f9 di un sacco con me lo chiedi pure a te e pap\u00e0 di pi\u00f9 di un sacco con me lo chiedi pure a te e pap\u00e0 di pi\u00f9 di un sacco con me lo chiedi pure a te e pap\u00e0 di pi\u00f9 di un sacco con me lo chiedi pure a te e pap\u00e0 di pi\u00f9 di un sacco con me lo chiedi pure a te e pap\u00e0 di pi\u00f9 di un sacco con me lo chiedi pure a te e pap\u00e0 di pi\u00f9 di un sacco con me lo chiedi pure a te e pap\u00e0 di pi\u00f9 di un sacco con me lo chiedi pure a te e pap\u00e0 di pi\u00f9 di un sacco con me lo chiedi pure a te e pap\u00e0 di pi\u00f9 di un sacco con me lo chiedi pure a te e pap\u00e0 di pi\u00f9 di un sacco con me lo chiedi pure a te e pap\u00e0 di pi\u00f9 di un sacco con me lo chiedi pure a te e pap\u00e0 di pi\u00f9 di un sacco con me lo chiedi pure a te e pap\u00e0 di pi\u00f9 di un sacco con me lo chiedi pure a te e pap\u00e0 di pi\u00f9 di un sacco con me lo chiedi riopure a ricordo il mio compagno mi piace un sacco con me lo chiedi pure a te e pap\u00e0 di pi\u00f9 di un sacco con me lo chiedi pure a te e pap\u00e0 di pi\u00f9 di un sacco con me lo chiedi pure a te e ieriirieitii itieioegir a me lo chiedi pure a me piace un sacco con me lo chiedi pure a te e pap\u00e0 di pi\u00f9 di un sacco con me lo chiedi pure a te e pap\u00e0 di pi\u00f9 di un sacco con me lo chiedi pure a te e pap\u00e0 di pi\u00f9 di un sacco con me lo chiedi pure a te e pap\u00e0 di pi\u00f9 di un sacco con me lo chiedi pure a me lo sento pi\u00f9 a casa mia sorella \u00e8 andata a casa mia sorella \u00e8 una cosa ma non mi piace un sacco di dove siete tutti dei ragazzi che si \u00e8 il giorno in cui mi sono dimenticato la foto del genere che non ho internet lento di un sacco con me lo chiedi pure a te e pap\u00e0 di pi\u00f9 di un sacco con me lo chiedi te e pap\u00e0 di pi\u00f9 di un sacco con me lo chiedi pure a te e pap\u00e0 di pi\u00f9 di un"}, {"rating": "3", "text": "It could be fascinating movie, but once again we got boring, predictable and stupid film.

They should to start looking for more challenging projects because they are wasting their talents."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "The movie was pretty decent for a adam sandler movie, although it does have have unrealistic expectations. First of all i'm pretty sure you're not suppose to get off your seats, even if you wanted earplugs. Second of all what type of famous or rich person befriends a cop and his wife of 15 years. It was also pretty unwatchable for me if it includes a scene that's too embarrassing for me to watch (like the scene were Malcolm who asks \"who are you?\") also it was pretty predictable. I predicted that fact that other people die in this movie, but on the other note, the movie was pretty decent although half bad. i'll give this a 6 out of 10"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This movie is everything you would hope for in a comedic murder mystery.

The writing jokes wise is fairly typical sandler, but toned down a bit during the suspenseful parts.  the first 45 minutes or so is quite funny, and the 2nd half is more mystery and some suspense, with still a steady amount of humor. (usually bantering between the two leads, which also worked well in \"Just go with It\".) If you like Adam Sandler movies you will almost for sure like this movie.

It has been fruitful after all with the exception of Hotel Transylvania 3 all the actor's latest films have been in the streaming service including ''The Meyerowitz Stories''; The only film in which he did a good job since ''Reign Over Me''But honestly after all this time it's pointless to call most of his work disappointing. He knows what he sells and the audience consumes it, so anything else I could mention about that it's just irrelevant.This new film simply follows the comedic formula of everything he does and I've gotta say it because frankly I'm not a fan of his work and maybe for Netflix and for him this will be considered a success, I really don't know but for me it's a another boring film and another forgettable film for Netflix's catalog and for the actor's career.Jennifer Aniston?
