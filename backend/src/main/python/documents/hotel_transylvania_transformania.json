      "text": "This animated franchise reminds me of Ice Age because of how quietly they managed to conjure up a fourth installment.Especially since they had no competition in their first episode, and more importantly, no expectations from the public.But like that other saga, the quality of Hotel Transylvania has steadily declined with each new chapter, and this fourth adventure is perhaps the most disappointing one yet.I admit that for their target audience they will still be an amusing experience, but I think this is the point at which they're must be told that their good run is over."

      "text": "Happy New Year, Streamers! We\u2019ve left 2021 behind, but the show must go on. Last weekend, a favorite animated franchise came out with its 4th installment, Hotel Transylvania: Transformania. This sequel follows Drac and Johnny as they get entangled in one of Van Helsing\u2019s mysterious inventions gone wrong. Each is transformed and must find a way to transform back before it\u2019s too late! Of course, they have the help of Mavis and the other monsters of Transylvania as well. Let\u2019s see if this installment keeps up the previous bar.No point in hiding it \u2013 this movie was just as good as the others. Definitely, not better but just as enjoyable. Realistically, if you and your family members like Hotel Transylvanias 1 through 3, then you\u2019re in store for the same laughs. The gang is all here and the same ridiculous antics that were there before are here now. Now for some, that might be a negative but for the rest, that\u2019s what they came to see. Either way, I chuckled it up from Van Helsing to Drac and Blobby to Johnny \u2013 everyone caught their shine at some point in time. The only thing different about this movie, which in a way isn\u2019t that different, is the moral kids can learn from it. Here, the movie is telling us that doing things just to fit in isn\u2019t the best thing to do because who you are is great and the others just have to see it. Also, see the best in people and not just what\u2019s on the outside like a burnt marshmallow. Any way you hear the messages, it\u2019s a much-needed lesson for our kids to learn in a society full of peer pressure. The movie went a bit hard on this topic, but they did a good job pulling it together.This is a clear case of a streaming big box of popcorn. This animated series hasn\u2019t had a flop yet and Hotel Transylvania: Transformania is no different. Do I think they need to make more of these? Absolutely not, but this 4th installment is great fun for the family with good laughs and a great lesson to learn and re-learn. Families definitely should flip over to Prime Video and check out this movie."

      "text": "I actually liked the first three installments of this series, so going into it I wanted to like this one too. Unfortunately, this is by far the worst of the four movies. It failed to hold my attention for its already short 87 minute runtime, and I didn't laugh once at the humour(mostly slapstick). The animation is decent and the main story about Drac, Johnny, and Mavis is kinda cute with solid messages for the kids about honesty and acceptance, but this is not quite enough to redeem this movie. I get that its intended audience is kids/families, and maybe it would work for them, but for me it was uninteresting and unentertaining until the climax(which was easily the best part of the movie)."

      "text": "Well, after three mediocre films, they made another one and fulfills what it is, but I'm gonna say that Hotel Transylvania: Transformania is the best in the franchise. It's an entertaining adventure of the characters and that's all, it has a good message at the end but they doesn't development it at all and it seems that the development that Dracula has had in the previous films disappears.Animation quality comes and goes, at times it takes a step forward and at others it takes a step back."

      "text": "I didn't like this movie. It was pointless and the third one was a good place to stop the series. But no, this is Sony Animations, the people who give us sequels, even though we didn't ask for them. And I love this franchise. But this movie ruined a lot of things. The story is alright but it could have been done better. And nothing new happens in this movie. Except at the end when the hotel gets destroyed and they rebuild it. And when the end credits came up and I seen the small credits animation of the new hotel, I was sad. They had completely changed the hotel into.... well what Johnny would like it to look like. We went from an epic first film. To a slightly childish sequel. Then we had a good threequel and we could have left it like that. But then we have got the pointless and bad forth movie. I think the reason why I'm giving this 5 out of 10 was there was a line in the movie that made me agree. About halfway into the movie Johnny says \"if you always look for the bad in things, you will never find the best part\". I think it was something like that but I guess he was right. When I was watching this movie I was trying to look for the bad in things. Too bad there wasn't enough good things in this pointless movie to say it's good. I don't think this movie is terrible. But it is really pointless. ALSO I MISS ADAM SANDLER!"

The fact of the matter is that he\u2019s a complete cluck up and he\u2019s really not worth the emotional effort of someone who literally built a hotel to ensure the safety of monsters like him. It\u2019s tired. The whole Johnny-messes-up-but-it\u2019s-quirky-because-he-loves-Mavis-and-she-loves-him is TIRED. Can\u2019t the boy ever mature? You\u2019re telling me I gotta sit through 3 movies that make the vampire dad that\u2019s literally been doing the best for everyone around him since day one look immature?"
