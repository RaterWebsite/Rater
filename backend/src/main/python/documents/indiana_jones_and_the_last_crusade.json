Indy learns that a medieval historian has vanished while searching for it, and the missing man is his own father, Dr. Henry Jones Sr.. He sets out to rescue his father by following clues in the old man's notebook, which his father had mailed to him before he went missing. Indy arrives in Venice, where he enlists the help of a beautiful academic, Dr. Elsa Schneider, along with Marcus Brody and Sallah.

      "text": "I still don't care too much for the opening, which tries to explain some of the back story of the Indiana Jones character (fear of snakes, the whip and fedora, etc.); but the rest of this film mesmerizes me.  The addition of Connery to the cast (as Indy's father) is a nice touch, providing further insight into the character development, though it does seem to be pushed a bit past the limit at times.  Still, in a film-ic version of old serials, limits were made to be pushed.  There is not much time to relax during the entire running time, but I don't see that as a problem.  The humor (through both the Marcus Brody and Saliah characters, as well as the interplay between the Fords) is in just about the right proportion (again though, it does push the limits).  The storyline harkens back to the \"Raiders\" style, drawing on religious themes and including everyone's favorite bad guys:  Nazis.  It's flicks like this which go a long ways to atoning for past mistakes (re:  \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\")."

The Last Crusade improves on Temple of Doom while just lacking the brisk efficiency of Raiders. It looks fabulous and has a great music score. The script is deliciously witty especially with the interplay between Ford and Connery, and the story is engaging. The action is epic, and I liked the neat sequence at the beginning that explains things such as Indy's fear of snakes and how he got the scar on his chin. Steven Spielburg does an excellent job directing, while both Harrison Ford and Sean Connery(in a masterstroke of casting) are perfectly cast as Indy and Indy's father. On the whole, exciting, witty and fun. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

The chemistry between Harrison Ford and Sean Connery is fantastic. The music of John Williams is great as always, the main theme just doesn't get old... it's one of the most famous themes in the history of film music.\r Indiana Jones is kicking some nazi butt as usual, this time pursuing the Holy Grail, and while he's at it also finding his father dr. Henry Jones senior who has been kidnapped. This time Indiana gets to see Hitler eye to eye, and he even gets his autograph.\r The Last Crusade gets a score of 10 out of 10, just like the first Indiana Jones movie Raiders of the Lost Ark."

In his third (and what for years what thought to be his last) adventure, Indy is on the hunt for that ultimate treasure, the Holy Grail. Along the way he must contend with Nazis, a secret brotherhood and, of course, snakes. Sean Connery is a wonderful addition as Indy's father, and the chemistry between he and star Harrison Ford may just be one of the best in film history. The movie is a true rarity in that its attempts to outdo each preceding chase sequence succeed. Though children might have trouble interpreting the plot, this crusade is one people of all ages will enjoy."

This time, Indy's dad joins the adventure, played by Sean Connery, and the chemistry between these two gives the movie a fantastic human center quite unique to the series. They find themselves on a quest to prevent the Nazis from acquiring the Holy Grail - and yeah, although this is essentially a rehash of the original, it's just so damn much fun that you simply don't care or even really notice. I'd seen films 1 and 3 several times before I suddenly realized how similar they were, and that's the impressive strength of \"Last Crusade\" - you get so caught up in everything with Indy and his dad, so swept up in spectacular chase sequences, that they could be after the Ark a second time and you still wouldn't care. \"Raiders\" may have established this traditional Indy formula, departed from only in the very different \"Temple of Doom\", but it is perfected and tied with a bow here in \"Last Crusade\". The music is at its best, the action is at its best, the characters are at their best, and of course Spielberg is at his best. It's a straight-up A-grade thrillride."

Harrison Ford has always been charming and great in his movies. But his roles as the archeology professor with an appetite for adventures put viewers all over the world in excitement and contentment. Indiana Jones is without a doubt an unforgettable character. \"The Last Crusade\" is the third movie which on my opinion is the best. I've watched it countless times. The father - son relationship between Harrison Ford and Sean Connery (who plays his father) is remarkable. The wittiness, dangers situations and the funny commentaries from Ford and Connery makes this movie so much different, special and unique from the others. All that combined with the wonderful presence of the late Denholm Elliot and John Rhys Davies blasts the movie extremely high. Spielberg and Lucas did create a masterpiece which will outlive us and will always fascinate everyone. All of those who love adventures, danger, adrenaline, history will enjoy to the max this epic production."

      "text": "The best of the Indianan Jones movies. The addition of Sean Connery and River Phoenix alone is remarkable as both were great actors. The dynamic between Indianan Jones and his father (Sean Connery\u2019s role) is some of the best (estranged) father / son relationships in movies. Then there is River Phoenix who is only used in the introduction scenes but it is one of the best introduction scenes in movie history and tells you everything that you need to know about Indiana Jones. Also praiseworthy Paul Maxwell role here as man with the panama hat (Don't know if he is even named in the movie). Short appearance but so memorable that everyone remembers him. But lets go back to the movie. After the legendary good introduction scene Indiana Jones is informed that his father is gone missing on his search for the Holy Grail. The Grail is his fathers lifelong obsession and Indiana Jones only goes on a journey to save his father as they have a rocky relationship and are a bit estranged. This is the beginning of a legendary adventure. The story is excellent and I do not see any flaws here. It has the right pacing and a good mix of action, humor, good twists and character development. I know I sound like a fan boy here but its one of the best performances from director Steven Spielberg, writer George Lucas and the whole team. Lets go to the actors. Harrison Ford is always great in his signature role (Even in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) and this is his best performance as Indiana Jones. I already praised Sean Connery and this is also one of his most remembered roles outside of James Bond. River Phoenix died far to young and would be possibly one of the most acclaimed actors in Hollywood today. Paul Maxwell shines in such a small role. John Rhys Davies and Denholm Elliot return to their roles and this improves this movie too. Both are fan favorites and well remembered characters too. They have again not the longest screentime but make a great performance. Then there are the antagonists I wont spoil here. All are excellent and enjoyable villains. This is such a great cast and an awesome performance. The script, actors and directing accomplish each other. This movie has so many memorable scenes be it the humorous (Non spoilery example: No tickets, the special \u201cautograph\u201d or the stamp joke), action scenes (No spoilers here) or character developments (Again no spoilers here). Again the sets and special effects are top notch and everything looks amazing and believable. Also again we got the famous and legendary John Williams for the score. He should have deserved more credits as he improved every movie where he made the score. Overall while there is no perfect movie this comes close. It became the gold standard for Indiana Jones movies and action adventures while also becoming a cult classic. I rewatch it once in a while because it is a movie you can enjoy again and again."
