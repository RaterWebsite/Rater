The first movie was never meant to be made into a series.\rThis sequel is beyond lame and corny. All the effects are overdone and intended to shock you but they make you cringe and are overly gory.

Then, at last, Final Destination 2 has been an improvement, but that's not saying much.Don't like: The predictable story, the pointless characters, the forgettable soundtrack and the lame bickering and arguing used from the first movie.Do like: The premise, the acting, the realistic death scenes and the clever writing.So, to sum it, not good, not bad, mediocre installment, but way better than the first.

That aside, the opening scene is, of course, impressive, and the deaths to follow are equally as good. Only Clear returns from the original (oh and that funeral guy) but the newbies are decent. It's much cornier also but enough comparing, as a stand-alone film it's entertaining and will impress the right audiences."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "The film doesn't need a script, if only because its language is not in talk but in the scenes of disaster, in which case here the tension is what gives the movie! Let's say that the film is quite strong enough, that besides the very impressive visual effects, you get a bit shocked in due to some scenes could not be forgotten for a long time... Like when you're going out of the car and you're in a traffic jam... already run through in a panic after seeing this movie... heheh Being a horror movie, many people fail to understand that movies like these should not be taken seriously, because it is only as great fun for fans of the genre. I read several comments on many websites about this film, not everyone liked, which is common because some found appealing and extremely bad taste, in fact, for a horror movie, what do you expect? Just don't agree to compare this movie with others like \"The Ring,\" \"The Others\", which are other types of horror films which deal with other issues other proposals... Premonition is a teen horror movie (like \"Scream,\" \"Urban Legend \"...) of humor, not psychological horror, for it has nothing to compare them. Director David R. Ellis did very well, because we can not always attend to a sequence as good as its predecessor."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "I found the movie quite entertaining. I would give it a 10 just for the crash scene in the beginning of the movie, which must be THE best crash scene ever done, seriously. I guess it would have been better not to have seen the first one, because this one is pretty much a copy, but still, it is entertaining. Which serves the purpose. It even contains several memorable scenes - how many movies can you name that contain scenes where people say \"Yes I remember that\" ? So, it was good value for the money."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Admittedly, it's kind of hard for me to consider this movie to be true horror. It's less concerned with scaring you and more interested in just throwing crazy deaths on the screen for cheap thrills. Occasionally it'll even pop in some jokes. There's nothing here that will get under your skin and keep you up at night. The concept is still great though and watching these bland characters try to cheat death, fail, and meet a gruesome demise has it's value.The kills themselves are pretty creative and often amusing. Their convoluted set ups are usually quite obvious, but every now and then it'll use the more chaotic moments for a bit misdirection. That's not to say it's smart in any way, but it can still provide a good kick here and there. The gore effects are quite well-done. The plot doesn't quite fare so well. It's a simple, but enticing premise that needed to be fleshed out with characters we cared about. Unfortunately that just didn't happen. Everyone is committed, but they are mostly just playing bland stereotypes who are there just to add to death's final body count. It does get a little deeper with the premonitions this time around, so that's neat.Overall, the movie doesn't really have much going for it other than the deaths. So it's simple, stupid fun aimed at the teenage crowd who would rather see blood and guts as opposed to real horror. That's not an entirely bad thing. It certainly does what it does decently enough. For true genre buffs though, this is a passing amusement at best."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Final Destination 2 it's not as good as the first one but it is still pretty good i mean Ali Larter return as claire and this movie has probably the best accident in the whole series.

Unless you enjoy Faces Of Death, or those drunk driving accident films they show in school, you probably won't get much of a kick out of this movie.

It's much worse than if they had been chopped up by a masked monster because deaths like the ones in Final Destination 2 actually happen to people in real life. The audience might as well be watching a snuff film. Of course, if you get off on this type of realistic sadism then you might enjoy it.

It also manages to include enough blood and gore to fill the Nile river. The deaths are even more inventive and chilling, and the final death is unexpected and funny as hell. I was packed full of evil giggling after seeing this one. After a while, I realized that in every horror movie there exists one character so hated and despised by the audience that they wish for that character to die in the most morally reprehensible way possible. Final Destination (and it's sequel) is built on this very concept, giving viewers an entire cast of such individuals and systematically kills them with merciless brutality.

Like the first someone has a vision but this time around it's a young woman who ends up stopping traffic and saves a group of strangers who of course begin to die in the spectacularly gruesome ways. The death setpieces are ridiculously impressive a combination of practical and digital effects. My favorite has to be the glass kill but all of them are remarkable and hella shocking. The movie unlike the original doesn't take itself seriously and neither should you but it also impressively lays out a complex twist that brings it all together.
