But, unfortunately, the film doesn't follow through on its promise, and the drama eventually devolves into a denouement that looks like it was fabricated by the \"Warren Commission\"-like agency in Alan Pakula's \"The Parallax View\". Also, having Ben Affleck's character's fling with an underage girl punished at the end doesn't work as well if Russell Crowe's character is implicitly hitting on a girl (Rachel McAdams) young enough to be his daughter. So much for high-mindedness."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Ninety-five percent of this movie is a smart, engrossing, well-acted thriller. I wasn't crazy about how it was shot -- too much washed out color and hand-held camera for this type of story -- but the script was tight and the performances good. Then came the ending. Without giving away what happens, let me just say that it's hard to imagine how a film this big makes it through all the studio execs and test screenings without somebody realizing that the ending simply doesn't make sense. I spent a good amount of time trying to go back through the events and figure out how the various characters knew what they supposedly did, but it doesn't come together. Then I went online and found that it doesn't make sense to anyone else either. It's really too bad, because this could have been a great movie if they'd just left it alone. It didn't even need the extra twist which wound up killing the overall experience."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Good film.

Crow and Mirren shine as always. Affleck is OK."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This film is based upon an intriguing story, it has a fascinating script, and some great acting performances. It is Ben Affleck's standout performance of his career, and one which shows he has finally stepped out of the whole 'Bennifer' & Gigi shadow. The more investigation is done by Russell Crowes character the deeper the mystery gets. The twists are amazing, but are nicely understated. 9/10 from me. I notice some of the weaker critics reviews are carried out by the bloggers that the film does have a sly dig at, by hinting, and then showing how they are not real journalists."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Very good movie.

It's not the Oscar contender it could have been, but still worth seeing. Robin Wright Penn, Jason Bateman, and Rachel McAdams were the key navigators of the plot, and sometimes steal scenes from Mirren and Crowe, who are good as always. Affleck had a weird approach to his character, but is still believable. The twist was intelligent but the movie didn't build enough suspense to reach that twist effectively. This has a marvelous backstory which I want to give away but won't, and is also an example of cliches well-executed and excellent. That said, it could have used some more originality. Without the performances of Penn, Bateman, and McAdams, this probably would have gotten a 6."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Excellent thriller, that's well acted and fairly easy to follow with quite a few twists and turns that will keep you till the end."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Okay but lacked the punch that would have made it great.

See it!"}, {"rating": "5", "text": "It's like they took the original mini-series and accidentally washed it in the pocket of a pair of jeans. Rachel McAdams is operating at her usual old-style-Hollywood level of charisma, but Russell Crowe plays Cal as a cartoon, not as a character. And it may be crass to speak thus of the Queen herself, but I liked Bill Nighey better when he was being played by Bill Nighey, not by a watered-down Helen Mirren. I guess you know you're in trouble when the most convincing acting in a film comes from Ben Affleck. Watch the original mini: this is nothing but Cliff's Notes by comparison."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "To underline the increasing irrelevance of the newspaper in our everyday lives, the filmmaker shrewdly undercuts Cal McAffrey's bloated sense of self-worth with editing choices which democratizes the working relationship that the seasoned reporter has with \"His Online Girl Friday\". In another era, when newspapers were thriving, this subdued scene would have been much ado about something. As Cal(Russell Crowe) pulls Della Frye(Rachel McAdams) out of a meeting, her online colleagues give her only a cursory look and continue forward with their conversations without the slightest notion of envy visible on their faces. By the standards of the past, Della, a blogger(an intern of sorts), is a proper journalist now, but as the cub reporter speaks to her experienced mentor, nobody behind the glassed-in conference room looks all that impressed. A lot has changed in the fifteen years since Ron Howard's \"The Paper\" was released into theaters. \"State of Play\" is a love letter to the newspaper industry, but if you read between the lines, it reads like a \"Dear John\" letter. Case and point: a veteran writer such as Cal, in all likelihood, would be hesitant to share his byline with a rookie, but \"State of Play\" has cheating on its mind. While it sings the praises of old school journalism, the film privileges the enemy, the blogger, by giving her more credit than she deserves. Cal doesn't give Della co-authorship on his article, \"State of Play\" does. Finally, when Cal leaves the newsroom, his triumphant walk pass the cubicles is spoiled, as Della hogs some of his spotlight, symbolically denying hard news journalists like Cal and his ilk, a graceful bow from the public sector."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "A surprising gem.

Hollywood should have left well enough alone. Although the performances of Crowe and Afleck are very good, This version of 'State of Play' is no 'All the President's Men' which it tries at times to emulate. The film unsuccessfully tries to be an adult political thriller. It fails miserably. There is enough of an interesting plot in tis verion that I want to watch the original BBC production.

Based on a 5 hour BBC mini-series of the same name, and obviously having to omit a lot to condense into a film, you do not feel like there are unexplained aspects to the story by the end of it.\rKudos to all the actors involved. Crowe carries the film  a last minute replacement for Pitt, you get the feeling that this would have been an entirely different film if Pitt were involved. Crowe is excellent as the scruffy, truth-seeking newspaper journalist. McAdams puts on a good performance as the young, talented, somewhat naive and yet ballsy, eager-to-learn newspaper blogger. Mirren is, as always, a treat to watch. Bateman's performance as a bisexual, sleazy \"P.R\" man is amazing. Why, even Afflect, as congressman Collins, is surprisingly good in this film! I've heard various comments about his performance here, but honestly this was a difficult role to play (many emotional aspects) and he delivered.\rThe pace of the movie was just right, up to the last minute, where the climatic ending you were probably waiting for never comes, and everything wraps up in a rather anti-climatic way. Still, Crowe typing away as the whole newsroom peer over his head, seems like a befitting ending. The truth has been told. Now it's up to the public to read about, in what appears to be the dying age of the newspaper."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "State of Play is a fresh concept.\rThe acting is decent, but the script is exceptional.

A very good thriller, a few plot holes here and there, but nothing easily noticeable."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "State of Play: 6 out of 10: State of Play is two hour plus big budget thriller without one memorable scene and only one memorable performance. The memorable performance is Helen Mirren who brightens up the screen whenever she appears. The rest of the performances are more stereotypes than individual characters.\r Russell Crowe plays a reporter for a Washington Post stand-in. He looks and act like the stereotypical beat reporter. His best friend is Congressman Ben Affleck who is your standard movie congressional representative (Noble but battling demons.) He is caught in an affair with a now dead staffer and his best friend is on the case. Tagging along with Crowe is neophyte cub reporter Rachel McAdams who Jimmy Olsens it up despite the fact she is a lead blogger at a major national newspaper. Robin Wright Penn plays Affleck\u2019s cuckolded wife and seems to be in a different movie than the rest of the cast.\r Mirren is the newspapers publisher and gets the films best lines, which she dishes, with aplomb. Everyone else seems to be playing along at half speed. For a thriller there is a strange lack of action or tension. The twists seemed preordained and the characters behave exactly as they are programmed.\r The film certainly has star power and a big budget but it simply does not seem to know what to do with it. Part of the problem is that it is condensed from a 2003 British mini-series of the same name. Condensing the 300 minutes of plot into 120 or so minutes leaves little room for character development or nuance. The players seem to be quickly checking of plot boxes.\r The films other big problem is that it is a overwrought love letter to the newspaper business, including groan worthy dialogue about the magnanimous printed fourth estate and an end title sequence that can only be described as porn for publishers.\r Somewhat entertaining and yet eminently forgettable State of Play is worth a look.
