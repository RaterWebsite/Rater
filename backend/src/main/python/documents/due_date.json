Somehow this managed to evade my attention and after picking it up at a bargain price I have to wonder how i've managed to miss it! It's not the Hangover that's for sure, infact it's not as good as the Hangover but it is up their this is another awesome comedy from the maestro himself. Robert Downey Jr is absolutely brilliant in this alongside the ever dependable Zach Galafianakis as two men caught in a mix up which leaves Downey stranded and forced to take a roadtrip across America in order for him to get home for the birth of his child. Along the way there are some classic comedy LOL moments as expected but there are also some really great heartfelt and bromance moments. At times its just outrageous but that makes this flick all the better. One word of advice don't expect another Hangover because i'd imagine you might end up disappointed although I don't know how because Due Date has plenty on offer and is another gem from Phillips as the chemistry between Robert Downey Jr and Zach Galifianakis alone is worthy of a watch they are awesome, much like this movie!"

As most have noted it's a sort of remake of the classic Trains, Planes and Automobiles, without the heart of John Candy. Sure there are laughs but I didn't find the characters believable. Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis sound like a dream team. I loved him in the recent Its Kind of a Funny Story, here he's kind of annoying. And Downey is just too way too uptight. Oh well. Maybe next time."

Galifianakis and Downey Jr. make a terrific double-act, and produce some real moments of comedy gold.  Okay, Downey Jr.'s character can be unlikeable at times and very mean-spirited towards the lovable goofball played to perfection by The Hangover's stand-out comedian, but the situations he is forced to endure are so ridiculous and humiliating I can kind of understand his escalating frustration.  Some moments were so unexpected, non PC, and expertly played by the leads, that I literally could not stop chuckling.  Perhaps the last third of the movie is less impressive and a little derivative, but by this point I was totally won over and again Todd Phillips directs a great modern comedy."

Unfortunately, if you've seen the preview, you've seen all the funny parts. Robert Downy is great as the moody, uptight, Peter. Zach Galifianakis however, was pretty bland. Metro-sexual Ethan didn't have the same shock value and loveable loser quality as Alan did, I didn't find him funny, I just felt sorry for him. The plot didn't help the film much either. How many times have you seen two strangers, thrown together by happenstance taking a road trip together? Due Date was OK, but it's been done, and they made the rookie mistake of putting everything good into the preview. Despite the great cast, I say pass on this one."

      "text": "Don't be fooled by its invisible title- 'Due Date' is a rare gem. No more than a comedy, but no less than it either, it is the movie you want to see if you miss laughing from your heart and brain, and if you want to remember that feeling for some time before its stolen by slapstick senselessness.\rThis comedy does not have a bucketful of curses, wise lines and pranks, nor needs it, for it has a forgotten true sense of humor and therefore-excellent rhythm between funny and serious. Most uniquely however, it has excavated humor's vital ingredient-a story from reality, extraordinary enough to tell, but that can befall us all.\rEveryone can identify with the tale of expecting to wake up to a normal day and easily fulfill one's plans, when the prankster of life suddenly makes it all go extremely wrong. And everyone can laugh at its tragic comedy, however often it has been told, especially when it is highlighted in a character who doesn't see it coming at all. A fully socially proper, politically correct and controlled, technologically supported and psychologically eloquent modern husband and careerist who even knows when his child will be exactly born.\rEspecially when he is played by Mr. Robert Downey Junior, who is so brilliant and believable in this role, that one takes it to be truly him. But for the excellently chosen subtle strangeness in his face and demeanor, that is eventually fully blown out by his co-star and co-traveler Mr. Galifianakis who excellently plays his annoying, ludicrous, socially intolerable and unconstrained opposite.\rEven though the film itself leads to the conclusion that it is all about their hilarious mismatch and misfortune of traveling together cross country that is forced on Robert Downey by Galifianakis, and that will end in life-changing friendship, this is a comedy that perhaps hides a deeper message. By causing utter havoc to one modern man's plans, it destroys his metrosexual mask, it dares to reveal his humanity and suppressed rage underneath it, with the falsehood of the signs of our times he every so often bumps into on his long  journey home. The words one must not utter in an airplane, the politically correct way of dealing with nasty children, and our wives' best friends writing them e-mails. After all, would the size of Juliette Lewis, Jamie Fox and Rza, appear in this movie for anything less?"

      "text": "Probably Todd Phillips most underappreciated work. Earlier efforts like Old School and Road Trip might nowadays be regularly subjected to a sort of retroactive criticism as a result of the current standards of political correctness, but still stand out as two of the more recognizable pieces of early 2000s era raunch. Meanwhile the Hangover trilogy is straight-up iconic, and even War Dogs receives credit for marking a transition in the director's career into more serious material that quickly opened the door for him to make Joker. This however? It sits alongside School for Scoundrels as a movie no one ever really talks about much, and that's pretty sad.This is a better Hangover sequel than any of the actual Hangover sequels were. Zack Galifianakis is essentially playing the character of \"Alan\" again, only instead of being paired with Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms he's making life very hard for a high-strung version of Tony Stark, who instead of a cool flying supersuit has an expectant wife who's about ready to deliver that he has to get to. Naturally, unforseen consequences force them to drive across country together and plenty of hilarious misadventures ensue.The comedic material ranks among the best Philips has ever concocted. The surprising chemistry between the seemingly mismatched stars allows the angry (on Downey's part) dialog exchanges to land with particularly humorous effect, while the variety of crazy set pieces manage to avoid the laughter reducing overreliance on guns and legitimate danger that plagued so many other releases back in the 2010s (i.e. Identity Theft). The consequences, or actually lack thereof, of some of the more legally questionable exploits carry a noticeable lack of reality (you're telling me nobody put an APB out on that police vehicle stolen at the Mexico border?!), but it never prevents them from being funny.Largely dismissed and overlooked, this looks at first glance like the kind of middle-of-the-road effort so many filmmakers have put out to capitalize on their last big hit, especially given what proceeded it. That's an undeserved misconception however. Due Date held up incredibly well on this rewatch. The amusing concept leads to a lot of crazy scenarios that are adept at cracking you up. It's one of the more wild, riotous comedies I've seen that doesn't need to lean too heavily on sex humor to really push the envelope, just the dynamic of its two leads and the situation they're stuck in. Because of that it's a movie we should all give a collective second look."

      "text": "\"Due Date\" uses the same template as John Hughes' \"Planes, Trains and Automobiles\", but the template is broken now, and it was a perfectly servicable template, even worse, 1987 called because the yesteryear wants its movie back. 1987 wants to know why every comedy being produced from the major studios pander to the lowest common denominator. \"Planes, Trains and Automobiles\", albeit formulaic through and through the entire running time, was able to telegraph its happy ending without the brazen disregard for plausibility that \"Due Date\" is guilty of. Peter Highman(Robert Downey Jr.) is such a city mouse, the a**hole of a city mouse, the filmmaker should just let him be, without having to worry about redeeming him, especially since he's teamed up with a country mouse, the a**hole of a country mouse, who doesn't seem like the same character after both men are asked to leave the plane. At the drop-off area, Ethan Trembly(Zach Galifinakas) is inscrutable; he makes eye contact with Peter, a nonchalance that seems exceedingly bold, coming so soon after the car he arrived in, ripped off the door of the architect's taxi. Later, while both men are standing together curbside, Ethan knocks over Peter's luggage and resigns himself from the common courtesy of picking it up. Once on the plane, Ethan walks to his seat as if the 747 was a yacht he personally owned, placing his carry-on luggage in the overhead compartment  without the slightest acknowledgement that he's fat and an owner of a hirsute belly, haphazardly concealed within a buttoned shirt, aligned strategically with Peter's face, a magnet, as it turns out. \"Due Date\" would have been a whole lot fresher had both men remained formidable opponents, but once they hit the road, the relationship turns hierarchical, in which Ethan stops playing \"dumb\", and Peter asserts himself as the sophisticate who doesn't suffer fools gladly. The words and actions that Peter unleashes on Ethan are so hurtful, so rooted in class consciousness, they practically blow away the \"Planes, Trains and Automobiles\" template to smithereens. The architect's contempt for the budding actor seems just too intense, going so far, at one point, as telling the \"Two and a Half Men\" enthusiast that he despises him \"on a cellular level\". On another occasion, Peter slams Ethan's permed head on a truck, almost hard enough to cause a concussion. In the 1987 John Hughes classic, Neal Page(Steve Martin) may have disliked his accidental companion immensely, but his aversion for Del(John Candy) never coalesced into full-blown hatred. It was John Hughes at his best that the moviegoer didn't mutter to himself, \"Yeah, right,\" when Neal invites the big lug over for Thanksgiving dinner. The late Hughes was a humanist with a pragmatic touch. With its over-reliance on a masturbating dog and drug-related humor for laughs, \"Due Date\" should have played off the sentimental tropes found in \"Planes, Trains and Automobiles\" rather than recast them in such a vulgarian context. It's hard to believe Peter when he says, \"I love you,\" to his fellow traveller, not after Peter spit in Ethan's dog's face and mocks the Arkansasian man for having the rube dream of making it big in Hollywood. He doesn't care about other people. The filmmaker establishes this fact early in the film, as Peter ignores the friendly driver who tries to engage him in a conversation during their jaunt to the airport. We get it. Peter only talks to people he deems worthwhile. A car figures in a later scene, where Peter has second thoughts about ditching his \"friend\" after forgetting to throw out the coffee can containing Ethan's father's ashes. Neal Page would turn around and go back, not Peter Highman, but he turns around anyway, because that's the formula, the steady progression from antagonists to friends, culminating in the scene at the Grand Canyon, where Peter seems exceedingly sensitive while encouraging Ethan to honor his father's last wish, and say goodbye. This is total bulls*it. It feels forced. This loser means nothing to him. But a formula is a formula, which makes you realize how a film like \"Planes, Trains and Automobile\" covers its tracks much better than \"Due Date\", a funny enough film that might have benefited even more had Ethan been allowed to be Peter's sparring partner, not whipping boy. That's the movie we see in the set-up. Interestingly enough, the sparring partner makes a cameo, soon after Ethan gets roughed up by Peter, when a loaded gun that the actor(remember: he's an actor) finds in the glove compartment, accidentally, of course, goes off, and hits the abusive architect in the leg. It's a taste of what \"Due Date\" could have been, and might have been in the original draft: a dark road comedy."

It's actually a descent comedy where two guys are heading to Los Angeles and one of the character wants to headed home so he can see his pregnant wife and another character wants to get high. Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis wasn't half bad in the movie but in a different way that those two guys weren't much funny and I get complaint about Downey Jr for putting him in a so so movie with Zach in it. They have arguments the whole time and the lines aren't there yet (not to The Hangover funny lines). But there's Zach Galifianakis has three funny lines in the middle with spitting the dog line,the truck back line,and the waffles line,which we save him in this picture. But the movie slows down with lack that it refers to the Planes,Trains,and Automobile and it's nothing interesting with the whole cast that actually missing in the movie. But this comedy wasn't worthing to the classic of Road Trip,Old School,and the best box-office winner of The Hangover. You could probably stick to the John Hughes film of Planes,Trains,and Automobiles that it's more funny and it has hearts to those beloved actors of Steve Martin and John Candy at the same time,but this new one wasn't much special and I'm really sorry with those two actors in the movie like that,but it's a least bad you can tell."

I can see how people wouldn't like it. However, I liked it. Has some flavor of What About Bob? - one of my favorite movies. So this man is trying to make it to the birth of his son - needs to travel from Atlanta to LA with limited time on hand. Ends up needing to pair up with a wacky d00d. They are complete opposites, yet strangely they need each other - they help each other to realize that being different isn't so bad and being perfect is over rated, they can make it through their demons/baggage, and, most importantly, they can forgive and love life.It was pretty hilarious and touching too in a dark, bizarre way. I could have done without some predictability and my over all feeling made my literal headache worse, but in a strange way I did enjoy the movie.I'm not into coffee but that whole thing was f*$&#%( funny!Gleenobly's rating: 7/10"
