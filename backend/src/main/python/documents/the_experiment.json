      "text": "This film was intense. It was based off the Stanford Prison Experiment, but if I remember correctly, nobody really died at the end of it, though someone did get removed early, and some of the psychologists actually tried to stop the experiment earlier than 6 days. Great performance by everyone in the cast. But I'm not a big fan of the story, since it seemed a bit melodramatic; the phrase \"that escalated quickly\" really describes this film. I wish they'd actually stuck to the facts instead of aiming for the disgust factor. They made the psychologists look like real genuine gullible idiots in this film; first, they let an ex-convict in (they obviously did not do any background checks), second, they let a potentially psychopathic guy in, third, they took their participants at their word (people lie, it's a fact)."

      "text": "I got this movie after I discovered it was written, produced & directed by the genius behind Prison Break Paul T Scheuring.\r The two leads are brilliant, and it was clear from this film how they were both Oscar winners.\r A couple of the scenes were brutal, overall a good movie, not the best I've ever seen, but I'm glad I bought it."

      "text": "There is only few mistakes: The movie is a bit unrealistic and sometimes the actors are too quiet and should speak louder. But other than that it is a top movie with good acting and humanistic meaning. Especially I like, that the movie focus on the psychological development of the characters."

      "text": "L'Exp\u00e9rience est une sorte de \"jeu\" grandeur nature, un \"test\" \u00e9minemment instructif et \u00e9difiant dans lequel 8 gardiens sont charg\u00e9s de surveiller 12 d\u00e9tenus sous l'oeil attentif des exp\u00e9rimentateurs qui veulent ainsi regarder \u00e0 la loupe, puis \u00e9ventuellement diss\u00e9quer le comportement humain dans une telle situation...C'est inspir\u00e9 de faits r\u00e9els et bien entendu on se doute bien que tout cela va partir en vrille bien vite... On pense \u00e9videmment avant cette \"exp\u00e9rience\" \u00e0 celle de Stanley Milgram sur la soumission \u00e0 l'autorit\u00e9 et la d\u00e9shumanisation stup\u00e9fiante qu'elle a engendr\u00e9e. Ici, le r\u00e9alisateur allemand Oliver Hirschbiegel exploite \u00e0 fond le concept et le creuse \u00e0 l'extr\u00eame.De fa\u00e7on tr\u00e8s progressive, il d\u00e9monte et d\u00e9montre habilement toute la m\u00e9canique qui va mener \u00e0 la violence, au sadisme, \u00e0 la cruaut\u00e9 et \u00e0 l'humiliation. Puis au meurtre. L'ambiance est tr\u00e8s r\u00e9aliste, telle une sorte de quasi-documentaire et si quelques points sc\u00e9naristiques sont sujets \u00e0 caution (le r\u00f4le de la copine, anecdotique et dispensable notamment) si peut-\u00eatre une certaine exag\u00e9ration fait pencher finalement le film vers le thriller plus classique, il n'en reste pas moins que l'objectif recherch\u00e9 est atteint : nous voil\u00e0 sid\u00e9r\u00e9s par cette Exp\u00e9rience qui n'a rien perdu de son impact, bien des ann\u00e9es apr\u00e8s.On retrouve quelques pointures du cin\u00e9ma allemand et la mise en sc\u00e8ne caract\u00e9ristique de Hirschbiegel : plut\u00f4t froide et peu am\u00e8ne en v\u00e9rit\u00e9 mais contrairement au cin\u00e9ma am\u00e9ricain sans aucun effet de manches ou de guimauve superflue. Pas de \"le\u00e7on\" non plus, car les \"faits\" parlent d'eux-m\u00eames et \u00e7a, c'est tr\u00e8s appr\u00e9ciable. Un film passionnant et tr\u00e8s efficace, toujours aussi saisissant."

      "text": "An interesting film that started innocently enough, but gradually started to build up and ended in a proper style. Prison had its own atmosphere and it was made even better by the fact that it was an experiment based on a true story. What I also liked was the brutality at times, which the film didn't shy away from. For me, a good film that I can recommend."
