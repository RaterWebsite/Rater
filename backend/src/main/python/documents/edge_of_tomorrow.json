However, I have to admit that I would've missed a lot had I not seen it. The plot might seem dull at first, especially when you think of Groundhog Day or Source Code, but this is, might I say, definitely one of the best science-fiction works ever. Period.\r Turns out Cruise still has the magic in him, but Blunt is pretty much the major reason why this movie resonates so well with the audience. Without any gigantic marketing gimmicks (in comparison to other summer releases), I really didn't expect the movie to be as good as it is.\r The visual effect is very smooth, the writing is definitely dashing, and for a movie about repetitions, I am surprised that I didn't even want to miss any scene because the humor, action, sci-fi lectures, and suspense work really well altogether. I expected X-Men: DoFP to be my favorite summer hit this year, but I have to say that this movie definitely steals the spotlight. I hope more people turn out to see it because it's something that you don't want to miss at all (despite the rather cliche ending)."

Basically it's Groundhog Day meets War of the Worlds.\r Now I'm a pretty big science fiction fan but I often don't like alien invasion films because the idea that humans are going to win a war against another alien invaders whose technology is hundreds of thousands of years more advanced than us usually falls to some ridiculous idea that although they traveled millions of light years to get here they forgot to check the air or the water before they started their invasion. Edge of tomorrow had a much more creative plot line, which really is the basis of the whole story.\r I liked the film so much that i went back to see it again with a friend.

It's very well directed, the editing is incredibly good, and the pace never lags, which is good for suspend disbelief Sci-Fi movies, one doesn't have time to think about plot holes. Cruise is good, and starts off well playing against stereotype as a sniveling coward. Blunt gets to be tough in a very sexual masculine/feminine role, and buff!

I wasn't particularly satisfied with the ending, but the movie never felt boring and as a whole, I enjoyed it very much. A welcome bi-product of the premise was the feeling that anything could happen to the main character at any time. Other movies often fail to deliver any real feeling of fear or surprise, given that you assume the main character will come out the other side with only a few scratches and bruises. But because the anchor of this story is repeatedly living a single day until he dies, the next fatal blow could be right around the corner. This film also provides some welcome realism in that our hero doesn't miraculously dodge every bullet or perform each maneuver perfectly the first time. I found that the filmmakers highlighted this very well and it provided some believability to an otherwise unbelievable story. At any rate, definitely worth my Saturday afternoon and money."

I will begin by saying that I love Tom Cruise as an action actor and that he is def in my Top 5 actors of all time. Now to the review.\r Acting:\rI will begin by saying that the acting was top notch of course we have Tom Cruise who is Awesome and also Emily Blunt who was Fantastic. I thought the standout was Bill Paxton who was hilarious in the movie and also Brendan Gleeson who was also great with the few parts he had so acting was Superb.\r Story:\rThe story I thought was very well put together about the alien Invasion and by the end of the movie while there was still one question it was pieced together nicely.\r Action Scenes:\rThe action in this movie was Insane it was honestly non-stop from start to finish which I love for a movie like this take all the examples you have seen which combine Starship Troopers and the first scene in Saving Private Ryan and combine them and that is what you get an all out brawl of badass action scenes to rival these movies in particular which are Battle:LA and Battleship which I didn't watch because I heard it sucked but regardless if you love action movies this is def for you.\r Verdict:\rI would recommend this movie to anyone who loves comedy and action movies galore. I would say watch it in IMAX but if you can't just watch it in 2D this is the summer blockbuster to start the summer and possibly beat out all the rest and in my opinion is Tom Cruise's best film since my personnel favorite \"Collateral\"!!!!! A Must See."

It's Groundhog Day with a little Inception and Independence Day all thrown in together and makes for a great experience.  Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt both turn in solid performances as well as the supporting cast.  It would be easy for a movie that focuses so much on repetition to tire quickly, but with EoT it only stays interesting and paces well and keeps your interest.  Many props to the team tasked with the special effects as they're some of the best I've seen in recent years.  There are few things I felt like could have been done better with this movie and if you're only able to see one or two movies this spring/early summer, Edge of Tomorrow should be on your short list to see."

There is no real filler and each scene is important in it's own way.

      "text": "I am no fan of Tom Cruise, especially when cast as a hero. He strikes me as a second hand car salesman; too slick to be true. I had therefore no problem to picture him as the protagonist in this movie: an officer charged with speaking to the media: lacking any combat-experience and intent on staying as far away from any combat zone as possible. When ordered to join the troops in what his superior deems to be a walk-in-the-park landing, Tom blackmails his commander to let him off the hook, which severely backfires on him, for he finds himself soon stripped of rank among the first to land with the reputation of being a deserter who pretended to be an officer to escape his duty.\r The enemy are called mimics for reasons that are never explained in the movie. They resemble metal octopuses, who move at incredible speed, mostly underground. They are aliens and that is about all we learn about them and that is all we need to learn about them. It suffices that they are a deadly force hell-bent on wiping out humanity(some decades in the future, somebody will write a book about how these  inhuman threats are a sign of the times, just like 70s and 80s had their disaster movies).\rD-day quickly turns into a massacre as the aliens wipe out the human forces before they can gain a foothold. Tom dies too, but before he does, he manages to kill one of the rarest of mimics, and finds himself returned to life one day before the landing takes place. Baffled Tom goes through the same day and tries to intervene the course of action in a haphazard way. It doesn't matter that he does because everyone dies.. and he does to.\rAnd then finds himself alive and back in time again.\r And so it goes. With each cycle Tom gets better because he knows what will happen, but also has a lot of time to gain experience, but dies nevertheless again and again.\rHow does he get out of this predicament? He learns with each cycle and eventually he is aided by Emily Blunt, who has suffered from the same effects.\rUp till this sounds like a corny  predictable movie, but the script isn't as easy as you might think. The focus in this movie isn't on the humans vs aliens conflict, but on the interaction between Cruise and Blunt and their frantic efforts to turn the only advantage they have, foreknowledge, against the aliens. The key to their success is actually their ability to convince others that Tom possess that foreknowledge so that they help in the effort. And this is the hardest part.\r The script avoids giving us insight into the alien thinking. The mimics are kept as far away from the camera as possible and we never get a good clear view of them. This is smart for any alien eventually gets boring when shown too often.  An example is the landing, in which a lot of carnage happens before the aliens themselves actually show up.\rThe movie even throws us of the track by introducing a twist in the story that makes the aliens even more sinister. Perhaps everything has been planned beforehand?\r Yet there are flaws in the movie, such as the way Tom ends up in the combat zone. And also the ending is a bit contrived and clearly written to give us a good feel. There is nothing against a movie with a  good ending, but one that forced makes for a lesser ending.\rAlso one wonders why, having the possession of a flying craft at the start of the invasion, Tom and Blunt feel the need to have to get a car and a helicopter further land inward thus getting themselves killed time and again?\r Personally I think that the movie is at its best when Cruise and Blunt are together and it might have been more stronger if more time was to the group of people who aid him so that their characters would have mattered if and when they died.\rMy learning points about this movie would be that some more time could have spent characterizing the people who eventually will aid Tom. Spend less time on the battles in the landing zone and the repeating scenes(which in themselves are shot in a way as to avoid boring repetition, which ought to be mentioned) and give more time to the final attack.\r My ranking gives this a 7 out of 10. This needs an explanation: in it's genre this movie is a 9.. but since ranks are given not to genre or category they are given an overall score. In it's genre of action sci-fi it desevers something of a 9. Which means it is pretty good."

It remarkably manages to rip off so many films and video games whilst feeling refreshingly original also. At times it can feel like a game of spot the original source. In particular the time lapse elements which are very similar to Groundhog Day. If you over think the pattern and repetition of events, you can argue that there are flaws, as with any film of this kind. But it's smartly edited and it moves at such a rampant pace that you don't have time to dissect or question the flaws. Tom Cruise & Emily Blunt carry the film well and it's arguably Tom Cruise's best Sci-Fi to date. Visually this is a spectacular experience and the set pieces are some of the craziest and most exciting I've ever seen, in particular the battles on the beaches which are absolutely incredible. At first glance this just looks like another run of the mill action film with robots. Unlike the Transformers films for example, Edge of Tomorrow gets the human elements spot on and it doesn't rely solely on set pieces. But the set pieces happen to be spectacular too. So it's win-win and definitely worthy of much more recognition."

      "text": "Ignore Critic Reviews, they're all fueled by greed, fear and prejudice.\rOne of the top 3 best movies I've ever seen. When I saw the poster the movie looked strange to me, and I know a lot of people hate Tom Cruise for some reason, but he's a great actor, I'm not big on his older movies but this one was completely organic. I don't know if it's just me but when I watched it again I fully understood what was happening, I noticed a lot of things I missed the first time, the movie is so meticulously written and it's one of those movies everyone has to see, it's up there with The Matrix and Dark Knight. The movie revolves around time travel, it's not vague like you often see in sci-fi where you don't really understand what's happening, it's simple like Groundhog Day, speaking of Groundhog Day this movie is very inspired by Groundhog Day. EoT will make you feel nostalgia, fear, joy, etc. I won't spoilerize anything, all I can say is that it's one of the best movies ever made, it's gritty, it's dark and they did a great job avoiding plot holes, something Days of Future Past was chalk-full of. Avoid the Angry Joe review, he spoils the **** out of every single thing he reviews, he always tells you what happens at the end which ruins the movie/game.\r + Gritty/Dark/Scary\r+ Great acting\r+ Great production\r+ Great plot\r- Not gory enough\r- Action scenes are kind of hard to make out sometimes\r- Music isn't great and memorable like Inception/Dark Knight/Matrix/etc. I always said that music makes a gargantuan difference in quality but this movie did just fine without it"

Based of the novel by Hiroshi Sakurazaka tells such a mysterious,science fiction thriller he goes deep into the science,  that it is really hard to explain nature and science itself.Tom Cruise still has magic in him he does his stunts in this movie i got to say i think its the hardest movie that he has ever done since (Mission Impossible) and when people saw Cruise in this movie you thought it would be terrible cause of he did his previous sci-fi movie Oblivion which people did not like. Emily Blunt! was one of my favorite characters in this movie. Grade A-"
