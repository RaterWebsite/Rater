His lawyer, \"The Lincoln Lawyer\", Mick Haller(Matthew McConaughey), cut a deal with the city prosecutor that spared Martinez's life, so instead of being administered the death penalty by lethal injection, the prisoner can request for a parole hearing in fifteen years. The man in charge of the Renteria case, Detective Kurlen(Michael Pare), believes that Martinez should have been punished corporally. In an elevator, he asks Mickey, \"How do you sleep at night?\" The question is an especially pointed one, because both men are on the same side in their deduction of presumed guilt, but only the detective cares that Martinez did it. For the wrong reasons, the lawyer is able to sleep at night. Mickey doesn't believe in Martinez's innocence, not even after his client pleas tearfully that his case be brought to trial. Why should Mickey fight tooth and nail for a Latino with no money? Mickey could care less if his client stabbed that woman. The case holds nothing for him. It will neither make him rich nor famous. The lawyer can sleep at night because he saved a GUILTY man. He beat the system; he got paid. Those are his core values, the same values which hold true for many men and women in the legal profession. \"The Lincoln Lawyer\" shows how the system is broken. It neatly intertwines the fates of the haves and the have-nots in a legal system that works a lot better for the former. The Lincoln Lawyer, a servant of the court, as shady as they come, undergoes an awakening after he realizes that his blue blood client Louis Roulet(Ryan Phillipe), charged with the attempted murder of a prostitute, was responsible for the killing that sent Martinez to prison as a wrongly convicted felon. Kurlen's words come back to haunt him. \"How do you sleep at night?\" Mickey doesn't believe in his new client's innocence either, and yet he proceeds with the case anyway, since the lawyer is being well-compensated by Louis's mother, Mary Windsor(Frances Fischer), a woman who doesn't care about innocence or guilt either. Along the way, his motivation changes, realizing that he has to prove Roulet innocent to get Martinez off. Initially acquitted of the assault charges, the verdict that rules in Louis' favor shows why our prison system is filled with minorities. That's because the poor and disadvantaged lack the financial resources for proper legal representation. Meanwhile guys like Louis Roulet nearly gets away with murder."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "\"The First Great FILM of the year , stylish , well done , and suspenseful , Matthew McCanoughy gives one of the best performances of his Career filled with twist and turns so great you will not want to leave when its over .

Ryan Phillippe is convincingly amoral and sociopathic and there are enjoyable side performances by William H. Macy and Marissa Tomei.

It honestly seems to me like the role was written for McConaughey, it is that good of a match.

Matthew McConaughey stars as The Lincoln Lawyer Michael Haller, an LA defence lawyer who operates out of the back of his chauffeured Lincoln.\r Employing all sort of tactics to maintain his cash flow, Haller appears brash and without morals as he keeps LA's undesirables out of prison. However, this all changes when he gets drawn into a deadly game of secrets with his latest client, the young, rich Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe).\r The screenplay does it best to squeeze in most of the sentiment and moral dilemmas that the book obviously had more time to focus on. Used to winning, Haller struggles with the dangerous situation as he deals with the complex mix of legal obligations, client and attorney privilege and his previous moral shortcomings.\r McConaughey shines as the charismatic Haller and will hopefully stick to more meaningful roles in the future based on his performance here and that in his upcoming film Killer Joe. His performance is even stronger when viewed in relation to Phillippe's, who doesn't deliver the menace of the book's character. Michael Pena and John Leguizamo provide strong support to the main characters including William H. Macy and Marisa Tomei in typically minor roles.\r Director Brad Furman tries gives some verve to the courtroom scenes with some non-typical angles, but all in all he lets the story play out adequately. The attorney versus client story seemed remarkably similar to that of Ryan Gosling versus Anthony Hopkins in Fracture in 2007.\r A word on the soundtrack, which stays true to the hip-hop references of the book. Connelly explains that Haller's interest in the hip-hop genre stems from his driver Earl. I don't feel that this came across enough in the film and that the soundtrack appears to be a typical 'street' savvy selection of music selected for any LA based film. It is interesting that musical duties fell to Cliff Martinez, who had the same role for Drive, also set in LA, and the two soundtracks could not be further apart with the exception of Kalinsky's 'Nightcall' which appears in both.\r A successful transformation from book to big screen."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I was not expecting such an intelligent film but a great ensemble cast delivered a truly wonderful piece.

Not great, mind you, just solid and satisfying, a movie that asked more of him than rock-hard abs and bleachy-white teeth, one with a touch of grit, a story to chew over and maybe even a beautiful woman who looks real, something like his latest, \u201cThe Lincoln Lawyer.\u201d\r The woman is Marisa Tomei, one of the few higher-profile American actresses in her age group (she was born in 1964, five years before Mr. McConaughey) who\u2019s actually allowed to act her age, who conveys intelligence and sexiness, and suggests a life that\u2019s been lived and without a face frozen by filler and fear. In \u201cThe Lincoln Lawyer,\u201d a thriller adroitly adapted from the Michael Connelly book of the same title \u2014 directed by Brad Furman and written by John Romano \u2014 Ms. Tomei plays a character and not just the love interest. She isn\u2019t the star, of course, but without her and the other exceptionally well-cast supporting players, Mr. McConaughey would have a tougher time making you believe that he was to the sleaze born.\r But, oh, look at him go \u2014 no, cut through the waters \u2014 slicing through the crowds at this and that Los Angeles-area courthouse, a shark in gray suit and loafers. As Mick Haller (Mickey in the books), Mr. McConaughey keeps his focus tight \u2014 Mr. Furman making sure his camera does the same \u2014 doling out empty smiles to the guys with the badges and going straight for the clients whose innocence matters less than their wads of cash. Mick (the hard, short syllable suits him) works out of the back seat of his chauffeured Lincoln Town Car, an itinerant office, good for the rootless. It\u2019s a portable refuge, as much a hideaway as an expression of the man who owns it: sleek, hard, fast and shut off from the world sprawling outside it.\r Mr. Furman gives \u201cThe Lincoln Lawyer\u201d the unpretty look it deserves, turning down the Southern California light so he can throw in some shadows. Save for a golf course where the moneyed hit balls oceanside and a high-ticket office with the usual mausoleum marble, the locations are often homey, sometimes downright homely, textured rather than slicked up. Mick has a killer view from his barely lived-in house in the hills, but he and the movie scarcely seem to notice. Mr. Furman, who made a no-profile feature debut in 2008 with \u201cThe Take,\u201d even offers up another look at downtown Los Angeles, that overexposed movie set, peering behind its towers to where palm trees sway next to tangles of freeway.\r The story, and there\u2019s a lot of it, nicely condensed from Mr. Connelly\u2019s page-turner best seller, largely turns on a case that looks like a slam dunk or, as one of Mick\u2019s bail bondsmen, Val (John Leguizamo), insists, a jackpot. A man (Ryan Phillippe) did or did not beat up a woman, and his Beverly Hills grizzly mama (Frances Fisher) has the right get-out-of-jail card: a fat bank account. The client, Louis Roulet, insists on his innocence, and Mick takes the bait and the money (the same thing). Complications ensue. Mick works the case and chases leads, helped by an investigator (William H. Macy) and dogged by cops with grudges (Bryan Cranston and Michael Par\u00e9). Everything looks pretty clear-cut until it doesn\u2019t.\r Mr. Connelly, a crime reporter turned writer, spun Mick off his author\u2019s popular series about a Los Angeles police detective by the name of Hieronymous Bosch, Harry for short. Though related to dodgy cinematic lawyers like the antiheroes from films like \u201cThe Verdict,\u201d Mick doesn\u2019t feel as if he were being readied for his big redemption. He has a likable ex-wife (Ms. Tomei, as a prosecutor), a young daughter who loves him and even friends. (They all seem to be on the payroll.) But Mr. Connelly doesn\u2019t try to make us love the character, and neither does Mr. Furman. He exploits Mr. McConaughey\u2019s facile charm, pulling us into Mick\u2019s gravitational field, where he first counts the cash and then tries to do good. The cash is the easy part.\r There are modest pleasures in a familiar story told differently enough that you\u2019re happy to keep guessing and watching, despite this one\u2019s five-ending pileup of a finish. Mr. Connelly was inspired by Raymond Chandler, and it shows in Mick\u2019s jaded rap, and it\u2019s likely that Mr. Furman watched Steven Soderbergh\u2019s \u201cOut of Sight.\u201d \u201cThe Lincoln Lawyer\u201d doesn\u2019t approach those heights. But these are first-rate influences, and there\u2019s much to like in how those inspirations have been absorbed, including the wrung-out life that Mr. McConaughey summons up and the sight of Michael Pe\u00f1a, as one of Mick\u2019s old clients, going from freaked-out innocent to stone-cold lifer in a few short scenes. This is an agreeably nasty tale about a corrupt lawyer working all the angles, including, it\u2019s safe to assume, a possible movie franchise."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Film \u00e0 proc\u00e8s proc\u00e9durier tr\u00e8s classique dans sa pr\u00e9sentation avec le bell\u00e2tre sur le retour Matthieu MacCotruc -presque supportable ici- sa femme couguar Marisa Tomei -encore bonne- et le blanc-bec -le jeune bell\u00e2tre- Ryan Bidule...Tr\u00e8s classique \u00e0 ce qu'il semble, car les apparences sont trompeuses : en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le t\u00e9nor du barreau baise son client mais ici, c'est l'inverse qui se produit !

The case in here is quite simpler and doesn't have any unnecessary twists and turns and instead justifies its reasoning with well constructed steps. The screenplay is tight, gripping and adaptive for the viewers to easily connect since it resembles a lot with the known practicality. Having said that, it doesn't suggest in any way, that there aren't tricky and darker take on a lawyer's life, but every bit of tactic they have, is a seen-this-seen-that from such genres. And still in its own terms with McConaughey's calm spirit, it charms away the runtime. It falls flatly on face on technical aspects like cinematography, background score and editing. The camera work is appreciative with a darker theme which may not be appealing for the audience but is palpable to its surrounding and tone. The conversations are bang on money since they are argumentative with debates on ethics and technicality that keeps the viewers tangled in its world. Romano's adaptation might have missed the essential soul from the book but it does capture its characters aptly which is then celebrated by the cast. The director Furman has executed well enough to create the anticipated impact with a hardcore world which may not run on rules but is still fueled with ethics. As mentioned earlier, the strength of the cast affects a lot with McConaughey at the heart of it pumping harder and faster than ever and is supported well by Tomei, Macy, Cranston and Pena, who steals the spotlight in his limited time.

Also there are multiple scenes involving a Hells Angels group of bearded men in large motorcycles who seem to be mates with said lawyer.There are numerous characters present throughout, who have their own angle, interests to defend etc. it did feel quite confusing trying to make sense of the case and get a feel for who may be concealing what about the true events behind the case. The motives of different people aren't made entirely clear until quite late on and there are some surprising moments, if you can stick with it to the end but I certainly wouldn't say its the most enthralling watch I've, um, watched.I found myself with a bit of a wry smile as I realised there's a somewhat ironic theme or question posed by it - that being which can you trust more, so called prison snitches or accused criminals on one hand or lawyers who obviously represent the accused. Its well known that in America (and likely elsewhere, generally), lawyers aren't especially trusted or necessarily well regarded and of course there are other such movies that include this rather fundamental doubt or question but this one I thought was quite interesting in terms of the angle it takes, in as much as its not all about the accused and the trial but moreso about the lawyer, his different clients and the way he backed himself up, how he viewed the system and things. I didn't find Mick to be an entirely likeable character funnily enough, he comes across as being all about who you know and maintaining a reputation no matter what - if anything, I'd say I found the movie to be somewhat 'clinical', which put me off, although the plot has one or two interesting twists, especially towards the end where there were some rather shocking twists, which may well be less expected than earlier ones. I thought it was pretty watchable but as I say it was a little cinical or, to use another term, perhaps slightly bland in substance in parts when going over some details. I felt that the first half of the movie was a bit clinical, as I say, although the pace does build up somewhat and as I say, there were more sudden, surprising plot twists present towards the end, which made it more interesting. I'm not sure what else I can say about it really - to me it was ok, I thought that Matthew McConaughey did pretty well in portraying the rather arrogant and self assured lawyer, he came across well on screen I suppose, seeming quite convincing, the real issue to me was that I didn't particularly like the main characters and I suppose in a sense I felt rather indifferent to what the outcome would be. I suppose I also had hoped it might be more of a crime drama/thriller but it was less of that and more of a crime mystery, as I say. Before I end this section, I'll add that cast wise, this title features numerous highly regarded actors including Ryan Phillippe, William H. Macy and Bryan Cranston (of Breaking Bad fame) and its running time is approximately an hour and 55 minutes long, which I'd say nowadays seems to be about the average running time of a movie, particularly one with a slightly complicated story like this.Overall, personally no I wouldn't recommend it. I thought it was alright - there are some good plot twists and the acting is decent enough but the script was a bit too bleak perhaps for my personal liking. I found it to be a bit too slow pace wise for certainly the first half of the movie and the characters, while numerous, were maybe a bit too shady? I'm not sure but I can certainly say that it didn't really 'grab me' and it definitely isn't a movie I'm likely to think about or want to re-watch again. Maybe I have something against sytlised movies - I do wonder sometimes but thats just me. Its watchable but not as good as other movies, I'd say. I can't really think of anything much else to add to be honest but I couldn't specifically recommend it, although other people may find following the plot and seeing the various plot twists be played out, more enjoyable and find it more intriguing and enthralling than I did - to me it was distinctly average."}], "recommendations": ["fracture", "arbitrage", "donnie_brasco", "widows", "knives_out", "the_judge", "the_town", "stillwater", "conspiracy_theory", "prisoners", "child_44", "the_accountant", "breach", "the_little_things", "white_boy_rick", "the_next_three_days", "insomnia", "the_fugitive", "primal_fear", "triple_9", "secret_window", "son_of_a_gun", "the_raven", "black_and_blue", "hotel_artemis"]}
