The character is exactly how I would think a dead exorcist pervert **** would act coming along with all his mischief and tricks up his sleeve making for some pretty creepy sequences that are just past the line of being hysterical as well as slightly terrifying. I only wished they'd do more exploration in the world of the afterlife as there seems to be so much potential for a world there (I'd imagine this was further explored in Burton's Corpse Bride but it should've been in this movie as well)"

It is certainly not easy being dead and this feel exemplifies that. The world created here by Tim Burton is wacky as expected and has so many layers to explore that shows just how expansive and creative this film is. Michael Keaton is over-the-top, yet hysterical and Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis do a great job as the bumbling idiots who recently died. Winona Ryder is also great here. The writing here is also very strong as it manages to wring every possible joke out of the pretty dark premise. Overall, Beetlejuice shows very little signs of aging and remains a funny, enjoyable ride."

While its cheesy at times, the film is perfect for something to watch when you just want to sit back and laugh. Nothing to think about, but nothing to miss out on either."

Thus, to evict them and regain possession of their home, they decide to scare and haunt the newcomers, which can be challenging for a rookie ghost. To do this, they have the help of experienced ghosts and two unusual allies: the daughter of the new house owners and another ghost, deeply unorthodox and expert in the art of scaring the living.The film is a classic comedy of black humor, which plays with death and life in the beyond, just as it makes a great mockery to the pseudo-intellectuals of American society. The movie is very funny. I confess I had never seen or heard of him until I found him, by chance. Directed by Tim Burton, there are a lot of elements that we associate, almost instinctively, with this director: an unusual plot with offbeat themes, a comedy difficult to please everyone, out of the box sets and costumes and a refined, fun and contagious soundtrack.The cast did a great job. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin have done well in the role of the ghost couple. They interact very well with each other and have created a positive and credible romantic chemistry. Besides, they're funny. Michael Keaton has the most difficult and original character here: the spiritual de-worzler Betelgeuse (Beetle Juice), an irreverent, talkative and daring ghost who loves to scare humans and promises to be truly difficult to control when he's released. Winona Ryder, once a regular in Burton's films (remember \"Scissorhands\"), is quite good at playing the rebellious daughter of the new owners of the house, which, for a reason the film never explains, has the ability to see and speak with them, as if she were a medium.Overall, this movie was a pleasant surprise. Very funny, contagious and cheerful, it will surely drive anyone to laughing laughter."

'The Ghost with the Most' is brought back from the afterlife thanks to Tim Burton's twisted imagination and the wacky writings of Michael McDowell and Warren Skaaren. In order to rid themselves of a pesky new family, a recently deceased couple hires the obnoxious ghoul Beetlejuice to perform a \"bio-exorcism\" and earn back their house! BEETLEJUICE is filled with oddball characters and eccentric performances from the entire cast. HOME ALONE's Catherine O'Hara is wickedly funny as the family's New Age hipster wife, who is married to Jeffrey Jones in another of his quirky character roles. A young Winona Ryder plays their morbid daughter Lydia, the one person who is able to communicate with the dead. And then, of course, there is Michael Keaton in the most unusual and unexpected performances of his career. Beetlejuice is crass, vulgar, and disgusting... And we love him! He is the undead equivalent to the classic Acme characters pushed to their fiendish extremes. The make-up and special effects are superb and highly original, combining traditional stop-motion animation with modern prosthetics to bring each of the otherworldly creatures back to life. Like GREMLINS and GHOSTBUSTERS before it, BEETLEJUICE is another classic comedy that 80's horror fans are sure to love!\r -Carl Manes\rI Like Horror Movies"

Its very well written and imaginative, its got just the right amount of Burton craziness and its got some timeless jokes in it that are still funny after over 25. There are several strong characters in this film Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis and a young Winona Ryder are all great, but Michael Keaton is the real star of the show. Keaton's portrayal of the titular character is one of the most memorable of his character, but the real tragedy is how underused he is. Beetlejuice is the perfect example of a live-action cartoon character and the last 30 minutes of the movie when he has the most involvement are certainly the best. The lack of Keaton though keeps this movie at a good level, not a great level."

      "text": "My favorite Tim Burton movie and a true classic I rewatch from time to time. It is a fantasy comedy with horror elements and a truly great cast. The abstruse situation, humor and characters create a unique movie experience. Be warned Tim Burton the director is famous for his unique style but not everyone likes it. For me this is not a problem as I am a fan of most of his movies. The story follows Barbara and Adam Maitland on their way to their country home near the town Winter River in Connecticut. They have a car accident and when they return home they recognize a \u201cHandbook for recently deceased\u201d atop on other things. Obviously they died at the accident and have to deal with deceased bureaucracy so bad even German authorities cant compete with (I am German so I know about this). Things get serious when the house is sold to the Deetz family which consist of Charles his wife Delia and goth daughter Lydia. I stop here to avoid spoilers. Like I already said it is a fun, enjoyable and unique story. It works from start to finish and I cant remember a week moment. The great actors and humor make this an incredible experience. Lets continue with the actors aka characters. Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice (actually written as Betelgeuse) is absolutely awesome. One of his best performances and truly remarkable. Then we have the Maitlands with Geena Davis as Barbara and Alec Baldwin as Adam. Both are great and fully deliver their roles. They work so well together. The Deetz are also great as Jeffrey Jones as Charles and Catherine O\u2019Hara as Delia are totally selling the love to hate characters. Wiona Ryder as Lydia is another favorite and rivals Beeteljuice for best character of the movie. We have an awesome cast of actors that deliverer a truly good performance. Of cause I have to praise director Tim Burton too and extend this to the whole team behind the screen. The practical effects were amazing for its time and aged well. The special effects while being good did age a bit but still work for me. I think the art style and effects in general improve the movie. Overall I consider it as a must see movie. The style, story, humor and actors are too good to be missed. A sequel was announced for 2022 but I fear they cant recreate this success."

Essentially it is a landmark supernatural comedy as well as being a refreshingly flaky fantasy crammed with wit and invention, that I think is one of Tim Burton's better films along with Batman, Ed Wood and Edward Scissorhands. It is also a marvellously imaginative view of the afterlife as a ghoulish extension of mundane earthbound problems. The visuals once again are absolutely wonderful, with dark cinematography, imaginative sets and zany special effects. The script are filled to the brim with one-liners that are funny and somewhat demonic, the score from Danny Elfman is fun and the direction is pretty much superb. And I loved how offbeat the performances were, with Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis suitably low key as the recently deceased couple who want to rid their new home of human pests. Speaking of those human pests, Catherine O' Hara proves herself fantastically pretentious as the artist whose creations come to life in one of the film's most memorable scenes, and Jeffrey Jones and Winona Ryder are also memorable but it is Michael Keaten as Bettelgeuse, the unstable freelance exorcist who steals the show who portrays the character as unique and completely and utterly insane. Overall, unique, imaginative and lots of fun. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

      "text": "Bottom line: Classic Tim Burton film that makes for a solid evening around Halloween.\r Adam (Baldwin) and Barbara (Davis) Maitland are a young, recently married couple. They are vacationing at home and make the quick trip to the local hardware store. On their way back they crash off a bridge into a river. Somehow, they walk back to their house (though they don\u2019t exactly remember how) and, drenched, they try to dry off and warm next to the fire they don\u2019t remember starting. They soon realize they drowned in the river and are now ghosts. They still want to try and live, or exist, happily in their home. Unfortunately, a new family (the Deetz\u2019s) from New York buys the house and starts to move in. The Maitland\u2019s decide to haunt the house to scare away the unwelcome residents. After repeated failures, they resort to calling Betelgeuse (Keaton), a freelancer who turns out to be far more trouble than he\u2019s worth.\r Beetle Juice is, for me, one of those movies that you actually sit down and watch once but you see it in parts here and there. I first saw Beetle Juice when I was little and I thought it was creepy and somehow depressing. After re-watching it just the other day, I still think it is creepy and depressing but I will say that it is good.\r The acting is really rather good. I had forgotten that it was starring a very young Alec Baldwin. As soon as he spoke, I did a double take and thought, \u201cI think I recognize that amazing voice.\u201d Michael Keaton does a really good job at creating Betelgeuse a unique character. I didn\u2019t realize it was him until I looked at the credits. It was like learning that Tim Curry played Pennywise the Clown in Stephen King\u2019s It. It is a combination of makeup and acting to create something new. Winona Ryder fits perfectly into the aesthetic of the film. It made me wonder why she didn\u2019t do more stuff with Tim Burton.\r Beetle Juice is one of the few movies that ends with a dancing sequence that I don\u2019t particularly find offensive. Lydia received an \u201cA\u201d on her Chemistry paper so the Maitland\u2019s possess the house so it plays Harry Belafonte\u2019s \u201cJump In The Line\u201d and possess Lydia to make her float in the air and dance. Many of the dancing sequences I\u2019ve seen use the opportunity to cycle through the characters as they dance to show their status. In Beetle Juice, we cycle through the characters but they aren\u2019t dancing. They are just doing what they would normally be doing: Lydia\u2019s mom is sculpting some modern art and Lydia\u2019s father is reading. It is mildly silly but it isn\u2019t going for a zany ending.\r Overall, I\u2019d recommend Beetle Juice if you haven\u2019t seen it before but, considering it has been on TV about a million times, you probably have. Would I recommend you see it again? If it is Halloween time, sure, why not? It isn\u2019t a scary movie and in terms of humor, it\u2019s alright. I didn\u2019t laugh out loud but chuckled here and there."

      "text": "This is one of Tim Burtons relatively early movies, I believe, dating from the mid-late 80s. The movie definitely has quite a dated feel to it although I did think that this added to its appeal somehow. There's no CGI here, instead its mainly puppets (animatronics?) used I think. There isn't much in the way of strong language or violence, its mainly got the 15 rating due to the 'gross out factor' I suppose, with the scenes where Adam and Barbara join other dead people and try to seek help and when they try their hand at haunting their houses new inhabitants, smulating hanging themselves etc., though it has limited success. This is where some of the humour comes from in a way, so you can already tell that this isn't a movie for everyone, however I quite like that it is a movie that isn't by any means trying to take itself seriously and I did quite enjoy the crudeness of it, I suppose you could say. I also found it amusing the use of quite lively music, the main track being 'Jump in the Line (Shake Se\u00f1ora)' by Harry Belafonte. The scenes featuring this track are likely to make fans of Burtons movies laugh, watching what happens at the dinner table to the family when Beetlejuice decides to have a bit of fun. So yes there is humour and there is a creepy element to it too, of course and I thought that overall it had quite a clear comic book feel to it, its not really an overly scary or threatening type movie, as long as your not a young child anyway, I think its clearly not for young children who would be scared by a few scenes, particularly when Adam and Barbaras faces are changed quite dramatically towards the end. It is quite an 'enthusiastic' movie I suppose you could say, one that shows that Tim Burton clearly has or had a vivid imagination and I liked the tone of the movie, it seemed at least fairly original and I thought it was an interesting concept. Going by memory I think there may have been a spin-off cartoon series for kids made based on the movie featuring the characters from it, which makes sense, I can see how that could work, though presumably Beetlejuice isn't quite as randy in the cartoon as he is in the movie! (whether or not ghosts can fancy ghosts of the other gender, I have no clue lol).The character of Beetlejuice isn't featured as heavily as I presumed he would be in the movie but it still worked quite well, I feel. The title of the movie may be a little misleading for some I suppose though, since the main character isn't really Beetlejuice himself, although he provides the main entertainment and the quirkiness I suppose, the main characters are of course Adam and Barbara and then Lydia. However, the scenes with Beetlejuice are pretty hyperactive and engrossing, so its worth sticking with the movie for that.The character of Lydia reminded me of the Adams' Family character of Wednesday, infact I suppose you could compare the movie to one of the Adams' Family movies in a sense, with the rather quirky house and the disfunctional family, Beetlejuice could be seen as a kind of an amalgm or combination of Gomez (in terms of a certain kind of sexual charm or so he'd think he has) and Uncle Fester (in terms of creepiness, really!).Overall, quirky and darkly amusing are the words I think that best describe this movie. It is quite an interesting movie and I found it pretty entertaining, its not a particularly scary movie as such but I wouldn't recommend letting any children watch it all the same, still if this is your sort of thing then you should definitely check it out.Yes I would, as I say above. It felt fairly original and was entertaining and kind of amusing in parts. The plot concept was interesting and it is quite lively in parts too, though if im to be picky then I could criticise it for being a little bland mid way through the movie, before they went to seek help and discover their 'case worker' and before the title character appeared. It does have a somewhat dated feel to it but it doesn't take away from its appeal and I still found it quite entertaining overall, hence why I'd recommend it. Of course, not everyone likes Tim Burton movies and if your not one for this sort of thing then obviously, give this a miss but otherwise its worth a watch."

I don't watch it for the effects, I love the character of Betelgeuse and the other characters are so well defined that you either love or hate them just the way you should in a film. It is dark and funny. It is not normal and that is why it is so good."
