Not as detailed as some animation (example - you can't see the horses hair, it is just a solid color) but I actually appreciate that.  I know I'm watching animation.  The story is simple, but characters well developed.  Nice to see an animated film not relying on bathroom humor that is loud and hectic.  Despite what some critics say, this is a family film that all ages will appreciate.  I'm not sure the Bryan Adams songs were needed or added that much to the film, but they weren't distracting either."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Spirit has spirit, and the movie glides along well.

The animation is really top notch, and the soundtrack is stirring and memorable. The story relies a little too heavily on narration, and can really drag at times. It's almost like watching a beautiful painting of the American Frontier more than a movie. It's still enjoyable, and highly memorable."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "With striking visuals and an amazing narration, Stallion Of The Cimarron is as underrated as you think it would be.

That being said some great animation and nice show don\u2019t tell moments help bring you into the world of the film making it enjoyable to watch at least once. This isn\u2019t one of my favorite 2-D animated films from Dreamworks but it is still entertaining enjoyable enough to watch at least once. It\u2019s a rent. Some may like/love it while others may not. As for me its alright not a bad film but at the same time nothing spectacular."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "En voyant Spirit, on se dit que l'ensemble aurait pu \u00c3\u00aatre sublime, s'il n'avait pas \u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 quelque peu b\u00c3\u00a2cl\u00c3\u00a9 sur certains points. A commencer par un sc\u00c3\u00a9nario certes sympathique et moralisateur, mais les sc\u00c3\u00a8nes s'encha\u00c3\u00aenent trop vite, emp\u00c3\u00aachant de s'attacher \u00c3\u00a0 la majorit\u00c3\u00a9 des personnages et \u00c3\u00a0 l'histoire elle-m\u00c3\u00aame. De plus, ce film abuse excessivement des d\u00c3\u00a9cors et effets num\u00c3\u00a9riques. C'est bien dommage car cela g\u00c3\u00a2che des animations en dessin superbes que les nouveaux films Disney ne pourraient renier. Il n'y a qu'\u00c3\u00a0 voir les expressions de chaque animal, arrivant \u00c3\u00a0 parler avec le visage et non la voix (et oui, point d'animaux qui parlent!). Mais le meilleur que l'on peut retenir de ce Spirit, c'est bien l'ambiance musicale, tout simplement exceptionnelle : l'association des th\u00c3\u00a8mes de Hans Zimmer et des chansons de Bryan Adams fait des ravages et ce durant l'int\u00c3\u00a9gralit\u00c3\u00a9 du film. En somme, Spirit reste un dessin anim\u00c3\u00a9 de bonne facture, mais qui m\u00c3\u00a9ritait bien plus."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Although the rather sentimental tone and ill-fitting score let it down, Spirit nonetheless demonstrates DreamWorks' knack for creating sweeping vistas and stunning animation."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I don\u2019t understand why some people are hating on this movie. Although there is little dialogue, you get a break from the annoyingly scripted, cheesy, movies and you get to watch for yourself this story and journey unfold. The simple narration is because it is in fact a children\u2019s movie people. This movie is heart wrenching and for some reason people don\u2019t like that. If you want to watch a dull movie with a predictable plot just go watch the Lego movie or something. This movie is a classic and not to mention the soundtrack is amazing. I think some people just don\u2019t like Bryan Adams. Those who appreciate music can agree that regardless of Bryan, you can\u2019t deny that Hans Zimmer did an amazing job with the musical choreography that makes this story come alive. Children also get a brief history lesson on the American Indian (Native American) War. While it is very stereotypical, they at least get a peak into what another culture might look like. This movie is emotional, intense, and heartfelt. I watched it many times as a kid and would still watch it now."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "It was a good movie, i'll try not to use bad language but yea I think they should have kept a lot of music out of it...because most of it they didn't need, i like horses, Spirit Rocks, but I found out what his dad was and his mom was like a yellowish, and whitish hair..he would have to be Gray with a whitish hair.....so yea bad science!"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Spirit is a fantastic movie! I think it really tells the story of the American West, from the heart of the horse, not the cowboy. I have ridden a mustang before, and he had as much passion as I saw out of Spirit in the movie. The music is wonderful! Bryan Adams did a great job on every song he was in, and the music anywhere in the movie is perfect. Spirit reminds me of my horse Roscoe, he has the same attitudes as Spirit. Great movie! Deserves a 20!!!!"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Awesome animation, coupled with a touching story.. and to think it was conveyed with so less a narration, is amazing.

With a soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and a quiet development, though far from fantastic, Spirit is one of DreamWorks' most underrated works."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Spirit is a movie that, while it doesn't break new standards in story or graphics, unlike other classic animated films in the late '90s and early 2000s, is really one that stands out with some merits of its own. Thanks to a good combination of elements inspired by other movies. Partly it reminds me of Bambi since the movie spends a long, long time showing you situations with the characters and the settings, without saying a word. However, in my opinion, this movie has almost the opposite tone to Bambi, since although this is much more calm and relaxing, Spirit is much more action-oriented, with many situations that will leave you excited and excited constantly. I love everything that can be empathized with Spirit. I think it's been a long time since I empathized with such a protagonist, at least thanks to his facial expressions. I would even go as far to say that he would be a totally different if it didnt have this. The other characters are good, although they don't have the charm that Spirit has, in my opinion.I only have two problems with this movie, its villain and its graphics... yes, its graphics... at least only part of it. Incredible that i would point as a negative point the graphics, in a 2d animated movie of the \"post-classic\" era, being almost classic eh? But don't get me wrong, I think the movie is beautiful overall. The only problem I have is the first 10-20 minutes. They tried to make a 2d/3d evolution of what was already seen in other movies like Treasure Planet. The problem is that I feel that in these few minutes of the movie, the settings and the characters seem to be made of paper. They don't look as natural, they look a bit flat and the environment looks like something out of an N64 game. Fortunately in the rest of the scenes all this is compensated, but I never thought I would criticize something like that in a 2002 animated movie. Treasure Planet, Beauty And Beast, Atlantis or even Tarzan did not have these problems.The last problem, also somewhat minor is his villain. The colonel or leader of the soldiers, whatever you want to call him. Well, actually he is together with Spirit the best built character in the movie, and that really helps Spirit to show the \"Edgy\" side of him that stands out so much, but at the end of the movie he decides... to forgive him? As if he was admitting defeat to him or something? I think it was a somewhat forced way to get rid of him. The whole movie made us hate him, so that we empathize with him?Anyway... Spirit... good movie. It does not innovate, and it is not perfect, but it is charming and beautiful enough and that is enough for me. It's not as good as Shrek as some say, but it doesn't need to be. This year was possibly the end or almost the end of 2d classic animated movies, and movies like this are highly appreciated. I know I left many things to comment but I think this is the most important. I write my reviews in a hurry, I know, lol."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This is definitely one of Dreamwork's most underrated films. I just saw it and I think it was really good. I could talk all day about the animation and how impressive a lot of shots and sequences are. While the movie is short I felt like it was paced well and the story flowed pretty smoothly. The problem with its short length is the character stuff, because besides Spirit, any other character is just a plot device (Well, probably Little Creek wasn't as one-dimensional as the rest of the characters. At least he had an understandable motivation). The music is pretty good and some of the songs were also pretty good, even if a couple of them were pop-rock kinda songs that didn't fit the tone.I like the concept of it being a story with animals that don't speak, I think it was to show how animals do have feelings even if they can't speak (which is one of the main arguments in favor of animal cruelty: \"They don't feel pain because they can't say they're in pain\"). I feel like that is so powerful to me and it has some emotional moments that were really effective. However, while I love the concept of not having them speak, there's a narrator (Who's supposed to be Spirit) and that's probably my biggest issue with the movie: The narration. It was genuinely obnoxious because it was so redundant. The narration serves no purpose other than to explain what we are literally watching onscreen. For example, Spirit is captured by the villains and the narrator says: \"I was captured by these men and I was scared\"...Like...You don't say, dude.Other than that I recommend this movie. It's not a masterpiece, but it's a movie that was made with love and effort. It has a cute message about animal liberation that I think it was communicated in a great way. I know this is intended to be for kids and the story needs to be easy to understand, but I guess that they could just remove the narration."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "It's that one movie the weird horse girl in class loved so much and she wouldn't stop taking about, it's not as good as El Dorado or Sinbad."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "impeccable production as is already the custom of DreamWorks.
