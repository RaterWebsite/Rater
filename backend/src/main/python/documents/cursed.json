It is a favorite of mine and one that I watch every October when I am watching my Halloween collection of movies. The well-known actors (Christina Ricci, Joshua Jackson, Milo Ventimiglia, Jesse Eisenberg, Portia de Rossi, Judy Greer, Michael Rosenbaum) are great, not to mention the dog Zipper (Solar). The movie is certainly not the same-O, same-O werewolf movie. And it is kind of fun having it take place in the Hollywood Scene with some actors and singers playing themselves. I recommend it to anyone who wants to see a good movie for the Halloween Season. My only problem with it is that they never made a sequel."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This is one of my favorite movies!If you love campy horror flicks, you will LOVE this movie. It has a collection of B-list stars who all do great in their campy roles. Christina Ricci is amazing and adorable, and you will be entertained during the whole movie.This has to be one of the only Werewolf movies that I actually like and doesn't go too deep into the myths and legends. The characters are all believable and the world the movie portrays is a place I would love to live in. We all know Wes Craven can do horror, this is his answer to the campy B movies that have come out, and he does excellent!If you're looking for some edge of your seat thriller, this isn't for you.

It was good, momentarily scary, with laughs. Ricci was convincing in her role as the leading lady. She played the part well. Jesse Eisenberg, who plays her brother, did a good job in the movie as well, he looked like he did his research for the role. As far as thrills goes it was momentarily scary, but when it comes to the scenes with the werewolves, they could have been more gore and violence. The movie focused on comedy more than thrills. Although the comedy was put in at the right times it still did could have been good without it. The movie does keep you on the edge of your seat and you really care about the characters. It has a few plot twists which makes it more suspenseful. The final scene makes the whole movie worth your while, it is raw and very violent. If you are looking for a good movie you got one.

His character and his scenes with Jimmy were my favorite. The film seemed more like an 80s or 90s movie and I'm surprised it came out in 2004.
