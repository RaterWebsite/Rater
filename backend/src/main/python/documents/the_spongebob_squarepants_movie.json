I asked my parents to let me see it and the story line made me think that it would be bad again.  When I watched it I was shocked by it, it was really good and I loved it.  The original humor and the wide variety of new characters made me love it even more.  I find it to be a great family movie, not just for kids, adults probably would enjoy it too."

      "text": "This is an animated movie that often gets overlooked and forgotten but should be remembered as a modern comedy classic. What is most overlooked, and surprising is the depth and narrative heft of the film. The Spongebob Movie is often hilarious, gleefully silly, and surprisingly deep. It may never get the accreditation it deserves, but the Spongebob Movie is a film that should be re-evaluated, and maybe it would gain recognition as a underlooked animated gem.\r The humor in the Spongebob Movie maybe directed at children, but it would take a joyless person who takes life way too seriously not to find the film funny. The jokes are inventive and come early and often. The film is a perfect manifestation of the TV show in filmic form, without feeling like a bloated episode. It\u2019s also great, because in an age when animated TV Shows have begun to cater more to stoners than children, including the latter, this movie still has an appeal for everybody.\r The film is gleefully silly, which only makes the film that much funnier. Admittedly there are a few moments when the film oversteps the threshold of what is funny, and what is over-the-top, but for the most part the film maintains a fun tone. One of the single greatest strengths of is the villain, Dennis, who\u2019s one of the funniest villains of all time. The sheer stupidity of some characters, matched with the deadpan seriousness of Dennis makes every scene he\u2019s in, even more hilarious.\r Above the humor, The Spongebob Movie is also surprisingly deep, in both character development and the film\u2019s message. While viewers may not think about these things while watching Spongebob, the film has a great message about growing up, and how the world can forget to be silly every once and awhile. The film is actually a really great portrait of today\u2019s society, and how everybody feels the need to grow up so fast instead of embracing their inner child.\rThis is a movie that can get overlooked by adults, because it\u2019s silly and childish, but as a reflection of the society, the film is brilliant. The film is funny, and is a great film to sit back and watch with the family. For the best viewing experience one should embrace their inner child, which isn\u2019t as bad as some would try to make it sound. In the end The Spongebob Movie should be considered a comedy classic, as it\u2019s exponentially funnier than some of the best comedies today."

This movie had some action,even though there couldve been some more with spongebob,humor, and best of alll....david hasselhoff! i dont see why everyone wants to kill spongebob, hes a harmless,nice character that even though mr.krabs dissed him he still wants to help. I recommend seeing this movie, spongebob sometimes isnt as funny in the tv show and i barely laugh at it sometimes, but now when i saw this movie it has funny and clever humor. It wasnt a waste!!!!! it gets you entertained and it had some surprises. People who said this is lame, do not know what fun is..... the surprise ending made me like spongebob more,okay its your opinion. But it was not that pointless, give the writers a break...guys!"

      "text": "This is THE best animated film based on a TV series. It's everything Spongebob fans could hope for, with wild, zany animation, delightfully cheery voice acting, hilariously disturbing scenes (i.e. Patrick's melting face), and and a wild plot that actually works and builds suspense towards the end, which is rare for animated films. Every character is perfectly characterised; Plankton is evil (even more so in this film, which makes it even better), Patrick is the lovable oaf as characterised in the early seasons, Spongebob is naive and an animated hero who is so fun here that you actually root for him, etc. The film's emotional scene towards the end is probably one of the best scenes in the film, and one in which the theme is made perfectly clear: Even if you're seen in a negative light by others, you can still do wonders when you commit yourself to achieving a goal. The song by Ween called \"Ocean Man\" is a perfect fit for the ending credits; it always fills you with a sense of joy when it starts playing. The Spongebob Squarepants Movie is the perfect ending to the pre-movie episodes, which is what I consider to be the real series. Everything after is a bad fan-fiction. 10/10."
