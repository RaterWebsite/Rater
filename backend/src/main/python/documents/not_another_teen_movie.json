      "text": "This is a good parody/comedy movie,The acting is not convincing (that's the point) and what is happening in the movie is barely impossible but it's just a parody and it is suppose to be pretty bad and dumb."

      "rating": "3",
      "text": "I can't deny - there were some hilarious moments that made me laugh hard, but overall.. dumb movie. \"Not another teen movie\" - yeah right, it is defenitely not another teen movie, because you can tell that most teen movies leave you with smile on the face or at least are  decent. I'm not spoiling, but.. deep kissing grandma, for real? If you want to watch a good \"teen movie\", then I would recommend you - \"Mean girls\", \"10 things I hate about you\", \"The house bunny\", \"A Cinderella Story\" and \"She is the man\". This crap doesn't deserves your attention."

      "text": "It advertise itself like a spoof of the modern spoof movie like the Suckerberg movies, yet they seem to understand the spoof genre as much as all the other  spoofs. Very unfunny and horribly written."

    {
      "rating": "10",
      "text": "I've only seen a handful of the movies that this parodies, yet still find this one of the most funny and repayable stupid comedies out there. No American Pie morality, no underlying sub-plots, just pure stupid jokes, crammed in T&A and the odd offensive gag in there to add the slight edge here (although that is very underplayed).  I absolutely love this film and the way it drags cheesy yank rom-coms down to the level of us every-day Joe's. A classic."

      "rating": "6",
      "text": "Going into this movie you have to learn not to take it too seriously. It's a parody of teen movies and is hilarious at parts but overall it still felt like just any other teen movie. I will give it a 58.5 out of 100."

    {
      "rating": "8",
      "text": "This movie is so hilarious. It will be a lot more funny to you if you seen all the movies that this is making fun of. I can't remember all the movies off the top of my head, but I know it's Varsity Blues, American Beauty and Bring It On to name 3 at least."
