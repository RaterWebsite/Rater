Viggo Mortensen received a long deserved Oscar nom for his ability to get into his character's skin on this one. Well worth the watch and will put you on the edge of your seat; as well as open-a closed mindset."

The movie started out in typical Cronenberg fashion with stilted dialogue and characters but then it seemed to coalesce for the most of the rest of the movie around the plot and the character that Viggo Mortensen plays. Viggo does a great job of embodying this man, he seems like a guy who has been in a Russian prison and he overcomes his pretty boy looks to great effect. Naomi Watts is a little stereotyped as the nurse character and is not quite as believable though she is nice to look at and doesn't detract from the movie overall. This is more conventional than the usual Cronenberg movie and I think that in this case this was a good thing."

Yes, there are certain gaps in the script that are never brought to light, but to focus only on that is to miss the entire point of the film. It's not attempting to be an episode of CSI. It's more of an exploration of the polarities between right and wrong. It reveals humanity in the most improbable places. People need to understand that THIS IS A MOVIE. A piece of art is not intended to immaculately recreate reality, but rather illuminate an underlying message. So, to anyone reading this, do yourself a favor and focus on the poignancy of the story as opposed to the forensic inconsistencies. This is a great, worthwhile film, with superb acting by Mortensen to boot."

The writing is so precise and subtle, with hints of foreshadowing, brilliant dialogues, and outstanding character development for all the major players. The acting is superb all around, with Mortensen and Mueller-Stahl shining the most. The directing, too, is very precise, especially in scenes that you can tell are impossibly hard to convincingly piece together (i.e. the bath-house fight). Watching the film a second time, you can really pick up on many of the subtleties that reflect the complexity and brilliance of all the aspects of this film. Eastern promises has a great shot at getting Oscar nominations for Viggo Mortensen (actor), Mueller-Stahl (supporting actor), and original screenplay, but I wouldn't be surprised if it snagged a couple extras as well."

      "text": "People are going to hear a lot about this, so I may as well begin with it: There's a fight scene in David Cronenberg's Russian mob thriller \"Eastern Promises\" that is sure to go down as a raw, brutal and pulse-pounding landmark in the history of fight scenes. It takes place in one room, with no props except for a couple knives. People in the audience at the screening I attended were flinching and gasping as if they were being punched in the face. Which, of course, is the idea. If a fight scene doesn't make you feel like you're part of it, so that it quickens your heartbeat and your breathing, then it's a failure. And Cronenberg's makes you realize how many movie fights are flops -- and how really hard it is to kill or immobilize a human being with your arms, legs, feet and hands. Literally and figuratively, \"Eastern Promises\" has guts. And in this sense, it reminds me of both the excruciatingly protracted struggle between Paul Newman and the Russian agent in \"Torn Curtain,\" and the knock-down, drag-out fist-fest between Keith David and Rowdy Roddy Piper in John Carpenter's \"They Live! Directed in a bold, graphic style similar to that of his previous film, \"A History of Violence,\" \"Eastern Promises\" is shockingly gorgeous, for all the ugliness it portrays. The film is set in London, and the colors are dark and heavy: gray skies, slick black streets, brandy, absinthe, venous blood. A hospital midwife (Naomi Watts) finds a patient's diary that gets her involved with Russian gangsters -- in particular, a shrewd and ambitious chauffeur played by \"History of Violence\" star Viggo Mortensen. It begins like a Cronenbergian horror movie, and becomes... a Cronenberg gangster movie -- an elemental struggle between good and evil, life and death, east and west, blood and money, trust and betrayal, commerce and morality, mind and body. Remember, that's \"elemental,\" not \"simplistic.\" There are... complications."

      "text": "If there is one thing Cronenburg is so good at, its taking a movie beyond the limits of being just a movie. It is more a study of the human being, and their behaviors and nature, and how they act and who they are, and who they pretend to be. This movie takes you into the lives of the Russian mob, a very dark, disturbing place to be, and a family of a young woman (played by Naomi Watts), her uncle and aunt find themselves thrown into the chaos. They discover a diary of a young prostitute, and this diary has a lot of power in this movie. Muehller-Stahl, who plays the leader of the vory V Zakone brotherhood, is absolutely terrific, and can shoot one glance that could freeze you, and then cut you to pieces. He is menacing, not in his actions, but in his look alone. Also, Viggo Mortensen delivers the performance of his life, playing this mysterious, off-put, odd friend of the son of the brotherhood leader. He can exude both evil, and kindness in just a few different shots. The action in the movie is real, and it is haunting, and one scene in particular will most likely stick with you in your head for quite some time. This is a movie to be taken seriously, and deep, deep under its seemingly simple layers of story, lies a very interesting tale that leads through the cobwebs of the Russian mob, and just what happens when family is messed with. This is a very good piece on humanity, and it is something not to be missed at a time when all Hollywood can chock up are lame Dane Cook films and same-old same-old \"kill the zombie\" movies."

The directing was good and there was never a dull camera angle. Overall this is my favorite mob/gangster movie. It definitely beats out goodfellas, casino, and the godfather. pick it up and watch it if you havent, but dont if you cant handle the violence and nudity"

It's a great entertainment with a number of interesting ideas bubbling underneath the surface. It's look at the strange world of the Russian mafia is fascinating and the deceptively simple narrative builds to a surprising final half hour. Climaxing with a brilliantly staged fight scene set in a public bath house. Mortensen is terrific and is deserving of some awards recognition. The well chosen supporting cast is perfect. 'Eastern Promises' is minor Cronenberg in the end-but that's still better than 95% of the stuff Hollywood churns out these days. Highly recommended-but not for the squeamish. It is D Cron after all."

For someone who grew up watching the cartoon, the movie was a dream come true, and I also believe Michael Bay(the director) put a lot of us to shame by delivering a worthy product ... but I digress. My intention is to share thoughts on movies I love like the one I just saw, and ones I truly loathe and would gladly request for $9 back...case in point - \"The Reaping\" \"Eastern Promises\" is movie directed by David Cronenberg. You may remember him from \"A History of Violence\". Every one remembers that movie...Seeing Maria Bello in her cheer leader outfit alone was worth the price of admission... then there was the sex scene on the steps. I suggest you rent or purchase it immediately. Back to \"Eastern Promises\"...The main actors are Viggo Mortensen, Naomi Watts, Vincent Cassel and Armin Mueller-Stahl; I'll get to information about their performances soon enough. Without giving much away, the story is basically about a nurse who unfortunately witnesses a 14 year old Russian girl giving birth and dying during labor. She embarks on a quest to find out more about the girl's family and also have her diary translated. On the nurse's quest of discovery, she ends up getting involved with some really vile people, mainly the Russian crime family - Vory V Zakone. The rest of the movie unravels the mystery behind the dead girl, and eventually the father of the baby.Warning! If you are not a fan of violent movies, you will not enjoy this movie. There's enough extreme violence to make the toughest guy squirm. One scene in the steam room is particularly disturbing to watch. I was impressed by all the actors. Naomi Watts, who I last saw playing the love interest of a mega-sized gorilla, put on quite a performance. Her character is the nurse who drove the story, but this is not a role she'll be remembered for...Armin Mueller-Stahl plays the owner of a restaurant and is also affiliated with the Vory V Zakone. Vincent Cassel plays his crazy son Kirill, who much to his father's chagrin, is also rumored to be gay. The true star of the movie is Viggo, who plays Nikolai, a mysterious driver who definitely wants to move up in the family. His russian is fluent, and his accent is perfect. It's almost hard to imagine him speaking in another accent after this movie. He accent and grammar really did sound like his spoke a Slavic language natively. It was very interesting to watch him play his role so flawlessly. In all, this was a pretty good movie. I believe David Cronenberg and Viggo should make more movies together. They certainly have a formula that works."

I have a hard time believing it was meant to be anything more. Cronenberg loves to display violence and gore. He is not attempting to do anything more than entertain through violence.

You must really be simple minded-- There is nothing clever or artistic about this film and I can give you 5 reasons why this is movie is quite possibly the worst movi9e I have seen in a really long time: 5)- It isn't believable-- No one walks into a L&D ward and walks out with a baby, No one is allowed things like a diary aka record of events in that girls situation, by the way how did she escape?? Why bother trying to explain that? 4) It is filled with lame cliches about Russia-- The only 2 Russian cliches they forgot was Dolph Lundgren and Boris and Natasia from Rocky And Bullwinkle 3) It is filled with Homosexual inuendos-- Naked men fighting and dudes watching each other bone-- ri-frickin-diculous 2) it would be pointlessly disturbing at times if it wasn't so hilarious-- verbally- characters say randomly racist things and there is random gory parts that would be borderline gross but ends up looking silly- Like Leprechaun 2 Gore- so unbelievable it is funny but not in a good way. and the #1 reason is.

Instead we get a comic book, like Cronenberg's last film, A History of Violence. The entire film is premised on the ridiculous notion of the Watts character actually going to a location mentioned in the diary of a young girl who died under very unusual circumstances, and then mentioning the diary--when she has people in her OWN FAMILY who are Russian and could translate it!
