During a rescue mission in outer space, Jean is nearly killed when she's hit by a mysterious cosmic force.

      "text": "To be honest, it was clear that Dark Phoenix would be another failure from Marvel, just because the main role playing by Sophie Turner instead of a good actress, or to tell more precisely that Sophie Turner unsuccessfully tried to show something and no one knows what is it. Unfortunately, bosses of film companies and TV channels idiots (mostly) and absolutely don't understand what a quality product means, they have the task to get as much profit as possible, and for it, they think that them need to invite famous faces, but not good professional actors. So here it turns out not a movie, but sh*t with dubious special effects.With regard to Dark Phoenix:- The main  minus is Sophie Turner. How could she be invited after the Game of Thrones and X-Men: Apocalypse ? With the same success, the role of Jean Gray could be played by mannequin from clothes store no one would know the difference.P.S. The New Mutants will be epic fail, for the same reasons as the failure of Dark Phoenix and X-Men: Apocalypse - famous faces not good professional actors. This is especially true of Maisie Williams, which \"actress\" as Sophie Turner.Bob Iger, Christine McCarthy, Alan F. Horn, Alan Bergman, Emma Watts, Cathleen Taff, Asad Ayaz, Isaac Perlmutter, Dan Buckley, Joe Quesada, Kevin Feige, Louis D'Esposito, Victoria Alonso what are you f* doing?"

      "text": "First of all, I hated everything in this movie and really found no joy in this movie. As soon as I saw the credits rolling I booked it out of the theatre and was the first one out. This movie is so slow in its pacing to the point I nearly fell asleep a bunch of times. This is a superhero movie and part of one of the greatest Marvel superhero teams and there is nothing to keep somebody\u2019s attention for longer than 2 seconds. This movie is one-hour and fifty-four-minutes long but it feels like a three-hour-long film. This is due to the boring dialogue and a slow-paced story that never really picked up at any point. Even the action scenes were boring to watch. This movie has one of the most iconic comic book person ever and they just waste her. There is like three or four action scenes in this film and every single one was just as boring as the last one. The characters for some reason changed so that they were nothing like what they were actually supposed to be. This can be mainly seen with Charles, played by McAvoy, and Nightcrawler, played by Kodi Smit-McPhee. They both had major character changes that just didn\u2019t suit their characters at all. Also, I rewatched a clip from X-Men Apocalypse and Nightcrawler had a downgrade on his makeup effects. The makeup looks nothing like what it did in the last movie. The special effects in this film were just hideous and I couldn\u2019t stand to look at it. This film had a budget of $200 million dollars and I think all of it went to get back all of the actors because they all probably had better movies to film. Lots of scenes in this film just ended randomly. The part where I thought the film was going to end ended up not being the ending and went on for like 2 more pointless minutes. In the end, Dark Phoenix just isn\u2019t a good film for anybody. I give Dark Phoenix a 3.5/10."

      "text": "X-Men: Dark Phoenix, an end to an eraThe Stream: The movie is a bit predictable, lacks originality and the end leaves you a little empty.The Big Screen: The movie looks great on the big screen particularly in action sequences.The Final Bill: Being the end of an era, X-Men fans should catch it in the theaters and general watchers should watch the other movies first and then consider a matinee, if you have free time.No after credit scene. Parents be warned that unlike the other 3 movies PG-13 is accurate with some language and violence towards the end.-S2SStream to Big Screen is back at it again. This week we will be reviewing the long awaited, X-Men: Dark Phoenix. The fourth, and final, movie of this recent X-Men reboot. A movie marking a last for 21st Century Fox films with the X-Men due to the Disney/Marvel acquisition. The third movie of the series had mixed reviews but ultimately was very entertaining. Let\u2019s see if Dark Phoenix arose from the ashes for one last flight.Let\u2019s dive deep into the ashes. I wouldn\u2019t say that there are elements of this movie that are bad, just ones that were lacking. The movie is missing some minor detail that would lead you to say, \u201cOh, that right there was on point.\u201d Even in the ending, the viewer just feels like the movie was good, but something was missing. I\u2019m not sure what 21st Century Fox and director, Simon Kinberg, were thinking when they looked at the product as a whole. Looking back on it, the movie made you feel like when you pick up your cup expecting orange juice, but actually you picked up the wrong cup and drank apple juice. It\u2019s still healthy for you and it quenched your thirst to a degree, but it wasn\u2019t the taste you expected.On top of that, this movie is too eerily similar to X-Men: The Last Stand. Too many elements of the movie made me feel as if I was watching a reboot of Last Stand rather than it\u2019s own independent movie. No seriously, the plot was similar, except the stupid cure aspect. With that said, Dark Phoenix is actually a better version of Last Stand. This may be the reason why the movie feels like it\u2019s lacking originality, but ultimately the movie is just too predictable on its own. This may also be because of the movie trailer. The movie trailer was very good, but also gives away too much. The movie did hide a couple secrets from the viewers, which were worth it, but again execution was lacking. Finally, the director let the movie live in flashbacks too much. An issue not too horrible, but we got the point of the flashbacks the first time we saw them. The 5th time was understood, but just too much.Now, the part that you\u2019ve been waiting for. This movie looks like they spent a $200 million budget. The scenes seem to literally jump off the screen at times. The scene that was in space look great and the action scenes are very clear and well cgi-ed, except for some running and flying. Unlike the previous installments, the movie\u2019s action towards the end is closer to a John Wick film than X-Men. Quite welcomed, even though it\u2019s short lived.The storyline, while predictable, still was executed well, except the ending of the franchise. We take a ride with the X-Men every step of the way. Just like the movie jumps off the screen, so do the emotions we feel. Sansa, while not a great actress, displays a nice depiction of a person drinking in /falling prey to power, yet keeping true to who we\u2019ve known her character to be. James McAvoy, again does a good job, but the movie missed an opportunity to truly use Michael Fassbender. Clearly, the producers were featuring the Queen of the North, but they could have still taken advantage of the star talent in the cast. Lastly, the movie has a little comedy in it, compared to the previous installments, but the few chuckles were good.Long story short, X-Men: Dark Phoenix is a solid movie, but is just lacking a little in execution that would make you say it was a great movie. For fans of the series, you should see this through to the end and the action scenes will make it worth a matinee price. For everyone else, go check out the previous installments first, and then consider seeing the movie during an early matinee."

Some superb acting here and Simon Kinberg's pleasing direction means all the production goodness is up on the screen here. The emotional and action packed core of the film is present and solid with Sophie Turner delivering an excellent performance here as troubled mutant Jean Grey. The teenage me that grew up loving the animated xmen series was so happy watching this today!(was genuinely moved by the ending also!) So for all true x-fans who love seeing the trials and tribulations of those poor downtrodden uncanny mutants, ignore the hate and breathe in the x-goodness that is Dark Phoenix."

Character motivations are slim or nonexistent and the cast seems entirely checked out. Overall, I cannot recommend strongly enough that you go see something else.
