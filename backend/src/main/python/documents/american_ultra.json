Jesse Eisneberg is an actor that continues to impress me, film after film, he is funny and energetic in a over the top, insane film.

B"}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Take a bit of a James Bond movie, another part from Cheech & Chong, and mix it up with elements of the recent film 'Spy' and out comes the new movie 'American Ultra.'\r 'American Ultra' is a spy action thriller movie masquerading as a stoner film (have a look at the film poster and you'll see) with lots and lots of comedy. And once it's over you think the person who wrote the film (Max Landis) must've been high on something when he wrote it. Mike (Jesse Eisenberg - The Social Network) and Phoebe (Kristen Stewart) are, basically, potheads, living in what seems like a very empty town in West Virginia. They've been together for several years, with Mike never getting the courage to ask her to marry him. He's booked a trip to take her to Hawaii to propose but he's afraid of flying so they never actually get on the plane. But Mike's content with his job as a cashier at the local Cash & Carry, where there never seems to be any customers. But he's not the person you think he is. He's actually a sleeper agent, a machine, created by the CIA, and they want him terminated - NOW. So one day in his store walks in CIA agent Victoria Lasseter (Connie Britton). She's come to town to rescue him - Mike was an experiment she created - a machine with superpowers - so she feels the need to play mother and protect her offspring. Mike has no idea who she is - but she's able to activate him - turning on his superpowers so that he can protect himself. But CIA supervisor Adrian Yates (Topher Grace) wants him destroyed - at all costs. Even if it means killing Agent Lasseter in the process. So he sets up a command post in Mike's town to look for him and to have him killed, bringing in tow with him soldiers who used to be mental patients. So in between all this we get explosions, lots of gunfire, and a visit to the home of Mike and Kirsten's pot dealer (John Leguizamo) where they go to hide. It all leads up to an extremely bloody conclusion in the town's discount superstore (a la Walmart).\r As mentioned earlier, 'American Ultra's' script is so far out there that one wonders where Landis (son of director John Landis) got his idea for the film. And Director Nima Nourizadeh (whose only other directing credit is 2012's 'Project X' where three high school seniors host a party that spirals out of control) keeps the action flowing, which takes place over the course of one night, but he can't help but let the silliness of the plot take over. Mike and Kirsten seem to be the most sensible people in the film, whereby the CIA agents are badly drawn as buffoon carton characters who can't pull off their mission. 'American Ultra' reminds me a bit of 'This is the End' - Seth Rogen and James Franco's 2013 comedy about the end of the world - where it just keeps on getting funnier and more surrealistic. 'American Ultra,' even though it looks slick, seems to be missing the ingredients that made 'This is the End' memorable. And while it's a good ride that may make you high from just watching it, it's also very silly to be taken as a true comedy. 'American Ultra' is not as good as a Bond film, but, in it's favor, it's not as bad as 'Spy.'\r 'American Ultra' is now out in theatres."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "This movie isn't as bad as people make it seem. I went in just knowing that its about a stoner who's really a spy (of sorts) and that's all.

To me that is not a problem in the film, that is a problem in the management of expectations. Maybe it was because of the trailer (which I hadn't seen), but that's mostly a problem of the marketing department of the production studio. Either ways not a fault with the movie.

You expect Stewart to just play the straight man to the anxious Eisenberg, but this movie is more of a romance than anything. Rather than focus on the action that everyone wants the story is relying on a fine romance but is really unnecessary in this type or film.\r Another disappointment I had with this film was the lack of fun. It does not have the tone that you expect and it really doesn\u2019t have the flare that attracts your eye and makes you want to watch the film. The action that are waiting for finally comes in the final act but its not quite fulfilling after waiting so long for it to arrive. I also believe that most people are going taren\u2019t going to be able to make connections with this movie. It seems like you have to be a stoner in order to find the humour in this movie. I will say that the only character I found the slightest bit funny was the villain played by Topher Grace. Grace was kind of funny but he still wasn\u2019t a good villain, his motives are a little unclear as well.

Similar to Pineapple Express, the film derives its comedy from placing slow (both in speech and brains) stoners in improbable situations with guns. In fairness, this is a terrific formula for an action comedy. Starring Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart, American Ultra is the definition of easy watching. It is solidly funny, solidly action-packed, and great for watching on demand. If you pay to watch this film, the joke is really on you.Comedy-wise, American Ultra largely relies upon the hilarious nature of its premise, as well as its protagonists. Thanks to the good acting from Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart, this largely works out quite well as the deliver the lines with the right speed and level of curiosity to really drive home the subtly comedy. In many ways, the film mirrors the experience of being around a friend while they are stoned. Initially, it may be thoroughly hysterical. After a while, it does grow grating. Fortunately, American Ultra recognizes this and is mercifully only 90 minutes, which largely prevents it from overstaying its welcome. That said, it does not provoke that many laughs. For a film about a stoner sleeper agent, the film really is quite reserved and does not go for the gold too often. Instead, it is fine with producing decent chuckles along the way, instead of fully committing to the sheer lunacy of its premise.Where the comedy slacks, the chemistry between Eisenberg and Stewart really shines. First demonstrated in Adventureland, this odd couple duo really work well with one another. American Ultra is no exception as the film is quickly able to develop their romance and relationship with incredible believability. While everything else in the film is ludicrous and over-the-top, the film really manages to craft a solid romance along the way in which their devotion to one another becomes incredibly evident.In terms of its action, American Ultra certainly delivers the good. With stylish action akin to a Tarantino flick, but with the sped up action moments that, for whatever reason, reminded me of Zombieland due to its casual, yet stylish nature, the film is entertaining. Heavy on blood effects and inventive kills (a man is killed by a spoon...), American Ultra has a ton of fun with its characters and situation. The end result is a largely infectious feeling, instilled by these action sequences. Even better, it never takes itself too seriously and solely seeks to entertain. While the world is crumbling around them, Eisenberg's Mike Howell and Stewart's Phoebe Larson freak out alongside it, but match it with killer instincts when it comes time to fight for their lives. Thus, while quite bloody, the action scenes are intense and worthwhile.All of this said, American Ultra is never a good film. It is the very definition of a Redbox rental. It is a film you grab because you are too lazy to really try and find something else to watch. However, it is also not a bad film. With solid comedy and good action sequences, as well as typically good performances, there is more going on in American Ultra than meets the eye. Plus, who does not appreciate John Leguizamo hamming it up as a West Virginia gangster? While not the most challenging film ever made, this one is a solidly put together action comedy that under-utilizes its talented cast, but is fun while it lasts."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "After I first saw the trailer for American Ultra I became very excited for the film.

The rest of the characters were forgettable.\r Overall I think I had more fun watching the trailer than the actual movie."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Imagine if Rambo or Bourne or any of the uber-killer ego-stroking fantasy roles had been performed by someone with the stage presence of a Woody Allen and you'll be close to understanding the off-beat appeal of American Ultra.The plot is basically a conspiracy theory come true.  If you believe that kind of stuff then there's a lot of deep dark secrets revealed by this film.  If you know crazy when you see it then this film is a whole bunch of fun.  Of course, if you harbor secret fantasies about being someone like Wick et al then there's nothing much left to say.  But if you can appreciate a tale about a geeky stoner sort of dude thrust into the extraordinary without even recognizing his own surreal abilities, then this is the film for you.It\u2019s quirky, funny at times, full of action sequences that sometimes boggle the mind, and in the end it gives you a mild surprise that we all should have seen coming.If you don\u2019t like American Ultra then you have no sense of humor and you take yourself far too seriously."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Really boring movie in my opinion. Had a really good premise, was really excited after seeing the trailer, but the actual movie was quite cliche basically and nothing impressive happened. The beginning was really boring (first 10 minutes), but then, when the main character got ''activated'' it seemed like the action will start to happen - while it kinda did, it was so predictable and boring. As I rate movies by their plots it really did felt like waste of time, even though acting was ok (even for Kristen Stewart) and I consider it not that good of a movie if you can shortly retell it in a few sentences."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "It was at the very least a fun movie! It felt over the top in parts with just enough ridiculousness for me. It was rather predictable in parts, but i still managed to enjoy the \"twists\""}, {"rating": "4", "text": "This movie has so many surprisingly good elements that I don't want to give it a bad review. The acting's charming, and the romantic parts are generally sweet and believable. But if you're looking for a fun action movie, don't bother- most of the action is in the trailer, and it's not always well paced in the movie itself (the same goes for at least half the humor, IMO). The people who made this movie also don't seem to be sure whether they're making a Bourne Ultimatum-style \"having a bunch of  brainwashed assassins is totally crazy and wrong\" statement, or if they're in more of a \"let's kill bad guys in fun and splashy ways\" mindset, which is also pretty annoying considering the ending."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "A good movie . Un poco de humor, cargado de adrenalina. Esto es realmente fantastico. Las actuaciones de sus protagonistas, magistrales. Muy bien por la productora y el director."}], "recommendations": ["the_losers", "keeping_up_with_the_joneses", "rocknrolla", "hancock", "snatch", "thor_the_dark_world", "ant_man_and_the_wasp_quantumania", "kingsman_the_golden_circle", "kingsman_the_secret_service", "copshop", "hercules", "the_a_team", "the_bank_job", "deadpool", "the_family", "lucky_number_slevin", "logan_lucky", "nobody", "deadpool_2", "seven_psychopaths", "the_nice_guys", "the_wolf_of_snow_hollow", "ready_or_not", "boss_level", "shazam_fury_of_the_gods"]}
