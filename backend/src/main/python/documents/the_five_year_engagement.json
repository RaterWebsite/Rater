      "text": "Sounds and music effects created this childish atmosphere in complete contrast to the story of two adults, having decision-relationship-life problems. That's a characteristic in dramedies, but because the line is to\u043e thin, most of them fail to be either funny or exciting/interesting. Plus characters were unlikable and annoying. The film could be at least bearable, if it doesn't last so long."

      "text": "There's no doubting that this 'Engagement' is well-over-due, standing in at about 124 minutes, it tries arduously to remain funny, smart, and slickly-written, but not even its cohesively-paired leads can keep it afloat of the persistent rawness that just won't let it go. Drowning and ultimately running out of gas from its incessant unevenness, and pacing, 'Engagment' is a few edits away from being several notches above the average rom-com, however, as is, neither the supporting characters' development, nor the much-needed tightening of its improvised sequences are made apparent. Although Blunt (Violet Barnes) and Seigel's (Tom Solomon) performances will be more than enough to pacify casual followers of the genre--even despite the impressive degree of realism derived from two and the central premise--it's simply not funny enough to rationalize its overlong trip of meandering. And, while Blunt and Seigel, together, make a great team, they very quickly, lose empathy from audiences, who after, say, 80 minutes, are no longer interested in watching them anymore, or even concerned with what happens next; this too, especially for the casual moviegoer--the intended audience--becomes more of an exercise in patience than an outing of pleasure. In short, 'Engagement' isn't short enough."

Many of the supporting actors were quite good as well.  Sadly, the film wastes their considerable talent.  The film is just too full of raunch with no good explanation why.   Too few truly funny scenes and way too many ugly, raunchy, awkward scenes which added nothing to a good story idea, only made the movie too long."

It's not the most original story, but I love the way the writers and directors really put out for laughs.  They dwell on the funny and the pervers, and it pays off.  The lead actors are solid, but the variety and skill of the very broad supporting cast truly made the film. So yes, I definitely recommend the film - just don't expect Wedding Crashers, Old School, or even Forgetting Sarah Marshall.   Just go in ready to laugh at some off-center humor."

      "text": "Jason Segel's films all suffer from the same two problems:  editing and raunch.  It keeps his movies from being classic chick flick comedies and relegates them to the status of mild chucklers soon forgotten.  The funny gets lost in a sea of pointless footage.  Since women are a primary audience for films like this, I think it's better to err on the side of less raunchy humor. No woman ever left a movie yet saying, \"I wish there had been more raunchy humor.\" Watch Love, Actually to get the feel of how to do this.  It may just be the difference between what constitutes raunchy to a male producer... and if so, maybe hire woman editors."

Its one of those films you become very attached to, and you actually feel what the characters are feeling. I thoroughly enjoyed this film. The only issue i found with it is it was overly long. It dragged on at different points throughout but overall it was a good film. I'm actually a pretty big Jason Segel fan, hes a very good actor, and also a veryy good writer as well. I am also a big Emily Blunt fan too so it was definitely a great cast in my opinion, all in all this film was great and it will leave you with a smile on your face, not to spoil anything, but everybody knows how these films end. Great writing, great cast, laugh out loud comedy, drags a bit through the middle and leading towards the end but overally this is a good film. 7/10"

Unfortunately, the secondary characters were either over shadowed or were not up to par either comically or emotionally. Not believable. I was surprised by the amount I enjoyed this picture as am not a major fan of Apatow. As a rule I try to stay away from anything he has his hands in. Overall, funny, romcom that dudes can like."

This is a mediocre chick-flick that tries to spice things up with lots of dick jokes and four-letter words. It is mildly amusing, but nothing about the dialogue, situations or performances elevates into any memorable category."

But I'm not a marriage person and I would have preferred a little less Anglophilia (even though Emily Blunt is the star).  But I can see how lots of people would think this was 'super cute'.  And it was, until suddenly it wasn't anymore (about an hour in). Good looking people, commonly quirky situations, and very generic/middle brow wit.  If you are part of a couple contemplating the 'big plunge', put this on your cue.  If you're a confirmed bachelor/bachelorette, or not in a couple..it can wait.\rETA;I'm going through an Anti Social-Programming phase and THIS film absolutely warns of the dangers of not conforming to social expectations.  If you're okay with cute little lessons in 'how to be normal' but still acceptably quirky, then this is definitely for you.  If you don't care to walk the same path as every other person who every pretended to be happy and don't need another example of how to do it, avoid this.  It's just the same couple you've seen a million times."

This film is dragged out far too long and there's really very little to be excited about, or laugh at. The jokes are few and far between and around the one hour mark I just wanted it to be over. Cut about 40 minutes out and it could be a lot more solid."

It's true this movie can be very funny at times, but ultimately I feel that it falls short of being, what I would call, a good movie. Instead it manages to be a decent experience with some hilarious moments. What made the movie fall short for me was the two lead characters. I just didn't care about them or their relationship that much at all. Combine this with the fact that 99% of the humorous moments come strictly from the excellent supporting cast (Kevin Hart!) and it's not hard to lose interest in the main characters. Honestly I wished the movie focused more on the supporting cast. In the end it's an ok movie, and there are some touching romantic moments, but for me the whole movie just kind of fell short."

About halfway through the film, I was wondering if the painful drag out to 2 hours was ever going to end. I mean, if this was supposed to be a romantic comedy, it suddenly became a headache-inducing bore-fest. There were so many scenes that could have been removed and many of the characters apart from the main ones became incredibly pointless. If it wasn't for my sister, I would have dived out of the cinema the second I realised I was wasting my time."

      "text": "The Five-Year Engagement is definitely unique, that's for sure. It's a romantic comedy that's not really all that romantic or funny. It's not really entertaining at all but it is well made with solid acting and a great cast. While it doesn't have much in the way of entertainment value, there's something very pure and real about the story being told that I think anyone could relate to. It almost felt like a modern-day satyr play in cinema form with the way the tragedies of life were very subtle and almost brushed aside but yet still powerful regarding the plot development. And while this certainly wasn't my favorite Jason Segel movie, it's still worth watching; It just wasn't really what I expected. Emily Blunt is stunning as usual. How she doesn't get more mainstream recognition for her beauty, acting ability, and versatility is beyond me. Also, the minor cast members and cameos really stood out and almost stole the show. Chris Pratt and Alison Brie were absolutely hilarious as were, well, just about everybody else. Honestly, Segel and Blunt might have been the least funny characters in the film. I think that's part of why they stood out so much though as relatable protagonists."

Instead of feeling engaged in the movie you feel put off by it and it makes getting engaged seem like a drag.
