In setting up his \"club,\" his homophobia is challenged when he partners with a trans character (Jared Leto). The story unfolds at a steady pace, but it's really about the two leads. McConaughey imbues his character with much of the swagger typical of his personality, but manages to show emotion once or twice. It's Leto who completely transforms himself into a sweet, sensitive woman and creates the film's most poignant peaks. The movie is a bit too long and repetitive in the setbacks, but it still manages to tell the story effectively with award-potential performances."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Dallas Buyers Club is a well developed movie because it shows deeply the human aspect when it is facing enormous adversities, which resemble the Greek tragedy, that in this case treats of a man against HIV and the American FDA. The main character portrayed us all in common life, fighting for what we deserve, getting up after several falls, but there is always someone or something that wants to take you down for money reasons. Beneath this primary message we can discover one about acceptance and changing ones minds, add to this the film transmit the idea of being who you wish; here is the character of Raynon who takes care of these. Despite that these topics seem very unoriginal, is the way in which is shown that makes the difference, turning the environment very visceral. First we have the protagonist: who is very well accompanied by a travesty that doesn't fear of saying what he thinks and a doctor that questions everything that is imposed. Of course they all are amazingly performed, highlighting Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto. Another interesting thing is how this movie manages music and sound in order to represent in a better way the life of these sick people. Obviously it is accomplish by a strong direction and script."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "McConaughey is almost unrecognisable, the story's moving but only if you think that it's happened for real. Also, maybe the depiction of AIDS patients is a little too blunt for what was this condition really was in 1985. The homophobia looks a bit pushed, but it is Texas, so I wouldn't know if that would correspond to reality.\r Great acting performances - the only problem is this plot has been a little overused before, even if again, it is a real story, and therefore lacking the rocambolesque bit to it. If you are willing to forget that this film is not like others, and wants (for once) to be a close-to-reality account, and hence you are willing to not expect to be overflown with pity and compassion at all times, then it's probably at least a 9 for you."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "I never thought I'd say this, but Matthew McConaughey actually has talent! This film was the one that finally proved that to me! In this film, he portrays Ron Woodruff, a bull rider and electrician who tests positively for HIV. The film is loosely based on the true story of his buyers club that he starts for several other HIV patients with the use of illegal drugs. The film boasts a solid and talented cast. McConaughey gives what is, in my opinion, his best performance yet by far! Jennifer Garner also gives an honest performance as a headstrong doctor. Jared Leto returns to the big screen after his four-year absence from filmmaking as a transvestite named Rayon. His performance, along with McConaughey's is what really propels the film's conflict. Overall, the pacing is slow in some spots, but manages all the while to remain entertaining, thanks to the Oscarworthy performances from McConaughey and Leto. Definitely check this one out for an interesting take on a great true story!"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This is the movie you see about a week or two after seeing \"How to Survive a Plague\", which comprehensively details the political/movement details underpinning this excellent story. McConaughey is outstanding, but I want to make sure and mention that Jennifer Garner is fantastic in a supporting role. She is so much better in subtle, compassionate roles, as opposed to the caricature stuff she often plays, such as her role in \"Butter.\"   I  also hope that Jared Leto is recognized for such a daring portrayal. Even though the topic is extraordinarily emotional and heavy, the movie is not difficult to endure. It's a hopeful tale  one that I recommend."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I thought Dallas Buyers Club would be underrated but this film is surprisingly successful.There's nothing that i didn't like about that movie, it's perfect.Matthew McConaughey is incredible as Ron Woodroof, a homophobic cowboy diagnosed with HIV and given 30 days to live.

They're both brilliant in showcasing two faces of AIDS sufferers which oppose each other; one being a fighter doing all they can to prolong their life and the other succumbing to their disease by giving in and not taking their treatment seriously. What's beautiful is the characters themselves are polar opposites and this disease brings them together which results in helping many people.\r Unlike Philadelphia which gave us a personal story which shows us a complete journey of an AIDS sufferer til death, this film instead chooses to highlight how different people react to a disease differently. It also highlights how much of a joke the US health system is, particularly in how they addressed AIDS - other countries were putting out drugs which were effective and easier to access; whereas the US would put a harmful product out as a reaction to public need without proper analysis whilst also limiting access. When the film ended I wanted to see more of Ron Woodruff's story or at least a photo of what he looked like.\r It's a must see film that will surprisingly make you laugh too."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Despite all the effort and talent on display, DALLAS BUYER'S CLUB is surprisingly ineffectual.

The issue comes in when the public believes this movie was real. or the public begins to \"relate\" to it and react because of it. Now, on some levels it was a good scary live right movie or you will die. Good stuff; BUT, now it had almost nothing to do with the real AIDS campaign. Sure, they made sure to drop a few key words to wet ones appetite, BUT, it still sent the following false messages: a.) Some big things aren't about money. b.) Everything IS about money. c.) Aids was a big deal in places other than San Francisco. d.) People can have heart attacks and walk out of a hospital 30 minutes later just fine, (if your matt m. famous movie actor). 4.) An average person can treat legal, law enforcement, and medical folks violently and not be put in jail, or brought up on charges. If I shot a shotgun at a door anywhere, there would be cops there in 3 minutes.  So, what now? On to the good stuff. The acting was marginal and seemed fake and felt like they were reading the script in rehearsal. Am I jealous of what these actors get paid to do this stuff? Your dam right I am.

Though the field is very competitive this year in the best actor category he certainly deserves an Oscar nomination and, possibly, a win.\r McConaughney plays Ron Woodruff, the true story of a womanizing, dope taking electrician cowboy who was diagnosed with AIDS in 1985 and given 30 days to live. After a few rough days he accepts the diagnosis but does not accept the 30 day sentence. He takes AZT through underground channels as it is not approved by the FDA and is only available in a patient experiment. He quickly finds out how toxic it is, killing most people who are taking it, and does research finding other drugs, though illegal in the USA, are available in Mexico. Being a hustler he starts a club which costs $400 to join and gives people the drugs for free.\r As most people thought at that time, his friends, and the men he worked with, thought of AIDS as a 'gay disease' and quickly finds himself in fights and being ostracized. Collapsing one day he is rushed to the hospital where he shares a room with Rayon (Jared Leto) a transsexual with AIDS and enough sass to beat, and take his money, in a game of cards with Ron. When the latter starts his club and needs customers he and Rayon become partners developing a constant bickering repartee that also brings great empathy to both. There is no looking away from Jared Leto's performance, especially a scene when he visits his father, who brings across the sass he uses as a defense and the hurt he finds as a transsexual. At this point there is no reason he shouldn't get an Oscar nomination and if he wins it will be deserved just as McConaughey will have earned his.\r The films shows all the problems that people with AIDS faced, not only the discrimination but with the FDA and medical profession working against them. Ron travels all over the world to get the needed drugs and he is faced with all sorts of problems from the government and the Boards of hospitals. He eventually goes to court in San Francisco to fight for his right to take drugs that aren't approved in the USA for, mainly, financial reasons.\r Ron gets involved with a doctor, Eve Saks, played by Jennifer Garner who does a great job but really isn't necessary to/for the movie. Denis O'Hare as her boss Dr. Sevard, Griffin Dunne as an American doctor working in Mexico along with all the supporting actors give excellent support.\r The director, Jean-Marc Vallee, and the screenwriters Craig Borton and Melissa Wallack, in telling the story of two polar opposite men, don't hesitate in telling, and showing, how the world of AIDS was in the 1980s.\r Both Matthew McConaughhey and Jared Leto give full portraits of two completely different people who come together to help each other to live and wind up respecting each others role in life.\r \"Dallas Players Club\" is a must see film not only for the two main performances but for the history of the beginning of an illness that was discriminated against by the government, medical profession and the public and is still killing people today!"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "One of the best movies of the year. Oscar nominations for Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto. The movie documents a sad chapter in the history of our country and how many lives were lost because of the FDA and President Regan."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Though it may be a story of sickness and death, \"Dallas Buyers Club\" is about the rebirth of a homophobe. Suddenly an outcast among his heterosexual friends, Woodroof reluctantly warms to a new community  particularly a drug-addicted transsexual named Rayon who becomes his business partner. Rayon is played by an earnestly committed Jared Leto who nevertheless comes off as a theatrical drag queen cliche. They run the buyers club together out of a cheap motel, the unlikeliest pair of Bonnie and Clyde renegades yet. Quebec filmmaker Jean-Marc Vallee (\"The Young Victoria\") directs \"Dallas Buyers Club\" with a loose naturalism, seedy environs and lively humour that prevents the film from becoming over-sentimentalized. It's a true story long in the making (screenplay by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack) based on Woodroof's remarkable late life. But what \"Dallas Buyers Club\" is, ultimately, is the apotheosis of another transformation: McConaughey's great U-turn. A few years after sinking into rote romantic comedies, \"Dallas Buyers Club\" tops an astonishing streak for the 43-year-old that has included \"Mud,\"  Bernie\". He lost more than 40 pounds for the role (Leto, too, is startlingly thin), and appears so gaunt as to wipe away any memory of his rosier, more superficial performances. Extreme weight loss, too, can be a superficial ploy, but McConaughey inhabits the clamouring, clawing Woodroof, whose zest for life (which McConaughey has always exuded) flourishes with the meaning of a moral cause. He stomps down hospital hallways in cowboy boots, a foul-mouthed champion against the system, spouting obscenities in a Texas drawl. In one late scene that could be either Woodroof or McConaughey, he looks in the mirror, and smiles."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "About as good of performances as you're probably ever going to get from Matthew McConaughey.

Whether in a strong supporting role (e.g. \"Bernie\"), a memorable turn as a key character (\"Mud\") or carrying the whole film as he does here, he's just been riveting and real. Of course his physical transformation is amazing, but I have to note that he's also one of very few actors who can convincingly portray someone who is \"impaired\" (drunk or whatever). As for the rest of the film, it's basically a medically themed docudrama, on the order of \"Lorenzo's Oil.\" It is interesting and worthwhile to recall how screwed up so many things were as people learned gradually about the AIDS crisis.

Its a movie about tolerance, acceptance, and the fact that our FDA is more concerned with profit than helping people recover.

Mcconaughey and Leto make a believer out of me. The script was so good that they simply needed to support it, instead both knocked it out of the park.

The odds are very rosy and clearly he is the front-runner now, the only weighty competitor is his THE WOLF OF WALL STREET (2013) co-star DiCaprio, whose overdue condition may facilitate him to snatch the highest kudos.\r DALLAS BUYERS CLUB is a dark horse in the BEST PICTURE race and altogether it picked up 6 nominations, apart from BEST LEADING ACTOR, Jared Leto is also having BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR trophy in his bag. Both men\u2019s weigh-lost exploits are purely meritorious for the sake of taking \u201cacting\u201d with full-blooded dedication, which usually works every time, say Daniel Day-Lewis in MY LEFT FOOT (1989, 8/10), or Tom Hanks in PHILADELPHIA (1993), right, the film is also about AIDS, but Ron Woodroof (McConaughey) is an out-and-out straight man, a dissolute rodeo actually, who is as parochial as his working-class peers, homophobic, ribald and unlikeable, squandering his life immoderately without repentance.\r So, when HIV resides inside his body, as if the almighty God generously give Ron a chance to redeem his meaningless life, it is a customary one man\u2019s fight against the venal DEA, the monopolized pharmaceutical enterprise and the collusive hospital MDs, but there is a missing point, like many biographical narratives, all the achievement comes rather easily in a way that we audiences never comprehend what makes the protagonist \u201cthe chosen one\u201d, as for Ron, it is his macho heterosexuality distinguishes himself from the massive homosexual patients, thus the clash and metamorphosis is very theatrical, but how does he manage to be the pioneer in the business of illegal medicines deserves more detailed dissection.\r Director Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e (C.R.A.Z.Y. 2005, 8/10) is not a novice in dealing with gay-themed feature, although DALLAS BUYERS CLUB is more of an assigned job for him, a light touch comes effectively when he wields the rodeo clown metaphor to manifest Ron\u2019s inner fear, surreptitious and hallucinating. The make-up team is quite praiseworthy too with so many damaged goods to take care of, the impact is authentically appalling.\r From denial to acceptance, McConaughey unleashes an energetic personification with electrifying panache, self-destructive, uplifting and utter poignant, Ron is not a likable person, but in the end of the day, he becomes a better man, an unorthodox hero. Leto, on the other hand, sets an immaculate epitome of a woman\u2019s soul trapped in a man\u2019s body, his most emotive scene is the only time he wears a baggy man\u2019s suit to ask help from his estranged father, awkward and uncomfortable, his vulnerability is all over the place. Jennifer Garner, as the good side of the hospital doctors, is almost characterless and generic, a major disappointment in the storyline, her patronizing poise is perpetually obtrusive, it is a character should not occupy so much of her screen time, we would love see more of Leto instead.\r It is never a winning battle for Ron, the obstacles are too redoubtable to conquer and Ron doesn\u2019t have the time either, we might wallow in the staged success, but the reality tells us it is a tough one to hem in the lucrative pharmaceutics within a modulated system, the \u201clife first\u201d rule certainly is easier said than done."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "A story centering about a homophobic racist southern roadeo rider who finds out he has aids and his friends turn on him during the aids epidemic in the 80s.

To me, McConaughey was better in Mud, Killer Joe, and (later) True Detective. Leto was better in Requiem for a Dream and Mr. Nobody. However, both were great here and deserved their Oscars, if not just for this film, but for their body of work. Jennifer Garner is also good here, though she somehow managed to fly under the radar for many.

In ospedale gli danno trenta giorni e una medicina che lo fa stare peggio: Ron decide di reagire, va in Messico alla ricerca di una cura alternativa e, quando la trova, mette su un\u2019importazione parallela (nonch\u00e9 illegale) per distribuirla ad altri nelle sue condizioni attraverso il club di cui al titolo, ingegnosa trovata per aggirare il divieto di vendita diretta. Ad aiutarlo c\u2019\u00e8 soprattutto il travestito Rayon, che gli allarga a dismisura la clientela, ma presto arriva il contrasto con la rigidit\u00e0 della medicina ufficiale e con le case farmaceutiche: una battaglia persa, ma, prima di morire ben sette anni dopo rispetto a quando gli era stato pronosticato, Ron riuscir\u00e0 a ottenere, almeno in parte, ragione. E\u2019 curioso che, anche adesso che la malattia \u00e8 stata culturalmente metabolizzata, i film sull\u2019AIDS continuino a essere assai rari: l\u2019argomento sembra restare tab\u00f9 e anche questa sceneggiatura di Craig Borten e Melisa Wallack ha fatto una gran fatica a venire alla luce. Il progetto, nato quando Woodroof era ancora vivo, \u00e8 passato per tante mani ed \u00e8 stato finalmente realizzato solo grazie al contributo di McConaughey e al contenimento dei costi: solo venticinque giorni di riprese (se non altro, i due protagonisti hanno cos\u00ec evitato di morire d\u2019inedia) e attrezzature ridotte al minimo. Con queste ultime, il canadese Vall\u00e9e firma un dramma classico in cui si narra la parabola di redenzione di un uomo ignobile che ha il coraggio di sfidare il destino e i mulini a vento (ovvero Big Pharma), superando al contempo i propri pregiudizi mentre mette in mostra un fino a quel momento sopito spirito imprenditoriale. Come si nota, tutta una serie di classici temi del cinema statunitense che vengono per\u00f2 raccontati con il piede ben piantato sul pedale del freno: i patetismi sono banditi in favore di uno sguardo molto naturalistico (magari un po\u2019 aiutato dalla carenza di mezzi) che sembra ispirarsi a certe opere di Cassavetes. Il Texas che ne esce \u00e8 un postaccio, dove lo squallore degli ambienti si somma alle ristrettezze mentali di chi ci vive senza alcun desiderio di allargare l\u2019orizzonte: solo la malattia arriva a portare un sconvolgimento tale da far cadere le barriere, ma il prezzo \u00e8 venire esclusi senza piet\u00e0 dal proprio ambiente. Proprio per la capacit\u00e0 di narrare tale sconvolgimento, la prima parte del film si rivela pi\u00f9 interessante della seconda, dove hanno il sopravvento le disavventure del protagonista con la DEA e con la giustizia del suo Paese diminuendo in qualche modo l\u2019intensit\u00e0 della pellicola anche se l\u2019impostazione visiva rimane coerente: si veda il tristissimo ristorante in cui Ron cena con la dottoressa Saks (Jennifer Garner), l\u2019unica esponente della medicina \u2018ufficiale\u2019 che si degni di dargli ascolto. E\u2019 probabile che gli dia ascolto anche perch\u00e9, sotto i baffoni e dietro l\u2019aspetto pelle e ossa ottenuto perdendo circa venti chili, c\u2019\u00e8 il fascino di Matthew McConaughey, la cui prova d\u2019attore, con incluso tour de force fisico, \u00e8 il vero valore aggiunto di \u2018Dallas buyers club\u2019 che, grazie a lui, passa da lavoro discreto a pellicola da vedere: l\u2019immedesimazione \u00e8 sia fisica sia psicologica per una recitazione che, come il film, riesce a trasmettere la carica emotiva pur sforzandosi di non mostrarla in modo palese. Accanto a lui, gli altri attori danno vita a onesti ruoli di supporto (anche Garner risulta sacrificata e non \u00e8 particolarmente incisiva) con la sola eccezione di Jared Leto che \u2013 dopo una pausa di cinque anni \u2013 si toglie una decina di chili per incarnare un/una Rayon molto femminile: una bella prova solo messa un po\u2019 in ombra da quella di McConaughey che magari fa un po\u2019 la figura di quei chitarristi abbonati all\u2019assolo che mettono in secondo piano il resto della band ma, tutto sommato, meriterebbe proprio l\u2019Oscar."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "In Jean-Marc Vallee's \"Dallas Buyers Club,\" McConaughey and Leto bring near perfect performances and the talented writers weave in some bureaucratic intrigue along side a hefty amount of emotional depth, rendering the film into a worthy dramatic study of one man's shockingly true story."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Dallas Buyers Club chronicles the struggles of a man suffering from AIDS as he is shunned by friends and finds solace in the most unexpected of places. As he struggles to stay alive, he is forced to use medication that brings him into conflict with the authorities.\r We follow Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) as his previously cavalier lifestyle is brought to a standstill with the knowledge of his disease. His confession of his illness to a friend has an unexpected effect when he is perceived as a homosexual, even though he clearly loathes them. He straightens up and does some research, and when he discusses this with Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner), he finds that as long as a treatment is not approved by the FDA, there's no chance he can opt for it, despite its use in other parts of the world. AIDS brings him into contact with Rayon (Jared Leto). His hatred of gays resurfaces. But they are another misunderstood group of people who indulge in their feelings without bringing harm to anyone. Ron is evicted by his landlord and his walls are vandalized. Finally he gives up everything and heads after a rumour in Mexico. On his return he starts the Dallas Buyers Club, and attempts to spread medication not approved by the authorities.\r Somewhere along the way, he changes and looks at life differently. This development is surprising when it happens, and I applauded when he rose to the occasion instead of going down the easy path. Ron becomes a big businessman, travelling between different countries in order to circumvent law in bringing life saving drugs into his own country. His interactions with Dr. Eve (Jennifer Garner) are a source of great insight into the disease and much amusement on the side. We also get to see some of the hidden life and past of Rayon. Ron finally takes FDA to court to avail his right to his own treatment.\r Matthew McConaughey has perhaps delivered the most shining performance of his career. Other than weight loss, which is what most actors go for when a role requires it, apart from weight gain, he created a character who was at once a southern hippy and low life yet had a peculiarly uplifting view of life.\r Jared Leto plays a cross dressing gay man who finds friendship in the reluctant Ron. Together they spend what time they have trying to keep other people suffering from AIDS alive.\r The script succeeded in imparting useful information about the disease and its possible cures and the development of medicine designed to keep the harmful effects of the virus at bay. But it did not achieve this at the expense of entertainment. The film was comical all the way.\r We also get to witness the dirty side of society_ the misconceptions people have about the disease and its patients, and their unforgivable behaviour when they unload their insecurities onto the hapless victims. Also portrayed is the behaviour of straight men towards homosexuals.\r The production design did a remarkable job given that the budget was negligible compared to other great movies nominated for the category of Best Picture. The environment of the 1980s and 1990s Texas, including the cars and dresses,  was convincing. The film succeeded in letting us glimpse into the daily life of that era as well as telling a good story with intriguing characters.\r Dallas Buyers Club is a must watch film because I don't really know any other that has dealt with the subject with this much depth."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Stars Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto certainly put themselves through the ringer here playing aids stricken characters, McConaughey even going as far as to shed a considerable amount of weight for his role. Economical editing propels the story forward and the two lead actors are superb even if the film suffers from a mid section that seems to lose some momentum. Things become very emotional at the end with Leto registering strongly in these scenes."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Day by day, movie by movie he's getting better and better. Who? Matthew McConaughey. I thought 'The Lincoln Lawyer' was his best, but then 'Mud' came and I was shocked about his performance. Now even better in this movie, in fact the best from all of them. The first thing popped out in my mind was the Christian Bale's 'The Machinist'. Because of his weight reduce for the role in the movie was phenomenal. In this movie as well McConaughey did same homework for a movie character and it was just awesome.\r You can ask anybody who saw the movie will say McConaughey's performance was astonishing. But you know what I surprised in the movie other than him, Jared Leto. You will gonna observe his next best performance in here only after 'Mr. Nobody'. Yeah, I was shocked by his appearance, he totally had the movie along with McConaughey.\r The movie was based on the real story about a person from the 80s who had HIV+. The movie briefs his struggle to survive against the dangerous disease as well fight against the law. The story was very good, it says 'no matter what, you never give up'. How far would you go to fight in order to survive when law and medicine failed its duty along with losing your best buddies. It was just like the other perspective of story to 'Puncture' where a man fights to prevent spreading this same disease.\r If 'The Machinist' for Christian Bale then 'Dallas Buyers Club' for Matthew McConaughey. He nailed it, the character was totally looked like from the state of Texas and none others would have been done like him. Definitely one of the front runners for OSCAR in the best actor category. This great performance will be a biggest breakthrough in his career for sure. And that makes he's in watch-out list from now on."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Since before the start of the new millennium until just after 2010, Matthew McConaughey\u2018s body of work was just that, a body that worked well on the screen for so many of the aimless, brainless onslaught of romantic/comedy disasters, in which he played the lead. In 1996, McConaughey played Jake Tyler Brigance in Joel Schumacher\u2018s A Time To Kill. Hailed as the best performance of his career, it seemed like, critically, that was the closest the actor would get to any praise.\r In 2011, McConaughey took the lead in Brad Furman\u2018s The Lincoln Lawyer, a by-the-number crime/mystery, where, McConaughey was able to flex some of his acting muscles as opposed to abdomen muscles. Since then, in what has been the most sudden and misunderstood acting turn in recent memory, McConaughey has reinvented his career and is continuing to be casted as a serious actor with serious acting skills.\r While the Texan acting inspiration has remolded his career in a time span that puts to shame that of Downey Jr. and Travolta, one of McConaughey\u2018s unflinching signature acting staples is his bold and proud Texan accent. And while I can\u2019t really imagine how a cowboy like himself was cast in Christopher Nolan\u2018s upcoming science fiction Interstellar, McConaughey and his accent were surely a match made in heaven for his role as the slowly weathering and dying HIV/AIDS patient Ron Woodruff.\r For Dallas Buyers Club, McConaughey and his accent worked exceptionally well. Quebecois director Jean-Marc Vallee helms McConaughey as Ron Woodruff; a rugged, homophobic, ultra-macho, bull-riding, money throwing,  playboy with no accord to anyone. Woodruff, a money hustling, chance taking electrician juggles his fortune, his luck, his women, and his job to make ends meet and live a somewhat fulfilling life. It isn\u2019t until an unexpected accident at work that leaves Woodruff hospitalized, giving him no choice but to make a difference in his life and the lives of many others.\r Upon learning of his recent HIV positive diagnostics and short thirty day life expectancy time span, Woodruff, reluctant to die, uses his hustling, smooth-talking, greasing ways to secure him a new, untested medicine to prolong the spread of HIV, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved AZT. After consuming an uncontrolled amount of AZT, the only legal drug that was available at the time in the United States, all the while, still abusing his substances, Woodruff has a close encounter with death. Coming to the morbid realization that the ATZ was depleting his longevity, he enlists the help of a disgraced doctor (Griffin Dunne) and together bring unapproved anti-viral treatments to the U.S illegally. What starts off as a simple economic money tapping market venture, Woodruff, along the way, comes to the realization that his efforts to help others, are actually working. Enlisting the help of fellow HID/AIDS victim Rayon (Jared Leto), the two start the Dallas Buyers Club, an alternative treatment centre for paying members that pits Woodruff in a gestating face-to-face with the FDA and other pharmaceutical companies. As the clientele grows thanks to Rayon\u2019s introduction to the biggest HIV/AIDS demographic, homosexuals, Woodruff has a revelation that not only changes his opinion of gays but also is a deep and dark look of sexual discrimination in the south of the U.S in the 1980\u2032s.\r Dallas Buyers Club is a film dependent on the skills of its actors physical and mental performances. Aside from McConaughey\u2018s drastic forty pound weight loss, supporting actor Jared Leto dropped a hefty amount of weight to play the utterly convincing transsexual Rayon. Veering far away from Christian Bale comparisons in his eerie and grotesque turn as Trevor Reznik in Brad Anderson 2004\u2032s indie The Machinist, the two leads in the Dallas Buyers Club abandon physical spectacle in exchange for allowing their on-screen presence to give a candid, historical accuracy of HIV/AIDS patients, and the brutal struggle they faced against a deadly and unforgiving epidemic in the United States in the 1980\u2032s.\r Dallas Buyers Club is McConaughey\u2019s best role yet. Fierce, trashy and edifying, the actor substitutes humility for profanity, glamour for wretchedness, and the light-hearted for the heavy and unapologetic. Finally, McConaughey joins a club of actors that he should be proud to be a part of.\r Although the year\u2019s lead actor category is going to be a full one at this year\u2019s Academy Awards, the Supporting Actor category will have a  clear winner. Unrecognizable, subtle and submerged into the role, their is no deny or ignoring the raw talent Leto brings to the role of Rayon. His previous efforts as a dedicated method actor, either gaining a large amount of weight or shedding weight with a wink of an eye, Leto\u2018s dedication to the craft is showcased in Dallas Buyers Club, and will surely be rewarded."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Dallas Buyers Club is a performance movie. If you don\u2019t know what that is it means a movie relies on its actors and actresses to carry the plot. Usually this is because the plot is terrible and has no depth whatsoever, but the plot is one of the best things about Dallas Buyers Club. You probably know that it is based on true events and some of the stuff Ron Woodroof got away with is almost unbelievable. And it makes brilliant entertainment. But as I have mentioned this is a performance movie and the strongest thing about it are the performances. Matthew McConaughey is amazing and I think the reason behind it is he has just had what some are calling a McConnaissance, he has had a career change and is now planning to do more serious roles and less crappy rom-coms. Jared Leto I think is just as good, he plays a transvestite. And is not a transvestite in real life. That is a hard thing to pull off. But he does it extremely well and the hair and makeup artists perfectly show his descent into extreme illness. All of the supporting cast are brilliant aswell and compliment the lead cast while staying Oscar worthy, of course they haven\u2019t even been nominated that\u2019s how the Academy works. The only things about Dallas Buyers Club which I didn\u2019t like were that I had no idea who some characters were, they just sort of turned up. And the last shot was slightly clich\u00e9d, not the whole ending that was almost perfect. It was just the last shot felt a bit overly philosophical when it wasn\u2019t actually philosophical in any way. However Dallas Buyers Club is a hugely enjoyable and very intelligent movie overall, mainly due to the two leads Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto who practically carry the whole movie."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Incredible Performances, an incredible true story, and an amazing soundtrack.

This movie is not easy to watch with the homophobic slurs and imagery, but the performance from Matthew McConaughey stands as the years best with Jared Leto bringing in an equally impressive performance as Rayon. I was not entertained, but inspired throughout as this movie is more of a character study on Ronald Woodroof rather than an explanation of historical events. It serves its purpose well as the movie takes its spot as one of the best movies of 2013."}], "recommendations": ["richard_jewell", "the_danish_girl", "philadelphia", "judas_and_the_black_messiah", "the_mauritanian", "just_mercy", "hidden_figures", "brothers", "bombshell", "spotlight", "the_imitation_game", "the_last_king_of_scotland", "fences", "the_post", "the_founder", "only_the_brave", "nightcrawler", "gold", "gifted", "jackie", "wall_street", "still_alice", "the_judge", "the_fighter", "a_bronx_tale"]}
