Let's start from the simple points...\r ...The story mainly focuses on a family of dinosaurs which mainly consists of a father (voiced by Jeffery Wright), a mother (Frances McDormand) and three little children...the main one is Arlo (Raymond Ochoa).\r Arlo is pretty much like any Disney or Pixar protagonist you have seen before...a vulnerable little boy who is scared and inexperienced in life and the outside world. The story is essentially 'The Lion King' (1994) and 'Finding Nemo' (2003).\r Arlo ends up missing long away from home and finds a young toddler boy who he befriends throughout his journey as they try to survive finding food and keeping away from the storm.\r Arlo ends up coming across a T-Rex family, the lead who is the father named Butch (Sam Elliott) that teaches Arlo that there is nothing wrong with being scared, as long as you survive, then you will be fine.\r 'The Good Dinosaur' is pretty pain-by-numbers in terms of storytelling...it isn't as inventive as Pixar's previous feature 'Inside Out' (2015), a movie that nearly brought me to tears (and I rated it 10/10). Like I said earlier...it's similar to 'The Lion King' (1994) and 'Finding Nemo' (2003), the fact that it focuses on a father-and-son relationship and the son goes on an adventure to go from a boy to a man.\r It's a good feature debut for director Peter Sohn, who directed the short 'Partly Cloudy' (2009). Sohn may not be among the Pixar juggernauts like John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton and Brad Bird...but he could end up getting better after a couple of more features.\r All in all, 'The Good Dinosaur' is good Pixar fare...it may not be up there with 'Toy Story' (1995), 'Finding Nemo' (2003), 'The Incredibles' (2004) or even 'Inside Out' (2015)...but it is certainly better than 'Cars 2' (2011) and 'Brave' (2012)...however...it's a movie with great animation, great music and the funny moments are funny, and the sad moments are sad...like most Pixar films."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I've always had a soft spot for Pixar movies and I went into this with high expectations. I was not disappointed but it is definitely not as good as some other features they have made like toy story and up, but this film is still very fun like every Pixar movies. The backdrops look very very realalistic but the characters are very cartoony like they are in every Pixar movie and I like that. I thought the story was just ok. Not great but not bad just great. It is worth checking out but I don't think it stands out next to the other Pixar movies."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Is this top tier Pixar? No, it's not. But is it bad? No, not really. The narrative is simple and overly episodic, the message is simple, the central conceit is odd and possibly of little value (why is featuring dinosaurs in a western any better than just doing a western?), the film doesn't make use of it's own ticking clock device very well and the design choices probably won't work for everyone. However, the incredibly strong character work, especially the central relationship between Arlo and Spot, carry the film over these rough patches and make it all work on a visceral emotional level without ever tipping into manipulation. It doesn't hurt that this is the most visually stunning work that Pixar has ever done. So, it won't live along side Toy Story, Up and Inside Out, but it's better than Cars. Take that for what it's worth."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I was expecting the movie to do a lot better than Inside Out.

Don't listen to the other reviews, it is a very great story. It follows Arlo and Spot, Arlo is a dinosaur that acts like a human and Spot is a human that acts like a dog.

Although it might not had the great impact that previous Pixar films have had in the past - it still managed to make a great impact with its characters, colorful environment and story.

The story did a feel a bit bare though, and it felt a lot shorter than it was.\rThe visuals and the soundtrack were great, but it just felt like a poor attempt to live up to other pixar films like Toy Story. While I understand the challenge of having a mute main character, Arlo has somewhat of an annoying voice.\rWhat there is of a story is entertaining however, but I do wish it was a bit more fleshed out. Action scenes are no more than a few minutes long and the rest of the film is fairly uninteresting"}, {"rating": "6", "text": "The Good Dinosaur is a disappointing film.  The rich, complex environments are a stark contrast to weak, uninspiring characters.  The overall story arc is about as predictable as they come, but held against Pixar standards it's simply astounding this film was made.  There are definite moments of well timed comedy, but again, these are strangely offset by poor pacing and a meandering plot.\r As if this strange outlier of Pixar misfires isn't enough to make you scratch your head, consider feeding your head first as The Good Dinosaur actually includes a scene in which the protagonists consume psychotropic wild berries.  Go ask Alice.  I think she'll know why The Good Dinosaur defies logic and proportion."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "The Good Dinosaur is an animated comedy-drama adventure film and the 16th Pixar animated movie. It is directed by Peter Sohn and written by Meg LeFauve.\rThe movie asks the question, what if the asteroid that supposedly wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago, missed ? The main character is Arlo, a young dinosaur who lives with his parents and two siblings at a farm. After a tragedy occurs with a close member of his family, he then has to go on an adventure, where he will learn many things and even befriend a human being, Spot.\rThis movie is just great in every sense of the word. I genuinely do not get all the hate that this has received, I mean sure it got a very good and certified fresh 76% rating on Rotten Tomatoes but many people are calling this as a disappointment simply because it is not the next Toy Story or whatever. Grow up people, cause not everything Pixar does is going to be perfect, and if you can't accept that then the problem is with you, and not the movie.\rThis is definitely one of the best looking animated movies ever made. Sure the characters are not as real looking as the landscapes in the background but you have to remember that this is an animated movie, and usually they are meant for kids who really do not care if a movie looks perfectly real or not. If the character designs are your problem that you're definitely just nitpicking.\rThe voice cast is brilliant all around, and maybe it doesn't have stand out voice performances like Inside Out does but then again, Inside Out is one of the best animated movies ever made so you can't really compare these two simply because they were made by the same production company. The Good Dinosaur is also very touching and heartfelt with a very good message, plus it is for adults too with many jokes that kids will surely not understand but the older can enjoy and appreciate. So basically there's something for everyone here and yet again it made the least money for any Pixar movie ever, which is just stupid.\rI hope people buy this more on Blu-Ray and DVD so that it does not continue to be as underrated as it as right now."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "The Good Dinosaur, although an adequate family film, lacks qualities that have made many of Pixar\u2019s previous productions classics. Less a major animated effort than a late-autumn \u201cfiller\u201d, the movie offers enough to enthrall children without boring parents but, at the same time, fails to provide the thematic depth and richness on offer in such previous titles like Toy Story 3, The Incredibles, and WALL-E. To that extent, The Good Dinosaur is a disappointment, although most viewers who pay $10 to see it likely won\u2019t regret the purchase.\r The Good Dinosaur had a troubled production history and that may have been the root cause of the on-screen problems. It spent nearly six years in development and two years ago underwent a reconstruction with major rewrites, the jettisoning of the director and most of the original voice cast, and a \u201crepurposing\u201d of the project. Although Disney claims to be \u201cvery pleased\u201d with the end result, The Good Dinosaur\u2019s meandering storyline shows signs of what may have concerned the studio.\r The film offers a variety of cobbled together genres. The early scenes echo themes and moments from The Lion King and The Jungle Book. A majority of the running time represents a road trip with buddy film elements. Portions of the second half pay homage to the Western, complete with a campfire, a round-up, musical cues inspired by The Magnificent Seven, and the gravelly intonations of Sam Elliott. The typical Disney messages about tolerance, friendship, and perseverance are in evidence but they seem obligatory and are clumsily integrated.\r The opening sequence provides setup to explain (for anyone who cares\u2026) the Flintstones-friendly co-existence of humans and dinosaurs during the same era. The asteroid hypothesized to have caused the mass extinction event misses the Earth, allowing the behemoths to continue their existence unimpeded by global climate change.  Several million years later, dinosaurs have developed into anthropomorphized creatures while humans favor walking on all fours and yapping like dogs. The Good Dinosaur\u2019s hero, Arlo (voice of Raymond Ochoa), is the youngest member of an Apatosaurus (a.k.a. \u201cBrontosaurus\u201d) family - Dad (Jeffrey Wright), Mom (Frances McDormand), and three kids. They\u2019re farmers, stocking up for the winter. But they have a \u201cpest\u201d problem - a human child (later named \u201cSpot\u201d) is sneaking into their stores and eating their corn. Dad tasks Arlo with the chore of exterminating the intruder. But the young dinosaur can\u2019t bring himself to kill. A chase ensues and, when Arlo and his father are caught in a sudden storm, tragedy occurs. The rest of the movie follows Arlo and Spot, swept away by a river to a far-off place, as they make the homeward journey.\r Visually, The Good Dinosaur boasts some of the most amazingly photo-realistic sets I have seen in any animated film. There are times when it appears as if the filmmakers inserted the characters/creatures into real world footage. The water scenes - often troublesome in animated films - are flawlessly rendered. If The Good Dinosaur falls short in the narrative department, it represents a step forward for Pixar\u2019s artists.  The realism of the surroundings makes the dinosaurs seem more cute and cartoonish than they might otherwise. It\u2019s a conscious choice since photo-realistic dinosaurs might be too frightening for young children. After all, this isn\u2019t Jurassic World.\r A role reversal casts a non-human as the chatty protagonist and a (prehistoric) homo sapien as the sidekick/pet. Although it\u2019s an accepted conceit that animals often talk in Disney movies, few are as verbally skilled as Arlo. And Spot (thus named to re-inforce his similarities to a loyal canine) never utters a word, although he scratches himself and howls from time-to-time. Unfortunately, this clever inversion doesn\u2019t make either Arlo or Spot more interesting. They\u2019re generic cookie-cutter characters.\r The pace, as is often the case with road movies regardless of the species of the protagonists or the terrain through which they travel, is uneven. There are long stretches when little happens punctuated by action set pieces.  Many \u201cpopular\u201d dinosaurs make appearances, including T-Rexes and velociraptors. Perhaps the best moment comes during an understated scene where Arlo and Spot, who don\u2019t share a language, use sticks to communicate. There\u2019s emotion and pathos in this sequence - something the rest of the movie could have used more of.\r The problem is that the film\u2019s uncertain narrative creates a variable viewing experience. Despite some of Pixar\u2019s recent failures, there\u2019s still an expectation that anything with their name attached with be better than features produced by their rivals, but that\u2019s not the case with The Good Dinosaur. The movie isn\u2019t appreciably better or worse than a Madagascar or an Ice Age. It\u2019s top-quality animation in service of a less than top-quality script."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I might of posted this before, but here it is again.One of the most underrated films I have ever seen, by FAR. It is one of the best films I have ever seen in general and deserves more attention then what it got. This movie sent me on an emotional roller-coaster ride, that no film has ever done for me before. This movie makes you emotionally engaged with not just the beautiful CGI, but also the characters in, once again, a way that has never done for me before as well. Just look up 1 picture of Arlo smiling and tell me that you don't want to smile at that. Exactly, no matter how hard I try, I just smile at it. So by far, an amazing film and honestly, in my eyes, this is the best of Pixar. DEFINATLEY go check this out."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "The Good Dinosaur is a fun enough movie, filled with the usual Disney-cliche where the parent dies and the kid feels a need to prove themselves. After timid and runt-of-the-litter dinosaur Arlo is swept away from home by a raging river, he begins his long adventure back home. Along the way, he meets a human child who acts very much like an uncivilized dog. Arlo names the child \u201cSpot\u201d and the two go on their adventure back home, meeting lots of new characters along the way. In conclusion, The Good Dinosaur is not exactly anything special, but it\u2019s a heartwarming story about friendship and family. It does good in most parts, but when it falls, the plunder is evident. If you want something to do for a good hour, put this movie on. You may not be particularly enthralled, and you may not be moved at all when the credits roll by on-screen, but at least Spot is cute."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "So I never really felt the urge to watch this movie as I'm not really interested in dinosaurs and the promos for the movie didn\u2019t look too interesting to me. Today it was recommended to me on Disney Plus so I decided to watch it and damn I did not expect to like it this much.One thing that was pretty unexpected was the role distribution. I expected for Arlo (the dinosaur) to be more like an animal that can\u2019t talk and is treated like a pet and the boy, Spot, to talk and teach him things but it\u2019s the exact opposite. Arlo can talk, while Spot doesn\u2019t say a word and behaves like a dog. That was quite a suprise and a nice change since it\u2019s usually always the other way around in movies like this.The next thing that I want to point out is the incredible animation. The animation is so good, the landscapes literally look real. Especially the water impressed me. Of course, the characters look more cartoonish because they aren\u2019t supposed to look too realistic and are supposed to stand out but damn the landscapes and backgrounds? Beautiful.The plot reminds me a lot of \"Finding Nemo\" in some parts. A little boy who is not that brave and is different than the others gets lost and has to find his way back home and he gets help from others and finds new friends but also meets bad people along the way. Of course, a parent also dies while we\u2019re at it (Arlo's father). So the plot is pretty predictable. Only after a few minutes I already knew that his father would die and then he did exactly in the moment where you'd expect him to die lol. That\u2019s one negative thing, the fact the plot is so predictable. Another bad thing is the way that the animals eat each other. I know it\u2019s part of nature and I\u2018d be okay with it if it wouldn\u2019t happen over and over again. They\u2019ve overdone it with the killing scenes in my opinion. The scene were Spot rips the head off of an insect can\u2019t be good for children. Otherwise, I thought the movie was beautiful. I cried three or four times throughout the movie. I love the way that Spot is used in this movie. He doesn\u2019t speak and has less screen time than you'd expect but he\u2019s so much more than just Arlo's friend or sidekick. He\u2019s kind of a metaphor. He steals the food on the farm and Arlo's father wants him to kill Spot. Arlo can\u2019t do it because he\u2019s too afraid of Spot. Arlo's father wants to help him beat his fear though and to do his job so they follow Spot and that\u2019s when Arlo's father dies. After his father's death, Arlo makes Spot responsible for his dad\u2018s death and wants to kill him the next time he sees him. They both get carried away by the stream and that\u2019s when their journey to find their way back home begins. On the way they face a lot of tough and dangerous situations and save each other multiple times. I\u2019m gonna stop describing the plot and come to the point. What I\u2018m trying to say here is that killing Spot was Arlo\u2019s job to get his mark and become brave but in the end, Arlo faced his fears and Spot was the one that helped him become brave. I can\u2019t really describe it better than that and I\u2018m probably not making any sense but yeah, Spot has a very important role here. So all in all, \"The Good Dinosaur\" is a beautiful, extremely well animated movie, which I did not really expect but I like to be suprised. There are some funny scenes but also some extremely sad scenes that\u2018ll make everyone cry. The ending is pretty abrupt but still a full circle moment that made me cry."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "My grandchildren absolutely love this movieWhy are there adults posting reviews it\u2019s a kids movieMy mrs and myself our daughter and hubby have sat with the kids at least 20 times each so yes we love it too"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "This movie has some flaws: the story is very straight forward, the animation doesn't focus on its tone, some non flashed out characters and those that are have little likeability in them.

It feels like one of those films played at Christmas to give you a warm good hearted feel and that\u2019s down to its good plot, great characters and its gorgeous animation even if the designs do feel like they slightly clash.  It\u2019s not the most original film in the world, but it\u2019s well made, well directed and it\u2019s clearly made with a lot of heart and soul and is designed to entertain both the kids and the adults watching.  Keep an eye out for this film because I reckon it will stick around for a while.  While the 3D is good and it had some good moments, though it\u2019s hardly essential.  The only major negative I had with this film was that its villains felt a bit tacked on and unnecessary."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Being an animator and having a huge love and respect for Pixar, I wanted to love this movie. I had been looking forward to it for months but it after seeing it I fell like they just missed the mark. The character design felt completely out of place from the environments and even between Spot and Arlo. The most obvious of all was the lack of story. It didn't seem like they really nailed down the story in the development phase before moving into production. Not their best one, but still had a few good laughs."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "The Good Dinosaur is one beautiful animated movie with many creativity elements in it, but the movie itself sadly doesn't hold up.

Was it the novelty of the CG animation in all its newness that eventually wore away over 20 years?  Have all the spins on familiar archetypal stories been used up?  Has the wit become par for the course?  I don't know exactly, but while I can see nothing particularly wrong with this movie, it didn't hold my interest strongly either.  All the elements seem to be in place and as astutely executed as ever with stunning visual detail and clever humor throughout.  The over-arching story is so familiar though.  This time it comes off as been there done that once too often, but for kids it's still great I'm sure.  The best of Pixar works exceedingly well for all."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "The Good Dinosaur may be perhaps one of the most frustrating viewing experiences I've had at any Pixar movie. On the one hand, it is one of the most technically impressive films the studio has done, with near photorealistic environments and incredible attention to detail in the characters. Furthermore, the characters are all, for the most part, quite memorable, and there are moments of excellent visual storytelling that match the studio's typical high mark in quality. At the same time, The Good Dinosaur has almost as many frustrating moments, where the plot falls into cliches, where the storytelling becomes on the nose and rushed, and where the bad parts often times stand out more, unfortunately, because of the glimmers of brilliance throughout. The Good Dinosaur still lives up to the name of being \"good\", but in a movie where it had the potential to be \"excellent\", I cannot say that I'm not slightly disappointed."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "After the visual masterpiece that is Inside Out, I thought Pixar had returned completely back to form, but its \"new\" directors continue to bring the company and its films down. The Good Dinosaur is not a film worthy of the Pixar name. Even though its animation is gorgeous and the relationship between Arlo and his human companion Spot is great, it struggles strongly in the story department. The film feels very formulaic and I became generally disinterested in it about 45 minutes in. It also has very simple themes which don't stand up, even in comparison to Pixar's worst films. It's a cute movie, but far from a great one due to its unoriginal and bland story. Pixar needs to utilize its vets rather than giving projects to its rookie directors."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "The Good Dinosaur is another highly enjoyable film from Pixar, even if it doesn't reach the heights of the studio's best. As can be expected from a Pixar film, the animation was stunning. I'd even go as far as to say, it just might be one of their most visually amazing films to date. It wasn't as deep or groundbreaking as \"Inside Out\" but when you think about it, few movies are. The protagonists, Arlo and Spot were both very likeable and Sam Elliot gave a solid vocal performance as Butch the T-Rex. Speaking of T-Rexes, I think Pixar deserve some recognition for making him a good guy rather than a villain or an obstacle, like most dinosaur movies do. As well as visually stunning, the movie was quite emotional- which isn't surprising for a Pixar movie. So overall, while it lacks the complexity of previous Pixar films, The Good Dinosaur makes up for this with beautiful animation and heartfelt emotion."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "For 2 years, Monsters University was the best Pixar movie I ever saw. Then this film came along. I got to say, when I saw the trailer for this movie, I was kind of disappointed. I expected this film to be terrible. But I saw the film and I didn't regret it. Not one bit. The film is my second favorite movie of all time currently. The animation is stellar, the characters are hilarious and the plot is incredible. So basically a kid named Arlo's dad dies (which is the first time that ever happened in a Pixar movie) and he blames the human-dog kid, soon to be named Spot. The two of them get lost in the middle of nowhere and try to get home. It has old classic Pixar comedy, and lots of fun voices, such as Jeffrey Wright, Sam Elliot and even Steve Zahn as the villain. In total, The Good Dinosaur is a definite watch and a 10/10."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "I'm really conflicted on this one. On the one hand, the photo-realistic landscapes are stunningly gorgeous and there are some shots (the setting sun and the T-Rex ranchers) that will take your breath away. Some of the best moments in this film are told cinematically, without any dialogue whatsoever.\r On the other hand, the story is so basic and the beats so predictable that most adults will have checked out by the time the film takes its sweet time winding down to its conclusion, which seems more like a relief than a revelation.\r Don't get me wrong, there are some seriously quality scenes (the campfire with the T-Rexes, the way Arlo learns to swim, the 'howling' scene) but the whole is way less than the sum of its parts (some of which strongly resemble \"The Lion King\" and \"The Land Before Time\", both of which are clearly better films). Director Pete Sohn does his best and nails the visual tone poem side of things, but there's really only so far you can take this bare-bones coming-of-age-and-overcoming-your-fears story, especially since Pixar's \"storyboard-by-committee\" technique has lately resulted in their films playing it super safe so that the message translates into global box office. I'm fine with people all over the world being able to relate to their films on a deep level, but when shooting for the lowest common denominator gets to the point of robbing the work of personality and leaving the audience with a third act that runs on cruise control, it's time to dial it back a notch.\r When your kid-friendly dinosaur film gets most of its personality from characters' accents, that's when you know the fact that your leads are actual DINOSAURS is underutilized and under-emphasized (throughout, the movie plays it straight, treating dinosaurs as Wild West-era Americans, and Spot as a kind of dog-human hybrid). The lead, Arlo, is actually one of the film's big problems, because the kid that voices him is so annoying I wanted to walk into the voice recording booth and shove a sock in his mouth.\r Also, just so you all know, the dinosaurs are not meant to represent actual dinosaurs, but rather dinosaurs as they might have been in something likely closer to modern times had they not been wiped out.\r I have been a Pixar fan since the beginning, but after \"Up\", their output has been really uneven, with the exception of \"Inside Out\", which was really well put-together but did not portray the workings of the brain with anything resembling reality. With \"The Good Dinosaur,\" if Pixar either eschewed a script altogether and made an experimental dialogue-free film that emphasized the landscapes and mise-en-scene, or cranked out a halfway decent script that wasn't riddled with cliches, this might have even been deserving of being ranked with the likes of \"Wall-E\" and \"Finding Nemo\". Instead, it's just slightly better than \"Brave\" and \"Cars 2\".\r I am giving this a 6 because I felt like it could have been so much more. Everything about this film is a missed opportunity. It was a waste of some beautiful backgrounds to pair them up with such ugly character designs, a waste of great voice talent by having them recite a script that nearly put me to sleep, and a waste of the time of their adult audience members, whose kids will probably enjoy this film once or twice but quickly get bored."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Ok, I honestly do not get what the mixed and negative comments are all about-because this movie was breathtaking.

I get easily moved by movies, but hardly ever cry. In this movie, I actually cried at the beauty, symbolism, and heart-warming feels which Disney and Pixar surely delivered on.

The voice actors are great, the story is very simple  and not that original, but coherent and investing and the strongest point of the film besides a technical tour de force, is its heart. It is very emotionally rich and gut wrenching at times.

This new take on dinosaurs was interesting to see play out, but the movie seemed to get lost at the point where it is so focused on Arlo earning his mark and becoming a part of the family. That is where the magic was lost.\r With unexpected frights and turns mixed in, the movie retained some quality. It was scary enough for the kids in the theater to whimper in distress. I just wonder why Pixar felt the need to follow this stereotypical storyline and arc of returning home and proving one's self worth.\r Spot being a human was not as much of a surprise or oddity as the creators would have liked us to believe \u2013 this is an imaginative world, after all. Anything is possible, but instead we are sticking with the beings that we are \u2013 and a world that we know has never existed. Humans and dinosaurs do not exist together.

Why they didn't do betters designs and look realistic as Dinosaur (2000)?. and I thought it would be the worst of Pixar, but it is not so bad.

Pixar most unusual short plays before the feature: \"Sanjay's Super Team\" is about an Indian boy who intersperses his superheroes with Hindu gods."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "The really wild bunch\u2026\r Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication, was a phrase the late Pixar co-founder Steve Jobs was fond of, and it could almost be a maxim for The Good Dinosaur. 2015 marks the first time two Pixar films have been released in one year, and in a lot of respects, this second effort couldn't be more different from summer\u2019s Inside Out.\r While the first 2015 Pixar film out of the gate gloried in its complexity, personifying emotions and making tweenage brain processes of a piece with the action, The Good Dinosaur \u2013 as the title hints \u2013 feels at heart like a child\u2019s picture book, from the bright, colourful characters, to the simple linear plot.\r That comparison isn\u2019t intended as an insult; this is a rich and rewarding family film. That it doesn\u2019t quite reach Pixar\u2019s highest standards for invention and storytelling verve is unfortunately exacerbated by its proximity to the insta-masterpiece released earlier this year.\r The fact that two Pixar films ended up being released in the same year is down to well-documented production problems: The Good Dinosaur was postponed when original co-director Bob Peterson was moved to a different project, leaving Peter Sohn (director of short Partly Cloudy) solely at the helm.\r The film that\u2019s been salvaged kicks off 65 million years ago, with the asteroid destined to destroy Earth narrowly missing, meaning that some millions of years later, humans and dinosaurs co-exist.\r As the story proper begins, dino-parents Momma (Frances McDormand) and Poppa (Jeffrey Wright) raise three kids on their farm. Gangly Arlo (voiced by Jack McGraw, and later, when he\u2019s a little older, by Raymond Ochoa) is the runt of the litter, struggling to live up to his father\u2019s expectations.\r Oddly, the family are farmers, ploughing fields and tending to crops, but this particular concept of industrial dinosaurs isn't really explored much after tragedy strikes and Arlo finds himself lost in the wilderness, with only a feral human child named Spot for company. Maybe the idea was played down as part of the behind-the-scenes shake-up, as none of the other dinosaurs Arlo encounters on his journey have evolved to use machinery.\r A four-legged, long-necked klutz, Arlo is ostensibly an Apatosaurus, but that sort of information isn't offered up readily. The filmmakers might earn a few science points for giving some Velociraptor-like beasts feathers, but it\u2019s likely that these dinosaurs will simply be classified as \u2018the green one\u2019, \u2018the funny one\u2019, \u2018the scary one\u2019, as opposed to any technical genus. It feels like a confident, conscious decision, rather than a lack of research (although as is always the case, the food chain is glossed over).\r The bold hues of the prehistoric creatures only stand to make the mountainous backdrops all the more stunning. Paying homage to the western with lush ranges and treacherous rivers (even some cattle herding), the scenery is among the most beautiful to ever spring from a computer, and the rain is so gorgeously executed you can practically smell it.\r That landscape certainly gives Arlo a rough time of it \u2013 battered, bruised and tormented, he\u2019s one of the more put-upon animated heroes of recent times, and some of the rival species he comes across could prove a touch too scary for the youngest viewers. One scene, in which a pack of helpers turn threatening on a dime is genuinely tense. There\u2019s also a nice balance of adult-friendly gags (fermented berries! Paranoid triceratops!) thrown in with the visual humour, while pop-culture references are pretty much absent.\r Where TGD really comes into its own is in Arlo\u2019s interactions with Spot. Sohn has always been upfront about this being a \u2018boy and his dog\u2019 story, with the killer Pixar twist here being that the human is the dog. Arlo and Spot form the customary road-tripping odd couple that\u2019s become as much as mark of Pixar as the Luxo lamp.\r While Arlo will no doubt sell more merchandise, Spot is an incredible creation, skittish, snarling, scrambling around on all fours. The inevitable relationship that develops between the two has real heart, and will have you feigning grit in your eye more than once. In one of the finest moments, Sohn musters more emotion with stick figures and dirt than lesser animations manage in a whole movie.\r Certain flaws keep The Good Dinosaur from earning a spot on the Pixar podium. For all the scares thrown in en route, it never really feels that Arlo is ever that far away from home. The parental figures have a tendency to talk in platitudes, and the human/prehistoric creatures don\u2019t feel as fresh as some other Pixar creations; this territory won't feel entirely unfamiliar to anyone who's seen Ice Age or The Croods. But for a film of uncomplicated pleasures, there's much to delight in.\r Simple but effective, The Good Dinosaur doesn\u2019t reinvent the wheel, but it\u2019s still damn fine family entertainment.

But hey-- that's not a great sign is it??\r What makes this film unique and interesting? It starts and ends with the premise. \"What if the Dinosaurs survived? What happens then?\" Apparently, not much! I don't even know how the premise relates to the actual story... If altering the course of the earth and creating a parallel universe was all just so some little kid could meet up with a dinosaur and become 'sorta friends'.. then I'm sorry, that's just a total waste of a premise.\r From there on, you can approach this film two ways: Frustratingly illogical... or just incredibly bland and repetitive. I understand the production underwent a lot of revisions/problems and there were probably 30 uncredited writers on the film. It definitely shows. It feels safe and at times lacking strong direction or purpose. Why's the main character the 'Good' Dinosaur anyway? What did he do that was so good? And why the hell are they farming?? How the hell did they figure out how to farm? How many animals are smart enough to start farming? Why not give them blue jeans and eyeglasses while you're at it?\r The worst was the last scene, that was begging to be a tear jerker; in the end the dinosaur and the kid can't be together. The kid needs to be taken in by some RANDOM FAMILY THAT HE NEVER MET IN HIS LIFE. Why would you leave this kid with a bunch of strangers, that for all we know could be cannibals?? Why can't he just stay with his dinosaur friend? Because they don't look the same? Isn't that called segregation?\r Ohhh I know. Because they want to make it all sad and touchy-feely. Fine. Whatever. I'm tearing up because of how hard it's trying. It's pathetic. And it's just a terrible message.\r Aside from the story, I was not very impressed with the characters designs (aside from maybe the little cave boy) or art direction. They just felt super basic and unoriginal. A lot of the secondary characters felt like they were lifted right out of Ice Age. Sure, the environments felt super realistic and golly gee whiz, that sure is a great accomplishment. Technically. But c'mon.. how about being creative with things? If I want to see a photo realistic flower... I'll watch National Geographic. You just spent millions of dollars trying to make a 3D tree look like a real tree... why not just shoot video of a real tree if that's what you want.

But Disney/Pixar, and we the public audience along with it, have set the bar pretty high for its films. When \u201cFinding Nemo\u201d was announced, I scoffed at the idea of a movie about the ocean and a couple fish. I watched it, and it became one of my favorite movies. \u201cToy Story 3\u201d came out years after its predecessors, and it brought along a darker tone and heavier moments, but it all worked so well and we felt like we were continuing life\u2019s journey with the favorite childhood toy characters again. I generally liked all Pixar/Disney movies, to varying degrees. That being said, I definitely had high hopes for \u201cThe Good Dinosaur.\u201d After all, dinosaurs alone sound more exciting than a couple of fish in the sea, right?\r [SPOILER ALERT]\r\u201cThe Good Dinosaur\u201d (TGD) has its moments. There are the clear values of family and the life lesson of growing up and facing your fears (seriously, that is mentioned aloud how many times in the movie?). There are the emotional, tear-jerking scenes. There is character development and growth (to an extent) in an obvious plotline.\rBut something about \u201cTGD\u201d was different. What sticks out the most is the portrayal of the human characters in this alternate universe. Some may call it dehumanizing, because that\u2019s exactly what it is. But that word only makes sense in a world where we have become the top intellectual species. It\u2019s humbling (and amusing) to think of what might have been if the history of the Earth had taken a different path. So I could suspend the awkward feelings I initially had when I first saw Spot, thinking it would ultimately teach a lesson about us humans in the world (just as \u201cWall-E\u201d criticized society). But I doubt TGD meant anything more by it than I already mentioned; it was just an alternate universe where humans did not come out on top.\r There were a lot of scenes atypical of Disney/Pixar movies. They caught me by surprise. The movie didn\u2019t seem completely kid-friendly, a notion validated by its \u201cPG\u201d rating. There were barbaric moments, including Spot with the bug\u2019s head and Thunderclaw with the \u201cfree critter.\u201d I really had to ask myself, \u201cIs this really a Disney/Pixar movie?? This movie just keeps getting weirder.\u201d So by the time Spot took a chunk out of Thunderclaw\u2019s wing, I was unfazed. Then there was the moment with the bad fruit/psychedelic/drug-suggesting scene. Was that really necessary??\r Ultimately, TGD ended too soon for me. Not as in \u201cthis movie is so good I need more of it!\u201d but rather, it felt incomplete. Personally, I didn\u2019t experience catharsis (the emotional release you feel at the end of a story/movie when everything is resolved). I still had questions, and I\u2019m not sure I was OK with how everything worked out. Arlo\u2019s \u201cPoppa\u201d died, and Arlo no longer blamed it on Spot. I\u2019m guessing Arlo realized that if he hadn\u2019t been afraid to do his \u201cjob\u201d earlier, his father would still be alive. So Arlo realizes the blame lies largely with him and his fears. But his job was to MURDER a critter (Spot), and what lesson was his dad teaching him there? Hello, is this a Disney/Pixar movie, advocating killing?? Poppa was quite nonchalant about it, too. Ignoring that, has Arlo vindicated himself by the end? Has he grown enough to compensate for his father\u2019s death? That I am not sure of. There\u2019s also that weird moment with Arlo talking to his Poppa in his imagination, and Arlo exclaims that he loves Spot. Uhm, weird, even just the WAY he said it. Half the movie, he blames Spot for his father\u2019s tragic death, and then Arlo loves Spot like a young boy loves his beloved pet dog. Character growth/development? I guess\r Then there are the logical flaws, but suspension of disbelief is required in most movies. For fun, I\u2019ll still point out a few. Somehow, Spot travels the entire distance Arlo got washed down the river. That is impressive, judging by the return journey Arlo takes home. Secondly, Arlo gets caught full force by the mudslide/raging torrents of water AND falls down a waterfall, and somehow survives. But his tough Poppa died from a similar fate??  Not to mention the endless hits Arlo sustained to his head. And lastly, just to be nit-picky, Arlo draws the circle in the ground around Spot and his family without moving from his standing spot. He\u2019s not tall enough nor does he have a neck long enough to realistically do that.\rI look at the positives of this film. The scenery and animations are gorgeous, top-notched. Emotions are jerked, laughs had. Lessons can be found. There are clever play on words/ideas (storm birds, the scene with their \u201chead in the clouds,\u201d Spot as a \u201clone wolf\u201d).Let\u2019s say that I accept that the film requires a more mature perspective, and that the uncharacteristic scenes mentioned above ultimately don\u2019t bother me. Would I say TGD is a good movie? Sadly no. It was just lacking for me. It didn\u2019t feel as complete as all of Disney/Pixar\u2019s other works."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Now this might stir some controversy but I\u2019m going to say it anyway; I enjoyed The Good Dinosaur more than Inside Out. Now let me explain.\rTGD has a far more typical and formulaic plot and premise to what was happening which is why it may not have been seen as highly as Inside Out due to that having its original premise, but TGD\u2019s is far more fully realised and executed better.\rI found the film was more emotional, with the reason for the events of the film taking place actually making me a bit upset due to how well they executed it. Albeit this, the film has more laughs per minute than Inside Out and hits its jokes well. The film is oddly a bit more mature, with a hysterical but rather worrying drug trip sequence and even Dinosaurs eating other Dinosaurs on screen. I mean WHAT THE F**K\u2026. a kid bites off a bugs head. It\u2019s savage and kinda shocking but also makes you laugh at how unexpected it is! I think this adds a more serious tone over the film which is why it is a PG but it is still definitely a kids film. I mean look at it like this kids aren\u2019t stupid; if they like Dinosaurs or know anything about Dinosaurs then they know they eat each other. Don\u2019t undermine then and speak on behalf of them saying they will not enjoy that.\rNow, the animation in this film is by far the best Pixar have ever released. Everything almost looks real, with photorealistic water and focus shots that really make it a cinematic marvel to be honest. The characters in the film are all pretty quirky too, and really offer up some loveable and memorable ones that add to the film. I also prefer the character design to Inside Out\u2019s, as I found them a bit too glittery and fluffy In animation.\rEither way, both films are great, but I think TGD is the better one really as it seriously takes risks and gets rewarded for it. I would like to see more from Peter Sohn at Pixar, he really has a good eye for things and the writers did a great job. Additionally, I must say I think the ending was played on between the two main characters a little too much, but hardly detracts from the rest of this films charm. I will round my score up as I think it deserves it.
