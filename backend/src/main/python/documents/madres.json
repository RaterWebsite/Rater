      "text": "I found it more competent than I initially expected because it manages to invoke a good atmosphere of suspense and an engaging mystery.However, as this mystery begins to unfold, the story also starts to lose pace and impact, and its final act responds more to a portion of anguish rather than horror.The closing with the mention of eugenics applied to immigrants feels gratuitous and insubstantial because it seems like a device that tries to justify this story in general, but fails in a resounding way to give a real voice to that issue."
