      "text": "I came in not expecting too much but was very happy with the film.\r Yes there were a few throwaway tribute gags to the old boxing films and by half way through things get a little predictable. But I can enjoy the virtues of the film.\r The problem with modern films to me is that characters do things that don't make sense and just act to move the film forward, this incongruence is glaring but in this case each character was actually acting in character.\r Not really a fan of DeNiro, his performances are usually that showy, he doesn't usually play an actual human being more panto villain. Stallone was his usual old self and didn't embarrass himself and everyone else in the case were great, Arkin didn't emulate Meredith at all which was a great choice and Hart was pretty amusing as the comedy relief.\r The critic snobbery is of course no surprise, they hate anything with Stallone, this is fact. They could have written their reviews months ago, they are that predictable.\r I'm giving it a ten because I liked the characters and script that's what I'm all about."

      "text": "Sylvester Stallone and Robert De Niro play ex-boxers who never settled their rivalry (in the ring and in love), so they decide to stage a final bout. These two screen icons toss around age and fat jokes, but mostly play the drama. Luckily, Adam Arkin provides crusty comic commentary and Kevin Hart brings wise ass chatter. Still, the script is only occasionally amusing, painfully predictable and not at all compelling. If you insist on seeing it, be sure to sit thru the closing credits for two surprise cameos that create the film's funniest moment."

      "text": "A funny comedy with enough of a sentimental, feel good type story to keep viewers entertained. Both Stallone and De Niro do a fantastic job, and fans of their earlier works will get a kick out of seeing \"Rocky Balboa\" and \"Jake LaMotta\" duking it out in the ring. Supporting cast members Kevin Hart and Alan Arkin bring a lot of laughs.\r Overall it's a very enjoyable comedy, although I wouldn't call it a great one. It can be slow sometimes and some of the earlier attempts at humor do fall flat. Still, it end up managing to be both funny and enjoyable enough for me to recommend it for at least a rental. For my total score I give it a 7.8/10-Good."

The story is terrible and the character feel like they are written for guys in their 30s to 40s, Alan Arkin  is funny at times but then also very disgusting the same thing with Robert De Niro very disgusting he talked for a movie that came out for Christmas that families probably went to see. It is something to see just because Stallone and De Niro is in it but overall if you're not a fan of them then this is not something to see"

      "text": "Grudgematch's parts are somehow greater than it's whole. You have two legendary actors, Robert DeNiro and Sylvester Stallone. A great supporting cast including Alan Arkin and Kevin Heart. You have a great director and screenwriter. Through some misfortune, the movie itself nowhere near lives up to its premise. Robert DeNiro and Sylvester Stallone are great. Kevin Heart's character however, comes off as annoying and cringy. The score is uninspired and bland. Way too much time is spent on the personal relationship drama, and the fight that is promised does not live up to its expectations. The drama however, is quite well done, but when contrasted by Kevin Heart's spastic comedy, everything feels off. The script is way too safe and plays it by the book way too closely. There's not enough here to warrant more than one viewing, unfortunately."

Film buffs will enjoy seeing Rocky Balboa and Jake LaMotta fighting on the big screen. The movie will not survive as a classic, and makes a strange choice for Christmas, but offers a little more than expected."

The movie lacks intention that could have made it a really great experience.  Instead I felt like it was just OK.  If you're being selective about what to see in theaters right now, perhaps this one is best left until its available at a Redbox."

It doesn't really feel like you're watching a big rivalry between Sylvester Stallone and Robert DeNero, it feels more like slapstick comedy no one will remember, but never the less, it still brings in laughs and touches a little on the main stars. Overall, it's a decent re-hash of former Rocky and Jack! I give it a B-! Be sure to check out my YouTube channel, \"TheMovieManLife\" for all things movies."

Per\u00f2, stando al gioco, ci si diverte per un centinaio di minuti senza troppi pensieri: basta lasciarsi andare alla sfacciata inverosimiglianza e osservare i due vecchi leoni fare il verso al proprio passato e sovente gigioneggiare appoggiati a una storia in cui non mancano spunti e battute (dopo pochi minuti, De Niro proclama \u2018sono un grande attore\u2019 mentre a Stallone viene vietato di prendere a pugni i quarti di manzo in una cella frigorifera). Razor (Sly) e il Kid (Bob) si odiano da trent\u2019anni \u2013 da cui il titolo originale \u2018Il match del rancore\u2019 - per motivi sportivi e sentimentali: da quando il primo ha rinunciato al confronto che avrebbe dovuto sancire la superiorit\u00e0 di uno dei due (e alla boxe tutta) dopo che il secondo gli ha messo incinta la fidanzata (Basinger e, nelle immagini degli anni Ottanta, la figlia Ireland). Dante, il tascabile erede del vecchio promoter (un Kevin Hart che fa parecchio il verso a Eddie Murphy), prova a resuscitare la sfida per soldi e i due, dopo qualche tentennamento accettano: Razor ha un posto di lavoro traballante e mantiene il vecchio allenatore (Alan Arkin fa il Burt Young senza la vena di amarezza ma con un rumorosissimo apparecchio acustico) mentre Kid \u00e8 un vanaglorioso figlio di buona donna e non pu\u00f2 certo tirarsi indietro. Inizia cos\u00ec l\u2019allenamento parallelo, in cui si inserisce il figlio della colpa come manager di pap\u00e0, e si arriva alla grande sfida davanti a mezza Pittsburgh: dodici round di irreale scazzottamento a guardia bassa (del resto i due sono stati protagonisti di match cinematografici tra i pi\u00f9 sanguinolenti della storia) al termine del quale Razor grida \u2018Adrianaaaaaa\u2019 \u2013 no, ok, stavo scherzando \u2013 e Kid recupera un po\u2019 di dignit\u00e0. Ambientata in una periferia urbana abbastanza anonima, la sceneggiatura di Tim Kelleher e Rodney Rothman delinea due antagonisti tagliati con l\u2019accetta mettendo via via pi\u00f9 a fuoco il confronto tra un \u2018buono\u2019 e un \u2018cattivo\u2019 o, quantomeno, un \u2018simpatico\u2019 e un \u2018antipatico\u2019: Stallone \u00e8 monolitico come di prammatica nell\u2019interpretare il rude-ma-sensibile Razor mentre De Niro (il cui doppiaggio lo fa sempre sembrare strafatto di elio) utilizza il suo ghigno beffardo per rendere la meschinit\u00e0 che contraddistingue il suo personaggio. Il grande Bob d\u00e0 l\u2019impressione di divertirsi e rende assai di pi\u00f9 rispetto ai tanti ruoli \u2018alimentari\u2019 interpretati di puro mestiere in varie commedie degli ultimi anni, e anche gli altri attori sembrano condividere l\u2019atmosfera generale, con la spalla comica di Arkin che si fa preferire a quella sopra le righe di Hart, mentre Basinger \u2013 il cui personaggio \u00e8 nonna di un bimbo di otto anni \u2013 rende lustro ai miracoli della chirurgia estetica. Il regista Peter Segal mette in immagini il tutto senza voli pindarici, ma con una buona attenzione al ritmo e un\u2019inevitabile attenzione al citazionismo visivo: il risultato \u00e8 un onesto prodotto medio che si regge sul carisma dei suoi interpreti e che assolve al suo compito di divertire senza troppi retropensieri accompagnato da una simpatica colonna sonora d\u2019epoca (\u2018Back in black\u2019 degli AC/DC accompagna Razor sull\u2019ultimo ring). Da notare che i titoli di coda sono inframezzati da un paio di scenette conclusive (non al termine del rullo, perci\u00f2 non c\u2019\u00e8 da aspettare tanto): in una, Dante cerca di organizzare un nuovo incontro fra Tyson e Holyfield \u2013 li chiama per cognome per farli riconoscere, si suppone \u2013 prendendosi i suoi rischi."

      "text": "The actors from the 80s coming together mean it must be something great. There's no youth left in them for a concept like this, but the alteration of the story well suited for these fellows. As far I know Robert De Niro is not made for hardcore stunts, surprisingly he managed to give his best in this movie. And no need to praise Sylvester Stallone when it come to a movie based on boxing.\r The trailer was different that what I saw today in the movie. It totally misled me, I thought the movie was about computer game where two ex champions meet, but it went way beyond to the final battle. My eye was on De Niro, his entry in unfamiliar arena, the boxing. For Stallone it is like the return of Rocky Balboa.\r A little bit of fun and a little bit of drama. The story commenced with the early life of two rivalry boxers and moves all the way to the next 30 years. The uncomfortably settled life forces them to come together one final time and the rest of the story brief these legend's preparation for the grudge match. Recently saw plenty of movies based on old guys, but this movie is not that often you see. Well crafted movie, but only a just above the average, which mostly a time pass movie."

      "text": "Grudge Match is one of the most desperate ideas for a film I can recall. I've grown up watching and loving Sylvester Stallone & a Robert De Niro. And the 10 year old boy in me wanted Rocky Balboa vs Jake La Motta to be great. But realistically it's absolutely ridiculous. Ultimately this is a cringe worthy parody just trying to cash in on the former glory of two much loved and iconic characters. I love the Rocky films, but this is one boxing film too many for Sylvester Stallone. And it's embarrassing here to think Robert De Niro was once the Raging Bull. Alan Arkin is fun in a supporting role and I suppose for a glimmer of nostalgia that the fight is worth a watch once. But otherwise this is a tired and cheap gimmick."

      "text": "\"Grudge Match\" 10 Scale Rating: 4.5 (Mediocre) ...\r The Good: While the vast majority of them were in the previews, the film did have a couple of amusing scenes and lines. The idea and set up were solid and at least kept my interest enough to see it through to the end.\r The Bad: The dramatic elements miss the mark completely and I didn't really care about any of the subplots. The film is completely predictable and full of cliche scenes that we've seen in several other movies. While DeNiro was serviceable, Stallone was pretty much awful. Even Kevin Hart's comedy couldn't save this one."

Grudge match is more of a comedy than anyhting but it also has a story to it that is entertaining in its own right. If not a 7/10, it's at least a 6.5/10. People complaining that the main characters are too old must ont understand that that's the whole point of the movie. They're rivals from a long time ago and now, after retiring, they have to go back to training ot box one more time. It's not  worht a purchase but it's worth a watch."
