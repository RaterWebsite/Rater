Like \"Catch .44\" or \"Sushi Girl\", but even worse and much more incompetent.It was pathetic. Very painful experience. I've had a lot of spanish shame while watching."

      "text": "have i met you before..TerminalThe feature seeks attention through its visual aspects and the dark tone that is mysterious and intriguing, luring you into its besieged bubble which stinks \"street war\" from the first frame, but in a good way. The writing isn't as convoluted and smart as the writers think, which creates the vortex of loop that never outcomes in their favour. Also, the writers are so focused on the trajectory of the plot and its structure that it leaves the characters a bit undercooked that later raises questions rather justifying their actions. It fails on technical aspects too, like background score and production design which isn't convincing for a single frame. Vaughn Stein's attempt may be admirable on executing it, but it surely isn't effective as the drama and the emotions projected comes out shallow and redundant. Surprisingly, the performance; contrary to expectations, is lower as Margot Robbie seems arduous on her work where even though Simon Pegg and Mike Myers supports her; the bullet seems to have left the gun. Terminal is a passionate feature; that is unfortunately surpassed by talent, content and timing, which addition to that was on a mediocre level that never had enough crisp in the first place to ever make it past distinction, let along enter the major league."

      "text": "A new movie from Margot Robbie, unfortunately, did not live up to my unrealistic expectations. The climate of the neo noir and the dark atmosphere accompanying the whole intrigue, not only that it does not draw in its finale yet, is so strange and senseless that the secret and the growing tension are somewhere to escape. It's mainly Robbie, although there are a few very characteristic actors in the film. Sad."

The messy timeline and narration tries to make the movie more complicated than it actually is. What a boring, messy, useless movie. I don't understand what went through the director's mind. I think he wanted something edgy, with its own tone and identity, but the boring plot makes it fail miserably."

      "text": "I'm surprised at the heavily negative critical reviews for this. I admit this slightly campy, neo-noir isn't Shakespeare, but I was entertained.This is an interesting film involving an unseen criminal mastermind, a dying English teacher (Simon Pegg), two hitmen, a train station attendant (Michael Myers), and the quirky femme fatale (Margot Robbie) who has them all involved in her web of intrigue.Though the movie can be a little self-indulgent at times, I found it interesting. The dialogue is snappy and often darkly humorous, and everything comes together for the third act which has some effective twists and conclusion.I really liked the neon-lit, noiresque sets. They are the aspect that stands out the most. It's impressive what the director did with a smaller budget.Great cast. It's always interesting when Pegg tries a different type of role, this time as a well-spoken sad sack. Like usual, he really pulls it off. It's also great to see Michael Myers back in the movies after a several year absence. He provides a lot of levity as an oddball. Still, this is Margot Robbie's film. Though her English accent isn't perfect, she commands each scene with a playfully, wicked tone and smile. This is the kind of movie I recommend you see if you want to try something different."

It does feel like a bit of an amateur's take on a Tarantino movie, but each director is different and it surely doesn't make this worse. All the twists and turns kept me more interested than most of the movies i've seen recently and no way you could have guessed the ending.1 problem with this was it could have done with an extra 30 minutes just to extend a few scenes, just adding a bit more detail to some of the stories.Overall - I'd watch this again 7/10"

So if you like derivative films then you'll like, otherwise you'll criticize like most others here. The movie is unrated but I didn't see anything more than PG-13, and that's a further disappointment since Margot Robbie played a pole dancer at night and showed nothing, plus she's in short-order waitress wear most of the time, so further disappointment. The story itself is a double-cross revenger so no new ground broken there. Don't waste your \"movie night\" on this one, it's more one to play in the background while you're tablet-surfing or cleaning the living room."

Also the ending is somehow quite predictable even though it shouldn't be.

      "text": "Perhaps the cardinal sin being done here is that Terminal tries too hard to be like Tarantino. The film doesn't do much to make itself stand out amongst its peers, almost like its only reason to exist is to demonstrate some out-of-left-field plot twists that turn the movie on its head. Simon Pegg and Dexter Fletcher are the only real standouts, with Margot Robbie and Mike Myers phoning in uninspired performances. The only thing the film has going for it is a unique lighting setup that looks outright gorgeous at times. The oranges, blues, reds, and greens do well to complement the film's noir look, but that's the best that can be said."

      "text": "Terminal is a pretty peculiar movie, much because of his old school visuals and different atmosphere, some aspects that you don't normally see in movies these days. With a clear Noir environment this movies does put you into that investigation climate, that doesn't give you everything at the beginning and kind let you lost during a considerable part of the movie, and they give you piece to piece to try find out what is going on.The movie is about a revenge story. Two hit men, get into a mission commissioned by a mysterious person, and they meet Annie, wich have some to do with what is going on.I loved the movie cinematography, it remembered me a lot of Blade Runner, but without the futuristic aspect, the whole neon colors that jumped into your face is much well done. Sometimes the movie talks to us with their color, putting in the face of the characters some light that represents something, or putting they dressing as a color that also is having some meaning in what is happening.The acting was good for me, Margot Robbie is just amazing, she is interpreting with some over acting, some psycho lines and talking about death with a such natural and tormented way, the way she express and speaks worked a lot. Simon Pegg also did a good job, one of the best moments of the film is when his character and Margot character is taking a time to talk, talking madness. Mike Myers did an ok job, he didn't had much to do, but as an actor was very functional.The story did had some flops, somethings that i couldn't get along, they just have some ideas that doesn't feel right, some coincidenses that i don't buy, it does have multiple plot twists, some of them are really predictables, some aren't, but none get you like \"wooow\" wich i consider a problem, considering that it happens some many times. The movie doesn't make us feel that there is a world happening around, it doesn't have people living, it really doesn't feel like that is real, that got me off the movie sometimes. The sotry does have 2 nucleos, that are a little connected but actually aren't, that felt a little awkward, but was ok. And doesn't happen much things during the movie, it feels like you could watch the begninning and jump to the end.That is an ok movie to watch, you won't get any surprised while watching, but it is a ok story with nice interpretations."
