      "text": "Outing has atmospheric scares in every jump scene. The movie is low on gore because it is PG-13 but the movie didn't have to be rated R and gory to achieve its thrills. The acting isn't oscar worthy but that is because the movie features young actors who serve their purpose. The actors haven't starred in many movies but a thriller such as this doesn't require world renowned actors. There are enough jump scenes in this movie if you are into that in a horror movie. I thought I would enjoy this thriller and I did. I expected it to be creepier and more psychological than it is. The trailer lead me to believe that the movie would be creepier and gorier. I was disappointed overall with the movie but it is still worth a viewing. Ouija sends creepy vibes to the viewer and there are some neat tricks that the director used in the movie. The characters are lead astray and once they are tricked this leads to their demise. A decent thriller with some drawbacks but no flaws that impair the enjoyment of the movie."

What's the point, I can just sum it up right now. \"Ouija is a movie that doesn't try anything new and it is the worse horror film of this year and it's even worse than that other crappy horror movie called Annabelle\". But since I am a reviewer of movies, TV shows and games. It looks like I have to talk about it.\r The good things in this movie: Nothing good at all.\r Now for the bad things in this movie: Is this movie scary? no it is not, because this movie has nothing new and nothing to stand out, it just ends up being a water down horror film that doesn't take any risk. The acting in this movie was so bland and so dreadful, I see nursery kids act better then the people in this movie. The character's in this movie are so stupid and really uninteresting, and in every bad horror film there just to get killed off or fill out the screen time with their awful acting. The script, the directing and the way the movie is shot is so poorly done that I could have directed this movie better and more interesting.\r Overall Ouija is a water down horror film that only tries to scare you but the movie has I said before has nothing to live up to and that's way it fails hard."

For what Ouija lacks in originality, it makes up for with a flawless plot line and endless jump scares that had me clutching my friends throughout the entirety of this showpiece. Some of the best acting i've ever seen, particularly the protagonist Luigi whose acting left me anxious, terrified and curious to watch more - the emotions I simply can't explain. Many people critique the quality of acting in Ouija - it's clear that these people are ignorant, unable to grasp the complexity and skill required to perform such parts as Debbie whose entire group of best friends are slowly killed by Luigi\r Ouija isn't just a movie, it's an experience. I have no choice but to give this film a 10/10. The next time you're looking for a movie to watch, why not Ouija? You're missing out if you don't\r \"Good Bye!\""

Even though it is confusing and it has some good scares and accidental scares by the characters friends which is the main problem about this movie also the characters and their idiotic choices between playing with Ouija board. In 2012 White and Snowden wrote The Posession which was a mixed attention from critics despite that fact that they did NOT control the rains to make a horror movie Posession was not scary in Ouija they controlled it elements of scares Ouija tries and tries to be the bigger thrills to bet the scary movies to come out in the past like Insidious.\rWhite directed this horror project he did not make a formula of a perfect movie but he made a good script. Also acclaimed producer of (Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake , The Unborn , Amityville horror remake, Nightmare on Elm Street remake), Micheal Bay did not ruin this horror movie he didn't do anything at all but thanks to him this Ouija movie is getting negative reviews from critics."

The locations, the deaths, and the jump scares all give it a \"been there, done that\" vibe. It's not scary in the slightest. Every now and then a movie like this will at least be mindlessly entertaining, but that isn't the case here. You've seen all this movie has to offer before and it was way better then. This is definitely for the young and the dumb.\r I'm amazed at this movies ability to make the jump scare tactic even less effective. You know when, where, and how it's going to happen. You won't flinch in the slightest. There's no tension and thee is darn sure no fear. The ghosts look so unoriginal it's painful. This might be the least scary horror movie I have ever seen.\r The plot and acting are just as bad. Tension build up is nowhere to be found and everything plays out exactly how you would expect it to. It's painful watching these \"actors\" try to look sad and depressed at the death of one of their friends. It doesn't even use the Ouija board to good effect. It's just your generic haunted house crap.\r The only value it could have had was if you were a teen on a first date. Young, hormonal teens are the only ones who could have derived any enjoyment from this and that would only be from what came after the movie. However that only applies to when it was still in theatres. So what would be the point of watching it now? Maybe you want to try and scare your friends at a slumber party? All this would do is put everyone to sleep and ensure they never come back to your house for another one. Just avoid this crap. With no scares and entertainment value at all it isn't worth anyone's time.\r I give \"Ouija\" a 2.2/10."

On top of that, it relies on the same cliches that litter every other horror film  for the last decade and brings nothing new to the genre whatsoever. Now, I don't expect award-winning performances or complex characterization in a horror flick, but I do expect an attempt at mediocrity (or better, if I can get it) ... there was none of that in this film. A great story and script can overcome some very poor performances, but that was also missing. A half-hearted attempt all around."

I have never used it but some of my friends with a taste for these themes have used it or know it well enough to ensure that its not a good idea to use it. Here, in Portugal, its better known as \"Jogo do Copo\" (literally Game of the Glass, because the triangular pointer is often swapped for a glass cup that has to be broken after the game). Basically, my friends told me that any spirit or demon can answer the call and deceive the players, and the board is the source of several possessions or supernatural disturbances. I don't know if that's true, I'm telling what I've been told, but I will not pay to see if it's true or not. As the people use to say here, \"prudent man has died old and suspicious man is still alive\". But let's talk about the movie, that's what matters.The film begins with a good horror premise: an Ouija board that is at the origin of the mysterious death of a young woman. The problem is that the whole plot that develops later is of an awful predictability. In terms of scares, the film also fails roundly. Neither the usual sound and visual tricks were able to make me jump from the seat because I was able to foresee them. The tension, usually compulsory in a horror film, is so absent that it can make us fall asleep. The characters are empty, devoid of personality or some feature that makes us like them, and that makes it indifferent whether they live or die. Some are truly stupid and we just don't care about them. The cast is composed of actors with no talent or experience, who deliver wooden performances, unrealistic and without remarkable merit. Finally, its necessary to talk about CGI, visual and sound effects: although the movie is visually regular, the computer effects are very boring and low, probably because of the low budget."

Laine in particular appears less and less engaged and interested in the increasingly incredulous scenes. Maybe she took up the use of mind-numbing sedatives to blunt her increasingly desperate self questioning of \"Why oh why did I sign up for this joke of a film?!\" Well, the director and writers obviously didn't care about the film, so why should they? \"Is there a presence here?\" they ask the Ouija board, while trying their best exude as little presence as possible themselves, silently hoping that their low impact approach to acting will make them invisible enough, so that people will forget that they were ever associated with this crime against film. The characters have no individual characteristics to the point of being hollow. The dialogue is so shallow and unrealistic that it made me laugh out loud and never allowed me to get immersed into the story. A good film IMO has a solid story delivered by decent actors, and makes me forget that it's a film. Ouija with its repetitive, inconsistent plot twists, parades a sign of \"I AM A (BAD) FILM\" in every scene. It's as if the \"writers\" were following a bad screenplay guidebook, hell-bent on using every rookie technique ever invented. Characters state the obvious, they say things that sound unnatural just to reveal information to viewers in a vague attempt of back story and they are suddenly experts on certain things. Without any explanation, Laine is suddenly sure that \"Mother is angry\". When Laine and Debbies bf find pictures of the people who used to live in Debbie's house, Laine's bf stiffly proclaims: \"Judging by these pictures, they were taken in the late 40's, early 50's\". Lol, who talks like that?! Certainly not a leather jacket wearing teenage college student, who is apparently also illiterate, because he has to call Laine over to read aloud the article he found about these previous tenants (an article which of course was the first one he found immediately on typing the words into the search engine of his laptop). And mental granny offers no logical reason for her advice of cutting the stitches off DZ's mouth in order to drive away the evil spirit. The highlight of stupidity is when Debbie's spirit appears in the final spirit battle, complete with triumphant background violins.The trailer resorts to false advertising to trick punters into wasting their time and money on this children's film, which shouldn't be allowed to be categorized as horror. The good reviews here must be the result of paid affiliates and 12 year olds."
