The dastardly dozen invade the plush 30th floor offices of Nakatomi Corp during its Christmas party, and hold the employees hostage as a computer whiz cracks a code that will put the mainly German bad boys in possession of $600 million in negotiable bonds.\r Slipping out of the party in the nick of time with nothing but his handgun, Willis is the fly in the ointment of the criminals\u2019 plans, picking off one, then two more of the scouts sent on pest control missions.\r Beefed up considerably for his role, Willis is amiable enough in the opening stretch, but overdoes the grimacing and heavy emoting later on. The cooler and more humorous he is the better. Rickman has a giddy good time but sometimes goes over the top as the henchman."

It isn't one of the best films ever made but it is top of its class in its respective genre, which is good enough for me. Bruce Willis is a terrific hero but It's Hans Gruber (played by Alan Rickman) who is the standout character of the flick. He's simply everything you ever look for in an evil villain - and the accent only helps. If you're looking for a fantastic popcorn feature to enjoy then look no further."

      "text": "In spirit, this is the simple story of a man who saves Christmas; a kind of Santa Claus Conquers the Martians scenario, in which the greedy German terrorists are defeated by the noble and just bullets of Bruce Willis' MP5 - delivering the meaning of sharing and caring right into their heads. Of course, trying to define Die Hard as nothing more than a hollow-day (!) movie would be doing it a great disservice. The characterisation of both McLane and Gruber (or Grinch - a coincidence? You decide) is done superbly by their respective actors. They draw you in with their personalities so well, that you find yourself cheering both of them on, just to see them continue to snap at each other. It's like a bizarro buddy-cop routine that took the 'good cop, bad cop' play a little too seriously. It's not incidental that the characters themselves often refer to cowboys and Westerns - this is a veritable wild-west duel, taken at a number of vertical paces rather than a standard back-to-back reflex test. That being said, however, some of the best moments are when McLane is just talking to himself, cracking wise while in the middle of a seemingly impossible situation. You don't have to convince anyone that you're a badass when you've just jumped off an exploding rooftop, Roy. You could try and make a case for the ending being cheesy and unnecessarily joyous, or that there are many implausible moments, but that would just be ill-spirited pedantry. This is action at its finest, and you better take what Mr. McTiernan gives you. There's no CGI or giant robots flying around - just good old-fashioned action, and it quickly becomes very obvious that films these days are just plain old doing it wrong. So sit back and plug in for two hours; you'll be yippie-kai-yaying in no time. Written for: www.webbinghaus.tumblr.com"

So often action movies are considered the filth of filmdom, containing silly plotting, thin character work, and juvenile thrills that appeal to the most basic, reptilian parts of our brains. But, I say again, let it be known that John McTiernan's \"Die Hard\" is not only the quintessential action movie, but an absolutely, undeniably well-made and brilliant film altogether. The plotting is exquisitely done, featuring numerous plot threads that are well-thought-out, revolutionary to the genre, and -- most of all -- smile inducing to the umpteenth degree. The characters within these plots are also unquestionably fascinating, with personalities that offer so much to the stakes and the situation at hand. And the action is thrilling, yes, but also terrifying. There's so much of this movie where you're simply convinced something has to go wrong for John McClane, but you also feel that you can't help but watch and see what happens. It's like watching a double-digit run rally in the bottom of the ninth to tie and eventually win the game -- you can't believe you're seeing it happen, but you feel blessed for being there to witness it. \"Die Hard\" is the pinnacle of action movie filmmaking and one of the best motion pictures that the medium has had to offer us."

Like most of the film making ingredients used to make Die Hard the cinematography punches above its weight adding superior artistic merit to what could've easily turned out to be something more average. Tension (which kicks you in the face early on) builds nicely throughout the film. The story is punctuated by its memorable characters in particular Hans Gruber portrayed excellently by Alan Rickman. Willis establishes his action chops here and his movie career rose to stratospheric heights immediately after this. Lost count of the number of times I have seen Die Hard...Memorable cinematic shots stay with me long after watching this like the fall at the end. A classic action thriller that still holds its own."

Actually it is based on a book named \u201cNothing lasts Forever\u201d by Roderick Thorp. The book however is at least unknown in my country and I was as much surprised about it being a book adaptation as everyone else I asked about. What I read about lead me to the conclusion that they improved the story as the book had a downer ending. The story follows detective John McClane who travels to Los Angeles on Christmas Eve in hope to reconcile with his wife Holly. She is on a party held by her employer the Nakatomi Corporation in their tower building on their Nakatomi Plaza. Unbeknownst to them a group of armed men led by Hans Gruber are targeting the vaults of the building. This is the set up for the story. The story itself is well written, intense, thrilling and enjoyable. I especially like that the villain Hans Gruber is not a moron. He is clever and adapts his plans perfectly to the situation. A very hard to overcome antagonist for John McClane. Also John McClane is not depicted as standard unharmable action hero and this makes the movie more special. He is neither perfect nor invulnerable or flawless and this was refreshing. I clearly see how this become a cult classic. The actors are the other thing that made the movie so good. Lets start with Bruce Willis as John McClane. It is his first mayor role in a big movie and became as much his signature role as much as breakthrough (as action star). He fully delivers his role and character. However Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber is even better. Only a few villains left such an impact. He is routinely high up on top movie villains list of all times. An absolute flawless performances or so close I can not see a difference. These two work well. The rest of the cast also delivers and I want to praise Reginald VelJohnson, Bonnie Belinda and Alexander Godunov for their roles. Visually the movie is awesome too. Be it the sets, stunts and action scenes. Everyting is fitting. Also there are many memorable scenes and everyone knows the phrase \u201cYippee Ki Yay\u201d. The writing and dialogues are also well done for an action movie so I should praise of cause director John McTiernan and the two writers Jeb Staurd and Steven de Souza. The rest is history. It became a box office success, elevate both Willis and Rickman and became a cult classic atop on a different kind of Christmas movie. Overall this is a must see classic and I think this should be the final sentence in my review."

      "text": "This film began a remarkable action movie franchise that runs around the detective John McClane of the New York Police Department. In this film, he will try to save the life of a group of hostages held captive in a corporate skyscraper of Los Angeles. Directed by John McTiernan, the film has a script of Jeb Stuart and Steven E. de Souza. Bruce Willis embodies the leading role. The film was nominated for four Oscars (Best Sound, Best Editing, Best Sound Effects, Best Visual Effects).At first glance, this film does not look like anything special. Another eighties action movie, full of explosions, police cars made in pieces and bloodthirsty killers facing a single man, full of noble intentions. However, this film has something different: in a decade full of bullet proof heroes, this hero does not act (or looks) as something indestructible. He hurts himself, complains all the time and looks like a guy facing a situation beyond his control. So, its not difficult for the public to chear McClane, making Willis great performance the big advantage of the film.Everything else followed, more or less, the pattern of the decade for action: stunning sets, special, visual and sound effects made with great care and regular performances from the rest of the cast (the interpretation of Alan Rickman, then still little known by non- British public, deserves a positive note of attention). This is an action film that captivates some audiences more adverse to this kind of movies, which proved to be the key to its success."

      "text": "German terrorists, a skyscraper, Christmas Eve and LA. When these elements are combined, you get Die Hard, a 1988 rip-roaring action epic that shot Bruce Willis to international fame. The plot is delightfully simple; John McClane is a New York cop who is visiting his wife Holly in LA during Christmas Eve. He meets up with her at her business company's Christmas party. All goes well until a few uninvited guests in the form of creepy terrorists seize control of the building and take all 30 of the guests hostage, demanding a ransom. McClane, in the bathroom at their time of arrival, escapes into the unfinished skyscraper armed only with his standard issue 9mm at his disposal. His main objective; find out what the hell is going on. His only help is a flatfooted cop on the ground played by Reginald VelJohnson of Family Matters. Along the way, he is listening to radio messages between the villains with a stolen walkie talkie in an attempt to figure out their nefarious plan. Alan Rickman is great as Hans Gruber, leader of the baddies, and delivers a performance he echoes in the Harry Potter films as Prof. Severus Snape. One of the best movie villains of all time. This festival of explosions, guns and epic battles was directed by John McTiernan, famous already for the original Predator. He delivers a movie that entertains as well as it shocks. In particular, the sequence in which one of the hostages attempts to save his own life by offering McClane to the terrorists. Correctly anticipating a liar, Hans shoots him in the head. The film was one of the biggest box office hits of the 1980s and spawned three sequels throughout the 1990s and 2000s, firmly placing John McClane as an action hero alongside the Terminator and Rambo. Also, it is the best Christmas movie ever made."

It is sloppy, gritty, and wise-cracking. Bruce Willis opens out a stage all his own with his role as John McClane. A normal NYPD cop visiting his wife in LA runs into a problem when a some bloodthirsty thieves break into the Nakatomi building (Mrs. McClane's work building and headquarters of the entire company) Lead by German master mind Hans, they take over the building with dozens of hostages including John inside while they plan to steal the company's wealth. He's just one man. And he looks pretty ordinary, but he quickly proves to be a problem for the bad guys. Bloody shootouts, hard nosed fight scenes, and clever Willis commentary. Any person who likes action films has to respect what has been done here. Simple as that. Due to the excessive blood, gore, and swears, the score has to be a little low. I also felt some of the hand to hand and gun fights were a bit choppy and chaotic more so than they needed to be. The local chief of police also seemed pretty stupid. That was kind of the point, but I think they made him a little too stupid and ignorant. But don't get me wrong, this is one of the best action movies on record. John McClane is one of my all-time favorite action heroes. Takes the genre to new levels. Props."

The direction from John McTiernan is uninspired and he is practically invisible while his movie falls apart thanks to unrealistic sequences and being overlong. Honestly, this whole movie is pretty damn unrealistic. That being said, there are positives. Willis is charming, Alan Rickman is phenomenal, and the action is appropriately thrilling and largely well-directed. Those positives are enough for me to say Die Hard is middle of the road, but I do not really understand the acclaim."

Les m\u00e9chants terroristes (!?) sont des Allemands dont le chef cabotine comme un Teckel en col\u00e9re et l'escouade est compos\u00e9e d'Allemands bien blonds avec un gros accent : s\u00fbrement des Nazis d\u00e9guis\u00e9s...!Le sc\u00e9nar quant \u00e0 lui est \u00e0 peine suffisant pour remplir la feuille de route d'un nanar mal d\u00e9grossi et le film manque de rythme : il ne parvient en fait jamais \u00e0 le trouver et met un temps fou \u00e0 d\u00e9marrer. Ni dr\u00f4le, ni spectaculaire, ni fait ni \u00e0 faire, ce premier Die Hard est une daubasse ridicule du d\u00e9but \u00e0 la fin."
