During a monotonous 2 hours, the so called 'realism' is seen in his never ending battlefield where the U.S gets all the respect and bad-ass deaths with last line memorable quotes spurring out from their tongues. BUT. I still give credit for his decision to portray a battle lost by the US. I think it's one of the first non-bias-tried movies."

Supported by the US Army... No real critcism, no background information about the war that would allow a deeper questioning of the mission - thats not enough. This movie is not more than a show. The show as such is realistically done, but it's just as flat as its characters."

However, it all goes wrong and the chopper is shot down, leaving them stranded in the middle of a village with angry hostile soldiers and civilians. Other choppers are sent in for backup, and chaos breaks loose. Lot's of violence, blood and guts. Great characters, and played tremendously well by the actors. Black Hawk down is a great war movie. The plot is a bit basic and shaky, but it is a great movie nevertheless and one I recommend to any war movie fan."

No doubt that it gives the military industrial complex a permanent hard-on.It's not only littered with factual errors starting with the very first quote which is wrongly attributed.

If you look at the picture of the somali-citizens, all of them were showen as brainless, killing terrorists. One of many fault facts which were sold as truth in this movie. Because of showing only the chronology of battle scenes, without telling the whole story of this UN-mission, ths movie will not reach more than 3 points."

Il d\u00e9sature un peu de temps \u00e0 autre, abuse un peu des filtres mais il n'y a pas de quoi faire la fine bouche, c'est du beau boulot.La guerre des troufions est brutale et sanglante, voire carr\u00e9ment sanguinolente : c'est que les \"squelettes\" islamo-musulmans comme ils les appellent sont dix fois plus nombreux que les super-soldats du monde libre et qu'ils ont des lance-roquettes, les salopards. Forc\u00e9ment, \u00e7a fait des gros d\u00e9g\u00e2ts. Et en plus, Rambo n'\u00e9tait m\u00eame pas l\u00e0.Mais nos valeureux soldats (enfin, pas les n\u00f4tres mais les leurs, nous on s'est toujours pas remis de la d\u00e9b\u00e2cle de 1940) gueulent \"ouha\" et m\u00eame \u00e0 moiti\u00e9 morts, veulent toujours y retourner ; m\u00eame \u00e0 l'agonie, ils te font le salut au drapeau et tous leurs camarades sont pr\u00eats \u00e0 les op\u00e9rer \u00e0 coeur ouvert sans anesth\u00e9sie les mains dans le sang et les tripes jusqu'au cou ! si c'est pas des fils de Rambo, \u00e7a !Diablement efficaces en tout cas, de vraies machines \u00e0 tuer : 19 amerloques morts seulement contre 1000 squelettes annihil\u00e9s ! putain le ratio morts/frags mon gars ! je tire mon chapeau.La distribution est tr\u00e8s bien avec aucune t\u00eate d'affiche, que des seconds ou troisi\u00e8mes couteaux ; la musique grandiloquente et faussement humble de Hans Zimmer nous rappelle qu'ils ne sont pas des h\u00e9ros mais qu'ils le sont quand m\u00eame.Et nous, on rigole bien et on appr\u00e9cie les frags de l'Oncle Sam aussi bien rendus ici : c'est tr\u00e8s divertissant et incroyablement efficace.

But if you look through the absolute insanity that is a country at war with itself, you'll be given a glimpse at what it means for America to be the world superpower and what others see when good will is met with ruthless opposition.  Like Vietnam, this wasn't the United States' fight.  But when innocent lives are gratuitously slain in the show of power, earning the fear and submission of those underneath you, movies like Black Hawk Down can easily offer arguments to where politics are a hindrance when there's men and women across the world that are ready to come to the aid of those who cannot help themselves.

This movie demostrates the background of the civilian war in Somalia with a very realistic approach, showing how is the situation of many 3rd world countries and what kind of reality the U.S seals and the native people of this countries have to face daily. One of the weak spots of this film is that there is a lot of action and not much dialogue and story, it's a non stop action film, but it's anyway a good movie, but not an masterpiece."

I, however, knew about this particular battle before watching the movie gave me a new perspective on the battle. It was a very depressing and horrid event, but I am glad to say that this movie is very good and you can watch it free on Netflix now so why not watch it? Anyways, I can gladly say that movie has aged well and is still a pleasure to watch. I really do feel the emotions and hardship the troops went through. The key players in this are the U.S. Special Forces (160th SOAR, Delta Force, and the 75th Rangers) and Mohamed Farrah Aidid and his militia, who by the way, are blocking the food/medicine supplies as their weapon. So the US Special Forces are sent in after an attack on UN and Pakistani troops. The movie is all about the title \"Black Hawk Down\" for those of you who don't know a Black Hawk is a military helicopter. A helicopter crashes and ground troops and helicopters are reverted to go back to the crash site to get back the survivors and equipment. Anyways, now that you know the plot, the movie acts this out very well and I think the SFX were brilliant for their age. I also loved the cast of characters and their role in the movie, they all seem connected. I love military movies and documentaries, so this review may be a bit biased. BUT, compared to the other horrible military movies out there this is a must watch for anyone, really."
