Disney spawned three more movies simply on the echo of Captain Jack's personality.  And that's it.  For the last three movies are increasingly void of soul, plot, or sense whatsoever.  They're just a bunch of weird ideas spinning around a character who deserves better.  This one has mermaids.  Outside that fact, I'm not sure I will (or will want to) remember anything about it.

I mean there were'nt any battles at sea, like in the other pirate movies, when i think of pirates i think of awesome naval battles. This installment just didn't deliver.

The first 15 minutes of the movie made me excited with the potential of the journey to come but somehow it just felt flat. Ironically, the most exhausting part of On Stranger Tides are the sword fights, too many of them and I was longing for some good slow pace story-telling which are few and far in between. The movie seems rushed, it didn't take it's own time and tell the story that it wants to tell. Rob Marshall just wants to bombard the fans with all action sequences and explosions, which is what a summer movie is all about (I know..). But there was so much potential there for a better quality summer flick.

The cast is great, the script improved, the action is breathtaking, and the pacing better.

However after an exciting and an opening with great potential i'm afraid it was all downhill from there. Jack Sparrow is back this time however he is on a quest for the Fountain of Youth however he runs into an old flame in Angelica (Penelope Cruz) who entices Jack and ultimately he ends up onboard The Queen Anne's Revenge, the ruthless pirate Blackbeards (Ian McShane) ship as he himself is after the Fountain of Youth. And thats were there the problems begin. The characters just aren't as appealing and fail to connect with the audience like the previous characters did in the first three movies. Cruz is decent enough but when you look at how good Keira Knightley was theres no comparison. Ian McShane doesn't convince as a ruthless pirate or the  villain of the movie like Geoffrey Rush or Bill Nighy did as Barbossa and Davy Jones. The plot itself and more importantly has big issues. For the first time in a Pirates film I didn't really see the point of what was happening it just seemed irrelevant. Many criticisced how overly complicated At Worlds End plot was but this just felt very sub-par and as the film ran along it fell flat even the ending which was too predictable. Instead, it seems as though Rob Marshall has focused on delivering to much action scenes rather than focus on building the story or film or even try and get us interested in a character other than Jack Sparrow because after the 100th sword fight it becomes slightly tiresome. Thankfully for the film Johnny Depp still does the business as Sparrow and Geoffrey Rush is brilliant as Barbossa however they are treading finely as it seems even with Depp on top form the jokes are wearing thin and the Pirates franchise seems to becoming dull, predictable and stale. There will no doubt be another sequel however I hope for the sake of what was a great film franchise they have a large rethink in their approach and get the proper people in place who can bring freshness aboard a sinking ship!"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Pirates of the Caribbean 4 movie is a hilarious and very cool that Jerry Bruckheimer did not let down.

Anyway, Pirates 4 is a great movie for all to see."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "To be fair, I wanted to enjoy this movie, but what was received seemed less like a professional scripting of a film and more of an adaptation of some child's fan-fiction.The plot hardly seemed cannon and offered little consistency in the logic. How did an old man manage to be \"fished\" by two others? Why did Blackbeard need such a large crew for his ship when simply by pointing the ship would manage itself? Why did daylight only hurt the mermaid in the second half of that saga, when earlier the only issue was breathing in the tank? Why does everyone else just spontaneously begin to remember lore about the fountain?The movie delivers on some sequences where the famous \"theme\" works in action, but this is not the Pirates of the Caribbean you once knew. You care not for the parties involved, and could only care possibly about Jack in his hopping and meshing of allies and enemies, but even then in the end the viewer is confused as to why Jack seemed to not care about the fountain.Action? Yes. Plot? No. An extended version of the trailer is all you would need to see. This is the result when a stand alone film turns into a trilogy, then that trilogy gets a fourth installment. What's scary is that after the credits a possible fifth movie is implied, and that movie may be an absolute bomb.Just pretend this movie doesn't exist and think of PotC as a good trilogy."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "it was a great movie so fun! it was hilarious and was definitely worth it.if you haven't seen it you should. it was the best movie Ive seen this year."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Pirates 3 was truly the epitome of everything wrong with this franchise. It was long, it was confusing, it forced in comedy when it didn't need it, it tried to balance too much at once, and above all things, there were moments that were truly incredible. The worst thing in cinema is not a bad movie, but seeing a bad movie that clearly could have been a great movie. That was the frustration with Pirates 3. The movie had a giant maelstrom with two ships duking it out in a whirlpool, and there wasn't a good movie around it. Fortunately, Pirates 4 corrects the mistakes of the past. It's just the right length, it isn't confusing, the comedy doesn't feel (as) forced, and it fits in all it needs. What it's missing is anything to wow the audience. I didn't think it was possible, but this is one boring Pirates movie."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "What... the... hell. How is this even a pirates movie? Where's Will? Where's Elizabeth Swan?

This film is not the one I expected from the Pirates of the Caribbean saga. How can the story and the techniques of the films is so boring and monotone like that?!

The fact is, this movie has the lowest critics score of any in the series. The truth is, it may actually be the best one. The cast is great, lead by the always good Johnny Depp. I actually didn't care for Depp that much a few months ago, but he's starting to grow on me now. The action is occasionally confusing, but those scenes of underwhelment are made up for by some really good action set pieces. The direction is great, too. I thought that Rob Marshall, who previously did musicals, was a bit of an odd choice at first, but I honestly think that his work in Chicago helped with some of the action pieces. There is a love story in this one as well (not between Jack and Penelope Cruz, but rather a missionary and mermaid), and I have to say, this one was handled really well. I honestly cared about the realtionship between these two, which I can't say about Will and Elizabeth (getting married on a ship in the middle of a battle? REALLY?). Now, the story may be a bit convoluted, and the CGI in this isn't as good as the last installments, but that being said, I could still follow the story quite well, and I would rather have the CGI be the film's low point than have it be the only good thing (like in the last 2 Pirates films). If you want to se this movie, I say go right on ahead. If you're like me, you'll love it. IF not, than I'm sorry that I may have lead you to spend money on something you didn't like."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "The Pirates of the Caribbean movies have come along way since the first one came out, it was fun, mysterious and intriguing. Unfortunately for this newest addition to the Pirates universe it simply fails to deliver. There are three major drawbacks which dragged my personal rating for this move down to a 3.First of, they tried compressing a to big of a story into one movie. The story lacks coordination and transfers the viewer from location to location, from plot to plot, from character to character in to little time so that you will just not be able to tell what exactly is going on. You will have no emotional bond with any character or the stakes at hand. The overall story of this movie is just simply to big to be put into a few hours.  Second, the characters presented in this movie are just flat out bad. The leap in time between the previous movie and this one is just way to big to make you understand anything about any character involved in this movie. Jack is of course back, which is a pretty big drawback, considering he is actually the main character in this movie. In all the previous movies he is a fun and enjoyable character, BUT ONLY because he was WASN'T the main character. The entire movie now evolves around to many lame ass jokes and hes annoying personality, which was fun in the previous movies because hes personality was present in much smaller doses. Sparrow made the movie way to annoying and he's trickery and fighting action has become way to predictable because of it. Hector Barbossa suffered immensely from the huge time leap between this movie and the previous one. He pretty much resides with the Spaniards all the time, diminishing the characters value and time on screen, which is of course really a waste. Black beard also suffers from an obvious lack of time and story, he is just to big of a character. You will just not really get to know him as we got to know Davy Jones and Barbossa. He's daughter also suffers this drawback, although she is definitely not as interesting, which she could have been.Finally we get to see this sailor priest whom, I guess, needed to fill up the more serious and romantic role in this movie, but failed miserably. The love between a mermaid and this sailor could have certainly be more fleshed out. Yet again, it suffers because of lack of time and story.And last...3D fails, yet again. Clearly this movie lacked any of it. The occasional thrown dagger that gets a 3D makeover or scenery that looks as if it has a bit more 3D depth to it, but all in all it just simply lacks 3D. Conclusion: Very disappointed. It is way to obvious there was to much ambition (or lack of it) for this movie and it suffered heavily because of it."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "Congratulations Disney you officially ruined a perfectly good trilogy of movies. I'm glad the drive-in that i saw this movie at had this as a double feature with Cars 2, because if it hadn't and only showed this piece of **** i would have demanded my money back.  The only real reason why Penelope Cruz was in the movie, was for her good looks, which is a waste of a great talent.  If you're a director that plans to put add a female character for the sole purpose of looking good, put a good looking actress with no talent in there.  You'd save yourself a lot of money.  I want to know what on gods green earth the director was smoking when he thought it would be a brilliant idea to, not only have Captain Barbossa Captain a Royal Navy Ship, but emblazon the British flag in the background behind him.  I mean really, did the flag HAVE to be that big.  Captain Sparrow, who i agree is the flagship of the trilogy, and without him all four movies are pointless, not to say this one is just because he's in it, because it's the most pointless of all the movies, i commend Jack for being the captain that goes down with his ship (the trilogy).  The movie is missing two keys that would have made it a better sight to see.  Quite frankly the trilogy would be better off if this movie had never been made in the first place.   To put it even simpler, if i was given the option of watching this movie again or watching my **** go down the toilet, the choice would be easy... watch my **** go down the toilet, the horror ends quickly and dosen't drag on for two and a quarter hours."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "From the disjointed story, to the one-dimensional characters, this movie simply should not have been made.

Think Wolverine in X-men 1-2 vs. Wolverine in X-men 3 and \"Wolverine\". Shudder. The scriptwriter failed miserably at catching the essence of the first three movies in the franchise.Character dialogue is completely nonsensical. Just utterly, mind-numbingly pointless and stupid. This is a movie that just doesn't make any sense. From glass boxes as horribly glaring and stupid plot devices, to the villain vowing to kill off characters who are central to his plans, and generally, everyone is being a bit trigger happy concerning key figures without whom this entire enterprise would fall apart for all concerned.Kiera Knightley and Orlando Bloom have been outdone, Penelope Cruz and the priest are easily the most annoying characters I have seen, in any movie, for a very long time.Characters do things for no reason. Just pure **** insanity. Mermaids handing cups around randomly to save their captors and tormentors, people being sent out on errands to fix a bit of the plot off camera. I can't go on.

While not great, the two sequels at least attempted an air of \"epicness,\" for lack of a better term, with a grand mythological storyline and a bunch of subplots, which could have been annoying or interesting based on your opinion. They were entertaining, though partially exhausting, and were at least partially memorable. On the contrary, On Stranger Tides was not epic, or even magical, in its storyline or characters. There was nothing strange about it, and instead, the movie was everything you would expect of a money-grabbing attempt by Disney. The supposedly legendary Blackbeard was not nearly as fearsome as Barbosa in the first film, the plot was disjointed and uninteresting, and Jack Sparrow is becoming predictable.

That's what On Strange Tides is like. Flat coke. The plot is just one ridiculous scene after another, the characters are boring and have no development whatsoever, and there are so many loose ends you could probably weave a rug.

I would search for related news articles almost weekly, and each time anything was announced, I was excited about whatever news I'd heard. So you can imagine my excitement during the week leading up to the release of this movie. My expectations were insanely high, and I was confident that a new director and overhauled cast would provide the breath of fresh air or 'shot in the arm' that the franchise was in need of after the overblown, near-incomprehensible 'At World's End'.However, I must say that my hopes were somewhat lowered when I started reading some of the more negative reviews, and the dismal score that the film held on RottenTomatoes didn't do much to help this. Still, I remained positive and excited for this new installment into this series which I've loved from the very beginning. I was somewhat apprehensive, though; I thought that I was going to have to convince myself that I was enjoying the film - this was my fear. But it wasn't long into the film that this notion completely left my mind. The atmosphere and fun of the movie had taken over. The fast-paced opening to the film completely distracted me from all else; it was the same 'Pirates' action and excitement that drew me into the first two films (and the third, to a degree).But although the action was exciting and well-choreographed, it wasn't so much the action sequences that were the highlight of the film; but the humor. This film had some of the best witty banter & one-liners in the whole 'Pirates' series. And while Terry Rossio & Ted Elliott can be thanked for this, it was really the actors and their chemistry between them that brought the script alive. Depp was at his best, delivering both the dialogue as well as the physical persona of Jack Sparrow with the professional brilliance that we've come to expect from the man. Cruz played off of Depp perfectly, and vice-versa, as the characters of Jack and Angelica clashed in the most delightful way. McShane was perfect in his role of playing the genuinely evil villain of Blackbeard, whilst Rush was once again terrific in his role as the whimsical villain. Hollywood debutantes Sam Claflin and \u00c3"}, {"rating": "2", "text": "This movie was just a flat out mess. There was no pacing, characters didn't have a character, they had a name and a set of objectives that they had to do to advance the plot or cause something to happen that shouldn't have, but the producer thought would be exciting like having someone jump into the camera away from an explosion in a PIRATE MOVIE, or have a chase scene in a busy town that people should be barely able to move in (which is actually how the chase ends, why there is suddenly a huge path available before that who knows) riding a wooden cart full of flaming coals which for some reason isn't completely burning. I'm going to stop listing out things now or else I'll just be writing a summary of the entire movie. Captain Sparrow's character arc is starting to remind me of Stewie Griffens arc too. At the start of the series, he was an evil mastermind with gay tendancies, but a fun and original character. Now he is just gay. All of the interest, sublty, and roundness to the character is gone. Every other character is completely flat and only act to advance the plot in the way that the writers, or maybe the producer, wanted. They have no personality, no depth, no soul. They are not characters they are just living mcguffins. Nearly every big event in the movie just happens. It is not explained or even hinted at in any way of the sort why or how it was happening. There wasn't even a reason why or how the characters knew what they were doing. Even in simple little dialogue interactions, characters had responses that made no sense. As I'm looking back at the movie now, I can confidently say that if you picked out ANY scene in the movie, I could tell you at least 3 things wrong with it. I sincerely hope the writers of this movie never do so again. At the 30 minute mark I was already ready to walk out, but stayed because I did enjoy the other 3 movies. In 2 and 3 they had a few boring segments which turned to great ones later on, I kept hoping this would be the case but it sure as hell was not. The only reason I can see that this is getting positive reviews at all is either that a) these people are from disney or were paid off or b) throwing big name celebrities into a movie really will make people like it whether it is a good movie or not."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "As a huge fan of the previous 3 pirates movies, I had high hopes for the 4th movie.

Don't bring your young children along to it. Pirates of the Carribean was never really for simple minds to understand. I am not saying it has a complicated story, but much like the others, you have to pay attention to the dialogue, not just the pretty colours. There is definitely enough action in the film as well as a tiny bit of romance, but no more than you'd expect of Jack. On that note, the mermaids were great to watch as were most of the added special effects. Like all the Pirates of the Caribbean movies the effects are believable and that is all that matters, it doesn't need to pop right out into your face. That was the downside with this film. The director seemed a bit too aware that it was a 3D film and may have changed a few things because of that, that just didn't need to be changed. Overall, it is an awesome film.

In this movie its the same formula as the original but its all put up just to make a movie.  The characters have no depth despite them trying to create fake depth.  It seems like any summer movie put out to make a few million dollars."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Disappointing cast , senseless story , monotonous setting and 3D???? ....  officially the worst movie of the summer ... from the short dweeb with the magical sword to the lousy jerk with the wooden leg the movie stinks of under developed characters, lousy script and powderpuff makeup (u can barely look at barbossa) .... Depp's character was significantly overused and got really boring amidst occasional sparks with Penelope Cruz .... all in all watching this movie will probably give u the \"wtf was that all about\" feeling..."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "EVERYTHING Johnny Depp (Captain Jack Sparrow) did was wonderful & hilarious. Captain Jack Sparrow was aready sooo exciting that I didn't seem to care if they went into dept about the Mermaid Myth or any other characters' story. Sure, a lot of things in the movie were overly-exaggerated (like a man jumping over the boat after hearing about man-eating mermaids) BUT it was funny. I mean,  everyone already knows from the other series that you cant take someone like Jack Sparrow seriously so nobody should've expected a serious pirate story."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Saw this movie with my wife and teenage daughter at the local cinema.Great story, brilliant acting, and wonderful movie. Although there were a few scenes where the story seemed to drag on a bit. But all in all a very good movie."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I don't know why anyone would say this is a bad movie. Johnny Depp is hilarious, yet awesome, in every Pirates of the Caribbean movie and that is something you cannot disagree with. I have to admit that when I first went to see the movie, I had heard from my friends it sucks and etc. But when I got to see it by myself, I was happy. That's what I felt. I was happy to see that they made a new Pirates of the Caribbean movie, and I'm gladly looking forward to the upcoming fifth and sixth movies."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "I'm one of fans of this series who has enjoyed all 3 of the previous films, even the overly convoluted At World's End.  But still, I knew that this franchise was in need of a reboot or better yet, a trip back to it's roots.  I think it pulls both off really well.  Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow will never get stale, and he's in fine form yet again in this installment.  Ian McShane as Blackbeard also did an amazing job!   There's nothing better than an epic movie with equally epic acting and setting.  The new additions combined with the nods back to the past 3 movies blended together amazingly well.  Lots of good cameo appearances that I thought added to the story and were not thrown in just for fan service.  All in all, I have to say this chapter ranks up there as one of the best in the series.  I was not disappointed!"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Although not as good as the original pirates of the Caribbean movie. It is much better than number 3, if you are looking for good entrainment this fits the bill."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "It's simple.  If you're a fan of this series then you will enjoy this movie.  If you didn't like the earlier ones then you won't like this one either, as it doesn't really bring anything new.  The action is stale and very \"Disney\" which hurts the movie.  This won't be winning any awards but still I enjoyed it."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I am drawn to Jack Sparrow stories like sailors are drawn to mermaids... The franchise brings out the same kind of feelings I felt when going to the movies as a kid.  Penelope is a good addition to the team, however I did miss the chemistry between Sparrow and Will Turner."}], "recommendations": ["pirates_of_the_caribbean_dead_men_tell_no_tales", "terminator_genisys", "riddick", "poseidon", "shazam_fury_of_the_gods", "kingsman_the_golden_circle", "avengers_age_of_ultron", "maze_runner_the_scorch_trials", "the_many_saints_of_newark", "i_am_number_four", "hancock", "max_steel", "jumper", "bumblebee", "the_last_witch_hunter", "now_you_see_me_2", "the_a_team", "incredibles_2", "edge_of_tomorrow", "hercules", "the_twilight_saga_breaking_dawn_part_2", "transformers_dark_of_the_moon", "the_mummy_tomb_of_the_dragon_emperor", "percy_jackson_sea_of_monsters", "teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles"]}
