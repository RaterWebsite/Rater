I can't recommend it enough for fans of good horror movies."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "A solid adaptation, albeit with a bit too much alpaca-based comedyWritten and directed by Richard Stanley (his first film in 25 years), Colour Out of Space is a modernised adaptation of H.P. Lovecraft's 1927 short story, and takes a good stab at depicting one of Lovecraft's most oblique entities. Mixing humour and body horror (perhaps weighed a little too much towards humour), the film gives Nicolas Cage another opportunity to go full-Cage after he recently cut loose in Mom and Dad (2017) and Mandy (2018). And boy does he lean into it \u2013 this is the most ludicrous, histrionic, and borderline farcical performance since Vampire's Kiss (1989).Just outside the city of Arkham, MA (the fictitious setting of many Lovecraftian stories), Nathan Gardner (Cage), his wife Theresa (Joely Richardson), and their children Benny (Brendan Meyer), Lavinia (Madeleine Arthur), and Jack (Julian Hilliard) have moved into Nathan's deceased father's property, with Nathan embracing rural life by raising alpacas. On an otherwise normal night, the sky fills with pulsating light and a meteorite crashes onto the Gardners' land, and as time passes, amidst a series of ever-more bizarre events, the family members soon begin to show signs of unnatural change.Where Stanley is perhaps most successful in adapting the original is in terms of how he depicts the entity itself, or rather, how he doesn't. In the original story, the entity is described only by analogy, and even then, only in relation to colour. With this in mind, Stanley wisely keeps everything as vague as possible \u2013 vibrant, modulating pulses of light that seem to be emanating from somewhere just outside the frame, vaguely-defined spatial distortions, colour manipulations with no obvious source.Important here is the actual colour itself. Instead of attempting to create an indescribable colour (in the story the colour is beyond the visible spectrum), director of photography Steve Annis avoids depicting any one stable colour \u2013 every time we see the effects of the meteorite, the hue is in a state of flux, so although we can say the colours are recognisable, they are never identifiable as a specific colour, which was a smart choice on his part.As we get into the third act, the film abandons all sense of restraint as the body horror which has threatened to break through from the earliest moments is finally unleashed, foregrounding the exceptional work of special effects supervisor/creature designer Dan Martin. These scenes are heavily indebted to Chris Walas's work on David Cronenberg's The Fly (1986) and Rob Bottin's work on John Carpenter's The Thing (1982), including a direct visual quote of one of its most famous dog-related moments. Some of the more grotesque human-related effects also reminded me a little of Screaming Mad George's work on Society (1989).It's also in the last act where Cage is turned loose, and that's not entirely a good thing. Full-Cage has been seen in films such as Vampire's Kiss, Face/Off, Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call \u2013 New Orleans, Mom and Dad, and Mandy, but each performance has felt fairly organic, never becoming self-conscious. In Colour, however, Cage crosses into self-parody, with his performance having as much to do with people's preconceived notions of a Nicolas Cage performance as it does with finding the character; oftentimes, it feels less like he's trying to convey the character's emotions, and more like he's winking at the audience.Which might be entertaining and all, but which doesn't serve the film especially well. For all its insanity, this is a relatively serious movie, but Cage's performance is so manic, that it affects everything around it. For example, after a meltdown about his alpacas (\"don't you know how expensive those alpacas were\"), which just about fits in what we know of the character, as Nathan is walking away, he stops, turns, pauses, shouts \"ALPACAS\", pauses again, and then walks away. Undoubtedly funny. But does self-reflexive humour by the leading man help tell the story or even create the right tone? No, not in the slightest.The other characters all have a kind of internal logic to their crumbling sanity; the meteorite affects each of them differently, with their minds disintegrating in different, but consistent ways. With Cage, however, Stanley seems unwilling, or unable, to establish the parameters by which Nathan's mind is disintegrating, seemingly going for laughs rather than something more cogent.This issue notwithstanding, I enjoyed Colour Out of Space a great deal. Stanley's return to the director's chair is to be admired for its restraint and how faithful it remains to the very tricky Lovecraftian original. The body-horror in the film's will appeal to fans of the grotesque, whilst others will take pleasure from Cage's insanity, as narratively unjustified as it is. The film is ridiculous on many levels, but it's extremely well realised and well made."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "A phenomenal feat of film making.

There are slashers where characters run for their lives while someone is chasing them, and always somehow catches up to them just by casually walking. There are zombie apocalypse movies where every major conflict either begins or ends with a random spawn of a zombie horde right behind the main characters. In sci-fi genre, there are often the worst possible plots, which in some terrifying way infected the whole film industry in general - revealing five minutes before the ending that everything that happened had just been in someone's head from the very beginning, which leaves you in a not very ideal state of mind since you've just spent 2 hours living a lie.Then... There are Lovecraftian brain deforming space clusterf*cks where things just happen, and you have to deal with it however your brain is fit to process it, because nobody will help you understand anything. Definitely not anyone in the film itself, no narrators there, and don't even try asking the person who's watching it with you. You can be sure they have no idea, and if by some miracle they do, it still won't be an idea of any worth to anyone at the moment.That being said, it's also the source of all the originality, which makes every single bit of Lovecraftian lore a pure sci-fi gold, which is something everyone has to appreciate. Who doesn't appreciate that doesn't appreciate originality, and should just go watch some Fast & Furious XVII after a few rounds of their worthless League of Legend competitive match that they lost, so they rage quit to some PvE in Fortnite, because their lingering frustration won't allow them to play PvP at this self-loathing, absolutely useless moment of their lives.OK, back to the film itself.Someone might wonder about the title I gave this review, provided they managed to read the whole thing and didn't get offended by me criticizing their favorite series and games of all time. The reason behind it is the characters' utmost denial of totally everything that doesn't correlate with all the norms of their boring everyday lives. At first, it seriously annoyed me, but in the end, it made me look at it from a different angle, changing that frustration in the process into entertainment.(Just like being pissed off on a bus that suddenly stopped for 2 hours, but after those two hours you stop being pissed off, and start being entertained by seeing other people in absolute despair constantly checking watches and phones not being able to do anything to get in time where they should've already been for two long hours).Seeing Nic Cage in a good film is a rare and kinda weird thing in 2020. However, seeing Nic Cage not entirely believing that something is wrong when his wife has just been barbecued by pink energy from space that led to her merging with their son who's head is now growing out of her back making sounds that can't possibly mean anything else then \"kill me\", and comforting her that everything is going to be okay while she's slowly transforming into some Cthulhu on their sofa...

It premiered at TIFF last year but had a brief wide release this year. Lovecraft movies are very hit or miss. Aside from the films of Stuart Gordon, like Re-Animator and From Beyond, no one has really succeeded in making a really good one. His stuff is hard to adapt because a lot of it is short, not easy to adapt into a feature. Also, a lot of the imagery in his stories is intentionally impossible to visualize. That, and his stuff has tons of casual racism in it, even for the time it was written. Color Out of Space is one of the better Lovecraft adaptations out there. It updates the story to a modern setting and it adapts one of his least racist stories, like Stuart Gordon did with Re-Animator. However, unlike Re-Animator, I don\u2019t think this movie will be remembered as a classic. The acting isn\u2019t that great, with the exception of a good old crazy performance from Nicolas Cage. The effects are well-done, it\u2019s bloody and intense and of course it\u2019s very colourful, but overall there just isn\u2019t really much that\u2019s memorable or stand-out about it. It\u2019s a solid horror movie, but that\u2019s about it. I hear the director wants to do other Lovecraft adaptations like The Dunwich Horror and I think that\u2019s great. The movie actually kind of sets up a possible Lovecraft cinematic universe that could be worth exploring and I will gladly watch out for, but I still don\u2019t think this movie is the masterpiece that Lovecraft fans have been waiting for. While I don\u2019t think it\u2019s great and I don\u2019t think people will be watching this movie over and over again like Re-Animator, I think this is still worth checking out for horror and sci-fi fans, especially Lovecraft fans."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Nice to see Nic Cage do a good movie nowdays.

People are too valuable to the be target of grotesque body dismorphia as entertainment."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This is Annihilation on steroids and reimagined as a wild Nicolas Cage flick. There are so many comparisons one can draw between this and Alex Garland's sophomore outing (as well as the excellent book it's based on) that it honestly feels like a prequel about the arrival of that story's extraterrestrial visitor and what it was like when it first began creating \"Area X.\"Both films carry very similar imagery, offering alien transformations of everyday sights. The difference between Lovecraft and VanderMeer is also subtly communicated in these same visuals however, through the actual appearances of the changes themselves. In Annihilation for example, each mutation that can be found in the environment and its inhabitants has the look and therefore the feeling of nature rising up to reclaim its lost world. Here however, every metamorphosis is something your eyes immediately pick up on as being a deadly perversion brought on by an otherworldly entity. Oh, and the color palette is decidedly more neon as well.Another distinguishing aspect is how the plots approach similar concepts from significantly different perspectives. Rather than following a cast of characters with backgrounds in the various sciences as they witness the strange new surroundings after they have already come into being, Color takes an average family who already weren't the most normal bunch to begin with (we are introduced in the opening to the daughter practicing witchcraft out in the woods) and places them at ground zero where they witness the horrors blossom around them before their very eyes. So instead of watching only the physical forms of each protagonist change or adapt to fit the twisted landscape they willingly venture into, we get to see their minds, bodies, and home warp all at once in a disturbing orgy of the surreal and horrifying that they totally didn't consent to.Yet, for all of its grotesque and stunningly realized body horror there's a tone of playfulness running throughout the whole thing. It's clear that director and co-writer Richard Stanley wants us to laugh and shudder at the things happening to this unfortunate family, which makes some of the more ridiculous elements and Nic Cage's patented freakouts (one or two of which rank among his best) easier to swallow. In fact in regards to the latter, the qualities Cage is so often derided and mocked for are used in an appropriate manner that actually elevates the overall experience and with a knowing wink to the audience that view his schlocky projects solely for them in the process.The only thing that didn't sit well with me about the movie is that I feel it underdelivered on a defining staple of Lovacraftian fiction. That being how knowledge is harmful and that discovering the true nature of reality or coming face-to-face with something that exists outside our perception of it will cause one to lose their mind. Here though the entity seemingly robs everyone of their sanity before they're even aware of its presence at all. I guess I wanted more of a slow descent into madness as the result of an attempt to understand what's going on, rather than a force in the shadows messing with people's heads long before it begins to step into the light.The unasked question at the back of everyone's brain of what it would be like if a Syfy original actually lived up to its potential and managed to be good without entirely ditching the wackiness has finally been answered. Never before have disgust, bizarreness, and nervous amusement come together so delightfully. What's really impressive though is that Nicolas Cage got to step into one of those more out-there roles he seems to love while still being in a piece of quality filmmaking.

When I heard they where filming an adaption of my favorite Lovecraft story I was exhilarated it was going to be directed by Richard Stanley I was even more so. I was disappointed when it didn't premiere at any theaters in my state I waited till it released on blu-ray a month later. I was shocked that someone mostly translated Lovecraft well more or less on the sliver screen. The film has pacing flaws, crappy cgi, overacting at points (makes logically sense for people going insane) not following the story. This film isn't going to win any awards, it's not going be a film for everyone for Lovecraftian fans this will be a cosmic treat. final verdict 7/10"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Nicolas Cage has an alpaca farm, colour comes from space (literally) and starts mutating the animals, people and a hydrologist, of all people, tries to help."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Really really well made film.

The actors are (in my opinion) really good and let the viewer be fully immersed. Probably due to a limited budget the alpaca monster seems to be a puppet but it is really good and visually impressive. However I found it a lot more convincing than the mom monster that  looks a bit unrealistic to me, probably because it uses CGI. What really stood out to me is how they used color, portraying a color human beings don't know about seems impossible but they somehow pulled it off. The strange shade of purple they used in the movie really conveys this idea of a color put of space. It's not a masterpiece but it's a pretty good adaptation of a Lovecraft book and that's truly impressive."}], "recommendations": ["the_fly", "signs", "us", "sunshine", "the_invisible_man", "a_quiet_place", "the_ritual", "it", "event_horizon", "the_conjuring_the_devil_made_me_do_it", "annabelle_comes_home", "valerian_and_the_city_of_a_thousand_planets", "the_invasion", "annihilation", "a_cure_for_wellness", "a_quiet_place_part_ii", "cube", "coherence", "scary_stories_to_tell_in_the_dark", "it_follows", "the_green_knight", "the_conjuring_2", "ouija_origin_of_evil", "blade_runner_2049", "reminiscence"]}
