It's stupid, nonsensical, and unnecessarily vulgar. All things I'm usually okay with provided the movie is funny. Baywatch just isn't really. The movie at it's best when it's reveling in it's own absurdity. Something it isn't able to do all that much of as it never gets as goofy or over-the-top as it needs to. The majority of jokes here are of the same variety you'll find in any other modern R-rated comedy these days. The difference is here they feel flatly delivered despite Efron and Johnson giving it their all. There are a few chuckles, but not enough to make this stand out from the pack.The plot is a whole bunch of nothing. It makes no sense, but to be honest it didn't really need to. It just needed to give it's cast reason to do a bunch of stupid stuff. It serves that purpose and not much else. The sense of self-awareness Baywatch has about itself feels underserved. You can't really be in on your own ridiculousness when you aren't that ridiculous after all. When it isn't cracking lame jokes or moving it's bland plot forward with some really boring investgations, the film is all about glorifying beautiful bodies. There's some eye candy here for both the guys and the gals. It's ultimately not a very sexy movie, but if you're really young to the point where you really shouldn't be watching this in the first place, then there might be some excitement here. The rest of us will just sort of not really care.Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron are just as likable as ever. The movie? Not so much. It never gets as silly as it needed to be. The results are pretty bland as a result. There are plenty of better comedies out there that play more to the strengths of the two leads. I mean Baywatch isn't exactly awful, but it's not good either. If you want to see sexy bodies and hear some dick jokes there are plenty of better alternatives out there that will give you your fix.

My main complaint with this was that I felt like it was trying too hard to be like 21 Jump Street with Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum but lacked the heart and the comedy to even compare to those movies. I pondered why this movie was even made and what compelled The Rock and Zack Efron to even waste their talents on such garbage."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This movie brings the cliche plot from the series, as their original actors. The film has no commitment to be serious, having a good mood used in the films 21 Jump Street and Deadpool, which pleased me a lot. What bothers me most and what bothers in each group movie is that one member was not as important as the others. If it's a team movie, everyone should have a good time and importance, right? The villain is a good actress, but for the film, I found it a bit weak, and could have a lot more potential.To conclude, the movie is a reason for you to go to a movie theater with friends and have a good laugh and not see it with the intention of analyzing it as if they were Angels and Demons or The Journey, since it was made to fun.

Then it was too sexy, that I was not allowed to watch. The world has changed so much all these years. I always wanted to see that, but never had a chance. Now a film, possibly a new franchise if it all goes well. There were lots of expectations on it, but the film did not deliver that. Yet they have already announced a sequel.The bay security team is now recruiting new members. Three joins as the trainee after the tryout. Within a few days, a couple of suspicious deaths happen in the bay. The cops are not worried to solve it, but the Baywatch team jumps in and starts their own investigation. That leads them to a dangerous territory. From there, how they deal with it was revealed with some action-thriller.Pumped up body, starring alongside a current top star, nothing is working for Zac Efron. He's just an accidental actor, won't survive long, unless he turns it all his way like Ben Afflect did. On the other hand, Dwayne was awesome. All the other actors too. Priyanka was not ideal for such role. Because an Indian in a negative role for an American film, nah, it does not work. India keeps all the thugs and sends only engineers, doctors, scientist et cetera to the foreign lands. A Chinese or a Russian villain works better.No suspense. Everything was open from the beginning itself. Some of the comedies were good, but some were most absurd. Especially, I did not like the storyline. The Bay security force not doing their job, but police work. It goes completely out of the frame. It's okay doing same within their enclosure, but the film entered beyond that. Thus, the film missed to cover the beach events as what the title had promised. I hope the sequel would fall in line.3/10"}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Baywatch is not quite as bad as most reviewers say.

Is that a mandatory quota to fill in Hollywood comedies nowadays? Our good friend The Rock also made it quite clear that only the best of the best were eligible to join the Baywatch team - not even Olympic gold medal swimmers are good enough, unless they prove themselves.Which is why this elite team proceeded to hire more weak females, that could not pull a drowning pet turtle out of an aquarium, and an overweight guy, whose only talent was getting boners in front of crowds, because \"he has heart.\"Now, I don't know about you, but I'd just love to drown knowing that the man who was in charge of helping me had so much heart, he died of a heart attack when attempting to reach the water.Personally, I'm not a Baywatch fan, but the entire premise of this film is so inconsistent with the source material, let alone its own claims, that I couldn't just sit back and enjoy it.In summary, utterly mediocre, and still somehow manages to insult the viewer at the same time."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "At beginning, Baywatch is silly but funny.

The main promoter and only beneficiary of real fame thanks to the show\u2014relegating, of course, the sexual symbol in which Pamela Anderson became\u2014, was David Hasselhoff, who created a ridiculous and superfluous succession of feature films and spin-offs in order to keep afloat a TV series that since its beginnings were buried in the mess of simplicity and silliness. A few years later, definitive cessation of audiovisual products on the lifeguard group was declared, however, the satisfaction did not last forever by informing, shortly thereafter, that a powerful Hollywood producer would take to the big screen the underworld of the bay with much younger faces, muscles, and buttocks. It is today when it premieres its homonymous cinematographic idea, a kind of hybrid between 21st- century comical vices and analogies of vacuous modern blockbusters of the forebear decade.Having as a main culprit the inordinate budget Paramount Pictures bestowed director Seth Gordon\u2014I don't understand why, but it was really surprising to me watching Andy Garcia and Eli Roth as producers on screen\u2014, the film manages to leave, momentarily, the superficiality of robust, suntanned and perfect bodies to tell a joke of criminal story about drug trafficking, which employs a spoof of contemporary action movies while trying to keep a bearable aura by comical gags (moderately funny), ending in a high-calorie recipe, the equivalent of a super comedy production brought to disappointing levels. At present, there are noteworthy works which were released on similar dates and that had the same tone, the difference is that they had solid ideas from its origin, a quick and timely sample: \"Spy\" by Paul Feig.They are giving hints of the jolly and trivial tone from the very start, that will prevail in the story with Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson emerging victorious from the water with a bather in his arms and the film logo, with emphatic pride, as a backdrop, adding dolphins gambolling\u2014perhaps lacking oxygen among such megalomania\u2014out of the water. I must confess I felt an intense good foreboding in the kind of initial video clip, nevertheless, it fell apart as soon as I watched that the first two names in the opening credits are masculine, explicit significant that some actresses are merely eye- candy, in the same way, the detail of the dolphins provoked that, almost automatically, I took my hand to my head, a disappointing posture lasting at least the half of the extensive almost hundred and twenty minutes. It should be pointed out that this action had a brief lapse of laughter, but, they were so provisional, that I don't remember the causes.The storyline is as bad as if it were an episode of the series they forgot to transmit on TV. Matt Buchanan (Dwayne Johnson) and his pair of stunning workmates oversee a competition to find new and suitable members of the Emerald Bay life-saving squadron. In parallel, the corresponding subplot is unfolded about a network of criminals who use the beach as a camouflage for narcotics trafficking, with multimillionaire Victoria Leeds (Priyanka Chopra) as the key ringleader. The story honors its source by flaunting big men and voluptuous women in extra small bikinis stammering cheeky jokes.Neither inherent vis comica of \"The Rock\", Efron nor rising star Alexandra Daddario manages to consolidate an unambiguous definition for this work from the beginning, and although some of the humorous circumstances, especially those expressed graphically, are quite jolly and acerbic, the lax direction by Gordon, regrettable screenplay by Damian Shannon and Mark Swift, some word-for-word absurd special effects, raccord detectable mistakes, and the way in which ideas are let out, cause the film to finish as an adolescent, summer, rated-R film prospect with one of the most valued acting teams today, an enviable budget and an audiovisual result, fatally drowned."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "\"Baywatch\" was a regular movie, where his return was not so triumphant, the performances were regular, the plot a bit absurd, and it causes me more stupor that Zac Efron continues to star in comedy movies with rude jokes, but what saves are Cameos of the old characters, but by God, as Pam Anderson ruined, and more than invited her to that movie, it's a damn roll."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "I didn't want the show, so I went into this movie banking on The Rock and Zac Efron.  Not huge fans of either actor, but I've been fairly impressed with their comedies in the past.  I was really hoping the movie would turn out like 21 Jump Street, but it didn't even come close.  Overall The Rock and Zac Efron had pretty good chemistry together, but they definitely could have been utilized more.  Priyanka Chopra did a pretty good job as the villain, but outside of these things the movie was fairly awful.  The other characters in the movie were one dimensional and just felt more like props than anything else.  They didn't really spend any time going into their back stories except for quick one liners to justify a character's knowledge or deliver a bad joke.  Some of the scenes in the movie also seemed unnecessary or lacked content.  A good example from the trailer is the scene where Zac Efron is wearing the dress.  The scene starts, Mitch/The Rock makes fun of him, they find what they are looking for and then the scene ends.  No one stops to stare at him, nor does it result in them getting caught, all it did was stress that his character was stupid, which had been confirmed multiple times prior to that scene.  Scenes like this happened frequently throughout the movie.  A scene that appears to set up for something that will probably be hilarious and then nothing happens.  TL;DR Skip the movie.
