I feel like it was sold as a comedy but it defintely isn't. I'm not sure exactly how to describe the genre; perhaps a loveish story. The plot and acting were good. Only thing is that I somehow doubt people would act the way portrayed in the movie if the world was ending in 3 weeks (parties, radio still playing, all power still on, etc), so that takes away a little from the plot. Otherwise the movie is touching and sad at the same time which is an interesing combination of feelings."

      "text": "Friend is too timid, plays things too safely, and shows us why post-apocalyptic insurance policies have their drawbacks.\r If the world were to end in three weeks, how would you spend it?  Would you go to work to keep consistency?  Maybe spend time with family?  Seeking a Friend For The End of The World doesn't delve into that question too deeply, but instead lumbers rather weakly through a script that wants to be quirky/serious, yet never finds its rhythm and fails to convince audiences it's worth their time to bother.  An asteroid named Matilda is about to hit the Earth, and insurance salesman Dodge (Steve Carell, 40-Year Old Virgin) has just witnessed his wife leave him to indulge herself in the final days, literally getting out of the car and running off.  Dodge's boring life is immaculate and pristine, yet he's never taken the big chances, opting for safety and security in his job and marriage.  He meets the spirited 26-year-old neighbor Brit Penny (Keira Knightley, Pirates of The Caribbean series), who has just broken up with her boyfriend.  Her character seems peeled off from John Cusak's High Fidelity: a pot-smoking vinyl record collector and a headcase who suffers from hypersomnia (can't wake up once she starts sleeping), which is conveniently used as an eighth-inning plot point.  Dodge learns that his high school sweetheart Olivia is trying to reach out to him, and so with Penny in tow he sets out to find her.  There are some funny scenes along the way, including a couple of cameos and a journey to a local restaurant where everyone seems tripped out on drugs, serving unique combinations of dishes on the menu.  It's a funny scene, but we don't have time for laughing as the dower Dodge has to find his lost love.  Eventually, he mysteriously realizes that he must make a choice between Olivia and car-mate Penny, who he has fallen for along the way.  Like we didn't see that one coming - the couple's \"opposites attract\" exchange midway through arrives just in time set to address this seemingly large plot hole.  Dodge knows that Penny would like to see her family in London one last time, and so the two make a trip to see Dodge's father who left the family 25 years ago (cue cameo #2) but owns that plane to get Penny home.  These scenes with dad are fairly touching, but it's just a play for the end of the film with no real closure for son and father.  As the world comes to an end, audiences will no doubt debate the end of Friend, which I suppose is the point, but it won't make you feel any better to do so.\r Friend suffers from several avoidable but critical errors which ultimately ruin the film. Our improbable leads give off zero chemistry, with Carell arriving with nothing more than a mix of his characters from The Office and Crazy, Stupid, Love.  He's really a black hole, sucking all of Knightley's high energy and charm with his blank stares and boring comments about the world coming undone and the choices he's made. Director Lorene Scafaria, who makes her debut with Friend, can't seem to wake Carell out of his melancholy funk, leaving us to wonder if she should have chosen a more dynamic male who could play boring to Knightley's quirkiness.  But it's not the only thing that betrays Friend: the ending is so clearly established that our leads will fall in love from the First Act that it's simply a matter of how they will get there.  Granting the audience such clairvoyance is not a bad thing, so long as you keep them invested in the characters.  Sadly, this fails to happen, as there's not enough time in the 101-minute movie to form a real bond between Penny and Dodge, opting instead for the ease of falling in love because the world is ending rather than seeking a real partner to die with.  Friend also suffers from other storytelling snafus: minus a few riots, the world seems strangely low-key in preparing for the end, with people still mowing their lawns and trying to maintain order.  We're left with a montage of oddly low-key and emotionally peaceful events of happy people celebrating the end of the world as Carell limps his way through the script before settling on the girl next door.  Once that happens, these intended touching scenes merely come off as more uncomfortable than destined.  I didn't realize that the end of the world would be so soft, gentle, and boring; but Friend doesn't have the wherewithal to suggest more than that.  I have to admit that Scafaria shoots a nice scene and will probably go on to make good films, but she's not there yet as a writer, as Friend never finds its voice beyond the standard and silly WTF moments of a world about to end.  Friend betrays itself with an uneven story and the miscasting of Steve Carell.  The enormous possibilities which Scafaria has at her command become lost fairly early, turning funny quirk to dreary and to an ultimately unsatisfying conclusion."

      "text": "First and foremost; it should be mentioned that this is not a comedy. It has some comedic moments, but overall, it does not belong in that genre. The number one thing keeping it from that is it's overall sense of impending doom and Steve Carrell's character's reaction to the coming apocalypse. It's a very emotional film that most people won't appreciate because their expectations will be that it's a comedy. If you can get past that I think there's something to be liked. One complaint I have is with the ending. There was a point in the movie that was so amazing and so cumulative that I begged them in my mind to end it and they didn't. Instead, the movie went on for another 10 minutes and took a different direction. If it had ended earlier, I probably would have been more apt to give it a higher score."

      "text": "As several other users have noted, this is not a rom-com, but a true story of romance.  It takes some time to get there, but it's a moving film.  Interestingly, the end of the movie reminded me of the end of Melancholia, but it's not nearly as ponderous and heavy as the latter.  Steve Carell is terrific as usual in a very earnest role, and Knightly is a good casting choice.  There are a bunch of great comedians (Rob Cordry, Amy Schumer) that round out the cast effectively - especially during the free-for-all segments.  Finally, a quick note that T.J. Miller steals the show with his role as the host at a TJI Friday's type of restaurant that's still operating amidst the chaos.  He's consistently funny in every movie he's a part of (She's Out of My League, etc.) and deserves to be a lead."

What may frustrate some is that the film (though consistent throughout) does not reveal its intentions until the last third. It isn't a rom-com. It's a flat out romance. Although there are a lot of really funny comic flourishes, it isn't a comedy. What the screenplay portrays in superbly natural but affecting dialog is the growing intimacy of Dodge (hero) and Penny (heroine) in this horrific situation. Most of this is done in subtext, as the picture depicts the various reactions ordinary human beings have to the impending apocalypse. When the picture finally opens up and reveals that its subject all along has been the relationship of these two, the effect is tremendously moving. The final moments are emotionally satisfying to a degree that few love stories never achieve. I am totally at odds with the critics who found this cliched or trite - what the hell do you expect people to say to each other as the world ends?\r Knightly is excellent. Carrell is Oscarworthy. Her character is late 20's, early 30's. His is 40ish. The age discrepancy is not crazy, and in fact works fairly well in the movie. (She has energy, he has a little more wisdom, and is mildly protective.) The picture in my view is a masterpiece. Others will disagree, but you at least have reasons why those in the 'love' camp find the picture so endearing."

But in truth it is such and far beyond. This film walks one of those fine lines that require respect for drama, comedy and original thought. If you anticipate a comedy, it inhabits more than its moments of articulate as well as lower case laughter. If you admire drama, Mr. Carrel and Ms. Knightly combine to alter the consciousness of films such as 'Melancholia' and \"Tree of Life'. Only the Ewan McGregor prize \"Perfect Sense' comes close to capturing the essence of a humanity in its last breath. This motion picture does it all. Steve Carrel"

The funny thing is that the movie is trying to illustrate that all the little things that bother you in life don't matter in the end, that it's all about the people and things you love, that those are the things you'll remember at the end of it all. And the movie embodies that very idea oh so well by being itself a mixed bag, but just like life it's not the pesky problems that you remember at the end, it's the good times. For this reason \"Seeking a Friend for the End of the World\" gets exponentially better as time goes by after seeing it, such a beautiful movie."

Scott or the previous \"users\" as my critics of choice for the end of the world (though some would certainly qualify for the role of buzz-kill if I needed one.). This is a surprisingly sweet movie (an observation from someone who usually doesn't like \"sweet\" movies), and it is precisely the setting of this rather corny but affecting relationship element against the \"dark\" but never-taken-too-seriously background of the \"end of the world\" that makes it so effective. (Apparently some people were expecting \"Dinner with Schmucks\" while others wanted either \"On the Beach\" or  John Paul Sartre.) I don't usually like Steve Carell (too glib) and think that Keira Knightley is somewhat overrated. But here Carell's basic \"sweetness\" (that word again) and decency shine through his deadpan performance, and Knightley proves to be a surprisingly charming comedienne. (Sorry, I didn't see the Pirates of the Carribbean movies.) The script is admittedly uneven, but there are nevertheless some great moments (esp., the lame boyfriend, but also the cop who insists on giving the tickets despite the impending apocalypse and the employer asking the  few remaining employees who wants to be CFO). More importantly, it is the evolving (albeit not entirely believable--though Scott's \"copping a cuddle\" seems misanthropic in the extreme) relationship between the two opposite \"losers in love\" and the fact that, once again, the writer never takes herself too seriously (unlike, for example,  Lans von Trier) that makes the movie both likable and fairly touching."

No of course not, so yes its going to be dull, but what you have to do is watch the film with a heart and a brain and put yourself in the characters position. Thats exactly what i did and i enjoyed this film. It was a great plot, great acting, and a good overall feel to the film. Yes the ending is awfully predictable but what ending isn't predictable these days? Unless its a movie like Fight Club with a twist ending, but are we looking for such a thing in a romantic comedy? I think not. This was a very relaxing and enjoyable film filled with good and bad emotions. I give Seeking a Friend for the end of the world an 8/10. The only reason i don't give it a ten is because frankly i expected a little more comedy involved but it was still a great film, and a nice break from blockbuster action films that fill up the summers schedule."

Gentle playing from two engaging leads, some amusing touches, and the question we are all expected to ask (\"What should you do if you know the world is going to end next week?\") is satisfyingly answered: what you should do for the whole of your life.

      "text": "This is not a happy story, this film will in no way end happily. However that doesn't mean there isn't great humour, joy and warmth in this wonderfully crafted movie by first time director Lorene Scafaria. Seeking a Friend for the End of the World is the story of Dodge (Steve Carrell), a man living with regret that his life has had no meaning. This regret is magnified by the fact his wife has left him and he has possibly the worst friends ever. Oh and there's the fact the world is going to end in 3 weeks thanks to a giant asteroid. This puts Dodge in a reflective mood and he thinks of his past love and whether he can see her again. Meanwhile free spirited Penny (Keira Knightley) living underneath him is torn up over the fact she missed the last flight to England and will never see her family again. Through various hijinks the two collide and vow to help each other. It's an unusual film in that the premise is so incredibly depressing and upsetting but the result is down to earth, clever and heartwarming. The film handles some serious themes but never lets them overburden the film as a whole. The discussion of mortality in the film is incredibly moving as Dodge wishes he had made the most of his life but always knew he wouldn't live long where as Penny wants to live if only because she doesn't feel fulfilled. The most surprising thing about the film is that it dares to be risque and crude in its comedy while delivering a finished product that will touch even the most cynical of people. The supporting cast is extensive and there is not a weak link in the bunch, which includes Patton Oswalt and William Petersen to name but a few. However the film wouldn't work without its two leads and both Carrell and Knightley give career high performances, especially the latter who tones down her performance to match the characters quiet yet frantic nature. It's a film that will surprise and impress with every twist and encounter right up to its final conclusion which may or may not have you weeping like a baby."

Great structural gimmicks were created and then thrown away, marvelous supporting characters and plots were introduced and then discarded meaninglessly.

The movie is categorized and advertised as a comedy and while I will say I had a few laughs in the movie, I would not call it a comedy but more of a drama with tiny bits of comedy sprinkled here and there. Dodge soon meets Penny (Keira Knightley) one day while she is mourning over wasting her life with all the wrong men instead of more time with her family. Soon, a riot breaks out and causes these two new friends to flee their apartment building. Dodge is on a journey to meet his high school sweet heart or \u201cthe one that got away\u201d while Penny just wants to see her family once again.

      "text": "I absolutely loved this movie!!!!! The plot to some people who live under a rock might seem a bit crazy but to me is totally believeable.  The relationship(s) storyline ring absurdly true to me, for I know alot of people and have never married but dated/had relationships throughout my life.  I thought Steve's dramtic acting was far and above anything he's ever attempted thus far and...he sold me and I'm a definite hard-sell.  He's always been a superior comedic actor, normally stealing the movie(s) away from bigger named stars, but I've got to tell you, in this role as 'Dodge', he stole my heart with his talent in this film.  Keira has always been a superior dramatic actor and this time around completely sold the bubbly, ditzy, free-spirited 'Penny' who hides her heart very well right up to the end and then just allows herself the gift of freely opening herself up to love.  I was sobbing at the end of this 'little funny film', that ended up being placed on my top 15 best films of all time!  You've Gotta see this film for yourself...you'll be telling your friends, family and co-workers all about it at the office water-cooler next week!"

      "text": "Seeking a Friend for the End of the World is a cult classic waiting to happen. It has elements that look and feel like Garden State, Little Miss Sunshine, and other popular indie films that have premiered over the past ten years. Carell is the best he has been since the above mentioned Little Miss Sunshine, and Knightly is strangely perfect for her role. Don't walk into the film thinking it is going to be a romantic comedy because of the casting choices. This is a romance, an unorthodox romance, but a romance none the less. This film may not gain immediate acclaim, but as time passes it will grow in popularity. If you like romance Seeking a Friend for the End of the World is a must see."

      "text": "\"Seeking a Friend for the End of the World\" 10 Scale Rating: 7.0 (Good) ...\r The Good: Solid dark and sarcastic humor throughout, that wasn't overdone or over the top. Well acted with charming leads that you can't help but root for, despite the fact that they only have a few days left to live. Genuinely funny dialogue, with enough touching moments sprinkled in. Some parts of the end were a little uneven, but the final minutes were great.\r The Bad: Loses it's way for awhile in the middle. Some of what the doomed pair encounter on their trek across the country wasn't as interesting or as funny as it could have been. The tone shifts back and forth throughout the movie and is a little sloppy."

      "text": "This film seems very underrated.  It offers a lot.  It will make you laugh, make you cry, and even make you question what you are doing with your life.  This film doesn't hold the viewer's hand -- at times you have to give the effort to identify with the main character and try to understand him.  I find this very rewarding and the sometimes absurdity of the main character really adds to the humor.  For viewers who like films to spoon feed them everything, this will probably seem like a boring and confusing film.\r The love story that develops is just a tad week, but still believable -- after all, it is the end of the world and that has got to have some effect on the heartstrings.\r Kiera is lovely and charming but she does overact a bit.  Carrel is fantastic.\r Ending is great and the adventure that the two go on together is heaps of entertaining."

      "text": "Seeking A Friend For The End Of The World is brilliantly directed and has an unusual, untraditional and unpredictable structure, but suffers from an unfunny, unengaging first act. I didn't laugh during the entire movie. The acting just didn't feel real and i didn't really care that much about any of the characters. It definitely has its moments though, and i'm going to give Seeking A Friend For The End Of The World a 5/10."

      "text": "This movie is quite quirky and the story starts pretty quickly, with the impending end of the world clearly conveyed within the first couple of minutes. The story seemed rather confusing in a way, in as much as trying to determine what genre it fits in, with there being somewhat sentimental moments as well as some quite crude sexual references and some dramatic moments too, at points.The relationship between Dodge (interesting name, I know - sounds like a car salesman lol) and Penny is quite interesting, they both have their individual quirks with one egging on the other and as the movie continues, we learn more about their backgrounds, moreso Dodge than Penny I suppose.Although the story in one sense, starts quite quickly, there was also a sense throughout of where exactly is this all going? plot wise - yes the end of world is nigh and they all know it but it did feel, or seem, to me like it meandered on a bit, for want of  a better term. Its entertaining and your left wondering what the ultimate outcome will be, quite where its going if you will but its not really all that edge-of-your-seat.Its a pretty entertaining movie overall, as the characters are interesting and your constantly curious to find out what happens next, at least to some extent. The basic concept is hardly original but its still an interesting thought - what if your suddenly having to deal with knowing the world will end and everyone will die, three weeks from now?, how will, or would, people deal with that?. Different scenarios or consequences are depicted, which do seem quite plausible, if not rather depressing, although I found myself questioning the chances of the more middle to upper class areas seeming to be almost unaffected by the sense of impending doom, while pretty extreme things are depicted as happening in other perhaps more run down areas - political/social commentary? hmmm.There is the odd moment thats quite funny, not majorly laugh out loud funny but amusing in a way, partly due to the absurdity of the situations present I suppose. Its quite a quirky movie overall, as previously mentioned and its hard to entirely put my finger on quite how that is the case, other than what I've already mentioned. I think its saved by the two main characters which are pretty likeable, although opinions may vary from viewer to viewer of course but I found myself feeling sorry for Dodge - others might relate more to Penny. They both may be seen as having lost their way somewhat even before the impending doom came to be public knowledge but you get the sense that their basically good people at the end of the day and wanting to find their way through a confusing time.I felt that the performances given were pretty good, pretty enthusiastic anyway, with Carrell again portraying a rather uncomfortable, somewhat shy and anxious middle aged man but it works well in this movie and Knightley gives a good performance as his extroverted neighbour, clearly more open minded but moreso optimistic, bright and pretty instantly likeable. The ending is rather dramatic but I felt that its credibility was rather negligible, not so much the fact of the world ending which, lets face it, the whole movie revolves around that but moreso the status of Dodge and Pennys relationship. I don't want to elaborate too much or it'll obviously lead to spoilers and could spoil enjoyment of the movie. I feel that for some it'll be a bit too sentimental in parts but those who hope for alot of that may be put off by the more crass sexual references featured mainly in the first half of the movie, so again it makes me wonder quite who this was targeted towards, rom-com fans or movies more like the American Pie franchise.Theme wise, obviously its about the end of the world but it also tackles issues about loneliness and tackling being estranged from family members etc.Content wise, there are the ocassional shock scene, with some bloody violence, although its pretty moderate but moreso (as already mentioned) there are sex references present, so this won't be to everyones taste. Other than that, there isn't too much likely to offend others I'd have thought - there may be some strong language although I can't recall anything particularly bad.This isn't necessarily your average drama or romantic comedy movie, its quite quirky but also still entertaining. It works due to the different characters and I felt curious throughout to find out how everything panned out in the end, although I did feel frustrated with the lack of a sense of direction within it. I think it depends, some people might quite enjoy this movie, while others may watch it and feel it was disappointing, so it just depends but the performances given seemed pretty good to me and so I'd say if your a fan of the main cast, or would like to see something that isn't quite entirely the norm as it were, then its worth watching - hopefully that makes sense(?)."
