It's predictable but twist on top! and writer/director Rowan Joff\u00e9 succeeds. When Ridley Scott thought that this was the movie that was supposed to be good it was not.

If you have seen 50 First Dates, the comedy flair might conceal how much said girl could be manipulated and abused. For those darker minds, Before I Go to Sleep will cater to your need. The film has a solid cast as well as good pacing and editing, but it might have just confined itself with the inflexible formula and repetitive thriller antics.\r Christine (Nicole Kidman) wakes up without memory from many years of her life, this is a daily struggle for her as her mind isn't capable of retaining new information. Ben (Colin Firth) as her husband must repeat the cycle of explanation every morning, it has become a taxing task to him. Christine seeks the help of Dr. Nasch (Mark Strong) to figure out how to resolve her memory issue, they slowly discover that her past life may be less happy than expected.\r The three main actors perform fantastically. Great acting range and in-depth characterization make their interactions into suspenseful human drama. Kidman is easily sympathetic as she displays sorrow with passion. Marks Strong is at his niche for playing authority figure, he has a charismatically calming presence, and meanwhile Firth portrays a man with compassion and possibly secrets. It's quite thrilling to see the film shifts between these personalities and ensures audiences question their motives.\r That being said, the premise doesn't offer much leeway for execution beyond what has already been done before, a bit ironic since it's only used prominently in 50 First Dates and Christopher Nolan's Memento. The movie often recycles the events due to necessity, or relies on plot devices which are predictable such as overused visual clues or simple gimmick. This may slow down the pace and lessen the twists it has in store.\r Nevertheless, it has good production value with cool cinematography and amazing cast. Before I Go to Sleep might be fleeting, but it is a satisfactory mystery thriller."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Upon its release, Rowan Joffe's Before I Go to Sleep often received comparisons to Memento as that film was also a thriller that focused on an amnesiac trying to remember how he wound up the way he is and figure out who he can trust. However, I not like Memento, so I went into Before I Go to Sleep without comparing it to a film that I enjoy. As a result, I did quite like Before I Go to Sleep. It is undeniably cliched and introduces memories or random actions by Christine Lucas (Nicole Kidman) out of plot convenience that entirely contradict the fact that she cannot remember. The film also nosedives into melodrama at the very end with a tearjerking final sequence that may make you cry, but feels manipulative. That said, the film is just so tense. It is mysterious, thrilling, and laced with suspense as we live alongside Christine as she tries to figure out who attacked her and deals with emotions evoked by memories, all while trying to figure out who to trust.Following a brutal attack, Christine Lucas remembers nothing. She believes she is in her 20s and wakes up everyday being informed about who she is, where she is, and what she does by her husband Ben (Colin Firth). After Ben leaves for work, Dr. Nasch (Mark Strong) calls her and reminds her to check for a camera in her wardrobe closet where she records a visual diary daily. He then proceeds to meet her during the day behind Ben's back, who does not want her to remember for fear of her getting upset. The film's tensions continue to rise as we are given cause to not trust both Ben and Dr. Nasch at various points before we come back and believe them again, only to then proceed to continue questioning if they are what they say they are. This is the source of Before I Go to Sleep's greatest amount of tension as this mystery and suspense that unfolds rivals something akin to a Hitchcock film with how it keeps you in the dark. With Christine's illness, we constantly must try and add two-and-two together with the limited details that she can add throughout the day. What compounds the mystery is the fact that both Firth and Strong are British and as Hollywood has taught me, never trust a Brit because they are all shifty. Yet, the film forces us to pick who to trust and it makes it all the more compelling as common sense says neither are wholly trustworthy.Plot-wise, as mentioned, the film is pretty run-of-the-mill. This may be writer-director Rowan Joffe's fault as the film entirely relies upon the disease of its protagonist and then willingly breaks the rules it sets when convenient, particularly with regard to the reveal of who her attacker was. After initially stating that going to the site of the attack does not work, the film then goes and has the site of the attack bring back memories of it for Christine. That said, when the film threatens to just boil down into a pretty typical who can you trust thriller, it throws in a compelling twist that really breathes life into the film seamlessly. This final twist is really what saves Before I Go to Sleep from being a pretty tame thriller, as well as excellent lead performances from Nicole Kidman, Colin Firth, and Mark Strong. Each actor turns in a shifty performance that really makes you begin to wonder their true intentions, only to then turn around and seem entirely trustworthy. Yet, we know somebody cannot be trusted. Is it Christine? Is her broken mind playing tricks on her even now? Is it Ben? Is he really just protecting her or is he hiding more? Is it Dr. Nasch? Is he really a doctor? Why does he now want Ben to find out about the treatment? For all of its cliches and narrative shortcomings, Before I Go to Sleep winds up still being a truly entertaining film that shows that a fun, twisty, and slick thriller that has echoes of Hitchcock (who would have directed the hell out of this) can still turn into a pretty good piece of cinema. While not exactly an artistic accomplishment and one that could have used a more capable of director, this one entertains and constantly keeps you an edge with a chilling premise, excellent acting, and eerie score."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Before I Go to Sleep tries to be Memento but fails miserably at doing so, with an only apparently convoluted plot which actually leaves traces of its conclusion everywhere - so that when the final twist arrives, there's not much left to think but \"I knew it\". The mediocre production sets the disappointing mood for the as much mediocre performance by Nicole Kidman, and the as much disappointing performance by Colin Firth.\r Also, major, major plot holes throughout and inexplicable character development (a character who should NOT have changed one bit, following plot,  is actually shifting towards another person entirely). Not worth the time."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Well acted film that unfortunately is very overwrought. It's too complex for its own good and kind of plays out like a made for TV thriller which is a shame since it has such a grade A cast."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Before I Go to Sleep is a 2014 mystery psychological thriller film written and directed by Rowan Joff\u00e9 and based on the 2011 novel Before I Go to Sleep by S. J. Watson.Christine Lucas (Nicole Kidman)  plays the role of a woman who upon waking up every morning with no memory of her life from her early twenties onwards. Christine secretyly receives treatment from Dr. Nasch, a neuropsychologist at a local hospital who gives her a camera to record her thoughts and progress each day, and calls her every morning to remind her to watch the video in the camera...Amazing performance by Nicole Kidman. The pacing and tension are pretty well brought out. However, the plot is a little too simple, and does not have any unexpected twist to awe the viewers."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "The movie had its strong points - good performances from all actors, especially Colin Firth in my opinion as I am used to him being in a different type of role usually. Also the beginning of the movie was interesting and unpredictable, but afterwards it slowly downgraded, the plot twists started to seem too predictable and everything unfolded in quite a boring way at the end. I mean, it lacked substance at the end and basically after you knew what is the plot twist it got quite boring and everything what you thought will happened basically happened. At least in my opinion. So what it would have needed was something more from the story or at least an unexpected ending."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Thriller. Amnesiac Nicole Kidman acts impressively through the full range of emotions re-discovering memories. Piecing together the full truth invloves some shocks along the way and there is some violence.

The idea would be very interesting if it had been well developed by the script, but it didn't. As the film goes by, the villain becomes too obvious, as are the plot holes. One of the most obvious is the marriage of Christine (the name of the character, played by Nicole Kidman): if her condition of amnesia causes her to forget only the memories from a given moment of life forward, and if that moment happened when she was already married or, at least, the girlfriend of the one who would become her husband, how could she forget his face? This is just an example of a plot hole I discovered. I will not give more so I will not spoil the whole story.

The main theme is trust - trust and personal identity. It features quite a strong use of stringed instruments in the majority of scenes to add to the sense of rush, panic and tension presumably felt by the characters involved in said scenes.Nicole Kidman does well portraying Christine as a confused, disorientated yet also strong willed and determined woman. I could feel her frustration and confusion as she tried to regain memory of key times and events in her and her families past. Colin Firth plays her other half, Ben, who is quite stoic, someone rather matter-of-fact like, who 'tells it like it is'. Other cast members include Mark Strong as Doctor Nasch, who has apparently been treating Christine for her insomnia, Anne-Marie Duff as Claire and Dean-Charles Chapman as Adam. I thought that both Kidman and Firth gave decent performances in this film, which helped it seem more believable as they played their roles convincingly.There is a fair amount of whispers present in the film, so its possible that some people, perhaps those who may be hard of hearing,  may struggle to fully follow dialogue in parts, although I managed to follow the majority of it. It may be worth turning the volume up on your TV if you think this would be an issue - there are relatively few scenes where there is constant loud pitched noise, so that shouldn't cause too much of an issue I'd have thought.I was impressed with the way the soundtrack really emphasised the clear tension and general mystery surrounding most of the scenes and the plot in general. There are some scenes in which we see Christine looking through a peep hole and a long corridor is presented in fisheye lens format (curved at the sides). The camera zooms in on her eye, with spookily red veins present and then on what she sees, sometimes tinged in a spooky orange colour tint. It reminded me, very briefly, of more gory films such as perhaps The Shining, although no extremely graphic gore is present in this film (some vioence but not so much gore).Speaking of content, this film contains some strong language, some sex references and partial nudity and some bloody violence, mostly in flashbacks. It is relatively spooky and potentially frightening, certainly to young viewers, hence the 15 rating it carries. I wouldn't have thought it would be likely to particularly upset people, as it handles the topics the plot contains quite sensitively overall I thought.As the film continues, the plot slowly unwinds, although it seems, certainly early on, as if its almost impossible for real truths to be discovered. The critic in mean felt as if it was slightly unlikely for Christine to somehow, as if by magic, be able to piece things together, as she does but having said that, its not as if everything goes smoothly or all is entirely clear and I certainly felt like I was entertained while watching the film. It is a relatively immersive film and at just under an hour and a half long, its a good film to watch if you have a relatively short time to watch a film. For what it is, its pretty decent.Yes I'd recommend this film, as I felt it featured good performances, a curious and intriguing plot, it was relatively immersive and spooky and thus a decent drama/thriller/mystery."}], "recommendations": ["prisoners", "the_machinist", "run", "the_woman_in_the_window", "the_good_liar", "the_unforgivable", "split", "anna", "the_next_three_days", "the_little_things", "the_invisible_man", "the_rental", "gone_girl", "i_see_you", "thelma", "a_simple_favor", "widows", "elle", "stillwater", "zodiac", "the_beguiled", "the_call", "predestination", "a_history_of_violence", "what_lies_beneath"]}
