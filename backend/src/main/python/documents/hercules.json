The interesting parts from the trailer (Hercules fighting various mythical beasts) take up the first minute of the film. The rest is taken up by a horribly boring, predictable plot which doesn't even have any mythical elements to it.\r The dialogue is cliche and cheesy. The characters are all stereotypes who don't get much development through the film. The action is painfully average, and there's a lot of poorly-done CGI. Giving Hercules a team instead of making him a solo hero (or at least, limiting it to 1 companion) is also a strange choice that I thought made the movie a lot worse. So was making Hercules into some mercenary type anti-hero guy - that just doesn't work for a mythological hero like Hercules.\r Overall I'm highly disappointed.

The story line is weak and short sighted and the cast of characters was very poorly cast. Many people in the movie shouldn't have been there and the story line is very dull and extremely fast paced. You don't have time to enjoy any scene for the proper amount of time. There are no innovative action scenes that make you really enjoy the imagery. The attitudes of people in the movie in regards to legends is such a turnoff for a movie like this. You walk in to see mythical stories and mythical imagery and instead you get lingo that sounds like it's from 2014 and people who disregard the legend of Hercules. \"Literalists\" have ruined a great mythical story and one of my favorites; Hercules. This movie seemed to be entirely made to disregard the legend of Hercules instead of telling a beautiful modern adaptation of the story which many people enjoy.

Sadly \"Hercules\" falls into that category.\r By no means is this movie BAD but it isn't an excuse to call it Good simply because it could be worse. I am completely on board with the whole realistic take on Hercules and having his deeds be what becomes the spoken legend of the man, but the movie have trouble deciding if Hercules is actually a demi-god or simply a really tough man.\r We see him get hit by arrows, cut, stabbed, thrown, beaten, yet in the final confrontation, he has little to no signs of any physical pain. He hits his enemies over 20ft OFF their own horse and can kick a large wooden object a few yards at a high enough velocity to knock someone out.\r This movie would've been amazing if they focused on his Trials and kept the realistic (non demi-god) aspect to it rather than a Braveheart meet Spartacus ripoff with a (predictable) twist of them turning against him.\r I feel like they had an AMAZING cast choice with Dwayne Johnson, but if they would've stuck to a concept, and provided more of a story than Hercules overcoming a random army that he in turn trained, it could've been a memorable movie.\r Story - 3\rActing - 6\rCGI - 6\rAction - 7\rRewatchable - 3"}, {"rating": "0", "text": "This movie is not about myth.

I almost believed every second. Perhaps if not for the overly dramatic battle sequences, cornballish one liners, and some CGI heavy effects that could use some work. That being said, if not for Johnson and Ratner, we probably would be looking at a far worse version of the Kellan Lutz driven vehicle that opened back in January.\r Johnson is the lion-sheep head wearing mercenary in full forced-a hired gun, but also a tabloid of the gods. The answer is that is he human? or god? He travels in style with the realm of a C.S Lewis novel at his side. (Yes, this was a reference to Narnia). Lured by riches, and seeking revenge for the unspecified death of his family.\r At the film's best it reminded me of Zack Snyder's 300, while of course THIS film is rated PG13, so the blood spewing will be put to a minimum and Johnson who has brought life to many franchises including; \"GI Joe\" and \"Fast and Furious\". Is right in the typical macho wheelhouse he is normally accustomed too. When the big ferocious muscle induced hero is fighting the bad guys it all feels right. Brett Ratner (Rush Hour films) knows how to shoot some inept stylized action sequences, which I was engulfed entirely. However after the second battle (Which clocks in at about ten minutes) I was feeling a little fatigued.\r Then, when the somewhat predictable finale the film follows--they expect the audience to be shocked as if we didn't see this coming. Most fans will bypass this flaw, I just kind of shrugged my shoulders and accepted it. The best scenes are the one's when Hercules has too ask himself who he is, and what he is there for. You probably saw this in the trailer \"I AM HERCULES!!!!!\" he shouts to the screen. Somehow during that scene my heart was beating pretty profusely. So, to some extent, the film had an effect on me.\r The latest adaptation of \"Hercules\" was much better then it probably could have been (this is not saying much). I can almost guarantee that it will wash the tireless taste out of the forsaken \"Legend Of Hercules\" out of your mouth. I did actually enjoy the film when it all boils down. Probably because there is just enough plot to inch the film along, and more than enough battle escapades to at least distract me from the much bigger picture, which is probably a horrible film.\r B-\r By: Nate Adams\r Directed By: Brett Ratner\rRated: PG13\rRuntime: 96 mins\rStudio: Paramount Pictures\rRelease Date: July 25th 2014\r Thanks For Stopping By \u00ae"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "A fun movie that entertains.

I thought the characters were so fun to watch as they all made their journey\u2019s as mercenaries.

In this review and others to come, I will always say that the movie lives and dies with the villain. Sometimes the villain can carry a movie to greatness, and sometimes it can hinder the movies progress. This was one of the latter times. First off, when we left the theater, my nephew asked me if I liked it and I told him I was unsure because I loved the supporting cast and the Rock is always fun to see on screen, but I didn't like the villain all that much. His reply sealed it for me when he said...who was the villain.\r As I said, I thought the cast that supported the demigod was great. Rufus Sewell and Ian McShane added much of the needed comic relief, but Aksel Hennie's berserker was a little too much for me. Over all, the cast was the strongest part of this film aside from Dwayne himself.\r In movies like this when we don't get to see the growth of the villain, it does a great disservice to the audience. I get why we didn't with the \"saw that one coming\" twist mid way through, but still, it just didn't work in this film. And what made me the most upset was towards the end, I felt that I was being manipulated, almost forced into hating the villain as he was saying things that would make anyone wanna pop him one. I want to hate the villain on my own terms, I want to come to the end of the film and feel vindicated or saddened at the death of he or she...but here...I couldn't have cared less what happened to him.\r This one is worth a rent, but no need to rush to your local theater to catch it on the big screen.

It attempts to humanize Hercules, presenting the man behind the legend, which is quite admirable compared to other grandiose renditions that share the same title or action movies in general that depict superhuman characters. Unfortunately, the plot is highly predictable and aside a few decent skirmishes, it doesn't offer anything notable.\r The story portrays Hercules as a mercenary, although his previous acts and original are usually shrouded by excessive storytelling, which serendipitously benefits him. Along the way it delves deeper on the titular personality, shedding bits of mythical tales to reveal the actual man. This concept is sound, although neither pacing nor screenplay manages to reach that level of accomplishment. In short, it's rather boring. There are far too many similar elements from other adventure movies, even from Johnson's own Scorpion King from last decade, and it's not presented in better fashion. Humor and banter rarely hit the mark, thus making the story build up from first acts stagnant.\r Johnson as the star is an imposing figure, often instilling larger than life persona. How he succeeds in pulling off the worthy Hercules look is half the movie already, and to his credit, Johnson has the heart aside from the brawn. The rest of the cast are fine addition, Hercules' ragtag band of mercenary fits the bill, while John Hurt and Ralph Fiennes round up as the kings. Unfortunately, there's little engaging interaction and what transpire is pretty straightforward. Scenes flow with barely any momentum, they are very slow and plagued by average stereotypical situation.\r Action does happen, even if some spark of brilliance is only sighted for few brief moments. Although scale isn't as big and choreography is average, the battles are still serviceable. Use of CG, and 3D for that matter, is a bit underwhelming. For the beasts are apparently artificial, and as far as debris go, throwing them into audience's eyes is far too outdated underhanded tactic. The movie does take advantage of the mature rating to deliver more visceral combat, it may not be complex, but it has impacts for most part.\r The intention of displaying more human side of Hercules is noble, however with such thin content, the movie is hardly equipped for such profound task. Dwayne Johnson could probably give more to the role, but he is definitely an appealing personality suited to be Hercules.
