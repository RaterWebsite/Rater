I was hoping this would be eddie murphy's comeback, not.... this.All I have to say is that if you're a Murphy fan like me, you'll only need one sentence to be warned away:  \"This film is on par with Pluto Nash.\"A horrendous dumpster fire, I barely laughed.  Arsenio Hall and Eddie Murphy are supposed to be two funny guys, but yet the only actor who could squeak out a laugh (he made me laugh ONCE, which was the only time this COMEDY MOVIE did) was WESLEY SNIPES, who's more notable for his serious roles.  If you loved the first movie, don't kill your nostalgia for it by watching this garbage.  Jesus Eddie, what the hell man?!"

The storyline with the women's rights could be implemented well, but is just badly designed just to have a feministic base. I still had hope that the movie wouldn't be that bad, but it's actually worse than my low expectations. But unfortunately this is only another sequel, resulting from the \u201clust for money\u201d of the production studios and unfortunately also of the actors. Rap, feminism, wokeness, curvyness, blackness and sexual freedom - a classic streaming film from 2021. Sad And that's what I say as a 20-year-old young person. Destroys nostalgia!"

That being sad Norbit, The Nutty Professor movies, and Life are 100x funnier than this sequel. It is funnier than Barb And Star if you have seen that.Pros: Returning characters (Amos,J.E. Jones, etc.)Eddie, and Arsenio in SFX makeup as characters from first movie, and one new one by Arsenio which was amusing. Wesley Snipes was decent, but needed some funnier scenes. Instead of same thing over, and over.Leslie Jones did her usual, but a little of her goes a long way.Cons:New characters (The Young Male Lead, Luenell, Tracy Morgan)When I'm watching this movie I want to see Arsenio, and Eddie. Instead I get way too much of the new guy, and his family. Luenell is wasted just sits around for most scenes, and has barely any lines (Why?)The background songs in this movie are awful, really annoyingly bad. The scene with the young male lead where he raps is head slappingly cringeworthy.Eddie is way too laid back in this as Hakeem, and only shines when in SFX makeup as another character. In the original he isn't over the top funny as Hakeem but  he is more entertaining because of the fish out of water experience he is having in New York. This time he is in Zamunda most of the movie, and it makes Hakeem BORING.Sorry Eddie, love a lot of your work but this needed a lot more refining."

For a movie that tried to earn its PG by making a movie for everyone rating ended up making African/black people tied to every negative stereotype invented.

      "text": "Welcome back to Wakanda... *coughs*, I mean, Zamunda. After 30 years of no one waiting for this, we finally got our sequel to Coming to America with Coming 2 America. Oh, so clever there. Long awaited and overdue but also, maybe, too late as well. Either way, Coming 2 America follows our favorite heir of Zamunda, Prince Akeem, as he secures his family legacy after learning he has a long-lost son in the United States. He returns to Queens to meet this unexpected heir and bring him back to Zamunda to build a relationship with him. Of course, if everything were that easy, there wouldn't be a movie but the rest we will leave up to you to detail the story. Let's see what we got.Let's be honest, they pulled out all the stops with this movie. All of black acting and comedy royalty appear in this movie. The costumes and sets were all over the top and amazing. Rick Ross' house and Tyler Perry Studios definitely have everything you need for a regal movie set. The biggest qualm I know people are going to have is that this doesn't feel anything like the original. Yes, they take us down memory lane throughout the movie, but it hasn't brought back the feeling from 1988. We all know societal norms and acceptances and culture have changed since then. Nevertheless, after 30 years, it's impossible to recapture that comedic magic without being corny or overly campy. In fact, if I'm being honest, this movie is like 20 to 25 years too late. You can even hear how late it is in Eddie Murphy's accent, or lack there of. I'm going to tell you all now, \"Get over it!\"Where this movie succeeds is that the cast is full of life. The themes of the film are nice and cute for the family. Just like Eddie's career as a whole, he's moved on to making films his kids can watch and be proud of, and there's nothing wrong with that. Coming 2 America has jokes that call back to the past, connections to comics and artists of the present but also ideals that people really shouldn't be fighting so hard to hold on to. The movie comes full circle but part of the issue is that we've been around and around this circle so many times. They waited 30 years to give us essentially the same movie and then just added in a storyline that has been beat to death over the last 5-10 years. This is where I think the filmmakers really missed. You don't call on an iconic film to make it ordinary but that's what we got. The thought of this movie feels rushed but we also come against the fact that the movie feels too long.Coming 2 America is a movie that any family with teens and young adults can sit down and enjoy. The movie is in no way in the same ballpark as the original, but that shouldn't take away from the enjoyment you can get from it. I'd wish for more originality from this flick but I'll settle for endless cameos, nostalgic laughs and the cheap price of the movie. The actual movie is just a handful of popcorn but for the culture grab yourself a bowl and enjoy the call to the past."

Because the situation is from a female to a male I don\u2019t see any complaints but if it were the opposite way pretty sure it would be people screaming RAPE. Then, nobody on the entire movie think about a paternity test, so, in reality we will never know if is his son for real.

The film starts with rollicking exuberance and a lavish musical celebration. It\u2019s also genuinely funny, esp. when Leslie Jones is on screen. Sadly, when they return to Africa the story toggles from the funnybone to the heart with a love story for the son (Jermaine Fowler). There are plenty of cameos, including Trevor Noah and Colin Jost, who\u2019s less stiff than he was in Tom & Jerry. The comedy highpoint was the barber shop full of Murphy characters. Ruth E. Carter, who did equally exceptional work for Black Panther, has designed wonderful Afro-centric wardrobes (that BIG wedding dress). While there\u2019s lots of comic energy and every actor is having a great time, the indulgence of dramatic interactions drags the movie down. NOTE: Sit thru the credits for outtakes, John Legend\u2019s lovely performance and one final gag at the end."

      "text": "It's hard to watch C2A and not draw direct comparisons to the original, in fact it's impossible. Why? Because the film is so intentionally self-referential that it practically begs you to, with so many returning characters and recycled jokes.However, it IS a pretty good comedy... IF you understand it's a continuation from the original i.e. a sequel, rather than watch it with that comparative mindset and judge it against what is probably Eddie Murphy's funniest film.The plot is basic, with the fish out of water being Prince/King Akeem's illegitimate son being brought from Queens NY, to Zamunda because of ages old succession laws requiring only a male heir to possess the throne. Throw in a subplot with a neighbouring state looking to get their offspring onto the throne for political/financial reasons and the story moves along quite nicely.From an acting perspective Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall look like they're really enjoying themselves, as do all the actors returning from the first film (Shari Headley still looks gorgeous 32 years later!). The new actors/characters, especially the younger ones, aren't so good. Jermaine Fowler as Akeem's son Lavelle in particular lacks the charisma needed for the role, outside the comedy elements which he does do well. Wesley Snipes is hilarious as the Dictator from the neighbouring state, and pretty much steals all the scenes he's in.But, there are problems with the film. It lacks bite and that sense of dread which the first movie had. Being R-rated CTA was able to derive characterisations/humour/depth through racism/profanity/culture clashes that C2A simply can't. It's newer PG-13 'woke' mantra means so much of that is replaced with trying to breathe modern sensibilities into a cliched narrative.Overall though, it isn't terrible... It's just always going to compare unfavourably to it's predecessor."
