      "text": "The omission of Ozu\u2019s oeuvre is definitely an unerring embarrassment for any movie aficionado, thankfully TOKYO STORY comes to my rescue, presumably Ozu\u2019s most renowned work, tellingly it merits all kudos it gets, gracefully scrutinising the post-WWII mental disposition of Japanese people, and quietly tearjerking in eliciting recollections and rumination between parents and their children. Parenthood is not for everyone, but we all have parents, we forever hold a sense of regret towards them, especially in the oriental culture, filial piety is the foremost virtue to measure an individual\u2019s worth, at least viewed by other family members.\r keep reading my review on my blog, google: cinema omnivore, thanks!"

      "text": "I keep reading how people say how great this movie is, I have watched it twice, 10 years apart.  What i see is callous, selfish people. 3 generations of them.  They never care one bit about each other, only whether they are personally inconvenienced.  The daughter in law that is a widow to the son who died was sweet and lonely, everyone else seems only interested in running out the clock until death and being distracted from that goal.  There is no love, no depth, only selfish people unconscious of their lives and the world around them, just like real people.  Robots judging robots, fake statements, fake emotions. It's like the Borg (Star Trek) had a funeral."

      "text": "A very dense and slow film. Although its duration is not excessive it feels that way.That doesn't mean in any way that this is a bad film because without a doubt it's perhaps one of the best dramas I've seen in my life but it's a very slow film that needs attention, patience and taste for this kind of cinema to be able to appreciate all its angles and qualities. And I doubt I made it completely."

      "text": "Tokyo Story is a beautiful work of art with a very important message, to pay attention to everyone, and in this film especially your parents. The film expresses that with showing an old couple visit their children, and you could think that it's not enough to base a film around but somehow Tokyo Story make it look so simple and deliver it so perfectly. That's one of the reasons that make this film so special. Another thing is how its made, the film is of course very old and the way of filming was sourly very different back then. The film is so casual and something other films don't tend to include or think about to include is well built-in in this film, and it's those little things which make it so special. I also think this film could not be made again the same way nor some other way then it did, it just so perfect with the time period, the culture, the characters, the atmosphere, etc. But the film still has so much reflection of the reality and maybe more than ever."
