Although Spy Kids 3 wasn't that great for 3-D viewing just the 2-D is way better. A fourth installment with no Carmen and Juni may seem feel a little queasy and with a long set of casting, I have no other choice but to make Spy Kids: All the Time in the World needs to put this franchise into bedtime. And on second thought, a wasteless movie of the so-called \"4-D\" \"Aroma-Scope.\" It will make your eyes scanned into a lava pit."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "Super blah!!!! This is a huge disappointment to the spy kids series. This is a slap in the face for the spy kids lovers. Super boring and nothing intresting.

Writing, directing, acting sucked every bit."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "Skip-it - This spy family film's \"clever\" 4-D concept with scratch-and-sniff cards might be more intriguing if the movie didn't smell like poop and puke - but maybe director Robert Rodriguez just wanted the fourth dimension to stink as bad as the other three?"}, {"rating": "1", "text": "Why ? Just why they had to destroy the perfect trilogy of '' Spy Kids \" ? But no, they had to make a fourth one. The kids weren't that adorable. They seemed like ordinary children fighting with one and another. Plus, the girl named Rebecca (Rowan Blanchard, whoever she is) is a little brat, not likable as a character. The jokes are stupid and immature. Once in the movie, there was literally three fart jokes in a row. The humor was cheesy and painful to watch (because of the embarrassment for the actors). There was also a spy dog (of course) named Argonaut, with a British accent. It's like if it's supposed to make the audience think that there having a good time. It has cheesy spy lines and scenes (for example, when the villain says '' you're to late '' or some **** like that). The '' action '' is sometimes ridiculously exaggerated. When the kid throws balls on the floor, the guards are falling so hard (like there doing back flips). I like the fact that they brought back the original spy kids (Carmen Cortez and  Juni Cortez). It was fun seeing them older. So has a kid, I enjoyed the first three Spy Kids movies, but the fourth one was unnecessary to make."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "With incredibly large amounts of cheap-looking CGI, unfunny toilet humor, bland and uninteresting characters, and the fact that it has even more terribly implemented gimmicks than Game Over did (now with a repertoire of indistinguishable smells), Spy Kids 4D is proof that the franchise has seriously lost its charm and - fittingly - its identity. Stick with the first two movies, as they are vastly superior to this load of gimmicky tripe."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "This is one of the worst films I have EVER seen. I literally fell asleep from boredom of it and that's a first. NONE of the actors can actually act and they are awful at it. The director has made an awful mess of it. For example in one scene they're all fighting, then the little girl stops and start talking and you can see that all around her the baddies are just jumping up and down on the spot. Finally, the film is just plain stupid. For example the dad actually creates a spy tracker which can actually detect real spies. That's just ridiculous. Also, in the end it wouldn't have mattered whether they had or hadn't stopped the baddie which just makes the whole thing pointless. The only good thing about this film was the talking dog."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "This is a total waste of time if it wasn't aimed at children. You don't want to see this without your child that is for sure. I felt that the movie was weakly written (except for the dog in the movie). This movie is offered in 4D and that means that we got a card and it was in Smell-O-Vision of some sort. The thing that turned me off this movie the most was the fact that they aim it at children, but have to say \"OH Shi---taki mushrooms. What the heck is that all about. The comedy that the dog gave was funny. I guess they were trying to keep the parents who had to suffer through this entertained, but they failed miserably. You have to take your child to go see this only for the fact that they're going to love it and it is always fun to watch the children react to the different scenes. The 3D was good and my daughter kept trying to reach for the things floating around. You are going to laugh at some points, but for an overall movie, you might want to skip this. They make you smell poop for heavens sake!"}, {"rating": "1", "text": "What a way to ruin my childhood memories it wasnt good and lame. they should a stayed with 3 and not make 4.

Worst Movie of the Decade (followed by GR2)..!!!!!!!!! And I really mean by the mother of the worst 2011 movies!"}, {"rating": "3", "text": "First and foremost, realize that this is a movie for young kids.  That said, the fact that your making a movie for kids does not mean that it does not need a coherent plot, sincere acting or thoughtful direction.\r The movie is cute.  The kids, played by Rowan Blanchard and Mason Cook, are by far the best part.  They're cute, they seem to enjoy themselves for the most part.  Rowan Blanchard in particular showed a good range of character and emotion.  As well Jeremy Piven was great.  He seemed to have fun with the role, and seemed to really try to do what he could within the constraints of the script and the direction.  Ricky Gervais as the voice of the dog was also great, but again, within the script and direction.\r I can't help but feel that they, and this movie as a whole, could have shined, if only ....\r First, the biggest problem with this movie is that the vast majority of the humor involves farts, vomit and poop.  I think that's an insult to kids everywhere.  You can walk up to a kid almost anywhere, make a funny face and say \"Poo-Poo\" and get a laugh.  It doesn't mean it's actually funny.  The humor was an embarrassment.\r The script needed to be tighter.  It's like they started with a great idea, and then a whole bunch of people got involved and said \"Yeah, but wouldn't it be better if ...\"  No.  It wouldn't.  The script needed a lot of trimming, especially with the throwaway subplot of the Dad's failed TV career.  It was just too rushed.  And that's just ONE example.  Ironically, in a movie absolutely overflowing with idioms and metaphors about TIME, the writers tried to cram too many ideas into too little time.  Focus, people!\r The movie would have been better without the baby.  I would just eliminate her from the plot completely. What I really liked in the writing was the message about spending time with family.  They did sort of bludgeon the message to death, but I liked the fact that they focused not only on the time parents spend with their kids, but the time kids are willing to spend with their parents.  They showed neglectful parents AND neglectful kids, and I liked that.  That message, in a better, more focused plot, would have gone down a lot better.\r Finally, I enjoyed seeing Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara back as Carmen and Juni Cortez ... BUT, I feel that they were only really INTO this movie when they were TOGETHER.  Together, they had chemistry, and familiarity and fun.  Apart ... they just seemed distant and dislocated.  And again, we COULD have made the movie without them.  It was nice to see the original Spy Kids all grown up, but it was subplot we could have trimmed and not really known it was gone.\r Overall, this was NOT a horrible movie, but it could have been a lot better."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "I think Rodriguez was surprised that this was his movie. It loses it's Spy Kids taste with no humor (or should I say nice try at trying to be funny) and unflavored action. It also gives us awful performances by not only Alba and the family but also by the reuniting cast of the old Spy Kids, which also made the film unneccesary.

This movie was good, but not good enough. You like the kids, and i likes how they showed the original kids as adults in the movie, but it just wasn't enough. The movie itself was good. It mimiced the first movie very well. If you had to compare movie one to movie four, movie one wins. On it's own, however, it is pretty good. I don't believe it deserves to be bombed, but it doesn't deserve anything above an 8 at all. Also, let me warn you. The aromascope didn't work, and I never expected it too. Being able to smell things on the screen doesn't enhance the movie at all. It isn't a proper use of any future 4D tools."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Yes, it certainly is disappointing  that Robert Zemeckis lost the magic of these movies, especially since he has had nothing to do with any of them.

Here's the perspective of two kids, aged 7 and 9, and their parents, none of whom were actually aware (shock horror) that other Spy Kids films existed:\rWe all thought it was a lot of of fun: silly, funny, hyperactive fun. I chuckled and was engaged, and the insubstantial silliness of the plot was just fine with me: it sort of reminded me of the old Batman TV series.\rMy kids rated it 10 and 9 respectively.\rI do think, when reviewing a kids' film it's worth remembering:\ra: Despite film-makers' strenuous attempts to make kid's films appeal to parents, what the kids think of it is pretty much the main thing.\rb: Under-10s watching a film released in 2011 will not be comparing it with other, related films made before they were born, so the comparison is academic: do try to judge a film on its own terms.\rSo, if your kids are miniature Mark Kermodes, or you've seen the other films and demand a fulfilling movie-going experience for yourself, probably best to steer clear. Otherwise, dare I say it, it's really cool."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "Spy Kids 4 is a film, whose target audience - children under 12.

The gimmick was a loving throwback to the 1960 film Scent Of A Mystery that was shown in Smell-O-Vision, but like most of Waters\u2019 homages, the olfactory obnoxiousness actually fit the tone of the film. With a female protagonist cursed by an acute, almost uncanny sense of smell, a son who regularly got high on glue and a plot featuring a skuzzy porn theater and foot fetishes, those occasional whiffs of rancid putrescence were like horrifying and hilarious sniffs inside Polyester\u2019s outlandish world. The film may not have needed Odorama, but it certainly benefitted from it. The same cannot be said for Spy Kids: All The Time In The World. Robert Rodriguez is a good director. He\u2019s made some wonderful movies in the past, but focus has to be altered based on subject matter. Traditionally, it is better for characters to have heart and clearly defined reasons for their actions, but in a film as absurd as Spy Kids 4, those specifics don\u2019t really need to waffle, alter and say something bigger about life. More is not always better, especially when it suffocates the joy that should be inherent in a project like this. It\u2019s not a total loss. There are a handful of scenes in Spy Kids 4 that really do work. Somewhere, hidden beneath all the forced hugs, there\u2019s a lot of fun to be had, but ultimately, that digging just isn\u2019t worth it, even if you do get some cool scents along the way."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Worst Film EVER!!!\r Pros\rNONE\r Cons\rTerrible Story\rWorst Screenplay in film history\rBoring\rBaby\rNot even appealing to kids\rAwful Characters\rPredictable"}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Terrible film.
