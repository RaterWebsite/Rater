After a detour to their family's old farmhouse, they discover a group of crazed, murderous outcasts living next door.

The establishing shots in the early parts of the film are so moody, slow and dread inducing - a fitting set-up for what comes later. This is how it's done."

It was only then i began to appreciate the movie and the intensity of the atmosphere that surrounded the whole movie in general, Yes it still scares the *bleep* out of me but thats why i love it, It makes me feel every emotion under the sun, Claustrophobia, Fear, Tension, Joy, Reflection, and bloomin' well thankful that i wont ever come across Leatherface anytime soon!"

Considering it's mid 70's I still managed to enjoy it and can see how effective this would have been back then, perhaps not so much now but still its a very well done Horror film, and was probably the first of its kind back then. All things considered its not a great film, but I'll give it props for still making me jump!"

      "text": "On the face of it, it looks pretty amateurish but looking deeper the extensive dolly shots, moody imposing angles and intense zooms make for very original cinematography. It is so gritty and so ugly but it fits the content perfectly. It sounds messy and the music is ill timed at places but this adds to the believability and intense realism. Compared to the relatively soulless remake The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) which utilises much higher production-values I think that the sound and vision really complement the content. This is really scary and so intense considering the age of the film. It contains many memorable moments and you can understand why it spawned so many sequels which took the characters and turned them into eighties franchise clich\u00e9s. This first film was totally original and brutally fascinating to watch. It is unrelenting. I forgot how amazing this horror really is. Although technically not perfect this is the perfectly constructed horror."

Although some scenes seem overplayed today, and splatter-fans wont be too disturbed by it, 'Massacre' still packs a punch with its nightmareish dusty red visuals and slow but determined development. The deaths themselves are rather unique, since they are done in a brutal but almost offhanded manner, in contrast to the \"look, see? He's dead! Isn't it horrible??\" style of many modern horror movies. The final piece of the puzzle is the experimental but fitting musical score, which compliments the visuals very well. A movie that holds its own, even today."

I mean it was made it 1974 for crying out loud and it's not hard to imagine how terrifying it must have been to people back then. Today however it's not scary in the least and can be rather boring. Sometimes it's even annoying.\r The excellent portrayal of the crazy, backwoods family is still kind of creepy and absurd in a black-humor sort of way. However outside of that and the influence it had on the genre there's nothing else that stands out about it. At least not in a good way.\r The pacing has aged mostly well, but some scenes just drag on for too long. Was it really necessary to have a prolonged section where Marilyn Burns is just screaming non-stop for several minutes? It's old-school filmmaking decisions like that which make the film kind of hard to watch today.\r It's definitely a classic of the horror genre. However it's just not one that's aged well at all. Due to it's legacy it's one I can say I'm glad I watched. I just can't say that I enjoyed it. It's a piece of horror history that any hardcore genre aficionado should check out. However doing so means putting up with a lot of issues brought on by age. Because of that it really is only for the most hardcore of horror fans."

The film could easily have had a lot of development with a more serious tone but I guess that isn't what they were going for. There's no music or anything. The scariest part of the whole movie is the intro, the vibe of which is totally abandoned afterwards. It is surprisingly light hearted for what you are actually witnessing. It gets points for being different but its another cult film where you go is that it? The name The Texas Chainsaw Massacre has carried with it a lot of weight and gravitas ever since I first heard it. After seeing the movie any mystique that the movie earned has certainly gone out the window."

I couldn't have been more wrong, some of the best of the genres are anything but these. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the best, it screams horror classic from the character Leatherface to the many times it's been imitated/parodied but never equalled. I think the use of the documentary-style realism is masterful, and the fact it is low-budget makes no difference to me, in fact to me this adds to the gritty, harsh and creepy tone this film conveys. The gore is not at all excessive, in fact its count is quite low, and when it is used, it never feels cheap or gimmicky. The script is razor sharp, the story is compelling and Tobe Hooper's direction is probably Texas Chainsaw Massacre's strongest asset. I was fine with the acting as well, Leatherface is genuinely unnerving. In conclusion, a classic. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

I mean I know they're close to the house and everything, but realistically what are the chances of that.\rAll in all, I rate the movie a 9 because the whole last 40 minutes of the film are absolute torture. That's were most horror movies fail these days. You get too many breaks in between the action. This does the complete opposite of that. The first 40ish minutes of the film you get sporadic scares. Couple of shots of Leatherface killing people no biggie.\rIn the last 40 minutes $hit starts getting fu**ed up.\rIt is basically torture what you have to endure in that last part of the film. Leatherface and his disturbed family just abuse the **** out of Sally the little cute blonde girl. Even at the last second when she's barely getting away and it looks like she's gone, she can't get into the damn pickup truck and you're still gasping for air trying to not get your heart to reach 200bpm.\r(no spoilers now)\rI like to compare this movie to one of those drop of death rides in theme parks. The buildup is gold, and then the culmination of the ride is so heartrushing you can't even breathe."

There is one thing to exaggerate in order to leave a scaring harrowing impression on you to communicate the magnitude of the stakes and another to just mess with you. And yes, that is probably the reason why no matter how much you keep yourself reserved from it, this tale does get you and it is because Hooper is enjoying himself. His clear and- contrary to popular belief- clean vision is what amps up the ante of this ambitious project. This indie low budget cinema is actually an inspiring case for the newcomers out there to choose both style and substance through brilliant execution.Now coming down to the cons, it is annoyingly loud and not just the screaming but its repetitive nature that it is fixated on. It makes sure everything is double checked, it is productive but also at times irrelevant, few deaths could have been lopped off. It is more mano-y-mano than your usual horror drama, it also resembles eerily with Halloween, the concept may be shared by Hooper, but his pathos cynicism cannot be matched. To add more to its troubles, the solution of the antagonist doesn't even exist. It gets so brutally loud and poignant that you feel paralyzed to its circumstances and leaves you floating in its abyss.The performance is another weakness of it, that itches you throughout the course. Neither the frightened actors are able to express the fear nor the people on the other side of the door are dogmatic enough to give you the chills. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a mind numbing tour gone wrong case, it has its moments that stays with you, but it surely isn't something you'd be able to trade with for its unnerving psychology."

The concept of violent depravity wasn\u2019t new (Last House on the Left); the concept of backwood delinquents wasn\u2019t new (Deliverance); the concept of cannibalism wasn\u2019t new (Cannibal Holocaust). What this film did was take those taboo subjects and put them in a movie that was offensive enough to garner attention, but, at the same time, easier to play to a wider audience than the previously mentioned films. It more or less just IMPLIES, or simulates, the worst things that happen in the story so that they still happened but the film could avoid being censored. The \u201ccontroversy\u201d surrounding the film also helped push it to the mainstream, but that seems to be more of a result of this film capitalizing on the organic controversy that the previously mentioned predecessors actually garnered. The story was written in a way that when people recounted the movie to friends, it made the movie seem worse than it really plays out. In all honesty, with all respect for its influence on the genre as a whole (which is overblown), you have to really be able to drown out the constant screaming of the lead actress to enjoy the last third of the movie. Plus, the \u201csmart writing\u201d that I saw described by much more informed critics must have been from another movie since these characters seem to be on Valium; aside from the main girl, who seems to suffer from schizophrenia. Don\u2019t expect this film to be what critics play up to be. If you\u2019re looking for a real classic 70\u2019s horror movie, The Exorcist and Halloween are far and above this one, hands down."

There was no scene which made any impact except the the scene when we are first introduced to Leatherface. The pace was good and running time was also sufficient. But at this running time they could have easily made a detailed movie, which they didn't.Overall, I do not understand how this movie became so popular.
