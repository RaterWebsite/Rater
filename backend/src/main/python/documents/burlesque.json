To all you freakin' critics, you can pick all you want; most of you are so full of your own self importanc...e that you have forgotten how to enjoy a movie. Okay, so there's no groundbreaking storyline and it hints of Cabaret, Showgirls and Moulin Rouge! So what! Just suspend your belief for a couple of hours and enjoy yourself. You won't regret it! This movie is HOT! I've been in the movie business for 45 years now and very, very, very few movies have I had this much fun watching. And, that's what it's all about. Have fun, let this flick flow over you and carry you toe-tapping and cheering for a couple of hours. This is one time the ticket price is worth every penny. Did I mention? THIS MOVIE IS HOT!"

It's been done before, and it is full of clich\u00c3\u00a9s, but it gives something more different and lovable that the others don't.\r Christina Aguilera did a pretty good job in her acting debut! It doesn't scream an Oscar, but she does have a career ahead of her, I'll tell you that. Cher was just good. The entire movie was marketed with her name, but the story is barely about her. Stanley Tucci is going to give an amazing performance regardless, but he wasn't as much part of this as I think he could've been, and he was pretty much playing Nigel from The Devil Wears Prada again. Kristen Bell's character was a tad confusing, and didn't stand out as I wish she had. Cam Gigandet did an alright job, and Julianne Hough was great for her acting debut as well!\r The songs and dance numbers make this shine through. They're all so different and you cannot decide which one is the best. And the closing credits with a cover of Marilyn Manson's 'Beautiful People'? I didn't think ANYONE could pull that off. But they sure did here.\r So it's not amazing, but it's fairly enjoyable and much underrated. I recommend it!"

And the case of Burlesque is the same, the film present amazing songs, with the incredible voices of Cher and Christina Aguilera, the first thing that I think is in other musical films, like Hairspray, Joyful Noise and BandSlam, that have really awesome singers, and that is great, and the better of the movie. But the music don't create the trama, that can be like an other films, same, but in Burlesque the story is amazing, is interesting and funny, but is some large, and this little detail afect the movie. Now the rest of the cast, Kristen Bell, Stanley Tucci, Cam Gigandet, etc... have a really good [but no excellent] performances, okay, Tucci and Bell yes, but the rest of the characters be like to second plane, yeah the director intent that all have importance, but fail. Now the music, is really beautiful, I love \"You Havent Seen the Last of Me\" is a beautiful song. In no much words Burlesque is a good film, entertaining, interesting, with excellent music, good development, some good performances, and is all, a film that is good, but not excellent."

Of course Xtina's voice is jaw-dropping, but that's not the only strong point. The music is fantastic, and the dance numbers are incredible. It's jam-packed with great-looking stars in sparkling, gorgeous attire. Think \"Moulin Rouge,\" \"Chicago,\" anything Bob Fosse. Sure, it revolves around a very simple \"small town girl/big city\" narrative. But I suspect it was the individual set pieces that were really meant to shine all along. Cher, Stanley Tucci, Kristen Bell, Cam Gigandet, Julianne Hough -- the whole cast really injects some heart. I was especially surprised and impressed with Aguillera's natural ability to improvise off the actors around her. This made some of the dialog feel more spirited and fresh than I would have otherwise expected. And those songs - they really stay with you. I truly loved this movie. To quote Tucci's character, \"brava.\""

      "text": "Burlesque is a movie that falls into the musical genre with a dramatic twist. This movie was a hit for being the musical masterpiece it is. Unlike what the name suggests Burlesque is not a movie that showcases nudity or provocative dancing. This movie exceeded expectations by having a well-written plot and a perfect execution.  This movie targets people from all ages and provides a sense of motivation to achieve ones dreams by conveying the story as an impossible dream to be achieved with no resources or connections. It showcases pure talent and its ability to express feelings and get ahead in a world full of hardships. It also portrays a sense of freedom and independence that makes one thinks of their own life with a positive attitude.\rThe story follows a small town girl called Ali (played by Christina Aguilera) who decides to move into the city of Los Angles. With no experience in life this young and ambitious girl tries to find a job to help her survive. Soon after Ali loses hope having all doors shut in her face and decides to spend her last 20 dollars to pay her cover at a club that appears as a strip club on Sunset Strip.  Walking into the building, Ali is fascinated by the dancers and their performance and she immediately finds her self drown to that stage and that lifestyle. The main set of the movie is in the club and as Ali moves up in the burlesque world there are different relationships that form and break along the way.\rThe movie also features Cam Gigandet and Cher who are main characters in Ali\u2019s life. Cher is the club owner who goes by Tess.  In this musical Christina Aguilera comes out with new songs of her own and some covers of songs of Etta James and Aretha Franklin. Cher also performs songs in the movie and takes part of the burlesque show at some points. She also represents the motherly figure for Ali, as they grow closer. Being that Ali\u2019s mother died at a young age Cher provides advice with her love life and teaches Ali how to do her make up as a mother would do. As a club owner and a performer, Cher has a tough part to act. She goes through financial hardships in the movie and almost loses the club leading her to pay no attention to the motivated Ali and her amazing talent. During the movie, every time there appears to be a hardship and it seems like the club is doomed for closure, there is also hope for everything to turn around to save the club. That ties in to when the singing talent of Ali is discovered and the whole show is planned around her. However, when that fails to raise enough money and the buyers for the club are making less offers Ali finds a way to save the club by selling air rights above the building. The story about financial issues that seem unsolvable is what the audience can relate to. The way it is portrayed in the movie is realistic and unlike other movies in the same genre, talent was not the solution to this problem. Most musicals use songs as a resolution for issues because they showcase the power of music and talent in the world. In this movie singing is an expression of feelings and no matter how deep or shallow the songs are, singing was not a cure for financial problems.\rGigandet comes in as the friend who works at the bar within the club who tries to help Ali. He offers her a place to stay until she gets back on her feet. Then ends up needing her to afford his raised rent. In the beginning of the movie Cam is engaged to a different girl who is not very involved in the club scene but due to trust issues they break up. When he becomes available, Ali starts dating one of the club\u2019s usual members who is also a potential buyer. When Ali finds out about his plans to buy the club to build a strip mall she breaks up with him and becomes determined to save the club from closure. Eventually Ali and Cam are both available and they start a relationship of their own that blossom during the show and they become each other\u2019s inspiration.  Along with being a musical this movie has a love story that is not related to the music as much as it relates to the struggles in their life. Having both gone through bad relationships the songs are mainly focused on the mistakes of the past and not much on the happy relationship that unites them. However, at the end of the movie the couple deliver a song that concludes the movie.\rAnother noticeable aspect of the movie is its appeal to homosexual individuals.  By having a gay designer/stylist who works at the club this movie displays a hint of homosexuality. The designer also has the role of Cher\u2019s best friend who she turns to for advice on her personal life and money problems. He starts a relationship with another guy on the show who is not involved in the club scene. His role is not very important in the show but that attracts the homosexual audience to watch the movie. Having a same sex couple in movies increases the movie\u2019s rates and it appeals to a different community. This is a strategy that is becoming popular."

Since you already know what happens, it had better be well-mounted. On many fronts, this is. The pacing never lags, the plot is simple, the dialogue scenes are short and snappy and there's plenty of high-gloss performance. Cher gets 2 numbers, but most of the singing goes to Aguiulera, who is a knock out. If you're into this sort of thing, you'll get a glitzy gob of glamour."

The best parts of Burlesque is the song and dance numbers, the wonderful chemistry of Stanley Tucci and every actor he interacts with (especially Cher), and the occasional moment of actual romantic comedy (and there are a few, even between the young lovers).  The worst parts of Burlesque:  the no-real-conflict storyline, the criminal under-use of Alan Cumming, and the missed opportunity at having Kristen Bell's character have a real rivalry with Christina Aguilera's (or any development, for that matter).  Bell and Cumming are both tremendous musical actors, and it seems such a waste to have them in a musical where they don't get to strut their stuff.  But, when it's good, it's a pleasure.  When it's bad, it's painful."

Christina Aquilera was better than I thought she would be, and Cher - what can you say about Cher?  She's always great and seemingly ageless.  The musical numbers are what carries the film and that's where Cher and Christina shine.  Christina has her big number (a la Jennifer Hudson in Dreamgirls) towards the end, but unlike the never-ending cringe-inducing song that Jennifer sang Christina's is great.  It helps that Christina is a great singer.  The biggest problem for me was that every song was lip-synched, but it's not distracting enough to ruin the movie."

It's just gum in your hair torture finally to watch unfold the lead in for Cher's 2nd and final number - like someone threw a discarded decorative pillow haphazardly back on random couch to get it up off the floor.  Your attention to her number is rudely interrupted by the guy in your head shouting, \"O. COME. ON!!\"  There's more I suppose, but you get the point being made.  To go see this, first set your expectations.  You are going for the sole purpose of seeing a dance concert.

      "text": "Burlesque Movie Reviewby, Rajiim Gross of The RAG Review11/26/10 http://the-rag-review.info Burlesque is a film about a small town Iowa girl who has had enough of small town life. She can sing, dance and she's wasting away in her hometown. It's time for a change.....so she grabs her last pay check and buys a bus ticket to L.A. to follow her dreams. While in L.A. looking for a job as a singer / dancer she passes the Burlesque Lounge and feels enticed to enter. When she does...She decides that this is the dream job for her.  Here is my first problem. Who in their right mind is going to travel 2500  miles to get a job as a glorified go-go dancer when they have the talent of Christina Aguilera?? The character played by Christina seems like a person who knows what they want out of life but instead settles for a career as a Burlesque dancer. This character has all the real live talent of Aguilera but settles for this??? Seems a bit unrealistic!! The cast includes Cher, Christina Aguilera, Eric Dane, Cam Gigandet, Julianne Hough, Peter Gallagher, Alan Cumming, Kristen Bell"

      "text": "As a reward for straight guys who were broad-minded enough to withstand same-sex kissing and buggery among cowboys, Anne Hathaway took off her top, in what was, and still is, the gayest movie ever, hands down. Terrified of glimpsing full frontal male nudity, Hathaway's 36C breasts put the heterosexual male at ease, remasculating them for the remainder of Ang Lee's \"Brokeback Mountain\", especially the stretch run when Jack Twist(Jake Gylenhaal) tells Enis(Heath Ledger), \"I wish I knew how to quit you.\" The same broad-minded straight guys expecting the same sort of compensation for patronizing \"Burlesque\"(a musical that features not just one, but two gay icons), will be sorely disappointed. Kristen Bell, never nude, flashes some skin, but her showgirl character, a high-maintenance diva, is not that kind of showgirl, because burlesque(not to be confused with exotic dancing) is striptease with art pretensions, in which dancers tantalize the audience with mystery, so Nikki wears pasties, and Christine Aguilera's breasts are strategically covered with stage props. To add insult to injury, the only nipples we see are a dude's nipples, Cam Gigadet's nipples, and the only bared ass, Cam Gigadet's ass. Aguilera's well-documented nipple rings are left to the imagination. Playing a designer hayseed from Iowa named Ally, the clothing optional girl who likes to get \"Dirty\", as she's done throughout the course of her career, shows off her skin and pipes in equal measures, a balancing act that sells the triple threat(singer, dancer...actress?) short, when Aguilera's sex kitten image can often overshadow her aptitude for peerless vocalization,Knowing in her heart that the club patrons will value live singing more than t*ts and a*s, Ally convinces Tess(Cher, in yet another comeback) to ditch the practice of having her girls lip synch over canned music during their routines. In doing so, the contract between the filmmaker and moviegoer is breached. Normally, the audience is complicitous to the habitude of musicals, in which actors mouth the words to the accompanying song that plays over the soundtrack, but \"Burlesque\" loses its artistic license, the leeway to misrepresent reality, the very moment Ally broaches Tess over the subject of pre-recorded music. In Peter Bogdanovich's \"At Long Last Love\", actors intoned lyrics under a live boom mic while the cameras rolled, as an experiment in adding realism to the musical genre. It didn't work, but that's because the filmmaker had non-singers like Cybil Shepard, Burt Reynolds, and John Hillerman at his disposal, all of whom possessed voices which needed a liberal dose of sweetening in post-production, and then some. (Ulu Grosbard's \"Georgia\" used the same methodology to better effect.) \"Burlesque\", on the other hand, has Aguilera, who possesses a voice big enough to pull off the live thing, and yet, in the crucial moment when Ally reveals her secret weapon(it's not a vagina, that's Elizabeth Berkley's secret weapon) to the burlesque world after Nikki cuts off the music in the middle of a performance, the voice we hear is clothed, not naked as it should be. Ally's disdain for fakery makes us hyper-aware of the fact that she's doing the same thing, albeit with her own voice. After all, once it becomes obvious that \"Burlesque\" isn't going to be a softcore porn flick like Paul Verhoeven's \"Showgirls\", as a consolation prize, people will want to hear Aguilera sing, for real. Straight or gay, people aren't coming to see her act, that's for sure."

The dances were ok,  the songs too but the plot, was horrible.  I expected more from this film, more drama, more seriousness, it was all glamor and had nothing of reality."

What a mistake the critics made, who didn't give this movie 100. Yes, no violence or bloodshed and lots of sparkle. Down with the killing and up with beauty, I am sick of coming out of a movie feeling I just witness carnage on a massive scale. Bring on the sparkle and beauty of life."

It certainly is one of the most derivative, unoriginal movies I've ever seen, except for the clever end of the storyline that asks the question \"How are we going to save Cher's burlesque club?\"  But: Christina's voice is still bring-down-the-house powerful, and I bumped my rating up one entire point in gratitude for Cher's \"You Haven't Seen the Last of Me.\""

He was my favorite part of the movie, also very good looking! Great movie overall, saw it 4 times, and would love to see it again!"

Aguilera was a much better actress than I imagined, and of course her voice is amazing.  The story line was pretty predictable, yet some how still manages to be entertaining.  Not to say it's an incredible movie, but it isn't a waste of time."
