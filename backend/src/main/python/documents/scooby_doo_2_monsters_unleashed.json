      "text": "Okay, this film is better than the original, but it's still terrible. I like how they actually used original Hannah Barbera villians from the original show rather than badly cgi-ed sun-allergic creatures. Just to see the Black Knight Ghost, 10,000 Volt Ghost and Miner 49-er put a smile on my face. Also, Seth Green starred in this film. I'm a fan of the guy, especially since he's creator of Robot Chicken and starred in Buffy for 3 years. I also liked when Shaggy and Scooby encountered the Cotton Candy Glob. Matthew Lillards performance is still brilliantly spot-on But, those are the only good points The movie is quite dull, the characters aren't much like the original cartoon counterparts and we have another mystery that seems to give us more clues that appear from out of the blue. Also, I cringe at hollywoods attempts to make this film \"hip\" by adding Big Brovaz in to rap (remember them? No, me neither) At least theres no Scrappy F*cking Doo this time around This one's definately for the kids"

It didn't. \"Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed\" is one of those films that will most likely only see appeal among young children. Even if you are a fan of the classic TV show, you'll probably find the movie too silly, too poorly-written and too dull to have much appeal. If you have really young children, it wouldn't be too bad showing it to them, but you might not have as much fun as they will."

Some things work as a cartoon, but just look stupid in live action. Again, Shaggy & Scooby are the stars, doing what we all know and love. The rest of the cast  are just a mess, further distancing themselves from their characters in order to readjust to be more \"believable.\" Considering the premise of the movie, that's a bit of a joke in itself. Overall: While the movie can be a bit entertaining at times, it's poor script and silly premise just ruin it most of the time."

The plot was better, more focused, and a little more faithful to the Scooby Doo cartoons. One thing I appreciated here was that the director sensibly focused on Shaggy and Scooby, and that added to the film's charm, as nobody could resist Matthew Lilliard's goofiness as Shaggy. Sarah Michelle Gellar, Linda Cardellini and Freddie Pinze Jnr were very good too, there are some decent jokes and there were some very good action sequences. Out of the supporting cast, Seth Green was a standout as Patrick, and Alicia Silverstone is likable too. My only complaints were that one or two of the monsters could have been designed better, and also some scenes felt a bit rushed. Other than that, an enjoyable film, with an 8/10. Bethany Cox."
