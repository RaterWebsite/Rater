It's got a certain charm to it, this film in general and while its not an animated film likely to fully entertain youngish kids like Pixar films do (this film features no spoken dialogue), its pretty good - quirky, sobering, maybe even thought provoking, so yes, I'd recommend this."}], "recommendations": ["paranorman", "rango", "soul", "the_fly", "spirit_stallion_of_the_cimarron", "sucker_punch", "mowgli_legend_of_the_jungle", "ratatouille", "9", "the_croods", "paddington_2", "paprika", "peter_rabbit", "zootopia", "my_little_pony_the_movie", "the_lego_batman_movie", "atlantis_the_lost_empire", "blade_of_the_47_ronin", "cruella", "rio", "ice_age", "who_framed_roger_rabbit", "the_bfg", "shaun_the_sheep_movie", "strange_magic"]}
