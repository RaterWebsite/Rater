      "text": "This film is about hope in dark times - about making the most and standing up to your fears (characterised as an Iron Man type figure), determined for a better outlook to come.It features  some surprisingly stirring instrumental music, which is quite emotive, heightening the overall feel of scenes. It's got a certain charm to it, this film in general and while its not an animated film likely to fully entertain youngish kids like Pixar films do (this film features no spoken dialogue), its pretty good - quirky, sobering, maybe even thought provoking, so yes, I'd recommend this."
