He doesn't do anything that great in the movie that we could see him badass like Nate is in the game. Sully looks more like a new character as well a Chloe. Though the movie picks a lot of eferences and background from other chracaters in the game franchise including the comics. The antagonists are uncharismatic, uninteresting and some of them you easily forgets as the movie goes on. There's nothing really great in the movie"

I did read in previous reviews that it reminded people a lot of National Treasure and I very much agree. There were moments in the moment that were predictable or made me roll my eyes but come on, it's a video game movie. I expected a number of those. I would recommend seeing this to my friends looking for something fun to watch. Be sure to stay for an after credit or two. Side note, not sure if anyone else noticed Rotten Tomatoes sensors the users scores on this movie. Throttling reviews. Which made me come here instead."

      "text": "Based off the hit Playstation video game series, Tom Holland stars as treasure hunter Nathan Drake, who teams up with Victor Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) to find a lost stash of treasure that Nate's missing brother went searching for, all while trying to outrace a wealthy and powerful businessman (Antonio Banderas) from getting to it first. While I never really played the games at all, I still found myself looking forward to this one, as it appeared to be a pretty fun adventure flick worth passing the time for, and sure enough, it delivers on the entertainment factor just fine, even if it gets a little ridiculous and over-the-top with the action at times. Furthermore, Holland and Wahlberg make for a great and oftentimes witty and amusing duo. Their chemistry and teamwork was easily my favorite part of the film. The action is quite entertaining throughout as well, and storywise, it gets the job done well enough despite being a little cliche and 'been there, done that', as well as having a frustrating cliffhanger of a mid-credits scene. But overall, it's a fun and passable enough action flick, even if you're not too familiar with the games or have never even played them."

For a big treasure chasing adventure movie it actually looks abit cheap & the set piece scenes are underwhelming until they finally do go big & it's just brain dead stupid. Antagonists are incredibly forgettable & leave no mark on the audience whatsoever. If you asked me their names now i couldn't tell you, the antagonists in the movie are one of its weakest points & actually include a plot twist that makes things even worse in that area.However there is no denying Tom Holland's ability as a leading man, he certainly produces charisma in spades which is lucky as Mark Whalberg is a charisma vacuum. Who knows Tom Holland's star power might draw a sequel but all i was left with was a feeling of a missed opportunity of what could of been."

They're off to recover a lost treasure, while dealing with several people who are also after it with much comic repartee. The chemistry between the 2 leads is passable, but the dialogue never gives them much chance to explore it. Interestingly, Wahlberg was originally supposed to play the younger role, but time took its toll, so Holland shows off his newly-pumped torso 3 times, while Wahlberg dons a tank top. As for the adventure aspects, anyone who's willing to accept the absurdly improbable plot will have lots of action scenes to take their minds off the implausibility of it all (unless you rely on video game logic). The pace never lags and some of the visuals are grand,\u00a0 but the whole thing feels forced and hokey. NOTE: Stay thru the early credits for one final scene that sets up the sequel."

The one time I most definitely smirked was when a cast member made a cameo. What this film lacks is that in the video games there was always a plot twist in the final chapter/act such as the truth behind Drake's mission and him doing some thinking for his own to put an end to the mutiny, making me nickname Nathan Drake \"Nothin' Muckrake.\" Another flaw that this movie has is the pasting of environments from the games and the movie not originating a set that feels like I'm re-watching a cutscene from one of the games.To top it off, this film is like a summer blockbuster released in February that is enjoyable to sit through but concerned about the story."

Ok the Uncharted are very exaggerated but not to this point.The actors are good but Tom Holland plays Spiderman at times and making Nate so clumsy and very annoying.The special effects are good but there are a few not-so-great moments.The moment in the city reaches a terrible moment with shots and actions everywhere for several minutes, and people don't react, the police never come, it's totally nonsense.It's a very average movie and even if you take it as an action movie, it's very far from being a good action movie. A film which wanted to make Marvel but which did not succeed because not the same universe, no character known to the general public.And they took Tom Holland for one reason...the girls. There were a lot of girls in the room, at least 70%, who were screaming at certain passages in the film. We can clearly see that the actor was chosen to bring in a female audience. And when you choose an actor for that, it's because you don't trust your film or because you knew that if you didn't, you wouldn't get as many admissions to the cinema."

      "text": "Uncharted benefits quite a lot from the charisma brought by Tom Holland. Which is more than positive considering that he is the face of the film, but it's worth noting that this is basically the most important thing he can offer to this role, mostly because the script doesn't give him elements to prove otherwise. It's too early to say that as an actor he doesn't have much range, but Cherry was not a good showcase for him in that regard, and in The Devil All the Time with only one scene. Robert Pattinson completely devoured him.Uncharted is a film that tries in every way to be fun.It tries to be expansive, it tries to be and feel really big, and even though I really didn't want to mention this, because the film doesn't have to look like the video game, the video game itself has an aura the film simply can't replicate.I think the casting outside of Holland and Mark Wahlberg was pretty bad.Antonio Banderas gets completely squandered as one of the villains, while Tati Gabrielle completely lacks the credits and skills to be the real villain the film required.I was basically watching her do the same thing she did in the Sabrina show for Netflix.Acting cheeky and seductive just doesn't cut it. Even for this story.And Sophia Ali share's no chemistry with Holland. The main strengths of this tale lie in its action sequences, and some of them are pretty great, but they don't quite make up for its biggest gaps. The narrative feels completely made as it goes along, and while it's well known that a film like this doesn't need a big plot, you can't offer something so thin either. The problem here isn't that it doesn't offer entertainment, because it does, and for some people that will more than enough, but to me it felt like a soulless entertainment, that lacks wit, charm and spirit.Uncharted feels empty, despite its visual spectacle. Which upon completion will leave no lasting impression."

Mark Walberg was also great, although I get a different vibe from his Sully than the one in the games. Admittedly it could have been better for sure. The villains were a pretty cliche at times, and I wanted to hear more of the uncharted theme music because it's the best. But overall it was great fun, and I'd watch it again.

Wahlburg as Sully on the other hand acted nothing (and looked nothing) like the original character but still pulled through a solid performance. I also really liked the actress who played Chloe, she definitely brought the Chloe vibe from the games. The set pieces were great and the action overall was to notch as could be expected from a blockbuster production like this. This definitely could have been better though, and people coming into this expecting a very loyal adaption of the games might leave a bit disappointed.
