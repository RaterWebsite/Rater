This is ridiculous. This movie was very funny. Although definitely at times a kid movie, it was still hilarious for adults. Adam Sandler does his normal comedy routine, with a mix of several different stories. I watched this with one of my best friends, we're both in our mid twenties, and we both found it to be very funny. The comedy? Very funny and for adults. The plot, romance, and serious moments? Definitely for children (corny) This deserves at least a 6, and for a children's movie at least an 8. Im giving it a 10 to offset what I believe is a very unfair low score. Id watch this a second time, no problem."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Easily one of the most overrated movies of the year."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Marty Feldman died in 1982 at the age of 49. \"Bedtime Stories\" pays homage to the bug-eyed comic actor by displacing Feldman's signature feature onto a guinea pig. This lame, alleged comedy shares with Darren Aronofsky's misunderstood \"The Fountain\", a diegesis informed by the laws of Buddhism, as evidenced by the rodent with Marty Feldman eyes. Reincarnation( the recycling of souls) is an eastern belief that finds puerile expression in \"Bedtime Stories\", when Skeeter Bronson(Adam Sandler) and the people from his current life appear together, over and over again, across different epochs in time. The same story, boy proves his love for girl through the performance of a heroic deed, gets recycled for its timelessness. Regardless of genre, the story works. \"Bedtime Stories\" posits storytelling as Buddhist in nature, after all, each story has been told before in some other form. It has structural similarities: a formula. People are recycled. Plots are recycled. \"Bedtime Stories\" performs an alchemy on the imagination by recasting Buddhism as an avenging god who killed all the Greek muses. If this commingling of disciplines(religion and the arts) had an origin story, a bedtime story, ahem, it would have film theorist Robin Wood writing his article on genre theory(\"Ideology, Genre, Auteur\") under a bodhi tree. In one scene, \"Bedtime Stories\" seems to refute Christianity as the film practices its religion by recycling Paul Thomas Anderson's frogs in \"Magnolia\". This time it's gumballs; this time it's not a miracle. The gumball sequence shows how every miracle can be undermined by a logical explanation. While the film challenges the hegemony of the dominant ideology, it doesn't change the fact that the story itself is tired and worn out, you know, recycled. Maybe god is a truly original screenplay. Maybe god doesn't exist."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Adam Sandler seems he is the comedy king who will do anything, whether the script is good or not, he takes it; This is probably the rare \"Bust\" movie that was developed by Disney pictures. Oh, it even fails as a kids movie. Defining a kid movie, in age, is about 4-9, maybe age 10. But i can only say this would only become a \"wow\" to a 1 year old. This is Disaster Movie all over again, except its little kid friendly, but yet it fails. Maybe it's the lack of creativity, or maybe it's so unrealistic that we can't seem to put it to our imagination. The only good thing about this movie is if you (i am talking to ages 6+) have a hard time falling asleep, \"BEDTIME STORIES\" kicks in. So, the positives? [really the negatives] 1. It makes you fall asleep BORING 2. Audience 10+ will get great laughs from the werid plot and script, seriously, if you want REALLY REALLY GOOD LAUGHS (not the good ones in critisim), then..... watch this Weird, unthinkable, Illegal for all ages movie. Illegal for all ages means a movie is so bad, but it can be good if you want a laugh."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "Appallingly bad - I don't even know what to say."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Imaginative, as well as disappointing. They could have done a lot more with the story. Adam Sandler displays his usual inane not very funny style of humor. Some good effects, expectantly fine production from Disney. Overall, it's fair."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This was an enjoyable family movie. My son loved the much maligned Bugsy. It was nice to see, for once, a pretty CLEAN kids movie.

This film is a gem."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "That the critics panned this movie doesn't surprise me. I have mental block whenever I try to imagine a movie critic laughing.

The overused \"divorced mom\" sideplot was a unnecessary and the ending was somewhat bland, but Adam Sandler was really fun to watch throughout (wow, did I really just say that?), and the blending of fantasy and reality was shockingly restrained, and all the better for that."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "An enjoyable Adam Sandler movie, much, much better than his previous 2008 movie, Zohan.

Grade A- ................................................."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Adam Sandler HAS made some trash in his time but, annoyingly, sometimes, he'll make one that's pretty good and the critics still hate it. This and Pixels are his two best movies. It's really funny and features lots of the one-liners and witty comebacks we've come to expect from Sandler. This is proof that he's not a bad actor or anything. He's a talented guy in search of a good script. Sadly, the critics bash him no matter what. This may sound like a kids-only movie but there are plenty of subtle jokes to entertain adults too. Funny film, very enjoyable."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This movie made me remember about my childhood days.

Adam Sandler's greatest low. I'm still gonna give it a 1 only because it can provide some fun if you write down every overused story element ever before watching and play 'Clich\u00e9 Bingo\".

The acting was mostly good even though it wasn\u2019t perfect. The special effects were not good at all. Everything that was a special effect looked fake. The story was mediocre but fun.
