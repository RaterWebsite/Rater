It doesn't do anything new for that genre, but thanks to a tight plot and an excellent lead in Neeson it's a top-notch addition to the genre.\r Most movies based off of novels have brief sections where something a character does makes little sense because the explanation behind it which was in the source material didn't make it into the movie due to time constraints. That isn't the case here. It's one of those rare cases where everything feels perfectly fleshed out.\r A few familiar tropes of the genre are present (a retired cop becoming a detective after a past mistake on the force caused him to hang up his badge), but they don't detract from the overall experience. This is a dark, grisly thriller that I think is sure to please. An excellent book to film adaption.\r My total score for the movie is a 9.9/10."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Very good thriller reminiscent of 70's films like 'Bullet' or 'Death Wish'. Anyone expecting Liam Neeson to deliver another 'Taken' style of action film might be disappointing themselves as this one likes to spend time building the scene before showing action. The director for this film did a great job in leading the viewer with lots of visuals leading you to notice or think something throughout the whole picture. This also has some gruesome violence so I would not take the kids to see this one as it is well deserving of is rated \"R\" rating."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "For an investigative thriller, it does a fantastic job at keeping the audience tense and afraid of what happens next. The acting is also great, but in particular, the two stars stand out; Liam Neeson is the classic Liam Neeson - gritty, serious, with a touch of dry humour, and Brian \"Astro\" Bradley (TJ, in the movie) also does a surprising job at playing a homeless side-kick.\rThe visuals are also well-done, however, they may bore some. The movie is very gray, creating a dull atmosphere, which fits the movie perfectly, but isn't really appealing to everyone.\r The movie is a solid 7/10. Some flaws here and there, but overall, if you can stomach a disturbing thriller, A Walk Among the Tombstones is a great Liam Neeson film."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Despite its length and glacial pacing, \"A Walk Among The Tombstones\" still maintains the viewer's interest with a solidly subtle performance from Liam Neeson and some thrilling subject matter throughout."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Getting tired of these movies that portray Liam Neeson as an \"Ex-Cop from New York\", I mean sure \"A Walk Among the Tombstones\" is different than \"Taken\" and \"Non Stop\", but come up with another back story or at least get a different actor.

This movie started off strong with a good premise with a lot of potential to be a tense mystery movie, which slowly went nowhere with bland dialogue and poor pacing with some dull acting all around. The film had some good scenes which broke up the boredom throughout but overall left me wanting more, one of the flaws being that they reveal who is behind the murders around half way through, so it loses all appeal to those wanting a murder mystery movie such as myself. Overall i would say that this movie is okay if you want to watch something to switch off and watch as a straight drama with not much new to offer."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "forgettable, lifetime movie. a couple of good scenes. there are two scenes of violence against women and children which were pretty nasty, other than that, its a generic movie."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "If you are a Liam Neeson fan: \"Then you will enjoy this movie\".

The film is very well directed and written, Director Scott Frank did an awesome job with this feature and I want to see it 20 times more. AWATT is a gritty, awesome and excellent thriller that deserves a watch, even if it's for Liam Neeson."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "A walk amoung the tombstones is a satisfying  crime drama. Liam Neeson actually moves away from his usual taken character to given a more human performance while also no losing that badass side of him. As for the rest of the film its about average. Some characters like the kid and one of the murderers give convincing performances while others just feel thrown in. My biggest issue that makes me like other crime dramas like prisioners more than this is there really isn't any big villain reveal. It might seem like it when their identities are hidden in scenes but  half way in they just are like screw it show who they are, killing the suspense and mystery. The movie is brutal so at times I was on the edge of my seat. Though its not the next prisoners or silence in the lamb, its still an average fun movie that might convince you Liam Neeson can do more than just play a taken like character."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "I don't know where to begin in describing just what a bore and snooze fest is the film called A WALK AMONG THE TOMBSTONES.

And then there is hulking Liam Neeson slogging through it all. Stay away. Be warned. Unless a really good long nap."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I enjoyed this very well-made thriller, thanks to Liam Neeson, an excellent supporting cast, a very good, complex script (a real mystery), and also very good, clear direction. Complex and convincing, the film moved along without being overly brutal and sadistic. There was just enough of the murders in close-up and mainly shown not in body parts but through frightened eyes that made this film work and raised it a cut (no pun intended) above the others in this genre. This is a thriller that gives a real feeling of horror, without being too graphic, along with a genuine feeling of sadness and sympathy for Scudder, the main character, but also for the victims.."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "A solid investigative thriller that while it may be slow it keeps you interested throughout.

It makes me think of what would have been had my favourite actor ever, James Cagney, hadn't basically retired for the quiet life in the early 60's, when the perfect storm of 'great actors in B-movies' hit the fans.\r My lady is more a horror aficionado, and of recent vintage films, so it was nice to throw this on for a spin and show her its neo-noir tendencies, almost as if going through a 'make your own movie' template, checking them off one-by-one. I don't mind that sort of rote predictability if it's done right, and, though heavily flawed, for the most part it does. By the climax, I basically only cared for four things: that the kidnapped girl, Matthew Scudder and TJ were alive, and that the two kidnappers/murderers got their just desserts, whether it be lengthy incarceration or murder, anything so their crime spree would be ended. The film was well-made and a very enjoyable experience, so considering the relatively minor flaws (especially the one-dimensional aspect of the antagonists), I would definitely recommend at least a watch for most cinephiles out there, especially those interested in 'true crime' type of contemporary American cinema."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This movie is really good and just like taken I loved it and im excited about hopefully seeing a sequel soon because it seriously was sick.

It is stylishly made with a tense story that is also fun. It effectively builds up to some good old fashioned fighting scenes."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Played like a period drama more than an ex-cop drama.\rLiam Nesson was alright, I thought The Grey was better than this. He had the predictable one liners like \"I'm not negotiating with you\" and multiple killings.\rWatch it on Netflix, Amazon Prime, or if you must, Redbox. Not worth a buy."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "\"A walk among tombstones\"  comes over as a failed tango:  it limps and stumbles from the outset. Its biggest flaw is also its strongest and only asset : Liam Neeson. Liam Neeson is a great actor  but he has to play against...himself and only himself. And this then is the sad truth really, for all the other actors feel like extras even though an attempt is made to couple the young Astor(?) with him. An attempt that mostly fails because of its obvious cheesy aspect and failure of giving the relation any sufficient depth.\rWhile there is no reason to suppose that a story requires two or more people to make it work, it is not easy to pull it off. I have a hard time trying to recall a movie that has just one central figure in it and nobody else.\rLiam thus dominates every scene and he doesn't bore, but it is a talent wasted in a movie that doesn't put him up against a great adversary or gives him a brilliant sidekick.  If I hold it up against a movie like the Maltese Falcon,\rBogart is up against the likes of a Syndney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre. And Mary Astor makes for a great femme fatale. In Bladerunner Ford spars with Rutget Hauer, Sean Young, the latter who might not be a great actor, but was the right person at the right place. And in the Silence of the Lambs, Foster and Hopkins make the movie.\rLiam has nobody that remotely helps him make the movie. Hence the movie is nothing but an okay movie, with some flaws and silly turns, but lacking that essential human interaction that makes a movie greater. The point to learn is that a movie is perhaps like a tango."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "A better film than expected. It is nothing great, new or groundbreaking. We\u00b4ve seen it many times before.

Since Taken he has been involved in several action films like the A-team, Non-Stop and now two sequels to Taken. This role displays his serious side where he portrays a deep character that doesn't have to kill everyone he comes in to contact with in order to entertain the audience. These are the movies that Neeson should be doing now that he is well over 60 years old. Brian Astro Bradley also showed off some acting chops as Neesons young \"associate\". Astro made a name for himself being a contestant on the X factor but it looks like he may have a promising career in acting. A Walk Among the Tombstones is a great crime film. It really doesn't make you think too hard but it still has some shock value. This movie is certainly one of the underrated 2014 films."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "This movie was a bit slow and thriller-like considering Liam Neeson is the main character playing a retired cop now private detective. He is a skilled and occasionally dynamic actor so this did not step out of his abilities. There was less hard nosed punch and shoot action than I expected. When Liam's character is asked to track down two demented killers who make drug dealers widowers he steps into more than he bargained for. The cast was well picked and well defined. The plot was not terribly complicated and coupling that with so many different characters and moving pieces sort of mashed it up a bit. There was a lot of weight put on the horrible killers but even to the end it is not all that clear why they did what they did and where they came from in the first place and why it is so important that they be stopped as opposed to other criminals Liam could be being paid to chase. Kind of trivializes things. Overall a cruel bloody tale of bad guys and who ever is not quite bad enough to be a bad guy. Liam Neeson carried dignity and grit as he always does. But I think this movie overextended its relevance in certain scenes, and didn't glaze it with enough action and/or pretty women to make you not notice. If you're a Liam fan like me, give it a try, if not, maybe worth a watch for free at the most."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "I thought this movie was dreary and boring.

But he isn't a New York City guy.  He doesn't look like a New York City guy and he doesn't sound like one either.  And, OK, the NYPD is probably the most diverse organization to be found anywhere on Earth, but if you're showing me a NYC cop--active duty or not--he probably looks more like Chris Noth than Liam Neeson.\r Problem #2:  the teenage computer whiz sidekick.  Maybe this worked in novels published in 1992 but in movies made in 2014, movies that appear styled like they're supposed to be hardboiled or hardcore & gritty, the whiz kid sidekick just seems silly.\r Problem #3:  this is one of those movies in which from time to time a character announces something and I'm left wondering how the hell did he figure that out.  But maybe I wasn't paying close enough attention when the microfilm was flashed on the screen.  Maybe I'm an idiot.  Or maybe the screenwriter and/or director decided to take a short cut.\r Problem #4:  For some reason I've got this idea like Russian gangsters and big-time drug traffickers are really hard dudes.  You know, like, you kidnap his wife or his kid and he will kill everybody in New York City who comes between himself and retribution.  You call him on the phone to tell him where to deliver the ransom money and he'll spend the entire phone call telling you about all the horrible ways he's going to torture you before he finally kills you with his own bare hands.  Because he's not going to pay you.  He doesn't care who you kidnap or who you murder.  He's going to get you and he won't stop until he does.

The villains in the film are just the worst human beings on the face of the earth. There where creepy people and overall terrible people.

It's not like a Saturday night movie: for starters it is really violent at times, unless thats how you like to spend your weekend nights; then go cray!\r Ok the bad: I'm willing to forgive Arnold having his Austrian accent peppering everything, but his movies are dumb fun. So you let it go. But Liam Neeson as an NYC cop? No way. He just isn't that believable as one. But you can put that aside, sorta. Then there are the weird musical cues that come out of nowhere. Happy music! Sad music! Creepy! It all doesn't make sense. The villains are great villains, but they are hollow and come out of nowhere.\r All this isn't to say you shouldn't see though.
