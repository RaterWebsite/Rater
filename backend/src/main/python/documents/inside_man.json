But I thought it was one of the clumsiest movies I've seen in a long time. No energy, momentum, style. The script was anemic and corny. I'm not sure how this film was supposed to translate. As suspense it failed because it telegraphs everything in advance. It has a distracting sublot with a nazi sympathizer that is based on an ubelievable premise. It also has too many A-list actors like Jodie Foster and Christopher Plummer doing small parts that are little to work with and that is something I always find distracting. I'm not trying to be a hater, but I really disliked this movie and am taking the time to write this because I disliked it so much."

We see Spike's usual M.O. on display throughout the film, which basically amounts to making caucasians feel guilty about...well being caucasians. Spike Lee was in way over his head on this one. Case in point...Lee is the only dolt transparent enough to cast Jodie Foster as a manipulative power broker (who's white of course since white=manipulative in Spike Lee joints) then proceed to name the character Ms. White. Even the overt racial sarcasm falls flat as his breathless pursuit of half cocked social commentary drags this sophomoric production down to the abyss of most forgettable films of all time."

The masterful Denzel, even more so than with \"Man On Fire,\" is swimming upstream here and Clive Owen better think of a way to add some vulnerability to his hardass act soon because it's wearing thin. There is some really painful dialog as our heros dissassociate from the grave danger threatoning fifty human lives, and, while Spike himself doesn't appear, there is scene after scene featuring talentless people demonstrating his acting technique of very nearly winking directly into the camera."

      "text": "No one can deny that this movie has a great cast. The acting is terrific. The directing is classic Spike Lee--brilliant at times, but he takes every chance to work in commentary about race, religion and ethnicity. All in all, this movie presents a good picture and the plot depicts what would be a brilliant heist if it were true. However, there are serious flaws in the plot (which are gracefully glossed over by expert acting), but the end result is that we really don't know the various character's motivations for their behavior. At one point we are told by one of the theives \"I did it for the money\", but that doesn't seem to add up with what was taken. Similarly I'm still trying to figure out exactly what motivated Denzel to bring Jodie a telephone number in one of the last scenes. The sequence of the movie is expertly executed to both provide hints and keep you guessing. Denzel's character is likeable, funny and feels real. Jodie Foster's character is a bit unbelievable in terms of profession. Oh, and keep an eye out for the Albanian woman. I thought she was excellent."

The writing of Denzel Washington's character is often ridiculous; and he works valiently to overcome it. The only real entertainment value for me were the unintential (I assume) moments of camp; notably, the telephone scene between Denzel and his girlfriend; and the bizarre performance from Jodie Foster, who seems to be trying to channel Ann Coulter! Foster's attempts at being cool and cunning come off as simply laughable. I'm not sure how Christopher Plummer kept a straight face in his scenes with her. For me, only Foster's performance fiasco made this film worth my viewing time. And why was Willem Dafoe's participation needed here? I used to believe Spike was good film director, but a poor screenwriter. After seeing \"Inside Man.\" I now have my doubts about his skills as a director. I think most of the \"names\" signed on for the money."

Unnecessary social commentary inserted into useless waste of time scenes (at one point, denzel instructs a low level patrolman not to use ethnic slurs and the bank robber owen tries to steer a child away from playing a violent video game, lame for a supposed heist movie) jodie foster's character was useless and the acting belonged in \"mean girls\". If you're looking for a plot with standard rising action/climax/falling action don't expect any from this film. Yes I understand the ending but that doesn't mean that it was clever or interesting. Over half of the theater waited throughout the entire ending credits with a desperate hope that they would eventually get there money's worth and a portion of the plot would be seen to completion. no such luck. Loose ends are everywhere from the role of clive owen's fellow bank robbers to how the robbers got all of their information to how they were at all connected to Case. Although Denzel's observation that \"this ain't no bank robbery\" is correct, I was disappointed with the \"deep\" and \"complex\" conspiracy that for some reason involved the mayor of new york, although his character seemed unaware of even his own role halfway through the movie"

      "text": "Lee, for one, is long beyond his days as a civic provocateur and voice for the radical social world. Like John Singleton, he may have found his legs as a pulp manufacturer whose least arguable claim to fame is that he can do fast, funny, attitudinal genre films better than Tony Scott. Washington and Foster, for their parts, are merely dukes in a sick kingdom, taking what roles they're offered for people their age (and sex) just to keep their careers afloat in the public brain-pan. Lee is playing the genre like a board game, and his film is a sniggering riff, filled with hyperbolic New York stereotypes, sexist jokes, puns, scattershot commentary on racial profiling and smug banter. As bogus in its way as Richard Donner's 16 Blocks, Inside Man has an even more irritating disrespect for the verities of police work and for the emotional life of urban Americans. There are a few rousing achievements on the table, in particular a comical police debate--instigated by a faux riddle tossed by Owen, about trains, U.S. currency and Grand Central Station--as well as a fast joke involving a Sikh hostage who, outraged by profiling, acknowledges that yes, he can easily hail a cab in Mid-Eastern-cabbie-saturated New York. But heist films are hardly what they used to be; for decades, they were a vehicle for postwar desperation and fatalism, and today the genre has an empty tank of frisson to offer without film noir's acknowledgment of doom. The difference between, say, Stanley Kubrick's 1956 masterpiece The Killing and contemporary daydreams like Inside Man is the difference between a luckless hell on earth and a dull weekend in the Poconos."

Now it seems that everyone from critics to casual movie goers have been willing to excuse this movie solely based on the great cast. Which would have been understandable, had the acting itself not been the greatest weakness of this pretentious mess. Washington gives one of the worst performances of his career here, playing a sarcastic know-it-all cop who is annoyingly juvenile and devoid of any compelling thoughts or emotions.i.e., he and his partner stare at a female victim's large chest while interogating her, making light of her emotions. (this is supposed to be funny) Foster is also terrible playing a mysterious liason with her own agenda. Dafoe is miscast as a clueless police captain. Owen is the only exception here, suffering through an under-developed role. The movie is ruined by random attempts at comedy, both intentional and unintentional, which ruins any suspense or tension that might have helped it. THE BOTTOM LINE: A pretentious hollywood film that trys to pass itself off as an updated Dog Day Afternoon, but instead feels more like a failed comedy with an A-list cast."

The soundtrack was amazing and fit well in the movie. The actors were well placed, and were great at their job.\r Clive Owen's ego and personality really fits the character \"Dalton Russel\" as explained. Denzel Washington also did a fantastic job of \"Detective Keith Frazier.\" Overall the actors of this movie really had a place and knew what they were doing.\r If you are looking for an action-packed, somewhat comedic, and suspense-filled movie, you should really check out \"Inside Man.\" Spike Lee has outdone himself on this one, as it is a well put together film that is sure to please you. It is rated 'R' so be careful who watches it. Overall great movie."

Top it all off with a resolution that leaves more questions than answers and you have a film that is hard to recommend. To Spike Lee's credit, he can be confident and inventive director, but he still goes for \"film student gimmickry\" when the film would have been better served with more restraint and a tighter focus on the narrative. \"Inside Man\" is entertaining enough as a popcorn flick, but there are better films more deserving of your time."

It's about the volatile showdown between a determined cop and a perfectionist bank robber is sent spiraling toward disaster when a scheming power broker steps in to take control of the situation in this hair-raising heist flick directed by Spike Lee and starring Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, and Jodie Foster. Dalton Russell (Owen) is a bank robber with a difference. In his quest to execute the perfect heist, Dalton has taken every possible factor into consideration. Dalton's uncanny ability of staying one step ahead of the law thwarts even-tempered Detective Keith Frazier's (Washington) best efforts. But there's another factor at play. The bank president (Christopher Plummer) has requested the services of high-profile negotiator Madeline White (Foster). Despite her commendable track record, Madeline is something of a wild card, and before the day is over, this bank robbery will go down in history as one of the most elaborate heists ever executed. Inside Man's plot is exciting, and the acting by Washington, Owen, and Foster all have a stellar performance of their own. I couldn't have liked it more."
