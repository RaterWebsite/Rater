I think we're starting to see this in the work of Tina Fey.  Of course Fey did not write or direct this movie which explains the utter dreck we see before us.  The question then begs:  Why?  Let's hope this isn't the start of a complete sell out."

When their parents decide to sell their home, the girls travel back to clean out their rooms, but not before one final blowout. The flick is all about the snappy banter that bounces effortlessly between them, thanks to SNL writer Paula Pell, who manages to capture their style with sassy ease. There are some cheap shots and obvious gags, but the witty comments make them amusing. It\u2019s a lot of it\u2019s fun until about half way thru the big bash, when the mayhem stops building and just gets silly. Still, if you like these women and their comic chemistry (plus a healthy helping of enjoyable supporting characters), you won\u2019t be disappointed."

Those two ladies have amazing chemistry, and the supporting cast is incredible.  Just go see it!"

I was not disappointed as they were an excellent comedy duo once again in this hilarious story of two sisters with contrasting personalities. It's a comedy, so you should expect really silly dumb even unreasonable stuff to laugh at. It's also a movie, so of course it's going to be dramatic. Go into it with an open mind and you'll see the plot even has a solid heartfelt message! I 100% recommend this movie to anyone who is looking to go out and relax and have a good time. It will leave you laughing, both guys and girls as my entire theatre was in an uproar the whole time!"

This is not a good film, in fact, it\u2019s one of the worst films Ive seen in a very long time. The chemistry and talents of Ms. Fey and Ms. Poehler deserve a better vehicle to display the obvious abilities these two ladies possess. What makes the situation even worse is that the entire film is an insult, not only to them but to the viewers who expected and were entitled to much more.\rSlapstick comedy, even badly executed slapstick comedy, has its place but crudeness without humor does not. Adding to the tumult and artistic anarchy are James Brolin and Diane Wiese who play the parents of the two sisters but, try as they may, they just aren't comic actors and their efforts fail as does the rest of the endeavor. The film is a disappointment to the viewers and demeaning to the performers which I guess sums up the whole  experience. I give the film a 1 rating and that is for Ms. Poehler who, in spite of it all, is the only person worth watching in this 98 minutes of theatrical discomfort."

Sisters is their newest collaboration and this film could have been so much better. Fey and Poehler's friendship behind the camera certainly contributed to good chemistry in front of it and they do provide some pretty solid laughs here and there but there are a lot of random jokes that are terrible. I found the supporting cast of characters to be really funny and at some points they were funnier than the two stars. I know I'm not really the target audience but I just didn't laugh as much as I would have liked. The other major issue that I had with this movie is that it is a movie that did all it needed to do in 90 minutes but its two hours. I'm not completely writing Sisters off because it may be considered funny to other people but I didn't like it as much as I thought I would."

      "text": "Tina Fey and Amy Poehler \"the female duo most fun on the world\"  return in a sisters comedy,  dissolving their attitudes to perfection in their different characters.\r Recently, in the cinematographic world, much is had speculated and decreed against the few opportunities in this big world of cinema for women in terms of roles, directors, producers and other jobs in the production of a film. The averages are alarming: 30,9% characters with lines of dialogue are women.19,7% are screenwriters, 22,7% producers and 6,8% are directors.  The reality is disturbing inequality of the feminine gender in this topic. Slowly, This fades with celebrities as striking as Melissa McCarthy ('Spy' - 'Ghostbusters (2016) '), Amy Schumer that breaks the stereotypes in any film or the same Tina Fey and Amy Phoeler ('Sisters') this  project written by a woman. The impact of this discrimination is imminent, programming ideas with women everywhere, something similar with what you want to achieve with the race of color after problems with the Academy Awards (#OscarSoWhite).\rThis work ('Sisters') demonstrates  the domain and extreme capacity that may have a woman in the world of the cinema comedy or any other genre.\r These two women come into their comfort zone to give us a story written by Paula Pell ('SNL'), centered at a crazy party carried out by last time in their childhood home.  Despite the poor and immature script, Amy and Tina manage to offer the best of them through a childish material. \"Sisters\" possesses a very striking face for marketing, stimulating to give a chance, said marketing worked relatively outstanding, reflected at the box office against its strong imposing (18, December, 2015),\r \"Sisters\" premiere without fear of his powerful enemy \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" providing a good alternative to (strange beings) who don't like lightsaber battles or the trio of Chipmunks doing mischief  \"Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip\".\r The characters which turns the story is Kate (Tina Fey) a girl disorganized, insurgent, unable to keep a job and totally promiscuous,  while Maura (Amy Poehler) is a nurse, divorced, wanting to live a crazy night and with a personality that is radically different from that of her sister.\r Parents of them, (Dianne Wiest and James Brolin) strangely, do not form essential part of the project, instead of this, they spend has be secondary characters due to the low integration within the film.\r Without a doubt, the film takes shape as soon as start \"Ellis Island\", a development lasting mostly throughout the film, an interesting preamble for an interesting progress. With some reminiscences of the Judd Apatow's comedies (Trainwreck) but better quality, Fey throws her best powers during the two long hours, much more than in her entire career, while Amy in the same way that gives its most eccentric touch to this story full of humour.\r The cast is completely fun and exciting, as a surprising John Cena already had seen in \"Daddy's Home\", Rachel Dratch, Bobby Moynihan, Kate McKinnon and others. Personally, I emphasize the interpretation of my friend John Leguizamo, seeing that a Latino - American has a chance at the American Film Company, and what better way that making his \"Ellis Sandwich\" with so famous, beautiful and talented Phoeler and Fey.\r All the comedy is so fun and caricature, which even more beyond the scenes loaded with oral elements (phrases and others) the face film is a simple and inexpressive funny scene from a complication of pronunciation that it not only shakes the audience, but up to the own cast.\r The introductory parts are well known, guests of the past, find people that environmental party, buy the necessary elements for the meeting, and a funny scene at the clothing store that burst of laughter even to the more serious (This scene, a key point of its classification R)\r As seen in the film's behind of scenes, the fun and excitement that the actors and actresses felt tremendously reflection on the product that the public saw. The stars duo performed one of their best work to date on the big screen but overcoming never done on small screen."

That's where everyone's are wrong and expresses their disappointment. For me it was a nice comedy, but not comparable with other great ones. It might won't work on teenagers, but there's no issue for adults with the open mind to enjoy it. A part themed movie for the grown-ups.\r From the director of 'Pitch Perfect' another woman oriented comedy. Both, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler were not that funny, hence not a rocking combo, but did not fail either and worked okay on this. They are the sisters with the opposite character. When they visit their childhood home, they decide to throw one final party before handing it over to the new owners.\r John Cena's cameo was excellent. In this chick movie he's the only one who gave manly appeal compared with the other men. The story was decent, but most of the movie was a regular party that goes wild. So expecting development of the characters or the story is silly. What I meant was, it is an entertainer, not a biopic or a documentary, so it delivers its purpose.\r 7/10"

Although, this movie wasn't awesome it was still a pretty fun time. It doesn't work too well as a comedy mainly this is sadly due to the fact that a lot of the funniest parts were in the trailer. But there is still enough substance for you to not feel completely robbed. This is obviously a given but Tiny and Amy's chemistry together was so believable and real that you don't feel like you are watching characters interact and humans instead. The comedic timing was a bit off. There are times where certain scenes were stretched out to such an extent that the punchline/joke just became annoying. There is one running gag that really annoyed me and it involved one of their friends from their childhood thinking he's funny and he kept making these painfully bad jokes. I usually love awkward humor but it just felt a little forced. But is this movie funny? That's the biggest question, will you laugh throughout this movie. Yeah, I had a good time with this movie and was bursting out laughing at times. In the end, Sisters was a good time! Some of the jokes feel flat and when they do, they do really hard. But, I didn't go into this movie thinking it would be the next Birdman. I'm giving this one a 6.5/10."

Both of them are sufficiently smart when it comes to comedy movies, and \u201cSisters\u201d is the test of their chemistry as they work together as siblings. Fey plays Kate, an unorganized stylist who loses her job because of her temper. On the other hand, Poelher plays Maura, a recently divorced nurse, who is always there to be a helping hand to others.Party movies like this are easy to predict: drugs, having sex, high-tuned music and fight scenes, and Sisters takes that path in a different way. The punchlines and the whole premise work together to bring a good family-comedy which delivers for quite some time. Yes, some of the jokes do not work, but when it hits, it totally hits.70% of Sisters takes place in the party which feels overlong. Also, during the second half, it loses its focus in telling the more important parts of the story.VERDICT: Indeed some of the movie's punchlines did not deliver any laughs, but when the gags do come, they work as a treat."
