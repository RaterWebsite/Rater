      "text": "Die Hard 2 is the best part in the franchise. This is a selected 90s fighter with an interestingly staged suspense. Excellent acting by Bruce Willis, who was at the peak of his career. A bright representative of the fact that not all films action movies can be boring and stupid. Great sequel."

      "text": "The second installment of a great action movie series. John McClane is back to pick his wife up from the airport in New York when he runs into some trouble with terrorists who take over the flight grid and plan to execute  their evil plans at will. McClane is forced into action when the lives of thousands of people including his wife are threatened. The smart-talking and gun blasting is alive and well in this picture. The character and story line retained in this sequel is blatantly repeated from the first but definitely welcome. That much is rare. John continues to be the normal everyday cop who accomplishes superhuman feats without really overreaching practicality, again, rare. I thought the fight scenes and shootouts were on the choppy side. That could be attributed to the older action style and the authentic nature that John McClane is meant to show. A bunch of clever bad guys up against a guy who just wont die, what more could you ask for? Well done. Action/Bruce Willis classic, it's worth a watch."

      "text": "It's a sad commentary, but every year around the holidays I start thinking about John McClain. That is how ingrained media has become in our minds. This week I decided to watch Die Hard 2 for the 8 millionth time, because unlike most sequels, I found it to be better than the first. Not to say that the first isn't a classic film, but the second one has two things the first lacked. First, Director, Renny Harlan, who is the master of action films, completely unappreciated, and a man who has given me hours of excitement. The second thing is the supporting cast, which features the likes of Dennis Franz from NYPD Blue, Fred Thompson of Law n' Order, and of course veteran character actor, William Sadler. Willis once again is brilliant as John McClain and gave the 90's a true action hero! The Die Hard films are the frame work by which all modern action films are compared and if you skipped the second one, because it was a sequel, you're an idiot! This is a can't miss movie for action junkies."

      "text": "After Die Hard hit it's predecessor for the audience and me, Die Hard 2 hit the big screen. It may not be as good as each other but it's still had the thrills and action and the music from Michael Kamen. Bruce Willis reprises his role as John McClane and all the suspense with the action still hits the film with all the dignity. After the people are saved at the Nakakomi Plaza, John has to save the people at the airport from the plane crashes caused by the terrorists including Col. Stuart played by William Sadler. There's only one plane crash which is caused by Col. Stuart and John gets upset. The people who are not from the first film know John McClane because he saved hostages at the Nakatomi Plaza. Jeez, that's a coincidence. I actually love the ending fight scene and the plane explosion. Surely I can't even get over this movie much like the first film. I would talk much about it but I can't do it anymore. It's just McClane shooting terrorists and saving the airport even though I know what causes the plane crash. It took place on Christmas Eve much like the first Die Hard and Bruce still says the line that is from the first film. Yep, you guessed it, \"Yippie-ki-yay, motherf\u00a3$ker!\" I'll bet he says that in all of the Die Hard films. While Die Hard is the most popular and memorable film of all time, Die Hard 2 had it's reputation to become a sequel and to think that Die Hard had to milk in all the sequels to impress audience and critics and myself alike. Many people say that this is the worst out of all of them, well I disagree with them, I just love and think it's a great sequel, okay, not that great but still good. But now the fifth film came out, people went mad. They said they don't like the fifth film and calling it a piece of crap. The recent Die Hard films are nothing compare to the old ones. And in the third film, it won't be the same with Holly McClane, Richard Thornberg and Al Powell from the first one to be precise. Yeah, I know he had a small role in the second film which I'm doing but that's just when he was in Los Angeles. Either ways that's Die Hard 2, a sequel to Die Hard, have my congratulations."

Because it became a series with this film.Die Hard 2 might have a different setting from the first one, but it still was astonishing. One thing that made it great was that it was directed by Renny Harlin(A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 director. Both are great films). Another reason was that it had fantastic development. Yes, some of the villains were forgettable, but Die Hard 2 is still fun and sometimes creative."

In fact, the whole premise is so utterly ridiculous that even John McClane decides to up and quit his job with the LAPD and go back to New York for the next (much better) film."

This sequel to 1988's excellent original Die Hard also with Bruce Willis this time takes place at an airport.. Die Hard 2's violence is reduced, the action scenes are less interesting and the blood is reduced. The villains aren't that good as the original and are laughable as they take over an airport and cause mayhem. The action scenes are pretty poor and Bruce Willis as John McClane doesn't seem as convincing as the first. I wish I could of starred in Die Hard 2 to steal a plane and fly off so I never had to watch this piece of junk in the first place. A terrible sequel to a brilliant original."

      "text": "This is the second film in \"Die Hard\" series, which runs around the character of Detective John McClane. In this film, he will face a terrorist group that takes control of an airport near Washington DC. Directed by Renny Harlin, the film has a screenplay by Doug Richardson and Steven E. de Souza. Bruce Willis takes the lead role.This is a sequel, and it's difficult for them to maintain the original movie's level. This was no exception, despite continuing to be a watchable film, that will appeal to the majority of the public looking for this genre of movie. It does not escape much to what are the action films of this time or change the formula used in the first film, with the exception of changing the setting for an airport in rush hour. This, ultimately, makes the film more boring than the first, because it doesn't bring anything new or different.Bruce Willis managed to remain at the level of expectations, with a very consistent and competent performance. The rest of the cast does not stand out, but also does not make blunders. The special, visual and sound effects were well done, the scenery is good and realistic. The script is the worst part of the film: with a very low quality, it has obvious plot holes and creates so fantastic situations that eventually become implausible."

It doesn't have the same tension as the original film and I didn't feel as engrossed in it as I was in the original but its a reasonably entertaining watch regardless.

This movie is so adventurous and action-packed, I love all the explosions and shootings, which is what everyone wants. I love how Barnes stuck by McClane's side throughout the film while everyone else doubted him and kicked him out of the equation. They came around eventually, but Barnes reminds me so much of Powell in the prequel. This movie agreeable lacks the raw thrills possessed by the first movie, but nonetheless it is such an enjoyable one and is of course well worth watching."
