Very predictable, very overrated & poorly written,  the only good thing is it's cinematography but that's not enough to make a good movie. I'm dumbfounded by the 10 scores, this movie is so far from perfect it's laughable and you do laugh, not with the movie but at the movie. It also explains why I had to go to the other side of town to watch it as only one theater was showing it in my state (less than a fortnight in from release date) -  that says it all really, no one's watching this garbage."

      "text": "I 've not laughed so much internally since watching \"Carry On Screaming\". I say internally because I was watching it in an arthouse cinema and an \"arthouse\" crowd is too polite and too emotionally controlled to respond honestly when viewing trash. I should have guessed by the way this film disappeared quickly from the multiplexes that the general viewing public had been warned off this film through word of mouth and I think the money men who backed it might be worried that word had got around that this self-indulgent, vanity project written and directed by Ari Aster was never going to get much affection from the viewing public.Sadly, the film carried a reputation before it that equated it with the horror classics such as \"The Shining\", \"The Wicker Man\" and the more recent \"Kill List\" - a high bar that a fast-paced,quickly-told prologue implied might be happening here.But no, weirdness and predictability of the \"look behind you\" type takes over and the standard horror beats had me mentally betting who was going to go first. Much has been made by the critics of the film being set in daylight and being full of springtime colour. For me this was a novelty that quickly wore off. This is a long film - 140 minutes - and the director has plenty of opportunities to satisfy the true horror fan. But when the level of spending on plastic flowers outweighs the amount spent on prosthetic makeup, you know you won't be jumping out of your seat too many times.I wish I'd been there when Aster pitched this movie to the money men - that would have made an interesting film in its' own right. I'm sure he used the phrases \"horror\", \"isolated pagan cult\" \"Sweden\", \"drugs\", \"sex\", \"blond Nordic types\", \"naive young Americans\", \"sunshine\", \"strange forbidden buildings\", etc... to beguile them into parting with their money. For me this is his second strike. \"Hereditary\" had a couple of decent shocks but never achieved the level of quality given to it by the critics. The same thing has happened here. I hope that by participating in it , the careers of Will Poulter, Jack Reynor and even the \"bombproof\" Florence Pugh are not going to go down the plughole - anyone remember Milly Shapiro or Alex Wolff?If you expect a horror film - don't go. If you expect a gory thriller  -  don't go.If you expect a travelogue about the way isolated communities can develop in the manner of a National Geographic film - this is the film for you !!"

I have never been so dissatisfied by a movie that I wasn\u2019t even sure what to expect from it. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s poorly acted (mostly) or that it\u2019s poorly directed; because it\u2019s not. The problem with the movie is that, for a film sold on its ability to make the viewer feel creeped out, it never feels creepy it just feels strange... and laughably so. This is by far one of the funniest movies I have ever watched, not because it was trying to be but because I, and a lot of the others in the cinema, were laughing AT the movie. There is no character development, no sensical plot and no need for half of the scenes to even be included or as long as they are. I am baffled by the critical success that this movie has become as it\u2019s just a bad movie. I could remove scenes or characters and it wouldn\u2019t make a difference to the movie. The things the movie did well it didn\u2019t do enough with and there is no resolution or repercussions for the things that happens over the course of the movie. I can imagine people that enjoyed the movie will read this and say \u201cyou just didn\u2019t understand\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s trying to be confusing and vague because that\u2019s how the main character is feeling through the movie\u201d but that doesn\u2019t make a good movie. In fact there was nothing to enjoy in this movie, nobody to route for and not enough happening over the 146 minute run time to get really engaged in the film and this is why this is the closest I have ever came to walking out of a movie over an hour in and the only time I have ever written a review of a movie as to warn people to not bother going to see this one."

While presented as a story about psychological health and well-being painted on the canvas of an allegedly suspenseful thriller, the picture comes up woefully short in the fright department (even though it tries to compensate for that with ample gratuitous gore), largely because, at a 2:20 runtime, it takes far too long to reach its final destination (which is easily visible from miles away). Florence Pugh's often-overwrought performance in this \"Wicker Man\" knock-off becomes tiresome, almost laughable, as the story wears on...and on...and on as it inches toward its wholly unfulfilling conclusion. Save your money."

Midsommar may fuel a new Oscar category, though--the \"Woulda Coulda Shoulda.\" Really, if you like grownup creepy without being bludgeoned by the filmmaker's unoriginality, go find that TWM 1973 cult classic, which also has a great soundtrack by Paul Giovanni."

It has an overwhelming sense of dread throughout but it isn't rewarding. Far too on the nose for any of the foreshadowing to feel paid off and is just in your face about it.

The American college students are universally awful characters, particularly Dani\u2019s hateful dolt of a boyfriend Christian. It is also far too long (2 h. 27 min.) This is simply undercooked torture porn that, unforgivably, puts on the pretense of being something better than torture porn. It is not scary or interesting in the slightest.

Basically it's an overbloated film where the director is in love with himself and every shot and scene. You sit through basically 2 hrs of NOTHINGNESS until things turn to horror and absurdity. Imagine going to a movie that was about a wedding and in the movie EVERY BORING DETAIL was presented i.e., the cake cutting, every dance, every speech, every boring bit of the ritual. THAT'S WHERE the 2 hr 25mins comes from!!!!   This is NOT a horror movie until the last 30mins. My advice read the synopsis and then just sneak in and watch the last 30mins of the flick.

Leaving the auditorium after the movie, someone snorted \"Nihilistic garbage,\" and I think that was a good appraisal of the film.  The movie is tedious and predictable and gratuitously gory.  It also has distinctly anti-white and anti-Christian undercurrents.  In one advertising image, two young people are walking through a lovely pastoral setting toward what appears to be a wooden cross.  What unsubtle message does that send about Christianity, in general?  What message does it send about how the creator of this slop regards Christians?  Would he have made such a movie about a village in his ancestral homeland, Israel, a movie in which the villagers are discovered to be practicing the \"Blood Libel,\" and abducting and sacrificing tourist Christian children?  Of course not.  In \"Midsommar,\" portraying some of the victim visitors as nonwhites -- visitors to a lily white Swedish hamlet -- is also some nasty messaging, on one level or another. Visually, this film is engaging and vivid and colorful.  The story is mildly interesting, but predictable.

The pagan village looks beautiful and is created with the attention to detail. The music, dances and singing are also great. The horror part is grotesque to the point of only laughable. People laughed at the absurdity of the scenes during my screening. Tonally this movie sucks. It tries to be a pointless ironic horror entertainment, psychological drama and initiate deep philosophical conversations - all in one. It achieves only the first goal - pointless entertainment. \"Midsommar\" is too ridiculous to start a more serious conversation about anything. And I think Ari Aster tried to say here something about ego/individuality culture vs collective culture. Criticise and ridicule organised religion and comfort people find in rituals and false ideas of belonging to \"the family\". Something about adult children subconsciously wanting the death of theirs parents as a form of liberation. But all those ideas fall flat because the plot of this movie is so ridiculous that it doesn't encourage that kind of discussion. It is just to weak of a movie even on the superficial level to start a conversation about deeper meanings. I also don't understand the praise that Florence Pugh receives for her performance in this movie. Yes, at the beginning she's great, but with the progression of the plot, her character becomes less and less real or interesting. All the characters in this movie act like ideas of people and not real people. I've read reviews which said that the main character's boyfriend is a jerk. Well, Dani also was very unlikable (all the characters in the movie were). She was very needy and she was as toxic in their relationship as her boyfriend. If it comes to her psychological trauma I think the director forget to show us what was her family like. That would perhaps create the ground for some kind of pay off in the finale and the ideas behind her sister's decision. \"Midsommar\" looks beautiful at times, but the plot is too weak, ridicules and laughable to provoke viewers to dive deeper. Very shallow and pointless movie. As an entertainment is a pointless B-movie. And it's not that original. It's derivative of Robert Eggers' \"The Witch\", Ari's own first movie \"Hereditary\", and many more. Only the superficial folk aspect of it is kinda new and interesting. Very pretentious artsy-farsty movie. I say \"no\" to Ari Aster and \"Yes\" to Robert Eggers. From those two Eggers is a far more focused director."

      "text": "One year after the excellent debut, Paul Asay directed his second film.  Is a year enough for an artist to create a good movie?  We know that production companies try to make more and more money by exploiting the phenomenon of the moment and this seems to me one of those cases.  Unfortunately midsommar is a failed film.  I say unfortunately because Asay has some directorial (and writing) qualities out of the ordinary, with an exceptional ability to create tension.  But if the beautiful first short part of the film makes you think you are at the consecration of an artist, the second part, that takes a completely different path from what we saw earlier, is lackluster and takes refuge in situations  seen in too many films and to become more and more a bad copy of \"The wicker man\", with an ending that makes you smile rather then letting the viewer think, or put anxiety. It would seem almost as if two different scripts had been joined.  The photography is beautiful but  points excessively to aesthetics and symmetry even when there is no need for it, ending only in a mannerism.  Too bad, because I repeat, the first half hour left us thinking about another great film"
