The detail in the animation is incredible and it feels like a labor of love from Pixar in a way the other two sequels did not. A must see for even the most casual fans. I laughed, cried, smiled, and loved basically every minute of it despite expecting a so-so sequel."

      "text": "The new chapter of the franchise also takes advantage of the chance to expand a character that, until then, was left out. While everyone is distressed or faced with deadlock, Bo Peep is the only one who has complete certainty of who she is and what her goals are. Therefore, it naturally assumes the role of guide of the group, guaranteeing great moments of action and girl power. This posture still creates a fun contrast with the Bunny and the Duckling, who could not be more lunatic. Toy Story 4 proves that, yes, there is still charisma and breath to spare for the franchise. Good. Deep down, no one was ready to say goodbye to these old friends."

      "text": "+Interesting story concept+Great voice cast+Some interesting set pieces-Felt decidedly 'below average' as a final outing for a pixar franchiseI'm unsure I know what I would want from a 4th Toy Story movie - watching this challenged my perceptions of woody and the gang in ways I didnt expect. Most of the side characters are 'back in the van' for most of this road trip movie so we are spending most of the time with the 'anxiety strickenmid life crisis woody', an 'uncharacteristically overpowered ninja skilled action ready bo peep' and new characters mentally unwell forky and sociopath gabby gabby... Perhaps i'm jaded from all the years of high quality cgi animated movies but I just wasn't as emotionally connected as I felt I was in previous outings, and so things moved along averagely which for a final toy story could be seen as disappointing? I was entertained but not enthralled as one would hope to be. Everything looks....eerily photo real at this level of quality CGI so thats a thing now! Part of me wished they had left the franchise alone and produced something new instead. Definitely worth a look for pixar fans though."

Also for money. It's definitely enjoyable and probably the funniest of the 4 movies, but they really don't use their characters that well. It bothered me that we didn't get much Buzz, potato head, Rex, etc. The entire movie felt like a long epilogue just to tell us about Woody. Still enjoyable even if I felt it was tacked on and pointless."

No. But is it ok that it does? Absolutely.The parallels to the first film are constant and intentional. Woody must deal with the new toy on the block. Woody loses said new toy and must go on a quest to retrieve it to keep his owner happy, to do the right thing because his moral compass never pointed nowhere but true. He meets scary toys that aren't scary so much as misunderstood. All is well. Except Woody.The circle of life comes full circle. This isn't 4, this is 1 all over again. But how many times can you repeat the same story, the same mistakes, the same resolutions? Woody takes a different exit this time. He loses his voice in life but gains perspective. And by doing so sets himself free, free to help all others, not just those close to him, to infinity and beyond."

      "text": "Toy Story 4 is an outstanding film that succeeds in keeping the Toy Story Franchise one of the best franchises. Here are the few negatives. The character of Forky, as great as he is, is a plot device. He really is only there to move the story forward which kinda sucks. My other issue is that the film does borrow heavily on themes and plot points from the original 3 films. Here are the positives. This film can be very emotional at times. The film starts emotional and doesn\u2019t stop being emotional until the credits roll. The last scene of the film is probably one of the most emotional Pixar moments. The voice acting is very good. Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, and Annie Potts are standouts from the main cast. Each delivers their lines with so much emotion and personality that you can\u2019t help but care about them and their struggles. The returning characters don\u2019t have a lot of screen time but they all do an outstanding job. The new characters are really good also. Keanu Reeves, Jordan Peele, and Keegan-Michael Key\u2019s characters steal the show. Each of their characters are incredibly entertaining and hilarious to watch on the big screen. This leads me to my next point. For a Pixar film, Toy Story 4 is pretty funny. There are a handful of jokes that don\u2019t land well but most of them got a chuckle out of me and one or two got full on laughs from me. The animation for this film is outstanding. It\u2019s incredible to see how far animation has come from the original Toy Story in 1995. There is one shot that showcases the passage of time and it\u2019s incredible. The story is heartwarming and nice even if it does bounce back on ideas from the previous films. The score for this film is pretty good also. It\u2019s not extraordinary but it\u2019s good. The tone for the film remains consistent all the way through and it\u2019s also paced really well. I would highly recommend seeing this in theaters. Overall, Toy Story 4 is another great addition to the Toy Story franchise with outstanding animation, great voice acting, and tons of emotion. I give Toy Story 4 a 9/10."

      "text": "\"We Belong Together\", the end title piece sung by Randy Newman as the credits rolled following the third installment made it seem that all would be fine for Woody and the gang after they landed safely in the care of Bonnie. However, Toy Story 4 goes against this happy picture we last witnessed, and instead focuses once again on the idea of getting older, growing farther away what we used to know as children, and coming to terms with this new reality. New Pixar creative Josh Cooley leads the cast and script through another timeless entry in the series, filled with colorful set-pieces (as expected) and plenty of emotional moments to make this return to the franchise feel worthwhile, and, surprisingly, necessary. These toys have changed since last seen, especially that of Woody. The amount of focus on the development and growth of Woody is great and surprising, even for a Pixar outing. His story is what drives the plot forward, and makes for a fantastic finale, one that rivals the brilliance of 3's emotional sendoff. However, as mentioned earlier - \"We Belong Together\" - the catchy, Newman helmed song, and the idea behind it, is tested in Toy Story 4. A test that makes for a must watch story, accompanied by a wonderful cast (as always), stellar visuals, and the true emotional moments that Pixar is known for."

      "text": "\"I'm not the one who is lost.\".( 81/100 ).Toy Story naci\u00f3 en 1995 y ha crecido junto a su audiencia. Cada una de sus aventuras reitera la formula, esencia y estilo de la saga m\u00e1s identificable del cine. 24 a\u00f1os y una trilog\u00eda despu\u00e9s, Woody y Buzz Lightyear regresan con una aventura m\u00e1s en la que los juguetes aprender\u00e1n nuevas y valiosas lecciones con la que podr\u00e1n cerrar ciclos y abrir caminos.Bonnie est\u00e1 nerviosa por entrar a la escuela, as\u00ed que Woody decide apoyarla. En su esfuerzo, Bonnie crea un juguete con materiales desechables que la calma y estimula espiritualmente, pero Forky, el nuevo juguete, tiene una concepci\u00f3n de si mismo que disparar\u00e1 esta nueva aventura.Toy Story 4 tiene un par de problemas para organizar sus moralejas, que son varias y muy valiosas, y pasa gracias a la formula de la saga: abrir con una propuesta \"original\", los personajes se adaptan, pero para ello se hace una burbuja de acci\u00f3n \"inteligente\" en medio del trama que enganche al publico con tensi\u00f3n y abra paso al prop\u00f3sito de la propuesta inicial. Esta t\u00e9cnica le da un ritmo mec\u00e1nico al film y, aunque no aburre, tampoco logra homogeneizar sus elementos sensibles y de acci\u00f3n. Sin embargo, los momentos sensibles est\u00e1n llenos de conciencia, auto-cr\u00edtica, valores, percepciones y argumentos que aterrizan al p\u00fablico en el terreno, me atrever\u00eda a decir, m\u00e1s humano de la saga, pues destruye la idiosincrasia de los personajes y elimina la presencia del \"enemigo\" a trav\u00e9s de un discurso hermoso sobre la consideraci\u00f3n, la utilidad y la oportunidad de aprovechar y otorgar segundas oportunidades. Toy Story 4 ya no nos trata como ni\u00f1os, y como adultos tenemos que entender que en la vida no hay enemigos, solo concepciones diferentes que merecen la misma atenci\u00f3n y respeto. Quiero remarcar una animaci\u00f3n y fotograf\u00eda con mucha textura que embellece cada locaci\u00f3n. La m\u00fasica tambi\u00e9n contribuye y, en general, las bellezas y el suspenso son de alta calidad que, aunque sean engranes diferentes, fluyen sin problemas.-Toy Story was born in 1995 and has been growing up along with its public. Each one of their adventures reaffirms the formula, essence, and style of the most recognizable saga of cinema. 24 years and a trilogy after, Woody and Buzz Lightyear comes back with one more adventure in which the toys will learn new and valuable lessons with which will be able to close cycles and open roads.Bonnie is nervous about getting into school, so Woody decides to help her. In his effort, Bonnie creates a new toy with disposable materials that calms her and stimulates her spiritually, but Forky, the new toy, has a conception about himself that will trigger this new adventure.Toy Story 4 has some trouble to organize its morals, which are several and very valuable, and that\u2019s thanks to the formula of the saga: open with an \"original\" proposal, the characters have to adapt to it and, therefore, a bubble of \"clever\" action is made in the plot to engage the public with tension and open a way to the porpoise of the initial proposal. This technique gives the film a mechanical rhythm and, if maybe it doesn't bore, neither achieve to homogenize its sensible and action elements. Nevertheless, the sensible moments are full consciousness, self-critique, values, perceptions, and arguments that hold the public to, what I would dare to say, the most humane moment of the saga. This is because it destroys the idiosyncrasy of the characters and eliminates the presence of an \"enemy\" through a beautiful speech about consideration, utility and the opportunity of taking and giving second chances. Toy Story 4 doesn't treat us as kids anymore, and as grown-ups, we must understand that there are no enemies, just different conceptions that deserve the same attention and respect. I just want to stand out the animation and photography with a lot of texture that embellishes each location. The music also contributes and, in general, the beauties and thrills are so high quality that, even though they are different gears, they flow smoothly."

Sin embargo, la personalidad de los mismos es bastante confusa, ya que cambio bastante, en especial Buzz y Bo Beep. Buzz act\u00faa como un idiota toda la pelicula y Bo Beep parece simplemente otro personaje. Aparte de la personalidad confusa y una mala edad recomendada para la pel\u00edcula, es casi una obra maestra. Ese toque de pel\u00edcula madura me encanta, como en la parte donde Woody y Forky hablan o la relaci\u00f3n entre Woody y Bo Beep (a pesar de formar parte tambi\u00e9n de lo negativo). Siento que debieron de haber puesto a Lotso o a Pete de vuelta. Podr\u00edan haberlos puesto en un buen contexto, ya que ellos ten\u00edan en parte raz\u00f3n despu\u00e9s de todo.

Not to mention that it\u2019s a Pixar sequel made in the 2010s, which don\u2019t exactly have a great reputation. Toy Story 3 was great, Cars 2 was bad, Monsters University was okay, Finding Dory was good but forgettable (no pun intended), Cars 3 was okay and Incredibles 2 was a lot of fun but not as memorable as the first movie. It didn\u2019t help that none of the Toy Story 4 trailers impressed me. I walked into this movie cautiously optimistic. I hoped it would be at least as good as Incredibles 2 but I was ready for the possibility of a disappointment. However, after seeing the movie, I can confidently say that they did it again. They made another great Toy Story movie. It has an engaging and emotional story, a lovable and memorable cast of characters, interesting themes and ideas, the most beautiful animation that Pixar has put to screen yet, pitch-perfect voice acting, and really great action and comedy! While Toy Story 3 was the perfect ending, I think Toy Story 4 is a great epilogue. This is probably where the story would go next, whether you like it or not. I do have some criticisms though. Some of the writing and comedic timing felt surprisingly clunky and off a couple of times and the ending does feel a little rushed. The ending of Toy Story 3 was definitely a better finale to the series as a whole, it was more epic and larger in scale, but this is more of a finale to the arcs of the main characters. I can\u2019t think of a more fitting way to end both this story and the 2010s decade of Pixar movies. It came in with a Toy Story movie and it went out with a Toy Story movie, and it looks like this is the last Pixar sequel we\u2019re going to see for a long time. It\u2019s been confirmed that there are no sequels coming out for the foreseeable future and they will be putting their focus on original films only. That sounds good to me! Overall, this is a must-see for any fan of the Toy Story movies. It just might be another instant classic. Highly recommended."

The storyline is both fun, emotional and even creepy? I was most surprised by ducky and bunny, the 2 new characters that were shown off through out the trailer, i thought these characters were going to be your generic pop-culture comedians, but instead they were the stand outs of the film. Their comedy and timings were hilarious at times, and outside of woody and buzz, were my favourite characters. Forky was also less annoying than id assumed going into the movie, i like his mindset of believing he is trash (maybe a reference to how all those kids who grew up with the first 3 films feel about themselves now) and the scenes of him trying to escape actually made me laugh. Most of the returning cast dont get much of a time to shine, but the new characters and the fantastic story line more than make up for it. 9/10 - the best one since Toy story 2."

The film's themes of farther-hood and letting go of the past make the film more relevant and heartfelt as intriguing you watch it. Characters such as Woody and Bo Peep have never been better and new characters like Duke Kaboom and Forky are some of the best side characters the series have ever had.

But in terms of the narrative Toy Story 4 just isn't all that interesting. Woody has an interesting character arc, but I don't buy that Bo Peep is the one to show him this arc, or that he would come to it for the reasons he does in the movie with his new owner. Forky feels like he's there mostly for comedic purposes than anything else. Which is fine, but he plays too much a big part in the story for him not to feel more impactful. Buzz Lightyear is completely wasted in this movie, the jokes with him seem like something he'd go through in a much earlier film, or heck in the first film. The veterans of the series are completely pointless, I don't see why they didn't make Bo Peep the main character and maybe leave the characters from Toy Story 3  where they were at the end of that film. It's perfectly fine movie for kids overall, but I think the older audiences who grew up with the previous films much leave wanting a bit more."

      "text": "All right, I do it in public so I might as well admit to all: most people who know me know I cry in movies and I have never been ashamed of it but to cry in an animated film??? Come on!! Okay I did and I do. I remember years ago crying when Bambi's mother died but until cartoon movies became way more, in technical ways, I didn't during Snow White, Pinocchio or even Fantasia!I saw \"Toy Story 1\" but aside from remembering some of the characters I remember little of the story. I skipped 2 & 3 but not having anything else to see today I decided to see the, supposedly, latest and last story. It is a story about how one feels not being wanted or loved anymore and how to handle the feelings and life changes.In this film we find an old friend Woody, a sheriff, has lost his first owner, Andy, who pushed him aside when Andy went off to college. Woody found consolation with Bonnie who inherited him but now she is off to kindergarten and has made her own toy, Forky, made from trash items like pipe cleaners, a plastic spoon, doll's eyes and considers himself trash but Bonnie loves him. Very shortly after bringing him home she loses him and Woody feels it is his duty to return Forky, now Bonnie's friend who in turn deserts him while at the same time convince Forky he is not just trash.The chase involves some old, and many new characters, in the Toy Story series but bogs down in the chase sequences while at the same time offering a few laughs such as a skunk sort of being a Trojan horse or at least camouflage! The main tug at the emotional strings are the reunion of Bo Peep and Woody with the former having accepted the fact that she no longer serves a purpose just moving here and there.Not having seen the middle stories I am not sure who is new here but Tom Hanks, as always, is very effective and, yes, believable as Woody. Tony Hale, new as Forky, is funny while Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear gives solid backup to his friends while Annie Potts returns as Bo Peep as a very strong woman and Christina Hendricks as sort of a villainous Gabby Gabby who wants Woody's voice box. One of the newest characters, and definitely the funniest, is Keanu Reeves as Duke Caboom, a Canadian stunt motorcyclist, full of himself and daring to do anything.\"Toy Story 4\" is a film for both children of all ages and adults will, in many cases, enjoy it more! After seeing about a dozen of the 'new' ways films are animated I am still intrigued at how the characters seem alive and, in many cases, you believe in them."

      "text": "One of the more aggravating and confounding releases of the year, based solely on the fact that it's both a genuinely good movie in its own right and one that I don't necessarily think any of us needed. I definitely won't be alone in saying how perfectly I felt the franchise's third installment seemingly concluded things for Woody, Andy, and the gang, with any mutterings of a potential fourth iteration being met with unadulterated skepticism and even derision on my part. But to be absolutely fair, this movie is terrific for the most part, with a lot of the emotionality really hitting home with me, and the animation pushing the needle even further into the realm of photorealism. This in mind, though,  could I live with the hypothetical threat of someone \"Eternal Sunshine-ing\" this movie from the annals of my memory? Yeah, I'd be okay with it, I suppose. Can I say that for any of the other three installments? Personally, no. That's an issue for me, but to be sure, I understand the overwhelming praise. I just hope \"Toy Story 4's\" success doesn't act as a precedent that studios will use to justify other future exhumations of presumably dead franchises."

      "text": "While I was initially very much against a fourth 'Toy Story' movie being made, as the third capped off everything so perfectly, (along with the fact that I find myself disappointed more often than not with Pixar sequels), I've gotta say that I'm now eating those words, as I found this to be the best sequel out of all of them (nothing's ever gonna top the first for me, but hey, that's childhood for ya!) Everything about this was so satisfying and fun.The voice acting is great from O.G. characters (Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are always perfect as Woody and Buzz respectively), as well as new additions (Keegan-Michael Keye and Jordan Peele voice a couple of stuffed Carnival prize toys, and Keanu Reeves is a riot as a Canadian stuntman toy.) The animation is so unbelievably detailed down to every last frame, image, and character, unsurprisingly making the first film from nearly 25 years ago look quite outdated by comparison. Even the story I was impressed by, as I was convinced that Pixar really had nothing else to explore with these characters, but they managed to take them in some unexpected directions, some nostalgic, and some new and surprising, even ones that tug at the emotions quite a bit, especially towards the end (as has come to be expected from the best of Pixar.) So needless to say, there's something here for all ages to enjoy. Overall, it's a sequel I still feel wasn't completely needed, but in spite of my initial skepticism, it's one I'm very glad we got nonetheless, as it gives us yet another fun time with these toys and characters so many of us have grown up watching for so long now, and they're given yet another satisfying story and ending, one that Pixar would be wise to leave be, for real this time."

      "text": "Although the Toy Story films are full of adventure and comedy, the series always includes a focus on serious, emotional moments. This one includes more drama with a continuous message about the importance of friendship and loyalty. The usual gang is back, although most of the funny supporting characters get scant attention. This one revolves around Woody, Bo and a new toy (a spork voiced by Tony Hale) as they go on an adventure to comfort their new kid/owner. The animation is gorgeous, as expected, and there are some new characters that add some fun. Overall, it's lively, well-paced and enjoyable. Not as unique or special as the first 3, but still higher entertainment value than many animated family films."

      "text": "What can I say? Toy Story 4 is a great movie, but in comparison to its last two installments, it's 'just' a solid 9. Great animation, perfect casting, great all around from the team from Pixar. Yet it's biggest disadvatage: coming of what many consider as a 'perfect trilogy'. This film is an epilogue at best to that storyline, yet after the epic that were Toy Story 2 & 3, it just can't hold a candle to those masterpieces. Is it still one of Pixar's best? Absolutely. Should Disney be inclined to make another sequel? No. As many of the character arcs have reached a satisfying conclusion, and shouldn't be commercialized even further. It's time for Woody and Co. to ride of to the sunset."

      "text": "Good movie, though the 3rd Toy Story is better IMO. It's not bad at all mind you. Duke Caboom is seriously great, the ending and the road leading there is great as well, you just have to wonder if this movie needed to be made. We had the perfect ending in 3, it feels like they're just milking the fanchise for all it's worth. Not that they have no right to do that or even that they're doing a bad job. It's pretty great, just not better than what we already had."

      "text": "Good. The 3rd one I think is better but this is not bad at all, it just doesn't reach that level. It has good emotional moments and several ones of \"knot in the throat\" in which you'll cry. I like the development of the villain (Gaby Gaby), her arc and how she evolves. The initial scene with the rain and how they tell us what happened with Bo Peep 9 years ago is GREAT. The new characters Forky, Ducky and Bunny, Duke Caboom and Giggle McDimples are great. The road that Woody has to travel and how he has to get rid of his past with Andy is very well done. The ending with Woody and Buzz Lightyear is one of the best things I've seen. 3D animation is the biggest thing that Pixar has done, there are times that even it looks real."
