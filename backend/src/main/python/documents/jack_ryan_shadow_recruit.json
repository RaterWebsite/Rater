I was hoping before the movie even began that it wouldn't have the dreaded countdown timer at the end of the movie, but of course they had to throw that in as it seems to be a requirement in all these spy movies.  The scene on the airplane where everyone is trying to figure out where the bad guy is and where he's going to strike next is really ridiculous how they figure it all out in about 3 minutes so you really have to suspend all belief when watching a film like this.

Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is possibly the best spy thriller I've ever seen. Some reasons for this are the amazing cast, led by Chris Pine, who should really get more credit for his talent. The plot was well developed and interested and the dialogue had a great combination of realism mixed with some thrown in humor that lightened an otherwise very dark and intense movie. Intense would be the word of choice, too, because this is definitely an edge-of-your-seat thriller from fairly early on. I couldn't give it top marks mainly because of the way the earlier part of the film is structured. It feels a bit cut-and-paste and doesn't develop the characters as well as it could've. The movie flies by so it easily could've been 15 minutes longer in order to better develop these things. Nonetheless, it's a great movie and worth the price of entry."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "As average as they get, seen it all a million times already. Full of over the top usual BS and mission impossible wanna be, below average directing and acting to match, just a quick hit and run movie to rake in some cash. An alright movie to watch on TV while multitasking, nothing more."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "January is my least favourite month for new movies. By this time of year, Hollywood studios are focusing much of their attention on the Sundance Film Festival, looking to acquire hidden gems, potential blockbusters and, and marvelous new indies. These films are generally purchased for next to nothing, and then marketed and released throughout the summer and fall months with the hope that they might land a huge profit. With that being said, while Hollywood runs around securing their paychecks for the upcoming year, the rest of their unwanted, formulaic, and cliched roster is leftover for audiences in January. Now let me be the first to tell you, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is no exception to this formula. Using the star-power of Chris Pine\u2019s Stark Trek franchise charm, to faded out female leads like Kiera Knightley, and ex-Marvel super director Kenneth Branagh (Thor), Ryan becomes a shady, old, and tiresome relic of the glorified days of the once cool Tom Clancy character.\r This was one film project we wish stayed in the deep dark corners of Hollywood\u2019s unproduced films, but like much of the industry\u2019s obsession with rehashing established characters and modernizing  them for current audiences, the film is a complete decomposed mush of ideas. Shadow Recruit is an overly-flashy, glossed over disaster. Failing to recruit any kind of originality in it\u2019s storytelling and script, it becomes a non-operational feature with actors who are clearly cashing in to a well established iconic Hollywood character.\r The Jack Ryan character, made famous previously by Alec Baldwin in The Hunt for Red October, Harrison Ford in Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger and Ben Affleck in The Sum of All Fears came out well before all the Ethan Hunt\u2019s and Jason Bourne\u2019s of its time. What differentiated Ryan from all the super-human covert agents, was his ability to be the closest thing to an average, everyday superhero. Mind you, in his newest entry in the film world, Ryan  seems to have his fare share of dumb luck a lot of the time\u2013all the time actually.\r The film was supposed to be released on Christmas Day 2013, instead, due to an overcrowded array of blockbusters and late-entry Oscar caliber films, Shadow Recruit opted for an early 2014 slot where it seems to fit in much better.\r Pine plays Jack Ryan, who we first see attending the London School of Economics in England. After a fateful September day in New York City (I\u2019m sure you can guess which day I\u2019m referring to, especially since all terrorist inspired spy-plots these days revolve around, if not hint at this historic day), Ryan pursues a career as a United States Marine. Wounded in action, Ryan oddly gains the attention of CIA agent Thomas Harper (Kevin Costner). Ryan\u2019s intellectual expertise and Marine instincts, along with Harper\u2019s experience in the agency, the two team up to bring down an elaborate economic scheme that will leave the United States in a Second Great Depression. Plunged into the world of Wall Street as an analyst, Ryan unnoticeably navigates the corrupt underworld of financial markets, which inevitably leads him on a place to Russia and face-to-face with Victor Cherevin (Kenneth Branagh). Between navigating the Russian crime world, a life of espionage and the annoying and overbearing requests of his girlfriend Kathy Muller (Knightley), Jack is tested physically and mentally as he is left with the fate of the US economy resting on his shoulders.\r Throughout the course of his mission, time and again Ryan begin to lose faith in his ability to come through a hero, and frankly so do we. The blame can\u2019t all be put on Pine, who really does his best with material that seems D.O.A once it hits the screen. Unfortunately, Ryan doesn\u2019t actually accept his mission and take on the bad guys until his female love interest is put in the mix and inevitably endangered, which let\u2019s be honest, makes for a cowardly and unmotivated super-spy.\r The film tries its best to round out a cast that is engaging, meticulous and somewhat ironic to the overall Jack Ryan canon. Costner, who mentors Pine as the current Ryan, was first offered the role of Ryan back the late 80\u2032s, but declined to star in Dances With Wolves, which earned him two Oscars. Knightley, who seems to be floating under the radar rather than on the it these days, clearly took the role to get her face back in the mainstream spotlight, especially since her descent into independent feature film fame has not planned out as well as she would have liked since her blockbuster days in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. Branagh, who couldn\u2019t resist adding another cultural character reference to his filmography, offers a typical Russian villain with a laughable accent and unintentionally uproarious one-liners. Either way you look at it, from the lazy one-sheet with the exhausted catch-phrase \u201cTrust No One\u201d, to the overused black/orange colour scheme on the theatrical poster, Shadow Recruit doesn\u2019t seem to have much faith."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "This film can be summarized in one word: average. It such a shame to say so as well, it was promoted as an action film that could be entertaining whilst maintaining some level of intelligence. Unfortunately, it focuses so much on being intelligent that it becomes quite dull, lacking any real action or emotion. By the time the film reaches its climax, you aren't that intrigued, and you really just don't care about it, which is disappointing, because with its story, it should have been a lot more tense. See it if you're a die hard fan of the other Jack Ryan films, other than that, i can't really recommend this to anyone."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "This film is a definite no go. I was expecting an action packed thriller with Chris Pine playing a 'Jason Bourne'-esqe role. Instead all I found out is that Keira Knightly CANNOT do acting which doesn't involve dark drama. Keira plays the role of Jacks girlfriend, she was dreadful. The whole story and plot was far too unrealistic, bordering on the Need for Speed franchise. Save some time and don't see this."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Major disappointment. It lacked enough credibility to suspend belief, like the prior classic Jack Ryan films.\r The writing and plotting was lazy, insulting, and downright ridiculous, even for a middle-of-January summer popcorn movie. Lazy, because there was no interest in researching and integrating any details that add credence to the characters or plot. Insulting, because it didn't trust its audience to possess any intelligence or sophistication. And ridiculous, for the plot machinations that allowed Jack Ryan to do the things he did.\r I like Chris Pines, and he was allowed to show a bit of his natural charisma, but it wasn't nearly enough to save this film."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Well made, excitingly paced action, spy pic.  All of the lead actors were exactly what was needed:  Chris Pine, soft on the eyes, action hero, an average Joe in for more than he bargained for, but a soldier first and foremost;  Keira Knightley, the pretty innocent who tags along, and then is up to the tasks at hand; Kevin Costner, the old mentor and Kenneth Branagh, who gets special mention for playing a Russian flawlessly.  The plot was not complicated, easy to understand, but exciting even with its simplicity.  And the plot was thoughtful in our contemporary times:  full of technology and ideas of economic terrorism.  The films was pleasant in its setting:  lavish apartments and office buildings, high tech screens, exteriors in Moscow."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Well acted, The plot keeps you some-what interested even though it's a bit generic, and the action, while a bit on the lite side through out, is enjoyable as well.

Kenneth Brannagh delivers a very solid spy movie. Chris Pine fits the part, doesn't overact and is very well supported by Kevin Costner, Kenneth Brannagh and Keira Knightly. Beautiful cinematography. I loved the shot of the reflection of the TV screen on the wall showing the burning Twin Towers. What a great way to set the tone for a game of shadows. Also, the sequence in the movie theater almost makes the movie feel old school, which contrasts well with all the slick technology. Very entertaining."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "Reflections after the screening of Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit\rI sincerely hope that Woody Allen will not make (and participate as main character in) action/spy movie. I sincerely hope that Sylvester Stallone will not play Hamlet in Broadway. If \"Thor\" can support the fragrance \"King Lear\" by Branagh, \"The adventures of Agent Zero Zero Shakespeare\" are ridiculous with the same perfume. The movie is great if you go for a very first time in a cinema and you never watched action movies. Is insulting for the genre. Sorry, but looks like a good student who made his home-works, but never learn the essential. I saw a B-movie with a actors. The reason can be the big ego of the director, the poor story...or me. I think that this movie is to the action/spy genre what is the Tyler Perry's Madea to the comedy genre. Sorry to start this year with such a flop."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "The Bourne series reboots back to the creation of the secret agent, as a brainy analyst recruited by the CIA. When he happens upon a scheme to collapse our economy, he's sent to Moscow to stop it. Needless to say, chases and violent encounters ensue. Chris Pine has moved into the lead and he's an assured, solid action hero. Even though the plot has no surprises, director Kenneth Branagh (who also plays the bad guy) has crafted a taut little mission. Unfortunately, the blurry camerawork obscures much of the action. The attractive Russian locations (inside and out) are a bonus and the movie's momentum makes it entertaining. NOTE: Ballet legend Mikhail Baryshnikov has a cameo."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Maybe it won't blow you away like the Bourne and Bond series has, but Jack Ryan proves to be worth a watch. With a smartly written plot, well shot action, and excellent cast, there's a lot to enjoy here. The plot might not always be the most original thing in the world, but is still enjoyable. I have to say as someone who hasn't liked Chris Pine in the past, I really enjoyed him here. He's not playing some pretty boy d-bag like I would expect him to, but rather a likable and not arrogant character. Costner and Knightley are also fantastic, with Knightley in particular proving noteworthy. Her character isn't just another pretty face. With such an excellent batch of characters I found it hard to not enjoy the movie. It may not be as noteworthy or original as some other similar movies in the genre, but it's still worth a look. My total score is a 7.5/10=Good."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Very good action-filled movie from start to finish. After the mixture of actors that have portrayed Jack Ryan and particularly mediocre showings from Ben Affleck and Alec Baldwin, this young Chris Pine is a breath of fresh air.

We can say it is something like that, but not a heist  movie, though the law enforcement theme. As usual, it is the good guys (Americans) versus the bad (Russians, sometimes Germans). After the successful movie 'Thor' I did not expected a movie like this from the director. It is like falling back to the average, I thought he's better than this. This movie was a nice entertainer though had few problems in some areas.\r The movie kick starts with the real incidental disaster attached to the opening scene. And then moves into a few years later where the regular story begins. The movie focused only three main characters plus a villain and fails to recognize others around them. Jack Ryan is an Afghan war veteran who is recruited by the secret force official Tom Harper. He believes it is an easy job and honoured to serve his country. After sometime the role of his duty completely changes. Now he has to fight back from a Russian power hand in order to save himself. While advancing everything it goes faster and drag in the people around him he love. Can he successfully pull off the mission is what the grand ending reveals.\r The cast was not bad at all as well their performances. The equal amount of action, drama and thriller kept the movie get going at a constant pace. But I was really bored for half of the movie. I did not find any freshly innovated scenes with this altered story of many other movies. While a watch you would remember 'Mission Impossible', and 'Bourne' series and of course including one of the titles from the first paragraph I mentioned. An average summer entertainment movie. I better must forget this and expect the director's next project 'Cinderella' instead.\r 6.5/10"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Cliched and largely unoriginal story but highly engaging and very gripping during the denouement.

If you are looking for an intelligent well acted spy thriller then not so much.  Writers Adam Cozad and David Koepp have taken Tom Clancy\u2019s reluctant CIA analyst who keeps being drawn into the action whether he wants to go or not and cast him as a CIA analyst working undercover on Wall Street who reluctantly gets drawn into the action in Moscow.  This time Jack Ryan, who has been portrayed by almost as many actors as Batman or James Bond is woodenly played by Chris Pine.  Pine\u2019s main claim to fame is his ability to flawlessly recreate William Shatner\u2019s James T Kirk in the unnecessary reboots of the Star Trek franchise.  Along for this preposterous ride is Keira Knightley as Ryan\u2019s not-quite-wife.  Within 24 hours she is able to get time off work at a major New York hospital, get a visa to visit Russia and fly to Moscow to surprise our hero in his hotel room.  When he finally admits to her that he is a CIA agent she is happily relieved because she thought he was having an affair.  After totally accepting Jack\u2019s double life she becomes an important partner in his spycraft, and to top it off is fully conversant in Russian literary fiction.\r One of the movie posters has the tag line \u201cTrust no one\u201d but there is no double crossing or \u201cthings are not as they seem\u201d anywhere in this movie.  Kevin Costner manages to be stiffer than Pine in his portrayal of the senior operative who is Jack\u2019s handler in Moscow.  Director Kevin Branagh is suitably evil as the Russian financier bent on destroying the US economy with the full blessing of the Russian minister of something-or-other.  Even our suicide bomber plays according to clich\u00e9.  No plot twist anywhere.\r The action sequences though make up for the weak storyline and weaker acting.

I don't care that the 'Russian' villain was cartoonish. We all love those. What was bad was the lack of action! Yes it's a thriller but it's an action thriller, correct me if I'm wrong. Explosions? One lousy under water one. The Sum of All Fears didn't prevent the nuclear strike it let it happen and then explored the aftermath! Deaths? Only a few and not memorable. Tension? Hardly. We all know the hero will get the goods and save the day, the success in these films is in making the viewer feel that is in doubt. To do that the film needs to have a few surprises up it sleeve - typically using a supporting cast more. You can't do much with only four characters, you can't kill people off or have people be exposed as not who they are. In fact you can hardly do anything at all with four characters (Pine, Costner, Knightley and Branagh).\r So, so dull. A decent starting point of a plot lost by lack of action, lack of thriller development, lack of tensions, no surprises and bizarrely a bare bones cast.

Chris Pine, Kiera Knightley, Kenneth Brannagh and Kevin Costner all offer up excellent characterisations and it's good to see Knightley out of costume (period costume, that is) for a change. Brannagh, complete with foreign accent, offers up a villain to compete with the best and his directorial style keeps everything fast and furious.

I have no complaints with the acting, because the actors did the best they could with what they were given.
