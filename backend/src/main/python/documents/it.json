The script is very well written, the atmosphere is both bright and dreary, the scares are inventive and acting is great: these kids really have strong futures ahead. Bill was fantastic as Pennywise, although not as memorable as Curry, it's definitely a better, more frightening performance. The use of CGI in the film is done well... so well that i had trouble knowing what was practical and what wasn't. The girl who played Beverly was the standout performance, putting on the strongest front when with the boys while having to hide the darkest pain. Finn Wolfhard cracked me up as Richie, Jack Grazer did a great job playing the fast talking mummy's boy, Jeremy Ray Taylor as Ben (the new kid who's bullied for his weigh) had me sympathising with him the most. Lastly, shout out to the actors who played the bullies, they were almost a frightening as Pennywise. I f*cking hated Henry. I also f*cking hated Beverly's creepy pedo Father.

It's another in a long line of recent \"franchise-y\" films that are more about their existence than about anything resembling a coherent story or theme. This film, taken on its own terms, is about a boogeyman who's mostly a clown and a group of kids who find his house to bludgeon him to death. That's it, and even that's pushing it.Yes, Pennywise says that famous catchphrase about floating, and even better the movie interprets it literally, as if the quote exists outside a reality tied to story, character, or theme - in this film, kids actually float down in his sewer. Ohhh creepy, that's what it means.The whole thing is just a serious of intermingled \"scare\" scenes, one for each kid, wherein they are given the barest bones of character to make it work. Bill stutters, but only like once or twice and it never matters at all. Richie is a smartass, but he dresses cool and hip and is woke so modern audiences love him - his character doesn't grate at all making you wonder why he's such a \"loser\". Ben is fat, but in a fun superficial way and he's clearly not bothered by it. Mike's character might as well not exist at all (his entire raison d'etre is to have access to cattle guns). Eddie has his inhaler and uses it all of like once - he's more of a pill junkie. He seems rather charming and smart, and his mother is a bloated caricature that does nothing for his character either. Stan is a cipher.At least Beverly has a some development, but it's driven home in such a broadly obvious over-the-top way that again, it feels like a comment on people's prior conception of her character and not as a real character herself in this story. Her dad is a one-dimensional sexual predator, and her ability to overcome him and in turn Pennywise, rewards her with a damsel in distress storyline that ends in a literal kiss from Prince Charming to wake her - there doesn't seem to be any irony here either.The sequel to this almost can't exist based on how inept the storytelling in this one is - it will pretty much have to be it's own standalone film. I don't like to judge a film based on its source material, it should stand on its own, but this film fails miserably in both regards so it's a bit of moot point.The acting is uniformly good however. The kids are well cast, and do their parts well. Bill Skarsgard has potential, though it's wasted by lackluster use of him. There's some kind of shaky-cam run at the camera trick that's bafflingly inept and seems like a cop out by a story that has run out of tricks and doesn't trust an actor to do his job creating tension.A good example of this is the opening scene - little Georgie has this creepy encounter with Pennywise, and he's charming and owning the screen, when inexplicably the camera cuts to some old woman coming out of her house with a cat, then it cuts back to Pennywise and all the tension has started to dissipate. Then the movie has the \"cajones\" to literally show Georgie's arm getting torn off and Pennywise's mouth full of sharp teeth. Cut to the cat staring down at the street. That old trick - Alien first did it in 79. It's all so explicit way too early in the film and it kills all of the atmosphere and dread that could have permeated this.Why. was. there. so. little.

And boy did it bring me back. The child actors put in outstanding performances in a movie where the adults are thankfully absent. This movie is more than just a one trick pony. We have, coming of age,  child abuse , a tender romance and a horror rolled into one with a large dollop of sardonic teen humour. Worked well . Usual jump-out of your skin tactics which to some of the jaded are cliched but to me were awesome and a liberal use of vulgar language which was strangely appropriate and satisfying. The clown is terrifying and nightmarish\u2026... And there is a chapter 2 to come..Disturbing as well is scary people with obvious psychological issues downvoting everything in sight. Perfectly good innocuous reviews? Stop enabling the mentally unwell Metacritic. It\u2019s very uncool.."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Just loud and obnoxious \"scary\" scenes without any tension. The kid scenes are decent, but the whole movie is just a bit tiring.There was a good movie in there, but the execution is quite bad.Pennywise looks cool. Mwehh.."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "It has seen an unprecedented amount of attention. You would think that something seen in all the marketing and ads makes the movie something different, that it does something revolutionary, that it improves upon previous horror movies while paving the way for more terrifying adventures led by loveable kid characters. Well you would be right, to some degree.The story features a collection of teenagers living in the small American town of Derry. At the beginning of the movie we are shown the younger brother of their leader, Bill being brutally murdered by Pennywise the clown  who dwells in the sewers. This sets off a chain of frightening and creative scenes where each member of the losers club is faced with Pennywise taking the form of their greatest fear. They then make the collective decision to pursue the clown and kill it once and for all.The story says relatively uncomplicated which means there aren't too many times where you find yourself confused. There are also plenty of scenes where the characters are able to bond with one another and grown their relationship. Each actor gives an outstanding performance and work the personality of their respected character flawlessly. There is no sugar coating with the characters who all have social, domestic and school related problems. This makes them easier to connect with given that they all have problems they cant outrun much like ourselves. Bill Skarsgard also gives Pennywise a quirky yet demonic personality which differs only slightly from the performance given by Tim Curry. They both relish in terrorising these children but Skarsgard proves noticeably more sinister and serious. I am not saying having a more serious Pennywise is a bad thing but it only makes him more similar to hundreds of other serious faced, emotionless bad guys from other horror movies. But Pennywise wouldn't be anything without his fearsome talent.It has scares by the dozen and each one is as creative and spine-chilling as the last, each one manages to connect with something deeply feared by their corresponding character wether it be Bill seeing Georgie decay before him or the Leper chasing Ed, a child with OCD. Rarely is any blood shown which only highlights the situation and effects when it does make an appearance. But for every scare the kids are faced with there is a real life problem to go along with it, this makes the idea of conquering pennywise represent tackling our own fears and problems in real life, and the best way to do it is as a team. It is not a flawless movie. The story has many moments and details that feel quite useless and add nothing to the story, this wouldn't be so bad if they added to the humour or added more depth to the characters but they don't which only drags the movie on for longer. As I have said before I am quite fond of the scares in the movie but they are also guilty of jump-scares, a notoriously cheap way to scare the audience. About seventy percent of times you will hear a scream from the audience because of a jump, a mistake the movie also makes is how surprisingly well the kids seem to deal with life with Pennywise. Every time a terrifying scene concludes we see the characters doing something completely normal where they appear unaffected. This manages to lessen the impact of any scares and makes Pennywise seem like a nuisance than a threat.So in conclusion, It is a fresh and uniquely scary take on the Stephen king novel and one that is well worth your money and your appreciation."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "\u042d\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0443\u0436\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f, \u0432 \u043d\u0435\u043c \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f, \u0437\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0435\u0439 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0431\u043b\u044e\u0434\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0438 \u043f\u0443\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0438 \u0432\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0442, \u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0436\u0438 \u0441\u043b\u0438\u0448\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \"\u0440\u043e\u0444\u043b\u044f\u0442\" \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433 \u043d\u0430\u0434 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u043c. \u0415\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0431\u044b \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0443\u0436\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u0438 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0435, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0442 \u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c, \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0431\u044b\u0442\u044c \u044f \u0431\u044b \u0438 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b \u044d\u0442\u0438 \"\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043f\u043b \u0410\" \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442\u044b."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "This movie has a good plot, but it is executed horribly.

It doesn't use needless jump scares to get its scares across to the audience. Instead it uses it's dark atmosphere and general creepiness to deliver it's scares. Pennywise was played brilliantly and I'm sure it gave many people nightmares. The comedy in this movie was really funny but it was a little overused in my opinion. Great chemistry between all the kids make this movie a very enjoyable watch."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Although there was a lot to like about It from the minute-to-minute, the overall experience was let down by trying to do too much with the two and a half hours the film ran for. As a story, It has three main threads: the first (and most advertised) is the horror aspect; following that is mystery, and then coming of age. Whilst each of these areas are visited in the film, none of them are really given enough time to breathe and can come across as either rushed or half-baked, leading to an incomplete experience. The main draw for audiences for the film would be the horror and mystery aspects, but much of the screen time is dedicated to the coming of age story, which often feels disjointed to the rest of the film. These moments feel a little too light and comedic given the subject matter. I occasionally felt as though each part was written separately and put together at the end, as characters would suffer from extremely traumatic experiences and then not bring them up when they were with their friends the next day. I thought that this may be down to It messing with their memory, but it is never made clear and can feel a little weird. Possibly the strangest example of this is a light hearted cleaning montage of a bathroom which-- the scene before-- had been the stage of one of the most distressing moments in the story.The horror aspects of the film all felt a little rushed and lacking in tension. Each follows a strict formula: the manifestation of a character's fear appears, there's a close up of said scary thing, then it runs at the character who promptly escapes. The first few times this happened put me on edge a little bit, but by the fourth time, they came across as a weak attempt at dark humour rather than being legitimately scary. No time is really given for tension to build up for the horror, which is absolutely crucial in the same way a good joke needs time to build up to a punchline. I wasn't too sure what to expect coming into the film, but it was sold to me as a friend as being the story of a community slowly being controlled and overwhelmed by a force of pure evil. There was no build up in atmosphere or darkening of the world to show this. The horror moments just happened, ended, and the plot rumbled on. A good contrast to this would be Paranormal Activity, The Shining or Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond is Unbreakable, in which the malevolent forces' build up in power is felt everywhere and becomes almost oppressive, building up to a brutal crescendo at the end. There was none of this here: the final raid on It's lair felt like some bored kids trying to pass the time rather than a necessary act to end evil's hold on a small town. The mystery of It's nature is alluded to but never really looked at. One of the kid's does some investigation and unsettling pictures from the past are shown, which worked very well and pulled me in, but this was quickly shelved and didn't really go anywhere. Overall, I feel that two things could have been done to improve the film: the first would be to tell more stories through subtext and the second would be to make it a miniseries in order to free up more hours to dedicate to plot threads. Some better editing and use of subtexts would really free up time that could have been spent exploring the nature of It and to allow horror elements to breathe. Around an hour is spent establishing that each character is a social outcast and that they are being bullied; this could have been shortened to a few minutes with a montage of them being bullied or even just establishing them as a group that already know each other and have them being chased by the bullies in their car. The whole plot with the bullies doesn't really go anywhere either. We see one being possessed but that ends without really building tension or threatening the group past a small power struggle. This may sound overly negative, but it's mainly borne of disappointment rather that disdain. The sense of setting and world-building were top notch, and some of the characterisation worked really well. I don't thing the film has sold me to watch the second chapter when it releases next year, but I have already picked up the novel it was adapted from and I am eager to start reading it."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "A great surprise for me!

A small critic is the montage/transition of the movie when it comes to the encounter with the clown for every kid.

With their own quirks, plenty of time to see them interact, and fantastic acting by all, I loved every second of them on screen together.  Of course the movie goes into some cliched horror movie things (which I won't mention) but overall I was shocked at how well this film blended drama, really funny comedy, and downright scary moments.  Two scenes in particular freaked me out and neither were particularly big scare moments.  Also, neither actually features a clown, something I'm not really sure I get why people are actually afraid of.  The first happens in the background, during a library scene.  The second is a painting...that's all I'll say about those.Also, every character stands out and was memorable.  I'd absolutely hang out with any of them if they were real people and definitely related to a few.  Besides the guys in the group there was a breakout performance by the female character. Pennywise was also brilliantly portrayed here.  Creepy, relentless, and of course, scary.  While no actual clown moments were all that nightmare inducing, there's no one that can honestly say they didn't get effected by the dread and force in which he hunted each character.  During a house scene every character gets separated and goes through some pretty torturous moments, all while we get to see them act exactly like we would.  Which brings me back to the acting/writing.  There's no \"too smart for their age\" kid here...no kid acting like a grown up.  All these kids are scared and freaking out on their own and band together at the end when they realize they're all part of a stronger unit.

Since I do recommend seeing it, and there are plenty of good aspects of the movie, I'm going to focus on the few things that I thought really missed the mark.The movie is obviously supposed to be horror at heart, but the horror elements were often undermined by misplaced comedy.  During the more intense moments, where life is literally on the line, no kid in real life is going to be joking around about something stupid in that moment, but in \"It,\" it happens pretty routinely.  It really undercuts the believability and breaks immersion when this happens, and makes you wonder what the director was trying to achieve.The other gripe I have it with the storytelling.  Before major events, usually you have some lead-up or foreshadowing so that when a character does something significant, you know why they are doing it.  In \"It,\" the characters were often doing some pretty major actions with seemingly little reason to do so.  There are also a few parts in the movie that only make sense if you have read the book or have seen the original 1990 movie, making it so that this movie doesn't entirely stand on its own.Misplaced comedy and shortcutted storytelling aside, this was a pretty entertaining movie.

It's big-thrills, large and flashy, and almost rapid fire. While there's a great little atmosphere to things, it doesn't change the fact that IT simply isn't very frightening. Instead it's more exciting and outright fun to watch Pennywise torment the kids. As a result I was able to deal with the fact that I wasn't exactly quaking in my boots. There's also the fact that the movie has such a great, memorable villain. One portrayed excellently by Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd. If they nail the sequel I have no doubt Pennywise will finally be held to same level of respect as Freddy Kruger, Michael Myers, Leatherface, and Jason Vorhees by becoming one of the iconic horror villain icons in the mind of just about every horror fan, and not just he clued in. Heck, this movie might even be enough to do that on it's own.The real strength of the movie is in it's characters and story. Both of which are brimming with heart and humor. More so than we usually see from this genre. It's about friendship, facing your fears, and is funnier than most comedies. It's a blood-soaked coming of age tale that's done rather believably (given the premise) in just about every area. There is even a nice amount of fidelity to the source material and the new stuff fits right in.There is a little something missing from the movie however. Some of the book's core themes didn't make the cut. We never really get to see the effects IT has on the town as a whole. How everybody seems to ignore what's going on, such as the adults turning blind eyes to acts of cruelty that regularly occur between the kids. I also found a little bit of a problem with the movie's depiction of Henry Bowers.We don't get to see his transformation from regular bully to legitimately dangerous psychopath. He's just homicidal from the get go and there's no context as to why he is so aggressive towards Ben Hanscom in the way that he is. Another complaint is that the movie doesn't do much with Mike Hanlon. He's the only member of the Loser's Club who feels left out for the majority of the film.While not without it's flaws, IT is still very much a triumph. With a stellar cast of genuinely teenage actors (the standouts being Wolfhard and Lillis), strong writing, entertainingly brutal thrills and a great sense of humor, IT is an all around great time at the movies. IT also stands as a satisfying adaptation of a Stephen King work. The most satisfying in quite a long time. IT easily stands amongst the top of the pack in terms of that. As a huge fan of the book I was quite entertained. I had a blast and highly recommend giving it a shot. Even if you haven't read the book, it's still just a really good horror movie in it's own rights."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "One of the few authentic scary movies that stays true to King's novels. Definitely has the Stranger Things vibe. It's scary but not scary, scary. Kids will definitely be scared. But like most typical horror movies, it keeps you scratching your head for their idiotic actions. Characters will often wander off on their own when they shouldn't. But I guess this makes for a good scary movie?"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I found myself really engage throughout the run time of this film. It was really easy for me to get swept away and just have a lot of fun. Let's take a look at some of the best parts:1.Acting- I was genuinely surprised at just how good the performances in this movie were. Espcially from Skarsg\u00e5rd, Wolfhard, Grazer and Lieberher. It was really easy to buy into every one as characters and to start to see them for who they were portraying. Lieberher played Bill Denbrough, a young teenage boy who has a stutter, when watching this movie it is immediately one of the first things you will notice but as time goes on it began to feel natural and it wasn't noticed anymore. That is due to excellent acting both by Lieberher and those around him. Skarsgard did an amazing job as well, he was intense and creepy. His voice was haunting and his mannerisms sent chills down my spine. In my eyes, he out performed Tim Curry in creating a truly intimidating and terrifying presence.2.Comedic Relief- So this movie has quite a bit of comedic relief, and a large part of it was from the interactions with the kids. Finn Wolfhard really delivered a solid performance, and was a huge standout in the comedic area. Any time a movie has a comedic relief aspect to it, it has the potential to go horribly wrong. It handled itself really well it was smart and strategic about the timing of it's comedy. Muschietti did a really impressive job with making a huge part of the comedy physical as well. There were scenes when the kid's were in scary situations and one of them would use their inhaler during a suspenseful moment. It all worked and felt seamless to the movie, while really developing the nature of the characters and provided a strong underdog feel.3.Tone- I was really impressed with how Muschietti created a pretty unique tone for the movie. He did a good job with his color grading and his editing to help create this almost realistic feel. His shots felt natural and grounded, so when stuff was going crazy on screen, I felt like I was there. He used a lot of simple camera tricks to pull off big moments. A lot of the time in modern film, things don't feel natural. Most lighting in movies can almost give off a glossy feeling and give off the \"I'm watching a movie\" vibe. It didn't feel that way. It was small and it felt like I was apart of the kids group experiencing all of this with them.4.CGI use- CGI in any film can either help it quite a bit or it can distract in a lot of ways. The CGI with Pennywise the clown felt real. It didn't look cheap or feel that way at all. It just felt like it was all happening. This is because of the amazing practical effects in the movie. Muschietti and Skarsg\u00e5rd worked hard to make Pennywise scary on his own, and then brought it the CGI to really sell the full thing. Now this movie was not perfect. Let's look at what could've been better: 1.Scariness- Now, this might be an unrealistic expectation I had from watching the original It back in my childhood. I just was not scared throughout the run time of It. I never felt the same sense of urgency I do in other horror films. Don't get me wrong, the scares in this movie worked. It was fun to get startled they took their time setting up some really good moments. There was just no sense of tension from scene to scene. It all felt deflated after the big moments. This is also due to the marketing of the movie. I think the marketing made it out to be this terrifying horror movie. Before the screening of Annabelle Creation, they showed a clip of It. This was prefaced with Stephen King talking about how scary this movie was and to only watch \"If you dare.\" This made me feel like It was going to knock me out of my seat, when in reality it was only kind of creepy.2.Underused Characters- One of the biggest issues I had with It was the feeling that some of the characters weren't used to their full potential. The 1st act of the movie did a beautiful job introducing us to each character, and allowing us to kind of get to know them through their fears and who they are. Toward the 3rd act it felt like some of the characters were tossed to the back. Namely Stan (Wyatt Oleff,), Mike (Chosen Jacobs) and Ben (Jeremy Ray Taylor). While the characters of Bill (Jaeden Lieberger) Richie (Finn Wolfhard) and Eddie (Jack Dylan Grazer) really were prominent. We didn't see as much with Stan, Ben or Mike. The whole premise of the 3rd act was to be together and to stand together against Pennywise. But the team aspect didn't feel inclusive of the others. Overall, I had a great time with It. I thought it was one of the best remakes and adaptations I have seen. It had terrific performances, really entertaining comedic moments with some beautiful looking shots and CGI. It did fall a little toward the 3rd act with the failure to include all of the characters they introduced throughout the first act. It was a perfectly fine scary movie. I am going to give It a B+."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Over-rated and underwhelmed. The movie is an adequate one. It has some very funny lines by the kids which was a surprise, visually it's good to watch, the clown is good and so on. It's not a horror or scary movie though, it feels like \"the goonies\" or maybe \"strange things\" (but not as good). It lacks legitimate scares, instead has lots of screaming kids instead of suspense. The director should have watched an episode of 2 of the X-Files and perhaps he could have created some actual suspense. Overall, it wasn't a bad movie, it had moments... but not enough for a 2 hr 15min movie.  Should you see it... eh, why not. Are you missing anything is you don't... definitely not."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "IT is arguably one of the best horror movie adaptations I have ever seen in a while. Unlike the miniseries adaptation of IT starring the infamous Tim Curry, it goes way deeper than you think. For this movie adaptation of Stephen King's notoriously terrifying novel, it still has an element that seems friendly, but it will definitely scare the crap out of you of how crazy this movie is. The writing by True Detective's Cary Joji Fukunaga truly impresses me, the direction set by Andy Muschietti is very well executed, and the performances by the young cast truly shines in this movie. Let's also not forget about Bill Skarsgard's portrayal as Pennywise The Clown. That man right here can easily scare the crap out of you! This movie pays the homage to the novel and the miniseries together, and without a doubt, this movie is worth checking out if you're a Stephen King fan or a horror movie fan!"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This movie has everything. Comedy, Camaraderie, Jump scares and thrills. Highly recommended and I am numb to most horror movies these days so I was pleasantly surprised. Even my lady liked it and she hates horror movies!

Best horror movie in years."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Incredible film. A horror movie that finally lives up to the hype. I was a little skeptical from the trailers but after watching the Georgie clip I was in. The acting was incredible especially Pennywise and he clearly drew inspiration from Ledger's joker. The kids also did great. Every kid actor has there moments and all had awesome interesting things about them that made them relevant in the film. The movie is absolutely hilarious too. Go and see the movie you will not be disappointed. I also dug the time period during 1989. Great time to put a horror movie."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "The movie It 2017 remake was an awesome film! Yesterday we headed out to see \u201cIt\u201d and everyone in the theater was clapping, the cast was great and the effects were far more superior than the original which made the film better than the original. I\u2019ve seen many say they were scared as I wondered why were they scared with the original?Clowns have never freaked me out, the original sort of put a nice dark spin on clowns which I saw to be awesome. It the original was brilliant and in now way is this movie a better film; it\u2019s just a perfectly put together remake respecting both films as equal. They did a wonderful job on the remake and I look forward to putting it in our personal film collection. \u201cIt 2017\u201d is the 4th good movie to come to the theater in 2017 so far."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Huge props to the casting director for the choice of those kids - especially the girl who is a revelation. The film isn't nearly as scary as the critics made it out to be, but it's definitely fun.  Now I understand why everyone told me that Stranger Things was heavily influenced by IT - both this movie and that series have a similar feel (and, of course, they share an actor - which was a slightly odd choice.)."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "'IT' was a true experience. Personally, I'm a fan of the book, for it never failed to creep the **** out of me. Same goes for this adaptation. It's filled with scares (not the cheap kind, though) (the dude beside me at the theaters literally jumped off his seat during one scene), and at the same time has a huge side of humor and coming-of-age. The direction is very well thought out, and the performances of the kids are just so good (Eddie is my personal favourite). The best part about it that it was very very very faithful to the source material (even Stephen King, who hates the classical adaptation of 'The Shining', expressed his admiration for this one). I loved it. I was really beautifully-made, and most importantly, very worth the hype."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "\"Mama\" director Andy Muschietti's adaptation of the classic Stephen King novel and effective update of the 1990 miniseries starring Tim Curry, \"It\" improves upon its predecessors in almost every way. And by \"predecessors,\" I don't just mean the aforementioned TV special.  Indeed, while this film is more frightening, captivating, engaging, and simply well-produced than the 90's cult classic, it also helps streamline, normalize, and enhance the source material itself, in all its idiosyncratic glory. This is an incredibly well-realized piece of horror filmmaking with terrific world-building and magnificent performances all over (particularly from those of the film's \"Losers Club\"). And while I find it may deviate a bit too much from its own remarkably well-established tone here and there, I'd still say it's nothing less than an achievement overall."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "See ITFear ITLove ITThis is a great horror movie and a faithful adaptation of one of Stephen king's greatest work. In fact it manages to be scarier and funnier than the original while also being a great adaptation.

What I like most is the trailers and scenes found online did not spoil the movie. The actual movie goes way more into these scenes and makes them longer. What happens to Georgie at the beginning genuinely shocked me. I felt fear from Pennywise and his various other forms. I felt humour for Richie and the rock fight scene. I felt disgust at the molestation elements present. I felt sadness because of Georgie and his brother. This movie is amazing. Go watch it!"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Best SK movie ever. Loved every second of this film. The humor worked perfectly, and the scary parts too. The cast is just perfect (love u losers club). You should see this movie now"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "IT was the funnest time I've had in a theater in a long while. Bill Skarsgard completely and utterly kills it in his own role as Pennywise. This is coming from someone whos seen the original IT only in bits and pieces years ago. I remember IT well though and everything about this new movie is WAY better than the original. All the child actors are great. Definite Stranger Things vibe in a very good way. Finn Wolfhard was freaking hilarious. More creepy than scary yet has some frighteningly striking visuals. Sure theres some pacing/editing issues but thats it. People cant rate this movie lower because it wasnt as scary as they thought. Everyone can relate to this movie in someway, sometimes real life can be evil too. This movie is about losing your innocence as a child and having to face your fears to become an adult in order to grow up and take on life. It made me feel like a kid again. I was laughing one minute then creeped out the next all the while engaged never once getting bored. The more I think about IT the more I liked it, will be seeing again. Its big budget film making at its finest so ignore the minor issues and nitpickers and enjoy the show."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "I came into IT having read the book twice and watching (and hating) the original TV mini-series. As a fan of Stephen King\u2019s novel and the disappointment from the mini-series, I was hoping that a cinematic attempt at portraying the beloved Pennywise would definitely work. It is safe to say that not only did they achieve that, but they also made one of the best horror films to be released in the last decade.It was terrifyingly good. The CGI, while cartoony and rushed at times, looked believable still and I believe that the cartoon-style was intentional to show the psychological effect on the kids, rather than the forms IT takes being literal. Andres Muschietti did an excellent job at directing this film, especially on such a tight budget of $30 million. For context, Deadpool constantly claimed how low its budget was and how many limits it had, and they had a budget of $50 million. With a lower and tighter budget, IT exceeded all expectations and has since broken *many* records.The flow of the film is a major con for most critics, but I actually liked the switch-up of a coming-of-age story to a horror film in such low space of each other, and I liked it because it kept you on the edge of your seat the entire time, because you\u2019d never know when the horror ended or started. What I absolutely love about this film and Muschietti\u2019s directing is the subtlety.SPOILER TERRITORYI can\u2019t believe the amount of subtle horror in this film.When they were helping Ben in the alleyway, Pennywise\u2019s face was spray painted on the wall for the last few seconds of the scene, and it really brought forward the mood of the film. There were tons more; like the clown moving its head when Richie walked past, the librarian death staring Ben in the library, etc. All of these subtle horrors make the film so much more rewarding if you watch it on multiple occasions. I know I\u2019m going to go watch it a second time and then I might update my review now that I can focus on the film rather than be mesmerized.The ending was very different to the novel, as in the novel obviously the controversial scene occurs, but they did not include Pennywise turning into its true form, and the Losers\u2019 Club seeing it as a spider. Whether or not I got that mixed up with when they *spoiler alert* come back as adults, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll need to reread.I liked the gore, it really wanted that R rating. Georgie screaming before being dragged into the storm drain was really brutal and shocking. It set the tone from the very beginning and I loved every second of it. For the long runtime of 2 hours 15 minutes, it flew past.However, because of the constant switch-up between genres the story NEVER has time to breathe. The experience is so intense, and maybe a few scenes where we get to know more of the kids families would let the story have a bit of breath before bringing back Pennywise; speaking of which, that was my ONLY issue with Skarsgard\u2019s Pennywise; he had too much screentime in my opinion, and I feel that made his presence less creepy at times as we knew he was going to be there. His other forms were tremendous, and the inclusion of the Leper was superb, however Pennywise was too common and we were spoilt.I\u2019d love to rate IT \u2013 Chapter One a 9/10 based on all the points I have explained. I cannot wait for Chapter 2 and hope to see where they take the story."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "The first thing you have to understand about IT (besides that it captures the spirit and tone of a Stephen King novel better than almost any previous attempt by Hollywood) is that this isn't a horror movie as we've come to know them in recent years. It's not Saw or the Ring or even The Babadook. It's not designed to keep you afraid and disturbed for the entire runtime. This is a monster movie, a nightmarish adventure story. And because of that it's massively enjoyable, fun, tense and yes, sometimes terrifying. The pacing is perfect, the story never once drags, and the acting is aces all the way around. I felt that, at most, one or two moments were a bit indulgent or cliche, but even these blips registered as fun, not distracting or tonally inconsistent. I'm not usually a fan of horror films, but I adored the creepy, shapeshifting hell out of this movie from the script to the lush cinematography of the fictional New England setting. The filmmakers earned every penny of the astoundingly great opening weekend they had, and I hope it continues to charge along into October.
