Symbolism is often a key and interesting part in movies, but this movie outright abused it. Any so called symbolism they had, the main characters explicitly explained to the audience what it was.  Oh yeah, let us also point out that they make out in Anne Frank's room and everyone claps, because that is not strange at all!  The drawn out scenes..............please spare yourselves the agony of exposing anyone to this pathetically contrived tragedy and retain a part of your brain so that you may use it in the future."

      "text": "I have never been surrounded by so many teenage girls before until I sat down to watch this film. During an early screening of the alluring teenage film adaptation of John Green\u2019s novel The Fault In Our Stars, I was surely the minority of the sexes. To be honest, I don\u2019t think I knew exactly how outnumbered I was until the film\u2019s tragic scenes unfolded, delivering a current of waterworks and overwhelmingly loud wails of screaming, crying and sniffling, predominantly from female audience members. This early screening of the film was jam-packed, and had me sitting only a row away from the massive screen. If Josh Boone\u2019s film adaptation of The Fault In Our Stars taught me anything, it\u2019s to never underestimate the power of teenage girls and their ability to pack theaters and show their support for films and books they love.\r The Fault In Our Stars is guilty of possessing a number of faults, but its biggest sin lies in its persistence to aspire to be greater than it actually is. It succeeds when it exposes us to the tragic relationship between its protagonists and the loved ones around them, and fails when it aspires to find new territory of plot and redemption for characters that are already born with unlimited amounts of pathos.\r Hazel Grace Lancaster (Shailene Woodley) is as much a teenage girl as any other living in the United States. Her love of reality television, reading and curiosity of the taboo is just as strong as other girls within America. The only difference: Hazel Grace has terminal cancer. The Fault In Our Stars should be a film about cancer and how it effects the people surrounded by it (think 50/50), but it becomes overwhelming with its fascination to overly glamorize the telling of a tainted love story, therefore becoming a love story about people with cancer (think A Walk To Remember).\r From the beginning, love, life and happiness are overshadowed by impending doom, and that is perhaps the problem with the film. No matter how much you fall in love with Hazel Grace or Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort), their fates are sealed. Green\u2019s novel may have been about telling a heart-breaking love story between young teens, but much like Hazel\u2019s fascination with her favourite book and the open endedness of a certain literary character, Hazel\u2019s happiness is less about coming to terms with death, and more about the continuation of the life of her loved ones. The interactions with the people who will survive and live well beyond Hazel\u2019s existence are never given their due diligence on-screen, especially her mother (played delicately by Laura Dern), always being pushed aside by the love story that will ultimately end in unhappiness and tears.\r There is sure to be a reason why Green\u2019s novel has becomes such a pop culture sensation. The film is said to be a somewhat loyal adaptation, brimming with very clever metaphors of life and death through dialogue and foreshadowing. It does a masterful job of **** the most average looking parks, backyards and parking lots, and makes great use of its supporting actors. Sadly, the two actors that have the most screen time are the two weakest components of the film. Woodley, who is slowly following in the footsteps of Emma Stone and Jennifer Lawrence, seems to play Hazel Grace less, and herself more. With the exception of her chopping off her hair and having an oxygen tank follow her around everywhere she goes, Woodley only taps the surface of her character Hazel Grace, barely gracing audiences with the brilliance radiating with the promise of such a philosophically pessimistic character.\r Elgort, who comes off as a character who is easy to fall in love with, shows much of his charm and promise as a young actor. Elgort as Waters shimmers with potential, delivering a performance of a person who may be a little too cherry and perfect, given sad circumstances.\r Green had said to gain the inspiration of the novel by working as a student chaplain at a children\u2019s hospital. Drawn to the exuberant life of its terminally ill patients, Green is quoted as saying he wanted to write a book about people who were constantly being dehumanized, while showcasing the abundance of humanity in people with a terminal illness. The film does an excellent job of making audiences believe that love is what keeps Hazel and Augustus alive. Love becomes the answer, but only for so long before the inevitability of death at the end of a terminal illness takes hold. There is a point where love exists, and people fade in the film, and although the relationships that held strong are bonded by love, hope of an improbably oblivion becomes the films main concern.\r The Fault In Our Stars can be self-assured as being a quality film made for an audience that would be content with half-assed filmmaking. The production quality and storytelling is top-notch, even if its is constantly emotionally manipulating."

And really, why they aren't necessarily equal, none of them can be considered subplots; \"co-plots\" is a more apt term.\r The curse is the weight of it all. A terminal teenage girl reconciling her own mortality is heavy but believable. A terminal teenage girl falling in love is heavy but believable. A terminal teenage girl seeking answers to lingering questions in her favorite book is heavy but believable. Each, on its own, could fill 90 minutes of movie. But all three combined carry too much weight, and thus strain credulity to its breaking point. More than once I found myself asking, \"What other terrible thing could happen?\" only to be answered within the next 10 minutes."

      "text": "Intrinsically dishonest whilst purporting to be the definitive truth about living and dying with cancer. This is objectionable on nearly every level. Based on a best selling book it can claim as its own a lead female character who is, oh so, with it and everyone calls her by, not one, but two names- Hazel Grace, if you will! It also has a cool male lead and we know this because he goes around with an unlit cigarette between his teeth as a metaphor for life and death. So far, so vomit inducing, and that's just for starters. The screenplay and dialogue is so saccharine that diabetes sufferers should steer well clear.\rShailene Woodley, reminding one of a young Debra Winger in her manner, is obviously capable of handling better material, but is only ok under such unfair circumstances. However, in the male lead Ansel Elgort is just annoying. The film is also desperately overlong and the scenes involving Willem Dafoe just don't work at all. We are also treated to an embarrassing first kiss between the two leads in the Anne Frank house in Amsterdam, which actually has the other visitors applauding and tips the film into bathos.\rThe lack of empathy one feels for the characters is also underlined by a syrupy score and some of the worst songs to be heard in a film for quite some time. At one point Woodley says that a nurse once asked her on a scale of 1-10 where she would rate her pain. I would have to disagree with her 9 and say my pain level was at the 10 mark. This is the sort of film you wish they didn't make anymore and the critics that have praised it, enticing my viewing, leave me baffled."

      "text": "Life comes at us in full swing.. 24/7, we never know the boundaries of our limitations always taking things further and beyond anything we, as society, imagine. I'm not a typical schultz when it comes to sappy romantic novels, or love stories of any genre. To be honest, they inflame me. Setting up unrealistic approaches to how \"love\" is supposed to be.\rIn the end, someone is left dead or crying. Now, before I start to sound like a weeping school girl, I give you the film \"The Fault In Our Stars\" which I must say.. is a rare, rare exception. A film that never exploits itself too much, and has relentless humor that perfectly balances the fatal backdrop. I have not read the acclaimed novel from author John Green. However, In the days leading up to this screening, I had heard nothing but positive things about the book. It's clear now after seeing the film, what a tremendous band of characters, and a touching story that Green has vastly created..and to him I say well done.\r The movie chronicles the events of Hazel Grace Lancaster, a sixteen year old, dealing with the everyday struggle of living with her terminal (but treatable) cancer. With no friends and nothing look to forward to in life, The film also follows the unforgettable journey of love when she meets Augustus Waters, a likeable and pretentious eighteen year old that is persistent and charming. The two instantly hit it off, and form a bond that is unbreakable. To the point that nothing can separate them. Co-existing in each others lives, and finding the true meaning of each other.\r We can't have this film, if not for our stunning and talented leads. You may remember the pair as on screen siblings in the film adaptation of \"Divergent\" that came out earlier this year. But, \"true\" audience members are going to remember them for playing, Hazel Grace Lancaster, and Augustus Waters. I'm talking about Shailene Woodley, and her trustful leading man Ansel Elgort. The two are miraculous to watch on screen together, easily the best chemistry between any romance since, Rachel McAdams & Ryan Gosling in \"The Notebook\". (Yes I've seen that movie too...shocking I know). Ansel Elgort is truly coming into his own as a delicate performer. However, this time around the film belongs to Woodley and her mastery of Hazel Grace. So much passion, so much raw material infused into her grief stricken performance, that ..dare I say.. brought me to tears. Hazel is such a fragile character, and you understand this within the opening credits. The mental stability and such all seemed to come natural to Woodly, whom made me feel so much within a two hour time frame. Great supporting work also comes from long time favorite Willem Dafoe, as well as, Laura Dern, Nat Wolff and Sam Trammell. They round out the film and make it feel whole.\r Woodley was undoubtedly good...yes, but we can't say it's nothing without Ansel Elgort and his charismatic charm, memorable metaphors and wit he brings to the character of Augustus Waters. In addition, this film is only going to be as good are your two leads, and that's usually where the problem lies, this is never the case in this film. Director Josh Boone gets the most out of his performers and writers Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Webber do the justice (I believe) is deserved. Of course, as history would have it, I assume the book is better.\r In Comparison we look at other films like \"The Vow\", \"Safe Haven\" and even \"Endless Love\" ..was there anything here to create a likeable basis?..that didn't stumble into a crate of dumbfoundedness..and horrendous stupidity?. Those films are not love stories..there simply are films attempting to create one. Besides a film like \"The Notebook\", and \"The Fault In Our Stars\" only come along every so often.. It's sad that a film like \"The Vow\" was based on an actual true story..and. do in heavy to the belligerents of the director and cast, I didn't believe it for a second. Our Director, Josh Boone takes these giant cliches and simply washes away with them, inflicting some strong emotional damage, and a film you think about long after leaving your local multiplex.\r Anyone that has ever dealt with cancer, the loss of a loved one, anything tough of this latitude in general will feel a resounding connection with this film. Even for folks that haven't read the book (like myself). \"The Fault In Our Stars\" is deeply moving and swiftly upbeat all the same, which is saying alot for me. The movie perfectly balances it's tough subject matter. The only problem I couldn't get over..was that Shailene Woodley did look a little too older to be playing a quote on quote \"sixteen year old\", which didn't ruin the film..it just hurt the credibility a little bit.\r As stated earlier, it's extremely rare to come across such a love story that can evoke a genuine feel that doesn't seem dated or overly excessive. A story that is entertaining but not preachy. You either buy into it, or you don't. Thanks to strong leads, a bunch of talented crew members, writers and directors that brought this all together. \"The Fault In Our Stars\" works on a grander scale as a whole, and if this film doesn't pull on your heartstrings. I don't know what will.\r A\r By: Nate Adams\r Directed By: Josh Boone\rRated: PG13\rRuntime: 126 mins\rStudio: Fox\rRelease Date: June 6th 2014\r Thanks For Stopping By."

It\u2019s the best book to movie adaptation I\u2019ve seen in a long time. I say this because it avoids both book and movie clich\u00e9s, nicely, while offering a fresh look at the teen\u2019 romance genre.\r Director, Josh Boone tells the story of a sixteen-year-old cancer patient played flawlessly by Shailene Woodley. Woodley\u2019s character is forced to attend a support group where she meets a boy. They quickly become friends and we watch as their relationship blossoms into something more. The boy-meets-girl plot may be old, but it\u2019s far from stale.\r Gripping, realistic characters and down to earth stories helped ground the messages in this movie. Never once did the ideas brought up in the film feel forced. The creators did an excellent job at leaving the big questions about life up to the interpretation of the viewers. Yet enough of the simple plot points were answered to leave us satisfied.\r The acting was brilliant and made the whole film work. Each character was likable and had arcs; whether they were important to the story or not, they were still entertaining.  The dialogue was realistic throughout the movie, creating an immersive experience that carried viewers into the world of the characters.\r Unfortunately, the film did suffer some off-beat moments and a few scenes felt slightly prolonged. There were also a handful of tear-jerking scenes toward the end, that came across as forced.\r The Fault in Our Stars offers great performances that are well worth the watch, and the heartfelt story is one that will make you stop and evaluate life. Put this film on your must-watch list of 2014."

He's just a two movie old and now the movie goers can expect eagerly for his next venture. This movie was based on the teen novel of the same name about a 16-years-old cancer patient.\r Hazel Grace, who is battling between life and death is also a strong fighter against all the odds. When her mother sends her to attend the group therapy she meets Augustus Water, a fellow member. As she is being sarcastic, Waters finds an interesting character in her. A friendship develops and they spend more time together. Even knowing there will no future together, the relationship progress and how everything ends is the rest.\r Usually cancer themed movies are called tearjerker films. Surprisingly, this movie's aim was different. Of course emotion strikes, but the story narration and character developments were the basic goal. Three-fourth of the movie was well told story about teen romance. The afterwards account begins with a twist which were portrayed in the usual manner. Like all the movies, kept sentiments in the last part. The last quarter was very predictable, but they avoided cliche as much possible.\r \u2018\u2018Apparently, the world is not\ra wish-granting factory.\u2019\u2019\r The parents' role was kind of mysterious one, that diverts viewer from their anticipation. Interesting it also creates some doubts. Compared to the previous movie 'The Spectacular Now', Shailene Woodley looked completely different. That means the physical transformed to look a perfect 16 year old was amazing. Her performance as well gives an impression that the Hollywood's future Academy award grabbing the female lead is on making. At this rate she can do that like Jennifer Lawrence did.\r As for the lead actor, it is a good breakthrough and expecting the same result from his next movie as well. This movie, which runs over a 2 hour was smartly sliced the contents and organized those on the right spots. Many had agreed it was a fine cinema transformation from a book. So you can try this, but be careful because nowadays most of the teens movies are overrated because of the overwhelmed teen audience. The warning meant only for the older people. I'm sure the youngster will love this movie, I mean most of them."

This one sort of attempts both. But while the subject of the film is sad as it is, considering that things like those happen every day, I don't want to rate the subject of the film but rather the film itself as a work of art.\r Cancer is a bad beast, if you want to know more about it, there's a lot of people around you who have it and can tell you."

Shailene Woodley was passable and Ansel Elgort had his moments, but ultimately they both left me feeling like somebody else could have done it better."

      "text": "\u201cThe Fault in Our Stars\u201d is the love story of Hazel and Augustus, two teenagers with terminal cancer who meet in a support group. It is based on a book by the same title written by John Green.\r Hazel, played by Shailene Woodley, and Augustus, played by Ansel Elgort have two completely different characters. Hazel is very pessimistic, depressed, asocial, and melancholic. Augustus is optimistic, cheerful, convivial, and funny. As their love story progresses their characters change. Hazel starts to see bright sides of the world and Augustus gives up his super ambitious dreams and becomes more realistic.\r Not every director is brave enough to step into the territory of showing the daily life of terminally ill people but this territory is also easily manipulative. Josh Boone should be praised for his courage for directing \u201cThe Fault in Our Stars\u201d and puts many engaging moments and a good takeaway message in the movie but it does not mean his work has no shortcomings.\r The main problem with the movie is the poor script adaptation. The movie relies less on the visual presentations and more on Hazel's monologues to narrate the story. Instead of seeing events in the movie, we mostly hear them (or we see them and then unnecessarily hear them).  A better script adaptation could have transformed more of the oral narrations into more engaging visual narrations. Moreover, clich\u00e9 sentences like \u201cI love you\u201d and \u201cYou are beautiful\u201d appear in the movie over and over without adding anything new to the story. The ultimate message of the movie is excessively highlighted with excessive dialogues and performances.\r The second problem with this movie is far-from-perfect performances. The supporting actors and actresses in the movie pull out good performances but the leading actor and actress are not convincing. The Augustus' ever-present smile and his never-disturbed coolness feels unreal and sometimes annoying. Still, it seems the script is to blame here. Performances are not the only part of the movie that feel fake and unreal. The whole story about Hazel and Augustus's last wish and how they consummate their love is so fake that I couldn't help but to keep closing my eyes through it."

      "text": "All emotions aside, this movie was worth the watch, but solely for entertainment and tear-jerking purposes. This movie does not deserve a perfect 10 (it's no 12 Years a Slave or Pulp Fiction), but it does deserve some credibility where it earned it\u2014 the cinematography and the acting,  most notably. Both leads did a wonderful job selling their characters. Unfortunately, however (and this may just be a critique of the book rather than the movie), the plot was somewhat flawed. For one, the movie (unlike the book) didn't explain why the father wasn't more of a prominent figure, whereas the mother was heavily involved. That's a simple flaw, and not one worth giving a lower score for. What does alter my score, however, are the multiple plot cliches found throughout the movie, as well as film cliches. There was, of course!, the typical 'grab something at the same time and touch our hands \"accidentally\" ' cliche. What I do commemorate is the slight plot twist: (DON'T READ THIS SENTENCE IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE OR READ THE BOOK) most people would probably assume that Hazel would die, rather than Gus. So that was a nice gut-buster. Overall, apart from the cliches and ultimate goal of causing the audience to flood the theater in their own tears, the movie was entertaining and inspiring (as well as the book, obviously). It reminds me of Perks of Being a Wallflower, but not quite as good. It was an interesting take on a 21st century coming-of-age film (which is how I understood it to be, but with a touch of cancer). As a film, this movie deserves between a 5.5-6.5; as modern entertainment, this movie deserves an 8-9. Recommended but not praised."

This movie doesn't feel any emotional for any of the characters as well but  one of the good things of this movie is the fact that the relationship here works but i didn't care of any of the characters . The story is cliche and the ending as well the girl who loves the guy dies as always which is completely annoying so the movie is not sad at all they told me that the movie is extremely sensitive but that ain't affect me not even a bit but sorry for the fans but my score is average"

      "text": "\"The Fault In Our Stars\" 10 Scale Rating: 7.0 (Good) ...\r The Good: Despite an over-abundance of sap, the film definitely has it's share of solid and genuinely touching moments. The leads are well characterized and fleshed out, with snappy dialogue that makes them mostly likeable. There is also obvious chemistry between the leads (Ansel Elgort, Shailene Woodley), which is a must for a film like this. Perhaps the best performance of the film comes from Willem Dafoe who plays a miserable and reclusive writer that the lead couple idolize. You know going in that there is a tragedy in the film, and despite guessing what was going to happen, it was so well done that it still had an impact regardless.\r The Bad: The sap is overbearing at times and feels non-stop. It was almost like they were shouting at you and saying \" We WILL find SOMETHING to make you FEEL!\" The leads eventually wear on you and their wit and off-beat humor get old. I found myself wanting them to just shut up during some of the scenes."

Well, If I had a movie rental service, It would have it's own genre called: \"Feel sorry for me/Oh! Gross! Blah!\" and would be rated \"T\" (terrible).\r Bassically It's about this girl with lung cancer and a guy with lip cancer (I think) and (SUPRISE!) they fall in love with each other and do things that should NOT be mentioned in this review (Oh, gross).\r I do NOT reccomend buying, renting, or even PIRATING this movie, as it is terrible.\r 1/10"
