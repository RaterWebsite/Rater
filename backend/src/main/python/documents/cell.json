It's clear the original King story it's based on has some interesting takes on the zombie genre (and at the time of its writing was timely in regards to cell phones zombifying our culture) but this film cannot muster any energy towards exploring those or doing anything but marching heedlessly forward towards a \"conclusion\"."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "They took a best-selling novel, added big-name actors to the project, and made what comes off as a B movie.  It just looks shoddily made and the \"zombies\" look plain silly. Comical, actually. I love the zombie genre but the most poignant criticism I read of this film is that it \"lacks a pulse.\"  Making a play on words about the cell phone pulse that makes people killer maniacs.  Because this one doesn't give much of a thrill.  It's pretty bad when they make a movie that is supposed to scare people and they laugh at it."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Cell completely fails on almost every level. It's poorly directed, it looks bad, has phoned in performances (save for Samuel L. Jackson and Stacey Keach) it's a shockingly bad script from Stephen King, and it's just confusing and poorly paced.

The beginning can also be pleasant, but after just ten minutes the film begins to give the viewer a disappointment after another.

This movie has a pretty good director and based on the novel by  Stephen King with a stars like John Cusack and Samuel L.

It was a little tough screening it when the folks watching with you end up laughing at the first 10 minutes of the movie.  I always thought that John Cusack chose really good projects.

Im not going to spoil the movie but the ending is so damn terrible that it made me laugh how terrible it was. The zombies are laughable bad and not scary but they are funny.

Overall i feel bad for Stephen King."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Another bad Stephen King adaptation, even worse when you realise Mr King wrote the screenplay.  Though it's the direction of the film which makes this dull and boring.  It's too short to do the book justice... and the novel wasn't that good.  Only Samuel L Jackson and Stacy Keach put any emotion into their characters.  Nice idea badly produced."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "The \"trolololol\" song is played extensively during a scene in this movie. Not sure if it's coincidence, or if it's the filmmakers laughing hysterically at their audience, who were hopeful they'd be getting a good Stephen King movie. Either way, this movie belongs in a cell."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Stephen King is quoted as saying that cell phones are \"21st-century slave bracelets,\" and frankly I guessed this might be so while watching \"Cell,\" based on his novel. If you like anything that hints of a zombie apocalypse then you might regard the film as passably OK.  It has some problems.  It's about non-zombie-type zombies.  They do certain things that seem impossible.  Admittedly, zombie flicks are all about the impossible but \"Cell\" provides no real explanation for how the impossible is achieved or what's really going on and in the end it all seems kind of half-assed.  The acting is OK but even Samuel L. Jackson, John Cusack, and Stacy Keach aren't enough to make this tepid production particularly watchable.  Frankly, I'd suggest trying out \"The Signal\" (2007) instead, a very low-budget non-zombie zombie indie that makes characters stand out."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "It started off pretty well but quickly went downhill. The acting was decent and the movie was overall kind of entertaining but the movie was very stupid, filled with horrible CGI and had a pretty bad ending.

Otherwise, I would recommend something else."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "OK movie but very disappointing!\rCould had been far better film instead!\rIt had all the potentials to be phenomenal horror movie but it just failed big time sadly."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "The problem with the movie isn't it's cast (Most of whom give pretty good performances), the low budget, or even it's rather derivative zombie movie formula. It's the writing. This is a very unsatisfying adaptation of the book. The movie is at it's best when it's using scenes straight from the source material. This just doesn't happen very much at all. We see familiar bits and pieces along the way, but for the most part the movie largely does it's own thing, and poorly at that.Those who have read the book will know that it wasn't your average zombie story. King infused the apocalyptic scenario with his unique sense of imagination. The \"Phoners\" were gifted psychic powers, connected by a hive mind, and led by a menacing Phoner of higher intelligence and a thirst for vengeance. The movie touches on those elements, but fails to use them to any satisfying results. They're just sort of there and only serve to confuse those who didn't read the book and tick off those who did with how ineptly they are handled. The plot itself is also only a hollow imitation of the real thing. I understand the obvious budgetary restraints would have prevented an entirely faithful adaptation, but they certainly could have done better than this. It follows the overall outline of the book's plot to a degree, but it's filled in with original moments. None of which are good. All the original stuff is just badly written, particularly where the dialog is concerned. It's all a mad rush to a crappy conclusion. The interesting and important bits are skipped over in favor of a whole lot of nothing. You want to know the really shocking part about all of this? It was written by Stephen King himself. He butchered his own book onscreen! Stick to the books King, because you just proved that you can't write a good movie. Now, I could have dealt with the less than faithful adaptation of the book provided the original stuff was good, but it's not. For my fellow fans of the book, I highly recommend skipping this one. It doesn't do the source material justice at all. As for those without knowledge of the book, but are hoping for a solid zombie flick, also look elsewhere. It's just a bad movie.4.5/10"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "An original story line, the use of cell phones to make people \"crazy\" or \"zombies\" or something.

It's a mess throughout and lacks any tension, freshness or uniqueness.Cusack and Jackson should be a good pairing, yet I don't even recall anything from their respective performances just minutes after watching. Both are capable of a lot better than this, especially Jackson. No-one sticks out behind that duo, though it's neat to see 'Prison Break' actor Stacy Keach involved.One to avoid, I'd say."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Using your phone turns you into a zombie but a group of \"normals\" are walking up North to do...something."}], "recommendations": ["dreamcatcher", "the_mist", "ghost_rider_spirit_of_vengeance", "the_thing", "i_am_legend", "the_day_the_earth_stood_still", "indiana_jones_and_the_kingdom_of_the_crystal_skull", "hellbound_hellraiser_ii", "halloween_iii_season_of_the_witch", "book_of_shadows_blair_witch_2", "eragon", "see_no_evil", "doctor_strange_in_the_multiverse_of_madness", "from_dusk_till_dawn", "the_grudge_2", "world_war_z", "percy_jackson_sea_of_monsters", "the_twilight_saga_eclipse", "army_of_the_dead", "van_helsing", "the_happening", "the_amityville_horror", "jonah_hex", "poltergeist", "suicide_squad"]}
