You probably heard of all the 'Chinatown' and 'Inception' comparisons, but this neo-noir attempt is absolutely boring and uninspiring. It reminded me of 'Gattaca', and made me appreciate it even more because this is just bad at so many levels. You'll stop caring about the plot halfway or before."

It evens mirrors and contains casts from Joy's other work, which was superior mind you: Westworld.  Despite its stellar leads, this is Lisa Joy's first effort as a Director and it shows. Sure, she has all the best support staffs: but the film feels like a very long TV movie, and a good fit on HBO Max but not the cinemas."

Those ideas aren't bad at all, it's just that you can do a movie for each of them instead of cooking all those ingredients together. The actors are pretty good in the movie. The FX are impressive. The action is minimal. The best action is surely the hand fight in the end. The singing is great but the soundtrack isn't always with the scenes. I found the rhythm to be a bit slow. I give it 53%. I think Lisa Joy can definitively do better, but you see that she didn't exactly do a nice transition between Tv to movie."

      "text": "From the masterminds behind HBO's Westworld comes this sad return to the action genre for Hugh Jackman.The mix that it was presenting, sounded pretty good and looked pretty good, but the mystery conjured up in this tale is actually really poor and mostly unattractive.I'll be honest, halfway through, I really stopped caring what the hell happened to Rebecca Ferguson's character, and it turned out even worse when it revealed how terribly simplistic her fate was.Reminiscence has all the structure and semblance of being a great science fiction blockbuster, even with its relatively modest budget, and if you only look at the facade.However in a cruel joke with its title, it's reminiscent of many other films, and ultimately the puzzle it asks us to put together is just very simplistic.And the intrigue delivered isn't enough to want to go all the way until the end.But hey, we got to see Hugh Jackman for the second time acting completely infatuated by seeing Rebecca Ferguson singing."

Which is explained by remembering that the director is the co-author of \"Westworld\" (the TV series) and, above all, that she produces together with her husband Jonathan Nolan. Therefore it is spelt \"Reminiscence\" but it is pronounced, once again, \"Memento\" with its convoluted reflections on the three temporal extensions and on love as catabasis and anabasis."

The project is not bold enough and some risks should have been taken considering the futuristic semi-post apocalyptic context where the overall mood is too sanitized and proper. The bad guy character played by Daniel Wu is out of subject, limit hilarious, and should have been replaced by Sam Medina who has much more charisma and fits the part perfectly. Overall, we feel the Nolan family influence and understand a directing job and deal were given by relationship and political context of diversity and inclusion\u2026 which excludes prioritizing talent which is common mistake by studios nowadays. A huge budget for a deception at its level."

      "text": "Is 'Reminiscence' good or bad? But I would rather go for a mixed review. Reminiscence is not bad at all but however it didn't went in a proper way as expected. The story revolves around Nick Bannister(Hugh Jackman), a private investigator who also helps in recovering his clients lost memories along with his friend Emily(Thandie Newton). He suddenly fells in love with one of his client Mae(Rebecca Ferguson). But one day she disappears and Nick begins to search for her which leads him into the criminal underworld of Miami where he uncovers an unknown truth about Mae which starts haunting him. The movie ended in an emotional bittersweet way where some might say it as happy while others will go for a sad one(I again vote for the mixed one) . The movie started off somewhat excellently engrossing us with it's concept of reminiscence but after some time it started to falter and became boring. But there are some nicely layed ideas from director Lisa Joy but failed to make it's mark due to poor execution of the movie. It is good to see Hugh Jackman after a long break and I should say he played his part very well. The acting was good and the dyastopian setting of a flooding Miami was awesome. But other than that there is nothing to it except for some good imaginations and ideas. Director Lisa Joy tried to come up with an interesting movie but somehow it failed to make an impression. However it's her debut directorial and in that way she had given her best efforts. So let's come to the question is 'Reminiscence' worth watching. It cannot be said as worth watching but anyway it can be seen as a simple weekend romantic thriller which we can just watch and forget."

The casting is off, the writing needed work to better fit the actors and the directing was not effective.  And, I guess other things like editing and cinematography where good but were not excellent.If Lisa Joy wants to take a bigger role in producing her work, she should seek professionals who can help her.One last thing - Hugh Jackman is a good actor - but, I'm not a huge fan.  He did not quite fit the role just right.  Perhaps it was not entirely his fault.  Perhaps Lisa Joy got off on the wrong foot when Hugh Jackman was cast in the lead role.I'll add that I add just finished watching a very dark Nordic-noir detective series just before I watched PG-13 rated Reminiscence.  The stark difference between the two, especially with Hugh Jackman and his comic-book level charisma, made Reminiscence seem more of a teenager level material and less substantial and serious."

Might be her ridiculous take on Dune (she claims the script had to be doctored for 21st century audiences because obviously any male writer from the 60s is sexist, even though she admits to not only NOT reading it, but unable to understand the few pages she did. She laughingly admits to needing her male costars to explain it to her . LMAO, she needed mansplaining, ROFL). The rest is just a bland sci-fi noire that tries to be Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind? Boring romance scenes over and over. I guess there's a warning g about climate change in there. It's a dud despite Jackman's likeability and Newtins sex appeal."

Needless to say, this includes danger, murder and conspiracy. While it\u2019s sufficiently interesting, the story or direction never grip the emotions or surprise expectations (and some of the tech fails logic). With the constant voiceover and a reality altered by a failing environment, the film harkens back to the original Blade Runner. The movie\u2019s coolest feature is Miami\u2019s partially submerged underwater world (the piano fight scene is the visual highlight).

      "text": "It's truly disappointing when a film starts off with great potential but then squanders its viewer-earned goodwill as the story unfolds. So it is with director Lisa Joy's debut feature, a future noir offering that mixes sci-fi, romance and mystery in a blend that draws from films like \"Blade Runner,\" \"Brainstorm,\" \"Inception,\" \"Total Recall,\" \"Elysium\" and \"Deja Vu.\" In a war-ravaged, environmentally degraded version of Miami in which depressed residents escape their troubles by recalling cherished memories thanks to sophisticated mind-tapping technology, a former Navy interrogator who runs a business providing this service finds himself caught up in a steamy romance with a mysterious femme fatale who suddenly disappears without a trace. But, in his attempt to locate her, he unwittingly finds himself caught up in a web of drug trafficking and corruption, circumstances that he would have been better off leaving alone. It's when the film turns from stylish romance to crime saga that the picture starts getting bogged down in too many plot tangents, underdeveloped story threads and conventionality, all of which undermine what this release had going for it at the outset. To be sure, the romantic and sci-fi elements of this story generally work well, but the more conventional aspects of the story intrude far too much, taking away from the overall viability of the production. The filmmaker shows promise with this debut, but future projects call for better judgment when it comes to determining what works and what doesn't."

      "text": "Hugh Jackman and Rebecca Ferguson have teamed up again to star in a neo-noir style sci-fi drama that is reminiscent of other movies like Strange Days, Inception and Blade Runner. Nick Bannister (Hugh Jackman) is a private investigator of the mind, navigating the alluring world of memories and nostalgia. His life changes forever when he meets a new client, Mae (Rebecca Ferguson). What begins as a simple case soon becomes an obsession for Nick after Mae suddenly disappears and he desperately tries to learn the truth and if she really was the woman he thought she was.It\u2019s entertaining and enjoyable to watch in the moment. There might be a bit of a missed opportunity here as there is a lot going on and perhaps the most impressive thing about Reminiscence is the world building it has created. Set in a dystopian future where due to the devastating effects of global warming many parts of the city is either underwater or badly flooded. The city only opens up at night due to the extreme heat during the daytime, this very much adds to the neo-noir theme. The ultra-rich have built dams allowing them to live comfortably in the drylands, leaving the poorer members of society to live in the flooded remains of the city. There\u2019s enough storylines here about class division and corrupt police to expand on but it\u2019s limited to a two hour movie. I liked it but the main story does feel like something we\u2019ve seen before. From a technical point of view Reminiscence is very impressive and clearly in the hands of a director (Lisa Joy) who knows what she\u2019s doing. The fight scenes are well done and very clear, no shaky cam anywhere which is always a bonus. Also added to the cast are Thandiwe Newton and Cliff Curtis, both giving impressive performances. I\u2019m not surprised to see Jackman and Ferguson appear again in another movie after their onscreen chemistry in The Greatest Showman. However, unlike The Greatest Showman Rebecca Ferguson actually has the chance to show off her impressive vocals in Reminiscence. The soundtrack is worth listening to, both for Ferguson\u2019s seductive singing and Ramin Djawadi\u2019s original score.I felt nostalgic watching Reminiscence, which considering the film\u2019s topic is very appropriate. Recommended for the Hugh Jackman and Rebecca Ferguson fans."

With all this, it's easy to believe that a plot point will not be resolved, but I found them all wrapped up well to my satisfaction.The scenery was also well done. The movie considers a near future where rising sea levels have overtaken coastal cities, but not to the point that people can't live in them. This is not a major story point, and instead, it simply provides an aesthetic to the movie. The sea is always present -- whether brushed up against buildings with their first floors submerged, or covering the local roads, but not enough to make them unusable. The sun reflects across these features beautifully in many scenes, and it provides an almost fantasy-like setting for the story to be told. I ultimately can't say I liked Reminiscence simply because it made me sad. But when I try to remove that feeling from my head and consider this movie on its own merits, I find that it was well done."

Anyway, this weekend a new movie premiered in theaters and on HBO Max, Reminiscence. Also known as The Jade Earring, Reminiscence is a mystery/thriller/love story that follows Hugh Jackman as Nick Bannister, a private investigator of the mind as he navigates the alluring world of the past when his life is changed by new client Mae. A simple case becomes an obsession after she disappears and he fights to learn the truth about her.I know what you're already thinking. An investigator of the mind?! Yes, it's reminiscent of an all time great, Inception. Is this a review within a review within a review? No. We are just talking about how Reminiscence has borrowed a storyline but with a strangely unoriginal while nicely executed story. And by nicely executed, I don't mean how slowly this movie unravels so obviously. I mean who doesn't love a who done it? The story unfolds in a way that you feel each character. I found myself either lusting after Mae (Rebecca Ferguson) or eagerly seeking answers like Hugh. One might say that was just the actors doing a really good job, which I won't deny. Let's not talk about how Thandie Newtown was grossly misused and underutilized. I also think it is a testament to how generally good the direction and the writing are. With that said, I feel like the movie could have been cut a bit to make it quicker and more hard hitting. Of course, there are times where we need to linger but there were definitely times where the movie held on too long to a part we don't really care about.The biggest misstep of this movie comes with the scenery though. Why in the heck did the world need to have water everywhere?! Honestly, this movie only had one cool scene in the water and the rest of the movie could've been dry. It sticks out like a sore thumb and quite frankly makes zero sense. Why does everyone have to have soggy socks and athlete's foot? Sorry, I may be looking at this too realistically but the water setting is the biggest why the heck was this necessary at the end of the movie. The other misstep of this movie is that while the twist and turns of the story are pretty good, the result is just so unsatisfying. I feel like there was no payoff at the end of the movie. The movie does give a nice, loving ending, but the chase for the Maltese falcon of who done it was just so... who cares.Reminiscence, at the end of the day, is a solid seductive toxic relationship with an okay who done it. The actors make the movie worth watching with their chemistry and delivery. Yet, at the end of the day, half of the movie seems completely unimportant. Reminiscence is a nice ride for a streaming movie, but I could see how a moviegoer would be disappointed. Streamers grab yourself a bowl while those of you loving the movie theaters again don't brave the Delta for this flick but run to HBO Max."

      "text": "Reminiscence (2021) is a sci-fi noir thriller and is a directorial feature film debut of Lisa Joy, the co-creator of Westworld alongside her husband Jonathan Nolan. She also directed one of my favourite episodes from Season 2. It is set in a not-so-distant future Miami where the world has been subject to rising sea levels wreaking havoc. Memory tech is a craze where one can relive their cherished moments from the past and Hugh Jackman's character is running a business of it alongside his friend played by Thandiwe Newton. Things go awry when a customer, played by Rebecca Furgeson, goes missing and Hugh's character takes it upon himself to find her. I was curious to check this out and sadly it was disappointing.The movie is competently made for the most part i.e the sets, the production design, the CGI, sound effects and music, the pacing, the cinematography, the acting, are all executed well enough that you get the feeling of a proper good looking and sounding movie. It's in the writing and story department where it falters and drags the entire experience down from being a good or even great one to a middling one at best.The movie mixes in different ideas and concepts, none of them new, and while on their own they are cool, when blended together with the story you get, it doesn't work nearly as well as there is a lack of energy and urgency that you don't really get throughout. You are experiencing the story play out and it's kinda OK but it never goes beyond that.There is superficial depth to the themes and ideas where the movie thinks it is being deep and poignant but you don't really get that feeling. It's just sorta there. Not to mention the fact that the entire plot hinges on a romance that was hardly developed so you don't get that connection which should hook you.Take out the competency in other elements and high profile actors and this would be bad but since those things are present, it goes up a few notches, so props to Lisa Joy for that at least and hopefully her next outing will be better. Rebecca Furgeson's beauty alone kinda pushes it one point above for me not gonna lie, it is what it is. Simply put, it was just OK. Disappointed cause it could have been a lot more. Maybe if Jonathan Nolan was helping with the script, that would have been the case, who knows. Not recommended but hey, if you are curious, give it a shot. And if I were to rate it, I'd give it a 6/10."
