There's several things that could be improved (the ending is somewhat anti-climatic), but it's a step in the right direction and had many moments that made me and my family happy. Even if you're not a huge Harry Potter fan (like myself), there's tons for you to enjoy."

Rowling doesn't have enough material for this prequel saga and she's basically filling in the gaps with what she can.With this third instalment, the total absence of direction is the constant feature of what we are seeing on screen.With the exception of a more action-focused tone, a distinctly fascist flavor clearly inspired by our present day that is infused into the character of Gellert Grindelwald, and that Mads Mikkelsen playing him is a monumental improvement over Johnny Depp; Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore is an improvement over its predecessor, but it's also another disappointing addition to the franchise of the Wizarding World that fails to capture the magic and grace that made the Harry Potter films so famous."

Not cramming it in here. Each film has got progressively worse, god help the final two films.But I\u2019m tapped out now, no more money wasted on this."

When Johnny depp was playing the character it just didn\u2019t feel real, he just looked to insane for it to look like Dumbledore actually fell for him. (If that makes sense). Mads Mikkelsen did a great job in portraying his character. Mads already had the kind of charm and look that the character needed, he didn\u2019t have to change his whole appearance to look like the character aged up. I get that the character is supposed to have white hair but it makes more sense for the character to look older and not exactly how he is supposed to look. Anyways, I watched this movie with some of my friends and we totally enjoyed it. It had such a good plot and you would never get bored. The movie had a bit of everything romance, adventure, thrill, ect. I 100% recommend it and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have a great time!"

It leaves you with something in your heart when you go out from the cinema. It is at the same time adventurous and deeply emotional, with powerful scenes, beautiful settings, funny moments, wonderful characters, but, first of all, a strong focus on the depths of human heart and the struggles which can take place in it. It is a movie about the choice between what we desire and what we have to do. The tormented love story between Dumbledore and Grindelwald, lying at the core of the movie, is poetic and heartbreaking, with the taste of a Greek tragedy. Jude Law and Mad Mikelsen are gigantic in their performances and have an incredibile chemistry together.They seem to have been born to play these two unhappy, torn lovers/foes. Watched the movie twice and I will soon watch it a third time. I warmly raccomend it! Don't let you  be dissuaded by negative critics and Rowling haters.  Go and watch this movie...and judge by yourselves!"

I mainly wanted to write this review to coin the term \"Vote Goat\" in reference to the little creature who decides the electoral process based on who it deems pure of heart. Dear god help us if a character written by J.K. Rowling is the one judging people's characters. The refusal to bring back Johnny Depp after the hell he's been through is very telling of the absolute horror show that is J.K.'s empty shell of a heart.Also, the Dumbledore/ Grindelvold dynamic is literally just Professor X and Magneto. I know that old crone watched those movies and then had an unrelated dream in which she invented it, but it's not subtle, nor is it remotely even as well fleshed out.Also also, they added the Mirror Dimension from Doctor Strange, and I know that's where the idea came from, because they cast the bad guy from Doctor Strange in the movie.Also also also, the previous movie ended on a cliffhanger where the bad guy wants to, in a roundabout way, prevent the holocaust. So, the entire subtext of this film includes our wacky heroes actively trying to stop the bad guy from preventing the holocaust. Just a fun note that is also very telling of how much of a garbage human being Ms. Rowling is. If you need a reminder, she's the same lady who wrote a slave race into her children's books and said it was okay to leave them enslaved because they \"liked it.\"Even worse than Morbius."
