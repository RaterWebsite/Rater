However, the songs are beautiful, the actors are amazing and the sets, scenery and colours of the film are really luxurious. The theme is such a refreshing change, all about the Bohemian revolution and their beliefs of beauty, freedom, truth and love, overcoming everything. This movie is perfect. No faults from me!"

The technical aspect of the film is extraordinary: amazing film editing, breath-taking cinematography, perfect music and just overall an excellently made film. The actors, though, make the film what it is. Nicole Kidman is ABSOLUTELY PERFECT as Satine, and has become my favourite actress ever since I first watched this masterpiece. One of the best performances I've ever seen on-screen: she sings, she dances, she dies. Perfect summary. But it's also so much more! And Ewan McGregor - who would have thought he could sing like that??? Amazing voice and one just falls in love with him. The supporting cast is also brilliant, especially Jim Broadbent who deservingly took the BAFTA award home for 'Moulin Rouge.'Overall, Moulin Rouge is an eye-candy film for people who truly believe in freedom, beauty, truth, and above all things - love."

That all changed when a little mad man from down under named Baz Luhrman helmed his attempt at \"An English Language Bollywood-style re-imagining of La Traviata using contemporary songs\". We expected a train wreck. What we got was one of the most original, striking, and heartbreaking romantic films of all time. Who doesn't still swoon when Christian sings \"Your Song\"?"

The fact the entire cast sang throughout the whole movie was marvelous in itself.  And as if the song selection and delivery weren't entertaining enough, they added a ton of visually stimulating wardrobes and set designs.  I am not a person that enjoys musicals very much, but this movie is so much more than a musical.  I could sit here and type on and on pointing out the many reasons why Moulin Rouge is fabulous movie, but I don't think I would do justice to the movie.  I never get tired if seeing this movie, its always just as entertaining as the first time I saw it.  Stubborn people like VincentV. will probably always give horrible reviews to movies where there's no over-the-top mayhem and/or nudity."

Never mind that the REAL star of the Moulin Rouge was an obese redhead (a far cry from Kidman) nicknamed \"The Glutton\", never mind that the film is chock full of ridiculous anachronism (who the hell sold these jerks the rights to \"Smells like Teen Spirit\", fer chrissakes??? they should be found and punished. Severely.), never mind that the entire film is directed to look exactly like an extended music video: Ewan MacGregor is SO DREAMY WHEN HE SINGS and that is all that matters! (Ugh, excuse me for just a second: I feel ill.) A lot of people defend this move because they think it's \"romantic\". Well, if your ideal of love and romance is this gaudy, this detached from reality, this superficial, you can keep it. I'll stick with the real thing. This film is strictly for fourteen year old girls. Even a guest appearance by the Green Fairy can't cover the stink of this turd."

The characters are written horribly, the story is absolute crap, and the movie seems to think it's profound, and no, we are not at least able to enjoy the spectacle, because the movie is shot in such a way that the sets and costumes escape our vision as fleeting as possible. Let's imagine an incredibly shallow movie as a hollow eggshell covered in glitter. Now let's imagine self-importance and pretentiousness as a giant hand around the eggshell, pushing harder the more it believes the movie is spectacular. Do the math."

The camerawork is all over the place, the singing isn't that good, the characters are very flat and have no depth whatsoever and the message about love is incredibly pretentious.My biggest grip is with the message. This movie is supposedly about love. But we never really learn what love really means according to this movie. Saying the word \"love\" a bunch of times does not count as talking about it. Love is arguably the most complex emotion. It's something that should be talked about in great lengths. But this movie never tells us what love is. The type of love that is stressed is the love you have with a significant other. That's not to say that that isn't a type of love worth talking about, but that's not the only type of love there is. What about love for a family member or love for your friends? Even this wouldn't be a problem but the love between the two leads is spontaneous and is not that interesting.The story itself is incredibly thin and worn out.None of the characters are interesting or complex.The camera can never sit still for five seconds.For me, nothing about this movie worked. But it still gets a 1 because the costumes were nice and I cannot stop listening to \"El Tango de Roxanne.\""

Nicole Kidman exhibits a range that is almost too astonishing for words: she succeeds in high melodrama, camp, subtlety, comedy, and her singing is just so beautiful. Personally, Jill S., I don't think she falls flat with her comic bits at all. She has perfect timing; the scene in the elephant dressing room in particular really showcases her gifts for comedy. The way she shifts her eyes, raises her eyebrows, and adds that hilariously seductive tone to her voice is pure comic genius. And she's gorgeous beyond belief."

(2001)Sinopsis:Christian, un joven poeta parisino que abandona el hogar para mudarse al barrio de Montmartre, cuna de la bohemia rom\u00e1ntica de finales del siglo pasado y de curiosos personajes y artistas como Toulouse-Lautrec. El sexo, la absenta y el Can Can son las \u00fanicas reglas que parecen existir en este barrio que se ha convertido en el centro de la noche parisina y por encima de todo, como gran punto de referencia, el Moulin Rouge, que vive su mayor momento de gloria gracias a Satine. Satine es la estrella del cabaret y la cortesana m\u00e1s deseada, que aspira a convertirse en actriz. Cuando Christian la conoce se enamora perdidamente de ella y la convierte en su musa.Opini\u00f3n:Para empezar, nunca vi esta pel\u00edcula en su momento ni en los a\u00f1os posteriores hasta apenas 15 minutos atr\u00e1s, no cre\u00ed que me fuera a gustar, pero la verdad es que acab\u00e9 viendo estrellitas de lo mucho que me encant\u00f3. No es para nada perfecta, tiene varias incoherencias a nivel narrativo, o sea, una pel\u00edcula que est\u00e1 basada en una \u00f3pera y en una novela, que a su vez est\u00e1 ambientada entre 1899 y 1900 que incorpore a su repertorio canciones de Nirvana y Madonna le restan mucha seriedad al gui\u00f3n, a nivel visual creo que es tal vez demasiado pomposa, lo cual no me molest\u00f3, pero puede que a varios les haga explotar los globos oculares, las actuaciones est\u00e1n a la altura, tenemos a una Nicole Kidman divertidisima y llena de sensualidad y por otro lado a un adorable y t\u00edmido Ewan McGregor, el cual es un verdadero encanto aqu\u00ed, ambos hacen una dupla excelente sin lugar a dudas.Pese a las inconsistencias mencionadas, es una pel\u00edcula musical lo suficientemente buena para cautivar a aquellos los que les guste el cine de este g\u00e9nero, entretiene como es debido a pesar de que para m\u00ed gusto es demasiado cursi, de no ser por el reparto, ni siquiera la hubiera visto, una versi\u00f3n encubierta y menos molesta de Romeo y Julieta.Valoraci\u00f3n:5 \u2b50 de 5 \u2b50"

When the feature portrays drama, it seems cheesy and corny and when it focuses on drawing laughs, it looks like they aren't serious about it. Baz Luhrman and Craig Pearce; the writers, have written an uneven paced script that may be good in bits and pieces but not as a whole concrete material. Baz Luhrman's execution skill develops as the film ages on screen for the first half of it seems redundant and unsupervised. The performance is the only key that helps one hold on to this feature as Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are convincingly good in it. Moulin Rouge! is brilliant on technical aspects like costume design, production design and choreography with a stellar performance but what lacks in here is a reason or a soul that makers fails to install in it."
