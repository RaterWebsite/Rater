It is quite inspiring that a regular person can become a real hero. Three Americans, main characters, play themselves in that movie. To my knowledge no director did it in a feature movie before Eastwood. But I could see why no one did it. You could tell these guys are not actors and that they were \"acting\" in the movie.Additionally, there was too much of nothing in the film, especially during the trio's vacation in Europe. Much attention was devoted to development of the main hero, which is fine. But it would be much better to make it a short film, not full feature."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "The 15:17 to Paris is one of those movies that I'm not quite sure why it was made. Is it a heroic story? Yes, but the actual story is an event that lasted maybe 10 minutes. So to make an entire film about it, and cast the actual people from the event in the movie... Let's just say my expectations were pretty low going in, and it didn't even meet them. The acting in this movie is quite painful to watch at times. I don't think this is entirely the fault of the actors considering how few takes Clint Eastwood has been known to take, but it really sticks out like a sore thumb at times. You can also tell that the actual people from the event had never acted before this movie, although they weren't as bad as I was expecting them to be. But, the acting isn't even the reason why this movie is a stinker. This movie is a stinker because 96% of it doesn't matter. None of the plot matters that much when you reach the end. It's as simple as that. It's all just fluff until you reach the final 20 minutes of the movie, and not good fluff at that. I wasn't gonna mention this originally, but there were also some fairly random religious references throughout this movie that felt quite out of place to me and the person I saw the movie with. Just felt shoehorned in."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "In the day-and-age where everyone is asking for something different, Clint Eastwood delivers on that and gives the audience something different. The 15:17 to Paris focuses more on the events leading up to the incident adverse to the incident itself. By using the people who experienced the event adverse to using actors, the movie allows these brave heroes to justly tell their story."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Such an atrocity of a film. Boring, stupid, pointless. Everything about it is terrible. The acting of terrible, the pacing is the worst I've ever seen, and it literally takes the WHOLE movie to reach the train scene. At this point I am convinced that Clint Eastwood has lost his mind."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Spoiler-freeThe 15:17 to Paris is definitely nowhere near as bad as the professional reviewers and some of the audience comments might lead you to believe. Were there moments of cringe-worthy dialogue? A few perhaps. Was it obvious that the three main actors weren't really actors? Yes, but, honestly, that was actually refreshing. Because we live in a very photoshopped and airbrushed and overly-rehearsed and overly-polished society media-wise. The media in almost all of its forms offers us the common man and woman these near impossible standards of beauty, grace, athleticism, eloquence, etc, and not to mention in films especially, absolutely over-the-top and outlandish unreal action sequences. So it was more than refreshing to see something that matches up more with real life and that shows some of the awkwardness and banality, and even mundaneness and mediocrity, of the average Joe and average Jane.Now, in my opinion, yes, the three Heroes / actors are a bit too wooden and solemn in their dialogue. I would assume that in real life they have more banter and more of a joking nature in at least some of their interactions.\u00a0 But in the movie, this either wasn't shown, or when the attempt was made to show some levity, it usually seemed to fall fairly flat.But again, I did not personally find that nearly as offensive and detracting from the overall quality of the movie as did the majority of the critics and some of the non-professional reviewers. In fact, again, I found it to be rather refreshing.For me, the movie worked, and worked very well. It's certainly not a masterpiece like Unforgiven or Gran Torino. And it certainly doesn't have the same dramatic punch throughout like Sully and United 93 had. In fact, I think it would have been interesting if they had made some mention of United 93 in the movie as a form of foreshadowing. These young men / heroes are all in their mid-twenties, so they would have been around 10 years old when 9/11 happened, and probably in there early to mid-teens wind the movie United 93 came out, so, in my opinion, that certainly could have made for something that might have inspired these boys.Overall, an excellent movie and well worth watching. And if you go, make sure you stay at least halfway through the end credits."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Using actual people was a good concept but would have been better in a made for tv version and about 1/2 the length.  This is not a hollywood quality movie.  Traveling around Europe felt stretched out and didn't add much to the overall story.  It was a good attempt but ultimately falls short."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "I have so much respect for these guys, and the story is very heroic, but honestly aside from the train scene (which only takes up like 10 minutes) this story just isn't interesting enough to make for even a 90 minute movie. It has the best of intentions which is why I hate to say this is just bad"}, {"rating": "3", "text": "I was extremely disappointed in this film.  Everybody has their 15 minutes of fame (and not to diminish the heroism of the actual heroes) but I struggled to find 15 minutes of enjoyment in this film.  It seemed like the film space had to be filled with a lot of \"stuff\" to make up the time.  I was thoroughly bored."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I didn\u2019t really want to see this movie until I found out the heroes played themselves, including Mark Moogalian. It made the recreation more real to me where there was less \u201cdramatic license\u201d than most movies based on true events. These guys won\u2019t be getting acting awards, but the story was told well (a little slow though until the incident) on why they were able to stop this gunman. It was a worthwhile experiment to use the real people!"}, {"rating": "3", "text": "How does a filmmaker depict an event that lasts only a few minutes, but reverberates with terrorist consequences? For director Clint Eastwood, he chose to go into deep the backstory of the 3 Americans who saved the day. For authenticity, he cast the actual trio as themselves, which is a cool concept, but resulted in somewhat wooden performances. To compound matters, the script is stunningly simplistic and the wanderings around Europe are crushingly dull. Considering what actually happened, the climactic event has little suspense or even a discernible timeline (there's also no conclusion of what happened with the terrorist or the man who was seriously wounded). It's admirable to salute the bravery of these young men, but this re-creation creaks with a one-dimensional approach that's exacerbated by mediocre acting."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Tragically bad mishandling of what was a compelling true story. There's a reason actors exist...they can act. Casting the three actual guys, and then apparently letting them ad-lib for two hours, was fatal miscalculation. Eastwood also f'd up Sully by creating a whole fake story line about the crew being second-guessed by the NTSB. Never happened, and the movie revolves around it."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Incredible story but no direction whatsoever and it wasted most of talking about their super boring backstory and nothing about the terrorist."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Honestly, Eastwood will be remembered as a great American filmmaker, but these American military fluffer propaganda movies he keeps making about how star spangled awesome people in the service are, makes me want to vomit. I was in the Army. Just as many jerks there as there are anywhere else in life."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "The critics got this completely wrong. The point of this film is to show that average people, with all their flaws, can achieve greatness if they have integrity and if given the opportunity. Eastwood conveys this theme with realism, style and grace by using the original characters. He also conveys how hard it is for the average person to discover their values and translate them into a career or job in today's world. This is the best movie I've seen in a long time.  I applaud its honesty and unpretentious realism."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was so slow, the dialogue & story line was like watching paint dry. I kept hoping it would get better but was very disappointed. I don't really understand how someone playing themselves could be so unbelievable. I understand the young men were heroes & feel they should have let actors portray them. The fanatical religious propaganda was ridiculous. I actually like some of the real actors in the movie unfortunately this movie was subpar. I really think this story could have been told better, with a deeper connection.  Clint Eastwood did not do a good job of directing or producing this film."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "I think Clint could have made this into a nice movie short-maybe 45 minutes. That's about the length of time it would take to cover relevant detail on Spencer Stone's background and add some detail for Anthony Sadler and Alek Skarlatos that was missing. At 96 minutes running time, it still needed significant editing. The middle portion of the movie, which showed the guys touring Europe before the fateful train trip, was especially tedious and included banal dialogue and little of interest. We didn't learn much about our heroes from that, so why include it?  And how did I emerge from that movie having watched four people subdue a terrorist and aid a badly injured man and still not feel a sense of tremendous pride and nationalism? Perhaps it was too unpretentious and too concerned with an accurate retelling complete with mundane detail?  I don't know.  What I do know is there was vastly more dramatic tension and emotion in the low budget Bollywood movie I saw yesterday, Pad Man, about a dude in India who devoted is life to developing a cheap menstrual pad to save the lives of many women there.  That's a movie worth seeing.  This was a mess and should be a source of embarrassment for Clint Eastwood."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "I would have to say that this is Clint Eastwood's worst film to date.  I was truly bored for 95 percent of the film and only at the end was there something to keep my interest.  I hope this isn't his last film, I love his other movies!"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I enjoyed this movie immensely, and I left the theater deeply moved.  Now, I certainly can understand why a movie critic would hate \u201c15:17 to Paris.\u201d  It makes normal Americans feel extremely proud.  The hero of the story is a big, strong military man, as is one of his two buddies.  The heroic trio, as boys, loved to play war games with guns.  And the worst parts: all three were raised in Christian homes, and the one who jumped and subdued the Muslim terrorist later asked the wounded man to whose artery he was applying direct pressure if he wanted to pray.  (He did normal Christian stuff, and he looked really admirable while he did it.)  The leg-crossing pencil-necks said the long buildup to the climactic showdown on the train was boring and it was a mistake to let the three heroes play themselves rather than hire professional actors.  I was not in the least bit bored by the depictions of events that had shaped the men's characters and of the activities that led up to the fateful day, and I came to like all three men very much.  They drink, swear, and go places I wouldn\u2019t go; but they are the embodiment of what sets Americans apart.  So remember that critics live in a bubble and break into a rash at the sight of perspiration, and go see this wonderful inspiring film.  I suspect that word-of-mouth will turn this film into a blockbuster."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Not sure what Clint was thinking. Something like this could have maybe been written for the stage where awkward acting is a little less noticeable. The movie is...not good. Terrible even.

I don't say this lightly, but it was probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. There just wasn't a story. It was literally all filler-- and not even good filler. It is 90%+ flat, lazy dialogue, plot points, and appeals to long worn out tropes. I'm not sure why Eastwood and co. decided to include the actual men as the actors, but it did not pay off.

This was an excellent movie. Moved me to tears as the main event unrolled. Inspired me to be the best man I can be, not knowing what I'll need to face in the future.

Christianity, terrorists, the military, the chaos of this world; all of this plays a very important part in this film. Of course, this is not the world that critics would want their audiences to think about since film is about creating an artificial escape that perfectly resembles liberal/atheist ideologies.
