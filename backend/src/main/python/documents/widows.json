While the action sequences are admittedly well orchestrated, they can't make up for a plethora of other shortcomings that derail this offering from being what it aspires to be. In the end, this is yet another example of a vastly overrated release from a vastly overrated director."

The camerawork is innovative, and the direction does a fantastic job of capturing the seedy underbelly of Chicago. Gillian Flynn's script is a good follow up to Gone Girl, and does enough differently to experiment and really tell a good story. Not all of the experiments work, and there are some out of place political jabs that slow the movie down. However, this is an engaging story about a group of women who aren't going to lie back and take what life is giving them. Definitely a recommend from me!"

Oh wait, a group of women leaded by a black character making an heist, WOW!! 10 out of 10 so innovative. Nowadays looks like critics are more worried about being politically correct and to not offend anybody instead of giving a proper raw critic (same happened with Black Panther, Moonlight...). Don't get me wrong this movie has potential but it lacks content, has a lot of plot holes and it's a poor attempt of Steve Mcqueen at doing a drama inside a thriller with a society critic in between, and you're left with none. And look the movie it's actually ok, but being acclaimed as if it were something more than it is, it's just hypocrisy. On the other hand amazing performance by Viola Davis."

One suspects that she should have made this remark to director Steve McQueen a lot earlier. The subsequent 20 minutes do nothing to redress the balance and the film ends up a long and pretentious dud demonstrating no 'GO' whatsoever.The cast do their best with Davis demonstrating one pained expression after another and Elizabeth Debicki providing eye catching support. However, it is Robert Duvall who really brings his few scenes to life as the retiring politician disenchanted with the political path being taken by his son (Colin Farrell). McQueen seems to be better at handling more complex/important issues in films like '12 Years a Slave' and 'Shame'. His direction here is as slow as a tethered tortoise lacking any urgency or pace that the genre requires. The routine screenplay doesn't help and the movie ends up feeling messily truncated in many scenes, although at nearly 2 and a quarter hours tighter editing would have been a welcome relief.The final heist is an almost insignificant let down and the film on the whole is a major disappointment. Also what is it about Daniel Kaluuya that has critics reaching for superlatives? His appeal definitely eludes me! The best thing about this misconceived enterprise is the end titles song by Sade called 'The Big Unknown'. On this evidence the film deserves to remain just that!"

Where it falls just slightly short is in the pacing - about half way through, I thought this was going to be a set-up for a 10-hour TV season. But as a film, it needed to kick in to gear more quickly. It establishes for about 60% and then truly gets moving in the last 20%. But I would certainly recommend this to anyone.  It absolutely deserves its Must-See status."

Rather than sit back and take it Veronica (Viola Davis), Alice (Elizabeth Debicki), Linda (Michelle Rodriguez) and Belle (Cynthia Erivo) take matters into their own hands.Story by Gillian Flynn and directed by Steve McQueen. A thriller with brilliant performances that will have you on the edge of your seat. An original and slightly different take on a heist film. And lets face it the heist genre has been done again and again so it\u2019s refreshing to see one that isn\u2019t just a rehash of Oceans 11. The chemistry between the women is what made this for me, along with the character development. Throw in a slimy politician in the form of Colin Farrell and the generic movie psychopath in the form of Daniel Kaluuya and you\u2019ve got yourself a must see crime thriller. It reels you in with it\u2019s sharp script and realistic characters you don\u2019t sit there questioning the logistics of the plan or the heist you\u2019re fully invested. My only criticism is Liam Neeson, he\u2019s completely miscast and clearly just put in the film to get more people to see it. You\u2019re not going to see this for Liam Neeson, everyone else fit into their parts yet he just stood out the whole time for me. Don\u2019t let that put you off, Widows is worth your time. Dark, gritty and highly recommended."

Nah, neither do I.\u2018Widows\u2019 is an outstanding crime drama from director Steve McQueen. A female driven movie that doesn't glorify itself as such. It's smart and compelling - emotional roller coaster through out. The themes of corruption, politicians, sexism, race relations, privileges, and greed that mirrors society we know. I was hooked from start till finish.Steve McQueen took something that could\u2019ve been a generic mainstream heist movie, but made it so refreshing. Just like \u2018First Man\u2019, it\u2019s a complete departure from his other work, but isn\u2019t too different where you can\u2019t believe he directed it. Plenty of long shots, especially how he directed a freestyle rap with the camera spinning around a group of characters. I thought that scene was brilliantly done. There\u2019s a scene where Colin Farrell drives to his house after a election promotion, but McQueen mounts the camera on the hood of the car and we only hear Farrell\u2019s conversation while nothing is visible - which is all done in one shot. Rather than cutting back or forward, but McQueen isn\u2019t flat. His directing is bold and makes every shot engaging.How about the cast? It\u2019s something to die for. Everyone manages to get their time to shine. Viola Davis is excellent as usual and the main center of a crowded cast. I love the little details with her character: Like how she always carries around a white fluffy dog almost like a child. She can express grief and the weight on her shoulders and play it effortlessly. Honestly, she\u2019s one of the greatest actress of this generation.Elizabeth Debicki, Michelle Rodriguez, and Cynthia Erivo command the screen whenever they are on. Just like Davis, these wife\u2019s have nothing in common, which serves as development in character with different backgrounds. Great to see Rodriguez finally showing dramatic range.But Daniel Kaluuya scared the sh*t out of me. The intensity in his presence and brutal killings makes him a true threat. Every Time he appears on screen, you know something horrible is going to happen. Colin Farrell and Robert Duvall are so great together, which surprised me to learn that both of they scenes, according to McQueen was completely improvised. Even Liam Neeson, despite the small screen time, but he\u2019s really good and I wish he did more dramatic work than any other \u2018Taken\u2019 movie.The other cast members are also great, but we\u2019ll be here for days when naming them off. I could go on forever.Han Zimmer\u2019s score is nothing short of haunting. Gloomy with a heavy theme of loneliness. However, it picks up pace when the heist shifts in gear and everything from there is tension after tension. The beats gets higher and eventually becomes untamed.For issues: There\u2019s not a lot for complains. Although if I have to pick. Since there\u2019s so much going on, it can sometimes interrupt the flow. Other than that, that\u2019s really it.Overall rating: I really struggled to catch a breath."

      "text": "This was a solid film that had a little bit of everything to offer! A daring heist, criminals and gangsters, corrupt politicians, but most of all: four bold women willing to risk everything, all in the name of justice for themselves and their late husbands who were killed in a heist gone wrong. The film boasts and A-list all-star cast, and every one of them give such great performances that I can't really single anybody out for praise. However, I will say that it was really nice to see the four main women this film centered on given a great opportunity to shine in such a bold and gritty narrative that's almost always reserved for men. Themes of empowerment towards them definitely run heavy throughout the film, but the material and story they're given to work with definitely lives up to its potential and blends very well with said themes. The biggest issue with ensemble films however is that sometimes when there's so many characters and story arcs, it's hard to give equal balance to all of them and they aren't quite fully resolved or given the full closure that they deserve. Such is the case with the final act of this film, which felt a little rushed in many regards, but the rest of the film was definitely compelling with a solid story to tell and a very talented cast to help tell it!"

Although it screams out of the gate with a furious car chase, the film settles into a robust character drama (with some social commentary for extra punch). The group of women has to deal with their own lives, while trying to manage an elaborate heist. Still, this film is more about the people than the crime. All of the exceptional actors create interesting characters. Director Steve McQueen has included a few technically flashy shots and some surprising twists, but he's imbued every frame with a quiet intensity that keeps it compelling. Although one might be tempted to compare it to \"Oceans 8,\" this is much less glossy and much more thoughtful."

Even in the more \"thought-provoking\" parts of the movie, where the end is being set up, I found that the characters and direction kept me entertained. There are some scenes that only contribute to a sub-plot of the movie, and they are occasionally better than the main plot. This one scene in the car was particularly interesting. I think the main things that grounds this movie are the performances and characters. The plot isn't particularly engaging or action-packed, and the pacing could use some work, but the performances kept me engaged and entertained and I think that kept me feeling it was worth the watch."

Every time he's on screen, you sense something is going down, the way he taunts the people he's going to kill or hurt, is terrifying... just brilliant.The politics in this movie, at times, felt distracting of the real deal going on, but it was quite necessary.

It\u2019s hard to imagine anything less from the likes of Steve McQueen (of 12 Years a Slave) and screenwriter Gillian Flynn (of Sharp Objects and Gone Girl, one of my favorite crime thrillers of all time, funny and pulpy and completely mind-bending), but this movie found its place in the gaps between other heist films. It tells its story through the exquisite beauty of adaptation and underestimation, the negation of action hero archetypes, and (as Slate reviewer Dana Stevens notes) thoughtful commentary about tribal politics and gun laws.Some of the most striking shots are simple ideas like the long, single take shot of the young politician played by Colin Farrell and his aide blowing off steam after a small event, a camera afixed to the hood of the car captures the stark contrast between the neighborhood  where he\u2019s campaigning and the one where his campaign quarters are, all the while his monologue about the transactional, futile nature of local politics accentuates the visuals. Farrell\u2019s perennial visits to his political rival\u2019s HQ in a cramped church building punctuate story with beautiful conversational set pieces, like the choral odes of a Greek tragedy.The actual heist is a bit of an anticlimax, as seems the case with all of the great films of the year (the Sisters Brothers and You Were Never Really Here both employ anticlimax effectively). It\u2019s nice to see the way in which nearly all of the legwork is accomplished by the loan, tall, waifish white woman who makes more money than anyone else going on lavish dinner dates with men she meets online. There\u2019s quite a bit of self-awareness in this script that the racial politics of this film use for comic effect.David Kaluuya is an excellent villain: the scene in the gym is stunning in its construction and trajectory; his scene work while staking the women; listening to pointed but subtly presented news clips and learning Spanish on tape; the bowling alley. The Twists this movie has in store are pretty  impressive. There\u2019s something here for everyone, especially dog-lovers. That white dog better be nominated for an Oscar."

Widows has some good moments such as Daniel Kaluuya's character shooting two guys rapping and attacking a cripple in a bowling alley with a knife which sadly is classed as hilarious by somebody on YouTube as they posted that scene and found it amusing. It's not amusing or funny but it's a damn good scene but besides those two scenes the rest is pretty much fairly dull and mostly boring and it's a film that drags and drags for long periods and feels too long. Daniel Kaluuya's character was excellent and his acting was the best in the whole film in my opinion and some characters in the film felt weaker than watered down vodka and some of the acting was pretty bad. Fell asleep watching this film on all three occasions I watched it which says it all because Heat is a long film that drags but it has a decent story and suspense and develops the characters pretty good unlike Widows that drags and you lose interest and has very little if any redeeming features."

Though I haven't seen any of the \"Fast and Furious\" films in which she has starred I have always felt some empathy for Michelle Rodriguez and her many run-ins with the law. I have heard a lot, both pro and con, about Cynthia Erivo regarding her star-making role on stage in the musicalized version \"The Color Purple\" but this is the first time I have seen her. Talking about the first time, I don't ever recall seeing Elizabeth Debick before but once you do you won't forget her and it would be a spoiler if I said anything more about that introduction!The \"Widows\" is about women taking charge in basically what would be a men's genre, a heist film. Director Steve McQueen, mainly known for \"12 Years A Slave\", directs, and co-wrote the script with Gillian Flynn, author of \"Gone Girl\", keeping the pace quick with some outstanding camera work. There are many twists and turns and at points, just a bit too much regarding sex, race, politics and social issues along with too much unnecessary violence but the film is easy to follow except near the end, which I'll get back to in a minute.  No matter where the film goes the women always hold your interest which makes this a better than average heist film.I do have a couple of questions about the ending but discussing them here would give away some major points and give away some of the surprises so after you have seen the film let's talk!The film could have been tightened up a bit regarding its over 2 hour playing time just by cutting out Robert Duvall's storyline, not that he isn't good but it really doesn't add anything to the film, the storyline or the heist but does add to the Chicago politics of the time.Be prepared for some laughs, certainly a jump out of your seat once or twice and definitely a jolt at some of the violence but \"Widows\" entertains plus allows the audience to watch some fine acting by the actresses. I am not ignoring the men but it is hard talking about their roles without giving spoilers except to say, maybe, that Liam  Neeson is Davis's husband or that Colin Farrell is Duvall's son, etc.Just watching Viola Davis's face is worth the admission alone!"

This film is neither and was quite cliche and boring for much of the 2nd half.  I am shocked by some of the critic reviews, probably because the director has a previous Oscar win. But his previous films he has said each had a personal meaning, and it seems clear, this one had no meaning.  There is no concise point, and no reason for the film to even exist.  I learned nothing new, was not moved, was not excited much, did not laugh, as the script is very droll, very boring, and much of the characters actions are cliche, the type of thing you can see in any mediocre action or TV show anytime.  The only interesting parts were the first 5 minutes, the last 15 minutes, and a few rare snippets of side characters such as Colin Farrell's.  If the whole film was about Collin Farrell's character, it might have made for an interesting drama.  Instead it is pretty much a cliched heist attempt at a movie, but told through a female perspective, which then adds nothing new to the genre, is less exciting, and with the poor dialogue and directing..it is  not worth wasting time watching unless you enjoy mediocre and cliche average action and TV shows.  From Steve McQueen and the level of actors and here, and the \"positive\" reviews, I expected much, much, more, and was disappointed by the end, and quite frankly bored for much of the last hour. Unfortunately, I would have to officially call this a bomb..."

      "text": "I will tell you what we have here. A good, crime drama, thats what we have. This is movie about real woman who are about discover how to survive in the man dominated world. Against all odds female cast is forced to work together to ensure continuity of their existence. When man dies and our female heroines want to maintain good standard of living instead of going to work, quick cashing in sounds like better alternative for them, right? So we have fantastic acting here. There are lots of stars in this movie, everyone played really well. Among all of the great stars who played in the movie we have brilliant Viola Davis playing Veronica - a brain behind whole operation. Against all odds she unites with Alice ,played by Elizabeth Debicki, Linda, our lovely and all fans favourite Michelle Rodriguez, and Belle, super athletic Cyntia Erivo. All of them lost their husbands in the heist that went wrong and Victoria who inherited her late husband (Liam Neesons) next heist's plans is forced to carry on heist in order to save herself from just a little bit crazy in the head Jatemme played by Daniele Kaluuya. Lets not forget about Collin Farrell and Brian Tyree Henry who are in the movie to remind us that when it comes to money and power, greed and sick ambition do not distinguish between where you come from, when the game's stakes are high you will be dirty just like anyone else. Movie is tense, well directed and I encourage everyone to watch it. Most of the actors are well characterized in their roles and offer genuine, well rounded perspective on how is to try to survive in mighty Chicago. The plot can get little predictable but it does not matter much as movie is masterfully done. I give it 8/10 and encourage you to watch it."

      "text": "Why do critics rave about Widows while many ordinary viewers don\u2019t? Critics love innovation, complexity, unusual camera shots and plot twists which Widows provides in quantity. More casual viewers want to have a sense of what going on as they watch the movie.  Yet the plot of Widows is simple: a gang led by Harry Rawlins ( Liam Neeson) in the opening scene get killed in an attempted heist, highlighted by exploding automobiles careening towards the police. Rawlins wife (Viola Davis) discovers that money taken in the heist is to repay crime boss Jamal Manning (Brian Tryee Henry) who visits her and demands that the 2 million be repaid within the month; which leads the widows, led by Davis, to decide to carry out a heist based on plans left behind by Rawlins. Normal result is heist is carried out, crime boss repaid or killed, and life, maybe, returns to normal.  Not here.  Twists, double-crosses, and devious machinations are introduced with the notable cast garlanding their conversations with multiple F-words and their variations.  Since the scene is Chicago, politics is involved from very rich and cranky Robert Duvall playing an aging pol still calling shots, his son Jack Mulligan (Colin Farrell) running for alderman against black crime boss Manning. For ordinary viewers, this is one movie where one might want to read in advance the outlines of the plot before viewing the film.  Overall, there\u2019s fine acting, unusual camera shots, and occasional action to satisfy most\u2014though there are long stretches of the movie which seem to be grinding gears rather than moving ahead."

      "text": "This is a good movie if you're willing to call it as it is -- a fun, superficial, outlandishly silly heist thriller. The plot feels so contrived, you almost have to have a suspension of disbelief in order to get through the film and take it entirely seriously. I also think they could have cast better for the role of Jamal Manning. The whole thing was just poorly thought out, at the end of the day. What's the the random plotline with Rawlings and Manning? And the charismatic reverend gets a huge introduction and then is never seen again. Then the robbery gets botched, yet somehow there's a car available to them to chase down Jatemme Manning. And they drop her off at the hospital under a fake alias, both dressed in black, with Manning Sr's wife as a witness of how they were dressed and the height and frame of Alice....yet neither of those two women get in trouble. Just preposterous, really."

      "text": "To call this a thrilling heist film would be accurate, yet miss the mark. There is so much more going on than the very entertaining surface. McQueen has a keen eye for brilliant composition and the cast is excellent across the board. Just to pick one small example, there is a \"throw away\" scene shot into the luxury SUV driving Colin Farrell home from a speech in a poor neighborhood. As we learn a little about his cynicism (and the public and private face), the homes outside quickly shift to upper class in a matter of blocks. There is much depth to the story beyond the entertaining genre. McQueen and his cast elevate the film to so much more then a successful heist story. Highly recommended."

It's a very well made film. The cast is phenomenal and McQueen knows how to get the most out of them but I couldn't feel as amazed as I did with all his previous films and that's a shame and big issue.Don't get me wrong Widows is very good film and a very good option to watch any day. Its quality is untouchable and undeniable but it's not the film I expected."

      "text": "McQueen's fourth installment of this amalgamation of pathos dark crime drama is the least McQueen-y up till now.WidowsMcQueen's incongruent tale is perpetually stable in its tone. And it's that stability that helps McQueen stay on the track, no matter how much the narration fluctuates, from escaping gun shots to struggling through a trauma, his language speaks fluently to the audience. The script pretty much revolves around a heist-gone-wrong but it is a character driven feature with characters in aplenty. And often whilst fiddling with these many characters, the grip starts to lose in the narration but this is where McQueen swoops in and saves the day. The messy relationships, hidden past, cutthroat politics, morality conflict is the real ruggedness that keeps it grounded and essentially crispy.On driver's seat, Davis has a tricky part to play. Her, resisting through the trauma and going on an entirely new track is equally competent and sincerely portrayed. Neeson as his supporter gets a lot on his plate than one would imagine and he has held on to it decently. The frustrated character of Farrell whose career is plummeting down and often at the borderline risk of being disclosed of his true self, bodes well with the storyline even though is stereotypical. His conversations with Duvall; who still can overpower anyone on the screen, are one of the finest bits of the film. Debicki, the \"weak\" link of the group, gets almost as wide range as Davis's complex character.She gets to be the reason of the \"pity\" and also an inspiring phoenix natured symbol. Rodriguez's character is often game, and isn't put under any surveillance of crisis, her role is pretty much a bullet shot out from the gun and she delivers up to that. Kaluuya has a gritty role to fill in the shoes he does deliver the chills as far as he is on screen. In fact, his character is the one whose threat ticks behind the screen throughout the course of the feature. Since the lead cast is suffering for the screen time itself, the supporting ones like Bernthal and Coon gets lost into bits and pieces.McQueen's adaptation with his co-writer Flynn is pretty much to make it as cinematic as possible and even though in its second act the script gets slow and non-provocative, the lift up or the elevation is then left to the performers. McQueen's fourth installment of this amalgamation of pathos dark crime drama is the least McQueen-y up till now. He has certainly evolved as a director and kept pushing himself on newer territories to explore. His lens and vision is what rejuvenates this almost a news channel to a compelling drama.The conversations are written explicitly and with a poker face, the writers never explain the structure and aren't clearly ready compromise. Despite of having few cards hidden under the sleeve, the awe struck moments doesn't go as anticipated. This is McQueen's project where even though he offers everyone an equal chance to steal the show, he soars above all. Widows is an art that pulsates for a hearty non-biased sensitive message that is fabricated with blazing gunpowder and unapologetic deceit."
