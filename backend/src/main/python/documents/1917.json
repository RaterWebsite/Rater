Fans of The Revenant and Apocalypse Now should see this immediately."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "At the end of \u201c1917,\u201d Writer/Director Sam Mendes (\u201cAmerican Beauty,\u201d the James Bond installments \u201cSkyfall\u201d and \u201cSpectre\u201d) dedicates the film to his grandfather, \u201cwho told us the stories.\u201d  For a film so presumably personal, \u201c1917\u201d is surprisingly lacking in both passion and perspective.Rather than offering any sort of commentary about WW I or the conditions surrounding it, Mendes settles for a formulaic thriller.  Lance Corporal Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) is summoned by his commanding general.  The allies have just received intelligence that their forces will be heading into a trap if they mount an offensive against the Germans the following morning.  Blake and Lance Corporal Schofield (George MacKay) must go through enemy lines to deliver the message to the field commander, located nine miles away, to cancel the attack.  If they fail, 1,600 men, including Corporal Blake\u2019s brother, will be slaughtered.  The film follows the two corporals\u2019 peril-filled trek to hand-deliver the order and save the troops.Technically, this film is impeccable.  Long shots have been a Hollywood staple for years.  They\u2019re usually used to establish an environment.  In this case, long shots are used consistently to follow the action, offering a vast visual scope that is sometimes breathtaking.  The filming in \u201c1917\u201d is further complicated because Mendes often chooses to track the actors with a single camera that follows the action for several minutes and several hundred yards of movement without any apparent editing.  Given these challenges, \u201c1917\u201d is in many ways Cinematographer Roger Deakins\u2019 movie.  Deakins has 80 credits as a cinematographer, dating back to 1975.  His diverse body of work ranges from \u201cBlade Runner 2049\u201d to \u201cSkyfall\u201d to \u201cFargo\u201d to \u201cThe Big Lebowski.\u201d  For \u201c1917,\u201d he is favored to win a second Oscar.  His use of light and shadow in this film\u2019s night scene is nothing less than a master class.The acting is also first-rate.  As Schofield, George MacKay\u2019s haunted expressions, stilted gait and thousand-yard stare communicate clearly the costs of war, with no need for exposition to underline the point.  Familiar faces Colin Firth and Benedict Cumberbatch lend their gravitas at key points.But ultimately, Mendes has made a war movie with a surprising air of detachment.  We learn little about the characters along the way, other than their single-minded determination to accomplish their goal.  We come to understand that this \u201cwar to end all wars\u201d was intensely personal, with enemies often shot up close, stabbed or even strangled with bare hands.  But commentary about this fact, or any larger points about war or human nature, is absent.  As a result, \u201c1917\u201d is a war film that\u2019s surprisingly bloodless."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Please not another WW2 drama! But while watching this movie I was glued to my seat.

The two leads McKay and Chapman each have their breakout role here as two soldiers we follow and identify with throughout their journey, and the cameos of veterans such as Colin Firth and Benedict Cumberbatch elevate the talent of acting in '1917'. Mendes and Deakins are one of the better creative teams in our modern filmmaking. To breathe new life into a dulled genre like war movies takes a true marvel but '1917' is just the film.

The fine lead performances of George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman, combined by the stunning photography of Roger Deakins, the riveting score of Thomas Newman and the expert direction of Sam Mendes, combine to make this truly one of the year's best.

In a general sense, 1917 is somewhat reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan in that it gives its characters a clear goal with an easily discernible outcome. The film employs a technique that creates the illusion that everything is happening in real time with long takes. While this technique has been used in films with both small (A Boy. A Girl. A Dream) and larger budgets (Birdman), often with mixed results, it is very effective in this film. Even without cuts in the middle of each scene, the camera and action work so well together that the audience is always seeing what they need to see. That along with a very sophisticated use of CGI, makes you feel like you are right in the middle of the action. The result is an emotionally satisfying film with strong performances that doesn't let its use of technology get in the way of telling a good story. At just under two hours 1917 is the perfect length. You won't be bored and perhaps you will have a greater appreciation for the sacrifices made by soldiers in battle.

This is an incredible piece of cinema!!!This movie is really a ride with sort of a dreamlike feel to it as the characters are taken from one unpredictable situation to another unable to know if they'll encounter friend or foe.Director Sam Mendes already showed in Skyfall that he commands an excellent visual style but this is a whole other level. The movie is filmed to give the illusion of one full tracking shot. Every moment the camera looks like it's following the characters. It is quite an achievement. Besides the tracking, the film also does a great job of deciding what elements of the scene to focus on.The scenery in this is a thing of ethereal beauty. The characters travel through a constantly shifting landscape, from trenches to abandoned farms and so forth. Even the worse of environments look good. In my opinion, the war torn town at night scene is one of the best images in film history.The one aspect that didn't always quite work for me was the music. Don't get me wrong. it's not bad. The issue is that the tracking shot gives a very natural, engrossing feel to what's going on. Suddenly, the music will boom loudly and take you out it.Overall, I highly recommend this.

If you're looking for a gritty realistic WW1 film, this isn't it.And it's a bloody shame, because the director obviously was aware of how to create great war cinematography. The large scale assaults are great to look at.

The dialogue was very well crafted, and there was only maybe one line that I thought was to on the nose.

The continuous shot concept is inventive and at times spectacular. Insanely detailed sets on a huge scale. MacKay and Chapman's performances are excellent. Sam Mendes and Roger Deakins create an intensely suspenseful and shockingly realistic version of World War I. However, it lags in a few crucial areas. Namely overall tone: It drums up a lot of suspense but then it also has a lot of repetitive and boring walking scenes. Production: The continuous shot concept kind of falls apart when it's not a huge action sequence. Especially when there's a lot of conversations happening at once. It's missing natural transitions and breaks in conversations. I get that it's based on a true story but aside from the soon to be famous climax this was a sort of interesting take on a largely uneventful story."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "The simplest storyline against the backdrop of great war it's more an exercise in high concept moving camera bravura filmmaking than a moving great war movie.

While very impressive it doesn't make for the most impactful experience which cutting across time and space affords.  (There is one obvious cut and several transitions that certainly were used to disguise cuts, besides ability of VFX to now eliminate such.)

I liked the Rudyard Kipling quote \"He travels fastest who travels alone.\"  A much much better recent WW1 thing was They Shall Not Grow Old, it was amazing by Peter Jackson."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Wow Great editing.. the feel of one (take) continues filming was different and nice"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I saw it in an IMAX theater so it was great photography.  However, I saw flaws such: 1) Who milked the cow  - milk was in the pail but where did it come from?  2) All the building/houses were bombed out- didn't just one remain intact  3) When his friend died, the field took the military ID and later gave it to the brother  - but one purpose of the ID is to identify the dead  - ID is put into the mouth in order to identify him later on.  Not Oscar best picture material - only won the Foreign Press Golden Globe Best Picture due to British relevancy."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "1917 has a constant nervous tension that will grip your attention and refuse to let go. I think it must be mentioned among the best World War I films from now on. Aesthetically, the cinematography will remind people of Dunkirk, plus they blended long clips together to make it look continuous. In my opinion, that core concept does not cause pacing issues. The story keeps up at a decent pace and rarely lingers too long. With one main goal in mind, the plot is powerful and easy to follow."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "So WW1 biggest war of history....no action... in the biggest war of history No politics as every army had mutinies in WW1. People were slaughtered by millions for kings and generals. The WW1 ended with russian and german revolution.  This movie has nothing of WW1. Lost 2 hours of my life.They should have used this movie for indiana jones instead of aliens. THis is isn't a war movie ... or a movie . It's a spam"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "The movie was flawless, the one camera technique was EPICNESS, and by the way score of the year too"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This was truly an amazing movie, and I loved the one shot camera technique too, And by the way George McKay was amazing in the film"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Visually stunning, moving, frightening, heartbreaking, exciting and breathtaking. Go see for yourself, I did. You will not be disappointed."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "During World War I, two young British soldiers are assigned to cross enemy lines and deliver a message that will keep 1600 of their troops from being ambushed. While the mission seems virtually impossible, it's rendered even more incredible by director Sam Mendes' decision to shoot the film as if it were one continuous shot. Not only does this lend an urgency to the journey, but it boggles the mind to consider how some of the scenes were even staged/captured. The trek itself is full of setbacks that make the mission even more challenging for the soldiers and the viewer (if not a bit strained on credibility). Even though there is a continuous level of stress, the drama never has the poignant power that the story demands. As a result, this is a masterful piece of filmmaking that's impact is more technical than emotional."}], "recommendations": ["das_boot", "dunkirk", "full_metal_jacket", "master_and_commander_the_far_side_of_the_world", "apocalypse_now", "the_deer_hunter", "anthropoid", "deepwater_horizon", "close_encounters_of_the_third_kind", "first_man", "empire_of_the_sun", "hacksaw_ridge", "greyhound", "the_thin_red_line", "13_hours_the_secret_soldiers_of_benghazi", "in_the_heart_of_the_sea", "you_were_never_really_here", "allied", "cold_mountain", "the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers", "the_master", "apollo_13", "the_great_escape", "the_monuments_men", "blade_runner_2049"]}
