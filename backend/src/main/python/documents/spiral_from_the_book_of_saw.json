      "text": "The political point of the film worked just fine, but I still left feeling disappointed. I got a feeling of contempt from the writers for Saw fans while watching this film. The Jigsaw 'copy-cat' has no interest in subjecting his victims to games - he is woefully uninteresting, merely another madman seeking revenge. I think this film was originally supposed to be its own thing until Lionsgate picked it up and retroactively pulled it into the Saw universe. At no point does this film feel at all indicative of a previous Saw film. There are no real choices to be made by the people in these traps. The killer simply wants to execute people, which is just not interesting at all. In fact, this kind of character has already been vilified and punished by Jigsaw in the past (e.g. Amanda, Hoffman). What hurts the most is that the sheer discrepancy between the copy-cat killer and Jigsaw himself is never really address by the film. This movie has absolutely no sense of what the core appeal of Saw is: Jigsaw's messed up ideology. The screenwriters think all the audience want is blood and gore with no regard for how or why the blood and gore is happening. No doubt, many people will buy tickets for just that reason, but that's not where the franchise's 1 billion dollar net profit comes from. This franchise would be nothing without its fans and ignoring what makes these films appealing to fans is such a disservice. At this point in the film one of two things should have happened:1) Have either a new character with actual screen presence and charisma or a returning apprentice finish the film and trump the copy-cat's twist by subjecting him to a real game with a real choice, ending with his death and a real Jigsaw killer on the loose again.2) Just straight up delete Saws 3-8 from the canon and start again with Tobin Bell, the only reason any Saw fan goes to see these films.Can you think of a better ending? Making a political point about trigger happy cops is fine but this just feels awkwardly shoehorned into the Saw franchise. Apparently this film is considered to be a spin off with little to do with the OG films anyway. Spiral is not Saw IX, so I guess I just won't watch Spiral 2."

The only things really going for it is that Rock is a capable lead and it was directed like an actual movie and not a soap opera. The rest of the film was just a nightmare. The traps weren't scary, The story is bland/predictable, You can see the twist coming from a mile away, and the cast is incredibly forgettable. It's a tolerable movie that is certainly above the worst films of the franchise but that isn't saying much. It is still deeply flawed and nowhere near as good as it could have been."

      "text": "Detective Zeke Banks (Chris Rock); is a man under stress. His decision to report a corrupt cop has made him enemies within his precinct and set him at odds with his father Marcus (Samuel L. Jackson); who also happens to be the former Chief of Police.This tension has caused Zeke to be shot in the line of duty when fellow officers refused to respond to his calls for backup which even further inflamed a tense situation and made Zeke a Lone Wolf who is hesitant to work with others and has cost him his marriage.Unfortunately for Zeke; a grisly murder happens and he is assigned a new partner named William Schenk (Max Minghella); to investigate what appears to be a copycat of the long-dead Jigsaw.The fact that the victim is a fellow cop inflames the office and when Zeke is sent a package from the killer which promises more killings to follow as the corruption within his department needs to be stopped.As the victims begin to mount; Zeke and William find themselves in a race against time to discover the identity of the killer and stop the killings.\u201cSpiral: From The Book Of SAW\u201d; is an interesting new entry into the franchise and in keeping with \u201cJigsaw:\u2019 was more engaging than several of the last films in the main franchise as it gives audiences deeper characters and scenarios than normally shown in the series.While the traps are as clever and gruesome as fans of the series would expect; the decision to target cops is an interesting choice and in many ways reflects the growing cries for reforming the Police but does it in an extreme way and balances out that there are good cops in the mix who serve and protect.Chris Rock also served as a Producer was good in the role and it was refreshing to see him play a darker and more dramatic character. While he still has moments of clever riffs; they are appropriately placed within the film and do not take away from the fact that Zeke is a troubled and driven individual.The supporting cast is solid and while I was able to identify the individual behind the killings fairly early; there were enough Red Herrings along the way that may keep audiences guessing.Director Darren Lynn Bousman who directed the second to the fourth film in the series has made a solid return to the franchise and keeps the dark and dirty look of the film\u2019s trap sequences and while they are gory; there is a cleverness to them that should delight fans of the series.In the end \u201cSpiral\u201d has enough of what fans of the franchise expect and infuses some interesting new characters and scenarios to make one of the more complete and enjoyable entries in the series.3.5 stars out of 5Skewed and Reviewed"

The concept of Spiral was great, new, and kept me thinking for a long while after the fact. It had a fresh feeling that kept me connected to the characters I was watching. For the first time in a long time, the gore in this Saw film wasn't the plot of the movie. It was used as a part of the plot while the main plot felt like something the Saw movies back then could have learned a thing or two from."

      "text": "As much fun as 2017's Jigsaw was, it being one of the better entries in the series overall, there were some clear signs that these movies were in need of a shakeup moving forward. Keeping John Kramer's story going for so long after his death like that was just getting convoluted and more than a little ridiculous, while also making it nearly impossible for newcomers to jump in. That's part of what got me so excited for Spiral. A big portion of the pre-release marketing was centered around how this was meant to take the franchise in a new direction, while still remaining true to its roots. Something I think it succeeds at marvelously.This is no reboot. Rather, it's the next chapter in the Saw universe. By going the copycat killer route the film is able to acknowledge and be connected to the original storyline in order to ensure there's a sense of continuity for longtime fans, while cleverly giving itself the freedom to do its own standalone thing and put some unique spins on familiar elements in the process to potentially bring in some new ones.Things play out much more like a crime-thriller this time out as we watch an honest cop try to uncover who is killing the corrupt police officers in his precinct (a plot device that feels very topical these days). The pace may be a bit slower than that of its predecessors in the first half, but the mystery is compelling and Chris Rock's surprisingly effective attempt playing against type makes even the most plodding moments at least moderately engaging. I was a bit worried about the comedian's acting ability going into this, and while some aspects of his performance are suspect I feel feel he did a fine job with his sarcastic wit going a long way towards making the protagonist likable for more than just his sympathetic backstory.The signature traps are smaller-scaled than any of the ones we've seen from Saw II and up, but they are memorable in their simplicity. The deaths themselves are also noticeably less gory. The thrills and chills you would expect are still in place. The horror is just handled in a way that allows more of the tension to come from the actual nature of the situation, as opposed to only the sight of blood and metal. All of which cause Spiral to hearken back to the very first title that started it all, which you can catch it giving more than a few affectionate nods to.To help pay for some of the bigger names in the cast, including a criminally underutilized Samuel L. Jackson, the visuals have taken something of a hit. These films have always been rather low-budget, but this is easily the cheapest looking of the bunch. The effects for the guts and mutilation are fine, but things like the dollar store quality fake facial hair really stick out like a sore thumb. I get part of the reason Lions Gate has no problem keeping this property going is because it costs them little to make and has always brought in massive returns, but if they're going to start hiring more recognizable talent like this maybe they should put some more money into them as well. Can you imagine Saw with the financial backing of a modern day blockbuster?Outside of that there's nothing I could really complain about as Spiral accomplishes everything it set out to do. It's just enough of a reinvention to be the fresh start the franchise needed, without betraying what made it so popular in the first place. I hope it gets some sequels because this got me excited to \"play a game\" again in a way a more direct continuation or full-on, slate-wiping reboot wouldn't have."

Me pareci\u00f3 una bocanada de aire fresco d\u00e1ndole otro tono mas enfocado a lo policiaco y al thriller, pero me parece una secuela digna sinceramente.Las trampas son tan dif\u00edciles y duras de superar que parecieran haber sido hechas por Amanda o Hoffman, pero dejando oportunidad de liberarse. Por otra parte, el nuevo antagonista, a mi parecer supo interpretar muy bien la filosof\u00eda y metodolog\u00eda de Jonh Kramer... Esos acertijos mentales y las brutales trampas lo demuestran.Finalmente, la escena final me parece hermosa, en el sentido que cuando la vi, me hizo sentir como cuando estaba viendo las primeras pel\u00edculas por primera vez. Lo mejor de las pel\u00edculas de Saw son las trampas y escenas finales, y la trampa del t\u00edtere me pareci\u00f3 genial... haci\u00e9ndome recordar a las trampas ejecutoras de las dem\u00e1s pel\u00edculas: El susto de Adam, la impotencia de Eric Matthews, la ira de Jeff, la sorpresa de Daniel Rigg, la desesperaci\u00f3n de Peter Strahm, la adrenalina de Hoffman, la satisfacci\u00f3n de Gordon y la resignaci\u00f3n de Brad Halloran... pude sentir todo eso con la escena final.Sinceramente, esta pel\u00edcula me ha encantado."

From new streaming tv shows like The Underground Railroad on Prime Video (check out our free trial link on the side below), Halston on Netflix, Those Who Wish Me Dead on HBO Max, and, of course, the theaters are opening back up across the country. And what better to come out this weekend but Spiral. This movie, lead by world class entertainer Chris Rock as Zeke, follows him as a maligned detective that is caught up trying to figure out a case that is eerily similar to the mass murderer Jigsaw. This updated Jigsaw copycat is focused on the police force and some possibly dirty cops. Let's see if Zeke has what it takes to get us off the couch, into the theaters and risking our lives and wallets.Ok, let's be honest about this flick. Chris Rock is an all time great comedian, so it should be expected that the comedic pieces of the film work. The problem is the comedic pieces throughout work better than everything else, and that's just not good enough for a horror thriller. Surprisingly, Rock was a remotely believable detective in this movie but it still so hard to separate him from himself. Same goes for Samuel L. Jackson. Sam actually played his part well but at one point I was thinking that I'd rather have Sam from Black Snake Moan in this flick. Bring that guy back because he fits the Saw extended-nightmare universe. After all, we really just came here for the brutality. Am I right? We came here to be disgusted and to have to check our backs for creepy little tricycle pigs. None of that happened to me, and I literally watched this movie in a theater by myself and wasn't worried a bit. Compared to the first Saw film, which had me not wanting to walk down my freshmen dorm hallway by myself at night, this film was like watching Peppa Pig at night (in perpetual fear she's going to hang up on me because I can whistle). Now, what I will say is Spiral was creative in the little games it had but they aren't as gross or bloody as Saws 4-7, which began only to do shock value and gore. I appreciate the filmmakers scaling back in that way while still attempting to push the envelope. But truly the plot was not enough. The move is straight forward compared to the the complicated web of stories in Saw. This is basically just the first level of Candy Crush where they basically just give you the win. It was quite disappointing but was executed well, I guess.Let's be honest, the Saw franchise is horror-iconic. It struck fear in people so much they started to be better people, but I didn't get any of that from this flick. Spiral tries to pick up the Saw mantle but the execution landed better with the comedy than it did with the horror and thrills. Moviegoers, I beg you to support the theaters especially as more movies debut, but Spiral isn't one to risk your life for. Check this handful of popcorn out when it hits the streaming services and even Redbox."

Spiral is just another Saw movie.It doesn't change the game or the rules, it just tries to give it another approach.Chris Rock may not be the right choice when it comes to horror or drama, but his work here was decent enough, yet it's far from turning this franchise around, which I think everyone was waiting for.At least speaking of the audiences that aren't fans, because if there were 7 sequels of the same thing, it's clear that those fans weren't expecting a reinvention.I can't say that I'm disappointed, because I didn't expect anything from this movie.Because even in the face of the little things that can be rescued, at this point to wait for a change has become futile.

The storyline was decent but written poorly."

They tried to keep up with the original movies with the editing (fast cuts, spinning camera, scary noises etc.) but often failed. The acting wasn't the greatest, too \"lazy\", too \"unbelievable\" in some parts. About the predictability for me: i didn't see the twist coming. If the whole movie was like the last 20 to 25 minutes, it would be an 8/10."

Chris Rock was better than I expected but I still think I'd like to have seen someone else in the role. Unfortunately though this was far too predictable as it's very obvious early on who the Jigsaw copycat is. Unlike other films there wasn't much subtlely. A shame as they had an opportunity here to make something really exciting."
