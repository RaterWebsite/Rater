The film lacks any heartwarming story and interesting relationships with most of the entertainment coming from the random scenes and cutaway gags that have little to do with the story.

Absolutely not, besides that's what makes it different. But Ted 2, Directed by Seth MacFarlane, Starring Mark Wahlberg, Seth MacFarlane, Amanda Seyfried, Giovanni Ribisi, and Morgan Freeman. In my opinion, what makes this film great is the performances of the cast, the unbelievably random ass humor, and the fact that it is a worthy sequel to the first film. Now, I could not stop laughing while watching Ted 2, there would always be a joke hiding somewhere, and when you least expect it, that joke comes out and it is so random that it would trigger another joke, and then another joke, and so on and so forth. The film also had a very good running joke that I didn't even expect the first time, it was when any of the characters would use their phone or a computer to search something up it would show, \"Did you mean Black Cocks?\", and every time that happened I burst into laughter. The performances of the cast was great, even the cameos were random, I mean we got Liam Neeson buying a box of Trix and asking Ted if it was weird that he was buying cereal meant for kids, David Hasselhoff crying on stage while talking about Knight Rider, Tom Brady freaking out after Johnny and Ted were in his house to jack him off for is sperm, Jay Leno being a gay guy who has sex in a bathroom in bar when everyone finds out that he had been doing just that, and so many others. The structure of the film was no different to the first film but it did improve.

Or, as I put it when I reviewed the first picture for another website, with such enthusiasm that I actually gave it three-and-a-half stars (I\u2019d adjust that to an even three if I could turn back time), \u201cit really is not quite so different than that of a standard romantic comedy in which a stand-up but somewhat immature guy has to fight off his lesser angels, largely embodied in a slackerish best-friend character, so as to become The Man (and Husband) he was Meant To Be.\u201d \u201cMan\u201d being Mark Wahlberg\u2019s John; \u201cslackerish best friend\u201d being the dirty-talking teddy bear, Ted, and eventual bride of man being Mila Kunis, who as it turned out showed plenty of good sense in not coming back for the sequel.\r With John now divorced and porn-addicted, it\u2019s up to exceptionally vulgar Ted to take up the storyline slack. \u201cTed 2\u201d begins with the bear, who could use a wash beyond soaping up his mouth, marrying former-good-time hottie Tami-Lynn at a wedding officiated by Sam Jones of \u201cFlash Gordon\u201d fame. (There\u2019s a lot of recycling from the first film here.) Soon their domestic bliss goes south, and the couple enact a quasi-parody of the \u201cRaging Bull\u201d \u201cyou bother me about a steak\u201d scene, which is rather queasily unfunny because the De Niro part is being played by a stuffed teddy bear rather than in spite of it.\r Aside from race jokes, \u201cTed 2\u201d offers a nearly staggering number of weed jokes, a couple of which are mildly funny, or at least funnier than the rape jokes. Then there are the gay panic jokes, the racial gay panic jokes, the celebrity cameo jokes, and long stretches of no jokes, oddly enough, stretches in which the creepy kidnapping subplot of the first film is recycled, and works much less well than it did in the first film, where it didn\u2019t quite work but, you know, the jokes were funnier. And so it goes.\r While the first film offered, by my casual recollection, almost two dozen belly laughs, this one barely registers four. The mean spiritedness oozes beyond the racial stuff and reaches fuller flower at the movie\u2019s climax, which is set at a comic geek convention, and yes, consider the possibilities. All aspiration to actual humor is set aside in favor of a hammering insistence on the sub-human qualities of fanboys, cosplayers and so on. It starts to get numbing after a while. Acridness combined with ineffective humor is a bad mix, and whatever goodwill the movie scored based on sentimental value or the few effective jokes in the front end is entirely spent by the end credits.

But then I heard news about a squeal in the works and then I heard that Amanda Seyfried, Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson was in the film and that alone give me a little interest in the movie just by that movie news. I wasn't jumping for excitement for this movie as I the movie didn't look anything special, just squeal bait.\r Now after seeing Ted 2 I'm not very impressed of what I watched, actually this movie is pretty bloated for it's own good.\r What I liked in the first Ted movie is the chemistry between Mark Wahlberg and the character Ted. They back and forward humor really worked if you would believe it, I mean a pot smoking talking teddy bear hanging around with Elliot Moore from The Happening would actually work is just beyond this world. And here they chemistry is still good just like in the first movie.\r The movie did make me laugh a couple of times as that's mainly Wahlberg and Seth chemistry in the movie and some other stuff that's only a small little nod to a film or TV and it was funny at first until late on where they stretched out the joke to the point were it got really old and really stale very fast. But I do think this movie is way better then Seth MacFarlane last movie A Million Way to Die in the West as that movie didn't even try and was pretty forgettable, I mean it's been a year since that movie came out and I forgotten pretty much all of it.\r What really surprise me is how messy the movie is and the movie doesn't know what it wants to be, because these three different things going on in this movie like Ted is trying to prove that he's a human because him and he's wife want a baby but Ted needs to prove he's human so he can be legally parent (Yeah I know it doesn't make any sense, just go for it for now) oh and these a road trip in the movie and remember that stalker in the first Ted movie that kidnapped Ted well he's back in this movie. That's the whole movie of Ted 2 for you. Oh one last thing, Ted 2 is kind of the same as the first, I wish I can go into details of that but that would be spoiling it for some people who may have interest of seeing this movie and I'm being nice here and won't be spoiling anything.\r Before seeing this movie I thought that Amanda Seyfried wasn't going to do anything great, I thought that she was just filling it in for the money, but I got to say that she was pretty good in the movie. She actually did something with the story and didn't feel like a background character. She was Wahlberg worked really well with each other and Ted as well. Same thing with Morgan Freeman.\r Overall Ted 2 isn't all that great to me. As I said before about a billion of times by now you may disagree and like the movie and completely overall on what I said, again that's fine that's cool, enjoy what you enjoy, but I'm sticking what I put down and it won't change anytime soon."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "The story is no where near as good as the original, It definitely drags on a lot and doesn't have much in terms of content.

Another aspect is that so much of Ted 2 is spent either talking about or copying other movies that very little of it is actually original. It goes without saying, the film's not very intelligent, despite it's moments, and that illustrates the most obvious flaw of this film. The film is tonally and narratively erratic, one moment the film's silly, the next it's really dark, and the plot runs like an extended episode of family guy.

There was not a moment where I found myself bored, or uninterested. There was constantly something going on that kept me eagerly watching! I laughed a lot, I felt upset, and I felt excited. I felt an array of emotions. Any movie that does this simply could not sieze to be good! The plot was very meaningful, involving the pursuit of Ted's human rights - something we can relate to our world. This movie makes you feel good and does not stop at any length to entertain you. Nothing was dragged out too long, no part of the movie felt unnecessary or stupid and none of it was overly predictable.\r Go and watch this movie if you enjoyed the last one. You'll be impressed.

Also, Seth MacFarlane's sweet tooth for misplaced musical numbers makes its way to the final finished movie. I really think that MacFarlane's team could have spent more time with Ted 2, to make it even better than its predecessor. Well, too bad. Copied spoofs for Family Guy, tiring cameos and horrible pacing are just some of the problems with this movie. Ted 2 is more of the same, which is good for some movies, but I think that we wanted something fresh and new rather than a flimsy cast with a few adjustments and a wafer thin script. But, the chemistry between Johnny and Ted is electrifying. And, Amanda Seyfried is decent too. But, Marky Mark is TOTTALY lifeless.

If not, it might still be an enjoyable experience, though a black sense of humour is recommended."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This was the funniest movie I have seen in a very long time. I laughed so hard in the theater I thought I was gonna fall out of the seat. Best comedy of the year by far and I have seen all the big one's. Funnier than Spy or anything else. If you want to have a great time go see this movie"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Ted 2 isn't as bad as everyone says it is. I thought it was hilarious and much funnier than the first one. It kept me entertained and although some parts were boring, overall I really liked it."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Maybe not quite as funny as the first one, but still pretty funny.  I love Seth's sense of humor.  If you love Family Guy or saw Ted and laugh at his sense of humor, you'll love Ted 2."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Wow, well that was truly disappointing. First of all I want to mention that I have watched the extended cut which adds around 10 minutes more of tediousness (no pun intended), and I honestly would have picked the shorter version had I known how bad and boring this movie is.\rTo be honest, one could tell that the ride is not going to be a fun one after having to endure the opening credits dance sequence which is strikingly reminiscent of that of the Family Guy, only it is almost 3 minutes long. Clocking at around two hours, the extended Ted 2 is full of exhausting moralizing clich\u00e9 talks about how the legal system is supposed to treat everyone equally, \"protagonists going somewhere\" montages (and some other montages, like \"protagonists prepare for a court hearing\"), unmemorable dialogues, unfunny pot jokes, more unfunny jokes unrelated to pot (an added bonus is Mark Wahlberg covered in fake semen. At least I think that it's fake. Maybe.) and occasionally, about once in 40 minutes, gags that actually provoke some laughter. And those gags are not nearly hilarious enough to justify sitting through all the monotony in between.\rI truly liked the first Ted. I found \"A million ways to die in the west\" to be inferior, but still enjoyable. This one, however, dropped the bar so low you can see the rock bottom from here, gotta hope that the trend with Seth MacFarlane's movies' quality turns around. The last line of Ted 2 is \"hashtag Sh*t Happens\". That is quite ironic, as it is a fairly accurate description of this movie's creation."}], "recommendations": ["this_is_the_end", "jackass_presents_bad_grandpa", "anchorman_2_the_legend_continues", "a_million_ways_to_die_in_the_west", "the_hangover_part_ii", "dinner_for_schmucks", "jexi", "the_hangover", "30_minutes_or_less", "ted", "identity_thief", "neighbors_2_sorority_rising", "neighbors", "the_dictator", "the_happytime_murders", "hot_tub_time_machine", "step_brothers", "knocked_up", "little_fockers", "rough_night", "22_jump_street", "the_hangover_part_iii", "deadpool_2", "the_watch", "the_wedding_ringer"]}
