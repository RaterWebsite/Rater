      "text": "Free Birds isn't a disaster, merely a bloated stab at family entertainment (and a spiffy commercial for Chuck E. Cheese pizza, which I'm only now learning is something people in America actually have delivered). It's a hero's tale, it's a sci-fi riff, it's a history lesson, it's a portrait of friendship, it's Braveheart with turkeys, it's a pop culture bonanza cut from the Shrek cloth, and together it's none of these. It's the turducken of animated comedies, and while it might satisfy kids, it's not the healthiest option.  A stew of half-baked plot elements and bird-brained bits pulled from other movies doesn't make the slapstick toon Free Birds a particularly satisfying experience."

I admit it's bad, but at least I like. a little. the story is something out of the ordinary, a few birds, or turkeys, or chickens. WTF WHAT ARE THEY? on a mission to prevent the turkey be the Thanksgiving meal? it is something original, however it is not liked by many. the characters are forgettable, especially jake. music is forgettable, i almost not hear music in the action scenes. (My opinion) is a film to hang out with your family, or rather with your younger brother or cousin. yes i liked, more or less. free birds is not a bad film to 100% if you compare it with other bad movies of 2013, as planes."

I can't say too many adults will find it tolerable, but I found it to be fairly entertaining. The voice cast is top-notch with the likes of Owen Wilson and Woody Harrelson, but the animation is far from impressive. Still it gets the job done. The plot is decent even if it can get a little muddled and there are plenty of laughs here. The theme of the movie is odd but I can still see kids being plenty entertained, and maybe even their parents as well. It's not among the best animated movies out there, but there are still reasons to give it a shot."

There were fourth-wall moments towards the audience which kind of made the film more like a parody of how a certain action film is supposed to be, it was a hilarious moment. I recommend you watch it, because I find the film entertaining and worth the time."

      "text": "Free Birds is sure to entertain small children with its bright colors, light hearted tone (except for one scene), and nice humor. However, everyone else will probably be uninterested and/or bored as the film has little to offer. The story lacks any real substance and has a poorly constructed ending, the characters are not that interesting with the only interesting ones being interesting more for the actor voicing them then the character themselves, and the film doesn\u2019t deliver in the comedy department as much as it should. However, I can\u2019t hate this film as it didn\u2019t get under my skin or make me role my eyes. The film gave me some amusement but also some shallow righting so it falls in the middle with me neither disliking nor hating the film. Check it out if you are interested but if you don\u2019t care I don\u2019t blame you if you skip it as this film doesn\u2019t have much to offer anyone outside of little kids."

      "text": "Mission thanksgiving. The turkeys time to fight back!\r It is definitely an underrated animation. Okay, I agree, Disney is solely dominating the animation industry, especially at present. But this film is no masterpiece like that Disney makes yet not bad to ignore complete. Yes, there are flaws in it, but very acceptable as they're just minors. In the animations, the real world logics won't apply. So you should try to enjoy it than trying to find the errors.\r This film is targeted for children, but then anybody can watch it because it is a beautiful theme with some real laughs in it, only if you forget that you are an adult for a 90 minute. Technically the film quality matches with Disney, Pixer, Dreamworks and even the Sony animation. It is a fine achievement for an outside/new production house to come up with like this. I hope Reel FX would make more animations in the future and compete directly with these top companies.\r It was really a star studded cast. I did not know who were they all, but I identified them by their voices. As far as the story, too easy to predict, but somehow it managed to keep me glued to it with its entertaining contents. It is a time travel theme and a quite entertaining film made by the 'Horton Hears a Who' director.\r Some are saying it is anti-thanking giving film, but I think it is just a fun film. Although, it was kind of like 'Happy Feet', where a bunch of turkeys tries to loose their kind from the humans grip. But narrated differently, something like in the line of 'Penguins of Madagascar'. I don't think anybody can regret watching it, but then there are people with expectations, so it might fail at them. Overall, it was a decent film for sure if not great as other animations that came in the same year. Waiting for its sequel about 'mission turducken'.\r 7/10"

The premise was awful, the acting was weak, the animation was sub-par, the message was irrelevant, and we had to leave the theatre after half an hour. The funniest bit was a strange double entente that I don't even think was intentional. The worst film I have ever seen, and I've seen The Room."

Most of the characters weren't that interesting though, especially the main character, who I think could've been fleshed out a bit more, and some of the voices didn't seem to fit their character, probably because of some of the previous work they have done, such as the main character, Owen Wilson being in Cars, all of a sudden being a wimpy turkey."

Inappropriate to tell youth these are acceptable terms to use on other people and to make fun of a culture and degrade their integrity with a cartoon mockery of an original American culture. History is horrible and people are mean in real-life.. But this is one of those movies that make it 'okay' for kids to say \"It was just a joke!\" when it harms other peoples image or emotional well being.  A must see to teach your kids how NOT to act."
