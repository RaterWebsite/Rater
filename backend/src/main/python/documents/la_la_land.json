      "text": "After watching this film at the Chicago International Film Festival, my original plan was to wait until closer to the film's actual release date to give my thoughts on it. However, after sitting with it for two days, with the images and sounds still sweeping through my mind, I cannot help myself. I will be as vague as possible, because I do not want to ruin the experience of seeing it for the first time, but I have to talk about it.La La Land, as it has been advertised, pays homage to classic movie musicals. Not only does it visually allude to films such as Singin' in the Rain and The Band Wagon, but it also preserves the upbeat, wondrous tone of those classics. There is something wonderful about seeing this tone and style recreated for a modern film. Cynicism and pretentiousness are completely absent from this film, and nostalgia and joy take their place.But calling La La Land a terrific recreation of the classic movie musical is selling it short. Like director Damien Chazelle's previous work, La La Land has much more going on narratively than the movie may lead people to believe. On the surface, this is a love story about two artists trying to make their ways in Los Angeles. However, this framework is deceptively simple.La La Land forces us to think about the realities of personal relationships and artistic endeavors. It explores the excitement of our dreams, the hardships of pursuing these dreams, and forces the audience to question the importance of both. Fortunately, Chazelle never looks down on the audience with these ideas. They are not presented in a heavy handed manner, and he never forces you to think a certain way.On top of its thematic richness, La La Land has one of the best understandings of film as a storytelling medium that I have seen in recent years. On the surface, it is the most technically astounding. The cinematography is stunning, and the soundtrack is beautiful. Even better is that both the visuals and soundtrack are never used in a way that is shallow or uninteresting. La La Land has an understanding of how to tell a story visually. It understands the power of sequencing, the power images can have on the emotional impact of a story, and the way in which these images simultaneously indulge our fantasies and remind us of our humanity.In other words, for me, it embodies everything that I love about movies.There are instances that everyone can recall in a cinema where we have felt what I like to call \"movie magic.\" These are evoked by the films that completely absorb us into its world, and movies that have a lasting, personal impact on us far beyond the theater. They are the films that we hold as the pinnacle of what makes watching movies so great.La La Land is one of those movies.During its 128 minute running time, the only time I wanted to look away from the screen was to turn to the people around me and check and see if they were experiencing the same kind of magic that I was. I can affirm that everyone I saw in my theater was.La La Land is a masterpiece. It is not only the best movie of 2016 so far, but also possibly one of the best of the decade. It's spectacular, stunning, moving, and absolutely magical."

I've never cared for Ryan Gosling or John Legend, and I still have no use for either. The whole movie fell flat. The opening scene was not entertaining. Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly and Donald O'Conner must be rolling in their graves and rolling their eyes at this one. Best movie of the year? You cannot be serious!"

The idea that life happens in seasons is powerful, and that sometimes great things come to an end.  The cute couple doesn't always end up together.The music was the best I've ever heard. As I watched the opening scene play before me, I was inspired by their choreography and musical complexity.  I was instantly entranced in the mood of the movie.  La La Land takes a well-paced approach to the idea of Hollywood and shows the biting realism of life.Overall, the movie mixes musical and instrumental prowess with skilled performances from Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling to make a film that felt more real than any I've watched before."

      "text": "Gosling and Stone shines and as a result Chazelle marks his name on the wall.La La LandChazelle is on a strike. With successive jaw dropping projects coming out, his passion grows more intense and the cinema much larger. Coloring the 70mm screen with rich mesmeric visuals, the director, Damien Chazelle is boasting his love with proper understanding of the Hollywood culture that he so blindingly adores. Not an inch goes by in the film that looks pretentious, working over a year on editing along with Tom Cross, Chazelle wishes you to understand the \"if's\" and \"but's\" of this show business in one note. And boy what a note it is. I am sorry but that hooked theme of Justin Hurwitz, whispered in every line of the film always sobers me up.All hail the production team for carving out this desert as fresh as it looks, from clothes to designing and from locations to set pieces, the view gets better and better and so does the performance. And daunting as this task may sound, but Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling might be the new Woody Allen and Diane Keaton. But unlike them they aren't quirky but are goofy about the relationship and flirty about their first love. If Stone going over the montages of failed auditions is a threat, then Gosling on piano is her equal competitor.I have always preferred them alone, one is happy being stubborn and intuitive- something that she later on adapts from him- and other being mature and hard on herself. Together, they would fall apart, they are meant to be, no matter how in sync are they while dancing and how pitch perfect are they while singing, their rhythm is too vacuumed by the outer world to float in one room, maybe they should have just stayed in that cinema hall, but despite of claiming it to be a La La Land, this is the reality, they had to get out."

      "text": "From the talented director of Whiplash, comes another musical masterpiece: La La Land. This movie is about the romance of aspiring actress Mia (Emma Stone) and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), they both have great chemistry and they're one of the best movie couples in recent cinema, director Damien Chazelle had the talent to write and develop their relationship really well. As this is a musical, it obviously has many musical numbers throughout the movie and they're all fantastic and serve a purpose to the plot.The Good:-The performances are amazing.-The script, dialogue and character development are great. The chemistry between the main characters is just wonderful.-The score and music is memorable and beautiful.-The ending scene is one of the best ending scenes I've seen in a long time and the message it tries to give is sad but true: That sometimes couples need to separate and both go in different ways to accomplish their dreams. It's a lighthearted, depressing yet satisfying ending and it's more tearjerking with the beautiful music, the last shot of the movie is Mia and Seb smiling to each other is an amazing ending, pretty refreshing to see a couple actually not ending together, it makes the ending unpredictable.-Obviously the rest of the movie is as amazing as that last scene. The musical numbers are memorable, catchy and well choreographed.The Bad:-I think the only \"bad\" or not so good thing is Ryan Gosling's acting as Sebastian. He did a good job but he didn't really shine as much as other actors, specially his in-movie couple Mia (Emma Stone).La La Land is a masterpiece of a movie, I could watch it over and over and nothing of it will ever get old at least for me."

Pero hay una cosa que no se puede negar, la musica de esta obra, llego para quedarse, siendo mis favoritas Another Day Of Sun, Someone In The Crowd y City of Stars, son totalmente memorables y hasta uno le da una buenas energ\u00edas al momento de escucharlas. Y pues claro, que se puede esperar del mismo que dirigi\u00f3 Whiplash, que ahora va a estar a boca de muchos en esta nueva era de cine como lo esta siendo como I\u00f1\u00e1rritu o Guillermo del Toro que esta volviendo a sacar relevancia en estos tiempos.Quiz\u00e1s no sea la pel\u00edcula que va a cambiar la industria, pero es una que deben apreciar a los que les gusta de buen cine y de aprender a analizar las caracter\u00edsticas que conforman una pel\u00edcula para los estudiantes o cr\u00edticos que estudian cine.Aunque mi favorita para los Oscares seguir\u00e1 siendo Arrival."

Kudos to Damien Chazelle for taking a moribund genre (the Hollywood musical), updating it for the 2010s, and giving it new life.  Gosling and Stone, who are great together, play a couple of struggling artists (he, a disgruntled jazz musician, and she, an actress) who meet and fall in love.  Parts of Los Angeles become key features in the movie and serve as wonderful backdrops for musical numbers.  The ending for me is a little unsatisfying, and it left me scratching my head over what really happened between them, which isn't the best way to end a romantic musical - but this is still a lovely ride, and one with no peers that I know of."

For the first time, I saw this movie in the cinema last year when we went to see it with classmates. The genre of the film is a musical romantic, comedy and drama film, and the film was released on August 31, 2016. The film employ and location is in California. In the same year, the film also nominated for the Oscars.Actress Mia tries to play a famous play where she wants to take part. She will work in the breakfast cafe otherwise there is a waitress. Because she has a sad mood the same evening, then she will have a restaurant in the evening and a muscian Sebastian, whom she will soon fall in love, will play the piano. The same night, Sebastian was fired from work, as the restaurant manager wanted to put his restaurant around for a band to listen to people. Sebastian goes to work on one of the record labels, and Mia begins to create her own play. The film employ is very fast-moving. At the end of the film, they admit to each other that while they care about each other, they will not be able to live together in the future.It seemed to me that the film is light-hearted and there were different twists and turns in the film. There were a lot of different details and effects in the film that changed the film\u00b4s environment. This film had a big-budget, but it is a world-famous piece of musical.My opinion about the film is very good, because people dance and sing a lot, and this make the movie a great one. I recommend this movie to people: first, who like musicals and secondly, dream far away from the world."

It includes impeccably choreographed dancing, great songs and an excellent score, along with excellent performances from Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. Chazelle's direction is very assured and the movie has excellent cinematography. It's visuals and excellent musical numbers allude to classic musicals with an upbeat, and dream-like tone. The movie can be interpreted in several ways, but for a less discerning viewer the subtle message of being willing to let go with each other to follow your dreams could be missed, if so i recommend a second viewing. Both Mia and Sebastian achieve their dreams but the movie shows a beautiful and heartbreaking montage of what could have been if their relationship was perfect. But the whimsical tone is contrasted with raw emotion and shows the reality of going to L.A. to achieve your dreams. La La Land was the best movie of 2016 and must be seen. I watched La La Land recently, my expectations weren't that high, I was expecting a good movie, but not a masterpiece on the level of this film. La La Land is an instant classic."

You'll be smiling from minute one with the Original intro with 'Another day of sun' sung by a whole bunch of dancers dancing on the freeway. It ends a bit more sad, with the broken up couple looking back to the movie with some happy and sad music.Great experience, if you didn't liked it the first time, be sure to give it a second try, changes your perspective and gives you a better look at the movie and its characters.On of my all time favorites for sure."

Esta forma de narrativa tambien tiene sus defectos porque si quieres transmitir emociones profundas o tristes no se lograra del todo puesto que el sonido ritmico y el escenario colorido de la pelicula te dira todo los contrario y aunque la iluminacion es bastante buena en otras escenas se pudo mejorar.
