The story is simple and well-structured. This movie is full of suspense, horror, thrill action, twist, and turns. I enjoyed my 2 hours completely. The internal plots are so heart-touching. A mother who is fighting her evil for the sake of her kid is such a clever and impressive point added in this movie. The character development is great, the acting is too good, the makeup of vampires is excellent and the all-over cinematography is great."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "What an enjoyable vampire movie!

Moments of high suspense as we root for an anti-hero who is also trying to rein in her own bloodthirsty instincts."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Created an account just for this Gem, I\u2019ve never rated a movie before, but these Karen reviews got me feeling like I have to defend what\u2019s overlooked...Ps: Watched with Subtitles and English Dubbed"}, {"rating": "6", "text": "(In honor of the you tube \"pitch\" guy from Screen Rant) Hey, do you remember that Jodie Foster movie with her on a plane? Vaguely. How about the one with Rachel McAdams and Gillian Murphy? Oh yeah the Wes Craven one, I kinda liked that one. Why do you ask? Well what if we made her character, wait for it...a vampire? Okayy? Blood Red Sky begins with the time honored movie tradition of beginning the movie at end, then taking us back to the events that got us to that point. A highjacked plane lands at an airstrip surrounded by police and out emerges from the cargo hold a young boy. Cue the backtrack. The boy and his mother, who appears to be suffering from cancer, board a trans Atlantic flight, that is soon taken over by terrorists. The mother is shot, and presumably killed, by a sadistic member of the terrorists (guess who becomes the main antagonist of the group..). Much to everyone's shock, she ends up much alive, or non-alive. So it's Air Force One, but instead of the president running around the bowels of the plane trying to foil terrorists, it's a vampire. It's such a ridiculous premise that you think it'll be some dumb, campy fun. The problem is that the tone is so earnest, it sucks (ha ha) the fun out of it. Do we need extended flashbacks detailing her becoming a vampire? The lead actress does well and the vampire makeup is very feral and animalistic. Her son has the most annoying performance since Sean Connery' s son in Outland. It's not bad. I'd say a B minus for a B movie."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "A surprising gem. The film runs a bit long but the story is interesting. Hijackers on a plane get a little more than they bargained for in the form of a vampire passenger.

The acting from everybody except the protagonist women Nadja is bad to horrible. Lines come off very unnatural. When the action starts, the characters start to act dumb.

It had a promising beginning, as its concept (the hijackers, not the vampires) is actually pretty cool. Then the woman turned into a **** vampire and it kind of lost me.

Basic 'monsters/vampires' movie mixed with a 'we're trapped on a plane' movie. Pretty lackluster, unsurprisingly and obvious plotpoints. A lot of blood for the sake of blood.

It has been a busy few weeks, but that doesn't mean the streaming stops. This week we noticed the release of Blood Red Sky on July 23, 2021. The movie poster and caption peaked my interest, but the 2 hour runtime frightened me. I mean can I really pull myself away from the Olympics 2020 for a whole two hours? Well, I managed to do so and let's see how it turned out.Blood Red Sky is about a woman with a mysterious illness forced to protect her son when terrorists attempt to hijack their flight to America. I know you're saying... what illness does this poor, loving mom have? Well, that's for me to know and you to find out when you watch; but, whatever she has, I don't want. This movie is a mash up of a bunch of storylines we all enjoy. Hijacked planes, people fighting bad guys, and horror! Slightly creative but ultimately feels like a longer version of World War Z mixed with District 9 and 30 Days of Night scenes. It's a basic premise that takes a really long time to develop. And yet I know that I'm tired of these Monkey Loving terrorists on this Mother Fighting plane! *Samuel L. Voice* I will say the brutality of the terrorists was a little fun because a couple are familiar faces from other movies and shows. I'm looking at you Heat Wave/Mick Rory and Chidi Ajufo. Realistically, the actors do a good job of simultaneously making us hate the terrorists but also like them all at once. Otherwise, there's not much to the acting in this film but Carl Koch, as Elias, and Kais Setti, as Farid, do a pretty good job for their roles. Both are able to portray the severity, fear, panic, and empathy that the moment needs. I know that's confusing and intriguing at the same time.Needless to say, Blood Red Sky never needed to be made but I'm surprised that I'm glad it was. Honestly, I might have been a little mad if I'd paid to see this in the theater but for free, I'm pleasantly surprised. If you love a good vampire chase movie, then you'll enjoy this flick. Blood Red Sky keeps it interesting and full of anxiety throughout the movie, even though the storyline falls off hard midway through and the movie drags on for too long. If you're into horror flicks and don't mind the fa\u00e7ade of a heist flick, I say turn to Netflix and check this one out with a bowl of popcorn. It's not must see TV but it won't let you down in a jam."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "My biggest thought during this movie is \"I wish they would push Elias out of the plane.\"  I'm sure we were supposed to be touched by his love for his mother, but I found him immensely annoying and supremely stupid."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "A woman and her son are on a transatlantic flight when terrorists commandeer the plane. Turns out she has \u201cblood issues,\u201d which transforms her into a vampire (flashbacks explain the origins). The film entertains on several levels. The aircraft\u2019s takeover is stressful. The vampire twist ramps up the action. The strife between her mother\u2019s instincts and her bestial impulse adds a touching layer of drama. Even so, the tension stays taut, while the script keeps tossing in surprising turns. Pure popcorn fun with blood, violence and vampires.
