      "text": "The sequel of 1 is a bit disappointing because f the mashup  of roles and you cant easily know who is  who. There are some scenes after the switch I was really knot knowing whois who  . Fiona  is the best among the characters  with the very sexy silhouette and her funny gang members Vanessa again rocks with the three distinct characters she plays"
