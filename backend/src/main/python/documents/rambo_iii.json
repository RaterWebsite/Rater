      "text": "I quite liked First Blood made in 1982, First Blood part II was stupid but okay.. Then Rambo III was made and it's a stinker especially when a tank is blown up with Rambo inside and he gets out uninjured. Sylvester Stallone's worst if not one of the worst Rambo films ever made. So unrealistic and too violent it's a real insult to not only Stallone but the viewer. Not only is the action scenes unrealistic and stupid but Rambo III is a very boring film and even the action can't save it. A massive failure from Sylvester Stallone and an awful film!"

For people saying it is propaganda film etc, in a way all Rambo movies where, you don't have to treat them as history. I actually think it would be more weird for Americans now this movie than when it was released, since all the problems with Afghanistan"

      "text": "Rambo III ... well, the jumping doll. It was a cut. One had great action, but two shoved it into her pocket and it was nothing. But the third part gave it a crown, because this is a really INCREDIBLE action room! A story in style, as in previous films. Something has been talked about for a while. But it doesn't take long and Rambo gets the mission. From now on, the film is the event itself, which is perhaps the best in the series. Maybe I also liked it because we are in the desert in the film and I love the deserts, especially the action passages in them. I don't have much to add to this. The film is quite far from number one. It is more like a double, but it still surpasses it in action and thus created a luxurious spectacle that could explode everywhere. Lovers of action just do it. Don't expect fans of quality stories from this film. For me, a good film that I recommend."

      "text": "What is one of the most cliche things in action movies? In the middle of the rush, the hero finds a badass woman to save and it stops the action scenes for more dramatic speeches. Well, Rambo III has no girls. And it has no stop either. Even the scene that Rambo is enjoying a game with horses is interrupted by hellicopters, bombs and explosions. So, what else do you need? It's an awesome mindless rush of shootings. Let me put this on other way: Do you know that scene on Rambo: First Blood Part II that Stallone enters the hangar with a M60 and shoots the hell out of computers and displays? It's that with people instead of screens and 102-min long."

There are no big differences from the second film. Only the scenery has changed. Perhaps Rambo himself has changed. In the second film he was more secretive, in the third film he is the real Terminator."

Of course Rambo = USA is good, this time Sowjets are bad. So yes the movie is propaganda.There are no interesting characters, the story is simple. So in the end the movie is only about action and this is not bad."

Aun asi, las escenas de acci\u00f3n estuvieron a la altura como siempre y Rambo sigue siendo super carism\u00e1tico, aunque creo que la actuaci\u00f3n de Truntman dejo bastante que desear. Buena pel\u00edcula, pero en mi opini\u00f3n es la peor de la trilog\u00eda."
