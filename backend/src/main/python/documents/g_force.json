But anyone with close to mature social skills will find the human acting poorly done, the script entirely unoriginal to the point that your hair might curl on the should-be motivating moments, and you'll guess what happens before it happens, every time. The only reason this got a 2, and not a 1, is because it is funny in some places. It's not really really funny, but it makes you chuckle. If you want something mindless, this is a movie to watch.

Seriously, who thinks of these things. Don't bother going, its a waste of money like most random things are..."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "\"G-Force\" functions like a Happy Meal. This mini-\"MI\" contains the same meat and potatoes(action) found in your typical Hollywood fare, but it's scaled down(no violence, no profanity, no sex), with the added incentive of toys(guinea pigs) to lure kids. That's smart marketing. Get them hooked on fast films while they're young and Hollywood has itself a customer, a spectacle junkie, for life. Laden with a heavy \"Transformers\" influence, \"G-Force\" is also within shouting distance of Orwellian dystopia, but sadly, never transforms into \"Animal Farm\". Because \"G-Force\" colludes filmically with dominant ideological principles, Speckles(voiced by Nicholas Cage), the \"traitorous\" mole who avenges the deaths of his own kind, gets misinterpreted as the villain, since the post-colonial-minded Darwin(voiced by Sam Rockwell) sides with the humans. Even though guinea pigs are disposable creatures, \"G-Force\" depicts man as infallible, therefore, the diegesis is fraught with ideological purity. A more ambitious film would have the varmints joining Speckles' rebellion, especially after Ben(Zach Galifanakis) lies about their origins. Like the reactionary pig from Chris Noonan's \"Babe\", the guinea pigs sell-out their own species. Since Darwin preaches Ben's concept of family to the disgruntled mole with such fidelity, the bourgeoise guinea pig(look at how uppity he and his G-Force colleagues act in the pet shop) should be crestfallen(and irate) about the suppression of his proletarian background. But like a true patriot, Darwin never questions Ben's authority. \"G-Force\" denies the dialectic at hand by resolving Darwin's moral dilemma with its leanings toward conservative ideology. \"G-Force\" is a happy film."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "G-Force isn't a bad movie. The problem is that it doesn't appeal to a wide enough audience. Also, the climax goes from awesome to lame really fast and 3-D has been used so much in just one year that it has lost it's magic. Nonetheless, G-Force is definitely worth checking out due it's funny jokes here and there and superb voiceovers by Nicholas Cage and Tracy Morgan."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "This movie is horrible and stupid, don't waste your time or money on this crap."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Too much potty humor.

Yup sounds like and is, a non animated Disney movie."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "I hope you like fart jokes because G-Force has a lot of them. G-Force fails in almost every respect, and will only entertain children. Small children. G-Force is about three guinea pigs who are genetically engineered to talk and be spies. But these rodents are out of the job when they're thrown into a pet shop when the government disapproves of the G-Force team. They meet another guinea pig named Hurley, and together, they escape the pet shop and attempt to save the world from killer kitchen appliances. G-Force offers, quite literally, nothing that's original or anything that I haven't seen before on film. G-Force is always trying to be funny. The gags never stop, but I never laughed a single time. I think I smiled twice, and the second time was a smile of relief when the movie was over! The action scenes were predictably dull. As the movie went on, it became more and more obvious that this film is strictly for toddlers. There are no \"wink wink for adults\" gags. The musical score rips of countless movies, many lines are laughably cheesy. Lots of contradictions in character personalities. When G-Force doesn't feel rushed, it feels slow and dull. We hear \"I've got a feelin'\" three times throughout the tedious duration of the film. Pacing is an issue. The acting is mostly wooden. Need I go on? On the plus side, there are some good visuals (the CGI work is actually pretty good), and the voice work is decent, if unspectacular. Many of the good visuals are present during the \"fly\" scenes where one of the recruits, a fly named mooch, is shown wizzing through desserts, Venus fly traps, etc. If you have kids, G-Force will probably entertain them. But there are lots of other better films out there that will do the same thing. I can't stress this enough: Don't watch G-Force."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Bland with little entertaining value.
