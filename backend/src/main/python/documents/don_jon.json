It's probably not REALLY for main-stream consumers, macho boys and candy princess girls. It's not for any of these because it is, at it's heart, an attempt to savage the values that all these groups hold dear. It shines a hot and otherwise absentee light the cancer of over-sexualization. It shows, subtly at times and baldly at others, how consumer driven, sexualized, culture has reached it's tendrils into every-day life, down even into the language we use, how we think and what we think we need. No character is safe, even the heroine, who chastises the male lead for being \"addicted to porn\" does so while lighting a joint. Entertaining, lighthearted and even touching, this movie, like it's main character, seems dumb on the outside but turns out to be intelligent after all. In fact it's really intelligent, which will hurt it's reviews. It's irreverence (which I love) makes it's target market small and it's high bar of entry (most people won't \"get it\") makes it's target audience smaller still. I took off a point the ending feeling rushed, but truly, I laughed my head off the whole time. If you're not in any of those listed groups, or if you're genuinely interested in gender roles, feminism, or sociology, you need to see this."

This is a film about an otherwise normal middle class guy who is addicted to watching porn on the internet and how it impacts and affects his other relationships. The film also stars Scarlett Johannson and Juliana Moore and a miscast Tony Danza as these actors struggle to make sense of this thin script and average direction, What could have been an interesting and insightful excursion into the mind and attitude of a porn addict becomes nothing more than a light overview of this potentially thought provoking subject.  I give the filma 6 and suggest that if something else is playing at the same time you are going to attend the movie, see the other film."

      "text": "I thought it was a smart, funny, scathing, but ultimately kind indictment of douche bro society.\r The repetitiveness and shallowness of man child Jon's existence speaks loudly to my millenial sensibilities. A victim of a self centered father and over accommodating mother, Jon is a self centered douche bag, whose only goal in life is to have meaningless fun. The blank faces on Jon's family during church and his road rage on the way there speak towards the emptiness of being nominally religious. The meaningless confession of sins, the meaningless prayers, all contribute to Jon's status as a shallow guy who doesn't really care about anything but banging an equally shallow and ridiculously hot girl and then spanking it to some meticulously selected pornography.\r I think the fact that Barbara isn't actually a good person is a really important part of the film. That neither party in the Jon/Barbara relationship is actually that likable, despite both of them being very good looking, is pretty refreshing.\r I really liked that Jon isn't actually that likable. He's charming, but he's a self centered dick with nothing really to say. And then he grows and he's still kind of a dick and he doesn't really have that much to say, but he is less self centered and I think that's a lot more honest than most other films.\r I think attacking the tendency to be self centered through porn addiction was really clever. Self centeredness is kind of this internal thing with tons of symptoms, but it's really hard to pull at something and make a difference. With Barbara it manifests as manipulativeness, which I think is a really hard thing to make a person aware of in a meaningful way. With porn addiction it's a pretty straight shot to, you have a problem because you can't get off without porn.\r I enjoyed it, I liked watching Jon struggle and grow, I liked that the ultimate love interest is really screwed up for totally believable reasons, I liked that no one is actually that likable. It feels like reality, but slightly prettier, as opposed to fantasy."

When he meets the girl of his dreams (Scarlett Johannson who embodies the tough, slutty borough girl), his obsession with pornography becomes an issue. This is a fast-paced, quick-witted character study about a man who's more of a mess than he seems. Gordon-Levitt has fully immersed himself in the character and it's a winner. His scenes of dinner with his dad (Tony Danza) are great fun.

All I got from it was a movie about porn addiction, period. Mentally I wrote it off. Today I made a critical mistake. I normally don\u2019t read the reviews of movies I know don\u2019t give me a single spark of interest, only the sparky ones. Alas, the reviews were surprisingly  acceptable and I went to a morning matinee. What a waste. It was a movie  about porn addiction of course, but I assumed from the reviews there were many redeeming qualities and growth in the characters included. WRONG! Joseph Gordon-Levitt & his father Tony Danza were simply vacuous, crude, foul-mouthed and valueless all the way to the closing credits. There was zero empathy or sympathy and not a hint of anyone being a protagonist.  I not only did not care about the males in this film, I was repulsed by them. The Catholic sacrament of \u201cconfession\u201d was treated like an irrelevant waste basket for immoral behavior rather than anything sacred or religious and demanding of sincere repentance as it does in real life.  Scarlett Johansson and Julianne Moore performances were very good actually. This movie had one theme and one theme only\u2026promiscuitypornpromiscuityporn. I spent the last 30 minutes mentally flipping a coin on whether to just get up and leave. I stayed because I wanted to write an honest review on a complete product. On the way out a group of five in front of me complained out loud about their waste of time and money on that piece of trash. I chimed in with them as we left the theater."

It's early, learned behaviour and as long as it doesn't become an obsession as it does to Don Jon, it's relatively meaningless.\rI thought the dialogue and relationship Don Jon had with Julianne Moore's character was artificial and hard to swallow as real, although it was key to the story.\r Worth seeing but could open a can of worms as a date movie.

Her character is gorgeous and awful but you just want her to come back. Ultimately, DON JON feels like a short film stretched to 90 minutes.

There are many men in the world like the character Don John, as there are women like Scarlett Johansson's Barbara. The movie is funny at first...quite funny actually...and then it moves into a coming-of-age story for Don John, with his first discovery of what authentic intimacy looks like. Our culture is awash in pornography, and our young men of this generation grow up assaulted by images that distort reality and crassify culture. Jordan Leavitt's film placed a spotlight on this problem without preaching, and gave some welcome guidance as to the way out of that morass if you are a man stuck in that mode. It is an excellent film...look behind the genuine character comedy for the deeper message."

Certainly debatable if its a date movie, but its a mans movie. I'm sure going in, people were expecting the chick flick. Ya know, where the guy gets the girl, they briefly break-up, and guy does everything to get her back. It wasn't that. It ended differently, and it was fantastic.

      "text": "As a native of northern New Jersey who grew up with many Italian working-class friends, I strongly resented the unnaturally thick Jersey accent as portrayed by Scarlett Johansson in her role as Barbara Sugarman. Sugarman is a Jewish name, as noted by the parents of Jon Martello (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) when he brings her home and introduces her to his Italian-American family, although in one scene Johansson sports a crucifix around her neck, so that detail was either a mistake or she was supposed to have had a Christian mother and a Jewish father. In any case, the film was directed and written by Gordon-Levitt, who is admittedly showing signs of youthful genius (but not necessarily in this film); however, Gordon-Levitt was born in Los Angeles, and like a lot of Hollywood actors and directors who did not grow up in industrialized northern New Jersey, his concept of a primitive, uncultured working class in New Jersey, especially of Italian origin, is highly exaggerated and misconceived. Yes, Ol' Blue Eyes came from Hoboken, and it is there that you will find the thickest so-called \u201cJoisey\u201d accent, but that is because of Hoboken's proximity to New York City, which is standing right there on the opposite shore of the Hudson. Indeed, that accent originates from the depths of Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. It affects parts of New Jersey by association only. The erroneous concept that this accent originated in New Jersey goes hand-in-hand with the Hollywood belief that New Jersey is the cultural pits of the planet.\r For the record, I have never met a New Jerseyan who talks like that. As noted, it is only in limited parts of North and Central Jersey where the New York City dialect is spoken. The majority of the state can be found speaking the Philadelphia region dialect, where the word \u201cJoisey\u201d is unheard of. And certainly, Barbara Sugarman, who is shown to have been raised in a semi-affluent middle-class environment, would not have been speaking such a thick brogue. When Hollywood gets it wrong, they go over the top, and they love to go with the cliches.\r My next objection is the subject matter of the film, which again, stresses the primitive, if not positively elemental, level of culture that is presumed to exist in the State of New Jersey. (Remember Darren Aronofsky's The Wrestler? Also, over the top with its depiction of working-class New Jersey.) Jon Martello is not only mindlessly promiscuous to the point where dogs in the street are more discriminating than he is, but he is addicted to pornography and prefers pornography to genuine relations with real women. He watches pornography relentlessly, masturbates fiendishly, and confesses everything to the priest at his local church, where he then dutifully recites the number of Hail Mary's and Lord's Prayers he has to say to atone for his sins. (The number usually varies with the number of times he watched porn movies or had sex out of wedlock.) Just when Martello and Sugarman are becoming almost unbearably tedious, a breath of fresh air arrives in the form of Esther (Julianne Moore), who proceeds to lend some dignity and depth to the scenario. She is a much older woman for Jon Martello, characterized by the grief that she experienced in her recent past, which makes her extremely open and emotionally vulnerable but with a unique charm, a sort of latter-day Annie Hall. She is easy-going and forgiving, but also a wellspring of wisdom, and it is only through a rather odd coupling with her that Martello becomes humanized and stops acting like a beast gone mad in the woodlands.\r Moore almost saves the film, but the cartoonish characterizations that precede her entrance unfortunately predominate. Director/screenwriter Gordon-Levitt is still young, and he will have to work a little harder to do a truly sensitive film the next time around."

It plays out like a very average story, but the content is important to young men (and women) and it is clear that it has been given serious thought. The ending took me by surprise and added a new dimension to the film which makes me want to see it in again from that perspective. It has something to say about relationships."

      "text": "JGL\u2019s director debut (also the writer and leading actor, a triple threat indeed in this case), DON JON, like (500) DAYS OF SUMMER (2009, 8/10), they are not your average rom-com and they are much better since they underpin certain realistic meanings. For DON JON, it is an anti-objectification to what Hollywood chronically implants into our generations\u2019 minds about the veneer of romantic relationship. That is, man is looking for the perfect sex target to fulfill all his fantasies and woman is looking for a Mr. Perfect who is totally under her control. Both reek one-sided selfishness.\r Thanks to the invention of internet pornography and the discrepancy between man and woman on playing with oneself, for man, the more graphically related sexual demand can be easily actualized, so our protagonist Jon (Gordon-Levitt) is a porno-addicted gym jock, who has no difficulty hooking up the hottest girl in the nightclub, but when the eventual boy-meet-girl scenario happens, a smoking hot Barbara (Johansson) yet cannot drag him out to the cold turkey period, meanwhile, Barbara is far from picture-perfect and clearly has her own agenda of what kind of man she is seeking for, an inexorable clash sets them apart (although the history in the browser is a shoddy device). Later on, Jon starts to date an elder woman Esther (Moore) from the night school, who has just gone through a tragic accident in her life, nurtured by Esther\u2019s sensible edification, Jon becomes clarified about what love is and accomplishes his rite of passage.\r DON JON is a genre-blender with indie comedy, romp romance and lighthearted drama, adorned by formulaic default of male chauvinism, female sexualization, boisterous Anglo-Italian family (Tony Danza is an embarrassing joke though), paint-by-number religious service and confession, while swarmed with repetition shots of making beds, gym, church, night school, sex-hunt in the club, and of course, porn stuff. Nevertheless as a novice in the director\u2019s chair, JGL shows qualified competence in executing the story with slick pace and earnest passion, and as an actor, he is definitely a leading man material among his peers. Johansson and Moore are pitch-perfect in two different types of women who turn a boy into a man. Johansson amplifies her self-mocking fatuousness and control freaky possessiveness, injects immense credibility in a derogative character; Moore, is an on-screen goddess of mettle, shatters the twenty-years age difference, generates some wholesome chemistry with JGL despite it is not a challenging role for her at all.\r I give DON JON an reassuring 8/10, it is more than a cute feel-good flick to watch with your significant other, underneath its less-than-impressive script, the connotation it evokes is worth more wider reverberations other than an immediate suggestion \u201cwhy not Jon just date a porn star if he is really into that?\u201d. For me, it is a guilty pleasure not the least because Moore is in it."

It has an honest heart and impeccable performances from all involved. In all seriousness, there's not a single weak performance from any of the cast. Without spoiling anything I can say that this is a strong directorial debut from an already established young actor that explores the sexual identity of a new generation that is often oversimplified. This film takes a turn in the end that's unexpected, but very gratifying. Absolutely a must see."

And then he randomly just re-introduced her at the end so abruptly... just not the most amazing movie I have seen in awhile. What is happening to Cinema?"

While some plot points in the story seem to get rushed, ultimately, the things that weren't connected dot to dot became realistically foretold. Levitt painted a beauty here that doesn't get convoluted or trip over it's own words. Whether you agree or disagree with the premise or conclusion, this is a well-crafted film and very much worth watching."

      "text": "Jon, in fondo, sarebbe un bravo ragazzo: sa tenere in ordine una casa, va a messa con regolarit\u00e0 confessandosi sempre (la sua accurata contabilit\u00e0 dei peccati gli costa penitenze che poi vengono scontate mentre fatica in palestra) e tutte le domeniche va a pranzo da mamm\u00e0, i maschi di casa a tavola in canottiera mentre il televisore trasmette a ciclo continuo football americano di cui suo padre  fanatico. Il problema  che il giovanotto  un egocentrico impenitente  in ci\u00f2 che ritiene importante c\u2019\u00e8 una sfilza di aggettivi possessivi  e, di conseguenza, nel rapporto con l\u2019altro sesso ha la sensibilit\u00e0 di un quindicenne carico di testosterone: cataloga le donne dando loro un voto,  un seduttore seriale (da cui il nomignolo \u2018Don\u2019), ma la sua vera passione resta il porno, giudicato sempre pi\u00f9 soddisfacente di qualsiasi rapporto reale. Quando incontra Barbara, la sua prospettiva parrebbe cambiare  e vorrei ben vedere, avendo lei le fattezze di Scarlett Johansson  tanto che si azzarda persino a presentarla in casa per la gioia di sua madre che non vede l\u2019ora di diventare nonna. Ben presto, per\u00f2, il meccanismo si inceppa, un po\u2019 perch\u00e9 lui non riesce a rinunciare al sesso virtuale, un po\u2019 perch\u00e9 lei  solo un\u2019altra faccia di un atteggiamento egoista verso la vita: Barbara cerca di plasmare Jon a suo piacimento  la scuola serale, il divieto di fare le pulizie, le pellicole sdolcinate a ripetizione (Anne Hathaway e Cuba Gooding jr. cammei dei film nel film)   finch\u00e8 la sorella di lui Monica non dice che il re  nudo nell\u2019unica battuta che le  riservata, visto che per il resto del tempo  impegnata con il telefonino. Le lezioni forzate hanno per\u00f2 avuto almeno il pregio di far conoscere a Jon la sua compagna di corso Esther, una Julianne Moore che pi\u00f9 lontana non potrebbe essere dai suoi ideali femminili: tra le braccia materne di questa vedova molto pi\u00f9 vecchia di lui  gli fa il bagno e occhio anche al cambio di prospettiva sul preservativo  egli fa infine un passo verso la maturit\u00e0, riuscendo per la prima volta a dare oltre che a ricevere. Per la sua prima regia, Joseph Gordon-Levitt scrive e dirige questa svelta (novanta minuti scarsi) commedia dal buon ritmo e puntellata da un pi\u00f9 che discreto numero di battute: pur essendo un californiano di origine ebrea, la ambienta curiosamente in una famiglia italoamericana cattolica, ma questa sua versione di giovane Scorsese con il sorriso funziona assai meglio di quanto ci si potesse aspettare. Il merito va equamente diviso tra una scrittura che mostra davvero pochi passaggi da limare e un cast che sembra divertirsi: Gordon-Levitt  sempre in scena, anche se all\u2019inizio non aveva pensato a se stesso come interprete, e attorno a lui gli altri attori riescono a caratterizzare con gusto i loro personaggi, compresi quelli minori come i genitori di Jon Tony Danza e Glenne Headly oppure gli amici tamarri come e pi\u00f9 di lui Rob Brown e Jeremy Luke. Certo, tutto questo parlare di (e fare) sesso pu\u00f2 dare fastidio a qualcuno, come  successo anche fra i sei che erano in sala con me durante la proiezione:  un peccato, per\u00f2, perch\u00e9 l\u2019argomento, pur scivoloso,  trattato cercando di evitare la volgarit\u00e0 e viene usato per rappresentare quell\u2019eccesso di autoreferenzialit\u00e0 che caratterizza molti individui nella nostra societ\u00e0. Il tutto, comunque, senza prendersi troppo sul serio e, soprattutto, evitando i moralismi: se da una parte lo sguardo sul piccolo mondo che ruota attorno a Jon poteva essere pi\u00f9 aggressivo, dall\u2019altro il \u2018lieto fine\u2019 conclusivo risulta ben lungi dall\u2019essere classico."

      "text": "Don Jon's first hour is recognisably on the money with regards to sex and the male of the species. Some very funny comedic writing hits some great targets often with the sting of truth. A buffed up Joseph Gordon-Levitt is great fun as catholic boy Jon, more interested in internet porn than in sustaining long term relationships with any girl, including Scarlett Johansson who is great here. In fact, she hasn't been this good in years and looks fantastic into the bargain.\rUnfortunately, with the entry of a rather mis-cast and de glamourised Julianne Moore the film rather deflates. It's obvious that she and Levitt will get together, but this last act which is a shade unbelievable loses the laughs, becomes rather moralising, somewhat judgemental and is actually too simplistically concluded. All of which is a shame because there is so much to enjoy in the film's first hour.\rAmongst its other achievements the movie boasts a great original score. Alternating between lush romanticism and a playful cheekiness it enhances all the shenanigans taking place on screen, perfectly."

As bad as the trailer.  JGL is not my cup of tea.  His acting/looks were cringeworthy most of the time.  We're supposed to believe this pencil neck, wife-beater wearing guy can pick up and draw attention of limitless hot women and easily turn them down for sex too.  Most of the characters are shallow and cliche.  Overacting at it's worst.  Characters not sympathetic.\r Girl picks guy up at a night club.  Guy immediately wants to **** her, she leaves.  Guy takes her to lunch says he wants to **** her.  Finally gets to **** her, but then she is appalled that he watches porn?  Makes him promise never to watch it again (year right!)...he lies...she breaks up with him over it....cmon.  A 10 yr old would have written garbage like that.  Characters were all unlikeable, other than the black friend and the Red head.  Not a very deep movie.  Not funny either (some claim it's comedy).  Tony Danza's character was annoying as ****  Maybe Jersey boys would relate to these douchebags.  I did not."
