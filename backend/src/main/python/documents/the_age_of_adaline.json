Adeline (played by Blake Lively) goes through an accident that changes her life, she loses her ability to age. She falls in love with a young Harrison Ford (Anthony Ingruber), and many years later, she falls in love with a young man (Micheal Huisman) who is the son of the young Harrsion Ford she loved many years ago. The movie is very smooth, and heart wrenching, Huisman and Lively knock it out of the park and Ford gives a serious role as well.

The Age Of Adeline is an excellent movie."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "The Age of Adaline is the classic example of a movie made by the wrong director.

But every genre has its gems and its rocks, and \"The Age of Adaline\", while it may not be a diamond, is a compelling film that allows just enough of the supernatural to keep it interesting.\rBlake Lively plays Adaline, a woman whom, through a car accident in the late 1930's, somehow after being struck by lightning in the car she's submerged in and revived, discovers that she doesn't age.    This explanation of how her body stops the aging process may or may not be pliable, but that's missing the point, mainly - just what would it be like to be in that situation.\rWithout giving too much away, the focus in this movie is her loneliness, which happens because she can't tell potential suitors what's wrong with her and doesn't want to watch them age while she stays young.   As luck would have it, she meets Ellis, played by Michael Huisman, starts to fall in love, and then, upon meeting his parents for the first time, re-acquaints herself with Ellis' father, who was also a suitor of hers in the 1960's and recognizes her.\rWe'll leave the plot there for now.    Overall, the movie is touching in places, a bit sad, and does serve to remind those of us chasing our immortality that it may not be all it's cracked up to be.    Harrison Ford, after spending a large portion of his career as wooden tough guys, has shown a tremendous improvement in movies where he acts for roles his age, including Branch Ricky, the legendary baseball coach in \"1947\" and as the father/former boyfriend in \"The Age of Adaline\".    His acting is moving, emotional and perfect for this role.\rHats off also to Anthony Ingruber, who plays the young Harrison Ford character, and while physically not being a dead ringer, his voice and mannerisms are eerily close.    \"The Age of Adaline\" is a good movie, perhaps not a great movie, but will not disappoint."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Age Of Adaline is not as focused as the character itself; it is a gimmick; might roleplay as a love story, and on the other hand, it seems like a Time-Travel/Epic Fantasy/Period Peace (which is how this film is advertised).

The film explores two sides of the coin: Yes, it's great to be beautiful, young and biologically immortal, and thus to experience all the world has to offer, becoming rich in the process (e.g., investing in Xerox in 1950, because time's on her side).

Ridiculous.\rHarrison Ford is probably the only bright spot here, he delivers an emotional performance.\rAll the other characters fade in and out, depending on what attachment Blake Lively has to them.\rAlso, both instances of her dying/age stopping/rebirth happen due to car crashes. You would think after the first time, she would be more careful (or even after living for so long with cars) about distracted driving, but alas, afraid not.

I\u2019m not sure so sure. From the day I saw the first footage I knew that this Lee Toland Krieger directed film had the potential to be special. The cast among which Harrison Ford, Kathy Baker, Ellen Burstyn & Michiel Huisman helped in raising the bar of the level of acting to be expected. I know didn\u2019t mention Blake Lively but if I\u2019m honest her name did little to peak my interest in this film.\r Despite the fact that The Age of Adaline sounds like a syrupy romantic movie, it has its charms. The film is a straight up romance but it has all these interesting elements, such as the fantasy of eternal youth, the \u201cscience\u201d behind her condition, but also the philosophical questions this movie conjures up that makes it a good cinematic experience.\r The film is so subtle and measured that the story is easy to believe and get into. Blake Lively may not have been a draw for me but she did a hell of good job in portraying the young-looking old woman that is Adaline. Ellen Burstyn & Harrison Ford were, as expected, totally convincing in their roles. I bought their relationship to Adaline in the film, I did not question it I just reveled in the beauty of their performances. Michiel Huisman is steadily coming up in this world and this another performance that will bring him on step closer to become the A-lister he could be.\r The story and the performances in the film made it a remarkable film but cinematography & the production design really helped the movie. It gave the movie a timeless aspect, as if it was made a few years back while looking fresh and brand new. It was subtle yet noticeable, in other word they did an amazing job.\r The Age of Adaline is more than your average romance, it makes you dream, question but more importantly it entertains.\r By @wornoutspines"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "One of my all time favorite Blake lively movies, she is an amazing actress."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I have watched this movie four times given my interest in the subject matter, and it reveals itself more lavishly, cleverly and poignantly each time.

Think of The Notebook combined with the TV show, Forever, and you get the idea. The surprise at the very very end was obvious several scenes earlier, but what can you do. And the complications that really would have occurred given the social circumstances as they were at the end of the movie are passed over in favor of a tidy conclusion. But that's Hollywood. One pleasure of this film was how well Harrison Ford looked and acted. He appeared younger than he has in some other recent movies. Sometimes he's brilliant, as in Indiana Jones. Sometimes he's very good as in Witness, and sometimes he falls totally flat as he did in What Lies Beneath or Expendables 3. Luckily here he does a great job. And the guy who portrays Ford's character as a young man was eerily spot on. The entire cast came across as comfortable with each other in a way that's rare in films.

For every action in the movie they explained it very clearly, that's the indication of the involvement of the science, but mostly bogus for the present era. So that is where fantasy steps in.\r A beautiful concept with the wonderful cast. And again they did not make full use of it, lacked a deep exploration into the theme they have created for this movie. Blake Lively solely handled the movie and none others were up to the expectation, expect Harrison Ford in his about 5% of the screen presence.\r Like most of the guys, I am displeased with the ending. Till then I was enjoying the film, but later it ruined my mood. Because humans are always desiring for things which are out of his league and I'm human too. Since I'm not Adaline I was rooting her and I was disappointed once the twist at the end came. Later I accepted that, because it was a perfect conclusion regarding whatever I wanted.\r In an entertainment movie, sometime we won't care about what's good and bad, but need some good pleasure for the time we spend for it. Especially in this kind of theme, which are out of reality, we usually love a happy ending. Because families want to leave the cinema hall with a good mood as it is indeed targeted for family audiences.

Age of Adaline is a fun idea with a talented cast that's hindered only by odd narrative choices, both in story and in spoken form, that force too much scientific explanation into what's happening to her.  Without spoiling any major parts of the plot, I think the story would have been better served with a more impactful ending, instead of the more upbeat one found.  The pacing was also of some concern for me - too often I asked my friends \"how far are we into this movie?\", because it felt longer than it really was.

Anchored by a career changing performance, Blake Lively breathes life over and over into Adaline. It\u2019s a ride worthy of the years Adaline lives in immortality."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Armed with narration that makes it sound like a mystery show about a vicious murder on the Investigation Discovery channel, The Age of Adaline is a romantic fantasy film about the Curious Case of Adaline Bowman (Blake Lively). Living an average, if unextraordinary, life initially, Adaline's existence is throw into disarray one night. After the death of her husband, she is driving to meet her parents who have her daughter Fleming with them to spend the weekend. However, after a rare California snow dusting, the slick roads lead to her getting into a car accident. Nearing death, she is shocked back to life by a lightning bolt that hits the water she is submerged in and, unbeknownst to her, it changes her life forever. From that day on, she stops aging. What unfolds is a film that may not be revolutionary, but is nonetheless an interesting concept realized in a minor chick flick fashion that manages to still be interesting, but too focused on being cute to really delve too deep into its questions.Ignoring the fact that poor Adaline is an awful driver and that defibrilators/lighting do not have that kind of impact on a person, The Age of Adaline is nonetheless a compelling film. Introducing the fact that she is now set to live forever, the film smartly shows the good with the bad. Given all the time in the world, she can slowly grow her investment portfolio, accumulate knowledge about various world events, and learn many different languages. Constantly moving and getting new identities to hide from those who would want to study her, Adaline also gets the rare chance to live many different lives and to see a variety of places throughout the world, though her heart is always in San Francisco. Being able to live forever, if one is willing to accept the bad, can be an enlightening experience that has allowed Adaline to have a ringside seat to history for the entirety of her life.However, the bad is very bad. Having to disconnect from emotion in its entirety, Adaline only allows herself two things: her daughter Fleming (Ellen Burstyn) and her dog. Unfortunately, when that dog dies, she is forced to once again confront the fact that everybody else is mortal and she is cursed with immortality. Pushing away men who would fill the void in her life quite gladly, Adaline's existence may be one that is knowledge-filled, but it is empty. She has been forced to box her emotions away in order to avoid feeling hurt over-and-over again whenever somebody she loved passed away. At a certain point, watching the men and animals you love constantly die becomes depressing and opening your heart to another love becomes something to actively avoid out of fear of letting your heart get broken yet again. While the film never really goes beyond the horror of living forever being found in constantly losing those that you love (plus the inevitability of Fleming's death), it remains a compelling issue that the film smartly focuses upon. In introducing one of her old love interests, William (Harrison Ford), the added wrinkle of telling William that Adaline is dead (she was going under the alias of Jenny, claiming that Adaline was her mother) is an interesting one. With Ford turning in a very good performance, he allows us to see the pain on his face when he learns that Adaline died, both the solemn realization that he is getting old and the knowledge that what he had with her is gone forever without any hope. In a way, this is the film's method of telling the audience that avoiding heartbreak is impossible. Instead, it is a part of life whether you age or not. However, at the very least, William's aging has allowed him to find a woman he loves in place of Adaline and not be forced to watch her, or anyone else's, life from the outside looking in to avoid being hurt. It has allowed him to live, have regrets, look to the past fondly, and look to the future with equal fondness. For Adaline, however, she has regrets, but has no life out of fear of the future and out of pain dominating the past.However, through its constantly obtrusive narrator that just spits out exposition at an unrelenting pace, The Age of Adaline feels afraid to really explore its possibly complex and moving themes. Instead, it opts to sanitize it and bring it down to wide-ranging accessibility. In the process, it opts to go for quick grabs at pathos - dead dog - and not developing its supporting characters beyond the very bare minimum. As a result, the film winds up feeling rather sterilized. While director Lee Toland Krieger may have wanted to explore deeper ideas, this is not the script or the film where that as possible with the narration and general \"playing-it-safe\" nature of the film really undermining its heady themes."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "First I guess I have to mention the narration. I'll never understand why movies have unnecessary narration that is only good for killing the mood. It's hard to enjoy a film when it just spoon feeds you things.

We don't see her grow as a character, change through the times or have anything that makes her interesting.
