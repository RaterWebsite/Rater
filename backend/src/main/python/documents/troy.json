  "description": "In year 1250 B.C. during the late Bronze age, two emerging nations begin to clash. Paris, the Trojan prince, convinces Helen, Queen of Sparta, to leave her husband Menelaus, and sail with him back to Troy. After Menelaus finds out that his wife was taken by the Trojans, he asks his brother Agamemnom to help him get her back. Agamemnon sees this as an opportunity for power. So they set off with 1,000 ships holding 50,000 Greeks to Troy. With the help of Achilles, the Greeks are able to fight the never before defeated Trojans.",

      "text": "\"Troy\" is a terrific piece of entertainment.  When it opened, I'll admit, my companion and I went solely to heap derision and abuse on it but we walked out smiling.  It's pseudo-scholars, not scholars, who whine about deviations from Homer; scholars know that the Troy material has always been altered and adapted by artists, whether by ancient Greek dramatists, medieval poets, or modern historical novelists.  I actually found the film acceptably Homeric, treating the Iliad's main conflict (Agamemnon's insult to Achilles and the resulting disasters), as well as many of its themes, (honor and dishonor in war, e.g.) and strategies (compression, e.g.).  And the decision to take the gods out of the action was a good one; no filmmaker yet has managed to make them look anything but silly.  The biggest surprise in the film is Brad Pitt's Achilles, which I expected to deplore and actually rather liked.  He combines preternatural power and grace, pride, contempt and melancholy into a coherent whole, and, aside from wishing him genuinely berserk (not just p*ssed off) when he goes after Hector, I was impressed.  The film has a lot of smart casting, especially Peter O'Toole, whose dignified, suffering Priam makes the fall of Troy searing, Brian Cox, his greedy, unprincipled counterpart on the Greek side, and Orlando Bloom as Paris (though it was hard to watch Bloom shoot arrows at human, rather than elf, speed).  The only real weak spot is Diane Kruger's insipid Helen, but no actress has yet managed to convince as \"the face that launched a thousand ships,\" and, yes, I'm including Elizabeth Taylor.  They need an Aishwarya Rai: now there's a woman to start a war over.  I also grew weary of self-reflexive portent in the dialogue (\"They'll be talking about this war and the heroes who fought in it for thousands of years\").    But the film has many more strengths, including naval and battle choreography, sets, costumes, and the infamous Trojan Horse, which was perfect."

And his fight against Hector is one of the best fight scenes I have ever seen. All the actors in this movie did a great job. This story was good based on history and myth.

While there are some slightly cheesy moments, and I have been told it barely follows the poem it was based off of, the movie manages to create it's own enthralling narrative, and remains gripping from start to finish. This movie's use of music, special effects, and set peaces conveys this sense of scale which many films fail to produce, with all of this Hollywood spectacle however, this movie still has substance. Amidst it's immense run time, no scene is gratuitous, and most the viewer can understand and follow most characters personalities and motives pretty easily. But more importantly the movie raises several interesting moral questions, ranging from the meaning of war, to the importance of one's legacy. The only real issue I have with this movie are that sometimes Brad Pitt's performance is a little wooden, and many scenes which were supposed to be emotionally impactful, I found to be lacking in the sentimental value necessary to really get a reaction. Also, while the film's double narrative was generally well put together, it kind of snubbed certain main characters throughout the second act."

But despite all that (and some other things that I didn't mention), the core story - Homer's story, altered as it is - is so strong, that it carries the movie effortlessly through all its considerable length. The plot is flowing, the characters are recognizable and actions have consequences - that, for me is the best achievement of this movie. That, and Brad Pitt - maybe I'm a little biased, because I had a crush on Achilles since I was 11, but i thought that Pitt was brilliant in the part. The vanity, the tenderness, the arrogance, the mood swings - it was all there for all to see. Poor doomed golden boy... sniff. All the others were adequate to good, with 2 aforementioned exceptions. Good movie, which for all its glamour, does provide a cirious meditations on human condition: actions have consequences. Men a wretched things. On every war, you kill your brothers, and it will never end."

      "text": "A lot of people are foggy enough about the battle of Troy\u2019s origins to confuse the story laid out in the \u201cIliad\u201d with history. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll hear more than one movie-goer comment on the film\u2019s historical accuracy. Last night I heard at least two. But, like Hidalgo, The Passion, or maybe more like Harry Potter, Troy is another ambitious adaptation that only manages as solid entertainment. The idea of taking Homer\u2019s battle poem and turning it into a movie is a good one, since it instantly leans towards the epic and contains plenty of notable and screen worthy characters. It\u2019s also a story strongly ingrained in our cultural consciousness, after centuries of required classroom reading. It has already received some comparison to Gladiator, but where that movie was a surely modern fighting flick, the story of Troy lends itself much more to Hollywood\u2019s golden age, the sort of thing that would have attracted a younger Chuck Heston. As Achilles, Brad Pitt is either naked or fighting. There\u2019s no in between. Achilles is a guy who only wears clothes when he\u2019s killing. I'm not sure what that says about his character. But don\u2019t worry guys, it isn\u2019t real Pitt nudity, just side-nudity. In fact, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen so much side-nudity in any film. I now know every intimate inch of Brad Pitt\u2019s naked profile. Troy lacks the courage to show full frontal or even a little bit of ass crack. Odd for any other R-rated movie, but not really for this one which only barelyshows enough carnage to warrant a rated R. It could easily have slipped by as PG-13 and one has to wonder why they bothered at all with an R when the removal of even a thimble-full of blood could have garnered them something lesser. If you\u2019re going to go R, make it worthwhile. Don\u2019t be afraid of women\u2019s breasts. Don\u2019t run away from realistic battle sequences. Hey, throw in a couple of decapitations! This is war, not West Side Story. What the film\u2019s massive battle sequences sometimes lack in ugly realism is made only worse by Director Wolfgang Petersen\u2019s strange propensity to focus in on one on one battles to the exclusion of all else. A hundred-thousand men clash on the field of battle, yet everything falls silent as soldiers form a big school-yard huddle whenever Hector picks up his sword. Should he dispatch a particularly difficult foe, he mutters \u201cthat\u2019s enough\u201d and all one-hundred thousand men just seem to wander home. Maybe I\u2019ve been permanently spoiled by Peter Jackson\u2019s groundbreaking siege in The Two Towers, but Troy\u2019s bigger and supposedly badder battles just can\u2019t compare. Troy fails to garner any excitement from its massive scale, but Petersen does have an amazing gift for filming one on one action. The final big battle between Achilles and Hector is engrossing and amazing. That\u2019s due in no small part to both Pitt and Bana\u2019s impressive performances, in which both brilliantly capture the physicality of their respective characters. Still, it is impossible to walk away from Troy completely unsatisfied. Despite some major directing flaws, Petersen does deliver an enjoyably huge (if a little too long) period adventure. Women will no doubt swoon at the legions of male characters clad in thigh revealing leather costumes. Men will go insane over Achilles kicking ass against anything and everything that moves. Troy is big, grandiose, and entertaining. With such a marvelous cast, I wish Petersen had delivered a masterpiece, but I\u2019ll settle for some solid sandal-wearing fun."

      "text": "The legendary Achilles goes to battle with the Trojans in Wolfgang Petersen's interpretation of 'Troy', loosely based on the story of \"Ilaid\". Brad Pitt possesses the role of the legendary Achilles, who is often seen as the greatest warrior. It seems that he has had some quarrels with King Agamemnon (Brian Cox), the King often feels concerned over Achilles devil-may-care behavior, and his lack of respect for the king bothers himself. Meanwhile, we see two brothers, Prince Hector (Eric Bana) and his younger brother, Paris (Orlando Bloom) negotiating a peace treaty with Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson). But all that peace fades away when Paris is having a secret affair with Menelaus' wife, Helen (Diane Kruger). When Paris informs Hector about this, Hector feels angry and worried that a war is about to come... and that Menelaus will stop at nothing to make Paris suffer to get his wife back. Upon discovering his missing wife, Menelaus turns to his brother, Agamemnon for help. Agamemnon sees this as an opportunity to go to war, and must put all his trust in the talented Achilles to make sure that the war can be easily won. Back at Troy, King Priam (Peter O'Toole) feels concerned when Paris introduces him to Helen, worried that if he is to send her back, Paris would follow her and get killed. He reluctantly decides to let her stay and let events unfold however they can. While the production design of this movie is fascinating, the actors seem to fit the roles that they are cast in - Brad Pitt has the physique for Achilles, Orlando Bloom works as the heart-strung Paris, and Diane Kruger's beauty works for the beauty of Helen - and not forgetting the crafting of the action, it seems that the movie fails to deliver in terms of drama. There is no emotional uphold, no sign of intensity, and no urgency either. It all feels like a typical Hollywood take on one of the greatest legend stories of all time. It's lavish, it's beautiful and it's grand, but underneath all of that lies something somewhat bland. It's not a bad movie, just not a great one. Maybe if the actors were given a chance to act instead of appearing as attractive as possible, it would have worked, and maybe if the dialogue contained more plausibility, it would seem less unintentionally hilarious. Overall, 'Troy' is entertaining, but not gripping."

      "text": "A great epic with a confused script.This film is an adaptation of Greek myths and legends surrounding the war between Greeks and Trojans. According to legend, Troy was besieged for ten years and only fell when the Greeks deceived them with a wooden horse. The film also tells the mith of Achilles. Directed by Wolfgang Petersen, this epic film has screenplay by David Beniof based on Homer's Iliad, and a good cast with the participation of Brad Pitt (as Achilles), Eric Bana (as Hector), Orlando Bloom (as Paris), Diane Kruger ( as Helen), Brian Cox (as Agamemnon, the Greek king), Brendan Gleeson (as Menelaus, the Spartan king) and Peter O'Toole (as Priam, the Trojan king).This type of epics, whether mythological or biblical, has an important feature: the whole script, scenery and costumes must be carefully written and planned because the audience knows the story beforehand and is waiting for something consistent with what she know. And this film managed to comply with this feature, although its too far from Homer at various moments. Visually, the film is excellent, with great costumes, scenery, photography, sound and visual effects. Some of the performances also surprised by the depth and drama, like Peter O'Toole in the role of Priam. Brad Pitt also performed very well, although his character doesn't leave room for him to show all his talent.The big problem of this movie is the script, which tries to mix various Greek myths with the story of Homer's Iliad, ending up lost and confused by too much information. Consequently, there are characters in the film that have great relevance but hardly appear in the myth (Briseis and Patroclus for example), whereas other characters that mythology values \u200b\u200bwill end up virtually disappeared in the film (Cassandra and Ulysses are obvious examples). Another \"victim\" of this poorly thought out script was Achilles, a central character in the film, beautifully played by Pitt but a shadow of mythological Achilles, which has a much greater depth and psychological wealth, something that the script didn't know or didn't want to explore. I'm sure that Brad Pitt would have been up to the challenge if writer had followed that path. Unfortunately, he chose to value other things, almost creating sub-plots that then kills at birth by not giving them continuity. There are also characters and situations that arise and only those who know the Greek mythology understand why, because the film doesn't give them any explanation or follow-up. For example, the sudden and momentary appearance of Aeneas at the end of the movie... only who knows the mythology will know that Aeneas is one of the names associated with the founding of Rome.This movie is a good movie, with good actors and a good story. It would be an even better movie if script was better but, nevertheless, worth seeing it."

E gente... o desenvolvimento do mesmo me d\u00e1 vergonha alheia. Primeiro temos a for\u00e7a\u00e7\u00e3o de barra quanto a ele. Todo mundo \"pagando pau\", o exaltando - at\u00e9 mesmo o pr\u00f3prio Rei, sendo que o personagem j\u00e1 cuspiu na cara dele em diversos momentos. Toda quest\u00e3o do seu proposito, no dialogo com sua m\u00e3o, s\u00e3o contradit\u00f3rios ao ponto de vista que ele tem ao ser questionado sobre a guerra. A sua rela\u00e7\u00e3o com a Briseis \u00e9 perigosa e abre mais uma vez a porta para s\u00edndrome de Estocolmo. O figurino do personagem n\u00e3o me agradou. \u00c9 como se o Brad Pitt n\u00e3o pertencesse aquele universo, muito menos intimidasse seus inimigos. O fato de que o Rei n\u00e3o o matou n\u00e3o me desce de jeito nenhum. O seu \"amor\" pela briseis muito menos.Os combates s\u00e3o legais, assim como as batalhas em longa escala. O duelo entre Aquiles e Heitor foi muito bem coreografado. A OST cumpre seu proposito e a fotografia tamb\u00e9m - se atentando ao g\u00eanero.Sean Bean estava bem no filme. Eric Bana tamb\u00e9m chamou minha aten\u00e7\u00e3o, mesmo sendo limitado em alguns momentos."

      "text": "I can't even think of the amount of money spinning around this movie. Famous director, a lot of famous actors, a bunch of extras and special effects. The original artwork is quite respected even if the atmosphere of greek tragedies doesn't match at all with all these american eyes and brains.Brad Pitt's acting is terrible: he always has this kind of angry and dumb face even when he is sorry. I can only salute him for his ability to perform martial choregraphies. He however managed to reduce the overall epicness tone of the movie by attenuating the intensity of the events.It is really hard to have empathy for any of the characters excepted for Priam, Hector and his wife because the others all look like pre-programmed robots. It is not because your story is written that you have to play it like robots come on."
