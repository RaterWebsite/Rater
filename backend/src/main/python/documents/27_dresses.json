But let me say this, it was not as cheesy or stupid as it could have been. It felt semi-realistic. And more importantly, it made me laugh. Oh yea, and we were glad she ended up with the much cuter journalist."

Strangely both featured an actor / actress from Grey's Anatomy. Apparently having left the safe confines of Seattle Grace, Katherine Heigl is neither as sweet nor as charming as she is on the show. I felt that her character wasn't innocent enough to warrant the sympathy, nor was she sarcastic enough to be funny. The ending was clever, but the rest of the plot was only middling at best. Watch only if your strapped onto a chair for a intercontinental flight, and all other options are exhausted."

My initial impressions of the movie turned out to be correct (mainly the predictability), but I was surprised by the fact that I ended up somewhat enjoying the movie. Though my opinion of the movie is probably augmented due to the fact that the last movie I saw before it was One Missed Call (ugh)."

Although both Heigl and co-star James Marden were enjoyable, I felt that this movie was too predictable. Everything happened just as one would have suspected. Loved the stars, not so much the plotline."

Not only was Heigl's character annoying, the actor who plays her best friend has played the best friend role so many times, she's literally unwatchable. I would not even recommend this film as a DVD film to watch, not even if it was on TV for free."

Predictable, yes....a sweet love story usually means someone will fall in love....but then again we all know what's going to happen in a slasher movie or a end of the world saga. Katherine ROCKS!"

      "text": "\"27 Dresses\", for one tantalizing moment, gets nasty, gets mean; it tampers with the romantic/comedy formula, and gets real. At a bridal shower, the sibling rivalry between both sisters reaches its apex when Jane(Katherine Heigl) humiliates Tess(Malin Akerman) with a vengeance that's cathartic for moviegoers who've sat through too many predictable romantic/comedies such as \"27 Dresses\". If this movie about a perpetual bridesmaid had the conviction to aggravate Jane's festering wound rather than fix it up with a salve, \"27 Dresses\" would've been an unqualified artistic success, a triumph of art over commerce. But alas, Tess behaves contritely towards her big sis after their public implosion that's antithetical to her self-absorbed persona. \"27 Dresses\" bends, but doesn't break genre expectations. It's disappointing. It's dishonest. And the audience won't buy it. \"27 Dresses\" is a prime example of how focus groups can destroy the artistic integrity of a film. They say that a zebra doesn't change its stripes, except...in movies. Isn't liking the protagonist enough. Heigl is wonderful in her first star-vehicle? Do we have to like Tess, too?"

Katherine Heigl was luminous and - although swallowing the idea of someone as beautiful and intelligent as her as a dowdy wallflower is almost impossible - almost believable. James Marsden's charm made his character likable despite everything. Despite the cliches, I still had a good time watching."

I've lost patience watching the bubblegum chickflix and shows I've experienced in our relationship. Sadly, she doesn't understand how or why I don't want to watch them with her.As annoying as Heigl can be, she is good in this genre and plays the selfless, meek sister who finds her voice 17 minutes before the film ends perfectly.  Malin Ackerman is the consolation for the men dragged to this film - but we all know we'd rather see her as the Silk Spectre."

Anyone who gave this a bad reviews obviously doesn't like rom-coms.  It is filled to the brim with cliches and I imagine that most people can predict the entire plot of the film within the first twenty minutes.  Despite this, I like romantic comedies.  They are brainless, fun and pass the time.  As they go, this is the perfect rom-com;  it was well written, has an adorable ending and has two or three particularly funny gags.  I'm not saying this film is amazing, because it's not;  there are plenty of moments where there are no good jokes and it could easily be funnier with a better script.  What I'm saying is that if a person likes chick-flicks/ rom-coms, they will almost certainly enjoy this film."

      "text": "It's not easy to be a beauty and a funny girl \u2014 a va-va-voom body tends to distract from the jokes. But Katherine Heigl has the knack \u2014 look at Knocked Up. Just don't look here. Heigl fights an uphill battle in 27 Dresses, a chick-flick compendium of wedding cliches that will have every guy bolting for the exits. Screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna also wrote The Devil Wears Prada, but she's dipped her sharp wit in sentimental syrup. It helps to have Judy Greer around as Heigl's acid-tongued BFF. But McKenna and director Anne Fletcher (Step Up) make a fatal error. They want us to believe that the gorgeous Heigl is a plain Jane who saves her bridesmaid dresses \u2014 all twenty-seven of them \u2014 while stoking her unrequited love for her macho boss (Ed Burns). Not buying it. Even James Marsden, so good in Enchanted and Hairspray, can't put any zip into the role of a cynical wedding columnist who morphs unpersuasively into our girl's Prince Charming. 27 Dresses is so flimsy it gives froth a bad name."
