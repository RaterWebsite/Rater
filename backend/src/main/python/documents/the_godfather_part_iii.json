Coppola got away pretty much with not recasting Brando or Richard Castellano (\"Clemenza\") in GF, but those avoidable failures did not mean he could just skip Robert Duvall in III to save a few more bucks.  The first scenes didn't work for me, and Diane Keaton's Bronze-ish angered-wife costume looked bad.\r Inadequate performances were by goofy Eli Wallach, wooden George Hamilton, the guy playing Tom Hagen's son, even Mantegna, and Cuban-American Andy Garcia didn't quite pull off the Italian thing.  Much-criticized Sophia C. was okay to me, but many people couldn't deal with it.\r The Church mumbo jumbo was for the birds.  And this guy is worth a billion dollars or so and he lives in a sub-average suburban little house?  The helicopter attack on a conference room was completely ridiculous - nothing in any way like that happened in the whole history of the mafia..

Coppola's on video asking if the Don's heart betrayed him, didn't protect him?  Heart smart for Chrissake, this is supposed to be a gangster movie!  The old Michael and this Michael don't even seem to be relatives.\r I am reminded of a line from Barton Fink where the studio boss get's angry at the misguided director:  \"We don't put Wally Beery in some fruity movie about a guy wrestling with his soul!\"  Similarly, Paramount Pictures don't put some fruity movie about a guy wrestling with his soul in the Godfather franchise!

As the slavishly-awaited sequel to two of the finest films of the last 30 years, however, as the third episode in what may well be the Greatest Movie Story Ever Told, The Godfather Part III is, frankly, a dreadful disappointment.\r It is, perhaps, unfair that this new production should be so smothered under the reputation of two films made nearly 20 years ago. By so closely adhering to the exact structure of his previous two instalments, however, and through his liberal employment of flashbacks, Coppola himself seems to beg for the comparisons, making it abundantly clear throughout that what is on offer here is no new departure, but simply part three of that old familiar tale of the familia Corleone. And as such, it simply doesn't work, lacking the strength of narrative, the menace, the sheer epic sweep of all that has gone before.\r For about the first 30 minutes, however, everything seems to be very much in order. The familiar strains of Nino Rota's theme music never fail to send a shiver, the introduction of Andy Garcia as the suitably hotheaded bastard son of Sonny is a welcome addition to the ranks, while Pacino, all grey and shrunk, immediately conveys a telling portrait of immense power and obscene wealth, made all the more impressive by its confinement within such a wizened old frame.\r The first hint that we may be going slightly off the rails comes with the gathering of the clans and the subsequent Die Hard-style interruption from the skies, a badly-handled set piece more reminiscent of Bond than the beautifully understated brutality of the tollbooth.\r From here on, the violence becomes increasingly cartoon, notably Garcia riding a horse through the inevitable street festival, while things go from bad to worse as it gradually becomes all too apparent just how far out of her depth Sofia Coppola really is, floundering helplessly in her vain attempts to convince as both the Garcia love interest and daughter of the Don. By the time the much-vaunted operatic climax comes along, it is hardly surprising that proceedings finally slip into near-farce, as the supposed top assassin in all of Sicily takes a good half-hour and a fair portion of Cavalleria Rusticana to line up his sights. Miss Sofia manages to provoke the giggles amidst such supposed tragedy and all that is left is a basic re-run of your actual Don Corelone coil-shuffling routine to round things off.\r Fans of the first two instalments are likely to find The Godfather Part III an unworthy heir to the tradition. First-time voters, meanwhile, will surely wonder what on earth all the fuss was all about.\r Fans of the first two instalments are likely to find The Godfather Part III an unworthy heir to the tradition.

At the center of the story we have an older, more sympathetic Michael Corleone - now a respectable, rich businessman and philanthropist who is trying to reunite his family and make amends - but his mafia past keeps reaching out and dragging him back in.  He begins grooming his illegitimate nephew (Andy Garcia) for a leadership role, and this hothead gets a romance going with Michael's daughter (his first cousin - yuk - in a part played by the director's daughter).  A lot of the story involves the Catholic church and Michael's involvement in their finances - this was obviously based on a scandal that took place in the 1980s.  Maybe I'm too much of a stickler for realism, but I never understood the financial picture or who was screwing who out of what.  This should have been about the fall of the Corleones if it was to be a real \"rise and fall of...\" story, but they never really fall.  Instead there is a wild series of murders at the end, intercut with an Italian opera taking place on a stage (referring to the similar sequences in the first two movies), but the logic of it was never clear to me."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Get a grip you lot - it's only a movie.

While it still ranks as a great film, it lacks the emotional intensity of the first two films. The earlier two movies had incredibly well-acted and engrossing supporting characters like Fredo. Godfather Part 3 with Sofia Coppola, Joe Mantegna, and George Hamilton (while none of them were bad) just do not measure up to the quality of the first two movies."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "This film follows the story of \"The Godfather,\" which chronicles the journey of the Corleone family through the violent world of organized crime. In this film, an elderly Michael Corleone lives haunted by the crimes he committed and looking desperately, but unsuccessfully, to clean his family of any taint through its legitimation and links to the Vatican.Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, based on the novels of Mario Puzo, who collaborated in the writing of the script, it kept most of the cast of the previous films, made in the seventies, and bring new and important characters. The soundtrack goes from Nino Rota to Carmine Coppola, father of director and Talia Shire, actress who also enters this film. It didn't won any Academy Award but was nominated for seven statuettes.More than fifteen years after \"The Godfather II\", this film is, almost, the black sheep of the \"family\". Criticized, misunderstood, even somewhat ridiculed, will always live in the shadow of the two films that preceded it, and which are undoubtedly two giants of cinema. And if we want to compare them, this is the loser because it can no longer surprise us, despite maintaining excellent action scenes and a Michael Corleone much more paternalistic, living threatened by his ghosts (in particular his brother, which is a very smart way to explore the cruelest act of the criminal life of this mobster). I didn't quite understand his position on the daughter's romance with Vincent, her cousin. The connection to the Catholic Church also seemed a bit forced, as if it had been snapped on in the script. Al Pacino has remained up to the challenge and managed to perfectly display the psychological contradictions of his character. Andy Garcia also had a great performance and Joe Mantegna can say that this, probably, it was the best performance he did. This is a film that is worth seeing, mostly if we didn't compare it to the previous two films."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Infelizmente, n\u00e3o conseguiu superar seu antecessor. aqui, vemos mudan\u00e7as absurdas nos personagens. n\u00e3o a nenhum problema aqui com isso. mas...nao me agradou muito. eu esperava uma conclusao epica. nao e ruim, e bom eu gostei. mas, faltou uma coisa, varias coisas. elementos importantes que precisavam estar aqui presente."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Many of the reviews of this seem too positive. The movie was deeply flawed and love for the early Godfather films should not blind us to the fiasco that was number 3.Casting problems: Diane Keaton said all she needed to say in part 2. Her presence in the part 3 added nothing whatsoever. We learn from her dialog that she will always love Michael but that she will never accept his gangster ways. Yeah. We learned that in part 2. George Hamilton as the lawyer/confident. Lame. Sophia Coppola as Mary. She comes across like a dull-witted 16-year-old that doesn't know a thing about acting but thinks it is fun to be able to stand in front of a camera. (spoiler alert) the primary dramatic event of the movie involved her death. By that time I was hoping that she would be killed off (or at least get no more screen time), so my ability to feel any emotional impact at the death of this air-headed monstrosity.Dialog problems: The dialog in Michael's study in the initial scene is painful to hear. The movie gets better, but very awkward dialog pops up every 20 minutes or so throughout the movie. Part of the problem is the screen play and part of the problem is that at times the actors don't know how to effectively deliver their lines.Plot problems: Awkward casting & dialog aside, I think this is the biggest problem. when you get to be one of the wealthiest business men in the world, wacking people no longer makes any sense. When you have untold millions at your disposal, you find that you a wide range of tools to accomplish your aims, and most of these tools work better than bullets (anyone remember the last time a Fortune 500 CEO was taken out in a mob hit?). (spoiler alert) There is a scene in which one of the baddies flies a helicopter outside a penthouse ballroom in a high rise building and then occupants of the helicopter riddle the ballroom with machine gun fire killing dozens of wealthy business men. This would be par for the course in the Matrix, or True Lies, or Commando, but this type of violence is not part of the real world we live in. It's cartoonishness is at odds with the other Godfather films and makes it difficult to take this film seriously. As well paced and tense as the final opera house scene was, it was also in the category of cartooney violence. Did the best assassin in all of Italy really think the cleverest way to kill one of the richest men on the planet was to slip into a well guarded public place, kill off a bunch of hired body guards and then shoot a man in front of 1000 witnesses? Well, I guess the screenwriter thought so. The end result was a complete mess. The narrative flow of the final film was a train wreck. The plot elements went back from somewhat believable to overblown Hollywood insanity and back again."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "So this is the Godfather film that I can say is bad and not get a bunch of fanboys attacking me.

EW, I DO NOT WANT TO SEE A YOUNG GIRL HIT ON HER COUSIN!The acting and writing are also inferior, and not done well.There's even a part where a helicopter tries to kill a group of men.

After watching part I and II of Mario Puzo's: The Godfather, I have to say, this movie was a disappointment. It still is a great movie,  but from my view, Al Pacino was greatly trying to re-enact what Marlon Brando perfected in part I. He failed. The whole point of Brado's performance was that he was always subtle. 'Michael' is a good character in his own right but a shadow in the greatness of 'Don Vito'. 'Vincent's' part in the movie was well executed by Andy Garcia, but yet again, Coppola tries to re-enact 'Michael' with 'Vincent'.

It's too long - doesn't deserve or earn the length, like the first two. There aren't so many layers like the first two. If anything, repeat watches lessen my opinion of the film, because I just keep finding more and more flaws. The final couple scenes are nice, but maybe not worth a three-hour watch. Coming into the third, I expected very little, so it was a nice conclusion, but as a standalone, it's terrible. Don't watch it if you didn't like the first two, but then again, if you loved the first two, there's a good chance you'll hate this one.

It is important to emphasize, however, that this film has merit by its own. At first, one may not feel very connected with this movie because the absence of those characters that we learnt to love in those 2 previous 'The Godfather'...but I think we all know the reasons why they were not there. Thus, there was a need to think in a new storyline that was also engaging but could survive without those old characters. The plot is different and it may be perceived as forced and lame..Yet when located in the right context it does make sense. I believe the performances were good, and I enjoyed seeing the other side of Michael Corleone...here we see that he was after all human, although he never regretted what he did. In The Godfather I and II his character was all negative. Michael is presented as emotionless, controlling, obsessive, and ruthless. Governed by his ego and desires of revenge. Here...we can see a different side, the one of a lonely man...one that in spite of his power can never be in peace and doesn't seem to get anything he wants no matter what he does. As a result, he questions his means..especially considering the fact that his children have chosen different paths. Overall, I have to say that I enjoyed this movie more than The Godfather II . Finally, I would like to add that even though I have heard that some disliked Sofia Coppola's performance. I did not.. He performance was not outstanding but I do not believe it was bad. Her character was relevant to the plot but it was never meant to be central...thus; her characterization doesn't really affect the value of the movie. I give it a 9"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "This one is not as good as the first two for sure, but it has many positives. For starters, Al Pacino is great once again in his role as Michael Corleone. The changing landscape of the families is also well presented as we see many youngsters trying to come into the business, while many of the key players from before are now on their way out. In addition, the homages to the first two films and footage from the first two were brilliantly used and really added a nice touch here. For the most part, it was nice to see some things brought to a closure from the first two and how the family has progressed and regressed over all of these years. However, the negatives here really are what hold the film back. Firstly, the plot can be overly complicated at times, likely due to poor storytelling. At times, things would happen and you are trying to figure out what just happened and why. However, the major issue is the acting. Andy Garcia is fine for the most part, but at times, he fails to step up to the plate. I still feel like he had the charisma and energy for the role, I just wish his performance did not slump at times. Sofia Coppola was horrendous. I always thought people were overstating how bad she is, but you simply cannot overstate it. I think my dog could have been a better Mary than her.\r Overall, this final entry into the Godfather trilogy is much like the raisin cookie to the first two's chocolate chip. No matter what, you are disappointed that it is not chocolate chip, but if you like raisins and can overcome that disappointment, you somewhat enjoy the cookie anyways.

Even more crucial, the casting of Sofia Coppola as Michael\u2019s grown-up daughter Mary. Although we\u2019ve come to experience her directing qualities a decade later, she just didn\u2019t succeed in her role and was utterly unconvincing throughout the film.

It's certainly the \"less good\" of the trilogy, but it's not a bad movie."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Superbe conclusion de la saga mafieuse que l'on pourrait r\u00e9sumer par \"le crime ne paie pas\" ou bien par \"le crime tue\", car comme de coutume, la voie de la facilit\u00e9, la voie de l'assassinat et du nettoyage par le vide n'arrange pas les choses... bien au contraire mais ainsi va la violence de ces gens-l\u00e0...Cette observation, cette \u00e9vidence, presque une tautologie -non que dis-je, une lapalissade- m'est venue \u00e0 l'esprit \u00e0 la fin de ce Parrain troisi\u00e8me du nom, une fin assur\u00e9ment dramatique digne d'une histoire \u00e0 la sicilienne dans laquelle de vendetta en vendetta, tout le monde finit par s'entretuer alors que les pr\u00e9tendus marionnettistes tombent dans la toile de ceux qu'ils croyaient manipuler.Ainsi, Michael Corleone le mafioso en qu\u00eate de r\u00e9demption qui tente une op\u00e9ration \"mains propres\" afin de tirer un trait sur son pass\u00e9 et comme -si souvent- afin d'assurer l'avenir de sa et de \"la\" famille se retrouve encore une fois pris dans l'engrenage infernal de Cosa Nostra.Conclusion \u00e9difiante et touchante mais sans complaisance, ce dernier Parrain est un v\u00e9ritable accomplissement pour Al Pacino qui a gagn\u00e9 en maturit\u00e9 et en exp\u00e9rience et d\u00e9livre ici une extraordinaire prestation. Le jeune poulain, Andy Garcia, s'av\u00e8re \u00e0 la hauteur, ce qui n'est pas rien m\u00eame si on sait d\u00e9j\u00e0 qu'il s'agit d'un acteur tr\u00e8s estimable en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Quant \u00e0 Eli Wallach en vieux grigou retors, que dire sinon que ce monstre sacr\u00e9 tire encore davantage le film vers le haut !Moins long (tout de m\u00eame !) que les deux pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents -mais un peu long quand m\u00eame- Le Parrain 3 est toujours d'une ambiance inimitable faite de r\u00e9unions de pontes duplices et de rencontres discr\u00e8tes o\u00f9 l'on fomente les prochains meurtres comme l'on avance ses pi\u00e8ces sur l'\u00e9chiquier du double jeu et de la fourberie.C'est aussi bien \u00e9videmment un lourd passif familial -et sentimental- dont m\u00eame un Don -ou certain Don- peut \u00e9prouver quelque remords et regret. Contrairement au Parrain 2, le sc\u00e9nario reste assez clair et suffisamment d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 pour qu'on en suive les tenants et aboutissants sans migraine, alors que chacun tire les ficelles en coulisses.Quasiment un sans-faute donc pour le grand final et le meilleur opus de la saga."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "The movie would have obviously been worse than both the first and second movie since they had set such high standards for any moviegoer. The reasons why this movie has been panned is because of the various subplots, the unnecessary romance scenes, its inadequacy of being a standalone film (unlike Godfather II), and the atrocious acting of Sofia Coppola. However, the highs in this movie are very high. VERY high. I loved the second half of the movie, especially when Michael tours Kay around Sicily, as it is one of the more tender and beautiful scenes of this movie, if not the Godfather trilogy. The chemistry between Diane and Al is utter beauty. The opera scene is the greatest poetic justice I have seen in the trilogy. Heck, I even find that scene better than the baptism climax of the first movie. Andy Garcia was fully fit as Sonny's bastard son Vincent, and his character is one of the best of the Godfather trilogy as it depicted a fruitful change from a brash, rowdy man to a more responsible, sacrificial Don. The family struggles are a vital part of the movie, as you would see from the start where Michael quarrels with Kay about Anthony becoming an opera singer. The religious undertones too are commendable, especially the subplot on the murder of Pope John Paul I. The climax of this movie, where Michael Corleone contemplates shows what he has lost: his three loves of his depressing life. He lost Apollonia due to mistrust, he lost Kay due to his business, and he lost Mary due to gangster rivalry. On paper, it may seem he died of old age, but he actually died due to these three aspects. In short, it is a flawed masterpiece."}], "recommendations": ["american_gangster", "creed_ii", "the_godfather_part_ii", "suburbicon", "true_grit", "the_departed", "the_magnificent_seven", "man_on_fire", "the_karate_kid_part_iii", "public_enemies", "knives_out", "changeling", "hereafter", "body_of_lies", "the_invasion", "ben_hur", "reminiscence", "the_prestige", "no_country_for_old_men", "donnie_brasco", "mystic_river", "creed", "the_devil_all_the_time", "the_gambler", "what_happened_to_monday"]}
