      "text": "Michael Pitt plays a biologist who's researching the eye with lab assistant Brit Marling. His fascination with the subject and love for a woman ultimately lead him to questioning his strictly scientific beliefs. Although there are some philosophical discussions, the script is intelligent (as opposed to intellectual). It's mysteries slowly unfold with smart plotting and potent performances. Director Mike Cahill (\"Another Earth\") tells an enthralling story with intriguing visual style. More than science fiction, this film is intriguingly spiritual, while being completely compelling as a film experience."

It's unfortunate,however, that some pacing problems, lame attempts at humor and tech-speak dialogue bog down the flow of this otherwise-engaging release."

      "text": "\u201cWhat would you do if something spiritual disproved your scientific beliefs?\u201d\r Science and spirituality is at the forefront of Mike Cahill\u2019s second directorial feature. If that doesn\u2019t already excite you, perhaps you have never had those intense, elongated conversations about either or both of the subjects. Two of the most divisive subjects in human history are the real stars of Cahill\u2019s second film; a promising feature centered on bold claims, knowledge and questioning.\r In 2011, Mike Cahill premiered his feature length debut Another Earth at the Sundance Film Festival to mixed reviews. In 2012, I was able to finally enjoy Another Earth and became acquainted with one of the most promising American indie film directors working today. Three years after his life-altering debut feature, I Origins proves to be a personal cinematic study of bravado that questions whether science or spirituality is the true way to prove the existence of human beings.\r I Origins doesn\u2019t quite reach the level of Another Earth, but it does get to within reach in bold and dramatic fashion.\r Cahill is faithful to a cast that has served him well in previous endeavors. He recasts indie darling Brit Marling as Karen, a sophisticated scientist who works faithfully next to Ian Gray (the always impressive Michael Pitt). Together, using iris scanning and sophisticated technological advancements of scientific study, the two become lab rats obsessed with the intent of disproving the existence of a spiritual being greater than the human race.\r It becomes clear that Ian has a skeptical view of spirituality. Cahill, who never labels his protagonists and steers away from religion whenever possible, offers up well thought out arguments for both beliefs and Ian\u2019s distrust in anything pertaining to the soulfulness of humanity. Ian\u2019s life is anything but black and white, especially once he gazes upon a billboard and into the eyes of a beautiful woman by the name of Sofi (Astrid Berg\u00e8s-Frisbey). Ian looks for Sofi, and upon first gaze, the two fall in love. For some, I Origins may be mistaken as an eternal love-story based on the first act. But through a surprising sequence of unexpected tragedy, the film takes an unexpected turn into the deep observation of chance and possibility. What begins for Ian is a new phase in his life where, like Dr. Frankenstein, he plays God using science, together with his lab partner and own personal Igor, Karen, dictates and questions his very beliefs to his core. Through this, I Origins becomes an endless fable of answer seeking for Ian. The answers, however, are never revealed to the audience.\r Over the next few years, Ian becomes a seemingly ordinary family man. Under the surface, he evolves into a pioneer in his research and studies. The film offers many unanswered questions as well as an abundance of coincidences that take away any authenticity of the screenplay\u2019s flow. This aside, Cahill retains his audience\u2019s curiosity when Ian finds a match of his beloved Sofi\u2019s unique eyes in India with a little home-less Indian girl Salomina (Kashish). What begins for Ian is the key to unlocking the connection between the past lives of people living, dead and the memories that they believe are retained through iris patterns. The film is given momentum and brought to new life in the third and exhilarating final act.\r Since its premiere at Sundance this year, I Origins has been my most anticipated indie of 2014, and I could happily say that I did not disappoint. Kept together with an ensemble effort by its cast, lead by the poignant Pitt, Marling and Steven Yuen of AMC\u2019s The Walking Dead for good measure, the film becomes one of the loudest commentaries of the year for spirituality and science without ever answering too much and leaving one to make their own decisions.\r Originality is the basis of Cahill\u2019s film and the mantra of his filmmaking technique. Eyeing the greater picture of narrative and inciting cinephiles, intellects and storytellers, I Origins is a bold voice of the future of magnificent independent feature films. Much like Ian itself, there is always a grey area of doubt, and perhaps, the film may hit an emotional and personal chord with people who have strong faiths or strong beliefs in the use of data and proof. Thankfully, I Origins does nothing to prove either subject as a favourite or underdog. Instead, the film offers a platform for intense conversation and analysis well after the final credits roll.\r Art is one of the largest catalysts towards asking the unanswerable and questioning the unbelievable. Cahill\u2019s film style could be best described as a cinematic lens into the reality of grand human perception. Ambitious and wholly entertaining, I Origins may very well be one of the longest talked about films of the year and surely the most talked about indie film of the summer."

      "text": "The plot is okay but this movie is way too predictable to be any good. Perhaps some better editing and a shorter length would have helped. What could have been a good film was executed very poorly. Even the ending was blatantly obvious. The movie might as well have had director commentary giving away plot points.\r The (unnecessary) science jargon/aspects has some poetic license too, searching individual organisms - really? We can map a genome but we can't search through more than one at a time?"

      "text": "Incredible idea of a hypothetical link between that which is not seen through the sensory perception & that which is physically seen.\r The environment in which all is woven into contains the duality of Spirituality&Science, Yang&Yin, Metaphysical&Physical, etc... (with the 3rd force not being directly observed).\r 9 not 10, because the Soul-Spiritual aspects of the ' I ' evolve from one to another incarnation and it's reflection(s) in the physical body would thus differ with each subsequent incarnation."
