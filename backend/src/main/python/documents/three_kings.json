Yoon C (and detractors among the metacritics), while your comments are intelligent and incisive, I would argue that this movie is great precisely because it plays (and I mean, plays) along all those lines without telling you what to think. If anything it shows that all people's opinions are ridiculous and it imposes none of its own. It sounds to me like you are looking for a movie to tell you what to think of war in Iraq (that is, to tell you \"war is hell\" or something like that - the message you are expecting becausue you've already heard it in other movies and novels). Whatever else you say about this, it's a war movie unlike any other. It rocks first and foremost, but it also socks and it even (dare I say) does make you think. And it's still relevant seven years later, in ways that it was not when it was made. That anticipatory quality makes it much more artful than the huge majority of \"deep\" arthouse movies with a moral agenda. Maybe the best thing about it is that it gets the Schwarzenegger-set to watch and rewatch a movie where a child cries over her dead mother, where men are torn by morally ambiguity, where in the end we are at least given an inkling of how hard it is to \"do the right thing.\""}, {"rating": "10", "text": "The 3rd best film of 1999(next to American Beauty and Magnolia)."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "\u2299\u2299\u2299\u2299\u2299\u2299\u2299\u2299\u2299\u2299\u2299\u2299\u2299\u2299\u2299\u2299\u2299\u2299\u2299\u2299\u2299\u2299\u2299\u2299\u2299\u2299\u2299\u2299\u2299\u2299\u2299\u2299\u2299\u2299\u2299$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "$.$.$.$.$.$.$.$.$.$.$.$.$.$.$.$.$.$.$.$.$.$.$.$.$.$.$.$.\u25a0\u300b\u25a0\u300b\u25a0\u300b\u25a0\u300b\u25a0\u300b\u25a0\u300b\u25a0\u300b\u25a0\u300b\u25a0\u300b\u25a0\u300b\u25a0\u300b\u25a0\u300b\u25a0\u300b\u25a0\u300b\u25a0\u300b\u25a0\u300b"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Not for those who don't like politics.

George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, and Spike Jonze, are all good here and really help this film out. The direction from David O. Russell was also very good and gave this one a unique feel. Many war films do not really have character development and this one did not have a ton, but it at least had some to let us know the motivation behind the main characters' actions. However, the narrative slacks at times and can be a tad boring at times for my liking and even when it was not, I was never fully gripped by what was happening. It was certainly interesting enough, but the plot was a tad too outlandish and predictable for me to fully enjoy it. Now, the film is still entertaining and is still very well made and well acted, so I can see why it got the praise it did. However, this one was just not fully for me, though it was still a pretty good film in my eyes."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "are we shooting..Three KingsThe sense of urgency is kept alive throughout the course of the feature with a hint of amusing sense present in each characters that resonates the most with practicality no matter how much peculiar and unpredictable it may go later.

Mark Wahlberg, George Clooney and Ice Cube (surprisingly he is good too) all of them are doing a great job supporting each other in this almost 2 hour journey and gives enough room to each other too.
