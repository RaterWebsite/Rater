We both enjoyed the massive-scale landscapes, the back-and-forth between George and Tarzan (and Jane and evil Belgian guy), the action sequences, and the overall story arc.  This felt like old-fashioned story telling with a generous helping of digital cinema thrown in for effect.\r The story itself is straightforward - Tarzan is brought back to Africa to unwittingly help exploit its population and satisfy an old grudge at the same time.  BUT...he obviously isn't having that any time soon.  Sam Jackson comes along for the ride an a flimsy (but disbelief-suspendable) reason that ends up adding to Tarzan's motivation.  And then there is Jane...one should not mess with Jane and expect Tarzan to be cool about it, right?\r I see reviews calling the back-story heavy-handed revisionist history.  Maybe, but I will say this - the movie gave me a chance to talk to my son about colonial Africa for the first time.

My friend and I were trying to decide on a movie on a kind of the spur of the moment thing.  We read the user reviews on Ghostbusters and decided against it.  Then I mentioned that a co-worker at work was raving about the Tarzan movie-which wasn't on my list to see.  We read some of the reviews here on Metacritic, and the majority were favorable-the user reviews.  We figured it would be an OK movie, but in actuality were totally blown away.  What an amazing movie, the full scope of the movie was incredible-storyline, plot, acting, action, and most of all the cinematography!!  This is not the Tarzan movies that you grew up with!!  This is the coming of age Tarzan movie that is finally deserving of the big screen and all it entails!!  Don't make the mistake I almost made and let it slip by me.  My friend and I agreed this was our favorite movie of the summer so far!  Whats up with the reviews from the Critics on Metacritic??-shame on you!!  I am sure many of you have been mislead before by the critics.  Well don't let it happen here, believe me take my word for it you won't be sorry!  The only thing in the movie that was a little out of kilter seemed to be Samuel L. Jackson.  That said I love him and in the end I was glad that he was in the movie, as he provided some light heartedness to the movie and some needed comedic moments.  I won't hesitate buying this movie when it comes out on DVD as I want to watch it over and over-still you need to see it on the big screen to do it justice, as again the cinematography is over the top!"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar... Tarzan was a product of another age- an American looking back on the Victorian Age of Empire and the African colonial experience with rose colored glasses. The book was considered progressive and enlightened, sad as that may seem now...\rYates et al have attempted to rediscover the rip-roaring adventure with modern sensibilities, and i think succeeded. Unfortunately it is in the age of BlackLivesMatter. They do matter, really and truly, but this is just a movie. Not an attempt to rewrite history. An attempt to reconcile a childish story from another age with our desire to right wrongs but any nuances have fallen on deaf ears.\rI enjoyed the movie a lot, and i refuse to fall prey to political correctness and condemn it as white paternalism. There is no way to tell Tarzan in the modern era without ruffling feathers. As such i see this as probably the last retelling of the story, but at least he goes out with a bang. All his animal friends were there (i recall the old serials on weekend morning tv before internet or even cable in the backwoods i grew up in) but in a \"believable\" fashion. Jane is fabulous, and the Tarzan yell finally makes an appearance. The flaws of the film stem from attempts to avoid paternalism, but in this day and age you avoid these types of stories if you're trying to be \"safe\".

Trust audience ratings, and not the biases of cynical professional \u201ccritics.\u201d Generally, critics gave high ratings to The Jungle Book, including its CGI effects, yet are critical of the CGI in The Legend of Tarzan. Isn\u2019t it odd that the same company that produced the fine CGI effects for The Jungle Book completely lost those abilities while working on The Legend of Tarzan? [perhaps this illustrates the pre-determined bias of some critics?] And the non-CGI actual scenery filmed in Gabon makes a stunning feast for the eyes. Anyway, this movie is about a story, a good script, and fine acting, not CGI eye candy. Prominent critics keep saying the story is worn out and out-dated, but to those who loved the Edgar Rice Burroughs novels, the story has never been accurately portrayed on the big screen. I read my collection of 24 Tarzan novels many times as a youngster during the \u201860\u2019s. The challenge for moviemakers has always been that the character changes and develops so much over the course of the series, and conveying Tarzan\u2019s complexities in a 2 hour film was daunting. With a 32 year span since the last movie effort to bring a live action, not animated, Tarzan into a movie adaptation, the need to appeal to older lovers of the novels, and to explain the story to next generations, presented a major challenge. Yates has effectively pursued both objectives. If one objects to remakes of classic adventure heroes, or to Edgar Rice Burroughs, or his novels, in general, then this is not the film for you. But if you would like to see an effort to seek to realistically enable the character of the novel series to come to life in a movie, you will not be disappointed. And it is CGI technology that enables this effort to authentically bring the nearly superhuman, yet still vulnerable, Tarzan of the novels into a live feature film. There are so few well-made, uplifting, and exciting movies, and especially ones also including an emotionally connected romance, that it is a shame so many will miss out on this one due to critics with negative bias who never gave the film a chance. The Legend of Tarzan, due to negative reviews, will likely not have a sequel, so it seems this film will become the best representation of the genuine Tarzan from the novel series. And that is quite an accomplishment. Try it in IMAX 3D. Impressive! I will definitely see it again - many times."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "The Legend of Tarzan is directed by David Yates and stars the likes of Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, Samuel L. Jackson, Margot Robbie, Djimon Hounsou, Jim Broadbent, and Christoph Waltz.\rWith a director such as the amazing David Yates, you'd except your fantasy movie experience to be special considering his brilliant previous work on the Harry Potter franchise but you'd just be left disappointed - like me.\rThis movie had it all going for, a big budget, an amazing cast and director all they had to do was come up with a simple script that pushes Tarzan towards his adventure on the jungle, and they failed miserably. The story is so confusing and even worse uninteresting that at a point you're left asking yourself - is Tarzan even on this ?\rAnd when we finally do arrive at the ever so expected Tarzan classic sequences such as, swinging through the jungle, it is so disappointing and terribly done that you realize it was not worth the wait at all. Heck, even the fight scenes with Tarzan in it were so poorly shot, with intense shaky cam that makes it nearly impossible to tell what's going on. Then there are a lot of side stories that are just thrown in there for the sake of the story that you do not care about at all.\rOn a more positive note though, Samuel L. Jackson looked like he was having fun on the role and his character gave the film that much needed energy from time to time. Christoph Waltz however was generic to an unbelievable degree, his character's motivation for doing the things he's doing make very little sense, not that anybody even cares about it either way. Even the CGI was mediocre, in a year when we've had movies like The Jungle Book where the talking animals looked almost photo-realistic, Legend of Tarzan just fails on that and many other levels too.\rThere were a few scenes here and there that were fine-ish to look at and slightly interesting but overall I would not recommend this film at all. It is filled with potential but only ends up being a major disappointment that suffers from terrible pacing and a story which is all over the place to say the least."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "I went to see The Legend of Tarzan because I'm a huge fan of Alexander Skarsgard, and in that regard, it doesn't disappoint. He has screen presence to spare and gives a great understated performance, which is quite refreshing in a summer blockbuster. He has the perfect balance between English aristocrat and animal, and does a convincing job selling his bond with wildlife.\r Skarsgard's chemistry with the rest of the cast is on point, especially with Samuel L. Jackson. Margot Robbie was also pretty good, especially considering that she's relegated to be a glorified MacGuffin. However, I'm afraid I can't say the same about Christoph Waltz, who at this point, has gotten pretty tiresome because of his same old mustache twirling (literally) jerk shtick. He almost single-handedly ruined the movie. Where's Gary Oldman when you need him?\r The Legend of Tarzan has its heart in the right place, since it wants to go for the most politically correct route possible, even though it relies on cliches like the mighty whitey, the damsel in distress or the aforementioned mustache twirling villain. Its story isn't particularly engaging or nuanced, but it has the decency of never being boring thanks to an agile pacing.\r I've never been a fan of David Yates' direction, and this movie didn't do anything to change my mind about it. He still likes to use the same dull and dark color palette, which is a baffling choice for a film set in the Congo jungle. The action scenes are decently staged, but many of them feel pointless and contrived. And since the villain is more annoying than menacing, there's not much sense of urgency in them.\r I won't go as far as saying that The Legend of Tarzan is a bad movie. But I can't help but feel that it's a missed opportunity to be a deep exploration of complicated themes like poaching, race relations or cultural identity."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This movie is just great!

To make him \"go native,\" it takes a tired plot about Belgians (led by the inevitably evil Christoph Waltz) mining the Congo for diamonds and slaves. Margot Robbie does make a lively, lovely Jane. Even though the story is somewhat clunky, often predictable and just a tad absurd, there's lots of magnificent scenery and jungle spectacle (although some of the CGI flora and fauna isn't convincing).

The plot at its heart is a simple damsel in distress as a rehabilitated Tarzan (now John of Greystoke) returns to his animalistic ways in order to save his beloved Jane. However the narrative of this straightforward plot takes many bends in the road as we include subplots of slavery, jurisdiction, politics, and a rather odd and perverted infatuation. It is all far too much with a lot going on and nothing focused on. The characters are one dimensional with very little tension and emotion feeding through, and Tarzan's connection with the animals is either ham-fisted or unreliable. We are made to believe that he can cope in this wild and then given an on the nose flashback to just remind you of who he is. The flashbacks are unnecessary but I believe are there to pad out the story as with the lack of depth there is very little to sustain the running time, despite it being less than two hours. The cast are rather bland with Skarsgaard fighting a dull character, Samuel L Jackson being Samuel L Jackson, Margot Robbie given little to do and Christoph Waltz basically phoning it in.

This is Africa, where wealthy white guys walk digital alligators on leashes as though it were outside the cantina on Mos Eisley. Aside from a few touching moments, a few chuckles aimed at children, this movie is pure, unadulterated Hollywood drivel. You can tell by the generic soundtrack theme, as it swells at the most predictable moments. Samuel Jackson, perhaps looking for a paycheck and having seemingly no fun at all, is tiresome as the obligatory comic relief sidekick, and now and again the character digs into soulful narratives about war and his regrets, groping for soul and coming up empty. The flashbacks are awkwardly timed and paced, particularly those of the young Tarzan, and are spliced in randomly throughout the narrative. Sometimes the gorgeous scenery makes for a scene in itself, and the few times I had that thought, breathing at the chance to relax for a second, there was an awkward cut to some other random shot. The Jane character is pure eye candy, the quintessential damsel in distress, revamped for the politically correct feminist era, though not quite to the point where she can actually take care of herself in the wild. The villain, who's motivations are wildly unclear, comes to her rescue when she finds herself cowering before a awkwardly rendered CGI Gorilla. His modus operandi is to choke people with a bracelet, and for some reason, that renders him almost invincible (the villain, not the gorilla, though neither would have been plausible in the slightest). There is a joke about priests in there somewhere, I guess, because the deadly bracelet, the deadliest piece of jewelry in a movie in decades, has a cross on it. The evil 'mercenaries' are as faceless and nameless as the soldiers guarding the slaves, who Tarzan mercilessly beats to a pulp, with his uncanny animalistic version of martial arts. I couldn't tell if the characters or the CGI creatures were more lifeless, so this inquiry was almost entertaining. It's one of those movies that is made in tandem with the video game, and I could almost predict where the different levels would be. Level one, shoot dust covered africans guarding the diamond mine. Level two, wrestle with gorillas. Level 3, run along faux digitally rendered branches with a rifle, etc, etc, ad nauseum. Now, there are some pros. The general message of man living in gentle harmony with nature, as contrasted to the more exploitative traits of the slave traders, is relevant. Looking into a digital elephant's eyes was sweet, though Samuel Jackson's stiff period acting ruined that; Tarzan rubbing heads with lionesses, and Samuel Jackson's rote astonished look. Jane and Tarzan had some chemistry, if in a predictable, cologne ad sort of way. Now, I still like the Tarzan archetype, so it was watchable. I just had to squirm in my seat to overlook plot holes and limp characters. The digital gorillas bonding with the young Tarzan is touching. Oh and Tarzan eventually meets with the tribal leader who's son he killed decades before (obviously), and that fizzles out almost immediately after some anticlimactic scuffling... there is supposed to be some subtle catharsis (I guess), and Tarzan runs ahead, leaving behind a teary african in a leopard head suit.

The plot begins to take on more substance as well, giving you a reason to root for our hero outside of just wanting to see him save his girl. The movie still suffers from lulls whenever Skarsg\u00e5rd and Jackson aren't onscreen, but Waltz and Robbie do an admirable job of keeping us going until they are back onscreen. Robbie in particular is given some sharp dialog. Shame about that standard damsel in distress role.Overall this \"legend\" is quite flawed. Not without it's high points though. It manages to overcome it's issues in just enough ways to still be enjoyable. There proves to be just enough thrills to keep you going, even if nothing here will blow you away."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Wasn't really expecting much but i gotta say hands down the best live-action Tarzan film.\rPros\r-The actors are perfect for their roles.\r-The action was surprisingly good but i wish there was more.\r-Tarzan swinging through the forest was particularly awesome but once again there wasn't much of it. (he didn't even slide on branches/logs, but atleast he did do the yell a couple times.)\r Cons\r-The whole overarching plot of the movie seems a bit forced but it''s passable.\r-A bit too romancey ( Very slow flashbacks that could've been done in less time or don't really add much but just kill the momentum of the film).\r-Felt like they were torn between playing to an audience of people who know who Tarzan is supposed to be and an audience that's never heard a thing about Tarzan. Mainly felt like they were playing to people who knew who Tarzan was (especially the beginning part with Samuel L Jackson) but backtracked and tossed in some backstory wherever they could."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Director David Yates' \"Hook-esque\" take on \"Tarzan\" feels more like a sequel to David Yates' nonexistent \"Tarzan\" predecessor than anything else. Lacking the life, vim, and vigor of most other filmic adaptations featuring the classic Edgar Rice Burroughs character, \"The Legend Of Tarzan\" plods along on sluggish pacing, spotty CGI, and muted performances from all cast members except the lovely Samuel L. Jackson. It's not to say there isn't some enjoyment to be had. I just simply wanted more rope-swinging and \"uhhh--ah--uh--ah--uhhhhhhhhhh--ah--uh--ah--uhhh--ing.\" And, yes, that's the closest I could get to a phonetic spelling of the Tarzan yell."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "I do not understand what Hollywood has before. Will it destroy itself?\rThe umpteenth Tarzan film we presented one and then also the worst so far.\rHere is unacceptable. Just beautiful pictures are not enough today."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "If you like Tarzan you would probably like this movie. \u00a0It's a big grand production serious in tone with state-of-the-art animal effects and a few laughs. \u00a0Most importantly it doesn't go on way too long as is the stupid trend.  Is it somehow underwhelming though? \u00a0Yes.\rMy problem with it is I am bored out of my mind now by all these big Hollywood formula flicks, and I don't much like Tarzan.  I still can recognize its accomplishment on some level and the fact that it delivers on its title for the most part."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "As a long time Burroughs fan I greatly enjoyed this attempt to capture the original concept of Tarzan as imagined and written by the author. This film is not the movie Tarzan. Th film successfully reconstructs Tarzan as ERB wrote him in 25 novels. Although the director and screenplay writers have altered the story, they also have managed to visualize the original Tarzan. However, the film lacks the sense of adventure that the movie versions of the 'wild boy' so successfully exploited. The version of Tarzan might be a bit too human for audiences looking for a superhero. So with some reservations, I recommend this film, especially for other long time fans of Edgar Rice Burroughs who have always desired to see a Tarzan film done right."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Nothing impressive in my opinion and at some points a bit over the top with Tarzan being able to fight against anybody or even against masses of people. Don't get me wrong, it was a fun movie, but I did want to see something more here."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "You would think a Tarzan remake directed by David Yates, starring Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, Margot Robbie, and Christoph Waltz would be good or at the very least entertaining. Instead why not subject yourself to the longest hour and 50 minutes of what can only be described as torture. This is by far one of the worst movies of 2016, nothing remotely good about it. Amongst the endless mess of CGI there is a story that is constantly being interrupted by a pointless flashback attempting to add depth to its characters and failing miserably. I couldn't wait for this to be over. Not recommended, even a shirtless Skarsg\u00e5rd is not enough to pay money for this rubbish."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "The very definition of your average summer blockbuster movie, improved by the presence of Christopher Waltz and a more detailed backstory than in previous adaptions of the legendary character."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "One word, BORING. Samuel L. Jackson is funny but not enough to redeem this long snooze fest. Though the plot tries to divert from the original story, it is too simple and thus very predictable. A disappointment."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "The issue with \"The Legend of Tarzan\" was that I didn't give a rat's ass about any of the characters. It tries to create a romance between Tarzan and Jane so heartfelt and magical, but  it doesn't have the slightest bit of affection in my eyes. There chemistry was like a bag filled with garbage about to be burned by an incinerator filled with fire. In addition, it has a big issue with it's pacing. The film starts out slow by introducing us to the important characters, but it stays that level throughout the entire two acts. When the third act commences, it starts to build up into this brutally action-packed load of nonsense. I would rather have that dispersed in those two acts and then have another over the top scene at it's conclusion. You want to watch a good Tarzan film? Watch the animated version of Tarzan back in 1999.

I thought that it would be an epic adaptation of Tarzan but it wasn't that. The main problem I had with this movie is that, it's slow. It takes a while before the action happens. Speaking of the action, there's actually a few well done action scenes. The cast was alright, I thought that Samuel L. Jackson was the best thing in the movie cause it's Samuel L.Jackson! The cgi on the apes is meh, it's not really that spectacular or anything. The Legend of Tarzan overall is not really that great but it does have a few great moments. If you love Tarzan then you might be a little disappointed with this movie. If I were you, I would stick with the Disney Tarzan movie."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "both me and my partner watched this film and the first thing we said to each other upon exit was 'did you get it?'. the graphics were great as we watched it in 3D but there was absolutely no story line. there was a bad guy who was trying to catch Tarzan for an unknown reason (something to do with these crystals) and there was barely any detail about Tarzan growing up from a child to a man. all of a sudden at the beginning he was a grown man in Britain planning to return to Africa to protect something or prevent something from happening. albeit, me and my partner were both drunk and alternated going to the toilet to urinate but there was never a point where neither of us were watching the film and filled each other in upon return. I personally didn't understand the motive of Tarzan's feud against these ivory hunters, who knows perhaps I am wasted but it ended so abruptly that I had to entertain myself somehow."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "L'histoire est nul,Tarzan aussi, les ennemis sont inint\u00e9ressant, Les effets sp\u00e9ciaux on \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par un stagiaire.\r1 point pour Margot Robbie car en plus d'\u00eatre harley, c'est la moins mauvaise par rapport aux autres."}], "recommendations": ["the_hobbit_an_unexpected_journey", "king_arthur_legend_of_the_sword", "mowgli_legend_of_the_jungle", "blade_of_the_47_ronin", "maleficent_mistress_of_evil", "beowulf", "bumblebee", "the_chronicles_of_narnia_the_voyage_of_the_dawn_treader", "the_bfg", "x_men_apocalypse", "spider_man_into_the_spider_verse", "avengers_age_of_ultron", "the_call_of_the_wild", "thor", "alice_through_the_looking_glass", "fantastic_beasts_the_crimes_of_grindelwald", "the_witcher_nightmare_of_the_wolf", "the_13th_warrior", "sin_city_a_dame_to_kill_for", "9", "300_rise_of_an_empire", "maleficent", "the_hobbit_the_desolation_of_smaug", "man_of_steel", "wonder_woman"]}
