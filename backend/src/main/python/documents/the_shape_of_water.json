In 'Splash' Tom Hanks - your everyman guy gets the stunning mermaid. It's cute, fun and doesn't take itself too seriously. In this film, the ordinary girl gets a slimy cat-eating creature from the Black Lagoon (or rather, he gets her) and it takes itself very seriously in some artsy intensely annoying self-indulgent way which absolutely misses the mark. Guillermo del Toro pounds us over the head with his water theme (we get it already) and creates a female lead without understanding anything about women. She's childlike and annoying as hell, skipping down the corridor like a giddy child, implausibly falling for a monster not long after mopping up blood after he bites off and spits out human fingers (their 'falling in love' montage *could* possibly have been made believable, but absolutely was not), masturbating in the bath every morning (sorry guys - sure women masturbate, but not in the bath to an egg timer - del Toro put this in to heavy-handedly enforce his water theme and that's absolutely how it came across. She can do NOTHING without the help of every male character around her and is quite pathetic when she *could* have had an arc (the shy cleaner falls in love and rises in confidence, orchestrating and pulling off a rescue mission. But oh no, childlike and helpless she achieves nothing and the men around her have to save her mission at every turn). The film plods on forever with a second and third act that left me squirming in my seat and desperate to leave and finally ends anti-climatically and predictably. It didn't surprise me when Guillermo del Toro came out afterwards (this was an industry screening) and talked for 2 hours about his masterpiece and how profound it was, and how he dreamt it up as a child, because every boy without a girlfriend wants to imagine that even if he as an ugly amphibious monster, he could still score sex with a willing female with a size zero figure.

Just to start, both the protagonist and the sidekick are an utter pain. They barely had any dimension, how are we as spectators supposed to feel invested in their goals like that? How can we root for them? The pacing is awkward and unnecessarily long. A lot of things are just there for plot convenience. Subplots are thrown into the mix only to be forgotten immediately without any consequence. Even with Alexandre Desplat, the music is forgetable. The ending is abrupt and we are left with a lot of stuff still hanging.Of course, there's good stuff in the movie too. The acting was good (although a little unrealistic at times), Octavia's and Michael characters were enjoyable and the main plot (when we got that on screen) was on point and that's why this movie is just average to me. It does really good in one side, but what it does wrong, it does it really wrong (sometimes cringe worthy).If you have an open mind and you just want to watch something without thinking about it too much and just drift with it, go ahead and give it a go.

It's not that it's bad -- it's OK, in my opinion -- but for the life of me, I cannot understand why it was nominated for a best picture Oscar (which was the whole reason I saw it in the first place -- damn you, Oscars!).I'm not really familiar with the director's other films, but based on what I read about them, I was expecting something dark, quirky and mysterious. For me, this movie was none of those things. It was bland and predictable (overall). I mean, there were some nice moments (yeah, I laughed at a few of those jokes and felt sorry for the water-man) and some solid 'mise-en-sc\u00e8ne' elements (as we used to say in film class). But I found the story to be somewhat simplistic and childlike, which -- in my opinion -- lead directly to the entirely predictable and 'perfect' ending. (Or perhaps the director was going for a childlike fairy-tale type story? Possible, but there's a lot of 'reality' in there too [i.e., graphic sex & violence], so difficult to make that case). Also -- as some other viewers may have noticed -- the tone of the movie seems off in some parts. Like the people in the audience cracked up sometimes when it seemed to be a serious moment, which was confusing. (I should also add that I laughed out loud on three separate occasions during the movie, while some in the audience did so about 10 more times than that, further adding to my confusion.) To be honest, the story seemed to drag through much of the film. Like, it was interesting and I didn't mind watching it (although I did check my watch a couple times), but I wasn't exactly on the edge of my seat or running as fast as I could back from the bathroom, if you know what I mean.  Which brings me back to the beginning of this. Why is this movie being touted as the front runner for the best picture Oscar?! Mysterious indeed. I mean I could see this coming on TV in a few years and someone thinking, 'Wow, weird flick about a woman falling in love with a fish-man, but I've got some other things to do' -- CLICK. I've seen Lady Bird, Phantom Thread, The Florida Project and Darkest Hour recently, and I can understand why they've been nominated for various awards, but I'm having some trouble wrapping my head around this one ... oh well, I guess differences of opinion make the world go round."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "To be honest, the whole premise of a love story between a woman and some weird merman seemed unattractive to me to begin with, but the Oscars did their advertising job in the end. And my intuition did not fail, Shape of Water is boring, weird, and overly-sweet all at the same time.To start with the good things - visually it's well-filmed and the 60's are stylishly presented. It's nothing ground-breaking, but overall solid. The second good aspect are the actors, everyone plays their roles convincingly. I would point out Michael Shannon in particular, he proved that he can be a great antagonist before, and he's done it again, I was actually rooting for his character throughout.However, the story is a dull bizarre mess. To begin with, it is overwhelmingly unoriginal - the sheepish sugar-sweet lonely protagonist, the captive creature that is tortured instead of being communicated with, the army man antagonist. The movie is just a drag, and everything is as predictable as it can be.Now I can buy the ancient overused trope about the protagonist empathizing to some captive intelligent creature, but explicitly having sex with it? And yeah, there's actually plenty of unnecessary nudity (Shannon shags his wife. Ok.) and allusions to the creature's penis. Well, whatever gets you that Oscar, I guess. I mean I'm no prune, but in my opinion nudity is justified when it helps to convey some point and flesh out the story. But this, this just looks like Del Toro's sick creepy sexual fantasies brought to life. Sorry, but my suspension of disbelief just doesn't cover the \"woman gets turned on by slippery scaly aquatic monster\" thing. What's your next move, Del Toro, a movie about furries?To add to that, there's an absolutely redundant meaningless side plot about a gay old man failing to hook up with another guy, and couple of scenes dedicated to showing that Shannon's character has a sexual fetish for silence. That's when you thought this movie couldn' get any more creepy.And since we're at it, I would really question how realistic it is that some random cleaners are allowed access to classified assets in a top-secret research facility. There's also an uncomfortably stereotypical black woman who overcompensates for the muteness of the main character, never managing to finally shut the hell up. Also at one point the movie has a musical number in it, like in some Disney flick. That was also the moment when my facepalm intensity peaked. Yeah, and isn't this merman's design very reminiscent of some sidekick of Hellboy in Del Toro's own movie? Pathetic.So, as they say, best movie my ass.

The critics suckered me into seeing \"Pan's Labyrinth,\" and as with that movie, \"The Shape of Water\" is blunt in its insistence that tinkly fantasy interspersed with jarring scenes of gore is refreshing and significant.No spoilers here, but it wouldn't matter; there are no surprises. I won't fault a film for lack of originality if it's otherwise rewarding to watch. This was not. By the predictable end, contrivances and pacing had worn away whatever sympathy I'd felt obliged as an audience member to try to feel for the characters.I made the mistake of reading reviews, hoping to find some insight into why movies like these are so celebrated critically. But professional critics, in real publications, seem unable to write positively of these sorts of movies in anything other than a prose matching the grandeur of the \"lush visuals\" therein. It's as though a sea creature's spiny appendage pierced through their skulls and deposited a sense not only of the film's significance, but of their own.I'd give it a zero, but some acknowledgement will go to the effort put into the stagnant, boring visual compositions that critics love (and which I don't care about, but take skill to achieve, I would assume), and to the actors for keeping a straight face."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "The worst movie I have seen in years. Incredibly predictable, boring and filled with plotholes. Shallow characters and rushed pacing with cringy dialogue. Did not care about the fish-dude at all. I felt like they didn't even try to make it relatable in any way. There was nothing even shown from his perspective. The movie is also extremely saturated with political and liberal propaganda in the most blatant way possible. Its not even trying to be subtle or clever about it. Its like they had a checklist while writing the script. \"First of all, lets bash Christian values every chance we get. Lets make the \"villains\" quote the Bible cus that's edgy right? Also lets clearly show that bible-movies suck with empty theaters showing them.. (whut why?) Moving on: Lets have the girl masturbate a couple of time on screen cus its also super edgy. Make sure the nipples are on screen: Check. We need some unnecessary sex scenes ofc here and there: Check. Oh, we can not forget the obligatory gay-character with a tragic story: check. While at it, lets have some racial themes mixed in too. Make sure we have the stereotypical sassy black-woman act going on. And finally to top it off, we need to have FISHSEX. Oh yeah baby, they are gonna love it. Bestiality, hell yeah right? They are gonna eat it up and win us the Oscar.\" I want my 2 hours back please. I don't even care that much about the propaganda, but this movie just sucked so hard I cant believe I watched it all the way till the end. And nudity? Sure whatever, if it fits with the context no problem. Might even make the movie better. Here it's totally unnecessary and just feels weird. I have lost all respect for Del Toro with this crap. He is the most overrated director of our time. This movie should have bombed so hard. Can't believe how brainwashed critics are these days."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Oppressively dark with lots of sex-stuff, Guillermo really put the \"adult\" in adult fairy tale on this one."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "This movie is a beautiful paradox --- a wolf in sheep's clothing.I adore Guillermo del Toro's work, but it appears in this case as he is writer/story creator/director, that his angers have melted his own fabric.Parts of this movie are really mind-blowingly beautiful ---The intro (wow what imagery!!!) whether-or-not you think it works, the lady's complexity, her buddy, and the monster's skin and movements ( and breathing in that suit... which doesn't look like a suit to me ), the art throughout the movie in drawings // cinematography // set dressing  ...  leaves me breathless, the acting and care to echo the look of the original monster...  Or to be more exact:  Doug Jones acting as the monster, Sally Hawkins soulful mute, Octavia Spencer's perfectly timed humor, Michael Stuhlbarg's subtle inner conflictions ... Richard Jenkins, well, I just love watching his acting ......  the love.  Two people - beings - getting together because they get each other.BUT :  and it's a big but  :[ spoiler alert ]Del Toro writes-in such a livid attack on America ( the US ) and the American Military, along with questionable points of view -- RE: the sex scenes on mental desire for rape (and actual minutes of burning film with its play-reenactment), and through-out the film specifically outlining the American military and all white Americans as cruel, unjust, and selfish, to the tenth power/squared/cubed... !!!!!!Yes - there was sexism, racism, and a whole bunch of bad stuff  ( mafia... ) -  there still is in this world.Google \"racism in Mexico\".  Try \"white Irish treated as apes in America 1800s\".Even Malcolm X noted racism is the black-white issue in the US - but religion was the culprit of overseas (reference Alex Haley's \"Malcolm X\").But it was highlighted as the *only* way of life for these 2-3 people - it was the gay man, the mute girl, and the black community, against the selfish white American Military and ignorant white American store keeper.This is a fable, \"the creature from the black lagoon\" -- not : the creature vs selfish white United States.It just slowly twists and twists that point --- and leaves me with a what-the-heck-is-this-film-about bad taste after viewing.So gorgeous -- and so ....  eeeech  ....Ummmm.... what does that have to do with the creature from the lagoon?And okay -- you want to deal with the racism at the time -- show it in all its colors (pun intended) : the Irish being treated as apes and not given jobs, the \"whites\" who did stand up for equality and weren't gay or mute, the Military people that fought for our country to be what it is:  free, so we can then duke out the further freedoms of the present day for women's rights, men's rights, animal/land/building rights and you name it....HE is allowed to do films here -- because it's America !!!Del Toro has a lot of anger spatting out in this film, in one sided ways.I wish there were ways to click and say \"here here!!\" to Rex Reed's review...  I saw the movie and a dear friend and I can totally understand what he is talking about.  Unfortunately he might be so overwhelmed with its problems (been there myself if that is the case) that some points which make this movie a miss are not noted as well as some points which make it a win, perhaps under Reed's shock and questioning of how so many adore.I can see why people love this -- what a gorgeous film...  What a beautiful joining and complexity of mutual love.But a political hatred spews forth..  the wolf in sheep's clothing, melting a gem."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "This film is the standard bearer for inaccurate movie reviews. The artsy crafty Harvard Square crowd rate it 80-85 or 90 approval rating. Its the type of film making they dissected in college. As for the real world, it sucks ! Let me make a profitable movie. I'll start with a plain looking mute who supports herself scrubbing floors. Although she frequently masterbates, she has a heart of gold. She feels badly for a Black Lagoon look a like who is being held captive by the U.S. military. She arranges for the creature to escape. I could go on but its rubbish. If you want to drop $8-12 dollars and pretend you are an intellectual, go for it . Another choice is take that $$$ , but yourself a sub sandwich and watch the Breaking Bad marathon on AMC"}], "recommendations": ["sanctum", "swiss_army_man", "children_of_men", "the_counselor", "shadow_in_the_cloud", "the_lobster", "fifty_shades_darker", "fifty_shades_of_grey", "fifty_shades_freed", "the_wolf_of_wall_street", "the_power_of_the_dog", "colossal", "noah", "bird_box", "vivarium", "slumdog_millionaire", "district_9", "the_twilight_saga_breaking_dawn_part_1", "knock_at_the_cabin", "the_grey", "splice", "code_8", "wonder_woman_1984", "the_old_guard", "midsommar"]}
