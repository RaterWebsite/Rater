Someone did, and lost it all! Sex obsessed German Born writer, producer, director Marc Foster is no stranger to making movies that lose massive amounts of money (Stay\u201905 - Machinegun Preacher\u201911). Here, he seems more interested in padding out time by creating a myriad of overlong, experimental ways to illustrate what a sight-impaired person may (or may not) see. His leading characters are an unlikeable married couple (she\u2019s blind, he\u2019s the \u2018carer\u2019) who seem only interested in taunting each other in demeaning ways. Along the way they spend some time with other sexually weird family members - this ends up inducing further ways to seriously unhinge each other. As this rather nasty obscene mess progresses - it becomes increasingly difficult to find many redeeming qualities, situations, or someone to humanely identify with (the husband, even with his character defects comes across as the more balanced!) Without offering the audience many logical explanations to ponder \u2013 the majority of viewers simply give up and long for an end to the torture (see the many international reviews).  Only the over emotional or those who like to make excuses for bad writing would get much satisfaction from this tosh. A waste of near two Hrs and a lot of money - with pretty pictures not atoning for a weak script.  Yet another example of Foxtel classifiers getting it wrong \u2013 an American R (deservedly so) played as an Aussie M. Who trains these (possibly desensitized staff?)  Viewers require supplied information they can trust - to effectively evaluate content."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "A solid idea with good direction and good performances by Lively and Clark but beyond that, the story is weak, it feels like it doesn't know what it wants to be.
