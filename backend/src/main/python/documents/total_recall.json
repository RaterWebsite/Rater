For a factory worker named Douglas Quaid, even though he's got a beautiful wife who he loves, the mind-trip sounds like the perfect vacation from his frustrating life - real memories of life as a super-spy might be just what he needs. But when the procedure goes horribly wrong, Quaid becomes a hunted man. Finding himself on the run from the police - controlled by Chancellor Cohaagen, the leader of the free world - Quaid teams up with a rebel fighter to find the head of the underground resistance and stop Cohaagen. The line between fantasy and reality gets blurred and the fate of his world hangs in the balance as Quaid discovers his true identity, his true love, and his true fate.", "releaseYear": "2012", "mpaaRating": "PG-13", "imageUrl": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/fucmGeZYM4yzqJUnDTc4pKQNCej.jpg", "categories": {"plot": 7.190476190476191, "acting": 5.833333333333333, "ending": 8.4, "soundtrack": 5.0, "cinematography": 10.0, "familyFriendly": 6.0, "funny": 7.0, "action": 6.666666666666667}, "reviews": [{"rating": "10", "text": "Philip K.

The film isn\u2019t deep but it is fun with suspense, action, and twists. The way the future is realized is creative and clever and easily a highlight of the film. Total Recall could\u2019ve been more if the film had embraced the concept of the recall machine and used it to raise moral and ethical questions but instead it just devolves into a straightforward action movie.

The story is well written, and you always ask yourself, what is real right now, even in the end. The sci fi setting is perfect and they made mars and the atmosphere great. Arnie is Arnie and has a lot of charisma, Sharon Stone is not only beautiful, but impresses also as a unclear personality. Michael Ironside is a perfect bad guy. The action was fortunately no exaggerated like in some of the movies of Arnie, so I could immerse in the movie better. Also the special effects were great at that time and today you can still watch them. -> Arnie was not so successful because of his body or only because of Terminator.

Stuffed with decent special effects and a memorable plot, Total Recall remains fun viewing."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Total Recall is **** and total fun. Never count it as genius work, but under Paul Verhoeven's direction it never loses its DNA as sci-fi classic."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "his version of Total Recall depicts a universe that has been destroyed by chemical warfare, and has left only two pockets of civilization that are flourishing. The more powerful country, which is called The United Federation of Britain is an  evil government trying to dominate the other populated area, aptly called The Colony, which seems to be located in Australia but looks more like overpopulated sections of Manila or Shanghai with a heavily Asian population. The Federation with its sophisticated technology wants to dominate and enslave the downtrodden Asians. The two populations are connected by a 17-minute train ride that takes them through the core of the earth. Colin Farrell, as Douglas Quaid or agent Carl Hauser, has to be paranoid throughout most of the film, which he does very well. He also has to be confused, disbelieving, and besides questioning the conflicting stories everyone keeps telling him about who he really is, he even has to doubt his own version of reality. He can't trust his own wife, Lori (Kate Beckinsale), an agent who was sent to play his wife after his memory of being a super-agent was wiped out and replaced with the memory of a mediocre factory worker. Kate Beckinsale has only a few brief scenes where she is the sweet and supportive young wife, and then turns into the villainous super-agent whose combat skills match Farrell's. Her transformation from benign to malevolent happens in one minute, and she is extremely convincing for an actress who is mostly known for her beauty. Douglas Quaid's real love from the previous life that he can't remember is Melina, played by Jessica Biel. She looks like Beckinsale and has the same combat skills, but she is humanized and made more fragile by her love for Quaid. Biel also turns in a surprisingly interesting performance; it seems that director Wiseman brings out the best in his actors, even the ones he's not married to.  Bill Nighy's appearance is  welcome but bewilderingly brief. The chase films are breathless and suspenseful, but there are too many of them and not enough cerebral dialogue to contemplate the basic theme of reality versus illusion. The line, \"an illusion, no matter how convincing, is still just an illusion,\" taken from the original story by Philip K. Dick \"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale,\" points to this theme but never takes us there. The film is violent; bystanders and others are killed off thoughtlessly and needlessly, although the violence is part of the plot depicting a Nazi-like regime that wants to subdue and dominate what they perceive to be an inferior race. The invading chancellor, Cohaagen, played by Bryan Cranston, is a British Hitler, and his murderous armies are mostly robots, which preempts any ethical considerations of how you get tens of thousands of troops to do the bidding of one lunatic dictator. The theories about what motivated the sadistic violence of the real Nazis are still being debated"}, {"rating": "4", "text": "The acting was dreadful, the special effects were pathetic, and the action sequences were laughable. Not only that but the mutant stuff was a bit much. Mediocre film at best."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "The original is it a dream or not film, Total Recall is yet another science fiction classic from director Paul Verhoeven. He knows how to make objectively fun films that are essentially the cinematic equivalent of wrestling. Loud, dumb, and obviously scripted, but since both he and the audience are in on the gag, it is fun to watch. Pairing this with a ripped and confused Arnold Schwarzenegger and a story based upon a short story from Philip K. Dick, you just know this is about to be an excellent watch. In many ways, it feels akin to Dune due to the obsession with control here on a distant planet, though in Total Recall it is air. Starring Schwarzenegger as Douglas Quaid, the film shows him as a relatively normal man married to Lori (Sharon Stone). However, as he goes to a company called Rekall, that allows people to pay to have memories implanted in their mind, things go haywire for him. Choosing to go to Mars and to become a secret agent, the route the film takes is ultimately up to the viewer. One side can claim it was all a part of the dream, but one that he began to believe. The other can claim that it is all true. He came to before the memory was implanted and after they had discovered he had his mind wiped due to the secrets he held from his time as a Mars Intelligence Officer that could threaten Vilos Cohaagen's (Ronny Cox) control over the air on Mars.In many ways, Verhoeven reminds me of a more ambitious and unhinged version of David Cronenberg. Both are obsessed with constant depictions of sex and violence in their films, yet take different approaches to them. Verhoeven is more tongue-in-cheek, whereas Cronenberg is more serious. Yet, both share a similarity: inventiveness. From the gadgets in their films to the world they create, their films are always incredibly imaginative and demand further exploration. This is certainly part of the appeal of watching their films as around every corner is something you never imagined being in a film. This is an incredibly fun experience as a viewer as the weaponry, sets, and the world as a whole are so intricately designed that it makes it all seem real. Every detail is accounted for, even when the plot may become a little too odd to bear. This is a world that is always available to be explored and is a fun journey to be on throughout.Yet, what this film thrives on is paranoia. With Douglas constantly told his true identity is Carl Hauser and that this is all a dream, he has no idea how to respond and neither does the audience. It is hard to pin down what is and is not real as things seem to be too finely put together by Hauser to not be a setup and things go too closely to what he signed up for with Rekall. Yet, other moments show that it is definitely not a dream with people turning against him or remembering him. Of course, that may be the very point. Total Recall walks a fine line between both options, but what is clear is the tension and paranoia this balance creates. It is excellent for entertainment purposes and really keeps you on edge as you try to figure out, scene-by-scene, what is really happening or what could be an implant.An area of complaint for this film would definitely be the acting, which always a lot to be desired. Though, it may just be a trait of Paul Verhoeven films at this point. Inherently satirical in tone and style, the acting seems surreal with it simultaneously being unconvincing and overacted. This is a mainstay quality in many Verhoeven films with the actors seemingly in on the satirical tone of the film by playing their characters less than seriously. It is always jarring, especially with Arnold's constant one-liners littered throughout this film also contributing to this general feeling, but somehow thoroughly appealing to watch unfold at all times.In watching Paul Verhoeven's filmography one thing, aside from the violence and sex, becomes immediately clear. Many of his female protagonists are quite similar and what I would like to categorize as the \"Verhoeven Woman\". If Howard Hawks can have his own female cliche, I think Verhoeven definitely deserves some credit for his own cliche. With Lori (Sharon Stone) - Douglas' apparent wife - and Melina (Rachel Ticotin) - Douglas' apparent lover -  Total Recall introduces two Verhoeven women. Both women are overtly sexual and entirely objectified throughout. They ooze sex appeal and the film plays up this sexuality with both wearing greatly revealing clothing and constantly trying to engage Douglas in sex. Yet, this sexuality is always juxtaposed by Verhoeven with complete empowerment. Though these women may be agents forced to sleep with their marks or hookers who both suffer from the male gaze, they are completely capable and able to function on their own. Lori is a ball busting agent in Douglas' world and is more than capable of holding her own. She even skillfully takes down Douglas as any man with her training would be able to do."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Ordinary fighter of the 90th years.

TOTAL RECALL is a sci-fi action thriller and it isn't very good. The main villain who is Cohaagen played by Ronny Cox is about as intimidating as a teletubby. Michael Ironside was okay but not brilliant and Sharon Stone was excellent giving what crap story she had to work with and she looked beautiful. All the mutants were ridiculous, hideous and brought no positivity to the film especially the woman with 3 boobs as that's laughable , disturbing, cheesey and stupid. The action scenes were not great and the only two positive things in the whole movie was Sharon Stone and the blood. The rest of the movie including more or less all the characters, the acting and the action scenes felt awful and so did the fact the mutants drink in a bar on Mars.

It is violent and stylish. This has to be one of the best futuristic thrillers, it is exciting from beginning to end with lots of charm and well, go watch it now! There are moments reminiscent of The Matrix (1999) with the coloured pills and questions about what is reality. Also Arnold has a similar path to \u2018The One\u2019. It\u2019s also very reminiscent of the Red Faction games because of the drilling, the rebellion and the awesome Mars cars! The only real downside is that the fighting is not very good, it\u2019s badly shot and choreographed. A minor issue."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "The plot and concept are brilliant.

The political themes also seem a bit relevant in today's context, and may forshadow future issues in space colonization, and maybe colonization altogether. Action's nice. Sadly, some effects, once oscar winning, haven't held up over time. If today's FX were available back then, and the disturbing, bio-freaky parts kept to a minimum, this film would be damn near perfect, and it would get a nine.
