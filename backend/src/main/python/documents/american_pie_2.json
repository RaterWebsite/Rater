As it turns out, whether that will happen or not has a lot to do with the girls. Between the wild parties, outrageous revelations and yes, a trip to band camp, they discover that times change and people change, but in the end, it's all about sticking together.", "releaseYear": "2001", "mpaaRating": "R", "imageUrl": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/854ZZxXdeabAs90mrV72NqShJqR.jpg", "categories": {"plot": 8.461538461538462, "acting": 8.88888888888889, "ending": 9.0, "soundtrack": 8.0, "cinematography": 5.0, "familyFriendly": 3.0, "funny": 6.705882352941177, "action": 6.0}, "reviews": [{"rating": "6", "text": "Same crew.

The characters continue to be developed in the right direction, the producers take a step up in the soundtrack department, and the plot line is a pleasant change of pace from the original.

This sequel hasn't change at all it's fresh not to mention the four leads can pull of to make these characters  still the same. After their first year at college, the guys reunite for another summer of fun. Jim (Jason Biggs) unexpectedly gets a call from Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) who's going to visit him, he doesn't want to screw it up like he did last time trying to get with her, so he lets his prom date Michele (Alyson Hannigan) help him be better at sex. Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Vicky (Tara Reid)  find themselves in a weird situation after they broken up for a year will they be friends or get back together? Oz (Chris Klein) is surviving this long distance relationship with Heather (Mena Suvari). Meanwhile, Stifler (Sean William Scott) hates Finch for (Eddie Kaye Thomas) banging his mom. Is better than the first one? Does it really matter? It is an original sequel that Adam Herz does a fine job keeping the soul of the film not to mention that he keeps the characters and makes it fresh again.

This movie was raunchy yet hilarious. I thought that all the charecters had their moments (some more than others). I went to see this movie with my friend's 48-year-old mom and even she was on the floor laughing. I think that Jason Biggs has large marbles for some of those scenes. Seann William Scott, although incrediably rude, was the best comedic wise. All of the charecters were back in the movie and it was ten times better than the first. AM2 is a must see. Hey marc.
