      "text": "I`m usually not a big fan of horror films, but \"The Boy\" was worth all the scary parts. I wasn`t actually expecting much from this film as I`d seen the trailer earlier, but as soon as I saw it, I took my words back. It is a gripping film, which has a thought-provoking plot. The plot is in my point of view very interesting. There`s a nanny Greta who has to take care of a life-sized doll, she also has a strict schedule. The doll starts to move himself and Greta believes he`s alive. The film has an unexpected ending. I liked that there wasn`t used almost any stunts, special effects and overall it wasn`t very violent. The script is clever and moving, too. Altough this film is a bit similar to many other scary movies,  it`s still a convincing story. I`m not interested in light-hearted films, such as most of the romantic comedys etc. Overall, \"The Boy\" is in my opinion powerful and gripping. I recommend it wholeheartedly to everyone."

      "text": "When a nanny meets a boy who is a weird toy.\r So this is the other 'The Boy'. The last year film was a thriller-drama, but this is a horror-mystery. It feels like watching a classic horror film, especially because of the English atmosphere and the house where it was shot. A young American woman named Greta, takes up a nanny job in England to escape from the troubled relationship with her boyfriend. She discovers the boy she has to look out is a doll and later she observes a series of strange events that leads her to find out the truth. The dark secret comes out and that's the film.\r A limited cast film. The suspense was the key to the story narrating successfully. So I expected a big twist at the end, but it was a decent one and the overall film was just above average. The atmosphere was creepy, and then it weakened as the development was decelerated going to the second and the final act. Until the twist, it was good and after that a bit disappointing. Not because of the bad conclusion, but comparing it with the rest, especially after the anticipation it created in us, that end part looked so small and simple. Good film to watch for once, but like the most of the horror films, it's fallen short to get my thumbs up.\r 6/10"

      "text": "\"The Boy\" benefits from atmospheric visual, hissing audio and twisting narrative to make it more alive\r There's an appeal on how the movie creates an expectation to what kind of horror it may present, then turns it around with playful change in direction. It might not be all too shocking or innovative, yet the clever shift coupled with nice backdrop of quaint village setting serve as a nice foray into mystery thriller. It does however, possesses occasional conflicting tones that might undermine the tension from its enigmatic theme.\r Greta (Lauren Cohen) is offered a job on rural English and it comes as a surprise to her that the job entailed is much stranger than she previously thought. While this might seem like a deal-breaker, the money is good enough to make her stick around. After a short moment there she finds strange occurrences happening to her, some of which are alarmingly eerie.\r The movie is at its best when it provides a mysterious vibe. It makes audience wonder whether this is a supernatural haunting, a psychological breakdown or sinister curse. The visual for \"The Boy\" itself is ominously creepy while the audio plays a good role in creating the suspense. It's often the visual and audio clues that create a lingering sense of curiosity, perhaps even more effective than some of its actual scares.\r Its flaws reside on the tired occurrences of \"Is it a dream?\" gimmick, which accompanied by a couple of lackluster jump scares. This is also a movie with a small cast, while the actors perform appropriately for most parts, there are some moments where the change of tone seems too jarring and might even ruin the immersion.\r A few hiccups from the jolting pace aside, \"The Boy\" has assortments of amusing tricks and mysteriously creepy production to play with delightful horror."

      "text": "This film is one of the dumbest, if not the dumbest horror movie(s) I've ever seen. It takes an interesting, if slightly well worn premise and robs it of all possible drama and suspense. For approximately three-quarters of its run-time watching The Boy is the cinematic equivalent of watching paint dry. Moments that should be suspenseful are either dull, or worse, hilarious.\r Then there's \"the twist.\" I put it in quotes because a twist is supposed to have its roots in the story. When you re-watch the film, you should be able to sense the foreshadowing and see the breadcrumbs leading up to the reveal. The \"twist\" in The Boy is less of a twist and more of a non-sequitur. It makes no sense in the context of the narrative, creating a ton of plot holes, and worse, it's lazy. Throw Scooby-Doo, Clue: The Movie, and Annabelle together in a blender and you have this joke of a horror film. The only reason it's getting a 1 from me and not a 0 is that the chemistry between the two main leads is pretty nice. But it's still not a good enough reason to see this trash. Seriously, save your money."

      "text": "Not since last year's generic exorcism flick The Vatican Tapes have I had such low expectations for a movie. Its January release date, unflattering trailer, and awful director (William Brent Bell, director of The Devil Inside and Stay Alive) seemed to be a recipe for disaster. Maybe it's because my expectations were so low, but The Boy is actually a halfway-decent January thriller. The Boy is about an American woman, Greta, who becomes a nanny for a boy named Brahms whose parents will be away for a few months. What Greta comes to find out is that Brahms is actually a life-sized porcelain doll that is used to replace the real Brahms who died in a fire when he was 8. A list of rules is created for Greta to follow, and increasingly disturbing events start happening when she does not follow those rules. The enormous manor that she resides in calls to mind the mansion from The Innocents, creating an interesting setting for the film. As the film progresses, Greta does begin following the rules and treats the doll like a real boy, and it is pretty creepy seeing how the doll can mentally control her in that way. The plot itself is rather thing, specifically during the second act. There is an abusive husband sub-plot thrown into the film like last year's disappointing Sinister 2, but instead of being ridiculously over-the-top like that movie, the side plot actually does serve some relevance in The Boy and is believable enough. It provides a reason for why Greta becomes so attached to Brahms. The big twist at the end will divide viewers, but I thought it served the rest of the movie well. It is revealed that Brahms actually survived the fire and has been living in the walls ever since the incident, and the parents committed suicide and left Greta for Brahms. The fact that he's always in the walls listening and watching everything creates a creepy atmosphere. The Boy certainly won't blow anyone's minds, but it is a decent thriller that should give you an excuse to go out to the cinema in January."

      "text": "To escape an abusive relationship, Greta (Lauren Cohan) moves from America to rural England, finding a position as a caregiver for a wealthy couple's child.  Only after she is at their large manor do they reveal the quote-unquote child, Brahms, is in fact a life-sized porcelain doll, a representation of the troubled son they lost in a fire 20 years ago.  Greta, left alone when the husband and wife go on holiday, is instructed to adhere to a strict routine, including feeding, playing music for, and reading stories to her charge, whom she slowly begins to suspect may be more than just a pacifying toy for her elderly and grieving employers.  This is a small, but creepy, entertaining, and well-told mystery with extremely handsome production design and a sympathetic lead performance by Cohan.  William Brent Bell is a poorly regarded director due to the mediocre video-game slasher Stay Alive and the godawful found-footage film The Devil Inside, but in a surprise twist, he proves rather adept at emulating the this-old-house atmosphere and slowly burning suspense of a film such as The Changeling."

Director William Brent Bell offers few moments of horror to satisfy fans of the genre, but the majority of the tension of the film is based on jump-scares and frights common in the world of horror, making us question Could not have been better with a development more coherent?\r Lauren Cohan is \"Greta\" a young American teenager who escapes from a tortuous relationship and takes a baby-sitting job in a village far away from society and looking gloomy, as soon as she accepts the job, should already know that Brahms should receive a kiss goodnight  and must take care not to break or a single rule.\r After the explanations and others. Greta attempts to understand parents, and with the exception of Malcolm (Rupert Evans), she starts a single transition with the strange doll, where at the end unusually understands and follows the game in a natural and comprehensive way.\r This installment, is apparently a prospect of lean mixture between the so scary \"Annabelle\" (in matters of the doll) and the 2006 film \"When a Stranger Calls\" (in matters of work babysitting), we often see references of not only these two tapes, also from his previous project \"The Devil Inside\".\r From there, the film takes a couple of unnecessary turns and for fans of the horror the end despite breaking schemes of the genre, it is stupid and irrational, wasting the few merits as until then had managed to raise.\r But considering its classification PG -13 and what it could offer us, we all knew that this was not going to make the best horror film of the year but could reach the label \" The Best and Original Horror Film of 2016 , to the date\".  Cohan performance is uneven, the first hour is tortuous and tense and fails her fully know what happens , unfortunately like all horror movies today , the real excitement starts in the last half hour where the film takes a turn I look that even innovative and irreproachable, also feels like a disappointment."

      "text": "It's got some interesting ideas floating around, but fails to capitalize on any of them with scares. It's one of those boring horror flicks where you're actually waiting around for something to happen. While you're left waiting around it toys around with themes of abuse and gives us overly long shots staring at a doll that's appearance lost it's unsettling nature early on.\r Despite being one of the more unique and weird mainstream horror movies to come out in a long time, it ultimately still feels overly familiar. Plenty of it's scare tactics are borrowed so that when it finally does get around to trying to freak you out it has no effect. There's a pretty great twist near the end that also ends up being borrowed from another movie. I can't tell you what movie that is though, because it would spoil things. That twist is one of the few things the movie has going for it.\r There's just not much happening here. They tried to go for a more personal, dramatic side of things and as a result left out the scares. It also doesn't help that they never manage to actually say anything on the topic of abusive relationships. They really needed to focus on the actual horror.\r However just how scary would a haunted/possessed doll actually be? Perhaps a campier route would have made for a better movie. At least then we could have gotten some laughs from the material. Of course you may still get those anyway. The person I watched it with found it very funny. However they also found the thing more watchable than I did.\r It is actually very watchable. The question is, why would you? While the genre isn't exactly brimming with haunted doll movies, and The Boy does manage to tower over Annabelle as far as quality goes (Annabelle might have actually been scarier), this just isn't a good horror flick.\r It touches on some interesting themes, has a nice twist, and didn't cut out the (totally PG) shower scene like The Forest did, but none of that makes it worth watching. It's downright boring for the majority of it's running time. There are plenty of worse options out there, but you are still better off skipping this babysitting misadventure.\r 4.8/10"

I can congratulate it on having nearly no gore (a completely boring and irrelevant character gets stabbed in the neck by a piece of ceramic, and that is it, no joke), and trying to focus on the psychological aspect of horror, one of the reasons I enjoyed 'The Babadook' so much, however it didn't do it nearly as well as 'The Babadook'. There were a couple of FNAF level jumpscares and, I will admit, some very shady scenes, notably the ones in which Brahms head suddenly turns as Greta tries to move him, and when his parents drown themselves. Now, if the rest of the film had done that, I probably would have enjoyed it A LOT more, but it didn't . So my score is a 5: 5 for interesting ideas (I thought the plot twist was actually fairly good), but I can't give it any more than that because of how laughably it was performed.\r The entire horror genre is so saturated now that it's kinda hard to come up with something original. But you tried William, you tried.\r So, William Brent Bell's other AAA film (or at least an attempt on Triple A), 'The Devil Inside' (I haven't seen it) is rated worse than this piece of crap on ImDB. So at least he improved... by 1.2 stars.\r In short, forget about this movie and everything I said and go watch Child's Play."

      "text": "To get ready for it's superior sequel I rewatched this overly mediocre but ultimately disappointing genre entry that liberally borrows from other films including the much better under watched gem \"housebound\". The film centers on a young woman leaving an abusive relationship who ends up accepting a position in the Englush countryside as a nanny. Soon after arriving she discovers that she'll be watching a doll named Brahms. At first she thinks it's humorous but than feels like she's taking advantage of them. But strange things begin to happen leaving her wondering if the doll is alive. The movie is well shot with some amusing nightmare sequences. William Brent Bell of the dumb but fun Stay Alive builds a mildly effective atmosphere but because it's so misleading the end result is disappointing and only marginally entertaining. The main characters soap opera back story feels for ed as well. It all culminates in a fun but disappointing finale. The end result is another forgettable but somewhat entertaining horror flick."

      "text": "This is a dumb and uneventful horror movie. The premise is nonsensical, and the movie is cumbersome and pointless. The acting is not great, the movie looks really bland, and the score is also cliche. There is nothing special about this movie. In fact, it is so unspecial that I fell asleep at the 40 min mark, woke up 20 mins later and did not feel like I had missed anything. Skip this one, just watch some other doll horror movie."

      "text": "Cast members actually used the doll (\"Brahms\") to prank each other on the set. On one occasion, one of the cast members propped the doll up outside of the other actor's bathroom in their trailer to scare them. Upon seeing this, they hurled the doll outside of their trailer and the crew had to repair it and make a replacement doll."
