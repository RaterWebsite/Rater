      "text": "Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver on its own is a mediocre/forgettable film with thin characters but it is a major improvement over the first film. The cast who somewhat captures the spirit of the cast from the comics works well off each other and is given a story to participate in this time. The group using their powers to stop a bad guy provides a more engaging film than the last one when the film isn\u2019t getting bogged down in goofy antics and a generic romance plot. This isn\u2019t a good superhero movie being a little corny especially given where Marvel movies are at now but there have been far worse especially from its own franchise. While it remains to be seen how the reboot will fare at least we have FF movie that kind of works."

Time to get on with my opinion. I actually found this movie to be way better than the first.\r The cinematography was good, the sets were good, the acting was decent, the storyline was well-paced, the CGI were great, and the action sequences were also great. That's it for the good.\r The dialogue was rushed, and the storytelling was weak. That was it.\r Overall, it isn't the best marvel adaptation of the comics, but it is way better than the first as one of the most interesting superhero movies.\r 6/10"

Fantastic 4: Rise-Of The Silver Surfer is an interesting film but screenwriters Mark Frost and Don Payne at least keep the film going and keeps us interested with the story and not make it boring like the last one. The franchise still  goes in it care-free direction, but it does something that the first one hasn't done yet and that is entertaining enough, the first one wasn't entertaining it just gave us a cheesy super hero story and mindless action sequences it was boring. Hack du-jour Tim Story has returned to direct, Story gives us non accurate action sequences but he actually does not make the fun invisible, he actually  goes CGI crazy delivering scene after scene. But at this at this point he should just make comedies instead, he does not how know this  action genre at all. The comedic timing was off and it didn't work. The villain is weak the only reason he is there is just trying to take the team down that's the only reason the character has no motivation.  The cast does have some chemistry, that's what makes the movies watchable. After defeating Von Doom, the Fantastic Four can really enjoy life more. All four are now comfortable with their new powers. The Thing and Johnny Storm now get along with each other, and Sue Storm is now planning to be Mrs. Fantastic. Galactus, an evil creature in space, has decided that Earth is it's new target, and sends the Silver Surfer to destroy it. Reed Richards and his team must now work together to capture this surfer, and even must now team up with one individual who they didn't expect to help. Grade C+"

Even Doom looks and acts more like his comic counterpart (most of the time.) However, there are too many times when the dialogue is a bit too cartoony, trying too hard to sound like the comic.\r While the plot is a good one, its execution was poor and again, underwhelming. While I get why they didn't make Galactus a big purple guy, they completely messed by making him look like a space storm, also Doom hogging the spotlight didn't help.\r I did like the Silver Surfer. He looked, acted and sounded exactly as I expected he would. A shame that his character is over shadowed by almost everything else.\r Overall:\rF4RotSS is in my opinion a marginal improvement on the first movie. It's allot more fun to watch with better effects and action. But also some silly dialogue and wasted plot opportunities do make the movie feel a bit underwhelming."

      "text": "Be careful what you wish for, you may get it\u2026\r For non comic book fans over the age of 13, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is a tedious, incoherent bore. For comic book fans of any age, it is an atrocity - the cinematic desecration of one of the most storied and beloved of Marvel comic book epics. It reduces iconic characters to soulless special effects and turns one of the most ominous and dangerous of all villains into an interplanetary storm cloud. The action, of which there is little, is predictable and unexciting. The so-called \"drama,\" of which there is far too much, is painful. Soap opera writers would be embarrassed to script such drivel. Then there's the overlay of \"comedy,\" which is intended to reflect the superheroes' comic book origins, except it's not funny and it makes the Fantastic Four seem more like the Four Stooges than a quartet of world saviors. For a story that has been kicking around in one form or another in Hollywood for 30 years (at one point, it was to have starred Olivia Newton-John as the Silver Surfer's girlfriend), it's discouraging that this is the best the filmmakers could divine.\r Bring on Galactus, I advised during my review of the underwhelming first Fantastic Four movie. Well, they brought him on and promptly dissed him. He's not much of a presence in the film, always hovering out of sight if not entirely out of mind. And when it comes time for the big \"reveal,\" the word \"underwhelming\" doesn't do the experience justice. Granted, the Galactus of the comic books, with his bright purple suit and ridiculous helmet, might have looked a little silly on the big screen, but his stand-in is a huge disappointment. To quote Star Trek: The Motion Picture, which also featured a space cloud heading for Earth: \"Is that all there is? Is there nothing more?\"\r When the movie opens, Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) are trying to get married. But their nuptial plans are interrupted when a celestial traveler called the Silver Surfer (Doug Jones, voice of Laurence Fishburne) arrives at Earth to prepare it as the next meal for his planet devouring master, Galactus. His arrival awakens Dr. Doom (Julian McMahon), who manages through nefarious means to be named the lead scientist on a government project studying the Surfer and his board. Reed, Sue, and the other members of their quartet, Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) and Ben Grimm (Michael Chilkis), find their best efforts to stop the Surfer to be futile, and every time they fail, Galactus looms ever closer.\r Director Tim Story, who also helmed 2005's Fantastic Four, seems convinced that the movie must be pitched to pre-teens. There's something unsettling about a superhero movie carrying a PG rating. There are plenty of special effects but the action sequences (which include a soaring flight past New York skyscrapers and a chase featuring a souped-up Dodge - talk about a product placement!) could have been lifted from a video game and the characterization is atrocious. Story is creating a product and he has lost sight of everything that makes the Fantastic Four beloved by fans. I can't say this is the worst comic book superhero movie to grace the silver screen, but it's in the dregs (and this series hasn't even reached #3 yet).\r The acting is almost uniformly cringe-inducing. If not for his work in Amazing Grace, I would be convinced that Ioan Gruffudd has no talent whatsoever. Jessica Alba makes love to the camera with her looks but no amount of physical beauty can camouflage the fact that she can't act. (The guy sitting next to me kept murmuring, \"She's hot!\" not \"What an actress!\" That, I suppose, is the point.) Nip/Tuck's Julian McMahon froths at the mouth so energetically that one wonders if he has rabies. Stripped of his Shield and trapped under foam and latex, Michael Chilkis comes close to making Ben Grimm a sympathetic figure, until bad jokes get in the way. And Chris Evans is simply annoying, even though he has what comes closest to a character arc.\r This movie is a mess. It's as if the script was cobbled together in a rush then changed during filming. The ending, in addition to being a letdown, is nonsensical. A lot of what happens in the film, including the re-introduction of Dr. Doom, feels completely arbitrary. What does it say about a major motion picture when the Stan Lee cameo is the highlight? (That was the only time when I smiled.) Rise of the Silver Surfer is only 90 minutes long but it seems as protracted and pointless as anything else this summer has had to offer.\r ise of the Silver Surfer is an insult to comic book aficionados and movie lovers alike. Those who know and love the Fantastic Four will curse Tim Story and 20th Century Fox as they leave multiplexes shaking their heads in disgust."

There are some nice beats in the movie, such as Doctor Doom still being a suave badass and some amusing power swapping shenanigans, but overall the film fails to surpass the fun original. The main problems are some really stupid blunders of logic (the Great Wall of China is apparently right next to Shanghai) and the bizarre implementation of the Silver Surfer, which results in an incredibly famous hero minimized to almost nothing. Overall, Rise of the Silver Surfer is a bit of a lame duck."

      "text": "Jeez. Even while fans are still reeling from the mess that was the first film, it was decided to take another part of this fabled comic series and shred that into unrecognizable pieces that leave a pure-rotten taste in your mouth. This second iteration of the film series has the four fighting against the Silver Surfer and his boss, Galactus, before the two can consume Earth and many more planets along the way. But the movie becomes more and more desperate to keep you watching as it goes on. But even then, by the ending you'll be so bored watching a sack of potatoes would keep you more entertained. And there is a big freaking question that is never answered: If the Silver Surfer could take out Galactus all by himself, why didn't he do it earlier? When the idea was prompted, he was all in support of it, but at the start of the movie he wasn't? I suppose that there were some pretty cool scenes in the movie, but if you want to see a flick with a good story, dodge this train-wreck. Comic fans, don't even bother. I can't believe they decided on a second Eragon."

News flash!, comic books aren't meant to be deep (Well most of them), they are meant to be action a bit of comedy and stick to the storyline of the comic book that made them so damn.. well.. fantastic. I really liked some of the stuff they did the merging of powers was cool and i never really had a bored moment in it. However i do have three very big problems with this film 1) Silver Surfer never says.. TO ME MY BOARD!, even though they give him the perfect chance to do it. 2) Galactus is a giant smoke screen and the little we do see of his face is fire? What the hell, I love silver surfer but the possibility of seeing Galactus was what drew me to this movie.. I didn't see him once.. i saw a shadow of his head on Jupiter :S that was about it... very disappointing. 3) Silver Surfer who Galactus gave a tiny bit of his power was able to kill galactus... and yet seemingly survive at the end.... ok cmon now your stretching things.. Galactus would have laughed, with that awesome voice of his, at the pure audacity of such an attempt.. Silver Surfer is meant to beg for Galactuses mercy and then be trapped to earth forever for his treachery... Why Stan lee allowed someone to change this we will never know i guess. Ok other then that i was entertained but severely disappointed at the changes in storyline."

      "text": "Like the prequel it is a solid movie but nowhere near the good MCU movies. Also it uses the characters not well. Believe it or not both the Silver Surfer and his boss (don't know if his name counts as spoiler but will avoid it) have a deep and tragic back story in the comics. They fail to address this here which harms the characters. The boss should be a highlight of the movie and I hope they do it better in the MCU as his appearance is theorized for this phase. The story starts during the weeding ceremony of Susan and Reed Richards when a strange object cause a power blackout. This is just the tip of the iceberg as around the world strange things happen. The titular Silver Surfer has arrived. So starts the story. I say they deliver an interesting story but fail here too. At least they produce not total garbage. It is underwhelming if you know the comics and the impact of the Silver Surfer and his boss. There are countless ways to do this better and transfer this to the screen. It is like going to a good steak house and just take a small salad while not being vegan or vegetarian. The arc with the powers is interesting and well done but meaningless in comparison with the menace. It is like fixing your uniform when you are under heavy enemy attack. It should not be the focus. Also they solve the issue with ease and this cheapens the movie and menace. When Silver Surfers boss is approaching in the comics all the heroes are panicking and you will see real dread even by hardened characters. He is a force of cosmic nature and the number of people that can go toe to toe with him or surpass him includes only the strongest characters aka reality warpers and the stronger god like beings. The characters aka actors deliver a good performance in the movie but cant turn the tide. All characters return and I basically copied my comments from the prequel as it is valid here too. Ioan Gruffudd is excellent as Reed Richards and I can see him become as iconic as the MCU counterparts with better scripts. I am a fan of Jessica Alba since Dark Angel. I like her performance but also think they could use her character better. Sue Storm is an often overlooked powerhouse and this does not change with or without her powers. Chris Evans as Johnny Storm seems now so out of character since he became the embodiment of Captain America and nailed the role. I say he delivers but was destined to become something far greater. Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm is awesome and I like his character development and struggles. Julian McMahon again delivers as actor even when they fail to deliver Dr. Doom. Doug Jones and Laurence Fishbourne are similar. Great performance but weak representation of the Silver Surfer from the comics. I wont and to be fair cant blame the actors. Good performance in a script that needs improvements. The special effects were good back then but there are things that did not win me over. There are things that can be good but not for you like licorice as an easy example. Overall this is not a bad movie but will be fast forgotten."

      "text": "Although i would say this was the better of the two Fantastic 4 movies, it would be much like saying, \" Of the two times i have been stung in the face, this was definitely the most pleasureabe\" or maybe, \"That was the best head-butt to the crotch my nephew has ever given me.\" If this movie was just advertised as your run-of-the mill popcorn flick, it may have been tolerable. But if you're gonna call yourself a 'Marvel' movie and include the likes of The Silver Surfer and especially Galactus, you'd better do it right. First of all, the first quarter of the movie was still just talking. I mean, the 4 already have their powers and the beginning is still devoted to nothingness. When the story (and i use that term loosely) finally gets going, the movie really starts to disappoint. Apparently, the Fantastic 4 aren't nearly as interesting with their original powers so they trade around a little bit. At the end of course this all works out beautifully when the Human Torch (who is made out to be an unbelievably massive tool; 'Flame on' is an understatement) takes everyones powers (including the Thing, who just kinda turns back to a human, ridiculous) and saves the world from planet-eating Galactus (Who is now a cloud? There's gotta be a law against completely and utterly mutilating characters! Such a disappointment.). In fact, the only thing that doesn't make me reach for mouthwash and ginger ale is the Silver Surfer. The effects on him were well done, honestly better than I expected. My suggestion: if you're gonna cast Jessica Alba in a role for your move, consider maybe a role where she doesn't have to do that, that thing that actors and actresses are supposed to do. What's that called again?"

But these special/visual effects we were given are amazing, I was astonished by them. And if you put your full thought into it, it is entertaining, and creative throughout."

      "text": "JUST got back from the midnight showing. Now, I'm biased because the FF are my favorite superheroes, period. But even I have to admit the first one was pretty hum drum. I went into this with a mixture of dread and hope. I have to say, I really, really liked it. To me, this was a proper Fantastic Four movie. About 20 times better than Spider-man 3 for sure. The Silver Surfer, the Fantasticar, Doctor Doom... everything felt so right. It's not nearly as brainless as some critics make it out be. There's genuine warmth between the characters, and there is some growth. In the FF's world, there's no cloud of death hanging over them ala Spider-man that drives their sense of responsibility. Their scientists who go on fun adventures, enjoying their powers and trying not to kill eachother when their familial bonds get to be too much. Their not being hunted and spurned by a world who hates them ala X-men. There's not a lot of pathos, so maybe that makes them seem shallow. But it's not that simple. There are a lot of inter-relationship issues that stem from being a family. It's this, set against the backdrop of all these crazy adventures, that makes the team what they are. The first movie felt sort of forced in places, and didn't have nearly the scale an FF movie should. This movie was much better. I'd like to see more exploring, more strange worlds, etc in a future movie, but this was a step in the right direction. It had more of a global feel. Also, Julian McMahon totally redeemed himself as Doom. He was really cool. If anything, I want to see more adventures of this team now. It was very short. A perfectly paced 90 minutes (which was refreshing after the over-long, sometimes boring Spider-man.) Oh, and the thing that most people are in a tizzy about? Didn't bother me a bit."

      "text": "This movie sucks. The dialog is cheesy, the acting sucks, and the title makes no sense. The silver surfer didn't \"rise\" from anywhere, he came from space. And at the end he destroyed Galactis, which he could have done all along when he was destroying those countless other planets. It wasn't as bad as the first, the special effects were cool, but don't see this movie. At the end they hinted at a sequel, i hope they can bring this series back."
