At least Paltrow and Johansson provided some enjoyment and the hope that the film might continue just that little bit longer. Cheadle also at times outshone Downey's own character. The action scenes were enjoyable though. However, even more annoying than the lacklustre script was the feeling that the ending had suddenly been tacked on and then was over far too soon"

Robert Downey JR is great as usual, the action has been improved and Mickey Rourke is entertaining as the terrible Russian. Even thought there are improvements to the sequel, there are also too many characters in the film and the final action scene is quite anti-climactic. Still a high recommendation to fans of the original"

The first had multiple villains, and the plot is pretty straightforward assuming you were kind enough to leave a little paste uneaten in grade school."

This film follows the same mistakes as The Incredible Hulk but at least the performances where good and the new introduced characters such as War Machine are really likable. A pretty fun but mediocre film."

      "text": "It has all the things first Iron Man film didn't have. And that's not necessarily a good thing. ..Good : RDJ is fantastic as Iron Man and Tony Stark. He has proven himself to be perfect choice in the role in multiple films now, and this is no exception. No matter how ridiculous the screenplay was, he is the last thing wrong with this film. Also, we get introduced to two new characters, Nick Fury and Natasha Romanoff. Their introduction feels very apt for the first Avengers movie which came in 2012. Samuel Jackson and Scarlett Johansson prove to be the perfect choices in the first go. RDJ has a very great chemistry with all the cast members. His sarcastic and a$$holey one liners are damn good. In the entertainment and performance level, there are no complaints. ..Mixed : Even though it was entertaining, it was a total mess. It had a ton of good ideas for a solo Iron Man film, but all of them do not coalesce together to form a solid plot of the film. The plotlines were good, but the final story did not turn out to be so good. I can appreciate what they tried but not what they did. It feels like a misfire. The arc they tried to give to Stark was quite good. But, the screenplay was ridiculous at many parts. We don't feel sorry, neither we sympathize him. Instead, he feels like a gigantic a$$hole, even though he was to be sympathized. ..Bad : It feels like an advertisement for Avengers, rather than an entertaining build up. Studio allowing a very short period of time for making this movie is quite apparent. Whiplash feels as if he would've been a really great villain, but due to ridiculous screenplay, he feels uninteresting. He had motives to stand against Stark, but in the end he feels like a slimy goofball who wants to kill Iron Man to show that he is tough. And the other villain, Justin Hammer, is a blant rival of Iron Man who is a kind of a pu$$y and just a clich\u00e9d villain. I loved Terrence Howard as War Machine. Don Cheadle sucks. When Howard was casted, I felt like I would get a War Machine solo some day, or at least be in a really good role other than being a sidekick to Iron Man. But with Cheadle, I felt that it would be better if they make him just a sidekick and luckily, that's the case till date. ..Conclusion : It's an entertaining mess. You will enjoy RDJ and his one liners, and, the overall charisma that everyone, except Cheadle, bring to the characters they play. But if you expect it to be a solid sequel, it ain't so. Whiplash feels like a wasted villain and Mickie Rourke feels like a wasted talent. He did fine with the material he was given to work with, but it never felt like he was necessary for the role. But the biggest issue would be that it feels like an advertisement of Avengers rather than a build up, and the plotlines not meshing together makes it a disappointment to a certain extent. ..Rating. ..Score : 6.3/10Grade : B"

Well it was not exactly cerebral as The Dark Knight (its Summer opponent of 2008), it was fast-paced and indeed had enough action to fill its run time. I wish I could say the same about the sequel, Iron Man 2. What was a franchise known for its action, is now a dull plot-developing movie. The majority of the movie focused on the foolishness of Robert Downey's character.  Although well-acted, I wish there was more \"Iron Man\" than of Tony Stark.  The final scene of the movie does go back to it comic-book roots with the duo of War Machine & Iron Man, but it feels empty because there was not much to support it. It is an acceptable and somewhat enjoyable blockbuster, but I could not get over the mindless drama and lack of action."

It's a real shame since the first one had some nice moments to it, the film just stays within the constraints of those people who would be satisfied with classifying every no-brain-required movie as \"hey, it's just entertainment\".  Once again it could have more than the sum of its highly expensive parts and give us something other than by-the-book action sequence after sequence.  Stark is pretty much the same except that now he has a bit of angst, but don't worry that's quickly solved by some BS that the writers threw in to wrap things up quite nicely.  Nothing has importance or impact, and I was just waiting for the happy ending that inevitably followed.  The only glimmer of light in the whole movie was Mickey Rourkes and Sam Rockwells performance.  Let's end these superhero movies while we still have some diginity...or take a freakin leap of faith and someone start writing better ones instead."

There are some dorky references to other super heroes, some things that seem like inside jokes to the geeks that think their comics are \"good source material.\" The hero doesn't risk anything, nothing is lost, he's never really threatened by the villains, every problem was resolved easily and required no cleverness. SPOILER: Building a particle accelerator in your basement and creating a new element to fix his heart device is stupid - it's not even a level that Star Trek writers would sink to. Sam Jackson's side plot was distracting and pointless. The jokes were L-A-M-E...like tongue-in-cheek 1960's Batman lame. The only thing I can say good about Iron Man 2 is that Downy Jr. and Rourke are good at what they do. But I have a feeling if they weren't recovering drug addicts, we wouldn't be rooting for a 45 year old alcoholic corporate superhero fighting a 58 year old vodka-drinking villain."

These two guys are supposed to be best friends? Yeah Tony was being a douche, but that doesn't mean you steal one of his suits and proceed to try to beat his ass and tear up his whole damn mansion in the process. It just felt like they needed an action beat, like they said \"Oh hey, it's been x amount of pages since we've had some action to entertain the audience, we need to stick a fight scene in here according to this scriptwriting 101 guide.\" It seemed very forced and unnecessary to me.Justin Hammer was cheesing up the joint and just acting way too goofy.Tony and Pepper's playful banter had turned into a lot of bickering that wasn't that fun to watch.Tony's father had hidden away his secret formula for an amazing new element as... the overhead blueprint for his **** Stark Expo? What the hell, why would anybody... what? That doesn't even make any sense. How would he know that Tony would possess a nifty holographic projector that could strip away the details and reveal this magical wonder element? Why not just write down the formula on a piece of paper, why hide it as the layout for a stupid ass expo? This... this **** stinks.How is Tony's new power source poisoning his blood? The palladium core goes right into his arc reactor, why would this end up in his bloodstream? His bloodstream seems completely segregated from the reactor. Couldn't he just invent some filter between the reactor and his body? He seems good at inventing stuff.At the race track, when Vanko attacks... why don't the security guards just shoot Vanko in the chest with their guns? His exoskeleton doesn't seem to cover his chest, they could shoot him to death.Rourke's Vanko spends most of the second half of the movie in a factory building robots. That's kinda boring, you shouldn't have your main villain squirrelled away that much.The final battle with Vanko was way too short and just involved IM and WM doing some stupid high-five with their repulsors.
