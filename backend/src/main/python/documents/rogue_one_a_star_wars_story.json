      "text": "This is rebellion on a whole new (epic) level. It's a fun and more grittier adventure to the galaxy far, far away.Rogue One; like all the SW-premieres are always a fun event to experience. Fans and non-fans alike collectively get together once again for this space adventure. It's visually a big upgrade from the prequels, and it does to a certain point manage to embrace the original film's charisma. Fun, bright and enjoyable characters is a big trace -- and forget romance! This is a pure war film where companionship is everything. We follow 'Jyn Erso' and the main story is greatly focused on her, but a major letdown is the underdeveloped side-characters. They are all well presented and we get some inside to their personalities; but there's no major background nor development to characters like 'Cassian Andor'. Our main antagonist 'Orson Krennic' is very much the same. But there are some deeper layers to him, but sadly not enough to be considered a complex nor memorable villain. Because of this lack of greater depth to characters; the few emotional moments that does exist could have been even greater, because there are some great ones. The great one-liners from K-2SO is on the other hand very much appreciated, it's great that they really understand the importance of humor in the SW universe.The story that takes place is full of action, as expected -- but more importantly; the characters are the major players here. A great character-filled first act, a more passive & calmer second act, to a stunning and perhaps too massive third act -- that's Rogue One. There're many characters and places involved in this story. All of this made some of the story uneven. It kept going, from places to places, characters to characters and so on; it became an experience that's a bit too far- stretched. It lost that \"wow-factor\". The second act takes a step back and didn't impress me on a personal level. It's okay but nothing really impressive got to me. But I am confident enough to say to all the big SW-fans out there that you will definitely love this film, and yes there are some really impressive action pieces -- but I never got many \"wow moments\". It drags on and lacks a greater long-term stamina when it comes to action. When looking at the CGI; it's a major technological achievement, except for two major CGI characters that look all other than alive. They are impressive to look at; much details, but the way they interact and talk is so fake. Add a non- Williams score that's underwhelming, well the flick got flaws. But other than that I really enjoyed it!It's a good Star Wars movie. Not the best nor the worst. It got its flaws concerning the uneven storytelling and undeveloped side-characters, and some flaws are more serious than other. It's a beautiful story that's partially gritty and it got a stunning visualization of Vader. Add a darker tone, a very satisfying finale and an ending that manages to wrap everything together! That's Rogue One. It's the pure definition of rebellion.*psst don't enter this film expecting much Vader.Personal rating: 82/100 Critical rating: 70/100"

This has some of the absolute best action sequences in any Star Wars film and it actually has what many of the films have lacked, stakes. Through good characters and terrific acting, Rogue One manages to succeed what most prequels fail to do, enhance the impact of later films. I see myself watching A New Hope through a new point of view and I have to say, Gareth Edwards made a Star Wars movie that stands on its own. Yes it's not a perfect movie, but it's a really good movie with minor flaws."

      "text": "The last time the \"Star Wars\" franchise decided it wanted to make prequels... we got outraged fans who lost faith in the iconic franchise. Luckily, Gareth Edwards directs 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story', a title that might put-off some fans, but the movie itself is definitely worth a watch. We meet a young girl named Jyn (Felicity Jones) who had to escape after her father, Galen (Mads Mikkelsen) is informed by Director Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) forces Galen to work on the crafting of the Death Star. After some decade and a half, Jyn meets Rebel Officer Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) and she is informed about the Death Star.She also meets a droid named K-2SO (a very funny Alan Tudyk) whose mannerisms and personality seem unusual, but helpful. They travel from planet to planet to find more clues on how to get the plans to destroy the Death Star, and they also find more characters to come and help. There is so much of this movie to talk about, but a \"Star Wars\" review can be easily spoiled, so I'm just going to summarize my thoughts on the movie. This is a really steady paced, dark and thrilling movie. The third act is one of the best third acts in any \"Star Wars\" movie, ever. The war battle that rages reminded me of the opening battle scene in 'Saving Private Ryan' (1998), obviously not that violent, but for this franchise's standards, it is. There are many familiar faces that return in this movie, most notably, Darth Vader (reprising the voice of James Earl Jones), who only makes two small appearances in this movie. But, they are so great, I cannot elaborate further without spoiling it, so I'll leave it there. This movie, which takes place before the events of 'Star Wars: A New Hope' (1977), really relies mostly on story as opposed to character. You get to know a lot about Jyn, a little bit about Cassian and K-2SO... but the rest are kind of glossed over as far as development goes. Director Gareth Edwards did a capable job of actually making this feel like a \"War\" movie, whereas the other movies were a space-opera spectacle. The first two acts are a little pacey here and there... but that third act is truly one of the best highlights for this entire franchise."

Some of the scenes in Rogue One are some of the best I've ever seen in a Star Wars film. The beginning of the movie however, is muddled and lacks focus. There are too many characters with not enough development, and too many things happening to really get your teeth into. While the second half of the film will blow audiences away, the first feels a little clunky and the re-shooting seems obvious as you watch.Although it has a shaky start, the film is definitely worth watching, especially for Star Wars fans. There is much to enjoy here but it comes with some flaws. If you forgive it for it's pacing and character misfires, this is a solid entry in the franchise."

I guess I can say that I prefer old movies above all else, maybe because of that I hated every frame of it. Before I was going to ROGIU ONE I honestly had no expectations, NO HOPE at all.My GOD. I was gonna cry in the end. That was the movie I was waiting for since \"Empire Strikes Back\". Visually the movie is a masterpiece, way and way better then \"Episode VII\". Battles are breath taking, I dont wanna spoil it that is why I cant go into detail. THIS MOVIE DESCRIBES THE \"WAR\" in STAR WARS. A real war, where everyone SUFFERS, where darkness looms, innocent & evil die, this story shows what we have never seen before.And such an ending, thanks to Gareth Edwards, really I can die in peace now, this movie is the one and one only that almost made me cry, smile, laugh, made me sit on the edge of my seat on the second part.I GUARANTEE YOU, if you love EPISODE 4-5-6 the most, THIS IS THE MOVIE YOU HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR."

      "text": "Rogue One isn\u2019t perfect, but it is a great breath of fresh air for the Star Wars Franchise. The direction feels very different at first, feeling more handheld at not super Star Wars-esque because of its grittier more grounded style, but this is great and works for the film. It ends up making it feel like a real war and struggle for the rebellion and it ends up changing later towards the end in tonal shift and direction to blend into A New Hope.Pacing is a little odd at first, but the first section is interesting enough to keep you very invested, especially with all the character introductions. The second act is a littler quieter and a bit of a lull but still has enough going on and differs itself from the rest of the film to keep it fresh. The last section is an intense all out action masterpiece, and really gives a space feeling of something similar to the end battle of Saving Private Ryan. Characters are well enough written for you to enjoy and like them all, however they are a little underdeveloped for the most part and you end up wanting more from them. This ends up not hindering the film too much since the film is a standalone. This film does carry itself well, it knows when to be dark without over doing it and changes location at a nice rate with a clear understanding of where and what folk are doing.This also the first film where Darth Vader is actually fully terrifying, he is almost like an insanely powerful sci fi MikeMyers. Even thoug he isn\u2019t in it much, his presence is palpable.The good thing about Rogue One also is that it doesn\u2019t try to keep using nostalgia to interest its viewers (which TFA did a lot) but does have plenty of nice little easter eggs.The droid K2SO in the film is also the comic relief of it, but whilst a few jokes hit the mark a lot are unnecessary and too forced in, and there is (like TFA) a lot of cheesy 2016 throwaway jokes just put in there. Disney need to learn to restrain themselves from certain jokes, and when they do put them in they need to understand when to end the joke and how to fully have them come across.Last two complaints, the new score for the film is cheesy and doesn\u2019t fit the film at all, and really takes away from it as a whole sadly. Dubbing John Williams over it would be very cheap, but to be honest it would probably make the film feel more epic and fit more. There is also some questionable CGI characters in the film which just look unnatural in the film but still don\u2019t ruin it too much.Overall, this film diverges enough away from Star Wars to make it feel fresh but also very nicely connects itself to the original trilogy. Action is awesome yet characters are a little underdeveloped, special effects are gorgeous but score is disappointing. It is a tragic war film set in the Star Wars universe, and Gareth Edwards did something brave with what he had.Bravo to you sir.8/10"

      "text": "Rogue One is an amazing movie, but it takes some time to become it. It has an uneven, and somewhat uninteresting beginning, a fun but rather incongruous middle, and a spectacular end. Along the way, it both suffers and benefits from the world in which it's set.Rogue One is a unique journey through a very familiar world. It has everything you'd hope to see in a Star Wars movie - space battles, stormtroopers, new alien races, lovable droids, rogues turned heroes. Yet it still manages to feel fresh and different from the rest. I personally felt that this was one of the film's strengths, that it was something different. However, the film also pays a little too much homage to Star Wars: A New Hope, its immediate successor in the Star Wars chronology. There are several character from the original film who appear in Rogue One, a couple of whom are digitally rendered. It doesn't work. At all. It's rather unsettling to look at, and I'd much prefer they just recast those roles if they're set on using those characters.Once the film builds momentum, it's delightful to watch. The humor is great, the action is thrilling, and there are some genuinely real character moments. Sadly, the film is also punctuated throughout with heavy-handed attempts to inspire (you've never heard the word \"hope\" used so many times in a single screenplay). And there is an evil lair which is laughably on the nose. It couldn't get more stereotypically cartoonish.Despite its faults, Rogue One is a great time. It's definitely worth seeing in the theaters, but be aware: it might be a little intense for young kids."

      "text": "Rogue One is the best Star Wars movie since 1980. The general consensus of last years Force Awakens was that the spirit of the original trilogy returned. However, the problem with Episode VII is in how the spirit is captured identically. In having returned so reverently, the franchise needed to display a willingness to tinker. Enter the newest cinematic addition to Star Wars. Rogue One is a balanced movie of hope and despair. The last Star Wars movie to find this magical balance in tone is The Empire Strikes Back. Likewise, Rogue One finds a unique synergy between old and new. The first anthology Star Wars movie works in its inevitable lead-in to an almost forty-year-old classic with a sense of invigoration. The movie smartly covers up modern filmmaking conventions with amazing throwbacks to the original trilogy. Seventies style facial hair can still be found on the Rebel pilots while a few smart cameos make the Star Wars initiated feel at home. The amount of Star Warsness to the film allows director Gareth Edwards to comfortably recton A New Hope. A problem with Rogue One is how the film can only be best enjoyed by a Star Wars fan. Rogue One is a decent enough war movie. The dogfights are exciting. The characters are charming and funny enough. The overall plot can\u2019t be fully enjoyed without having seen A New Hope. In addition, the cinematic impact the film has on the future of this storied franchise also can't be appreciated by an outsider. Rogue One features the most diverse cast of any Star Wars movie... as well as the franchises more intense scenes. The mentioned scenes make up some of the best moments in a Star Wars movie to date. Rest assured the future of the franchise is in the very capable hands of Disney. Rouge One is how a franchise should make the old relevant."

      "text": "Rogue one is perhaps one of the greatest Star Wars film ever made -but not a great film in itself. I agree character and pacing is a bit off, but I think people forget that Star Wars never really had great character development to begin with but rather great actors giving a really good performance (ie Harrison Ford's lines a lot of his one-liners were ad lib). My personal gripe with this film is probably that a lot of the characters felt a bit tagged on - like the blind dude etc, and some of the choices they do (ie in the ending) feels forced and illogical -and could have been written better in terms of what happens to them. The ending is rather unambiguous and a certain CGI character appears too much and does something at the end for no reason (only to ensure there won't be a sequel). Also Gareth Edwards could've shot some of the action scenes better and give some character's a proper arc which was lacking. Lack of a crawl and insistence of using location cards were a bit off-putting.However Rogue One has the best world building, plot development, costume design, lighting and story flow out of the other Star Wars films. The film doesnt rely on wipes to get to one place to another which is great. Rogue one also have amazing action sequences and impeccable sound design. All the locations feel like real worlds compared to Force Awaken (which felt like small set designs). Although the score lacked more distinguishable motifs, I thought it flowed really well with the action o the films - and more of the traditional motifs were integrated well.  Overall I thought Rogue One was a better Star Wars film than TFA and maybe even ROTJ, only because the world building and action was impeccable."

So while reading these reviews I was beginning to become skeptical myself, they ranted and raved about how the Disney keeps introducing planets and characters that they want us to fall in love with or force upon us and have never heard of. This is a side story all on it's own, so we are going to meet characters that we don't know, we are going to see planets that we haven't seen before, and that is ok.\"Rogue One\" is probably the best Star Wars film since \"The Empire Strikes Back\", it leaves us right where it is supposed to chronologically in the saga. It has you pulling and falling in love with all the characters for the most part. The little cameos that we see here and there are well placed to give you that little nostalgia feeling.If we all remember in \"Episode IV: A New Hope\" where the leader of the Rebel Alliance Mon Mothma says that a lot of people had lost their lives to recover these plans. Well \"Rogue One\" is the story behind what she was talking about.Jyn Erso the daughter of Galen Erso, was played by Felicity Jones, an English actress known for playing the role of Jane Hawking in the film \"The Theory of Everything\" in 2014. I am sure now she will be known as the actress who starred in \"Rogue One\". She played the role with poise and gumption, bringing the character to life with the strength that her character stood for in the saga. We first meet her character at an adult age when she has already been captured by Imperials and is then \"liberated\" by members of the Rebel Alliance. Those Rebels would be Cassian Andor and K-2SO played by Diego Luna and the delightful Alan Tudyk. Diego Luna plays a rough around the edges and very secretive scoundrel role in this film, where you don't know if he is good guy or bad guy, while Alan Tudyk plays his sarcastic and very blunt comedic sidekick that is sure to leave you laughing and begging for more.If you are going to go see this film, keep an open mind that this is a story that we knew little of, and that Disney did a great job bringing this story to life and giving us more of an insight on what the Rebel Alliance went through to overcome the great evil that was the Empire.This movie isn't meant to be compared to any of the other episodes that we have seen in previous years. It is to tell the prequel story of the most beloved Trilogy of all time. So don't go to this film with doubts, go to see this film with the hopes to catch a glimpse of something you have never seen before, there are no preconceptions of what to think, because this is a whole brand new story, so you can take it for what it is for, a wonderfully filmed movie, with characters you can connect with for the first and (spoiler alert) the last time.The film has everything, AT-AT's, AT-ST's, sarcastic droids, Dog Fights, real plot lines and a grand finish! A must see in theaters, don't wait to Redbox this movie, you need to go see it in theaters to appreciate it's full value.I hope this review was helpful, and I hope you enjoy the film as much as I did.Vader is still a beast!-Devin of All Things Nerdy"

The creators right from the start had promised to bring something new to the table and they did deliver. The casting was perfect. The CGI has been remarkable with lots of surprise elements in offer for long time fans of the franchise from the 70s. Although the film delivers in the long run with all Stars Wars action elements ranging from stormtroopers to the  AT act walkers against the rebellion units , there are minor issues with general pacing as the story progresses around with its Death Star plot at instances with poorly timed execution of the characters related to it, bogging it down for viewers. The Force Awakens had an USP with great character execution but on the other hand the action sequences in Rogue One struck the right chord several notches above TFA for the prequel story. It deserves a solid 9."

It's The Dirty Dozen in space with Darth Vader and AT ATs. During the last third of this thing I felt like I could take on the whole Empire myself. It's a flawed masterpiece. Weakest part is the music and some pacing problems in the first act--but it's not weak enough to affect my score."

      "text": "Rogue One is the epic story that follows a small group of rebels that steal the plans to the death star. I really liked the cinematography, special effects, action, and overall scope of this film. It is one of if not the most beautiful looking Star Wars movies. Most of the new characters are really good as well and the performances provided by the various actors. The characters that stood out the most for me are Krennic, K2SO, and Chirrut. I wasn't a huge fan of Saw Gerrera and felt like some of the other characters weren't as memorable as I hoped they'd be. But after thinking about it I think thats the point of the story. This group of rebels ended up risking their lives for the greater good of the galaxy, and sometimes not being remembered after the fact is what happens in war. I only have one other main gripe with the film, and it has to do with a CGI character. I liked the writing and performance of the character I am just unsure that it feels organic enough to fit into the story. Overall these few nitpicks aren't really enough for me to feel the film is flawed because it is amazing in every other front. Especially the final act, oh man was it ever worth it. This is the prequel you are looking for."

Just good enough to stay in \"go watch it eventually\" status.The beginning of the movie planet-hops a bit too much, some characters feel underdeveloped, and the action scenes could've been more interesting.Really fun third act though. Special mention for Donnie Yen and Jiang Wen, they did a great job playing their characters."

I mean, \"The end justifies the mean\" could be used to describe the rebel moves...The ties to the ep III and IV are well made. The use of the CGI was unexpeted but welcomed.All in all, this movie is a must for a Star Wars fan.For non fan, compare it the Saving the Private Ryan with lasers :)"

      "text": "It might be unpopular opinion with some Star Wars fans, but I hate this movie.  I'll explain.Firstly, a lot of what makes Star Wars, Star Wars, is absent.  No Jedi vs Sith light saber fights here.  No Jedi at all actually.  Vader is a fun presence in the movie, while he's on screen for all of 5 minutes in a 2 hour movie, but he's only in it for 5 minutes.  There's a lot of little references to A New Hope, that I'm sure fans enjoyed, but they're pretty forced.Jedi aside, one of my favorite things about the original trilogy was the banter between Leia and Han.  Nothing really resembling that here.  Or the daring getaways in the millennium falcon.... again, not really.What there is here, is a by the numbers simple rebel rebellion war movie, crippled by a need to give constant nostalgic nods to better movies of the past, and a PG-13 rating.  I hear people calling this one \"gritty\".  Compared to what exactly?  Certainly not compared to an actual war movie, like this is doing a poor job of trying to mimic.  Gritty compared to a Disney cartoon?  Well, maybe not even that.  No cussing, no blood, no dark references of any kind... This is a wannabe war movie sanitized for little kids.That's a problem, however, since the first 2 thirds of the movie involves a LOT of standing around talking, nothing happening, with boring characters.  Children will be bored.  Very bored.  Adults who aren't huge Star Wars fans should be bored.  It's a stupid predictable plot, with paper thin characters, and bad dialogue.  Trying to end on a positive note.... There was a good scene with Vader (about 3 minutes long), that I enjoyed, and K-2SO can be pretty funny sometimes.  So, about maybe 10 minutes of good stuff in this 2 hour movie for this guy.  What do I have this at?  A 4?  Thinking about this better, lets lower that down a notch.  A 3.  For the 3 good minutes that had Vader doing cool stuff."

      "text": "Little note: my review will be spoiler-freeHOLY S--T! What I just saw blew me away. What I came out of was \"Star Wars\" at it's best. \"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story\" is, IMHO, now the TRUE best Star Wars film since \"The Empire Strikes Back\". Set before the original \"Star Wars\" from 1977, this film shows us a true WAR in \"Star Wars\" by having spies of the Rebel Alliance go up against the evil Galactic Empire to steal the plans to their original Death Star. And, since Gareth Edwards, the director of this movie, really wanted to deliver a war film set in the Star Wars universe, akin to \"Saving Private Ryan\" and \"Black Hawk Down\", he was telling the truth coming out of what I saw. It really feels like a Star Wars movie in a whole new way. I will admit that I enjoyed \"The Force Awakens\", but, after a while, I've come to realize that while it is watchable, it feels safe in some ways. This one, really showed how original, different and new it was while being familiar when it knew too and it payed off big time in what I consider it's most serious, if not darkest, Star Wars ever. The entire cast of this movie shines. Felicity Jones plays Jyn Erso, our lead hero with strong brashness but such vulnerability you can't help but feel bad for her when you see how things play out for her in the film, especially with her father Galen (played by the always devious yet charming Mads Mikkelsen). Diego Luna puts effort into his role as Cassian Andor and makes it as memorable as his character's arc in the film is. Riz Ahmed really shows how conflicted his character, Bodhi Rook, is as he delivers playing a former Imperial cargo worker now struggling to redeem himself. Donnie Yen,\" and Jiang Wen are awesome as the pair of Force-believing warrior Chirrut Imwe and trigger-happy gun-wielding Baze Malbus. And, Alan Tudyk as the sarcastic reprogrammed droid K-2SO rounds out the cast to help make this movie work in their best way and they all get moments to shine in such iconic ways. Ben Mendohlson really showed his determination playing Orson Krennic in a different kind of villain for \"Star Wars\" to show. Darth Vader when he shows up really shows in this time where the film is set, he really is the Vader everyone grew up with. But, I cannot get off the hook without saying how impressed I am by Forest Whitaker's performance of my most anticipated character from this movie, Saw Gerrera from \"Star Wars: The Clone Wars\". While he was in this movie for more or less of what I expected, Forest Whitaker REALLY got into character as Saw and portrayed him in all the ways he was portrayed when we first saw him in \"The Clone Wars\". Also, if you generational Star Wars fans are hoping for ties to the Prequel Trilogy instead of just the Originals, well you're in luck, as we get appearances of not just characters and actors from the Prequels but also planets from the Prequels as well. We also visit new planets that help expand many parts of the Star Wars mythology such as where people stand in believing the Force and what it took to build the Death Star. Plus, be on the lookout for appearances and mentions of certain characters and ships from \"Star Wars Rebels\", which you can watch on Disney XD, when it returns with new episodes in January. Also, two important characters from the Original Trilogy make a return in some of the most well-made VFX ever put to film. I'm not spoiling who they are, so, you'll just have to watch for yourself. And, you'll feel like you're part of the action especially once you get to the epic space battle in the climax of the movie. Finally, Michael Giacchino really delivered with his score for this movie that really brings out the action and emotional development these characters go through to complete their mission as well as bringing something new to score in \"Star Wars\" while sprinkling familiar scores when needed. Overall, if you're looking for a phenomenal \"Star Wars\" film, \"Rogue One\" is that. It truly delivers on taking huge risks, like abandoning the traditional opening crawl, and finding its place into the \"Star Wars\" universe while remaining a standalone movie that really doesn't need to setup anything for the future of \"Star Wars\". And, that's good. I hope this movie is successful enough to do more riskier Star Wars spinoffs, especially if Episode IX is the last of the core Star Wars saga. I hope you all love this film, because I most certainly did. This film is for all generations of Star Wars fans. Go see it. You'll be glad you did. 5 stars. \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f10/10"

      "text": "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is about as flawed as it is entertaining. With almost documentary-like camerawork, this is the most handheld Star Wars film by far, offering a more grounded and realistic feel, but the dialogue can feel cheesy and cliche at times. Very well shot but also very imperfectly shot, this film looks flat-out gorgeous. The editing can be a little choppy at times though, but that isn\u2019t anywhere near as distracting as the CGI version of Grand Moff Tarkin, as well as some other CGI characters. Which brings me to my biggest gripe - The characters. Likeable, funny, but that\u2019s about it - They lack any depth, background, or proper development, and we aren\u2019t given any reason to care for them. Director Orson Krennic is an extremely weak villain and doesn\u2019t even compare to Darth Vader, who was only in TWO SCENES. This wouldn\u2019t have been as much of a complaint if the rest of the characters were more interesting, but it still would\u2019ve been a stupid choice. The first act of the movie is quite messy, and feels like a series of loosely tied together scenes, jumping from location to location too quick and repetitively. There isn\u2019t really much else for me to say about the rest of the movie apart from the last act, which is a long if not too long action sequence, and although VERY entertaining and brilliantly directed, it has endless cliches and does get repetitive after awhile. Lacking any suspense that the previous Star Wars excelled at, this is a fun, decent ride with incredible effects but it is a very disappointing installment to the Star Wars franchise. I don\u2019t see there being any replay value either. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story gets a 6 out of 10. It\u2019s decent."

Of course the visuals are nicely done, but the action scenes are long and boring as well as the scenes based on dialogs between them. Director Krennic is well played but very one dimensional. Chirrut Imwe's character repeating the same sentence all over again becomes really annoying after a while. There's an important Jedi temple in the movie and we don't get any information of it. We don't even see it from inside and I guess that would have been quite important for most of the fans... So all togeather I have to say it was a disappointment."

To further prevent one from immersing into fantasy, the oddly rendered CGI characters distracted the mind towards the glitchy, strangeness of their appearance, and movement. Also bears the worst acting I think I've ever witnessed. The actor playing Cassian - could he emote, and commit to a scene more anaemically? The characters were so one dimensional, that I just didn't care about them or their mission. Cue boredom. Given how great were the rest of the special effects, and set production that's saying something. Worst one of the lot. So glad it's over."

      "text": "All Star Wars die hard fans please don't read any further because this review of \"Star Wars: A Star Wars Story\" will make you very mad!! \"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story\" is loud, noisy, boring and, except for 4-5 lines that are funny, not at all original. Anyone with even a rudimentary knowledge of the series will know where it is heading from the introduction of Felicity Jones, as Jyn Erso who is the daughter of scientist Galen played, by Mads Mikkelsen. Without giving away any plot if the daughter had listened to the father about a mistake he made on purpose the picture would have been only an hour instead of the 2 hour 13 minute running time.The movie has more wars than all the Star Wars pictures combined plus one of the loudest soundtracks heard in a long time. The CGI effects are out of this world, no pun intended, and in some cases amazing as an actor who has been dead over 22 years is very much alive, another looks 40 years younger and another who is in their 80s sounds like a teenager! They are the set up for the very first Star Wars movie ever made though the ending leaves nothing in doubt.I wasn't familiar with many of the leading actors but I was impressed with Donnie Yen as a blind monk, Wen Jiang as a warrior, Riz Ahmed a pilot and Diego Luna as one of the leading rebels. Oh yes, a nod of the head to Alan Tudyk for the wisecracking 7-8 foot droid K-2SO. Forest Whitaker is wasted in a cameo which really has nothing to do with what the screenplay by Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroy is heading for and director Gareth Edwards is all over the screen in the action scenes and only hits the warmer minutes towards the end of the film.Oh I forgot to mention Ben Mendelsohn's villain maybe because he is forgettable?I am not a fan of Star Wars or sci-fi films and told Allen he is on his own for future Star Wars films.Unless you are a fanatical fan of the series or a couple of CGI effects regarding people I would suggest staying away."
