The costumes, indoor and outdoor scenes are glorious and I was captivated by the story from start to finish. It has great songs, some of which are famous and I didn't know were attributed to this musical and the two leads, particularly Audrey Hepburn, sing and act really well. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and will definitely be watching it again."
