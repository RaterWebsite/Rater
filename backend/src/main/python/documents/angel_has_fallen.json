Everyone in the cast was fun to watch (including Gerard Butler, Morgan Freeman, Danny Huston, and Nick Nolte), but don\u2019t expect anything more than a lot of roller-coaster action and the comforting feeling that movie politics has its villains but they don\u2019t win in the end."

It seemed after the mixed reviews for Phantom something went wrong though he has made a good living overall making a total of 42 movies of which the last dozen have mainly been in the action genre which \"Angel Has Fallen\" definitely fits. All in all it probably has one of the highest body counts, countless violent scenes and surprise, surprise a few, very few, quiet scenes first with his wife and baby and then with his father, the latter played by Nick Nolte, who I have been a fan of since 1974 on television in \"Rich Man, Poor Man\"."

      "text": "The Fallen franchise deviates from the previous installments by taking a page from The Fugitive and having Secret Service member Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) framed for treason and having to go on the run to find who set him up. This is a generally entertaining film, but I found that there was a strangely interesting balance of several good and bad aspects.This was a lot more tonally balanced than the previous two films. Olympus has Fallen was weirdly cynical for a save-the-hostages film. London has Fallen unsuccessfully tried to involve both moral greyness and jingoism not to mention that there were a couple moments where Banning seemed to take a little TOO much pleasure in punishing the enemy. Here, I could mostly just sit back and enjoy myself without questioning anything.However, the basic story is CONSPIRACY ACTION MOVIE 101; nothing particularly new. I did like the script's attempts, albeit merely for entertainment reasons, of looking at the war machine and interference vs. non-interference.Butler's still got it as Banning. Nick Nolte is a fun new addition as Banning's reclusive survivalist, anti-government father. The villains if not outstanding are smart and provide a reasonable threat with some neat tricks up their sleeves.The action is quite good, especially the opening attack and the final confrontation. Thought the lighting is pretty grey, especially considering the first film, but it suits the tone here. Director Ric Roman Waugh (who helmed The Snitch with The Rock) has a good eye for visuals and settings.The camera work is distracting. There is way too much shaky cam not to mention a couple misplace quick pans. This even happens when people are just having everyday conversations. Also, there's a car chase with way too many interior shots of inside the cars than the action you actually want to see.I definitely think this is better than London has Fallen. Though not the greatest action movie ever made, this is a good time-waster."

You could say that Morgan Freeman and Gerard Butler deliver fine performances, but... for Christ's sake, does that even matter? When a movie so unoriginal as this one wastes 2 hours of your precious life, do you even care whether the actors were good?This is the sort of nonsense that should not have been greenlighted.Garbage.3/10."

But while Angel provides a few possibly memorable set pieces \u2014 a chase involving police vehicles and a stolen semi, an assault on Clay's cabin led the ancient coot to launch an inferno of booby traps, and lastly a multi-story all-white company lobby directly from a Michael Mann film. They all fall victim to excessive repetitive editing and inadequate kinetic energy, a problem that no quantity of firepower on-screen, twisted wreckage, or off-beat camera angles can solve. However, a sequel that is just a pedestrian is a drastic improvement considering the awfulness of its predecessor, which was the pick of this publication for the worst movie in 2016."

Secret Service Agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) is framed for an attempted assassination of President Trumbull (yes you read that right) played by Morgan Freeman. Banning must now try to prove his innocence while trying to uncover the real threat. Gerard is back doing what he does best, growling and punching his way through yet another generic action movie that starts to feel like a video game on more than one occasion.Butler and Freeman are clearly just here for the paycheck, in fact Morgan Freeman downright admitted that so I can\u2019t be mad really. Though action movies in recent years have raised the bar, (looking at you Mission Impossible Fallout) if they keep churning out these mindless action movies will anyone bother anymore? Honestly the only reason anyone is bothering with Angel Has Fallen in the first place is it\u2019s the third film (yeah I know how did that happen?) in a franchise starring everyone\u2019s favourite knuckle head Gerard Butler. What it lacks, it almost makes up for in entertainment even if it is twenty minutes too long. The action sequences are well done and frequent enough to keep you interested and the addition of Nick Nolte was strangely hilarious. Perhaps Angel Has Fallen wasn\u2019t supposed to be this funny but it\u2019s enough to move it into the \u201cso bad it\u2019s good\u201d category. Now I\u2019m sure some of you are wondering whether you can see Angel Has Fallen without seeing the previous two movies in the franchise and the answer to that is yes you can. Recommended for the Gerard Butler fans or anyone needing your weekly cinema fix."

      "text": "When we think of iconic action heroes, the names that come to mind are John McLain, Rambo, or Jack Bauer, but what about Mike Banning? For a third time, Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) has proven himself to be the only thing standing between the U.S. President and assassination, only this time, he's also a target. In the third installment of the fallen series, Mike Banning saves the president from a drone attack, only to wake up in the hospital to find himself under arrest, accused of planning the whole thing. Now Banning must escape and find out who set him up, before they get to him and finish the job they tried to pin on him. Unlike most trilogies, every single one of these films is terrific, and despite different writers and directors, it has never lost it's edge. In choosing a favorite however, I picked this one, because it was so much different than the rest. Not only is Banning on the other side and in the position of trying to save himself as well as the President, but they bring his family into the story. We finally meet his estranged father, played masterfully by Nick Nolte. A paranoid former veteran living in the woods, the elder Banning is an absolute riot and brings much needed levity to a series that already given us so much. People will look at this and say it's just another action movie, just another attempt by Hollywood to continue to cash in on a successful movie, and normally I'd agree, but not this time. Angel Has Fallen not only features the new face of action films, but it also offers edge of your seat action, a compelling and dramatic story, as well as a little bit of humor, all things that you're normally hard pressed to find in just another action film. That's why we're labeling this one a must see movie!"

      "text": "Nick Nolte plays a grumpy old guy who blows up a score of bad dudes in a confrontation on a mountaintop that is a somewhat reminiscent of the first Rambo movie. That is the only fun part of the movie and, alas, very short. It is why I gave it a three, instead of a two.There is also another guy in this movie, played by Butler. He is an ailing secret service guy past his prime. Despite that he kicks the butts of men half his age, and outwits everyone. Not because he is smart, but because he has plot armor and plot brains and everyone else is shockingly dumb or incompetent. This is how you write a story when you are unable to make a smart guy do smart things. He basically just runs to some place and survives everything with nary a scratch. At one moment he actually runs into a room where a bad guy has the drop on him. But the bad guy waits for Butler to shoot him.There are so few surprises that it actually surprised me. It takes half a braincell to figure out who the evil guy is behind it all, how the story would develop and how it would end. It was so unsurprising that I actually braced for a twist of some kind, but once the bad guy's voice was being warped when talking to the second main bad guy, I knew it was as bad as I thought it would be. This was just done for the audience.The biggest surprise for me is that three people wrote the script. It is amazing that you need three writers to write a by the numbers story with characters that have no depth or arch and a story that is as shallow as politician's promise.A terrible movie."
