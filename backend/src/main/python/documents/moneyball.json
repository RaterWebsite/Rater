The writers and director made and extremely affecting film out of what could have been a dry subject.  I'm left wondering why the heck Paul DiPodesta didn't want his name associated with the film.  Jonah Hill came off as extremely likable.  And Beane has to be happy with the Pitt treatment.  Great choice in casting Activision CEO Bobby Kotick as the A's owner. I think he nailed the guy."

      "text": "While the book was made more dramatic for film and concentrated more on the relationship building of Billy Beane and a fictional account of his assistant, Paul DePodesta and others into a new composite character, Peter Brand, Moneyball hits every element of a good baseball movie where it should. Right in the heart. A key line in the film is, \"It's hard not to be romantic about baseball.\" Being a die-hard baseball fan, it's hard not only to not get romantic about baseball, but it's also hard not to be romantic about stories like this. While based on a true story, written by Michael Lewis to explain the sabermatic approach that Billy began taking with his previous GM (when he was an assistant), and continued on with Paul, the movie never mentioned the previous GM and began the story of using the sabermatic method after meeting the fictional Peter Brand, played by Jonah Hill. The acting is the best I've seen Brad Pitt do. He was a great fit for this role and I can see why he produced it. He must have thought the same thing. I've heard Oscar buzz about it, but I don't see it carrying that far. He certainly deserves it more than for the Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Jonah Hill plays seemingly the same character he does in every movie, and does it well. And Philip Seymour Hoffman is perfect as a generic portrayal of uncooperative manager, Art Howe, a portrayal in the film and book that the real Art Howe has heavily criticized and blames Beane's disregard for him. Aaron Sorkin brings his skills as a co-writer of the screenplay to dramatize the story very well and make it palatable for non-sports fans, but for those die-hards like me, Moneyball hits all the right places."

Its not and the dialogue is crisp and full of life and truth.

Moneyball teach you that experience does not mean too much when taking a decision. Sometimes you need to take another point of view or a different way, in order to makes things right. This film shows how two men face their ideals and their fear of change, so as to pull out the baseball team of the loser chart. They resort to math and statistics.This team represents the whole life of manager, the players are his family and when he notice that, he decides to forget about the politic of not get involved, because is easier to let them go; and start doing the opposite. Is predictable what comes of that, the team improved.The performance of Brad Pitt is one the best I have seen in years and Johan Hill surprised me, the only problem of the movie is that it is a little bit slow, but when the plot is as original as this one, the speed of the film is not important."

Brad Pitt delivers his usual sensational performance, and completely deserves his Oscar nomination for this role. Jonah Hill lived up to my expectation, which pleasantly surprised me as I honestly thought he would just suddenly become the kid from Superbad, (don\u2019t get me wrong I loved Superbad but just it obviously wouldn\u2019t suit this film) Hill really pulled out all the stops for this role and I would of given him the Oscar.\r The simple story of Billy Beane and the trust he puts into Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) and their story of seeking out this baseball \u2018outcasts\u2019, and putting together an extraordinary team, is surprising rich and easy to grasp. Supported with a strong screenplay really adds to the intensity of the film.\r I really enjoyed the use of archive footage in the film which when put together with the shots of the actors worked really well, and gave the story that extra ump-ff to remind you that this is a true story and this actually happened. Also the attention to detail in this film was superb, the costumes were made to preciously resemble all of the uniforms of the baseball teams which the Oakland A\u2019s took on during the  2002 baseball season.\r I thoroughly enjoyed the experience I felt by watching this film.\r In hindsight I will admit this is not a film which will grab you unless your in the mood for it, it\u2019s not a film that will grab you by the throat and scream at you to enjoy it, it\u2019s not Die Hard. It\u2019s a beautifully crafted masterpiece which creates an emotional connection with you (if you\u2019re in the right mood) and really sticks with you your feelings towards the characters after the film has finished.  This is definitely a film I would watch again and would recommend to anybody."

Forced to reinvent his team on a tight budget, Beane will have to outsmart the richer clubs.

It was okay but curiously, for effect no doubt, devoid of any passion or emotion except when Brad threw things around the clubhouse or at home. Everyone spoke very mannerly and low key, very consciously, except for the coach Billy Beane fired who showed a little genuine passion. Perhaps the fact that all was connected to objective, detached statistics on baseball players they decided to play the movie that way, devoid of passion. Personally, I had more passion in teaching one class than was evident in that whole movie. However, having said that, it was an okay rendering of the information on using stats like on-base percentage to determine a players inherent worth to a team. Still, it is very over-rated!"

      "text": "It's the pitching, stupid. If your team has an ace on the staff, then half the battle is already won. Some pop in the bat doesn't hurt either. The Bears, a motley group of little-league castoffs whom no other team in their division would ever pick, only start to win after their beer-guzzling manager Morris Buttermaker recruits Amanda Wurlitzer, a gender-breaking pitcher with a dominant curve(she's pre-Chelsea Baker, the knuckleball phenom) that the ex-professional ballplayer had decided two years ago was all washed-up as a daughter. On-base percentage doesn't win you games, it's the sound of the ball hitting the catcher's mitt, and the umpire calling the batter out on strikes, swinging or otherwise. In contrast to their former starter Rudi Stein, Amanda is Peppermint Patty to his Charlie Brown; she's unhittable; she keeps her clothes on, but the Bears still lose 1-0, because Lupus, f*****' Lupus, that \"booger-eating moron,\" can't hit the cut-off man from left-field, and lets the game-winning run score. It's not all his fault, though. The Bears can't hit. Never mind the homerun, three games into the season, and the team is still searching for their first baserunner. Coach Buttermaker sees his team's offensive deficiencies, and practically invents Moneyball. So embarrassed was Ahmad by his opening game errors to the Yankees that he hid out in a tree(after a half-inning forfeit), still can't get on base, but the coach knows that the black kid is fast, so the drunkard promises to teach him how to bunt. Ahmad's hero should be Malcolm X, not Hank Aaron, because sabermetrics preaches the theory of \"by any means necessary\". In \"Moneyball\", you half-expect to hear a reprise of Bizet's \"Carmen\", when Oakland A's free-agent pickup Scott Hatteberg, previously the catcher for the Boston Red Sox(damaged goods due to a bum shoulder), makes error upon error, as if the converted first baseman was in communion with Toby Whitewood. To manager Art Howe, he's bad news. But GM Billy Beane, acting on advice from his assistant Peter Brand, a sabermetrics guru, thinks Hatteberg can still play the game. Despite not having Ahmad's wheels, Beane's pet project has the ability to get on base. Hatteberg walks. It's a talent which makes him proportionately more valuable than Mariners' leadoff hitter Ichiro Suzuki, because despite his annual 200 hits, the ten-time all-star swings at a lot of first pitches, resulting in a relatively low on-base percentage, the stat that trumps batting average as the real barometer of worth to the new school, founded by Brand's hero Bill James. Hatteberg, therefore, is worth the trouble, so like Buttermaker teaching Tanner the fundamentals of shortstop, it's Ron Washington's job to make people forget about Giambi by turning the ruined catcher into a functional first baseman. (Washington had his own demon: cocaine.) History shows that Beane's gambit paid off(Hatteberg batted .280, and had a fielding percentage of .994), but it's somewhat misleading and downright downright dishonest, narrative-wise, that \"Moneyball\" should cast this role player as the lynchpin to this financially-strapped team's miracle on the field(the A's sported a payroll three times less than the Yankees: $41M to $126M). Contrary to the sabermetrics propaganda of the film, the 2002 Oakland A's did not win a MLB-high 103 games because Beane traded Carlos Pena to Detroit, which, in effect, forced Howe's hand into playing Hatteberg. It was the pitching, stupid. Oakland had three Amandas: Tim Hudson, Barry Zito, and Mark Mulder. Heck, even the last man in the rotation, Cory Lidle, was more relevant than the pitchers \"Moneyball\" makes mention of: Chad Bradford, a submarine middle reliever, and late-season addition Ricardo Rincon, whose acquisition from the Indians inspires such elation in Brand, you would think that Hudson just threw another shutout. Unlike \"The Bad News Bears\", where the Bears face the Yankees, the A's never did get the chance to square off with the fat cats, losing somewhat ignominiously in the ALDS to the Twins(payroll $40M), who are, perhaps, every bit the underdog that Beane's team was, in five games. The real climax to \"Moneyball\", judging by the postscript, occurs in \"Fever Pitch\", when Jimmy Fallon and Drew Barrymore run onto the field in Yankee Stadium after the Sox clinch the pennant(en route to their World Series win over the Cards), since the film gives Beane's methods all the credit. Does Moneyball work? Well, in the 1976 Michael Ritchie film, while the walks and hit batters keep the Bears alive in that final game with the Yanks, it's Kelly Leak's moonshot that nearly wins it all for the overachievers. Some pop in the bat doesn't hurt. Exhibit A: Miguel Tejada, with his 34 HRs and 131 RBIs. Lucky for the A's, he just swung away, walking only 38 times in 162 games. Then again, Leak doesn't accept the free pass and ends up getting thrown out at home plate."

But he went onto have a very nice career as a GM for the Oakland A's having to play with the big boys {big market clubs} working with about 20% of their capital.  He had a chance to become GM of the Red Sox and turned it down to stay with the A's.  All it proves is that he likes to beat his head against the wall because longterm he can never win.  I would have liked to see more character development because he is in a no win situation.  No questioning his passion for the job but the truth is baseball without a hardcap is a flawed product in which 99% of the times only the big markets can win!  Nice acting but otherwise the movie is going nowhere.  It is never explained why he is such a troubled soul?  I would have loved to see his life unfold.  What is the definition of insanity?  To do the same thing over and over and to expect a different result.  Billy can find talent but has no chance of ever keeping it the way the current state of affairs is managed under Bud Selig.  I live in NYC but feel the small markets have been shut out of competing.  How can you continually root for IBM but that is what Yankee fans do every year as they must buy every new toy on the free agent market.  Very sad commentary on true sportsman who love the game on a level playing field.  If Billy had the same tools to work with he is one of the best in the business.  No one doubts that!

Against everybody's suggestion he persists on this path and you can guess the results (or you may know, since this is based on fact). This is pretty much Pitt's movie: He produced it and is in almost every scene. He's engaging enough, but it's Jonah Hill's subdued comic partnership that adds some warmth. Otherwise, it's a non-stop, one-note drive for a man to achieve his vision. While there are a few sports scenes, most of this features people sitting around talking.

The story is simple, manager Billy Beane of the Oakland Athletics decides to put together a team of supposed misfits using statistical analysis instead of the usual methods because their small market team can't afford the expensive players.  There is a side story showing him with his daughter that adds absolutely nothing to the movie at all - I guess it was put in there to try and get women to see the movie.  It is well written and acted throughout, although there are slow moments.  I have to say, however, I was really happy at the ending.  For most sports movies there is a team or person who is considered the underdog and they come back and win it at the end.  That did not happen here (not a spoiler since the story is based on a real happening and the Oakland Athletics did not win that year).

What emerges, is a film about life, laden with its struggles, challenges, losses, and triumphants, with baseball, inconsequentially as its backdrop. For the ardent sports enthusiast, much of the \"art\" of the game is captured, however, it is presented in a manner that is near the fringes of condescension and whose suspension of disbelief and disregard can become offensive to witness. Moreover, the story (albeit \"true\") is deliberately told in fallacy in order to dramatize the truth (can't forget it's Hollywood). This is specifically true in the ball club's roster, of which wasn't as aggregated with misfits as the film suggests. Nevertheless, \"Moneyball\" is a tale that is told with passion, diligence, and finesse, (Zaillian and Sorkin) thanks largely in part to Pitt's amiable character and delivery. While the errors in the film will be hardly noticeable to most, it is certain that the film will leave many thoroughly entertained and ready to dust off the old mitt and get the shoulders warm for throwing.

The film is dishonest because it willfully overstates the impact of a few baseball scrubs and completely ignores the great players the A's already had.  Not only that it willfully misrepresents the fact that Jeremy Giambi (Jason Giambi's brother) played in 124 games for the A's the year before in 2001!  He wasn't a new discovery.  How could the filmmaker not even mention that the A's had one of the best pitching staffs in baseball in 2001 and they were back for 2002:  Barry Zito won 23 games in 2001 and won the Cy Young Award as the league's best pitcher, Mark Mulder won 19 games, Tim Hudson won 15 games.  They are literally never mentioned in the film!  Miguel Tejada is barely mentioned and he was the League MVP batting over .300 with 34 home runs and 131 runs batted in.  Eric Chavez is never mentioned and he hit 34 homers and drove in 109 runs.  David Justice, meanwhile, was kind of a wash out and Scott Hatteberg was important to the team--but, certainly there was already a key group of players in place.  Also, the concept of on base percentage was not new...and the previous A's general manager Sandy Alderson was instrumental in using statistical analysis before Billy Beane arrived.  And, Johnny Damon had had a terrible 2001 season, so letting him go was not without reason anyway.   Also, the Minnesota Twins, who beat the A's in the playoffs, had virtually an identical small payroll and continued to be a more competitive team than the A's over the next decade.  So, my main problem with the film is not to say that the \"moneyball\" approach didn't do anything for the A's--it did.  But, it didn't do everything and they were not alone in using statistical analysis to discover value.  But, that's Hollywood--overstating and making things black and white is their specialty.   Brad Pitt is really getting to be a much better actor as he ages though--he's excellent in the movie."

It was so slow and that I actually slept during the movie for about 5 - 10 minutes. This happened to me for the first time ever. I am sure that this movie will win the oscar. After all oscars are meant for such boring movies. eg - Kings speech over the social network or Inception, Hurt locker over Avatar, Slumdog millionaire, etc..."

The editing is PERFECT and ofcourse a screenplay with Steve Zaillan and Aaron Sorkin as the writers will be great. I hope Bennett Miller does not wait 6 years for his next film! This is how mainstream Hollywood produced films should ALWAYS be, it is said we live in a time where this is considered a masterpiece.(But it really is great though)"

This is valid for sports, your job, you car insurance, your mortgage, etc...A movie those rating agency, presidential candidates, stock traders who only act on rumours should obviously watch. A must see movie for the credit crunch generation."

      "text": "Really enjoyed this movie. It was a sports movie, but not your typical formula. I thought it had a ton of references that only a hardcore baseball fan would understand, but saw the movie with someone who knows nothing about baseball and they still enjoyed it and got it. Really think Brad Pitt was perfect for this role. He's usually solid in everything, but this might be one of his best performances. Truly believed him as Billy Beane."

      "text": "David doesn't slay Goliath in Moneyball, a smart and entertaining film about the business of baseball, but he finds a way to compete in a game that has an incredibly uneven playing field.  Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill turn in excellent performances in a film that serves as a stern reminder that there will always be small teams scraping to compete but that the big teams will always have the upper hand.  The fact that this seemingly dull concept results in a deeply engaging and surprising moving film is one of the minor miracles of 2011."

      "text": "What a well-done, well-cast picture.  Not about baseball per se but about the underside that we don't get to see.  Brad Pitt was perfect in and for the role of Billy.  Philip Seymour Hoffman again shows us why he the consummate actor.  One distraction.  I could not stop looking at a maturing Brad Pitt and seeing a younger Robert Redford.  WOW.  Facial expressions, cragginess at the eyes, mannerisms,  They need to do a picture as father-son."

      "text": "Very good movie about something that is very real about baseball.  Professional baseball is different than any other sport, in the sense that some big market teams truly outspend the small market teams.  The movie does a nice job in making this point.  However, it grossly oversimplifies what Moneyball really is, it is not only looking at OBP (on base percentage), as the movie implies.  It is also a movie; it is not historically accurate in a number of ways.  But neither of those flaws detract from the movie being enjoyable.  Brad Pitt is fine playing a good looking ex-jock and Jonah Hill does a nice job playing a made up character (as the person who really was Beane's assistant refused to let his name be used, which led to Paul DePodesta's \"role\" being played as an overweight nerd).  Phillip Seymour-Hoffman is perfect as manager Art Howe, who the movie vilifies (as it also does to scouts).  Perhaps that dichotomy is the biggest weakness of an entertaining film:  creating tension by making the good guys really good and their enemies seemingly (and at the same time) stupid, vicious and mean.  But that's movies for you.  Still an enjoyable film that is worth seeing."
