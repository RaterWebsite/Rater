  "description": "Year three at Hogwarts means new fun and challenges as Harry learns the delicate art of approaching a Hippogriff, transforming shape-shifting Boggarts into hilarity and even turning back time. But the term also brings danger: soul-sucking Dementors hover over the school, an ally of the accursed He-Who-Cannot-Be-Named lurks within the castle walls, and fearsome wizard Sirius Black escapes Azkaban. And Harry will confront them all.",

It's certainly the most impressive visually, as Hogwarts, which sometimes felt as thrilling as a funeral home during Columbus' films, comes vividly alive in the third film. Sirius Black is such an intoxicating and great character, he really ties the movie together greatly. This was arguably Rowling's peak in the series."

      "text": "In year three, our cast of unique and magical characthers have to deal with a new threat, an escaped prisoner, from Azkaban Prison, who seems to want to kill Harry Potter. Azkaban was a return to the magical formula that made Harry Potter legendary. The story here is suburb and unlike the Chamber of Secrets, it isn't dummied down or rushed for us. New elements are introduced such as the secret map and time travel, but perhaps most important of all we finally see Harry demonstrate some of this incredible power that has led to his fame at Hogwarts. The story was terrific, the action was great, the performances were off the chart, and the childish stuff was kept to a minimum, but was Azkaban perfect? Many critics will tell you that this is the best of the Potter films and it was terrific, but personally I was hoping to see more of the world outside of Hogwarts. I was looking forward to possibly seeing the inside of Azkaban prison and some of the people who are locked up there. While I appreciate the different views and new filming location, it was still centered at Hogwarts. Not a bad thing, but personally I'd have liked to have seen something else. Aside from that, new Director, Alfonso Cuaron, does use parts of the story that were excluded in the previous films, he also does give us a new location, and view of things. Overall, Cuaron really does do a tremendous job, making this film geared more toward young adults than children. Azkaban is much closer to being what J.K. Rowling intended than the Chamber of Secrets was. I absolutely loved this film, there are just some parts of this film that are truly amazing. If you're picky like I am, and are only going to give Harry Potter one shot, then I suggest the film you watch is The Prisoner of Azkaban."

The way the students resolve the final puzzle in the end is also pretty slick.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is another interesting story."

The storyline is also my favorite of the series, and this movie sticks to the source material incredibly well.

It was dark and unrelenting to watch. The only thing that appealed to me was how it ended and the magical scenery around Hogwarts. The rest, I could forget about it. There never was a bright moment in the movie, and the only thing Harry has to hold onto is his two friends, Hermoine and Ron. Harry has enemies, he has friends. He still hasn't fully understood that he will in the end have an epic battle with Voldemort because he has an ultimate desire too. Lord Voldemort is very powerful, but his lurking presence around the halls of Hogwarts doesn't frighten him as much as it used to. The director gives us an uncomfortable viewing experience that I wan't happy with and wish this doesn't happen again in the next film."

The \"dark\"ness? Did they read the book? Did the !@^%$#!&! director even read the book!?!?! Or did someone just give him a 2 minute summary of it and he made the movie out of what he could remember from it? How did JKR agree to this? Did she even? I can only imagine her feelings of horror as she watched her book getting murdered. It seems these questions will go unanswered. Feels like scenes were mixed up and a lot of stuff has been horribly changed and a lot has been left out. Good thing the director didn't stick around for the fourth part. Good riddance."

Watching the films in this way really emphaszies how different the third film is from its predecessors. If I had not seen the first two films I would probabyl have rated this film a bit higher, but what bothered me was that this director chose to change both the scenery and Hogwarth's structure/routines. I liked that the first two films played up Hogwarth's similarities to traditional English boarding schools, and I was especialyl disappointed to see that this new director chose to \"modernize\" so many things (including the street clothing the characters wear for much of this film). Most significant is the castign change for the role of Professor Dumbledore. Another reviewere noted here that Dumbledore is the centre of the novels, and it's important to really feel that he's trustworthy as a leader. The late Richard Harris was wonderful; the new actor plays Dumbledore as a bit of a joke, and this bothered me. Dumbledore is portrayed in this film as a doddering old man, which is absolutely contrary to the books themselves and to the prior 2 films. All in all, this film will probably be most appreciated by people who haven't read the books or seen either of the previous films."

The director gives a lot of time to stupid details [the bus, the spider-book, the boggart class...] instead of telling important passages in the story. And, the worst of all: the ending. The ending SUCKS. Looks like they ran out of money. Fortunately this was the only movie directed by Cuaron."

This was the only Potter movie that I've missed in theaters. That was pretty sad. Now to my opinion. Like the first two movies, there's nothing negative to say about this one. The actors were very entertaining (again) and I can say nothing more about Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, or anyone else. The only actor that I have to say to is Michael Gambon for his wonderful performance as Professor Dumbledore. The CGI was cool (again) and even the action was cool (again). The storytelling was amazing and the storyline was well-paced. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a magnificent third entry of the Potter franchise with a lot of depth to the third book of the series. 8/10"

In my opinion this one of my least favorite of the Harry Potter movies.\r Granted the effects are top notch, as usual, acting is mostly OK but perhaps a bit over the top at times. The plot, while interesting, feels rushed and the movie on th e whole feels like th e cliff notes to a much bigger story (one could argue that all the movies are like this, but this one just feels like it more.)\r The darker atmosphere, while done well, really is brought on too quickly when compared to the lighter hearted predecessors. It felt too much like the new director was trying too hard to give it a look and feel of his own.\r Overall:\rHPatPoA is good movie, it just feels like it is missing something that left me thinking \"Is that it?\""

The performances from Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe, David Thewlis, Gary Oldman, Rupert Grint, Emma Thompson, Tom Felton, Alan Rickman, and Maggie Smith stupendous. The visual effects were spectacular especially the Dementor's, the Whomping Willow, Buckbeak the hippogriff, the Knight Bus, and The Monster Book of Monsters. The writing, story and screenplay were amazing. The movies film score was great just like the others have been. The scenery and set continue to be very nice and cool.

Rowling, and is the first in the franchise that isn't directed by Chris Columbus, who makes way for Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n. The cast, however, remains the same, which allows to this film doesn't seems a totally different thing from the first two, although there are changes in the way the story is told and seen. One of the most obvious changes is the gradual abandonment of the use of black school robes, almost ubiquitous in the first two movies. For some fans, its a transition to another stage of the film franchise. Also notable is the arrival of Michael Gambon to the role of Albus Dumbledore, left vacant by the death of Richard Harris. Although loyalty and attachment to the original book and it's details is a feature that will come to gradually disappearing, this movie still follows closely the history of the book. For all these reasons, this movie entertains, delights but haven't nothing surprising."

Overall a great movie recommended for any Harry Potter fan."

If you haven't read the book then you'll either find it very confusing or you'll love it, but if you've read the book then nothing will stop you from finding faults and flaws. The story... well If they just wouldn't have deleted some main plots, it would have been as good as its predecessors. Not including the plots from the book is understandable but introducing new things is unacceptable. Acting... the trio have matured very much and I'd still say they were born for these roles. All the adults are great as usual. The two new actors, David as Lupin was perfect but Michael Gambon as Dumbledore... oh boy! Erase what I said in the beginning about the alterations in the plot being its weakest point. No! Michael Gambon is the weakest point of the movie. He sucks big time!!! He has tarnished the Dumbledore portrayed by the versatile actor Richard Harris and the character created by the prolific writer J.K.Rowling. Michael Gambon - one of the major reasons why I disliked the movie, the other reason was the tiny whomping willow. Direction... I don't know why Warner bros removed Chris. It's not that Alfonso is not talented, but changing a director breaks a smooth flow which was found between movie 1 and 2. Sorceror's and chambers felt like it was from the same world but this movie feels like a whole new world, only the characters are same. Chris had improved upon chamber of secrets by making it dark and suspenseful and with prisoner he would have made a hell of a movie (mean it in a positive manner). Visuals... for a 2004 movie it's visuals are excellent. Even today they look fantastic! Overall I'd rate this movie a B+. I would have given it an A if the director hadn't changed the small details which makes it very different from the books and the predecessor movies."
