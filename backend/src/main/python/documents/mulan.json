      "text": "Mulan came out towards the end of Disney\u2019s peak era of animated musicals, which began in 1989 with The Little Mermaid and ended in 1999 with Tarzan. The company released 9 major feature films of that genre in that period, and I rank Mulan is somewhere about 5th or 6th in that pack: a quite entertaining, beautiful film, with very good musical numbers, which only lacks in a few story elements and a central heroine not quite as well-rounded as the likes of Ariel, Belle or Jasmine from past films. On balance the good stuff in this film far outweighs the minor issues I had. Mulan, even if it isn\u2019t one of the better Disney musicals, is certainly one that should satisfy those of all ages looking for a rousing and inspirational tale. The strangest thing though is the first song in the closing credits: I'm not sure what they were thinking with that; doesn\u2019t fit at all with the film."

      "text": "After watching the remake I appreciate this even more. It is a Disney classic and excellent movie. It is the Disney version of the ballad of Mulan. A Chinese legend where Mulan takes her fathers place in the army because he is too old to serve and her brother is too young. This was at a time were women were discriminated and thought to be inferior so she had to pose as man or other sources claim her comrades did not recognize it until the war ended. Disney took a lot of liberties and succeed. The story is excellent as Mulan faces the drill and brutality of war as an invading army threatens China. Mulans journey is one of self discovery as she must hide her gender and overcome the odds. She does this by hard work, willpower and determination. She earns the trust and respect of her comrades and superiors while being torn out by the fact that she is hiding and lying to them. The other characters are ranging from fitting to excellent. Be it Li Shang as her commander, her family, the emperor and the excellent intimidating villain Shan Yu (maybe a bit too cliche). Then there is Mushu the small dragon like family guardian. He is the comic relive and hidden star. He improves the movie and is voiced by comedians in nearly all versions (US: Eddie Murphy German: Otto Waalkes and French: Jose Garia). The story is well done and focus on character development and interactions. The animation look still good today and the soundtrack is really good but it is the kind that can be a hit or miss. Overall a classic Disney movie that is still excellent. I prefer it over the remake any day. I give 1 additional point because the remake made me appreciate the original even more. Extra knowledge: While women were suppressed in China it did not stop them. There are female empresses like Wu Zetian and Cixi (not official named empress but empress in everything but name), bad ass warriors like Lin Siniang, scientists like Wang Zhenyi or the pirate queens  Zheng Yisao (Yes she was represented in Pirates of the Caribbean) and Ching Shih."

The era that brought us fantastic films from 'Beauty and the Beast' (1991) to 'The Lion King' (1994), 'Mulan' does stand out as one of the best. It follows the story of a young girl named Mulan, who is destined to get married, but something doesn't sit right with her. She feels that arranged marriage isn't in her future, and when she hears that there is an invasion that will take place in China, and that her father must go out to war, she begins to worry. Her father is older and weaker than most of the soldiers enlisting to fight and she fears that she may lose him. Mulan decides to take matters into her own hands and goes undercover as a man to fight in the war. She is not alone, however, Eddie Murphy voices a tiny dragon named Mushu, who decides to guide Mulan so that no harm should come to her. Upon entering the camp where every man is trained, Mulan finds it difficult at first, but quickly gains her way to becoming experienced. 'Mulan' is a solid Disney film with bold animation, catchy songs, a fantastic lead character and a good message for young audiences to learn in the end. It really is one of the best Disney films that the studio has had to offer."

I consider this to be one of the first GOOD movies to come out of that greedy capitalist hellhole called Disney in years. Some of the arguments against it have been ridiculous.\"It's racist!\" Oh come on people, it's supposed to be and adventure/war movie, not a remake of Ghandi! The Huns are bad, the Chinese are good because that's how it was in the ancient legend. A movie like this is not supposed to put political correctness before entertainment.\"It's discriminating against men!\" Lighten up, please. I'm a guy and I wasn't offended by this. It's from Mulan's perspective, and I think it's safe to say she was somewhat prejudiced. Besides, Shang was cool. There was nothing wrong with him.\"It's too violent!\" I hate to break it to you, but war happens. Yes, there are fields of bodies. Yes, the bad guys kill people. Yes, it might scare little kids. But seriously, the evening news is way more violent. These things happen, and if your kids never know about it then they're going to be pretty freaked out when they first encounter the real world.In short, Mulan is a great movie for anybody who doesn't want they're kids to live in a bubble. It's got action, romance, friendship, the whole works, and would have been great even if it wasn't animated."

The Chinese emperor orders a general mobilization, with conscription notices requiring one man from each family to join the Chinese army. When Fa Mulan hears that her elderly father Fa Zhou, the only man in their family and an army veteran, is going to war once more, she becomes anxious and apprehensive due to his weakening health. Taking her father's old armor and cutting her long hair, she disguises herself as a man so that she can enlist instead of her parent. The family quickly learns of her departure, and Mulan's grandmother prays to the family ancestors for Mulan's safety. The ancestors order their \"great stone dragon\" to protect Mulan. They send the small dragon Mushu, a disgraced former guardian, to awaken the stone dragon, but he accidentally destroys it in the process. Mushu conceals this from the ancestors and resolves to protect Mulan himself.Reporting to the training camp, Mulan is able to pass as a man, although her military skills are initially lacking. Mushu provides clumsy guidance to Mulan on how to behave like a man based on his poor judgement and stereotypical views. Under the command of Captain Li Shang, she and her fellow recruits Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po gradually become trained warriors. Desiring to see Mulan succeed, Mushu creates a fake order from Shang's father, General Li, ordering Shang to follow the main imperial army into the mountains. The reinforcements set out, but arrive at a burnt-out encampment and discover that General Li and his troops have been massacred by the Huns.As the reinforcements solemnly leave the mountains, they are ambushed by the Huns, but Mulan cleverly uses a Huolongchushui cannon to cause an avalanche, which buries most of the invaders. An enraged Shan Yu slashes her in the chest, and her deception is revealed when the wound is bandaged. Instead of executing Mulan as the law requires, Shang spares her life, but nonetheless expels her from the army. Mulan is left to follow alone as the recruits depart for the imperial city to report the news of the Huns' destruction. However, it is discovered that several Hun warriors, including Shan Yu, have survived the avalanche, and Mulan catches sight of them as they make their way to the city, intent on capturing the emperor.At the imperial city, Mulan tries convincing Shang about Shan Yu's survival to no avail. The Huns capture the emperor and seize the palace. With Mulan's help, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po pose as concubines, and are able to enter the palace. With the help of Shang, they defeat Shan Yu's men; as Shang prevents Shan Yu from assassinating the Emperor, Mulan lures the Hun leader onto the roof, where she engages him in single combat. Meanwhile, acting on Mulan's instructions and signal, Mushu fires a large skyrocket at Shan Yu. The rocket strikes and propels him into a fireworks launching tower, where he dies in the resulting explosion.Mulan is initially reprimanded by the Emperor for having destroyed the palace and shamed the army and her family, but is unexpectedly praised by himself and the assembled inhabitants of the city for having saved them, who bow to her in an unprecedented honor. While she accepts the crest of the Emperor and the sword of Shan Yu as gifts, she politely declines his offer to be his advisor, and asks to return to her family. Mulan returns home and presents these gifts to her father, who is overjoyed to have Mulan back safely. Having become enamored with Mulan, Shang soon arrives under the pretext of returning her helmet, but accepts the family's invitation to stay for dinner. Mushu is reinstated as a Fa family guardian by the ancestors amid a returning celebration."
