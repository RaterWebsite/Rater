The animated show used to come on TV but for some reason I wasn't really fond of it. I think it had something to do with the fact that its animation is not really kid-friendly and it does not have the same sense of humour as Tom and Jerry or Looney tunes. It was only later that I got to know that this is a movie and the animated show was just an adaptation. My sister watch this movie as a kid, so we decided to to watch attack on watch it on Amazon Prime for the sake of nostalgia. It was quite fun to watch, but not something I would want to rewatch.Stuart Little is a story about the eponymous mouse who comes to live with his adopted family and how he slowly bonds with them over regular family issues. I personally think that Stuart Little is a very good example of teaching children how animals are also sentient beings like us. In spite of being a smaller creature Stuart proves that he is not of smaller value. This is exactly what makes this character so special. He does not give up on his dignity when someone talks down to him, which would happen either if he decides to turn violent or if he accepts what they are saying.Initially George was not very happy when he learnt that his family decided to adopt an animal instead of getting him a new sibling. Not just him, but their domestic house cat Snowbell was also very tensed about what other cats will say when they find out a mouse has become his master. And so he decides to get Stuart out of the house by hook or by crook. But in spite of all this Stuart continues to help them in need, like when he made George's boat for the boat racing competition and helping Snowbell escape from the cats.The cinematography of this movie is very good, but it is not suited for a children's movie. It has a very adult feeling to it, considering it has a hole some humour and not an outrageously humorous one. This is probably the reason why I didn't like the animated show, and now I can see where this problem came from. The visual tone and colour palette are such that this movie can only appeal to the audience of Harry Potter or Narnia, which is a very different target audience from what this movie aims to focus on.Although I liked the movie, I found to be very boring. It's not something I can watch after I grow up without dozing off. This is the reason why I have said that I will not watch it again. It seems a drag to watch this even when I have to show it to someone else. Plus this movie doesn't suit adults very much because of its child-like conflicts and happy ending. I haven't watched any sequels and I don't plan to. I hope there is nothing worthwhile in the sequel which I have to watch to understand something from this movie, not like this looks like that kind of a movie."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Bad Movie. I HATE STUART LITTLE!!!!!!!!! The movie, which stars Stuart Little, is completely unrealistic. Why would any family in their right mind choose a MOUSE over a child?? The only explanation I have is for the tax break, which actually makes the parents pretty heartless. Which made me even more sad because I loved Hugh Laurie in House. Think of the poor kids who got passed over for adoption because of this rat. And he\u2019s supposed to be the hero? Honestly, Stuart is heartless and cold and deserves no remorse. 0/10 would NOT watch again"}, {"rating": "5", "text": "stuart took priorities over the families actual child and he took the family of some poor orphan. they walked into that orphanage for a child not a rat. it is an orphanage not a pet store. may i remind you it was an orphan HUMAN CHILD they were looking for. i dont blame george for hating stuart at the beginning of the movie, i too would want to squeeze his lungs out like toothpaste. the movie itself was good though i just hate the character of stuart. the mother was hot. the cat, snowbell, was the best character she wanted to eat stuart and shoudlve when she had the chance"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "----------------------------------7.3/10-----------------------------------"}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Please let me kick the mouse.
