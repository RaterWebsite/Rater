Nothing more....not trying to replace your God or your Bible....The book sold over 24 million copies...see the movie and decide for yourself but certainly don't miss it if you are broken, have issues and need healing !! For heavens sake....don't listen to the moronic movie critics....most wouldn't know a good movie or good content if it slapped them in the face."

Every man, woman and child on this Earth will suffer at some point , it's inevitable.  The message this movie promotes is belief that no matter what,  God's plan is greater than our comprehension... and God IS good.   No doubt,  due to the Christian nature of this movie,  the critics are extraordinarily critical on it (forgive the pun).  It's a great film experience and lends itself to those that are,  or have been,  broken."

      "text": "The Shack is a refreshing Christian film that presents a lot of really cool ideas and interpretations of theology. The film boils down to two positive lessons: 1) Don't judge others and 2) Forgive others, especially when it is hard. The appearance of The Angel of Wisdom and the portrayal of God as a loving parent as opposed to an all-mighty judge was a really unique way to present The Lord on film, and I loved it. The Shack is very uplifting if a little kitschy at moments, but overall the cast handles the subject matter incredibly well, and there are some beautiful shots. If you're looking for a pick-me-up then The Shack is definitely for you."

      "text": "If forgiving is that easily convincible, then welcome to the crime world!A novel based film. A religious themed film. It has a message, BUT could be a bad message for today's world. Because how the event was dealt with the story only encourages the crime, in reality. Wise people can say philosophically, morally, but not means every words practically applicable. The common people would get affected more. Other than that, I have no grudge on anything. If it has been just a fantasy and an entertaining film, excluding that Christian thing, I would have liked it better.It was more like another 'What Dreams May Come', but less visual spectacular. On the other hand, there was an uneasiness in the development of what happened in the early stage of the story. They did not go for the detail, from the crime perspective, hence that mysterious event holds the key which we don't know exactly what happened to judge anything out of the film. So that part reminds 'The Lovely Bones'.The story of a father whose little girl mysteriously disappeared on a camping trip. Now the struggling father to cope with the incident gets an invitation to meet the creators. His journey to the other side of the world, where he goes through a series of unexpected tests, and at the end, how his character changes are told in those remaining parts.Worthington, Spencer, everybody was good. But the story is what I did not like. Like it was aimed for Christians only. But I believe not every Christian would agree with this story. I felt it was an unnecessary film. If it was fun like 'Bruce Almighty', the whole world would have enjoyed it. Too serious and very not acceptable message led this film to fall. No, it is not worth a watch for people with the open mind, unless this is what you were looking for.3/10"

The acting is actually pretty good and the plot isn't terrible, but just about everything else in the movie is. I think the editing was the ultimate downfall of this film. Just a strange film, that had potential and didn't at the same time. Hard to put my finger on it."

      "text": "The Shack. Father, Son and Holy Spirit. The first experience of watching a drama with a Christian bias, and despite the negative reviews from critics and viewers, I really liked the film. The film is quite good at trying to convey the general essence of the Bible and God's attitude to everything that happens in the world. All the main characters do an excellent job with their roles and show all the pain and suffering from the loss of someone important in their lives. It is also a very beautiful movie in places, and all the landscapes look like they are alive. Of course, The Shack doesn't try to explain the entire Bible, but it does answer some questions. But there was only one question left by the end of the movie, where is Skillet's song \"Stars (The Shack version)\"?"

      "text": "The film that explains the essentials about God, from the point of view of most Christians.All films have their target audience. There are no films designed to please everyone, even the most generalist. This film is, in essence, Christian. Therefore, it will not please atheists or the vast majority of non-Christians, and it does not seem to me to have been designed to convert atheists or other people to a belief or religion. It is a Christian film, yes, but aimed at those who, at least, believe in God and Jesus as His Son. And this is how I think this film should be analyzed, if we are to be fair and rigorous. Of course, I'm a Christian (I'm actually a Roman Catholic) and I go to Mass on Sundays. My view of this film will not be the same as that of a Christian who does not practice his faith collectively, or of a Jew, or of a person who believes in God but has a more Gnostic view, or a more abstract view of Him. Therefore, I will speak only from my perspective.The script is quite good: Mack was responsible for the death of his violent and alcoholic father; then, already married and father of children, he has his youngest daughter kidnapped, apparently raped and killed by a child molester. Nor was the body found. For all this, Mack blames God, accusing Him, and sinks into his own pain. A while later, he receives a mysterious note, signed by \"papa\" (as he called God), asking him to meet him at the house where everything happened.To begin with, the film makes an excellent use of the text and the symbols present in the Bible without, however, sticking too much to the sacred text. One thing I noticed when watching this movie with my girlfriend was that God is truly explained and the film answers a lot of questions and doubts about God and the way He acts. Another thing that is explained is that God is not the cause of evil. People choose evil, and God respects the choices they make. God does not present himself in one form, he can assume the face he wants and he reveals himself in the form of his three distinct people: the Father, Jesus and the Holy Spirit, incarnated in people of both sexes and different ethnicities, symbolizing how universal it is God: God is God of everything and everyone, and loves even those who do not believe in Him. What happens in this film is a whole process in which God acts visibly in a person's life ... it's what we call a miracle.I confess that I enjoyed seeing Sam Worthington in this film more than in others he did, like the \"Titans\" films he starred in. I think that here he had more space to show talent, since most of the film is based on dialogues between his character and other characters. Octavia Spencer and Graham Greene embodied God the Father in a masterful way. Israeli Avraham Aviv Alush and Japanese Sumire were equally good at bringing the two other people in the Trinity to life. As I said above, the choice of men and women of different ethnicities to give body to God was intentional and probably shows that God embraces everyone ... I don't think it was a choice based on the politically correct as I have read elsewhere. Anyway, the film is not a dramatic interpretation show, but it has its moments and a committed cast.I am not a fan of Christian or spiritualist films, but I must recognize that this film has quality. At no time did I feel that I was listening to a Sunday sermon or the film was trying to preach anything. It is not a film made to convert nor was it made for unbelievers, but it is also subject to being loved or hated, rather than understood. But that is the price to pay for taking up such a delicate topic."

      "text": "This film is the most important film ever to have been released. It has the potential to change the attitudes and beliefs of ordinary people worldwide and for generations to come. We are currently living in a world which has very little time for God. Instead we spend our entire time judging other people and imposing on them our own man-made moral standards and definitions of what is right and wrong. Unfortunately the religious establishment has largely colluded in this process. Through its doctrines of dogmatic biblical literalism, loving families are being torn apart as people grieve because they believe their loved ones died unsaved and are forever in hell. This film confronts this cruel philosophy head-on by portraying God as the truly loving and forgiving God that we know through Jesus. It speaks directly to our hearts in a beautifully creative and quite original way and has the potential thereby to change millions of people's lives for ever. And that is something that no film has ever succeeded in doing."

      "text": "I think it probably helps to be open minded if your likely to take much away from this film - its one that requires you to suspend disbelief somewhat. On the plus side, it features some quite pretty scenery, with brightly coloured plants/foliage and some beautiful starry skyscapes.There must have been a fair bit of money spent on CGI surely - you can tell what isn't real but the effects are pretty decent regardless.It is potentially quite thought provoking but I imagine it is hard for some people to take seriously given the plot. Its obviously intended for a Christian/religious audience, which will likely put off other audiences. There is a definite cheesiness present but yet I felt like by the end of the film, I really wanted the best for the main character and I was somewhat emotionally attached to the characters and I liked some of the sentiments. Do I fully believe every sentiment 100%? maybe not but I felt the film is still, at its heart, a good film. I imagine it has got, or will get, a lot of criticism but I liked something about it - I suppose a well (well enough?) meaning film about trying to see the bigger picture, dealing/coping with the aftermath of sad things, accidents, tragedies.This is a film that won't be for everyone by any means but for what it is, its relatively good."

In the book they find Misy's body in real life showing what Mack saw has merit, it was such a let down after a really good movie that made me cry.Anyways the people here saying it forces Christianity down your throat is a wee bit too dramatic, it's about Christianity but the lessons it tries to teach you can be applied to real life whether you're religious or not, forgiving is not forgetting, we shouldn't judge others."
