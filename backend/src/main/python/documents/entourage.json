      "text": "Entourage the movie is a bit of a celebration for the 8 amazing seasons that ran on HBO.  It won't stand as strong on its own given that audiences will have roughly 10-15 minutes to get to know these characters that we fans of the TV show had years to invest into.  Translation: it's better to see the series before you see the show.  There are numerous inside jokes and tons of celebs that are in this movie for a reason.  Like high school reunion, it's crazy and awesome to see all of these people throwing down in one viewing.  What is most unfortunate is that Entourage ran on incredible scripting and strong characters  that worked through intense Hollywood-life problems that spanned numerous episodes.  Throwing what usually took 4-8 episodes to discover and resolve is meant to be shoved into a movie that's well under 2 hours.  Jeremy Piven as Ari Gold remains one of my favorite characters EVER, and even he gets gated at times.  Piven's ability to rage all over the screen is one of the cornerstones of the show and only gets partially displayed in this movie.  There are a few side stories that begin in this movie that never really pan out either, making me wonder why its makers didn't spend a little more time hashing out the details.  Either way, I enjoyed the movie and finally watched it after going through the TV series for a second time.  It moderately taps into the events of the series finale and I enjoyed that about it.  But anyone coming in off the street is going to be at a disadvantage from minute one, so hopefully you can dig the humor and the fun being had on-screen enough to not care too much about how this crew wound up where they are."

It is just stuffed with pointless subplots that have no true resolution, and are blatantly obvious that they were forced into the film to get it to an acceptable movie runtime.\r Still, I would be able to be forgiving if the film was funny, which this movie just somehow isn't very. Most of the 28 minute long episodes had more laughs than this 104 minute film. The familiar faces are a comfort, and seeing Ari offend everyone he comes in contact with was amusing, but that doesn't make Entourage anything but an awkward high school reunion, where you're glad to see the old pals, but quickly realize you have nothing left to say to each other."

This movie is pure fan service to the fans of the TV show. If you didn't like the TV show, you won't like the movie, it's that simple. But I DID like the TV Show, but ended up enjoying a half baked, but still watchable movie. The fan base is huge, and by their standards Entourage is already a hit, but there are flaws that are clearly visible in this hype-a-thon, that make it watchable. Okay, there are a LOT of cameos, Liam Neeson shows up, Ronda Rousey, Mark Wahlberg and many more stars, but the highlight of this movie is Jeremy Piven's Ari. Man, does Piven's totally KILL it, his comedy is sub par, and is filled with classic references to the TV Show. Turtle, Drama and Vince are the usual show of guys, and didn't age or change much. Not that I have noticed. But even in this mediocre film, there is a lot of fun to be had. I will watch it again for Piven and the comedy, but it will erase from my mind after a while. Watch it, if you loved the TV Show. Otherwise, find something else this week."

I'm sure that previous fans will enjoy this movie because its almost like watching four episodes back to back. Jeremy Piven stood out to me as being one of the funniest people in the movie and Haley Joel Osment is pretty good at playing the annoying little brat villain. Really what makes this movie great is all the cameos. It seems like everyone in Hollywood is in this movie and you are bound to find someone you like. After watching the film I'm certainly interested in the show."

Ari was funny, but the film's comedy was purely meh, awkwardly switching between (attempted) emotional moments and comedic moments. The acting was just not that good in the first place.

Identifying the multitude of cameos (from Warren Buffet to Liam Neeson to Richmond's own Russell Wilson) becomes the movie's most fun entertainment. Toss in some lavish locales, scantily-clad babes and the most gorgeous Cadillac ever. There's about a TV episode's worth of jaunty dialogue, which leaves another hour with uninteresting relationships and mediocre subplots.

I was perfectly ready to enjoy it with no great expectations, but I was blown away by how little effort they put into the script. Not only was the storyline dull and ridiculous, but it was like they had written it years earlier and couldn't be bothered to make the relevant changes based on things that happened in the series. They just kind of erased everything from the final season and started from scratch, including repeating the same tired old E and Sloane dilemma nearly word for word yet again. All in all, shocking bad, especially considering the actors were fine (with the major exception of Rhonda Rousey), as they obviously all know their characters inside and out."

I was drawn to the lifestyle voyeurism to begin with, but it essentially boils down to being a male version of afternoon soaps.\rThe movie attempts to give everyone a whole series worth of screen time in a double episode. Which means that nothing happens. There is no dramatic tension. Every story that begins, ends abruptly, tied up with a ribbon, and is swept under the rug. Moments where actual comedy might happen are deflated by a relentless stream of pointless celebrity cameos. If they'd have weaved the guys' plots into the main plotline involving Vinnie and the Sixth Sense kid, something might have happened that would've bordered on interesting.\rBut this is Entourage. You get what you've always been given:\rVinnie makes a seemingly idiotic decision while grinning like a moron. Ari makes it happen for no discernible reason.\rAri grits his teeth, screams at Lloyd and has an aneurism. Ari's wife stays with him for no discernible reason.\rE tries to be honest with women. The guys give him **** for not treating them like steak. Women like E for no discernible reason.\rTurtle runs around like a puppy. He is successful for no discernible reason.\rDrama wallows in self pity and humiliates himself. The guys are oblivious that they are living with an old man whose brittle delusions are the only foundation that keep him from suicide. He is still alive for no discernible reason.\rThere is a lot of product placement, for obvious reasons.\rIn the end, everything comes up Milhouse."

But I want a sequel, because I kind of liked it without familiarity with the original story and its characters. Anyway, it did not give me any trouble in understanding, particular this story. But obviously I know I am missing something in those scenes that directly has something to do with the series.\r What a simple tale about the film industry. It actually centered on a bunch of Hollywood actors and producers. When a lead actor wanted to direct his next film for the new production house, he gets a green signal, but the problem arises after production halts in the half way due to exceeding the original budget. All the struggle they go through, especially the studio head who acts between the filmmakers and their financiers is what narrated in this film.\r I don't know what they thought of this those who saw the series, but to me it was a pretty good comedy. Because I had no pressure to expect or to compare it with the original material like they do. The cast was wonderful. I got quite an unexpected and enjoyable twist. Since it was related to the motion pictures, some big film personalities' cameo brightened the overall film.

It is a wholly unnecessary film that in its opening minutes completely undoes much of what the show closed on in its final episodes. Truth be told it is best seen in its original format, television. This is because the movie felt like nothing more than a glorified episode of the show just with more cameos. And I mean a lot of cameos. After a while you start thinking of the people who do not show up instead of the ones that do and some of the cameos are brutally short and pointless except to say, \u201coh hey look who it is,\u201d before they are whisked off the screen. This is not to say the movie is horrible. Being a fan of the show I found many moments in the film to be just as entertaining and humorous as they were before with Vinnie, E, Drama, Turtle, and Ari going through the motions. For those wondering, the \u2018R\u2019 rating does get you plenty of shameless T&A from the most gorgeous women they could cattle call for the film. You also get a healthy dose of \u2018Ari-isms\u2019 from Jeremy Piven. So if you are a die-hard fan of the show go see it. If you never watched the show you won't have a clue who anyone is or why they are important. In the end I think this world would have been best served leaving the boys alone in 2011 to ride off into the sunset. Instead we get a mildly entertaining film that you will likely enjoy in nine months on HBO from your couch."
