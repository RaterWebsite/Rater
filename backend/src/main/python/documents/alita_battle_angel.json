Since Last Jedi I have decided not to watch any reviews before seeing the movie myself. I watched an early screening yesterday and I were not disappointed. Reading up on some of the reviews after I were very surprised to find that especially the very first reviews from the press screenings were actually rather negative. For me this is one of the best Action Adventure Sci-Fi movies in a very long time. For me it is an easy 10."

I was pleasantly blown away by what is easily Rodriguez's best film since sin city. The production cost is there on the screenn with a level of artistic spectacle unseen since the star wars prequels. Much of Iron city is there to draw the eye to and for me this is the first anime to live action film that doesn't completely butcher the source material. It feels about 70% accurate from the manga original with a bit of reshuffling and artistic license here and there. Above all the story just works and the cast are believable in their roles. If your'e a fan of the sci-fi action genre or even just James Cameron epics then this is for you! Glad to have seen this on the big screen but I cannot wait to see this in UHD 4k HDR when it releases in may for, god willing, an extended cut!!"

Action and heart find a great compromise in Alita. The CGI is fantastic in Alita herself of course but also in the bodies and the environments. Rosa Salazar\u2019s Alita was engaging and had a perfect blend of naivete and aggression. Waltz and Connelly's performances both were unique and nuanced, unforgettable! Just a fantastic movie, that leaves you wanting more."

      "text": "I was a bit skeptical about this movie. I was worried that it can end up as another 'college drama' with sci-fi background, typical product from Hollywood. But it's not! My impression was that this movie was divided between day time scenes made by Cameron and night time scenes made by Rodriguez which together gives a nice mixture of two goods. I was surprised that they put so much in such short time and it does not make me feel like I don't know what's going on. I know Manga which helps a bit but there's a lot of small changes that have impact on the story and I'm pretty sure that even people who don't know source material will follow the story without any problem. Despite that there's a lot of small changes in the story it was done pretty well. Usually changes from original material are weak and sometimes even so radical that movie is an insult to original source. But here I enjoyed all of them because all changes were made with a taste and with a respect to the original manga. So I'm pretty sure that all or most fans of GUNNM will be satisfied as this is one of rare movie interpretations done well and are not an insult to a fan. For those scared about 13 (12A) rating: there's nothing to fear. Like Rodriguez said, you just have to change 'human' to 'cyborg' and you are free to do a lot more in the movie than current rating allows to. Of course it's not a slasher or horror with blood everywhere but it's not what this movie or manga is about in the first place. Visually movie is stunning but it's not a something that I care that much so beside that it satisfied my eyes I leave written review about it to others who may have more to say. I would love to see a sequel or even more movies from Cameron/Rodriguez duo in GUNNM universe. I'm giving 10/10 but I don't belong to people who focus on finding every single trivial issue to complain about. Life is too short to do that. I walked satisfied from the cinema, I was entertained and it's what is the most important for me to give a score to the movie."

Perhaps only the ending left me slightly unsatisfied (for obvious and necessary reasons when you see it).  Sure, there are some implausibility issues that critics are citing (and the film borrows story element from a number of other sci-fi sagas we\u2019ve seen), but the characters of Alita and her love interest Hugo are entirely believable and compelling. And Christophe Waltz is fantastic. Ali and Connelly have smaller parts, but they\u2019re terrific. I was concerned, after seeing the trailer, that the bulk of the \u201cgood vs. evil\u201d action would be confined to the MotorBall arena, but it\u2019s not the case. There are some amazing set pieces in this movie.  The film\u2019s action sequences and its visuals are absolutely fantastic. It doesn\u2019t have a heavy \u201cartificial\u201d CGI feel to it at all. And at least in my theater, the 3D experience was better-than-perfect (I typically loathe 3D) \u2013 the screen didn\u2019t look \u201cgrey\u201d or \u201cdim\u201d like it does with most 3D movies. It was entirely bright and all the colors popped.  I can\u2019t imagine this film not doing extremely well with a younger audience, and I absolutely want more of this story."

      "text": "First, some context: I loved the manga growing up. Much the same as I loved the manga of Ghost in the Shell, Blade of the Immortal and others that have received the movie treatment. I was an avowed comic book fan and loved Spawn, the Marvel Universe, Sin City, et all. Here's the thing though - I thought most of the Marvel Movies are just okay, Ghost in the Shell was outright bad, Sin City was at best mediocre, so forth. Outside of Nolan's Batman trilogy, Logan and a couple of the Marvel movies (Thor, namely) I've never thought a comic book movie truly did justice to the source material. I tell you this so you have context for where this review is coming from, I'm a comic book fan and nerd who has not liked almost any of the movies based on comic books.Obviously you can tell based on my rating that I loved Alita. I thought they really nailed it and it disappoints me to see it dumped in February under the expectation of it being a flop. It further disappoints me to see the critical reception which I think is unjust. Hence why I'm going to the pains of taking the time to actually write a review (something I've only done a handful of times to date). Anyhow, here goes:The Good (in roughly this order)1. World Building: This feels like the most well realized fantasy world since Lord of the Rings or Blade Runner. The attention to detail, from inhabitants, to cars, to buildings all just feels really thorough. It makes the rest of what happens work so much better because you're willing to believe in the world they've created. 2. Set Pieces: Holy moly, there are just some jaw dropping set pieces. My friend and I were chuckling, whooping and in general just having a blast. They are some of the best action set pieces put on screen in a long, long time. 3. Acting / Characters: I expected pretty good acting given the pedigree of much of the cast (3 oscar winners?!). But Rosa Salazar crushes it. She humanizes a character, at times feeling petulant, foolish, brash but, nearly always, believably so. The characters don't get as much development as they deserve since there is just so much plotting, but it feels like there is a character who has a lot more about them that we don't know, which is a credit to the actors playing them. 4. Villains: The \"big bad\" feels appropriately intimidating. I love a good antagonist and he is appropriately mysterious and powerful as to make you feel he is an appropriate counterweight to the heroine and also makes you excited to learn more about him. 5. Effects: I am not a big effects person. In general I feel SFX fights lack weight and thus are forgettable. This is, unequivocally, not the case here. This movie probably as the best effects in general (from environment, to characters, etc) I have ever seen. It feels like another major step forward in that department. The Bad1. Trying to do too much: They pack A LOT of story in here. There are more subplots than I can count. It's certainly never dull, but it also doesn't give the characters room the breathe. Which is a shame, since the characters are acted well and have interesting motivations/backstory (per the manga) which don't get their due as a result of how much they are trying to pack in. I would have gladly taken a trade off of a bit more character development for a bit less forward propulsion of the overarching story. 2. Plot contrivance: There are a few moments of \"wait, how the hell did that person get there?\" that really do require suspension of disbelief. They don't do enough to earn it and it feels forced for the sake of moving the breakneck pace of the story forward. They could have made it feel more natural with another 30-60 seconds of context. My strong suspicion is that was there but in an effort to keep the running time down after early testing they cut some of the set-up which left it feeling absolutely manically fast paced."

Of course, if you are more into cheesy love stories or historically accurate biopics, this one is not for you...The adaptation is really good, with some nice workarounds allowing the story to be coherent and fast paced. Ido (Christopher Waltz) and Vektor (Mahershala Ali) are the perfect cast, the lesser known actors do a very good job along with Jennifer Connelly. The choice of a full CGI Alita is coherent, her expressions are well rendered.For the manga lovers, you'll find the most iconic scenes of the first books, and a faithful Gally/Alita character. Some shortcuts have been taken to allow the narration to go fast enough, with subtle modifications, that the fans will notice, but that won't change the core of the universe of GunnmI would love to see the story continued, so please, please, make it a success :) remember that the best best parts of the lore are yet to come !"

The contrast between the Scrapyard and Tiphares wasn't clear enough. A lot of the dialogue felt cheesy, cringey or bland. The presence of real danger, the charisma of some of the enemies, was for the most part of the movie missing. It wish the movie would have been a bit darker atmosphere wise."

      "text": "Alita Battle Angel is what happens when Hollywood finally get an Anime film right, ive gotta say James Cameron and Robert Rodriguez should work more together because this film is incredible.This film had heart and soul poured into its story and you could tell that 1000 of hours of work have gone into making this film. They've pulled one of the best films this year with incredible visual effects and CGI work that give this film a beautiful setting and background.The visual effect of Alita (voiced by Rosa Salazar) we're incredibly done giving detail in her eyes which made her character on screen look more like an actual human actress. Her character and acting is what made this film, they give her a human soul and a purpose with the writing which is so well done, it gives the audience an emotional journey of a young woman trying to discover who she is.The love interest side of the film is so done right it doesn't feel forced as well which along with its action sequences as well as it supporting cast was nothing short of perfect. The story does a great job of not revealing too much to earlier as slowly building up characters so you understand the story and draws you into every moment, this is matched by the awesome fight scenes and great formidable villains of the film adding to incredible film.This is one of those films that deserves a sequel and to be a successful film as of what they've realized here is one of the best live action anime films, with a damn near perfect if it was for slight pacing issue that doesn't really affect the film but is noticeable.Does it live up to the hype? HELL YES this film live up to the hype this is a must to watch on the big screen hopefully were see a sequel come from it because it so needs it."

Especially how successful her iconic anime-eyes are brought to life. Heart warming father/daughter relationship between Alita & Ido. Very amazed & thankful by how much effort they put into the production to nail it as much as possible with some changes here and there. I wont be too nit picky...i dream for a Alita movie back when i fell in love with the manga, and so now here it is--dream come true! I wont say it's the best movie of 2019 though (i could be wrong), but it's most definitely not trash either. it's a good, fun, virtually explosive film painted by talented individuals! I was on the edge of my sit throughout the movie. Rosa Salazar and Cristoph Waltz's father/daughter relationship was very heartwarming.My only regret was the moment i had to rush to the washroom when she got her new body.As a fan of the original manga, i truly enjoyed it; although it's not perfect.

I was expecting the roller ball bits too be too long and to make  the movie drag but they are kept short and fit the story perfectly. A simple sum up of Alita.... AMAZING VISUAL and 3D, an action story with enough meat to it that you had to think a little (not War and Piece but not Mighty Morphing Power Rangers either), acting was good all around, good villains and characters.

I had high hopes for this film ever since it was announced and knew James Cameron was tied to the production. I was NOT disappointed! For the best experience, I highly suggest seeing it in IMAX 3D as it'll better immerse you into the world and characters.I think they did a great job at setting up the story. Beginning with Alita's mysterious past and then throughout the movie unlocking her character and history. I enjoyed the father daughter relationship between Alita and Christoph Waltz character, Dr. Ido. And the love interest between Alita and Hugo seemed natural, and not forced. Rosa Salazar, the actress behind Alita (along with digital artists at WETA Digital) did an amazing job at bringing the CGI character to life. I never got an \"uncanny valley\" feeling from Alita (despite her manga inspired facial aesthetic). It's probably some of the best special effects in film thus far.Speaking of special effects...from crafting the world, to the cyborg side characters, to the action/battle sequences, everything was spectacular. Again, seeing it in IMAX 3D really let's these things shine.Overall, I highly recommend this movie to any fans of Sci-Fi / Fantasy. Definitely worth seeing on the big screen. I hope it does well at the box office too, as they perfectly set everything up for sequels. Such a rich world, characters, etc...would love to see more of it."
