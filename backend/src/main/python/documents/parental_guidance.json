Fairly topica satire on rearing children. Mildly amusing movie making, more or less by the numbers, but warm hearted anyway. Flabby direction overall, with a sloppy script, only held up in the air by the usual Billy Crystal schtick.  Bette Midler is not really given much to do, which is a pity, because she injects a bit of soul and energy into her role as the grandmother. The kids are pretty good, the slapstick sequences less so. Marisa Tomei doesn't make a very convincing mom, but she does appreciably better than her erstwhile husband, who simply stands around in the background channeling his own inner hubby hunkiness - at the expense of any dialogue. In short, a family movie that does not rely on computer effects or frenetic film editing - but which should probably have been a little wittier and crisper in its comic delivery. Frankly, the imaginary kangaroo created most of the laughs."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "It is hard to find a movie these days that one can watch and not see sex, violence, drugs or inappropriate language.  Having a younger child I rented this movie for our movie night and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The combination of Billy Crystal's comedian nature and real life scenarios had me laughing and comparing it to my own life. The little league game was spot on with the way they play it around the country and I feel is ridiculous. The movie was not high budget or have the action packed scenes that most people are looking for in a movie but what it did have was something more.  It had a kids sense of humor built into it so the young ones would stay interested and a plot that most middle ages parents and grandparents could relate to.  Yes the jokes and one liners were a bit on the childish side but that is how it was designed.  This is not a movie written for mature adult audiences but for kids so keep that in mind if you plan on watching it without children around."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Decent, funny comedy, but nothing really special. Billy Crystal was very funny. The philosophy of old school vs, new school parenting had some good laughs, etc. But, it was just really average over all. Pleasant, but not memorable."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "This movie is full of crap! It is not funny at all it is so stupid. Some parts almost made me giggle out loud but the jokes were crap.

Don't watch it."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "We went with our kids and grandkids (ages 12 & 14) to see this film and all of us liked it. It's not great art, nor does it break much new ground, but it made us all laugh. Parts of it are over the top, but there are parts that feel genuine. I had not expected to like it, but I did in spite of myself. The short scene at the end of the credits is worth waiting for."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "From the opening scene of Billy Crystal doing his baseball radio schtick to the next scene where Bette Midler and friends are pole dancing, completely dressed, with a promise of cheesecake after, to the following scene where their daughter, Marisa Tomei, calls them reluctantly and asks them to come to their"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Funny as hell I thought.  Crystal, Midler and Tomei are spot on. So what if the story is schmaltzy.  It made me laugh a lot.  What's a comedy supposed to do?"}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Sad and stupid little movie. Billy Crystal must have naked photos of the studio execs in compromising positions. otherwise this film never gets made. I wanted to laugh but instead I was filled with a sense of loathing for Hollywood. This movie is worth seeing just to test your pain threshold. As a point of reference I also thought City Slickers was unfunny. Lighting your money on fire would be a better use of funds than investing in this garbage."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Crystal and Midler have both done great films in the past so what happened? Not much in this movie. Your typical crude in poor taste comedy, except this one is not funny either. Crystal's classic one liners over the situation around him are kept to a minimum and the life the kids have is less realistic than a cartoon. This movie plays out like a poor Adams Family sequel where the good actors were replaced by poor low paid imitators. The poopie song was kinda funny though so I bumped it up to a 3."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "These movies are getting duller and this movie was a waste of 100 minutes. Sadly there is no comedy and would be better if they changed the story-line. Adam Sandler would make this movie better but the cast we never knew appears in the limelight. Terrible and no fun, the Trailer can not show the real things, practically ruined Flickman's career."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "epic"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "epic"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This is a very nice family movie.

A nice way to spend some time with the kids in the movies.  Go and enjoy."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "It's hard for me to hate on a family friendly movie with a sweet side like this one, especially when movies are getting super vulgar now days. But Parental Guidance fails to bring laughs and fails to hook you with it's emotional side. This makes the movie super boring. Add in the fact that this is aimed at families with kids of all ages and its failure makes it all the more sad. As much as it pains me to say Parental Guidance is not worth your time. You can safely pass on this one."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "The cast was terrific, especially Billy Crystal, who gave a very good performance, but with a script that is filled with mediocre jokes and predictable outcomes where everything goes wrong, Parental Guidance is mostly a generic family comedy."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "This wasn't as funny as I was hoping for but it was a pretty good film to watch with the family. Billy Crystal is great, as usual, and Bette Midler does a good job in more of a supporting role. Surprisingly, especially after my last movie-watching experience, the child actors in this movie were competent bordering on pretty good. The only character who really annoyed you was Marisa Tomei's. Speaking of annoying, that was really the drawback here. Like most modern day family comedies, this movie gets a decent amount of its laughs through pure annoyance. Not as bad as say, Meet the Parents, but it still have too many annoying parts. Overall, Parental Guidance is a decent family film but I wouldn't suggest it for most people."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Now days, Billy Crystal doesn't appear in films as often as he used to, but for the right project and cast, he's always willing to remind us of why he's a household name. It doesn't matter if it's a raunchy comedy or a family film, his quirky and unique sense of humor always makes whatever he stars in that much more enjoyable and Parental Guidance is no different. On the surface, this is just another family comedy about Grandma and Grandpa getting in over their heads when they agree to babysit for the weekend. Add Crystal and Bette Midler to that and all of a sudden the film is taken to a whole other level. Everyone knows what to expect from both Crystal and Midler, but the real magic is their chemistry and how they play off each other, especially when you throw three unpredictable kids into the mix. Some of the scenes with the grandparents trying to use the modern technology or the kids taking advantage of the grandparents lack of respect for their parents strict instructions are truly laugh out loud funny. Yes, that's exactly what I said, it's a PG rated family movie, but it has more than a couple of laugh out loud moments. Parental Guidance is a film that the parents and grandparents will want to see for it's terrific cross-generational cast, but the kids will enjoy it too, for both it's old school and modern humor. It's the perfect rainy day weekend family feature film."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Parental Guidance is a childish and generally bland comedy about grandparents and parents and their children. Bette Midler is good--so is Marisa Tomei... but little else is."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Not only completely unfunny, Parental Guidance is repetitive, uninteresting and annoying. This new Billy Crystal family \"comedy\" is wrong in every sense. It\u00b4s frenetic, yet it has no rhythm. There are absolutely no gags in this \"screenplay\" with absolutely no structure. It\u00b4s filled with cliches; 5 minutes-in, you can guess what\u00b4s going to happen in the last scene. Basically, this film is garbage."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "This movie is of course a dumb comedy meant for little kids. There's really no reason to watch it, but it wasn't as horrendous as I had feared.  Most of the jokes are pretty stupid and the characters can really start to grate the nerves at times.  I did like how the movie showed that modern children have no discipline, and Crystal's bewilderment at someone even mentioning Facebook or twitter was somewhat amusing, but these things can't save it from predictability, blandness, and annoying characters.  However, if you are forced to watch it, it won't kill you."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Billy crystal in a crappy kids film? Seriously....... This was a really bad film. Very bad. It was not even a great kids film...... It's was  garbage. The end is predictable, the kids don't make everything funny and billy crystal sucks at being a grandpa. 0/10 for me. I suggest you stay away from this film..."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Parental Guidance starts with promising first 10 minutes but finishes as dime-a-dozen family comedy. Good, clean fun and pulling some heartstrings along the way guaranteed."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "An overall refreshing family comedy, Parental Guidance is a moral-filled and hilarious tale for all ages.  Billy Crystal and Bette Midler do a wonderful job as grandparents, and the children have memorable personalities.  There's also many laugh-out-loud moments and some nice insight on the importance of intergenerational wisdom and remaining close to your family, no matter what the circumstances.\r Discerning parents do need to know however that despite being free of any language problems or bartending scenes, Crystal and Midler still provide some mostly mild adult humor.  Also, there's also a few toilet humor jokes and a few moments of mischief/obnoxiousness.  Still though, its a movie parents with kids ages 7 and up will enjoy.\r For a more detailed review, visit www.moviestakenseriously.blogspot.com."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "I had to come to this movie mainly because my friend was going and I thought it would be a nice funny movie.

This film has plenty of laughs, emotion, and outright charm to keep a family continually coming back for more. The acting is great, the laughs are outstanding, the characters memorable, even the emotional scenes are very well done. The kids in this movie actually do a very good job.

I love that  the movie was very relatable to your own family experiences as well."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "Billy Crystal's main attempt at comedy is his failure to move along with a new age, and his voice. A weak script, rather disdainful and annoying acting by the cast, especially Marisa Tomei. In fact, the family just seems to be the typical case of dysfunction, thus making the film a pathetic slapstick comedy, similar to Sandler films. It's boring, weak, and overall, unfunny to a serious point."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Funny and heartwarming comedy about kids, parents, and grandparents.  Realistic while exploring all the relationships such as mom & daughter, older mom & grown up daughter, grown up daughter with older dad, and the relationships each child has with his grandma and grandpa.\r Also explores older marital situations and marital situations for current parents raising kids. Well done and most people I talk to love this movie, but the ones that do not tend to like it think heartwarming is all bull or \"Hollywood\".   I see heartwarming things every day with my kids, this movie helps those try to find those situations in their own life."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "i seen parental guidance to many times .

Billy Crystal and Bette Midler did a solid job as quirky grandparents. I enjoyed the backhanding of new age parenting somewhat ...\r The Bad: ... but the state of the family involved was way too over the top, complete with children that had every issue that you can think of. The screwball grandparents didn't seem like the problem, though the film at times tried to reinforce the notion that they were. It also felt like a sitcom as opposed to a movie, complete with musical cues. I kept waiting for the laugh track to play."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "An entertaining and amusing family movie. There are a few good jokes and the acting was good. I don't get the critics hate toward good movies sometimes. This isn't Oscar worthy nor was it ever meant to be. The whole idea of new age parenting styles vs. old school parenting was a very good idea. The kids are good actors and each bring there own unique personality to the role. Billy crystal and bette midler does a great job as the old school grand parents. This movie is not crystals best but he is still good in this. while the whole thing is very predictable and the actors are not given much to work with this movies is a nice relaxing Sunday afternoon type movie that is not anything outstanding but good clean well made family fun that people of all ages are sure to enjoy."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "Have you ever heard a \"Back in my day...\" joke?

It's not much more than a somewhat 'cute' comedy about a set of quirky grandparents that has a theme based of the diverse age gaps of the characters. With that being said, the movie is solid in a lot of the things it tries to do. Billy and Bette work quite nicely as grandparents and there are some laughs thrown in as well. Definetly not the highest quality viewing, but a decent pick if your just in the mood for a light hearted comedy."}], "recommendations": ["neighbors", "ted", "fred_claus", "good_boys", "blended", "sisters", "night_at_the_museum", "step_brothers", "meet_the_fockers", "bad_santa", "old_school", "superbad", "american_pie", "the_night_before", "17_again", "alvin_and_the_chipmunks_the_road_chip", "neighbors_2_sorority_rising", "bad_moms", "you_again", "bedtime_stories", "blockers", "easy_a", "hall_pass", "a_bad_moms_christmas", "the_40_year_old_virgin"]}
