I appreciate that he doesn't dwell on exposition and just throws you into a partially evolved story.  Joel Edgerton is terrific in this film, as is Adam Driver - neither of whom did I realize were in it.  But the actor who plays the boy - who was in St. Vincent - is amazing."

Because in reality this film is merely but an emotional journey and whether what happens on the screen makes sense or not is not really important.  And you cannot really even pinpoint the genre: is it a film about parenthood, or about a getaway, or maybe perhaps about a religion and the need to believe, or even is it simply a science fiction thriller? Whatever it is Mike Nichols delivers once again a thoroughly enjoyable film with an amazing cast including Michael Shannon, Joel Edgerton, Adam Driver, Sam Shepard and of course the young Jaeden Lieberher."

      "text": "Midnight Special is a good old- school science fiction movie. The acting is superb from all the people involved, not to mention the great special effects. The most unique thing about this though is the way the story is told. The film starts right during the action and we the audience only see a dad running away with his son, who has unexplained supernatural powers. The government and a religious Texas ranch are after the boy for reasons we don't know. But the story ingeniously reveals what's going on, the backstory, and the plot in teaspoon fulls. More information is told as the film goes on. This way, the audience gets engrossed into the story as things are revealed to them along the way and the conclusion becomes unpredictable. There's just an original feel to all of this with good action and suspense. However, once the ending does come up, this original story cops out to an E.T.- esque ending in which many questions are left simply unanswered and unexplained. While details are revealed during the story, not enough of them are given. In addition, the pacing is too slow in certain areas, thus cutting down the tension. Overall though, this mostly different and original sci- fi film mostly succeeds."

      "text": "Midnight Special is a wonderfully unique and adventurous film. The acting across the board is very good, but the real star here are the technical elements. The special effects are terrific, especially in a scene where we see the boy with his eyes and the light coursing through his veins. The ending sequence also features terrific special effects and give the film a feeling along the lines of Spielberg's 70s and 80s science fiction classics due to the sense of wonder it inspires. The sense of mystery is highlighted by the film's synth-like score that really threatens to steal the show at times. Its low notes put you right on the edge and add this air of mystery that leaves you guessing until the very end. The lighting and cinematography are also top-notch, especially with the film largely taking place at night. It is always hard to shoot at night, but Midnight Special makes it look easy and, even better, the lighting lets you see everything, yet keep enough shrouded in darkness to make it both visually pleasing and mysterious. This film has a lot going on, is quite slow, and does not have a pay-off many will appreciate. However, I certainly did appreciate these elements. The slow pacing never arose as an issue because enough is going on to really keep you hooked and zoned in on what is going on in the film. Additionally, the ending is perfect simply because the proceeding 1 hour and 40 minutes were so mysterious. A mysterious ending is the only way to end this one as the characters never showed any level of understanding as to what was happening to the boy. Thus, it only makes sense that they remain in the dark along with us and get looked at as if they are crazy. Overall, Midnight Special is a special film that is wholly unique and highlights that Jeff Nichols is one of the best directors working today."

      "text": "A secret road adventure during the dark hours!\r So the Jeff Nichols and Micahel Shannon saga continues. This is theirs 4th film together in the last nine years and all of them were well accepted. Now they are into sci-fi for this, which is kind of a road movie that resembles hundreds of other films. Only thematically, but in parts it looks different, especially for being too realistic as what the director is famous for. Finally, something is not a comedy or a full of CGI, yet still it is a wonderful sci-fi-drama with some thrill moments.\r It opened like the midway of the story. We obviously have to wait for a proper explanation to know what's going on, who is the child and where they're taking him. So it all begins with two armed men driving a young kid on the dark hours. Only we know is that they are protecting the boy from the government people, but the film took some time to give a clear picture of the condition. In the meantime, I started my prediction game, but I expected the film to clarify how it all began. It never cared about that part, only moved forward and that's how we're going to get some answers where a few might feel its a let down.\r The negative of the film is you won't fully understand it, but it is not an incomplete story, just designed that way that leaves for the viewer to add their own perspectives to where the writer left blank spaces. Like I said the people are comparing it with the similar films and I did not care about that, but I disappointed with the conclusion. It was neatly folded, I actually liked it, but it was not fresh, especially it totally mirrors 'Tomorrowland'. Now I know why Warner Bros moved it from last year to this year's release.\r It might be a coincident because the director who is also the writer has a good reputation, so I believe it is definitely not a steal, just a common creative that we've already seen many films like that. Overall, this film is worth, but might not satisfy the Jeff Nichols fans, because like I said plenty of times before in my reviews, now it the sci-fi era and every filmmaker and film-star want to board on that plane. So it did not spare Jeff Nichols as well.\r 7/10"

      "text": "It's indeed a special science fiction thriller inspired by director/writer Jeff Nichols' own life experience who enjoys telling a story at his own vision that's not intently made for general audiences. The film revolves around a kid with supernatural abilities that has similarities to Spielberg's E.T., Close Encounters of the Third Kind and a little bit of Tomorrowland; its thin plot progresses slowly, less family friendly and humorless but it manages to engage audiences by triggering the eagerness to crack for all secrets behind the mystery. The entire journey is dangerous and emotional thanks to the outstanding performance by Michael Shannon as a caring father and well supported by the charming performance of the son by Jaeden Lieberher. It has limited but powerful scores, it does not reveal all secrets and end ambiguously, rather most importantly the science fiction acts as a metaphor to the beauty of parenthood - faith and sacrifice of parents to ensure the happiness of their children."

We know very little at the beginning of the film, and the gaps are filled in along the way, at a natural pace. \"Midnight Special\" is decidedly subtle, for the most part- the one issue I have with the film is that climax actually overplays its hand a bit too much, making the central mystery a bit too physical and literal. The ending remains just ambiguous and emotionally resonant enough for me to swallow the whole final act, however.\rI certainly couldn't find fault with \"Special\"'s cast, which is one for the ages. The consistently great Michael Shannon manages to be startlingly heart-wrenching as the lead character, the father of a boy with unexplainable powers; Kirsten Dunst steals the third act of the film with just one reaction shot as the child's mother; Adam Driver is funny and awed as an NSA agent assigned to track the boy; Joel Edgerton is warm and driven as Shannon's second; Sam Shepard is fearsome and smug in a small role as a cult leader; Bill Camp makes for a soulful thug. And Jaeden Lieberher, the boy himself, chooses correctly to make the character the most even-headed of the film.\rThe film is masterfully directed by Jeff Nichols; one gorgeous shot I can recall immediately is of military vehicles rolling over a hilly road just as the sun is coming up. The score is a bit of an earworm, and sets the tone of the film well.\rI've hesitated to include anything regarding the plot of this movie, but I hope I've established its best elements. Please, go see it, as it's one of the best of the year so far."

      "text": "A Highly Disappointing SF Film Mashup\r *** Spoilers ***\r It's partially the casting, partially the direction sinking this film. Mostly it's a script cobbed together from \"ET,\" \"Starman,\" a dash of \"CE3K,\" the Superman legend, \"Village of the Damned,\" and generic child-in-jeopardy tale. That's the most amazing, and disappointing, aspect of \"Midnight Special\" - that the creative and original Jeff Nichols wrote a shamefully derivative script filled with plot holes large enough to fly a mothership through.\r After a mysterious, compelling first act, \"Midnight Special\" turns into a boring chase/race-against-time story of an extraordinary, luminous boy with 'powers and abilities far beyond that of mortal men' sought by the Feds and a cultish church who venerate him because he speaks coordinates in tongues. This boy comes from \"a world-on-world\" whose inhabitants watch over us. (Given the state of the world, they're doing a crappy job.) The explanation tracks more like angels from another dimension than aliens.\r The boy, played by Jaeden Lieberher, fails to create sympathy through all the chaos. The wonderful Kirsten Dunst has never been more wasted in a placeholder role as the boy's mom. Shannon is his hulking father. Edgerton only serviceable as a tag along State Trooper. They dodge bullets on a lumbering path to specific Florida coordinates where the boy has a date with destiny; the merging of dimension X and our pitiful dimension. Other luminous beings spirit the boy away and POOF - the convergence disappears. Big deal! A most unsatisfying and anticlimactic end that does not inspire the wonder the special effects technicians hoped it would despite Mom's mugging at the otherworldly architecture.\r It might occur this is a Jesus allegory with a 'birth' of a messiah from common parents. There's not a glimmer of that (save some 'fire from Heaven'). Early on, there was promise of social commentary about our over-surveilled lives. Nope. That's not present either. Also lacking, commentary about people steeping in religious fervor to fill absences in themselves. The church members, including Sam Shepherd, are bland.\r \"Midnight Special\" adds no subtext to a story begging for some. Even the title derived from the song doesn't track. \"Let the Midnight Special shine a light on me.\" Okay, he did shine light, but the Feds - after everyone within a hundred mile radius sees the other world - still prosecute and jail Dad and the Trooper. That we're deaf, dumb and blind in a mysterious Universe is not a lot to be left with after two hours.\r Too much mystery ruins a film - the slight flash of light in Dad's eyes at fade out an example. Without the proper setup, too much mystery makes \"Midnight Special\" an uncooked, epic misfire in this dimension or any other. Give it a pass."

I'm certain there's a deeper meaning, but unlike Jeff Nichols' previous work, which I've loved, I don't feel the slightest bit compelled to dig deeper. It's essentially a religious E.T. flick. The only problem, is that it's never clear what the significance of this religious figure of a kid really is. Maybe it's worth a second viewing to find out more, but the frustrating amount of ambiguity is daunting to even think about.\r The cast is mostly great - Adam Driver being a particularly fun addition, simply because of his character's comedic awkwardness and overall relatable lack of understanding. I took issue with Jaeden Lieberher's performance - he plays Alton, the Jesus-angel-kid - simply because he lacked emotion for most of the movie. He was a stoic mystery, which is fine on paper, but it's not a character you can relate to - especially considering all of what he's been through during the events of the film.\r It's difficult to play off faith in something, and while Midnight Special makes it absolutely clear that whatever Alton's goal is, it's the real deal, I couldn't help but feel everyone was just blindly following him. I was expecting Alton to have some kind of darker role in the grand scheme of things, but in the end, I can't really say he even has a good role.

I think Michael Shannon's a great actor but he has one expression throughout the entire movie. The kid has no personality whatsoever and just sits there like a lemon for most of the film. The plot unfolds slowly in a contrived manner which aims to tease you whereas I ended up just saying, 'please, someone, just fill us in.' Everybody knows more than they divulge to the viewer from the get go and the result of this is that things move along very slowly with nothing significant happening for ages. I tuned out by the end and put on my headphones in, whilst on the screen I could see that the payload does arrive eventually, but too little too late."
