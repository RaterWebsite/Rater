      "text": "I'll admit it, I could barely make it through the trailer. And I get that I'm not its target demographic. Still, I have to say that this is the most vapid doc I can think of. This person isn't even real anymore, and that is a shame. Somewhere in there is a real person that has been beaten into a psychological corner whether they wanted that or not. Their entire life is artifice, and this mockumentary might as well be true for Justin. No amount of money would get most of us to give up who we are. I don't think he ever had a choice."
