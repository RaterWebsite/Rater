      "text": "So it's not a wonderful life; so they lied. Lying awake at night, Shrek, a husband and father of triplets, undergoes an existential crisis, as Fiona sleeps soundly, oblivious to the paradox that vexes her domesticated spouse, who misses the ogre condition of alienation and veneration. The sheer awe that Shrek's size and stature commanded from the townsfolk, in hindsight, so he thinks, was adequate compensation for his lonely bachelor life in the swamp. The marital bed, suddenly a coffin instead of a haven, inspires Shrek to take out a \"Wanted\" poster, the highlight of his outlaw notoriety, from the dresser-drawer and affixes the ephemeralia to the mirror, creating a jarring disconnect with the ogre's reflected self. Shrek realizes that he's half an ogre; his resentment lies in incubation 'til the next day at the birthday party, where he reveals his true colors. In the 1947 Frank Capra classic that loosely informs \"Shrek Forever After\", George Bailey(Jimmy Stewart), the stabilizing force of Bedford Falls, matches the ogre's disenchantment with being a household patriarch, in the housewarming scene where Mary(Donna Reed) gives her wanderlust husband a knitted picture that reads: \"George lassos the moon.\" Like the lunar surface, Shrek can be his own man in the swamp, lonely, but away from the pressures of being a husband and father. In the Capra film, Mary doesn't realize the double-edged significance of the moon; she sees the sphere as merely a romantic object, and not an object of despair, the final outpost for George's wandering spirit. Like \"It's a Wonderful Life\", one wish made in haste and self-absorption transforms a town and its people for the worse. Rumplestilskin's rave hints at the noirish qualities of Pottersville, since a rave promotes bacchanalia and in this instance, a means of institutional control. The witches turn into good-time party girls as FarFarAway Land becomes a fertile ground for intolerance and nihilism."

Shrek is tired of his life as a harmless ogre and wants to be like he was before he met his friends, so he makes a deal with Rumplestilskin and his life changes exactly like that, with a lot of dislike for this new life. Beware of a dissappointing ending that makes the Shrek series leave too soon. Other than the ending, I think you'll have reasons to enjoy Shrek Forever After."

Yes, it helps that this one is in 3-D \u2013 the real deal, not a retrofit \u2013 that makes the action pop. But it's the characters that pull us in when familiarity flatlines our interest.  The plot gimmick involves husband-and-father Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers with just the right blend of mirth and malaise) feeling frustrated that his days as a fear-inducing ogre are over. So he makes a deal with Rumpelstiltskin (an ingeniously nasty vocal turn from DreamWorks Animation story editor Walt Dohrn) that tricks him into an alternate universe where he doesn't know his wife, Fiona (Cameron Diaz), his friend Donkey (Eddie Murphy) or fat-cat Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas). It's a fun ride. What's missing is the excitement of a new interpretation."

Now, the fourth one trots along (to the chagrin of some filmgoers) and touts itself as the \"final\" film in the series (though, of course, the recent announcement from DreamWorks that \"Shrek 5\" is being developed and planned for release in 2019/2020 renders that point essentially moot). How does the series end off? Well, pretty well, all things considered. Let's get it out of the way now: \"Shrek Forever After\" definitely feels like a retread. It's not the most original story in the world, and that might contribute to the notion that the franchise has lost its way. That said, it's still wonderfully animated, considerably charming and humorous, and it features some great, entertaining characters, ranging from great returning characters to exciting new characters (such as Rumpelstiltskin). Sure, the \"Shrek\" franchise may have lost its way, and it's no longer the animated juggernaut that it was in the early 2000's, but overall, \"Shrek Forever After\" is a considerably entertaining romp that the whole family can enjoy."

      "text": "Although I love animation, I've never been a fan of the Shrek franchise.  This movie took me by surprise.  The first Shrek movie was good (not great) thanks to Eddie Murphy, but Shrek 2 was awful.  I never saw the 3rd installment.  I've never liked the weird Irish accent for Shrek that Mike Myers provides.  It doesn't fit for me and I find it distracting.  Why is he Irish when nobody else is?  My friend talked me into going to see this one and it turned out to be a good animated movie - maybe even the best of the Shrek movies.  The script is WAY better than Shrek 2 and had some good laughs and good animation and it held my attention the entire way.  The 3D was good, not great, and probably not worth the extra cost, as 3D mutes the colors due to the dark glasses."
