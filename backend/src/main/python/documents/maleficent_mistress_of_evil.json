This second installment does not match the previous one. Spend a lot of time rambling and avoiding to arrive at 2 hours. VERY SLOW and in essence almost nothing happens. Angelina eats the movie, Disney really knew how to choose it very well. Michelle Pfeiffer as the human villain who wants to end all rare beings and that the world is only human does well. On the other hand we see that Maleficent finds other Dark Fairies equal to her and that reminded me a lot of How to train your dragon 3, but this one is badly told compared to the other.

Some have been better than others but none have been transcendental or worth remembering. After all the animated classics remain classic and they're better.Maleficent was a strange case, especially as they altered the plot in order to make her the main character and eventually the heroine.I didn't find anything interesting in that film and personally I didn't like it but since it was a huge blockbuster, the sequel was inevitable.Maleficent: Mistress of Evil comes to repeat the formula on a larger scale. Typical in this type of sequels but like its predecessor it makes the mistake of taking itself too seriously and the dramatic overload is ridiculous.Beyond how artificial everything feels, the film fails to make its plot useful or more interesting and honestly everything becomes boring quickly.I had no expectations therefore I cannot declare it disappointing, simply forgettable and therefore this is definitely an option that I would not recommend."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Se o primeiro filme j\u00e1 \u00e9 ruim o sua sequencia n\u00e3o foi diferente, nem o grande elenco pode salvar esse novo filmes, est\u00e1 na hora da Disney repensar seus filmes live-action"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Amazing to watch!awesome visuals and score does a fair portrayal to fairy tale!amazing acting especially angelina jolie she played maleficient perfectly her expression charisma are well suited!amazing ending quite expected yet amazing to watch!michell piffer was amazing playing kindof villianish because she does that for humans so has her reasons portrayed well by her!overall a good movie not as good as first one but yaa!"}, {"rating": "1", "text": "Maybe I have entirely different expectations from everyone else, but, this movie was an abysmal flop.  The story arc was patently predictable.  Aside from the first half hour, Maleficent had very few lines and felt absent from much of the movie; with more silent reactions than talking The \"meet the parents\" dinner scene was the only redeeming exchange between characters. Instead of a children's movie, it felt like a mixture of The Lord of the Rings meets Game of Thrones, especially when the Queen Ingrith/Michelle Pfieffer (read; Cersei) character was poisoning her husband, locking innocents in a church to be poison gassed, and standing on a tower directing war. How disappointing."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "This time, the film didn't really continue the creative choices he made. Elements of war that were presented did not get enough depth, instead appearing so one-dimensional. The film assures humans as the first invaders. A queen made purely evil for no apparent reason, or even ridiculous depending on where we look. The uniqueness of the main characters had to be sacrificed. Watching this is like watching a big fireball, the visuals can be beautiful but inside there is a hot-mess, unfortunately we can't possibly expect a better story to come from the ashes later. There's no bounce back from characters who have lost their uniqueness."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "The plot make no sense. Characters dies and other characters will forget about them the next scene.

This painstakingly derivative tale of betrayal and reconciliation through self-forgiveness had already been told by the first iteration of Maleficent in a much more poetic and contained manner, the second delivery fails at everything the first one got right and ultimately reduces the character it tried to bring to new heights to a completely unconvincing and ridiculous thing which is no longer unique or interesting."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "I\u2019d give it a C+/B-.

Great special effects, character designs, and acting. It\u2019s simply magical. Michelle Pfeiffer kills it as the evil Queen Ingrith in a way that just makes you hate her guts. The only negatives I would remark on is the dramatic and abrupt change in tone after the war scene. It doesn't fit well going into the final act (seeming shoe-horned in). Especially considering the queens high treason and war crimes where she gets off basically scott-free and where her and the other's misdeeds are quickly pardoned and forgotten about. There are additional story inconsistencies regarding the crimson powders effects from the first half of the story to the second half. But all-in-all, worth watching."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I liked this, but there are some caveats.First off: this movie looks great from the effects to the creature design to the costumes. It just has this great fairy tale fantasy look to it.Loved the world building in this. You get a lot better feel for the human society here. A new group of fairies appear in this and they are given more detail than expected with various subsets with their own costumes and customs.Found the pacing better than the last film, which had a lot of editing from the original cut from what I hear. I also appreciated that this movie was trying to be more of a crowd-pleaser. The last film's moments of harsh emotional darkness did feel like it was trying too hard to be edgy at times. However, I admit that that it did have some great character and dialogue moments with Aurora and Maleficent that Mistress of Evil lacks.Again, Angelina Jolie is the best part, stealing whatever scene she is in. She delivers the best emotional moments of the film. I was disappointed that the villain's henchwoman Gerda (Jenn Murray) is used sparingly. She is the competent and straight-to-the-task type. She evokes this odd uncomfortableness and does a lot with very few lines of dialogue.The movie's biggest problem is that it's like Tron Legacy in that the director/screenwriters found ways to depict murders without graphic violence and they felt that that justified them going crazy with them. I found the amount of death went farther than it needed for a family film. To compound the matter, the rushed feel-good ending really feels in conflict with the events that took place before it.The movie juggles way too many characters. The creators really didn't know what to do with Maleficent's sidekick Diaval (Sam Riley). Michelle Pfeiffer's duplicitous Queen Ingrith's scene time could've been cut. She was an okay villain who I think could've been stronger if her characteristics hadn't gotten old after a while. Also, Maleficent, the star of the film, is only in it half the time.Despite these legitimate flaws, I still enjoyed myself. This movie is basically fantasy porn. Just understand that this is one of those cases where you're willing to shut your brain off."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "The second chapter of this film partly looks more confident than first chapter.

It is a spectacle for the eyes. I guess that's its main reason for existence - selling 3D movie tickets, and selling merchandise to children.I find it somewhat disappointing, because there was the potential for a good story here. If children were the main target audience, the story could've been simpler. Instead, I felt like I watched a mish-mash of different stories and characters, all somehow exploiting a Disney's established franchise. It's confused and confusing.So, we got Mad queen Cersei; a weak king; a weaker prince; a useless, weak princess (why?); General Black Man; Maleficent Targaryen; comedic relief Grima Wormtongue; Thor's Heimdall mixed with Gandhi; Bird man William Wallace; the Avatar creatures, but with less blue, and more wings; Sonic's useless hedgehog niece; and finally, perhaps the best character: Lesbian psychopath murderer.Why are they all in the same movie, and why is this a Lord of the Rings war meets Game of Thrones scheming meets Dances with Wolves?

Ideally it would've been a solid 8. Maleficent: Mistress Of Evil reminds us how Maleficent will always be mistreated for just being a horned-winged scary looking fairy and how her heart is bigger than what many people would think it is. Michelle Pfeifer/Queen Ingrith was the strong antagonist figure to the strong Maleficent, something the first film lacked.

However, his mother (Michelle Pfeiffer) has other plans that involve eliminating Maleficent (Angelina Jolie, who's so made up and stolid she could have been computer generated) and her kingdom.

It's enjoyable to watch but the story is fully of nonsense."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Well well...I was certainly not expecting such an improvement over the first movie. It's definitely darker and more brutal than expected and also much better directed. Good camera work, elaborate costumes and stunning set pieces one after the other. The CGI looks amazing too showing this is truly an expensive and well crafted movie rich in details and visual beauty. The script doesn't offer an original and groundbreaking story but it's well written with some witty dialogues and a focused narrative that's easy to follow. While the phoned twists might appear naive for adults I am sure kids will enjoy this elegant film about self discovery, family, war, loss, friendship, love, hate and everything in between. Elle as Aurora has one intense scene where she is showing some skills as an acretess but overall gives a flat performance yet she is never the key protagonist of the story so in the end she seems an OK choice to portray an innocent and naive girl with a pure heart. She is still very likeable and never gets on your nerves as many Disney princesses. The Prince of the other hand is ridiculous. The two protagonists here are Angie and Michelle, both stunningly beautiful and immensely talented and good in their roles. Queen Ingrid is evil and her story perfectly justifies the first movie and the original story of The Sleeping Beauty. Maleficent goes through a self discovery journey rising above all. The movie is a good spectacle, aesthetically flawless, with great characters and a convincing plot. It's not a masterpiece but a very good sequel and a fun night out at the theatre. IMAX or Laser 4K is recommended. The UHD Blu Ray seems a must given the high number of beautiful Angelina close ups, HDR and Dolby Vision will make the movie pop so nicely.
