In other words, my expectations were sufficiently such that I actually enjoyed it quite a bit.  For edge-of-your-seat thrills, it's a nice companion piece to Unstoppable. Don't expect a ton of depth, but it's worth seeing."

Then it takes us on a journey of one man's answer and the conviction it delivered.The direction is perfect, and you can really see how that compliments the acting.  Haggis, Banks and Crowe are a fantastic pairing.I'm a little upset this fared so poorly with critics, because it means we may not see more of this magic."

However, it seems a bit long and lacks the necessary constant suspense throughout the entire first half. Paul Haggis did a great job with the story though, with unexpected twists & turns, and a nice emotional scene with Brian Dennehy. Plus, he also tied up the loose ends by the end of the film, which left me satisfied. But I didn't leave the theater wanting to watch it again and again."

When it's clear that she'll never be able to prove her innocence, he determines to break her out. Most of the movie is spent with his deliberate planning and setbacks, which is involving, but not particularly exciting. The escape ramps up the rate and generates some mild tension. Ultimately, it's a competent, but unmemorable film."

      "text": "It's all about plans and logistics.  If you love details and preparation methodology laced with tension and a dash of whodunnit, then this movie is for you.  I imagine a limited audience section who would raise their hands to say they would rather see the event planning rather than the event itself.  Unlike most prison break films, this movie shows the reality and consequences of following through on the prison escape fantasy.  Bravo on that.  The act of actually breaking a human being out of jail is not guns blazing, good aim, and luck with traffic patterns.  It must require step by step coordintion, study, and run throughs.  Unfortunately, filming those actions to make them engaging for an audience is not easy and is not accomplished here.  I was very surprised to see at the end that this was written and directed by Paul Haggis (Crash).  But it does explain why a film as uninteresting as this has such a superior cast.  Too bad the material they are working with does not match their abilities.  Liam Neeson shows up for one scene and comes away as the most interesting character in the movie.  While sitting through all of this planning, routine, and even more planning, I noticed a very good soundtrack.  He uses a bunch of Moby songs throughout which is good and one of them is called \"Mistake\".  Is this the director attempting to foreshadow for the musically astute?  I also noticed that the Pittsburgh police department is oddly efficient and display outstanding time management.  Their hunches and ability to acquire mismatched clues are without peer.  Russell Crowe would have done much better against the bumbling Baltimore police department featured in The Wire.  Also, Elizabeth Banks looks goregeous for a woman who spends a significant amount of time behind bars.  I could not recommend this film to anyone I know; no one would thank me for that.  For prison escape fans, go rent the first season of the series Prison Break instead."

There was less action than I was expecting, and while it started slow, about halfway through I was leaning forward in suspense.  I had watched \"The Town\" recently (which I also liked), and compare this movie favorably to that film.  The action was low-key, the drama was taut, and I was drawn in and started caring about the characters.  I was actually a bit sad that the film ended without giving me a bit of an epilogue."

Forget that the movie never explains what the mountain of evidence against her is (so we have no idea how he really feels).  Forget that their child is an undeveloped afterthought/appendage.  Forget that the main premise of the movie is completely unrealistic.  What's left?  This is maybe the worst movie Paul Haggis has directed (you can't count the terrible \"Terminator Salvation\", as he was only one of many writers on that POS; and  \"In the Valley of Elah\" which was not good, was not this bad).  Russell Crowe has been a very good actor is some great films (The Insider, Gladiator, A Beautiful Mind, Cinderella Man and 3:10 to Yuma).  But this is not one of them.  It is terribly ironic how a good actor and director can team up for this mess.  Bummer.  I hoped for better."

It's as though they had a beginning and and end but the middle was made up as they went along.  I literally thought the movie was coming to and end when I looked at the running time and I was only an hour and 19 minutes into it! I had over an hour left! Some things happened in the movie that will make you dislike the two main characters and wonder why some of the talent that was in this movie even agreed to do it in the first place. And I'm not talking about Russel Crowe.One thing I thought was very odd was the way the guards at the prison acted around the visitors. The visitors were treated as though they were criminals also and were always \"glaring\" at Russell Crowe's character even before he started acting odd when he came to visit. It's a small little nitpick but it just gives you a sense of how the rest of the movie was directed.If you're looking for a suspenseful, exciting movie don't let the trailer fool you, this movie will make you angry you even spent the dollar at \"Redbox\""

What do you do when your options are low and good enough isn't good enough?  Possible answers exist in this movie about a family whose life takes a turn for the worst when the mother gets charged for murder.  I'm loving the level of darkness and suspense.  Really makes you question life, the good and bad things that happen to you, and how you handle it.  The movie left me feeling mostly satisfied.  Though, still.. felt a little empty.  Like still dealing with the aftermath of how to really take in what I just witnessed.  All-in-all, it is rare for me to not be able to guess the ending, so that's a plus for the movie makers.  I wouldn't mind seeing an alternate ending.  And I would love to see a sequel.  Gain closure and more positivity.  I love the cast.  I cannot think of a single Russell Crowe movie that I do not like, except for maybe Beautiful Mind.  Elizabeth Banks - not her typical role, she did a great job though.  She's one of my favorite actresses.  I also enjoyed seeing Liam Neeson & Olivia Wilde and that d00d Michael from Jericho, and the guy from Ultimate Gift.This movie reminds me of the McStay family (they went missing in California a year or 2 ago).  And all the other people who have to go through tough situations such as this in real life.  I pray that they can all receive the justice they deserve.Now go see a comedy after you watch this movie.  You'll need it."

      "text": "Did she do it? Did Laura Brennan(Elizabeth Banks), wife and mother, bludgeon her boss to death with a fire extinguisher? This woman's innocence or guilt is the meat of \"The Next Three Days\", a thriller that's so preoccupied with her husband's walk on the unseemly side of life, Laura's innocence or guilt becomes beside the point, when compared to showing at what lengths an erudite husband, a college English professor, would go to prove his love. Since Russell Crowe cuts a rather physically imposing figure, the filmmaker doesn't have at his disposal, the option of exploiting the absurdity inherent in an intellectual being forced to remake himself as an action hero. One day, John Brennan is teaching \"Don Quixote\" to a roomful of eager freshman, and before you know it, he's burning down a crystal meth lab and shooting men in cold blood. Although this isn't the first time Crowe finds himself playing an egghead(he was, of course, John Forbes Nash in \"A Beautiful Mind\"), the Aussie actor's thick-set body, angry scowl, and reputation as a brawler(all three factors even more pronounced than it was back in 2001), would make him ill-suited to play the game theory genius had the Ron Howard film been shot today, let alone, a professor at a community college. Crowe is badly miscast; he's neither vulnerable enough(like a Billy Bob Thornton), nor downright prissy enough(like a Patrick Wilson) to walk into a gun store, and ask for a clerk's assistance in locating the spot where the bullets go. The first chance John gets to discharge his firearm(the shakedown of the aforementioned ice house), he looks competent, like a seasoned cop, or criminal. He's a good shot. Not for one second does the moviegoer fear for his safety. Aaron Eckhart(who played an English professor in Neal LaBute's \"Possession\") would remember to look scared. Worst of all, the academic mindset to ask questions is what's missing from this husky brainiac. Rather than bust Laura out of jail, why doesn't John harness all that brain power toward proving his wife's innocence? Because of the professor's reluctance to inquire about the day in question, he never learns about the button that Laura lost after she collided with the real murderer? Most educators, at the very least, would return to the scene of the crime and attempt to reconstruct the sequence of events leading up to the murder, then canvass the immediate vicinity in search of witnesses who might've crossed paths with the sociopathic bag lady. By not doing so, there's the implication that John presumes his wife is guilty, in which plotting her jailbreak becomes, by default, the only option available to this desperate husband. \"The Next Three Days\", however, is as thick-headed as its hero. John never wavers from his belief in Laura's innocence, but the film fails to realize that somebody from the academic arena might have conceivably played amateur sleuth at the outset(since there's some overlap between detective work and scholastic work), and only after failing to turn up any evidence, as a last resort, would an English professor play the vigilante card."

I went into watching the movie not know a whole lot about the movie except that I tend to like most thrillers.  This one is kind of long  2 hrs 20 minutes. Its slightly slow for a thriller till the last half hour. Really I thought the entire movie beautifully filmed and constructed except for the slowness.  Of course the plot is not very plausible but what they heck do you expect from a thriller  --there has to be some suspension of belief on the part of the viewer. Haggis is remaking a 2008 French film titled \"Anything for Her,\"   I did not see it  (not out here on DVD yet) .  I think the film is much better than the 50 % assigned to it on Rotten Tomatoes. I read a lot thrillers in book format and this is a completely acceptable thriller on film--but still a TAD slow.

I am SO delighted I saw it on the big screen.Moving performances by all three: Russell Crowe, Elizabeth Banks, and Brian Dennehy (who really was a standout).  I was just SURE Dennehy would get an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his performance.  Several critics mentioned it.  I hate it that the Academy only seems to nominate films based on true stories or animated films.  Very little else seems to get any attention from them.  And this was an incredible film.

The Next Three Days is thrilling and entertaining, but far too outlandish and typical to be anything but average. This is quite distressing, given that it was directed by Paul Haggis and starred Russell Crowe and Elisabeth Banks. With two good leads and a talented director, it is correct to hope for a better than average and generic film. It can certainly entertain and it is fun to watch the film unfold, so it delivers that entertainment value for sure, but it never aspires to be more than a run-of-the-mill thriller. Even worse, it is shot like an episode of some bad cop show. The Next Three Days may or may not have been a movie I had seen before today. I cannot really remember. Sadly, however, it is so generic that this feeling of deja vu may simply be due to that."

Yet once you start getting closer to the big finale of the movie, that's when you know it starts to boost up the story and starts becoming more and more intense in storytelling. But by the finale of the movie just becomes better than expected. As far as acting goes, it's Russell Crowe (John) who steals the show with his great performance (like usual). It was also nice to see Elizabeth Banks (Lara) take on this type of role. She's usually known for being in other comedies with Paul Rudd. But taking the role of a convicted mother was utterly winning to watch. The reason I give it a 7 is mostly because of the slowness of pace during the middle part of the movie.
