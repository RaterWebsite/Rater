  "description": "A team of space marines known as the Rapid Response Tactical Squad, led by Sarge, is sent to a science facility on Mars after somebody reports a security breach. There, they learn that the alert came after a test subject, a mass murderer purposefully injected with alien DNA, broke free and began killing people. Dr. Grimm, who is related to team member Reaper, informs them all that the chromosome can mutate humans into monsters -- and is highly infectious.",

He gave a wonderful performance as Sarge. He was very creepy, authoritative and menacing. This is one of the most underrated movies of all time. My real rating would be an 9, but I'm giving it a 10 in order to boost the incredibly low 6.3 it currently has."

      "text": "It actually has surprisingly little to do with the video game(s) it's supposedly based on. It trades the demons in for mutants and lone wolf protagonist for a team of space marines. The only similarities are that it takes place on mars in a facility visually reminiscent of Doom 3. To be honest it has more in common with Aliens.\r Does any of this make it a bad film? No, not really. I mean, don't get me wrong, this is far from the most intelligent sci-fi movie there. It's definitely filled to the brim with cheese at times, but I still found myself having a lot of fun with this campy, action-horror flick.\r Admittedly it's not that hard to think that we could've had a pretty great Aliens rip-off had the doubled down more on the horror and left the cheesier moments out. In typical video game movie fashion we get elements thrown in meant specifically for the teenage gaming crowd.\r There's a scene of gratuitous nudity and the dialog is far from Shakespearean. Mix that in with moments of intentionally goofy humor and you have a movie that doesn't always take itself seriously. There's also Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson's super over-the-top performance. However when it's firing on all cylinders and focusing on the great cast shooting up monsters in dark corridors it's hard to not enjoy yourself.\r The action itself is mostly well done. It gets a little too over-the-top at times with the way it occasionally sends it's character careening through the air in an unintentionally comical fashion, but it's suitably gory and can get pretty tense in that special action movie way. There's a sequence in the movie that takes place in first-person as a throwback to the games that's just awesome.\r While an extra dose of seriousness would have gone a long way, Doom is a pretty great movie. While the actual plot has little to do with the games, there are enough references to satisfy fans. Saying it's not as terrible as other video game movies isn't really saying much. However even when viewed outside of the video game movie spectrum it's still pretty great in it's own ways. The horror angle, while underutilized, did help give it a more serious tone to keep viewers invested longer. Not to mention it's got great action and a (mostly) stellar cast. Video game movies are rarely worth watching, but this one proves to be one of those rare exceptions to the rule. So long as you can put up with some camp and cheese that is."

Oddly enough, this is one of Johnson's better roles and Urban does a fine job as well. I was totally convinced in each character and I loved the the Olduvai setting. Perhaps one of the best video game to film conversions I've seen."

      "text": "A recent NY Times review called this movie \"really just a formulaic shoot'em-up, with dead bodies amassing on the floor of an underground Martian laboratory\". Wasn't that most of what the game itself was? For those looking for a best picture nominee, don't waste your time with this movie; however that was clearly not its intention. This movie was made as a tribute to the grandaddy of one of the most popular game genres of all time, first person shooters, and Doom the game has been copied and mimicked in games more than Star Wars has in movies. So for those critics that watched this movie expecting an Oscar-worthy performance from the rock, try first looking at the source of this movie, the game itself, which was exactly what every FPS fan loved, and exactly what you'll find in this movie, nothing but a shoot 'em up. By the way I personally think Karl Urban did a great job in this movie, and my personal complaint would be that he should have taken more of a larger role in the script of the movie. If you are looking for a real heartwarming movie, this is a tribute to a gory video game; if you are looking for a recreation of a video game, this is limited by the fact that it is just a movie. With the understanding of the difficulties the director had in this balancing act, I was still very much entertained and would recommend it to any FPS fan."

Unfortunately, this was largely because I think the game is a much better, more entertaining effort than a film which, as usual, discards the more interesting story and graphic elements of the source material in favor of some lame screen writer and director's notions of what the game was about. On the plus side, it did have an interesting twist at the end that I thought was atypical of this sort of film, and it did evoke some of the look and feel of the game. If you want a better reflection of Doom, I suggest double-billing Hellraiser and Aliens."
