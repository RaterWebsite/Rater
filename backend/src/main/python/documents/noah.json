And \"righteous in the eyes of God\" means \"psychotic homicidal maniac\"! And when the Bible says \"Noah and Shem and Ham and Japeth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife and the three wives of his sons with them, entered the ark\" it REALLY means \"Noah, his wife, his kids, Shem's wife, and this guy who snuck on board and tried to kill Noah\"! And those explicit instructions in Genesis for how to build the ark? Really that was a cryptic acid trip where nothing was really explained. Thank you Darren Aronofsky for setting me straight. I thought that I knew how to read, but apparently I was wrong! And thank you Russel Crowe for your most dynamic performance yet!\r for those who can't tell, this is all sarcasm."

If you are going to do a historic piece, you should at least try to keep the story correct. only the names re the same and there is an arc full of animals and birds, etc.  that is where it ends being the story of noah.  Cain kills Able and starts an industrial society, according to the narrator, but since when did people in an industrialized society still run around in ragged clothes and animal skins and use clubs and swords?  And then fallen angels come down to help mankind and are crusted with volcanic rock as punishment from God.  That's so wrong, I'm not even going there. And it just gets worse.  Noah is supposedly given the decision to save or destroy all of mankind, by God, and he chooses to destroy all. so this is offensive  not only Christians, but to anyone who ever saw a great story come to screen, and it was all screwed up by Hollywood."

Settle down. Be thankful that someone in HOLLYWOOD actually made a movie about this biblical tale. Now, time to review.  Darren Aronosky (hope I spelled that right) is at it again with one of the most destructive and action-packed tales from the Bible. Who better to do it? Noah is a home run in terms of movie making and sits along with Requiem of a Dream and Black Swan in a stalemate. Everybody in the movie does a fantastic job and all feel equal in terms of skill and screen time. While it doesn't have as much action as you'd expect, the drama is still amazing and even sad at times. Speaking of action, what you do get is phenomenal. Giant rock men fighting against regular men with armor and spears, destructive water effects, and my jaw was open so many times during the action. But sadly, I felt there wasn't enough. I'd never want it to be a Michael Bay kind of movie, but if I got 15-30 minutes more of action, I'd be very satisfied. Another flaw I noticed was that it can be a little hard to follow at times. A few times I thought to myself \"OK...let me think this over...\". While the story can be harsh at times, I appreciated these parts and they make the movie feel like something different. There's so much more to say, but you should already get the gist that you should see this movie. It's worth every penny."

It is both a block buster and a psychological character study.  It is both Biblical and inventive.  It is both digital and auteur.  It is also, obviously, very thought-provoking\u2026which is more than can be said for most big movies these days.\r What this movie is \u2013 a VERY loose interpretation of the Biblical flood story, with tiny packets of the Book of Enoch and the Qu\u2019ran to flesh out the back story.  As with most Aronofsky films, it is primarily a psychological study.  What exactly does faith mean when it requires a man to let ALL OF HUMANITY DIE?  If that man is sane, how does he react?  Cope?  Adjust to change?  What are the depths of his despair if he feels that his familial compassion equate to failing his God?  These are the questions posed in Noah, and it does a fairly (but not exceedingly) good job working through them.\r What this movie is not \u2013 a Bible study or lesson in Theology.  However, biblical accuracy is not one of my criteria for movie critiques.  It would be akin to stating \u201cDante\u2019s Inferno is HORRIBLE\u2026there is no evidence for nine circles whatsoever in any religious text!\u201d  Obviously, such a criticism would miss the point.  My suggestion is that if you are looking for Biblical consistency you should probably go see Son of God instead.\r There are some slight flaws (e.g. the strength with which Mickey Rourke carries The Wrestler is in a different league than Russel Crowe\u2019s performance; diversions into implied veganism and earth-first philosophy detract from the larger character study, etc.) but the good outweighs the bad.  I choose to believe this movie is a step in the evolution of movies as both big and thought-provoking, and I quite liked it."

I get it.... for some reason the film is polarizing. This movie is NOT the same as the cartoon movie you saw as a kid (yes people that is also one guy's interpretation). However it does have essentially everything that is in the Bible with some artistic flair which is cool with me. Sure they don't say \"God\" but everybody knows \"The Creator\" is \"God\" so whatever... that does kinda bug me but I won't hate on it too much. In any case I enjoyed the movie. It has good action, a pretty faithful telling of the story, interesting take on the pre-flood world, fantastic acting etc. I think you guys need to see the movie for what it is and not make it more than it sets out to be.

I was somewhat bored with the first 15-20 minutes and didn't feel like the story was set up that well, which would have really paid dividends later. But once you get through the odd introduction and get rolling with the film, substance suddenly appears. The fallen angels idea was a fun fantasy insertion and the depiction of Noah at times makes good on the observations found in the book of Genesis and how Noah may not have been what we'd consider a saint but was a foundationally-good and noble man that God could work with to restart mankind after the corruption of Cain. The special effects were pretty solid and the casting was overall well executed. It's not a movie I'd love and I may not watch it again but when the film wrapped up I was at least somewhat happy I watched it. If the second half had been less interesting or fumbled like parts of the first half were, I would have probably come away with an indifferent 5 or 6 rating instead. The building of the ark, which is a significant detail of the original story, is almost glossed over and handed off to supernatural beings (not a spoiler), at least in part. This aspect would have been a huge opportunity to expand upon the trials of the wilderness and Noah's family keeping their ark project a secret but the producers didn't feel the building portion to be all that important to focus on. Worth a watch if you're interested in the story the movie is lifted from but as for historical accuracy/source accuracy, it's probably about 50%-60% accurate and the rest is either creative license and outright Hollywood hogwash."

In a nutshell it is a pro-veganism, pro-ecology,pro-self-hating,pro-social isolation and anti-progress gritty reboot of the known tale of the Bible. The main problem with this movie and its most unforgivable trait is that it tries sadistically hard to enforce those ideals to the viewer, to the point that it makes the viewer actually hate the protagonist and his headstrong self-righteous opinions. The society it shows of Sodom and Gomorrah is clearly a parallel of our society today. The only things that differentiate it is the lack of iphones and presence of rugs. 'We are evil and deserve to be destroyed' he preaches. 'It is a crime against nature to eat an animal' he says and insinuates by showing a man gutting a lamb with his bare hands and eating it raw. This is the work of a raging misanthropist wrapped in a Michael Bay exterior so the masses he hates so much will flock  and pay to watch his delirium.   Despite sharing some of his views,I cannot help but hate this unprecedented ideological enforcement and the movie as a whole as a result.

The problem is, it doesn't really have many merits. This film was simply two hours and fifteen minutes of tedium. The special effects are barely worthy of a SyFy Channel original film. The acting is overly hammy and in some cases mind-numbingly wooden, part of which I feel is the part of the script, which eschews actually writing good dialogue for what seems to be just spewing out statements at random. The editing ranges in style from choppy to lingering overly long on mundane, uninteresting scenes. Everything is just...off. As bad as everything else felt, the score was possibly worse. I've never had issue with the work of Clint Mansell before, but for Noah he's opted for a blaring two note score that just keeps screaming the same two flipping horn blasts in your face over and over again. This is also the first time I would ever describe Aronofsky's directing as \"ham-fisted\". Everything feels overdone, self-indulgent and overproduced.

As someone who experiences a great movie as a spiritual journey in itself I found Noah to be complete crap. I actually thought the first few minutes (before Mr Crowe appears) were an elaborate piss take of the actual movie (in fact I still am not sure the people who rated this movie highly saw the same movie I did).\r The garden of eden scenes were high school project quality. The Watchers, the whacky rock transformer Ent giant things, were rejects from Shrek. The characters are inexplicable and lack depth. His two older sons are just horny at the end of the world. At least the older one gets Emma Watson, even if she is barren (like most of the scenery before the magic seed is planted and a giant forest appears). Ham the middle son is just a sexually frustrated teenager with a tyrant for a father. One of the many non-sensical plot twists is when Ham goes searching for bacon (makin' bacon bacon) in the city and falls into a pit of dead bodies. What does he find? The girl of his (wet) dreams. They climb out as it starts to rain (not end of the world rain just a splattering) and everyone goes crazy stupid berserk. They all start charging for the Ark. Ham's babe gets caught in a bear trap and Noah arrives and forces Ham to leave her there to be trampled by the horde. While all this is going on the older brother is boinking Emma Watson who has been given a womb by Noah's grandfather, nutty berry lusting drugged out medieval hippy,  Anthony Hopkins.\r Noah somehow gets the notion in his head that his mission is to get the animals going again and kill all the humans. Ok, we are all sinners but no where in the movie does it really say where Noah got this idea. This creates Noah the Nutjob, hell bent on killing his new grandchildren. His wife begs him to punish her and not kill the children. What exactly this means and how this would appease Noah's distored mission from god seems only to indicate that Noah's wife has no understanding that her husband consumption of grandpa's hallucinogenic tea concoctions has had a permanent effect.\r This sort of nonsense just keeps coming to the very end of the film. I think Aronofsky, Crowe, and everyon else involved will be forgetting this one is in their reprotoire pretty quick."

Reviews that say otherwise need to reread their Bible.\rThe Creator - using the word \"God\" would be an anachronism. 8(?) generations from Adam and Eve makes sense to still call God \"The Creator.\"\rStone Giants - a bit of Artistic license here - Genesis 6:4 \"The Nephilim were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the sons of God came unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them: the same were the mighty men that were of old, the men of renown.\"\rEnvironmentalist agenda - reread Genesis 9:4-5 and Genesis 2. God tells man that they can eat plants but not meat until after the flood and even then man will have to account for it.\r As a Movie - Great Dynamic characters, Stunning Visuals, Story that means something. Pretty Much everything you can look for in a movie."

      "text": "First off, Aronofsky and the bible shouldn't even be in the same sentence. I'm not even a bible nut, I don't have a religion, but holy **** this movie sucked every one of the male animal's testicles, and thoroughly. The rock creatures weren't even original, it was like a play on the tree guardians from The Two Towers. I did go into this movie knowing full well the probability it would be a complete train wreck, I just didn't know how bad of a train wreck it could be. Another thing, what the hell was a bear trap doing in the forest when Ham and the girl were running back? Anyways, the 1 isn't even for this movie, it's for making a love scene between Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis become a reality."
