Jigsaw would never kill anyone but somehow make his \"victims\" do it themselves. Not so much a horror than it is a thriller or crime drama is this film because there really is nothing to be horrified of, just interested in. You never see anything gory happen at all so \"Torture Porn\" is a completely wrong thing to call the film. The acting was not so great but the actor gave a fairly decent performance. If someone is afraid to see the movie because of the gore they think is in it. Go see this one. It lacks the gore and has a very well written story."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Great Movie! Ignore the reviews that say it sucks because they probably just couldn't handle this film!

But, \"Saw\" however, manaGed to convince me thAt it's different  in a good way.

Ofcourse, in decent moVie fashion, that is explained, and the closer you get to the end, the morE it'll surprise you. It pleasantly suRprised me, and as someone who is terrified by disgusting horror, I must say, this one felt quite unique."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This just goes to show that critics don't know crap.

With the mystery and suspense in almost every scene, we could say Saw took the world by storm and gave us a little something that was different compared to the other films. Tobin Bell is truly a wonderful actor, in fact, he was like my favorite actor in the Saw franchise. With his creepy-looking perspective in the film, we don't really know what he does or where he came from, yet we know one thing- He is a genius when it comes to setting up traps in a particular way, creating them  in a certain fashion. That is what I love about his character! He speaks the truth in pretty much everything, teaches people the value and understanding of life, and he is just inspiring to an audience who wants to appreciate life in a specific way. His voice over Billy the Puppet truly is a masterpiece. Furthermore, I shall say this, Saw is much better of a franchise than the Jaws film production. Each and every Saw film I've seen not only grabbed my attention, but it made me anticipate what is going to happen next!!! Great film! I applaud James Wan and Leigh Whannell for their hard work and dedication to make an interesting horror film! I just love this film."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "If you've never seen a Saw movie, forget everything you've heard about it being just torture porn, that doesn't start until the 3rd movie.

Though the film is essentially a horror film it has nothing to scare you with unless you have a fear of blood and manky bathrooms. The story of saw is simple, 2 men wake in a small dilapidated bathroom chained to the wall with a dead man in between them. One must kill the other before time runs out or both them and their families die. Throughout the film you learn about how the two men are connected more than they thought, about their home lives and about the person who put them in that room to begin with, the Jigsaw killer.\rThe story and considering how well shot the film is are the only thing to save it as the acting is pretty bad at the best of times but considering this was a fairly low budget film I can forgive.

The first saw is a disturbing thriller about two people who are locked in a bathroom and they try to get out. It has mystery and suspense and an ending that thrills the audience. It has some scary moments but saw doesn't want to scare the audience with Boo moments.

Now that I both date a horror film aficionado and my 13-year-old son himself is one as well, I have decided to check out the contemporarily well-received original (I may decide now to see the entire series, and in order, but really who's to say?). Instantly, such trusted, bankable actors as Cary Elwes and Danny Glover give it credibility, just as Bette Davis and Joan Crawford gave such films as 'What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?' way back in days gone by.

It's an interesting inversion of the slasher movie; where Jason or Myers have teens running in terror, pursuing with some deadly weapon, here almost every character is trapped and subjected to some awful game. In fact, the killer is the only one who is really chased in Saw. It's gruesome soul is quite shocking, and its ending is one of the best (if bleakest) in modern horror. It would just be nice if we liked some of the characters before they were subjected to Jigsaw's mindgames (and bodygames), or if Jigsaw didn't preach at us quite so much - two problems the sequels neglected to fix.
