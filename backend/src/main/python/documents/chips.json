Dax Shepard is funny in supporting roles but his directorial efforts (this, \"Hit and Run\" and \"Brothers Justice\") are all awful films. Skip this. There are way better comedies, cop films, buddy flicks..."

      "text": "Comedian Dax Shepard has been acting onscreen for years without making it big. He is perhaps best known as Kristen Bell\u2019s husband and being part of the main cast in drama series \u201eParenthood\u201c which doesn\u2019t actually say a whole lot either. But he is one of those actors who is willing to write, produce and even direct his own stuff if satisfying offers don\u2019t come his way. And \u201eCHIPS\u201c must be one of these pet projects, because he fills all four jobs mentioned above, sharing the screen with co-star Michael Pe\u00f1a. There are actually bunch of other cool faces around in smaller roles, including \u2013 of course \u2013 Kristen Bell. But it\u2019s mostly about Shepard and Pe\u00f1a offering a buddy action comedy, so if you feel like you could like them, it\u2019s half a win for the movie already. (Sadly, there\u2019s smaller number of famous friends on screen than in Shepard\u2019s previous projects, 2010\u2019s \u201eBrother\u2019s Justice\u201c and 2012\u2019s \u201eHit and Run\u201c. I guess Bradley Cooper and Tom Arnold felt that they have done enough for him and let him sink or swim alone now.)Shepard is convincing in the sensitive/wise doofus role that he has chosen to himself, although his acting range seems limited in general. So he has surrounded himself with some rock solid players, starting with Pe\u00f1a who has the coveted ability to make every movie a bit more better just by appearing there. In this regard, he\u2019s like a young-ish Latin version of Morgan Freeman, or something. What is more important here: Pe\u00f1a can effortlessly do action, drama and comedy and there\u2019s need for all three here, Shepard couldn\u2019t hold the fort alone. And speaking of solid, we also have Vincent D\u2019Onofrio who is every inch as imposing and magnetic as we have come to expect from this veteran thespian.Based on the classic TV series of the same name (1977-83), it\u2019s about the adventures of two California Highway Patrol cops. But it\u2019s not the eighties anymore, so we get currently widespread type of raunchy mainstream comedy with some action. If you want to measure the general style of the story and also the nastiness of the dialogue, you should check out the Red Band trailer, for example. It is not able to effectively share the quite enjoyable buddy comedy vibe \u201eCHIPS\u201c has during most of its running time, but you do get an idea if you would like to see some more of it.The result is probably most enjoyable for the little teenage boy in all of us, with plenty of cursing, light violence and sex- or body-related jokes. If you can\u2019t catch their wave, you will probably be a little tired when the end comes. I actually enjoyed most of this raunchy silliness although I felt that the ending felt a bit rushed and half-hearted.It\u2019s easy to imagine that the success of \u201e21 Jump Street\u201c movies made pitching the project and gathering the money for \u201eCHIPS\u201c easier for Shepard & Co. The projects are quite similar: old and loved TV series turned into modern American comedy, two likable guys in the middle of it all, verbally sparring, punching and shooting their way to glory."

      "text": "Much better movie than the ratings suggest. It's definitely a formula buddy-cop movie, lots of action and crude jokes for sure, but I thought it was pretty funny and the cast had a lot of chemistry. Honestly, if this had been completely true to the family-friendly original series, it would've been boring. I think most of the negativity is related to the sex jokes, some being homophobic and some just being pervy-gross, but at the end of the day it's a funny \"bros before hos\" type of buddy movie and this is 2017 not 1977."

      "text": "Actor Dax Shepard can take most of the credit for this wretched remake\u2026he also wrote and directed it. He and Michael Pe\u00f1a play the cop duo who follow a hackneyed scheme about internal corruption. The typically trite mismatched coupling suffers from dumb exchanges, especially lots of sex-related banter (guess he's trying to push the shock factor\u2026another common trait to current R-rated comedies). The plot and characters are often confusing, not sure who's on which side and what's even happening. The only good thing about the whole mess is that the pace is snappy and the running time is only 100 minutes."

      "text": "Dax Shepard tries to do for ChiPS what Phil Lord and Christopher Miller did for 21 Jump Street by turning the late '70s, early '80s TV show into a raunchy R-rated comedy. While a better effort than the Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson led Baywatch, I'm disappointed to say that it didn't succeed. On top of being woefully generic, the movie has a pretty big flaw that stems from Shepard and Pe\u00f1a not having much chemistry. Their individual scenes are fine, but when they are together the laughs aren't as frequent thanks to their banal conversations and irritating bickering. Their eventual acceptance of each other as partners and blossoming friendship feels forced. This makes for a buddy cop flick where you don't want the leads to be buddies.Shepard also tries way too hard to mine laughs from the character's bizarre and decidedly unfunny personality traits. I failed to find anything funny about Poncho's sexual addiction or Baker's tendency to get nauseous in other people's houses. I did get the some laughs from the dialog every now and then or the occasional physical gag. The action and chase scenes are also well done, if a little too heavy on the explosions. It's also the first R-rated comedy I've seen in quite some time that put boobs onscreen as opposed to dicks. Something that will give it some teenager appeal. Ultimately though, it's another example of why people should stop trying to cop Miller and Lord. It not only fails to do the original show justice, but the material isn't strong enough to allow it to stand out as a successful comedy in it's own right.5.8/10"

      "text": "A tale of two motorcycle cops!I haven't seen the 70s series from where this film got inspired by. But before that, I had in my mind that it could be a remake of 'Electra Glide in Blue'. Anyway, it was directed and starred in one of the main roles by Dax Shepard. His direction job is not going anywhere. Though all his so far attempts are appreciable. In this film, it was Michael Pena, who led the rest of the characters. He'd done similar roles in other films like 'End of Watch'. But literally, he ruled it by sidelining everybody else in the film, including Dax.Two motorcycle highway patrol cops team up. They are not an ideal match for the job, but they are assigned in that way by their superior. One of them was an ex-motorcycle stuntman and the other one who had lost his partner recently. They begin to investigate a highway robbery that leads them in the right direction. But can they handle those gangmen who have overpowered them in many ways is what brings twist, before ending with a big action sequence.A stylish cop flick and a quality presentation, but messed up by its screenplay. The story had a purpose, but the film scenes looked not arranged properly in order. There are many unnecessary scenes, just to bring some comedies. Yeah, some of them were really fun, but the film overwhelmed by bad jokes and random action sequences. The actors were good, though it was only the lead two who were the bright spot in the narration. If you forget all the logics, you could enjoy it. It serves a decent entertainment. Yet when it comes to rating, it won't deserve any big number.6/10"

Entertaining and likable leads and a sometimes funny script. Also, a clear love of moto riding and speed in this film, which I appreciate. Hope this guy makes more movies."
