It is the story of William Wallace (and with that also Robert the Bruce) in one of the most interesting and celebrated times in Scottish history. It is a battle for independence from England with schemes and lot of struggles. It is a nice Hollywood version with passion, emotion and glory. It is one of the most immersive movies of its time and deserved its praise by fans and critics. The real story behind it is not as black and white or glorious. It is from a historical standpoint really incorrect and awful (The list of errors would be longer than a summary of the movie). This does however not influence my rating as entertainment and documentation are separate genres. For itself it was Mel Gibson grand project as he was director, writer, producer and main actor. You can always feel the passion, heart and soul that was injected into this project. It uses clever techniques to build up the characters and story. Lets start with the actors. Mel Gibson is a great William Wallace and delivers a remarkable performance. Angus MacFadyen is a strong Robert the Bruce who struggles with his crown. Patrick McGoham as Edward I (Longshanks) is a magnificent bastard and one of the best villains I have seen. I shorten my praise here and say all actors deliver a good to great performance. Then there are the beautiful sets and locations in the movie. They filmed in Scotland and Ireland and it looks awesome. On a sidenote there are holiday trips for Scottish movie locations as many movies made them popular. Then there are the battles. They are intense, immersive and you always feel excited. The story and characters together create a great atmosphere. Also there is some good humor in the movie. While I have no complaints in general I think that the ending can be a bit of a downer. Overall this is an excellent movie that pushes all the right buttons. It rightfully deserves the Oscars and acclaim. It is a must see except for history buffs or historians."

      "text": "Mel Gibson's Braveheart continues to impress. Even though well over two decades have passed but everything from the film's battle scenes to the soundtrack are fresh in my memory. Braveheart builds slowly to its first gritty climax. Much of the early film concentrates on Wallace's love for Murron. Their courtship is unhurried, yet this is all preparation. The real meat of the story, which includes political betrayal, and dramatic battles, is yet to come. Braveheart is a brutal, bloody motion picture, but the violence is not gratuitous. The maiming, decapitations, and other assorted gruesome details make Wallace's world seem real and immediate. It is a testimony to the directorial skills of Mel Gibson that despite being three hours long this film never drags, in fact we the audience are transfixed. Braveheart is one of the best epics ever filmed and people would be talking about this movie fifty years from now.(Gibson's masterpiece)."

Also, the characters are pretty good and Mel Gibson trying to do a Scottish accent is honestly the funniest thing I've seen, it's still an amazing movie though.

      "text": "William Wallace/ Braveheart\r The movie Brave heart is an epic story based on true historical events. In the late 1200 a boy named William Wallace was born. After the English takes his land kills his brother, father, and wife he begins a revolt. This revolution ends up taking on epic proportions. The reason this revolution becomes so powerful is mainly because of William Wallace. He just is a motivational leader and his undying belief in freedom is contagious. In fact before one of the bigger battles of the movie Wallace makes the quote, \u201cSure I\u2019d love to settle down, have a farm, and raise a family. But I can\u2019t do any of that, not without the English taking it. I\u2019m willing to lay down my life for others so that they may live the dream that I have. \u201d It was his belief in freedom and a land of their own that helps him lead his troops so well.\rNot only is the plot amazing, but the actors who preform it are truly stunning. Throughout the movie you can feel it, as Mel Gibson (William Wallace) yearns for a better life.  Every time Wallace loses someone you care about you can feel the pain in your heart too. Also when Wallace was betrayed to the English you felt everything in you die a little bit. This movie and the actors within it really help you respect and treasure the freedom we have now. It was because of great men like William Wallace that anyone has any true freedom.\rThe impact of this movie is incredible. I can guarantee that anyone who sees this movie will have a hard time not screaming freedom randomly. Personally I felt that all the themes of this movie were life changing, and impacted the way I\u2019ll think of day to day life forever. In my opinion the only place this movie fell short was it wasn\u2019t long enough. I would advise anyone who wants to live life to its fullest to watch this movie.\r-Patrick Brooks"

      "text": "The artistic medium of film is very subjective. Every audience member has a different set of criteria they use to measure their viewing experience. Not everyone shares the same set of criteria. If we did, what a bland and uninspired world this would be.\r What I Personally Liked About \"Braveheart\":\rLet's start off by addressing the fact that this film features some of the most spectacular locations ever caught on camera. The shooting locations found in both Scotland and Ireland fit the production perfectly and breathed life into the backdrop in a way most movies can only dream about. The stylish way the locations are presented from a visual standpoint seems highly influenced by the eighties' output of Akira Kurosawa, and let's be honest, there are certainly worse directors you could derive inspiration from. As for the acting, Mel Gibson has fairly decent chemistry with all of the cast members he plays off. This is an admirable trait considering the fact that the spotlight is on him so often in this film. Unlike other three hour ensemble pieces from the nineties (\"Short Cuts,\" \"Magnolia,\" etc.), \"Braveheart\" contains a straightforward narrative and much of that is fueled by Gibson alone. In addition, the battle sequences are well-framed and well-choreographed which creates an exciting sense of urgent realism. It also contains one of the finest, most memorable battle cries of its decade when William Wallace says \"They may take our lives, but they'll never take...our freedom!\"\r What I Personally Disliked About \"Braveheart\":\rFor as good an actor as Gibson is, this film would have benefitted from tighter direction. You can feel every ounce of weight in its length and that is not a complimentary statement. Often times, it moves at a snail's pace with patches that serve to bore the story into one's head instead of letting the moments unfold naturally. Basically, it is an epic for the sake of being an epic. Another drawback is that many of the movie's villains feel like generic knock-offs when compared to the fully fleshed heroes who oppose them. From a cinematic standpoint, as we have learned over the decades, a hero is only as strong and as righteous as his villain is evil and crafty. The forgettable villains in this film inadvertently weaken the accomplishments of our brave Scots.\r My Overall Impression of \"Braveheart\":\rWhile it is a bit long in the tooth and a bit one-sided in the characterization department, this is still a reasonable example of what Mel Gibson was capable of delivering when he wasn't portraying crazed cops or reimagined mavericks. This is his show all the way and you can tell he tried to make the best of it."

      "text": "From its soulful score by James Horner, brilliant editing in the battle sequences, brisk pacing, and dazzling cinematography by John Toll, Braveheart is an epic in every sense of the word.The acting, the surprisingly brutal battle scenes, the speeches and monologues, etc, feels fresh and new to the genre even if they actually aren't. That's in large part due to Mel Gibson's remarkable and risk-taking direction, and the masterful editing.Long shots, wide camera angles, and quick cuts in the dialogue scenes as well as the battle sequences gave this movie a lively atmosphere, and therefore made it a unique experience that helped it to stand out from the other historical epic movies.That being said, I found the tonal shifts completely outputting. The movie kept moving from a somber to a lighter tone throughout its runtime to match the current situations and events. That made some important moments have less impact on me, such as; some dramatic moments didn't work as mush as it should, the climax of the plot felt sudden and not well prepared for it, etc. While it didn't take me a long time to adapt to the new tone, the episodic nature of the movie is quite annoying and distracting.The romantic relationship between Wallace and his wife was pretty fine and acceptable at first, but then it overstayed its welcome a little bit. Whilst the reason for that is quite understandable, I couldn't help but cringe for a while.The villain is very menacing and almost everything about him is great, except that he provided us with an exposition of his plans many times. But, fortunately, likewise some cheesy lines, these scenes were justified by Gibson's excellent direction that gave them an epic sense, and therefore made them more passable.Randall Wallace's screenplay is more than enough to make the movie match its ambition. From the way we witness our protagonist from his childhood to become the hero he is, to the miraculous narrative control on the abundance of side characters and their sub-plots. All that made Braveheart a larger-than-life historical tale, and I don't care about how historically accurate it is because it's a great movie!(8/10)"
