This movie is a stereotypical romantic comedy through and through. However, many ofthe film\u2019s critics believe that it is distasteful and inappropriate. One of the film\u2019s critics, TessCagle of The Daily Dot condemns the film due to \u201cits troubling treatment of the female body\u201d. Inone scene Elle is smacked on the butt and is punished just as much as her harasser. This movie isregressive in the fashion in which they treat situations such as this. When Elle gets the unwantedslap on the butt, she is told that she was \u201casking for it\u201d by wearing a skirt. For this section of thefilm, I agree with Cagle, and I was disappointed that the film would joke about sexualharassment. However, it did bring to light many real life situations that occur in high school.While it can be seen as disappointing, it should be taken as a learning experience. Parents thatwatch this movie will learn of the troubling situations that happen in high school. They shoulduse it to teach their sons to respect women and to teach their daughters to not stand for unfairtreatment from the school. Additionally, it shows members of society that sexual harassment isstill a prevalent issue in high schools. Parents should see this film to understand situations thattheir children may face. This movie deserves credit for bringing to light this issue instead ofignoring.Cagle also claims that the movie\u2019s \u201cunrealistic representation of high school hinders itsability to accomplish anything meaningful\u201d and I disagree with this statement. Therepresentation of high school is very accurate. When this film first came out, I was still in highschool and I found that many of the scenes that took place in the film were relatable. I foundmyself laughing along to many of the awkward scenes that truly happen in high school, whetherthat be walking into the wrong locker room or awkward confrontations. As a result, highschoolers and those looking for the nostalgia from high school would highly enjoy this movie.Additionally, it showed me that I was not alone in some of the things that I had to go throughsuch as being ignored by a best friend. This movie is reassuring to watch as a high schooler as itproves that everything will work out in the end. This film also sends a meaningful message thatgives people another reason to watch.This film set the theme of making your own choices despite peer pressure. Elle ispressured and controlled by pretty much everyone in the film, from Lee\u2019s rule of not dating hisbrother to her classmates shaming her for dating Noah. I believe that these older critics do notunderstand how much peer pressure can influence a high school student. Elle ultimately makesthe decisions to date Noah because it makes her happy. Elle being able to break away from peerpressure is an important message. She goes against the desires of her best friend and otheropinionated peers and chooses to do what makes her happy. The message that is sent across isthat personal decisions should be made for your happiness despite the thoughts others isimportant for high schoolers to hear. As a result, this movie provides insight to high schoolersthat feel overwhelmed with pressure.The Kissing Booth is a great movie and is more than just a romantic comedy with a happyending. The film allows parents to see the reality of high school. It gives parents a window intothe reality of what high school is like and will allow them to understand their children more.Additionally, it gives students some insight as to how to respond when they are faced with somuch peer pressure. Cagle believes that, \u201cteen flicks usually make adults cringe\u2014and this one isespecially unwatchable\u201d. However, the intended audience is high school students, so it makessense for adults to cringe when watching this film. From the outside, they do not understand theculture and reality of high school. Therefore, this movie is more understood and enjoyable to theyounger population. I know I learned how to deal with peer pressure better as a result of the film.The Kissing Booth is a must-watch for high schoolers looking to gain self-confidence in theirown decisions. This movie sends an important message to high schoolers: in spite of peerpressure and the desire to fit in, making your own decisions, will lead to self happiness."}], "recommendations": ["freedom_writers", "booksmart", "moxie", "tall_girl", "the_miseducation_of_cameron_post", "the_perks_of_being_a_wallflower", "wonder", "boyhood", "college", "fist_fight", "sky_high", "captain_fantastic", "young_adult", "instant_family", "bad_moms", "superbad", "you_again", "the_duff", "the_lobster", "never_back_down", "the_spectacular_now", "project_x", "courageous", "mean_girls", "3_idiots"]}
