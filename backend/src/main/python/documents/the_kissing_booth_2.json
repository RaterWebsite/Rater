But, The second part will give you a emotional rollercoaster ride (be ready to take the ride while watching the movie :) ). It's way better in all perspectives. You'll definitely love the movie. Expecting for third part soon!"

Elle\u2019s rollercoaster ride that is her senior year is even more action packed and emotional than her first adventure. A highly enjoyable feel good movie with plenty of surprise twists and turns.. Up to the very last second! I would highly recommend to any rom com connoisseurs."

From the get go it's clear that the little development allowed was more than obvious considering that it's a sequel, however all the characters are so poorly written that their story is as shalliwd as might be expected.Only Joey King shows pedigree in terms of performance. The rest of the young cast leaves no impression and more than anything that's because none makes this feel fluid or normal. Overacting is the order of the day.If the key audience is still within the age range of the characters, they will obviously find it more appealing. But if you have passed that time and your tastes are looking for something more meaty, well, needless to say, you won't find it here.And can someone explain to me why the hell is it so long? That only made it more tedious.The editor should have known better where to cut.Another success for Netflix in terms of streaming numbers but cinema doesn't gain anything with this poor quality."

      "text": "TL;DR - Heard about the first part of this film, was absolutely confounded to see a sequel to this. The characters are fun but they are just dragged all the way to the trash bin with horrendously stupid story writing and gag inducing dialogue writing.This movie was dumb even from a teenager in high-school/freshman year standpoint. Honestly I was not sure what to expect from the writers one who is a 48 year old man, I expected more interesting stuff over early 90's sitcom writing just stretched out over 2 hours. The only difference from a 90's sitcom and this movie is the sexual innuendos and male and female teen hormones splashed on the screen, arguably sexual tensions and sexual innuendos are better done in 90's sitcoms.Please consult young people or at least people who are good at writing to write stories about teenagers, I mean where are movies like Mean Girls or 10 Things I hate about you. God Damn 50 year old idiots writing trash and seeing it gobbled up by the current youth is inexplicable, a third movie already in works. Thankfully my curiosity for this now to be trilogy is dead and rotting at the end of the second part."
