As adults, their sons have developed a friendship as strong as that which binds their mothers. One summer, all four are confronted by simmering emotions that have been mounting between them, and each find unexpected happiness in relationships that cross the bounds of convention.",

      "text": "Some years back Michael Caine and Joseph Bologna got together with their teenage daughters on the beaches of Rio and threw their ambitions to the wind.  Nothing much to remember from Blame it on Rio other than it was Demi Moore's first major role.  It seems even Demi has enough sense now to shy away from a script like this, but not Robin Wright and Naomi Watts who make one for the moms, lusting over each other's hunky sons, and ultimately finding themselves in the same predicament as Michael and Joseph 30 years before.\r Unlike its predecessor, the creators of Adore chose to take their subject seriously, kind of like another ill-fated Demi Moore movie, Indecent Proposal.  What might have been campy fun turns into painful drama as the two mothers simply can't let go of each other's sons even when they become grandmothers, which was apparently the original idea of this story by Doris Lessing.  However, Robin and Naomi just come across as GMILFs.\r I wouldn't have even bothered with this movie had it not turned up on late night television.  What is worrisome is that these are two actresses at the peak of their careers.  Wright had just started House of Cards and Watts has the luxury to throw away roles given her copious filmography.  There isn't much you can draw out of roles like these, at least from a dramatic point of view, but they struggled valiantly to do so. Fortunately, they both moved on quickly, putting this nonsense behind them."

A produ\u00e7\u00e3o, de forma geral, \u00e9 boa. A fotografia \u00e9 bem feita e as cores, principalmente nos momentos onde a praia \u00e9 o centro das aten\u00e7\u00f5es, \u00e9 inteiramente agrad\u00e1vel. Por\u00e9m, acredito que os elogios parem por aqui. na verdade, o roteiro/trama \u00e9 t\u00e3o mal feita que eu fiquei com raiva.Primeiro: o desenvolvimento dos personagens \u00e9 NULO. N\u00e3o sabemos quase nada sobre eles e o romance entre o \"primeiro casal\" \u00e9 t\u00e3o superficial que isso \u00e9 chega a ser um desrespeito a inteligencia do p\u00fablico. Sabemos que eles se conhecem desde sempre - afinal, ela \u00e9 a melhor amiga da m\u00e3e desde crian\u00e7a -, e o \u00fanico esfor\u00e7o que o filme faz pra desenvolver algo entre eles \u00e9 mostrar uma cena dos mesmos no mar, onde tudo que o personagem do Xavier Samuel sabe fazer \u00e9 cara de flerte. A progress\u00e3o t\u00e1 longe de ser org\u00e2nica e tudo piora depois dali.Depois da ideia mais criativa dos roteiristas serem a vingan\u00e7a n\u00edvel quinta serie [Tu \"comeu\" minha m\u00e3e, agora vou \"comer\" a sua tamb\u00e9m hur dur], temos a conversa entre as duas amigas, na qual se resume a \"cruzamos a linha\". Logo depois, o moleque demonstra nunca ter feito sexo na vida ao dizer a tia que a ama - meu deus, parece fanfic. A surpresa dela ao saber que o muleque que tinha ficado com ela por vingan\u00e7a tinha a tra\u00eddo, a mesma dizendo que nunca foi t\u00e3o feliz - a veia s\u00f3 transou -, o pai adivinhando que o filho tava \"namorando\" s\u00f3 de olhar pra ele. Sem contar no show de interpreta\u00e7\u00f5es p\u00e9ssimas no ato final. Velho, \u00e9 tanta cisa pra falar que posso ficar escrevendo aqui a noite toda.Por fim, fica muito claro que o filme n\u00e3o tem NADA A DIZER, e a \"obra\" faz quest\u00e3o de jogar isso na nossa cara ap\u00f3s um final il\u00f3gico, incongruente e for\u00e7ado. O filme tem o objetivo de agradar um publico algo, e visto a bilheteria, talvez tenha conseguido, mas nada oclui o fato de ser o fracasso que foi."

      "text": "The first thing the movie \u201cAdore\u201d makes you want to do is book a flight to Seals Rock, New South Wales, Australia, to see the blue drenched waters, green mountains and hills, sun baked beaches and homes to die for, a Paradise on earth and the film does a good job of advertising the place and the surroundings.\r Lil (Naomi Watts) and Roz (Robin Wright) have been best friends from childhood and still are after each has been married, with Lil now a  widow and Roz\u2019s husband, Harold (Ben Mendelsohn) taking a job in Sidney expecting the family to join him. Lil has a son Ian (Xavier Samuel) and Roz a son, Tom (James Frecheville) both at the end of their teens ready to take their place in the world. In the sensual surroundings they live in, it is not long before each mother is having an affair with the other\u2019s son.\r Based on a short story by Doris Lessing, and a screenplay written by Christopher Hampton, the latter doesn\u2019t know quite how to get into the story and the director, Anne Fontaine, seems afraid to tell a 2013 story, instead making it a film that Todd Haynes would have told in the 1990s or Douglas Sirk in the 1950s, both who would have gone deeper into the ramifications. While there is no darkness in the film neither is there a light touch that could have made it more meaningful. We have come a long way from \u201cThe Graduate\u201d and Mrs. Robinson but \u201cAdore\u201d is stuck in that era.\r The supporting players, such as Mendelson, a potential suitor her own age for Lil, Gary Sweet, and girlfriends for both boys played by Jessica Tovey, and Sophie Lowe, work hard but the writer and director don\u2019t seem to take the circumstances seriously and the shock value is almost nil. It is stuck between the possibility of farce and how lives would be affected by the adults decisions.\r Watts, Wright, Samuel and Frecheville offer a lot of eye candy for both sexes and do the best they can with the material they are given.\r The film moves too slowly at points and should have been cut by 10-15 minutes but the work of the cinematographer Christophe Beaucarne is worth the price of admission. The city of Seal Rocks should give him surfing rights for his lifetime."

      "text": "I have to say that I adored adore. It is a guilty pleasure that I'm sure would have made a good tv mini-series as it doesn't exhaust its own possibilities within the movie. Based on a short story by writer Doris Lessing it is easy to see why cynical highbrow critics would dismiss it as soap, and indeed many have panned it. I am at a loss to know why as it is intelligently adapted and written by Christopher Hampton and Anne Fontaine, who is also the film's director. In fact the writing is generally superb presenting some improbable situations in a natural and believable fashion. Some unintentional humour does creep in from time to time, but overall I was compelled to follow the story's arc. The performances are superb with Robin Wright the standout. Looking more and more like Jessica Lange, she is particularly moving. In scene after scene, many of which are filmed in extreme close up, every nuance of emotion is there to behold on her face. She is stunning here and I am tempted to say that it is the best I have ever seen this under rated actress. With its attractive cast and beautiful locations the film also looks great."

It makes you think about the different personalities of people Of how some are so much more emotionally involved and others are in much more control. The purpose of life is to love and be loved.   This movie is indeed a guilty pleasure in more ways than one."
