She was all in for committing a crime that would have sent a man to jail for life.  Shocking."

It reminded me a lot of the director's much better film, \"Primal Fear,\" but it never came close to reaching that film's genius. I think that Anthony Hopkins needs to stop playing roles that are so similar to Hannibal Lecter before that's the only type of part he is offered. Or maybe it already is. It seems as though he tried to make his character more interesting (did anyone else notice the very subtle accent?) but what the character needed was to be WRITTEN more interesting. I never understood just exactly what his character did for a living. We were given a basic idea, but I think more of an exploration into his mind would've allowed for a better film. His ball bearing devices that litter his office and home suggest a much more interesting man. Gosling is great, and this was the first film I've seen him in. This is merely a stepping stone for him to better films. I wish I could say I saw all the twists coming, but I didn't. I've never been good at predicting what's going to happen before it happens unless it's blatantly obvious. But it doesn't matter, because when the answers were revealed, they were completely uninteresting. Boring film. Don't waste your time on it."

That said, being guilty of murder didn't make sense if he couldn't be charged with attempted murder. His wife died because the hospital turned off her respirator, which they were presumably entitled to do under the law, with his permission. How can that be murder if under the double jeopardy concept, he couldn't be charged again with shooting his wife? Doesn't compute.

Fracture doesn't fulfill that criteria. The legal proceedings are riddled with creative liberties, making the entire thing a fiasco. The ending turns out to be laughably stupid, and the bad guy is predictably caught doing something insanely dumb...except what he's doing wouldn't actually be a retrial for a separate crime as it is in the film, since he didn't murder his wife, they pulled the plug on her in the hospital. His attempted murder charge still stands, but murder does not, and that's sort of a ridiculous way to catch him at the end. Also, since when do criminal masterminds openly brag to others about getting away with attempted murder all by themselves? Did it not occur to this guy that someone else might possibly be listening in somewhere? You're only talking to the goddamned prosecutor that will do anything to take you down, and you're openly admitting as loud as possible that you shot your wife and then got away with it? The \"twist\" as to why there's no evidence is also just stupid. It's circumstantial evidence and would never hold up in court, as it's nothing more than a theory by the prosecution that can't possibly be proven. All the bad guy has to do is deny it, and that's the end of it, since there's no evidence linking the events together, which was sort of the whole goddamned point of his plan. That's not evidence. If the bad guy had just said, \"Get out\" once he saw this prosecutor enter the premises, he would have gotten away with everything. Instead, he takes the opportunity to laugh and gloat about his perfect murder. And then, look at that, no one saw this coming: People are listening outside. Oops! Must've forgotten to read about how many criminals get caught by bragging about it in local bars. None of the characters besides Hopkins are the slightest bit interesting, so any time he's not on screen, we're just waiting for him to turn the tables on the prosecutor again, due to the prosecution's seemingly impossible stupidity. The rest of the plot seemed like it was just filler. With an ending and a twist this bad, not to mention one that doesn't make any sense, with a legal rule that's badly misinterpreted and totally bogus to finally catch the bad guy, the film just has no excuse."

On top of it, the plot was absolutely gripping and really had you guessing as to how it would end (however it does become clear towards the end). However, the film is never really great. At many turns, it is quite good, but really, it is just a solid entry in both Hopkins and Gosling's filmographies. The film certainly is not Oscar worthy, but it is still very entertaining largely thanks to its two leads who really are at the root of why this film is successful.

      "text": "In 'Fracture,' shameless conviction.\r A movie about shamelessness should be shameless itself. And for five minutes here and there, \u2018\u2018Fracture\u2019\u2019 does a passable job. In fact, Anthony Hopkins, who plays a genius structural engineer who shoots his wife and then represents himself at the trial, has rarely demonstrated less shame than he does in this preposterous courtroom thriller. Nor has Ryan Gosling. Although at about a third of Hopkins\u2019s age, he has decades to top his oily performance as opposing counsel.\r The film is neither a whodunit nor a whydunit. We know both. Hopkins\u2019s character, Ted Crawford, pulls the trigger because his wife (Embeth Davidtz) has been having an affair. Not long after the shooting, a detective (Billy Burke) arrives at the Crawfords\u2019 great big Southern California home, and to his shock discovers that the woman on the floor is the very one he\u2019d been seeing. Ted goes to jail, willingly confesses, and relishes the fact that Gosling\u2019s district attorney, Willy Beachum (what a name), will try to put him away.\r Willy is the movie\u2019s favorite kind of lawyer: hotshot. This one is about to move on to bigger things \u2014 a fancy new job at a corporate firm, where he can work alongside the icy dame (Rosamund Pike) who recruited and bedded him. But his 97 percent conviction rate and Ted\u2019s obvious gamesmanship (that the wife\u2019s lover took Ted\u2019s confession nullifies Willy\u2019s entire case) compel him to find a new angle to prosecute. Ted chooses to be his own defense attorney, claiming he knows nothing about the law. But he\u2019s obviously better at it than Willy. Fiona Shaw plays the presiding judge, and she looks rightly confused and exasperated.\r The movie seems so content to be smarter than you\u2019re expecting that it never amounts to more than a talky tease. What\u2019s breezy about the first half of the picture turns logy in the second. The entire film is hung on a shrugging legal plot twist that, years ago, managed to inspire a whole Ashley Judd vehicle. And since Hopkins is far too likable as a would-be cold-blooded murderer (whose wife, mind you, remains in a coma) the movie has to settle for a humane ending that also feels like a shrug.\r \u2018\u2018Fracture\u2019\u2019 was written by Daniel Pyne and Glenn Gers and directed by Gregory Hoblit, whose last legal thriller, \u2018\u2018Primal Fear,\u2019\u2019 was more enjoyably hokey. The new movie isn\u2019t stupid, however. The screenplay has its share of fun, snappy dialogue, and there\u2019s no shortage of good actors to deliver it, from Shaw and Pike, to David Strathairn, as Willy\u2019s boss, Cliff Curtis, as a detective, and Bob Gunton, as Pike\u2019s father.\r Then there\u2019s Gosling and Sir Anthony slinging ham at each other. They spend their scenes crossing accents. Gosling\u2019s has a backwoods lilt that evokes possums, beer cozies, and spritzes of cheap cologne. Hopkins might be using his native Welsh brogue. Who can say, since to me he doesn\u2019t ever sound the same way twice?\r In any case, you needn\u2019t actually see \u2018\u2018Fracture\u2019\u2019 to know that if the charge is acting that winks, these two are guilty."

      "text": "never less than a \"check\"..Fracture Fracture is a plot driven courtroom drama among a lawyer at its prime prosecuting an already confessed guilty who now is defending his case with no whatsoever experience. It is surprisingly hilarious with much more mature humor installed in with suave note that it never seems forced and cheeky. The narration is fast paced with tightly packed screenplay that is gripping if not layered and thoroughly entertaining for its runtime. Amidst all these highly pitched dramatic sequences it fails to draw out the emotions especially concerning the relations and chemistry since the frustration and the irritation described and portrayed for the protagonist communicates clearly. The background score is exhilarating if not scored extraordinarily and along with decent cinematography and fine editing, the boat floats safely on technical aspects. Gosling is vulnerable but still resists it on each frame against the master Hopkins whose reputation is justified in here with a cunning script and slick chess moves that were never less than a \"check\". The script aces on enfolding newer territories and bold turns and choices that it makes which is not only to bedazzle the viewers but also justifies it considering each perspective. Hoblit's execution might be decent and palpable to its tone but what stands out in here, is the world created by him that feeds itself on nothing but nature and that is something which doesn't come often. The only thing that itches throughout the course is the procedure through which the makers either rush up or skips few beats. The gripping screenplay, the enthralling high stakes through which it conveys its subject and Gosling's stellar performances are the high points of the feature. Fracture not only breaks but shatters expectations that results into never wearing off euphoric energy for the viewers, actors and makers."

      "text": "Good, but still could improve.In this \"court movie\" we have the simple situation of a vain lawyer, accustomed to winning cases, who is faced with the difficult task of proving that a powerful businessman killed his wife. Cold and thoughtful, he manages to anticipate every step of the prosecution lawyer and is determined to seize every asset to confuse and shuffle him. To make matters even more complicated, the prosecution lawyer is in the process of being hired to work in a large and important business law firm, and hiring largely depends on his performance in this case.I have little to say about the script ... the story seems to me well built and developed, and the twists that happen are, in fact, what keeps people stuck in the film. However, it is not very credible, it could be even better and there are some loose ends that can bother you. Plus, it's a bit predictable. Ryan Gosling is convincing in his character. Together with veteran Anthony Hopkins, who gave life to the villain, dominates the film, and how the two characters interact and provoke help greatly to maintain the interest of the public. We really want to know which of the two will come out on top. The remaining cast is limited to the space that the two protagonists leave free. I would particularly highlight the good contribution of Fiona Shaw. Rosamund Pike, meanwhile, despite being like a fish in the water on yet another ice cold character, seems to be left in the film. Technically, the film has quality as well. Good camera game, nice color and light, a regular soundtrack but it does what it needs to do.Overall, this movie does what it claims to do, but it can not do enough to exceed what it is regular and become truly good."

You end up cheering for the bad guy to get away in this movie because the lawyer he's up against in a total A-Hole who only cares about himself. Also, the romantic aspect of this film where the hot shot lawyer is having a sexual relationship with his boss, which makes you hate him even more, serves no purpose to the entire storyline. The ended that was suppose to put a \"Oooh!\" on your face really ended up being a \"Whatever...\" The twist at the end was so ridiculous and obvious half way through the movie, that I lost all interest in the storyline. I originally put this movie at a 3, but as I write more bad things about it, I realized this movie really deserves a 2!"

The legal errors were so glaring that I was unable to enjoy the movie. Just because a defendant waives a preliminary hearing doesn't mean that the trial is going to start the next day. When a defendant files a motion the prosecution has an opportunity to respond, in writing. Judges don't make rulings in chambers, etc. My guess that a police investigator who saw this movie would have their own complaints about police procedure. That being said, Hopkins is still an interesting actor."

Not a big problem for me with this script though, as it was nice to see the \"most likely scenario\" play out without some campy set of extraordinary circumstances being revealed at the last second. Hopkins has the \"genius without a conscience\" character down pat, and perhaps I've just seen it one too many times, so I wasn't overly taken with that performance. However Gosling did pleasantly surprise me, and I found myself vacillating between hoping his character would succeed and wishing for him to fail. He underplayed the requisite moralistic struggle and epiphany scenes just enough to make them part of the movie flow, rather than an all too predicatable sub climax."

      "text": "Many critics and moviegoers have noted the many apparent similarities in characterization and performance between Anthony Hopkins's Ted Crawford, who plots the perfect crime against his unfaithful wife, and Hannibal Lecter. One fundamental difference stands out, however: while nobody would mistake Hannibal \"The Cannibal\" for anything other than evil incarnate, his attraction to FBI agent Clarice Starling (at least in the original Silence of the Lambs) provided a humanizing factor, however brief...but Crawford is nothing more than a thoroughly despicable sociopath with no redeeming qualities beyond a veneer of surface charm which he operates to suit his purposes. The latter can be the only reason why a seemingly intelligent woman like Jennifer (Junebug's Embeth Davidtz) got involved with him in the first place; given that Hopkins looks healthy and fit enough here to outlive us all, she certainly couldn't have been \"pulling an Anna Nicole\"! District Attorney Willy Beachum is easily fooled; he's a rising legal star who through a combination of youthful arrogance and the distraction of a prestigious legal position he's about to step into, unwisely assumes that Crawford's on-the-spot confession after shooting Jennifer constitutes an open and shut case. Yeah, and back in 1975, Brody, Quint and Hooper were just going on a little weekend fishing trip. Competing for your box office dollars with such derivative slashfests as Vacancy and Disturbia, and with Spidey, Shrek and Sparrow just around the corner, Fracture emerges as an intelligent, satisfyingly twist-filled pleasure: the movie equivalent of a guilt-free beach read. One characteristic that Hopkins's work DOES share with Silence is that in both he's such a powerful presence that you think he's onscreen for much more of both films' running time than he actually is. The focal character in Fracture is really Willy, who's the one character whose future (not just what career track he will or won't eventually take but what kind of human being he'll choose to become) is really at stake. Ryan Gosling proves in this role that his surprise Oscar nomination last year as a likable but substance-abusing teacher in the sleeper Half Nelson wasn't just a space-filler; he continually makes offbeat, unpredictable character choices that are a real joy to watch--notice precisely just how he gets out of his lover's bed! Davidtz is such an achingly lovely screen presence that director Gregory Hoblit's use of innumerable close-ups of her (even after she's in a coma) indicates his outrage that industrialist Crawford, by not only attempting to murder her but by shooting her in the face, is committing the ultimate act of natural destruction by defacing such an example of pure beauty, even if Jennifer were doing the horizontal polka with the entire local police force! Ultimately, Fracture's central flaw, especially evidenced in the far-too-restrained absolute final scene before the closing credits roll, is that Hoblit (Primal Fear) isn't quite outraged ENOUGH; in endeavoring to make a courtroom movie in which the prosecutor is the hero that will still appeal to liberals and ACLU supporters in the audience, he's just a little too polite, genteel and distanced. I recently rewatched an old DVD box set consisting of four 1980s Charles Bronson action movies, all directed by J. Lee Thompson (The Guns of Navarone) in the final stages of his long career for those notorious schlockmeisters Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus. The flicks are raw, lurid and occasionally offensive, but at their best (especially Ten to Midnight and Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects, arguably the cream of the box) they really tap into the anger that their audiences undoubtedly feel about murderers and lowlifes who successfully manipulate the American legal system in order not only to get away scot-free with their crimes but to keep committing more of them. As enjoyable as Fracture is, Hoblit clearly needs to be a little less classy and cerebral and a little more down-and-dirty and emotional in his storytelling; silly as this may sound, the man needs to inject a small but vital dose of Golan, Globus and J. Lee Thompson into his soul!"
