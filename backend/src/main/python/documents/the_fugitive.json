Tommy Lee Jones was great but really, who cares as he had to act his way through a TV show."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "The Fugitive, at first glance, would appear to have a lot in common with the summer blockbuster trash you see every year. The Fugitive is far from a standard thriller though. Unlike the majority of films offering cheap thrills (which this film does still have in droves), The Fugitive actually has a brain. The dialogue is pretty slick, and you actually feel emotionally invested in the characters. Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones both turn in among the finest performances of either their careers, and play out an exciting on-screen battle of wits and resilience. This extravagant game of cat-and-mouse is handled well, and while you sometimes have to suspend your disbelief at some points of the story, and gloss over a few plot holes at others, the film is always entertaining. The only real crime the Fugitive commits is that fails to hide where the final, supposedly shocking twist is going to come from - you see it a mile off, and this slightly undermines the rest of the story. Despite this disappointment, The Fugitive is well worth a watch - it's clever enough to be considered more than just \"another thriller\", and you'll have a very enjoyable time watching it throughout."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Most people use The Fugitive as an example of how a perfect chase film should be but in all honesty I've seen better (District 9 for example). However that is not to say that The Fugitive isn't a quality film from start to finish. It does what its supposed to do and is incredibly entertaining while it is doing it. The downside of the fugitive is it seems to be made of scenes that the director didn't quite know where to put with scenes talking about Richard Kimble's (Harrison Ford) intelligence being slotted in quite late in the film because it slowed down the pace so the viewer could take a breath. This kind of mix match of scenes doesn't prove too much of a problem but if you want to emphasise your characters intelligence, you might want to do it at the beginning instead of waiting until he has been on the run for 70 minutes of a 2 hour film. That being said, I enjoyed the mystery novel pace, the glacial reveals of key nuggets of information as the reason behind Kimble's framing come together nicely for one hell of a finale. When it comes to The Fugitive most people will talk about the scene on the dam or Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal of Samuel Gerard but the best part of the film in my opinion is the beginning, the moments before he starts running. Not only does it set up Kimble's character so that there is not a moment you think he killed his wife but it also gives you reason to like him while also showing he isn't perfect. He is quick to anger but incredibly kind, he is the Everyman kind of hero the film needed and Ford portrays him as such but also brings subtle quirks to the character. The film commences the chase with some great effects and from that moment on the film continues to build in tension until the very end with there being stand out sequences (such as the one on St Patricks Day) leading to a cracking final act.Despite the fact he was the sole Oscar winner for the film, it should be said that he deserved it with his character being something else, a great performance that still impresses today. Overall a excellent thriller but it could have used a more coherent idea of what the film should look like in the end with scenes feeling out of place or unnecessary  for no good reason."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Is it just me......Or are all American thrillers basically the same movie, just slightly altered and repackaged each time? Okay, I know at heart that there are some obvious details in each film that make it different to ones before it, but I can't be the only one who's thought that, by simply pulling a bunch of dangerous-sounding buzz words out of the air (words like 'prosecution', 'corruption', 'mistaken identity' and 'manhunt') I could form the foundation of the next big action thriller. So why, then, is Andrew Davis' The Fugitive, a film that contains all these base ingredients and more, so much fun to watch? Short answer: a solid story, good acting and a cast of characters that fit into their respective roles like a favourite pair of pyjamas. Long answer: by all means, read on.Harrison Ford is Dr. Richard Kimble, a respected man sentenced to prison for murdering his wife, despite being adamant that it was not him, but a mysterious one-armed man, who committed the crime. On the bus ride to the big house, the other prisoners stage a daring escape, allowing Kimble to flee and begin a life of anonymity whilst seeking out the real killer. That is, until he crosses paths with Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones), a hard-nosed US Marshal who cares not for Kimble's excuses, and whose only concern is restoring the status quo.Excluding the excellent Indiana Jones trilogy (notice I've left out the fourth instalment, which I refuse to mention by name), Ford has made this genre his forte, making him a natural fit for the desperate, determined Kimble. Jones earns the Best Supporting Actor Oscar by playing the typical Jones role to great effect: a no-nonsense tough guy with a sideswiping sense of humour. And Joe Pantoliano, best known as Ralph Cifaretto (or Cypher, if you're no Sopranos fan) makes under-appreciated contributions as Gerard's right-hand man.Suspense is on high supply throughout. My personal favourite is Kimble's attempt to hide in plain sight at the hospital, a tense and dramatic set piece that sets a paranoid tone for the rest of the film. But there is a plethora of energetic, 'edge-of-your-seat' moments to satisfy film connoisseurs and action junkies alike, including the sewer chase, the St. Patrick's Day parade and the rooftop climax, all of which comply with the conventions of an action thriller nicely against the backdrop of a bleak, but not quite noir, Chicago CBD.Speaking of conventions, it's clear that Davis has made a tight pace the top priority in The Fugitive, as the entire film is determined to remove any and all obstacles that would otherwise slow the movie down. Character development is restricted mainly to Ford's character, but is sprinkled in just enough to keep the rest of the cast from looking like cardboard cut-outs. But most pleasing was the omission of a romantic subplot. At different times during production, both Julianne Moore and Jane Lynch were scripted as Kimble's love interest. Despite the obvious pitfalls this would create from a logical perspective (considering Kimble spends the whole movie trying to avenge his beloved wife), it also sounds like the director has dodged a minefield of clich\u00c3\u00a9s by avoiding the beaten path; something I am very grateful for.Admittedly, the film becomes a little convoluted in the third act. Depending on how much you've enjoyed The Fugitive, this alone might be enough to warrant a second viewing, but otherwise it's nothing that a quick trip to the IMDb won't fix. If you're looking for a theme to take away, I suppose the movie could act as an exposition of human nature in desperate times. However, I doubt that was on the agenda during filming, and so the film should instead be enjoyed as was intended: an absorbing, high-drama roller-coaster, which I expect will remain a staple of this genre for many decades to come.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

Directed in 1993 by Andrew Davis The Fugitive stars Harrison Ford, Tommy Lee Jones and Julianne Moore.... Doctor Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) is found guilty of his wife's murder but during transportation something happens and the prisoners on board escape including Doctor Richard Kimble who is now an escaped fugitive and Tommy Lee Jones plays a U.S Marshall who must hunt him down.

Full of great action scenes, chases, violence and possible bad language The Fugitive delivers and remains one of the greatest films ever made thankfully to great acting performances by Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones. Only bad thing about The Fugitive is how small and insignificant Julianne Moore's role was but besides that it's perfect in all departments from the directing all the way down to the story and acting and anybody who writes a review of The Fugitive saying Harrison Ford's acting was horrible obviously must be on drugs because his acting in The Fugitive was top draw. I've seen films with Harrison Ford that are bad and believe me, The Fugitive isn't one of them! I've seen many great films from Harrison Ford such as Witness, Frantic, Clear and Present Danger, The Devil's Own, Blade Runner, etc and The Fugitive is another of his great films.

Based on a 1960 TV show it is the story of Dr. Richard Kimble who is framed for the murder of his wife and convicted to the death sentence. While being transferred to the prison an accident happens and he could escape. He wants to proof his innocence and find the real murder. Because a murder is on the run a specialist in form of US marshal Samuel Gerard and his team are assigned to capture him as soon as possible. This is the set up for the movie. The story is amazing. Dr. Kimble tries to find the truth while being hunted by Samuel Gerard. It is a cat and mouse game while also being a murder mystery. It is a timeless story of an innocent that wants to find the true culprit while everything is against him. Everyone can relate to this. Also who does not like a (murder) mystery or investigator who asks the right questions / finds inconveniences. I stop here before it gets too much into spoiler territory. Lets say the movie is enjoyable from start to finish. A big part of this are the lead roles. Harrison Ford as Dr. Richard Kimble is amazing. He nails his character and emotional struggles. Tommy Lee Jones as marshal Samuel Gerard might even be better. He was truly good and reprises this role later on in another movie. Those 2 enhance the movie. I should also praise the whole cast and team as I see no misstep and found each character believable if not even truly good. All did a great job and I include of cause director Andrew Davis and writers David Twohy and Jeb Stuart. The score by James Newton Howard is also great. It is a bit sneakingly as I noticed only at rewatching how fitting and enhancing it was. Overall this is another easy recommendation and classic.

Casting was perfect, the music is very strong, all performances flawless.  A real narrative thread, every shot is relevant. At 2 hours there is no fat on this movie, but advancing character development in perfect balance with plot.  Every character faces a moral dilemma of whether to protect Kimble or not, some protect him out of self interest, some out of morality, those that report or pursue him do so out of duty balanced with moral interest.  In modern Machiavellian times, I cannot imagine characters with such luxurious morals being viewed as anything but idiots.  I think the difference is that people in the movie feel confident they won't be prosecuted for helping Kimble, that they live in a society which would not persecute them for their morals.  That is a wonderful fiction I would love to live in.  The roots of corruption are present, in a corrupt pharmaceutical industry, but an overall moral society, how wonderful.  I recently read about the guy who inspired the Fugitive: his name is Sam Sheppard and his story was nuts, mom committed suicide same week dad died of cancer, same week he was sentenced, he did 15 years, volunteered to be injected with cancer in jail, got out, they gave his medical license back he killed two women in surgery, became a pro wrestler married a nazi drank himself to death, all by age 45 !!!!!
