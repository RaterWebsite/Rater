It's rare where you see a movie where everyone has a problem and the movie captures the essence of these problems that may never be resolved. But as in life, we can try and that's what the movie portrays. I personally would have liked my emotions to have been tugged or jarred a bit more. I wanted to believe but just quite couldn't."

Every time I started to enjoy it, I thought again \"he has a half-naked girl chained to his radiator.\" Somehow, that one part of the movie destroyed it for me. Some great scenes, some great acting, and enjoyable integration of music. Overall just a little too hard for me to participate in the \"suspension of disbelief\" for this film."

      "text": "\"Black Snake Moan\" uses the blues as its primary motif, then completely wastes it; because in the disastrous third act, what ensues plays like an atonement for Rae's wicked ways(or a creative compromise for the sake of financing and the almighty green light). We want \"Black Snake Moan\" to be more like a R.L. Burnside song, but instead the tune changes and it's more like Lisa Germano's \"You Make me Want to Wear Dresses\". If this film had the conviction to portray a loose and sexually carnivorous woman without any apologies, maybe the third act could've been used to comic effect. However, this carefully calibrated film, built like \"Pygmallion\", was leading us up to this transformation; because unfortunately, \"Black Snake Moan\" is a prick tease. Ricci really ignites the screen as a honest-to-goodness nymphomaniac, but then the audience is saddled with the story of How She Got That Way. It's kind of a drag. God wins in \"Black Snake Moan\"(this film is no place for a preacher), but we lose(c'mon Justin, pop a cap in that...)."

Surprise endings are great, but it wasn't a surprise it was hatred...It's so unbelievably bluesy! But c'mon we all go to see it for Justin anyway. And goodness, Samuel's hit his ups and downs, but he did an alright act with co-star Ricci. It's a bit, hmm...sexual! Kinda wasteful, but I wouldn't say to miss it."

Jackson on the blues guitar, singing AND playing himself, a suggestion of older man younger girl love affair, and Justin Timberlake really acting and this is a powerful film that deserves our sympathy. The surprise of a Justin Timberlake actually acting quite well, yes, it's a gimmick. But even after realizing that it IS a gimmick, it's still one that works. While the story is not that surprising, it's still good enough. All in all, a 9."

Sam Jackson again channels the TIME TO KILL simple folk nature, but there is the tongue in cheek SNAKES ON A PLANE dialogue creeping into it all. This man needs one of those statuettes, on principle alone. Who else shifts as many gears? Consistency. Ricci is fearless and I'd never think I'd be giving Justin Timberlake props, but he did his thing. Yes, the premise speaks to taboo and typecasting, but we know that is the intent. The resolution is in no way contrived. This flick meant and moved me more than BABEL's mute chick or latino nanny did wandering around the border desert or neo-trance clubs. And any one with a memory could call THE DEPARTED, a vanilla NEW JACK CITY. My only qualm was the run time. Could have trimmed off about ten minutes. Craig Brewer is on a roll. Pimps, hoes, rap, and blues. What could be next? The way he creates such a sweaty, sensual atmosphere on camera, I would really like to see a Swamp Thing or Daniel Craig Live and Let Die remake? Gleeful x-ploration of x-ploitation."

It is intriguing and wonderfully acted with the best soundtrack of any movie in a long time. I wonder if people who have had little exposure to the deep south can fully enjoy the movie or empathaize with its characters. Unfortunately, the characters are not has far-fetched as some critics make them sound, and the blues that unites them is as real as it comes."

I mean I think Brewer might make good movies in the long run but the only reason this movie was watchable was once again because the cast was on point, just like Hustle and Flow. It seems like in the hands of a better director used to quirky stories and more skilled at bringing forth emotional imagery, BSM could have been a winner. Anyway I didn't feel like I wasted my time, but a curiosity rental would probably serve you best. If you are not curious then please avoid."

That said, the development of the father-daughter style relationship between Rae and Lazarus is sweetly done, and their joint journey out of their personal hells is intriguing, if not particularly probable. Worth seeing if you enjoy watching Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci; but overall a silly movie."

I loved how some of the scenes in the movie ended as though you were watching a play. The film was as hot and sticky as a hot summer day in the south. Both characters fighting their own personal demons manage to find a small piece of stable ground to stand on in each other. Samuel L. not only manages to give another great acting performance but provides some great music as well. I think those who don't appreciate this movie are just used to the same old thing being put out over and over again and cannot see past the choices we have been forced to choose from here lately. See the movie. I doubt it will disappoint."

      "text": "Samuel L. Jackson is legendary and he has the unique ability to turn even a strange movie like this, into something that is worth watching. Black Snake Moan is a really ridiculous story, full of odd symbolism that just really doesn't make any sense. Jackson plays Lazarus, a loner who lives on a farm in the middle of nowhere. He's a deeply religious man, whose wife just left him for his brother. Lazarus responded to this by locking himself away and putting all he has into his farm. One morning he finds a badly beaten girl, with a reputation, laying in the road and decides to help her, but he soon comes to believe that this girl is possessed and that God sent her too him for help. Not knowing what to do, Lazarus takes this sex crazed, drug addict and chains her to the wall of his house. Throughout this film, there are all kinds of symbols that don't make any sense. There are scenes featuring an old blues singer talking nonsense, scenes of the town that we almost never see, and perhaps strangest of all, there are moles added to Jackson's face, something you don't see except it cases of a biography. As for the performances, they were terrific, This is the best performance I've ever seen Christina Ricci give and she really gave Jackson a run for his money. Jackson, was also great, giving what you expect to see from him, albeit with less swearing than usual. The performances were really the only thing this film did have going for it as the events that take place just don't make any sense. The film jumps around, leaving things unfinished, and personalities seem to change as often as the wind blows. It's a pet peeve of mine, but I really hate when great performances are wasted on a film that is so poorly written, that it's almost unwatchable. Black Snake Moan is sloppy, jumps around without finishing things, and at times just doesn't make sense. It was an interesting idea with a terrific cast, but the people behind it were clearly in way over their head and just didn't really seem to know where they were going or even what they were doing."

Enter black farmer and ex-blues singer (Sam. L. Jackson) who decides the only way to \u2018save\u2019 her is to chain her to his fireplace (literally!) Brewer then introduces a bunch of Southern Baptist types to shift the focus (slightly).  Now our movie maker attempts to please both the porn lovers and those who want to play it \u2018straight\u2019 \u2013 this mix sits uncomfortably together and one hardly justifies the other.  The players work harder than the script deserves and the results shift off in all kinds of perverse directions to an almost tacked on finale.  If you don\u2019t object to spending a couple of Hrs looking at a series of grungy situations with foul mouthed despots \u2013 you might feel at home \u2013 otherwise, you may want to give this rather ugly exploitation flick a wide burst."
