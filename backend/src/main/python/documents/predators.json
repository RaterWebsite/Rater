It was gritty, edgy and a well-produced B-Movie that resembled the feel of an 1980's film, most particularly, the original 1987 Predator.  Predators supports a very similar premise to its predecessor and it shares its feel and look. It also boasts good performances and some very bloody action.  I loved it.  A 8.25/10"}, {"rating": "6", "text": "i had higher hopes for this film but it was ok . i am a big predator fan so it helps my enjoyment of the film . it tries to take the original film and kick it up a notch and does so in some ways but fails in others. it seems like every lead charicter gets compared to arnold who fought the predator in the original film . well theres only one arnold and will probubly never be another who could fit in thoose shoes as a predator kicking bad ass. adrian brody does a fair job as the merc who is kinda shady and mysterous . what he lacks for in the giant build he has in brains . there is alot of action that is enjoyable to see and the plot all be it bare bones and copying alot of its original film keeps your attention for the 90 min its running . the beefs i had with this film are the lie it told in the previews . i know what really got my attention was the part it shows brody's charicter with a predator lazor beam locked on him then you see a dozen more light up 1 after the other . well in the actaul film iots only one lazor beam . which pissed me off . the trailors try to make it seem like they are fighting a dozen predators when actaully iys just 3. false advertising like that pisses me off. deduct 3 points just for that alone . also lawarnce fishburn's charictor just didnt seem believable as a guy who survived as long as he did . it just seemed like they scewed up with that charicter and coulda made him this bad ass but instead made him a loon . all in all its a decent film im not sure id recomend any one go out to the theater and see it . its more along the lines of a rental. it is better then AVP 1 and 2 though"}, {"rating": "6", "text": "This was the true sequel to the 1987 original.

He didn't survive 9 seasons by being an idiot! Brody somehow arranges to get an alien spaceship to take off and fly completely unmanned!!!! At the end, Brody and Braga are surrounded by a parachuting 'Season2\" castmates and we see them casual and non-affected and with no desire to 'get the hell out fast'. We also got to see two predators fight each other with our a clue of who's who... and don't get me started on Topher Grace initiating his serial killer routine before the bad guys are all killed off while he would have been left with nothing but a hypodermic needle and a jackknife available to defend himself.

They were live-action video games. \"Predators\" fairs only slightly better. Appropriately enough, the film opens with a man hurtling to the ground(the screenwriter must've had a Sprite) as the achromatic atmosphere, symbolic of the white light from a computer, is the preamble to the game: the planet where Royce(Adrien Brody) must play \"The Most Dangerous [Video] Game\" with his multi-cultural survivalists. (The predators are like CBS executives.) To lend \"Predators\" some much-needed gravitas, Adrien Brody quotes Ernest Hemingway, and acts like a Hemingway character(perhaps Wilson in \"The Short Happy Life of Francis MacComber\"), as Brody's Royce deduces that they're being hunted on a game preserve after he and his colleagues are attacked by spiky-looking quadrupeds. In order to escape from the \"Lost\" planet, the spirit of Schwartzenegger finds itself abounded in the \"classic\" predator, who like the android in James Cameron's \"Terminator 2: Judgement Day\", protects his former prey from an updated model: in this case, a higher evolved predator(the \"black\" predator) who keeps his ancestor in shackles. So Royce makes an alliance: Royce has guts, or as Hemingway put it, his course of action exemplifies \"grace under pressure\", when he perceives that the \"classic\" predator(who as it turns out, was probably only following orders in the South American jungle) isn't his real enemy, and frees the predator so he can fight his oppressor. Not only is Royce a man of action(he comes back for GRACE), but a man of great intellectual powers, as well: a man who reads. \"Predators\" can be read as a liberal film."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "The original film was no masterpiece, but it led an example of style and suspense.

Liaison Major George Dillon were dropped into the deep jungle with orders to rescue a presidential cabinet minister kidnapped by guerrilla forces in Val Verde. As the progress through the jungle Major Schaeffer and his team stumble upon a downed American helicopter and the skinned remains of several bodies later revealed an American Special Forces team afterwards, they make there way to a heavily guarded rebel encampment quickly dispensing of the troops in the base and taking a young girl hostage. Major Schaeffer soon finds out that the entire rescue mission was nothing but a hoax cooked up by his superiors to get his team to kill the guerrillas in the encampment, after Dillon confesses that the men they found earlier disappeared in a failed rescue mission of two CIA agents. As they make there back to the extraction point the commandos, an unknown creature using thermal imaging is watching them. After two members of the team are mysteriously slain, the survivors become aware that something in the jungle is stalking them, something not of this world.   Year: 2010??? Location: unknown  A lone mercenary named Royce wakes up in free fall over a dense jungle after deploying his parachute and maker a rough landing on the planet he assumes is Earth possibly the Amazon. Royce meets up one by one with a colorful group of killers much like himself: Isabelle: An Israeli Defense Force black ops sniper, Cuchillo a Mexican Los Zetas drug cartel enforcer, Mombassa  a Sierra Leone RUF death squad officer, Nikolai a Russian Spetsnaz commando, Stans  a notorious and deadly death-row inmate from San Quentin state prison. Edwin a seemingly innocent doctor (who does not seem to fit in with the rest) and Hanzo a Yakuza assassin they have been brought together for one reason and one reason only on our planet they are the greatest killers we have to offer. Something has brought them to a jungle planet to hunt them for sport but the real question is what brought them there? How do they get home?   Robert Rodriguez and Nimrod Antal's  \"Predators\" is  not a continuation of the horrendous AVP franchise directed by the abysmal Paul W.S. Anderson there film goes all the way back to the  look and feel of John McTiernan's 1987 cult classic  that became one of the 80's  deifying action/adventure films and also a deifying film in Science fiction horror. I know that is hard to believe but when you look back at \"Predator\"  and look at the official sequel \"Predators\" you can see what made the character and the film so popular. All throughout this movie, you feel a complete and utter sense of nostalgia as you watch the characters march around the jungle and out run, there-impeding doom; this is a well-made movie with a fine group of actors that know what they have gotten themselves into They enjoy every minute of it. It does not appear that way onscreen seeing as they have to be serious you know they must have had a ball shooting it out with the predators I know I would. Antal and Rodriguez avoid what made the AVP movies so bad and focus more on what made the Predator franchise so good  they take there main queues from Predator the quiet subtle nature and a little from Predator 2 mainly the gritty pulpy feel  of the trashy sequel  put them together and what do you get? \"Predators\u00e2"}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Predators is a waste of time without interesting characters and without no story.

Now, they try to extend the narrative into a new chapter from thiz franchise, in PREDATORS, with letter S which is expected to be multiplying (I guess). But what I see from thiz newest alternative is just a movie with a repetitive formula and setting. The formula is still a typical mysterious introduction to the creatures what we called Predators and how a group of soldiers die one by one, until the last one. The setting is still tropical jungle, exactly what we saw on Schwarzenegger version. Thiz one is officially the third Predator movies since the first one in 1987 and PREDATOR 2 in 1990, plus two spin-off when Predators clash with the Aliens (another iconic Hollywood creatures) in AVP (2004) and AVP 2: REQUIEM (2007). Unfortunately, I almost can say thiz one could easily fall into B-Class movie with B-Class Actors attached, such as: Alice Braga, Topher Grace, and others. The only exception (of course) is on Adrien Brody performance, his attempt to be action hero must put as a great credit itself. Brody seems to be successful to build his body and delivers some brawny hero attitude, with his voice and tone characteristic. The other brief but convincing appearance made by Laurence Fishburne. I simply watched thiz movie bcoz I wanted to see what could Nimrod Antal (Director) did for his next project, since his latest VACANCY (2008) created an intriguing and effective thriller. In thiz Predator movie, Antal did not make a new innovation. In fact, he took many rip-off elements from the first original one. If they are keep doing thiz without any modernity has been made, I think they might had been killing Predators itself.\r Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Actually a pretty good Predator movie, especially compared to the ones that came after it.Yeah, it has plot holes, like the Fishbourne character acting without any logic (but I guess maybe hes gone crazy), and the ending could have been better, but overall the movie is very entertaining, at least a few characters are likable and you actually feel sad when they die (rare in modern woke movies) and the setting brings you back to the best movie of them all."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "I liked the short story 'The Most Dangerous Game' approach.

The plot was excellent, and i was amazed how they associated the endeavors of Arnold Achwarzenegger during the first film, Predator. The cast of characters seemed to fit in, except for the deceptively innocent doctor. My one major problem with the movie is that i expected to discover some information about the origin of the predator species. along with that, the ending seemed somewhat anti-climactic, but the epic fight between one predator and the yakuza member, along with the old versus new predator fight, saved the ending. The fact that we discovered why the doctor was thrown into the fray also made for a good ending. My other problem, which is a minor one, was the soundtrack. It was excellent, but at points it seemed to somewhat take away from the suspenseful effects of the atmosphere.

Thankfully. There really wasn't anything that I hated about it. Some of it was predictable, but not many movies aren't predictable anymore.

Very wrong. Predators focuses more on the inhabitants of the alien planet instead of the soldiers.

Overall, the cast and the acting was very strong throughout the film. The special effects and costumes were very convincing, especially the dogs in the beginning. When Nikolai was dragging one of the deceased hounds for observation, it looked as if it were a real animal. I would strongly recommend this movie.
