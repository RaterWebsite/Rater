After over 30 years past the latest installment of Mad Max series, George Miller returns with his greatest ideas in his mind, resulting in raising the bar in all terms for the genre - colorful characters, satisfactory plot, delightful setting, enigmatic character and story backgrounds, multiple references to other movies of the series, and enough of personal and overall human drama. It's only May, but we already have our movie of the year."

I wasn't able to sit back at all during the movie, the constant action and twists had me either on the edge of my seat or jumping up and down with my brother screaming. The only thing I feel could have been improved upon was diving more into the past of Max himself, he is one of the most iconic characters ever for many Action movie fans and yet, in a movie made to continue his Glory, he was explained very little. Those who know of his past of course understood some of the finer points in the film. All in all, I truly enjoyed my experience and I will definitely be buying it upon release. 9 out of 10."

Honestly I was a bit worried when I first sat in the cinema to watch this movie because I was unsure if the movie will live up to my expectation based on what I'd seen on the trailer or not. This is because most of the movies I watched previously only appears really interesting in the trailer but not in real premiere. However, this one totally blew me off. It is super duper cool and worth it! I haven't watched previous Mad Max series and when I heard that since this is going to be a sequel to past Mad Max series, I thought I wouldn't understand the plot but it turns out there's not much to understand anyway. The plot is straightforward although there are some parts which leaves me into question but I guess I might need to refer that to past series. Anyway to be honest the plot is just normal to me but I do give top marks for the action of this movie. I mean this is literally a full action movie. Right from the beginning to the end there's always action scenes which leaves the audience in awe and I think with this kind of movie, the plot don't mind that much to me. This movie is like the apocalypse version of Fast and Furious and for gamers who have played apocalyptic games, this reminds me a lot about games such as Rage or Twisted Metal. I would love to see another sequel to this!"

It managed to keep all the ridiculousness of the old Mad Max movies and still managed to be fun but not feel out of place or incredibly stupid while doing so. Charlize Theron did a great job, which I'm glad to see after the last few stinkers she's been in. It's pretty much nothing but action for 2.5 hours straight, but it worked in its own way.\r If you're going to see an action movie this summer, I'd say choose either this or Age of Ultron, but this was definitely the superior movie."

      "text": "\"Mad Max: Fury Road\" 10 Scale Rating: 9.0 (Fantastic) ...\r The Good: Quite possibly one of the greatest action films of the last 20 years, if not of all time. The film retains the gritty tone of the original films, but with updated effects and choreography that is mind-blowing. \"Pulse-pounding\" and \"edge of your seat action\" are terms that get thrown around a lot in reviews of films like this one, but they are completely appropriate here. Almost the entirety of the movie is spent on one \"war rig\", but there is a certain level of twisted beauty in the simplicity of it all. The vehicles are fascinating beasts of twisted metal and gasoline. The characters are hopeless, yet determined. The world itself is barren, hot, and unforgiving. This all sets the tone perfectly as you watch the protagonists struggle through it all in a series of brilliantly designed chases, brutal battles, and bloody deaths. Hardy was well cast as the titular Mad Max, grunting and fighting while uttering few words. Nicholas Hoult is unrecognizable as Nux, one of Immortan Joe's (the main villain of the film) \"War Boys\". When he's on-screen, he definitely stands out and Hoult is becoming quite the character actor. The real star of the film, however, was Charlize Theron. If anyone ever wondered if she could pull off an action film, wonder no longer. She not only pulls it off, but excels. Entertaining from start to finish, Mad Max: Fury Road is already in the running for best film of 2015.\r The Bad: Not that it matters TOO much, but the plot is not only paper thin, but mostly non-existent. It's a small detail, but prevents the film from being absolutely perfect. Aside from that, some of \"the Wives\", who are a plot device that helps drive the film, were somewhat annoying and uninteresting."

If you have enjoyed any of the previous Mad Max movies, this is well worth seeing. If you like action movies, this is well worth seeing.\r Was it perfect, no, but it was really good. They struck a nice balance between realism and fantasy physics. The story did not get to complex or retread the previous movies story lines. It fit the Mad Max universe.\r I am willing to say Fury Road is the best of the Mad Max series. Loved Road Warrior, but Fury Road got to take advantage of a higher budget and more modern effects.\r The only thing that kind of annoyed me was the children memory thing. They over did that at times.\r Did I miss Mel Gibson, nope. Tom Hardy is a great replacement for Mad Mel."

      "text": "Oh, man. I don't have words for this film yet. Maybe there are no words, since what George Miller and his team put onscreen defies description and transcends language. But here's my attempt.\r With technical precision that seems effortless but must surely have taken a small army to manage, Miller weaves his unique, fantastic vision of post-apocalyptic chaos and carnage into a work of piston-pumping poetry, all set to Junkie XL's adrenaline-fueled soundtrack. Without hyperbole, I can say right now that this one of the all-time great action movies. It makes Furious 7 look like a badly edited Mario Kart replay.\r I'm not gonna lie, there was a moment of vehicular mayhem where I shed a manly tear. T'was one of hope, for my heart had almost forgotten what heights pure cinema was capable of. It's got a minimum of CGI, fantastic stunt work, great set design and art direction, breathtaking locations, and strong performances, even from the supporting cast. This is the movie I've been waiting for my whole life, ever since I smashed little Matchbox vehicles against one another as a child and made comics about sentient cars.\r There's no prior franchise experience necessary. If you're a connoisseur of action films, you miiiight want to try being in the best theater you can find this weekend. I just can't wait to see it again and am gonna do so as soon as possible.\r As far as performances, Tom Hardy makes a fine Max, Charlize Theron's Furiosa is up there with Ripley as one of the most badass women in sci-fi, and Nicholas Hoult's Nux is very entertaining. The dude who plays Immortan Joe (he was in the first Mad Max, too) is just perfect, the kind of larger-than-life big boss whom you can imagine inspiring lifelong devotion. Whether or not the story boasts a \"feminist agenda\" in having a number of strong female characters is up to the eye of the beholder, but it didn't bother this cis, straight man. If you want my real opinion, I think the gender-war-fueled backlash is all hyperbole designed to sell more tickets, and anyone offended enough to not want to see THE FIRST MAD MAX FILM IN 30 YEARS probably needs to have their man card snapped in half.\r I really want to congratulate everyone involved in the production of this film. I don't even mind if this ends up being the last great action film, but wouldn't it be grand if this was really just the start of a new breed of action films? I'm really, really hoping that Miller gets a chance to make the sequels that he already has scripts and storyboards for. Tom Hardy is apparently signed on for another three films. I say BRING 'EM ON! Valhalla awaits!!"

It\u2019s an entertaining series, and we\u2019ve got some worthy new lead actors to carry the story forward. Kudos to the production.\rHowever, I\u2019m shooting for the tires of all those \u201c10\u201d ratings out there.\rFirst, the movie is essentially a car (truck) chase, which makes it difficult to give dynamic range to the drama \u2013 it\u2019s always on pretty loud.\rSecond, the performances are good given this context, but hardly stand as masterpieces of character acting.\rThird, let\u2019s keep our powder dry and acknowledge that 8 or 9 is a worthy score for this movie. If you give Fury Road a 10, what does Raging Bull, or The Godfather Part II, or, if you want to stick to sci-fi, Inception or The Terminator, deserve? Or, if you want a bizarre, violent chase out of the Western genre, what does The Good, The Bad and The Ugly get, if this is a 10?\rFourth, the action-heavy and dialogue-light nature of this genre \u2013 and this is a genre film \u2013 leaves you with few memorable lines. Without that, it is harder to have memorable scenes. How do we build a shared shorthand around this \u201cclassic\u201d? Do we use phrases like \u201cthe scene where he got the mask off his face\u201d or \u201cwhen Max gave her the gun because she was the better shot\u201d? It is not impossible, but it is difficult.\rSo, go to this movie and enjoy its entertainment value, but let\u2019s not elevate too many comics to classics."

      "text": "Walking out of this movie, so many superlatives were competing for attention in my brain. The movie is an absolute must-see - let's get that out of the way from the top. For me, it's probably the best, most artistic action film since the original Matrix. Furiosa (Charlize Theron) is clearly the best heroine since Ripley in the Alien films. Going in, I figured the action would be fatiguing, and the desert backdrop would get samey after a while, but I couldn't have been more wrong on both counts. Miller's inventiveness knows know bounds. If I had to point to a slightly weak link in the chain, it would be the Immortan Joe character. No doubt, he's fun to look at and provides some of the comedy, but as a character, he is not nearly as personally threatening as the chief baddies in the original Mad Max and Road Warrior flicks.  But the supreme creativity and the acrobatics in the driving sequences are so over-the-top phenomenal, you'll be conscious of the silly grin on your face when things finally let up and you allow yourself to exhale."

I cant remember a single line that Max says, and to be honest, I don't get the hype for Theron. She never seemed that crazed, threatening, or powerful to me. Who are we really supposed to care for here?\r The movie certainly is not without its good attributes. It is colored and shot beautifully, but is so thin every where else, the stunts and practical effects are wasted.\r I wanted more Max, I wanted a follow up to that great scene at the end of \"Road Warrior\" where its just Max and the \"Road\".  This outing borders on cartoonish, and isn't brutal in any way. Where we are supposed to feel fear, and stress at the mass of pursuit vehicles, all i kept thinking was, \"Where do they get all the headlights?\", or \"for an apocalyptic wasteland, they seem to have no lack of tires or car parts\".

      "text": "The long awaited 4th installment of Mad Max series does not disappoint, George miller and his team put great efforts on the screen to make a pure masterpiece of car chase movie and created a truly crazy world, a fabulous vision of post apocalyptic world that served 2 hours of non-stop action & excitement,\rwe have suffered from the regular action movies through the last few years. but this one finally comes with something that is really fresh & epic.\rVery fine acting, Tom hardy once again proves that he is one of the best actors of his generation and really did a badass & tough Max, Charlize Theron shined with Furiosa and put her soul to appreciate this heroine, remember this little kid from the movie \" about a boy \" who called Nicholas Hoult ! in Fury Road you will see him as you never seen him before when you watch his very insane portrayal of Nux. and that Toecutter who called Hugh Keays-Byrne surely will give you a boner with Immortan Joe because his performance was very terrifying but in a good way.\rThis movie owes a lot to his bloody incredible stunts, if the academy award made a new category for stunts even for once ! this movie should win it.\rthe soundtrack & the visuals are awesome and fit the crazy world of the wasteland.\ra highly recommended for everyone, especially the fans of the original Mad Max trilogy. I guarantee you won't waste your time\rBelieve the hype, this movie is not only the best one of this summer. honestly this the best action movie of the decade and establish his position as one of the best action movies ever made. putting his name alongside huge flicks like Terminator 2 & The Matrix.\rI don't always go a geek, but when I do ! I do it for one like this."

In the end I spent most of the movie making snide comments to my friends and laughing at how implausible and poorly thought out it was, wishing there was a plot. It did become so ridiculous it was fun once in a while, but mostly it was just pointless and weird. I proceeded to check the reviews online when I got home thinking \"this movie is going to get destroyed\" - but no, everyone LOVES it?!! After reading about the \"practical\" stunts etc. - sure I'm impressed, but I still think overall the movie is so stupid that I signed up for a metacritic account just to say so! I could generate a list of 100 ways this is ridiculous (like if bullets and gas were in limited supply, why is everyone shooting guns and flamethrowers into the sky?) I truly felt nothing for these characters and was quite glad when it ended (with the \"good guys\" just dumping all the water into the desert!). There are other reviews here that more accurately capture why this movie makes no sense (look for the red reviews) - I just wanted to express my confusion as to the widespread acclaim for this movie. I guess I just missed the point."

We switch rock music, explosions and car races for symphonic music, monochromatic shots and \"deep\" life messages? That part broke the movie for me.\rThen we continue with more explosions and races, but now with circus performance like stunts? Where that come from and why it is in mad max?\rWhy is there this feminist narrative : evil old diseased white guys destroyed the world and with army of violent fanatic white guys enslaved people. luckily are brought down by few of virtuous women.\rso deep message, so progressive, so original...\rLets not skip plot holes and realism, it was supposed to be action movie.\r But seriously, what the duck?"

      "text": "What a disappointing re-boot of a classic, low budget original.In fact, it disrespects the original. In the original Mad Max, the lead character was actually mad, angry. In this re-boot he isn't even the lead. Furiosa is , and she is the Alpha. Mad max is along for a ride in this uber feminist take on this idea of a post apocalyptic, gas obsessed world. But wait, you say, the idea behind this film is that strong women can stand up to tyranny and create a better world, one that doesn't even contain men. Ok, so why is the Utopian green place dry up, most of the women dead, and their solution is to  turned back to take over Joes' empire? Isn't this ending a slap in the face of feminism, as portrayed in this film? Women couldn't do it on their own so they took what a man created, but they are going to make it a better, gentler place? Don't get me started on the symbolism of the hot wives, in the desert, spraying themselves with the second most important liquid in this fantasy world, water , spilling it all over, drinking it , spitting it out. A symbolism for male seed and the value, or lack their of, that the modern feminist movement places on men? You decide. There are lots of little anti-male nuggets in this film.\r Come on! First, feminism, by its very definition is equal pay for equal work. period. It's NOT about male roles vs female roles ( or stereotypes ). Second, who says women are kinder and gentler in an post apocalyptic world? Lots of examples of women that get drunk on money and power in today's society, why are they held in a better light in Mad Max vs the men? This is all misguided feminism. I guess, since women are better at their core then men, they really don't fart or pop either. Stupid drivel."

But every single thing else sucked.. **** plot, **** acting (for the most part), disgraceful dialogue, some of the worst characters and absolutely zero character development is present..  The fact that the action in this movie is awesome is not even close to bringing it back to redemption. And calling one of the best movies of all time?  I know your biased but dude, dude...... Dude.... You cant be serious, no way can you be serious.. 3/10.. Take away all dialogue and characters and leave only the action and you got a solid 8 but jesus was it bad.."

      "text": "The art of nothing or an ode to skin heads, would've been a more appropriate title rather than Mad Max. I don't think the audience got a good grasp on how Max was Mad. Maybe part 2 will further unravel his character. Aside from the skin heads and the demonic s***, I really enjoyed the 2 hour long action pack car chase movie. I love the cinematography and the too hot sex slaves, in addition to the Salvador Dali surrealism feel to it. But as a minority, I didn't know rather to be offended or entertained."

      "text": "In spite of the spectacular and mesmerizing stunts and effects, in spite of an amazing Charlize Theron, my enjoyment was inhibited by other more internal feelings. First, it\u2019s a dystopian world, squalor, misery, disease and oppression, I get it. However, these (and I use the word loosely) people, were so grotesque, so monstrous, so gruesome, so aberrant, they presented a world that I could not even root for the protagonists to survive in. It was such a world of dread and vulgar mutants my depression overwhelmed my ability to separate it out and simply enjoy the visuals.  Speaking of visuals, there were stunts like we\u2019ve never seen before.  However, to achieve this never seen before quality, the stunts were totally preposterous. Every law of physics, gravity, logic, cause and effect, were breathtakingly violated. In this world seemingly comprised of only rabid dogs shaped into human form, who the hell refined the infinite amount of gasoline they used? Who were the mechanics and auto body experts that built and maintained all of the crap they used??? What did the multitude of thousands of depraved  thirst starved inhabitants do when they were not all gathered at the rock tower of water dispensation?  Farmers? Factory workers? Business owners? This world assaulted my logic to the degree that it pulled me out of the mindset the storyteller wanted me to lose myself in. Overall? Simply depressing."

      "text": "I can't remember the last time I was so disappointed in a move. I expected to love this movie - I love the originals specifically (first two more than the third, obviously) and sci-fi and post apocalyptic movies generally. I don't demand more than the skimpiest of plots in them as long as I care about whether the people live or die as we go on their journey with them. And in this movie I really didn't care.\r In the original movies, I cared about Max and understood his pain. In 1, I knew why he was in the situation he was in and I knew why he did what he did, even while I wanted him to be better. In 2, I cared about the other people in the settlement and I wanted them to understand that Max was a good guy deep down and wanted them to accept him. I cared about Max's dog and what happened to him more than I cared about any human character at all in this new movie.\r Yes, the movie looked incredible, but all it did was take a bunch of undeniably incredible set pieces and then flap about looking for a plot to string them together. This was like a two hour trailer for a movie I felt I WOULD like to watch, because in the actual movie there would have been something to make me care one jot for the people in it. And I just didn't."
