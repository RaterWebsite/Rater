      "text": "After the disappointment of the forgettable Disney classic The Black Cauldron Disney has some interesting ideas for the next feature film Basil The Great Mouse Detective aka The Great Mouse Detective. It's about the Sherlock Holmes story where Basil and Dawson had to find Olivia's father from the evil villain voiced by the famous Vincent Price. The chase scenes are a lot of fun just like from the other Disney classics. There's even some scary scenes of a bat in it much like in The Black Cauldron, it is one of the darkest feature films ever. The animation and characters are great, my favorite character is Basil and and the animation is good as well but for the clock tower, the animators are computer animation to make it look like you're inside the big ben. If anyone's a huge Vincent Price fan, I guess this is a Disney classic for you."

      "text": "This movie just passes as your average animated action movie, doesn't pass on its own merits. It's not nearly as good as I remember it from my childhood. The primary problem is that this is supposed to be a Sherlock Holmes style mystery but it is not presented as a mystery. Rather it's presented as an action/adventure movie. There's no suspense or mystery to it because we know all along what happened to Olivia's father, who did it, why they did it, and what they want. It's shown to us very early on. There's no riddle to solve here and everything that comes out of Basil's mouth sounds like a bunch of clairvoyant woowoo nonsense because they stretch the limits of what can conceivably be derived from observation and deduction, breaking the suspension of disbelief. It could be an educational movie that teaches kids how to solve mysteries, riddles, or use deduction, but it doesn't do any of that. And before you go saying \"but it IS a kid's movie, aren't you being too harsh?\" No. Zootopia is a kid's movie. Harry Potter movies are kid's movies, and they have at least basic mysteries that can be explored and discovered by the viewers as the protagonists understand and learn more, not from an omniscient view where there's no riddle to solve because we already see what's happening on the villain's side. What are the positives of this film? Maybe some nostalgia fodder. Fun characters for the furries and those who like talking animal movies. Maybe one or two jokes that give a giggle. It's a bit overlong for what it is, and I love talking animal movies in general, so... Eh. Even the Rescuers movies are a better mystery than this, and this one's modeled after THE great mystery hero Sherlock Holmes. Doesn't do the genre justice.Most of the points I even give this review are for Ratigan's theme song. That's a rare moment of joy in an otherwise tepid movie. He's an underrated Disney villain and you can tell some of his animations were recycled from the ending fight sequences into the ending fight sequences of Beauty and the Beast. The scene glows when Ratigan is on, but I think it's a problem to have a villain who is much more interesting than the protagonist. Basil comes off as easy to give up, nagging, and can't be bothered. Ratigan by contrast has a sort of deranged charisma and humorous silliness."

      "text": "The Great Mouse Detective es una de las pel\u00edculas animadas que mas nostalgia le tengo. Gr\u00e1ficamente se ve incre\u00edble para la \u00e9poca, los personajes son muy memorables y la historia es divertida dentro de todo, aunque si es cierto que a veces algunas cosas no son tan agradables (en el sentido de que puede ser un poquitito cliche o que lo que te est\u00e9n contando no sea tan interesante a veces) y Basil como personaje no lo sent\u00ed tan bien hecho, ya que puede llegar a ser muy redundante y alargar bastante la trama con pistas forzadisimas que se las saca como si nada, chistes fuera de lugar o las t\u00edpicas conversaciones gen\u00e9ricas vistas en muchas otras pel\u00edculas animadas. Al final de cuentas, el no aporta mucho a la investigaci\u00f3n, haciendo el rid\u00edculo y es mas que nada Dawson el que hace todo el trabajo por el (obviamente quitando alguna que otra excepci\u00f3n). Basil como protagonista para mi no funciona del todo, y cuando en una historia los personajes secundarios tienen much\u00edsimo mas inter\u00e9s que un personaje principal (incluso mejor dise\u00f1o en lo personal), hay algo que va mal. Dawson, Fidget, Rattigan, Miss Kitty, Hiram y Olivia, Toby, Felicia, etc... son todos mas carism\u00e1ticos que Basil en mi opini\u00f3n (\u00a1y eso que hablamos tambi\u00e9n de personajes terciarios!)... Honestamente le estuve por dar un 7 a esta pel\u00edcula. Sin embargo, debido a que gr\u00e1ficamente es espectacular, ademas de cumplir en cuanto a historia como pel\u00edcula animada para la \u00e9poca, junto con el carisma memorable de los personajes (excepto Basil) y el dise\u00f1o de los mismos que me encanta (especialmente el del murci\u00e9lago Fidget), se lo voy a subir a un 8. Muy recomendada."
