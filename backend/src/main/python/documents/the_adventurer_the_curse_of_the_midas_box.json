Set in the 19 th century, it takes a happy academic family and tears it apart. Following the disappearance of their mother and father, Mariah Mundi ( Aneurin Barnard) and his younger brother Felix (Xavier Atkins) are chased by two villains, who make a great criminal double act, leading to Felix also being captured. Mariah is then aided by a family friend, Will Charity (Michael Sheen) to track down his brother whilst also looking for an antique weapon of mass destruction, the Midas Box. The path leads to the Prince Regents Hotel run by the enigmatic Otto Luger (Sam Neill) where the solution to the mystery lies. This film might not go onto win awards, but is is entertaining, and certainly worth watching. Great performances from all cast including the smaller roles, Mellor Caron as Mariah's companion, Sacha, is a worthy assistant, and Xavier Atkins gives a great performance as the annoying younger brother who goes through some serious danger as his world collapses. Aneurin Barnard gives a measured performance. Michael Sheen certainly helps to give life to all scenes in which he appears and Sam Neill is excellent as the master criminal. I would recommend seeing this film."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "I can't understand those three reviews with 9, 9 and 8!\rThis movie is utter garbage, a shame, bad as anything, worse than a toothache.
