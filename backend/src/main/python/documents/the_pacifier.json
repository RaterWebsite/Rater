      "rating": "6",
      "text": "It was a decent movie. It has moments, touching moments, it gives u chuckles and even a few laughs. It isnt trying to win awards or stun the audience with special effects. You sit down, watch it, laugh a little, think about how cute the kids are, then go on with rest of your day. Alot of action stars have taken a turn at comedy to soften their image, Stallone and Arnold S. to name a matinee viewing. The kids are charmers, Vin Diesel doesnt seem to mind being the but of jokes, and most of the acting is good. And ladies, he spends most of the movie in tight t-shirts. Guys u have to settle for Lauren Graham's sweet smile."

      "text": "Great family movie, but not one that I enjoyed otherwise. I do like Vin Diesel but I kept wondering what he was thinking when he read this script and agreed to do this movie. If you can get over the childish jokes and bland acting you realize that there are worse option than The Pacifier, but their are far better options as well."

I still don't like this movie but i like that they play Good Charlotte \"The Anthem\" in the song. That is the only pro. But i hated this movie originally because the girl scouts got back at the boy scouts. But now i just dont like it because of the humor. Vin Diesel is a great actor though, he was in XXX."

      "text": "5 hours after sitting through this entire film I am still asking myself what compelled me to actually watch it. Vin Diesel stars in this not so funny comedy about a Navy SEAL assigned to protect a family. From a plot that could have the smallest bit of potential to be an all around entertaining film to watch with the family was anything but entertaining or funny for that matter. Many scenes that were intended to make audiences laugh by director Adam Shankman did anything but that. Despite this film being nothing but cheesy and dull I was proud to see Vin Diesel break his typecast 'tough guy' role that he plays in almost every film he has done. Although he does play a Navy SEAL in the movie, Diesel has moments where he drops the tough guy act and transforms into a loving father figure for the children he is watching over. By the end he actually decides to quit everything he has worked for in his life as a Navy SEAL and decides to become a teacher at the school the kids attend which would have been cute if the movie wasn't as terrible as it is . So congratulations to Vin Diesel for showing the slightest bit of diversity. It is unfortunate that he saved it for this abomination of a comedy."
