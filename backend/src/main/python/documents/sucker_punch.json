It's probably the only case I can think of when saying that a movie reminds me of a video game is actually a complement. For sure, it's a \"check your brain at the door\" kind of flick, but I don't think they could have found more ways to pack what is obviously the nerdy dreams of Zack Snyder (and, by extension, every nerd) into one movie. It's all very silly, and Snyder needs to work on writing better dialogue, but it definitely exceeded my (somewhat tailored thanks to the critics) expectations."

And all of the characters were, well KICK ASS. 5 woman taking control of their life and trying to escape from a place they will rot and die in. They are fighting for their last chance and it was amazing! All 5 of the actress were breathtaking, so was the Madame. It was dark but still had you cheering for the girls to get free. The battle scenes were excellent, so was the script. Now if you dont like this movie maybe you should go see \"Justin Beibers\" new movie, because this movie was deep some people wont be able to grasp its dark and excellent message. In the movie it says we have the weapons we need, now we have to survive and fight. And the entire movie was them surviving and fighting for what was right...their FREEDOM. It was worth my 10 dollars, matter of fact im going to see it again tonight. LOVED IT, and i dont compare it to other movies because it's its own movie and we magnificent!"

It was poorly written, acted, directed, and a waste of some otherwise potentially attractive and talented actresses.  It was like a series of music videos, none of which were very good.  Heaven forbid if the studios let this yahoo direct the Superman reboot., as it will be even worse than the Brian Singer reboot.  What will we end up with, Superman in a g-string fighting a giant slow motion Lex Luther, neither with any character depth or decent dialogue?"

What action/thriller is deep or has such plot nowadays?  Sucker Punch, for me, reminded me of a mash up of comics, anime, video games and femme fatale style heroics which, if you're a fan of, you'll enjoy.   The other mash up involved here that is interesting is how it jumps from the 40s style burlesque era to a strange, steampunk like world in the fantasies.  This is, in no way, a perfect movie, and I'm not about to try to convince anyone that it has the best acting, CG, stunts or anything.  What I did like was that the movie got me interested in the girls' dilemmas and even though there wasn't much background except on Baby Doll, Rocket and Sweet Pea, there was enough there to make me want to see them make it to the end.  The idea that this girl, Baby Doll transforms so drastically from a school girl to a heroine in her alternate reality is just... well... cool.   It's all silliness in the end but the fact is there is some great entertainment in this movie if you let go of the critic in you and just enjoy it for what it is.  An action thriller.   And a pretty good one too."

A mix of elements that I personally love it! Japan with its feudal warriors, orcs and dragons, robots, WWII ... I loved the references.  The music choice was perfect. I can not stop listening! And Emily Browning really can sing! I loved the version of Sweet Dreams at the beginning! However, the film also has several drawbacks... First, the performances, just say it were a little disappointing, the girls could have had more charisma. I didn't found so captivating. But surely, Carla Gugino and Oscar Isaac were great! The script is weak, could have been much better handled, but it seems that the focus of the film was in fact the action. It even tries to pass a moral interesting, but it seemed that only remembered it at the beginning and end of the movie. Everything is a bit exaggerated and even! And the fights seemed like real games! But I think it will its acceptance of the film. After all, it all goes through the mind of Babydoll, so anything can happen. Ultimately, I think it's worth seeing if you like the theme. There is not an excellent script, but an action is really nice to watch."

I walked out of the cinema satisfied that I had just watched a movie that entertained and has left me pondering various elements for the last day or so. I will definitely watch it again to see if I can make more sense of it.Unlike so much of what Hollywood is producing lately this was different. The storyline, the style, the action sequences, the anachronistic elements of the plot...it was all obviously and deliberately chosen to push boundaries and buttons. Which boundaries and which buttons appears to depend on what you bring with you...those who want to see misogyny will see it, those who want to see simple video-game action will see it, those who want to see nonsensical plot will see it. Those who go in with an open mind will probably come away with something more.  I can see where the critics have traction - the plot is convoluted, the costumes are sexy, the action sequences seem to be video game inspired, there are sexist/misogynistic elements.BUTThere is more. There are so many layers and explanations for those layers and many and varied. Are the imaginings of Babydoll actually happening? Are her 'team' various parts of her psyche? Is the whole thing her lobotmised \"reality\"?  My friends and I love action movies, but of late they have become so predictable or over-the-top that we often pass comments and have little discussions during the film...not this one.

You must have a very abstract, hyper-thoughtful, and eccentric type of mind to understand Zack Snyder's works. Lots of people complain about not being able to relate to the characters in this movie. But they fail to see that the director is not interested in telling them a good story here. He has a certain idea, and being a champion of the visual element, presents it in a manner that is both exhilarating and satisfying to all and sundry. This movie is a graphical extravaganza, meant to depict a thought from Snyder's mental depths. If you expect to be a part of the story, prepare to be disappointed.

Stunning action sequences, beautiful cinematography, perfect soundtrack....Sucker Punch is the most fun I have had at the theater in a while.\r I loved the concept. The reality vs. action scenes were unique and kept me interested the whole time. The cinematography was absolutely stunning; it's definitely one of the best things about the film. The action/fighting scenes were unbelievable! The first major action sequence is as thrilling as the average movie climax. Just when you think the action can't get any more intense, the next scene arrives and delivers again. The thing I liked about the action was that none of the scenes were alike. So many films contain battle sequences that are basically identical, but Sucker Punch contains multiple scenes, all intense for different reasons.\r Overall, the acting is only okay, as I expected, but there were a few performances that really surprised me. Jena Malone gives a great great performance as Rocket. She steals every scene she's in...too bad she had very little substance to work with. Abbie Cornish also gives a good performance. In the beginning I wasn't impressed, but towards the second half of the film she really delivers. Oscar Isaac though gives the best performance as the villain, Blue.\r I completely disagree with the critics on this one, I'm not quite sure what they were looking for when they were watching this. This film is receiving a lot of criticism that it doesn't deserve. Personally, I found the film to be intriguing, intense, and completely original. I loved it!

This is very well handled; and it's very cool how people can come out with a lot of different theories about why everything happened the way it did and how none of them are wrong.\rSadly, there are other not so pleasant things that come along with the film, like the mediocre-good acting, the unnecessarily accelerated character development, some exaggerated scenes, the fact that in the action sequences our character can't die or at least we don't worry about it, and the sometimes dumb script.\rStill, it's a cool psychological action thriller that you are going to enjoy if you really try to understand it, and can make you think about it long after it's finished, as long as you allow it to do it."

This movie, if you pay attention, should force you to question the basest desires of your taste without resorting to a heavy handed dismissal. Remember, when the action sequences start, WE, the audience, are those deplorable characters looking for a cheap thrill before we consider the personal story that Sweet Pea alludes to.

This is a serious movie and a thinking movie despite its first appearances.

The most important part about this film is it ends with something that you will want to talk about, argue about and discuss as it's actually quite a smart film that plays off both the reality of sexual abuse in 1950's mental asylums and what the mind can do to deal with such situations. However saying ANY MORE will reduce your enjoyment of this movie. Just don't go in expecting 300 with chicks. This has more in common with an episode off the Twilight Zone than 300 (aside's from Snyder's son) and because of this I thoroughly enjoyed it.

      "text": "I very rarely write reviews as I see films as pure entertainment and what entertains one person may not always entertain another. But I had an urge to support this film by giving it a positive score, as I think it deserves it, even if it's seen as a meaningless piece of entertainment.I think a lot of people have missed the plot in more than one way. I think there are layers of symbolism that the critics have totally missed or do not understand and therefore simply see it as a rambling sequence of one action packed, effects showcase after another. The whole concept is an escape from reality, therefore to try and pigeon hole it in to some kind of reality, so it makes sense to you as a critic is simply going against the flow of the film and just not accepting it for what it is.Loved it and always will, it goes down in my list of all time favourites."

      "text": "For anyone at all familiar with Zack Snyder's \"Sucker Punch\", I'm going to say something very obvious: This is not a film in the traditional sense. It is a visual feast, an exercise in directorial self-indulgence, a self-important tale of excess violence, sexuality, and intensity. Much has been said of the obvious flaws in \"Sucker Punch.\" However, in spite of all of that, it remains imaginative, original, and deserves to be seen and discussed.I absolutely believe that this is the sort of film that requires the viewer to go in with a realistic expectation of what you will experience. Not in terms of knowing the plot or details of the story, but understanding that they are not going to see a typical film, with a typical story arc and typical characters. The story has shades of \"Pan's Labyrinth\" and the style blends Snyder's previous films \"300\", \"Dawn of the Dead\" and \"Watchmen\" with Anime and many popular adventure video games. The action is elaborate and often stunning, but exists mainly as an excuse to use every flashy directing trick in the post-Matrix book. This idea could have gotten old very fast but having a different style of combat each time we descended into Baby Doll's imagination kept things fresh enough to not lose momentum. The soundtrack is made up of remixed well-known tunes (including Queen, the Beatles, and Jefferson Airplane) and a pounding score that honestly does a lot towards keeping things interesting and pouring as much intensity and atmosphere into the scene as possible. The actual story to \"Sucker Punch\" may seem like little more than a device to get us to each action piece, but there is more substance to this film than the vast majority of critics have been willing to admit. I will not claim the acting to be anything more than it is: serviceable. Other than two of the main characters, little back story is provided and the other characters are there merely to provide other eye candy or in the mens case, be evil and give us a reason to care about the fate of \"baby doll\", the bombshell cover girl. But I have read many reviews that paint the story as an \"incoherent plot\" and a \"jumbled mess.\" This is one of those times where I wonder if I watched a different film, or if the large majority of the viewing public lacks the basic intellect or attention span to \"get\" any film that doesn't follow traditional narrative structure. I don't say this to be arrogant or rude, I really don't. But I do have to say it because once again a film with complaints such as these thrown out from all directions ended up being quite easy to follow. The plot was certainly coherent and featured an arc that concluded the story and themes presented for the main characters. The device of the main action scenes were clearly in the imagination of the main character to get through traumatic experiences. I realize that following a story from the real world, to an imagination, and then an imagination from there requires some attention be paid, but it is not too much to ask when it is laid out for the viewer. This is why I will defend Sucker Punch from those reviews that claim it is all visual impact, with no emotion or visceral stimulation. The overarching theme may be ridiculous, silly, or incredulous, but that doesn't mean it isn't there. To dismiss all of this as simply violent soft-core porn on the basis on the misogynistic school-girl outfits and dark subject matter is doing a disservice to the creator as well as it's audience.I may seem over defensive in my praise for the merits of \"Sucker Punch\", but as I previously stated this is nowhere close to a perfect film. In fact, it's almost impossible to give a rating to because you first must establish what you are rating. Is it my enjoyment of the picture? I certainly enjoyed myself from beginning to end. Should I rate it on a critical scale in terms of how well-made it is? Even to someone that absolutely loathed the story, subject matter, and characters, it would be impossible to deny the craft behind the camera of Zack Snyder. It is a well-produced film with absolutely gorgeous cinematography and many memorable visuals. But the drawbacks are as clear as day. It is over-the-top to an absurd degree. It is overly self-indulgent. It features a lot of mediocre acting. It contains cringe-worthy dialog. It's not surprising that many find the overall theme to be ridiculous. That's not even getting into the supposedly \"girl-power\" message being undermined by its clear objectifying nature. But \"Sucker Punch\" is unwilling to limit itself to audience expectations, riding the imagination of its creator and giving us something different and daring. In my opinion, this something we could use more of in today's film landscape. Love it or absolutely detest it, but don't dismiss \"Sucker Punch\" as just a mindless action flick. It at least gives a valiant attempt to do more. 7.5/10"

Sucker Punch delivered everything it promised in the preview, lots of stylish action catered to a fan-boy's sensibilities.  I especially enjoyed the soundtrack which fit with the movie really well.  Certainly not a masterpiece of writing or acting but it was pure fun to watch.  My biggest complaint would be that we didn't get enough character development considering it was an ensemble cast."
