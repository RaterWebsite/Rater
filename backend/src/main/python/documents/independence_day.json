I will admit that it has problems like a somewhat cheesy tone but I like the characters and the story flows nicely. Plus, the flying sequences are cool. The effects were probably groundbreaking back then and still hold up today, and the film looks great visually. Definitely check this one out if you haven\u2019t seen it already. If this film was a summer blockbuster then awesome because this would have been a great theater going experience."

Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, and Bill Pullman, star in this cheesy, over-the-top 90's action flick that is actually a masterful action film. For all of the films obvious shortcomings across the board, it is an incredibly well made and well crafted action film that sets the stakes, sticks to its rules, and comes up with unique and compelling ways to overcome the problems it puts before its heroes. Additionally, the creature design here is very nice and well done. Though it is dated in some spots, the aliens still look pretty cool. Heck, there is even some solid horror-esque moments here reminiscent of Alien combined with great references to Close Encounters of the Third Kind, 2001: A Space Odyssey, ET, and a few more that I am blanking on. Above all, Independence Day is simply entertaining. While that is often not enough to get the job done for me, it is here. While it may be everything I typically hate in a film, Independence Day stands as the exception and is a truly fun, lively, and bombastic experience."

We got the hero soldier who save the world one joke at the time, the nerd that was right all along and of course the America President that makes maybe the longest motivational speach in the history of movies (and of course he's also a badass pilot). When I first saw this, in 1996 I was a child, if I had to judge it then I would have said without a doubt that Independence Day is the best alien movie ever, so cool, so funny, so epic. I would probably have change my nationality to be a badass american like them. Of course opinions change when you grow up and so it does my judgement about this movie. Independence Day still remains an enjoiable movie, with decent acting, good actions and special effects and some memorable scenes (see the White House). But now I can also understand the irony behind this type of movies, with these american stereothipical heroes, the ridiculous presidential speech, all of the jokes that want to be so tough (some sort of \"I laugh in the face of danger\" type of thing - typical of the american blockbuster's era). After all I think it was the intent of Roland Emmerich (who isn't an american) to give this sort of sensation. The brave americans who save the world once again by smoking cigars, saying cheesy lines and punching aliens: \"Welcome to Earth!\". In the end I gladly rewatch it from time to time, with my VHS (with the Lenticular/ Hologram promo card), but mainly to laught about it."

It's a bit light on story, I don't wanna spoil, and it does have a purpose for the aliens, but I think the purpose could've been better.

I have seen this when I was little, and kind of grew up with it, but I grew up more with \"2012\" which is also one of favorites. Independence Day has great actors, Will Smith is a cool and funny guy just like in \"Hancock\" and \"I, robot\". He is very likable. Anyway, this is about aliens taking over our planet and the ships are just really huge they cover entire cities and that's its great to see. I have the movie and seen it many times and seen it on my RCN cable many times as well. The special effects and the destruction of major cities are just fabulous as humanity is faced with the aliens. Roland Emmerich I admire you and your movies. And I don't care if people hate you or don't like your movies because....I do not care....much.

A timeless film in its own right (not least because of the expertly-chosen cast and state-of-the-art special effects), its importance in the cultural zeitgeist cannot be understated. While it may not have been the first movie about aliens, or even about an alien invasion, it is the most copied, parodied, and referenced (the original Alien notwithstanding). If you are too young to have watched this movie when it originally came out in the year 1932, you only recognize it for what other works have made it out to be: a bland, uninspiring film that borrows heavily from the overblown action genera. However, if you are a boomer such as myself, you will immediately recognize the genius behind the masterpiece."

      "text": "The 4th of July is almost upon and what movie is fitting for Independence Day? Of course, the movie \"Independence Day\" by Roland Emmerich. The premise is simple, aliens have come and attacked Earth on the 4th of July and the planet but mostly America has got to stop them. I've watched this movie years ago so rewatching it will be a very interesting experience.One thing I've remembered while starting this movie is how amazing and tension-filled that intro is. The scene with mankind's footprint on the moon getting blown away by the alien ship and the people on earth panicking about the ship in the sky is good stuff.My biggest praise for this movie has got to be the visual effects though which still look great even today. I think everyone remembers it since it was all in the marketing but the iconic white house getting blown up by the alien ship is just phenomenal honestly. Looking at how the movie was made and finding out that they built a miniature white house and blown it up which is cool. All the action scenes in this movie are just very thrilling and exciting to watch with its fast-paced air battles and spectacular explosions. The first act with the alien destruction and the final third act with the war is just so good! The movie contains a lot of comedic moments especially from Will Smith and they all gave me a slight chuckle and work in the movie's favour.Speaking of Will Smith, this and Bad Boys are the movies that practically launched his career to action fame and watching this movie again I can see why. Will Smith is extremely charming, funny and awesome as \"Captain Steven Hiller\". He punched an alien in the face while giving a cheesy one-liner, what more could you ask for? Jeff Goldblum is also likeable as the tech expert \"David Levinson\" and Bill Pullman is charismatic as the American President \"Thomas J. Whitmore\" and gives one of the most memorable speeches in movie history. The supporting cast is also great in their variety of different performances from the weird to the serious and they all do a great job.The negatives of this movie are very clear and it is that the plot is just very thin and bland. However, this is kind of expected since the movie is just an alien invasion but the movie runs for 145 minutes which is LONG. So the director does a lot of padding which ruins the pacing of this movie. This is especially noticeable in the second act where it feels like everything is slowing down and coming to a halt just so they can find a way to bring all the characters together and it just drags. Additionally, the movie has to find a way for humans to fight back and win but it is not very convincing. You are required to ignore questioning the logic of the plot and characters and dialling down the sense of believability for this movies plot to work.While I did praise the actors for their performance, the characters themselves are very lacking in depth. I don't feel like I understand any of the characters motives or backstory and none of the main characters changes by the end of the movie either. I never really cared for any of the characters dying and there are moments I've feel where they want you the audience to feel something but it doesn't work because none of the characters is that interesting for us to care. Well except for the dog who is a character we all care for and has a great moment in the movie. Rewatching the movie I've noticed how stereotypical the characters were which is probably why this movie was a product of the 90s and wouldn't be allowed today necessarily.Overall, the movie is still a fun movie to watch and even to rewatch. The true main star of this movie is the visual effects with its stunning action pyrotechnics giving us some of the best destruction in movie history. The production and set design are great and the amount of practical stuff is astounding as well. However, the movie is pretty cheesy and dumb with a very stupid conclusion which I've still find dumb even during my rewatch. One line still sticks to mind is \"they'll never let you fly the Space Shuttle if you marry a stripper\" and honestly I still think about that because it shouldn't affect ones flying ability but apparently that is important. Nevertheless, this movie is just pure spectacle filled fun and no doubt watching this movie was an enjoyable time which is all that matters in over the top, cliche movies like these."

I'M BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACK!!!There is a large ensemble cast of good actors, some in career best roles, such as Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, Judd Hirsch, Randy Quaid, Vivica Fox.,and Harry Connick Jr. in a small role!The final battle with the major countries against this alien ship at the Area 51 is AMAZING, even in the mother's ship! :)Independence Day is a amazing, and a classic sci-fi movie of all time in 1996, and it's one of the best sci-fi alien attack movies ever! :DAlthough it is a very predicatable movie, but thankfully, it's amazing, always amazing!Hope you love my review! :)"

The Day After Tomorrow was decent, and 2012 wasn't the best, but at least it got me entertained with its science like Godzilla. However, one of his best works yet is a sci-fi action flick known as Independence Day. It revolves around an alien invasion on earth as a group of humans set out in convoys towards Area 51, a strange government testing ground where it is rumored the military has a captured alien spacecraft of their own. The survivors devise a plan to fight back against the enslaving aliens, and July 4th becomes the day humanity will fight for its freedom. We already know what it was about because we have seven days until Independence Day as a great holiday. Now I'm going to make my opinion. The only problem that I had with this movie was the special effects. They were kind of cheesy as if they came from the 1970s. As for the rest of the movie, everything turned out great. The acting was terrific, the sci-fi action was pretty damn cool, the storyline was well-paced, the stunts were very cool, and the music score from David Arnold was amazing. Three days ago, there has been great news that Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin have planned to make not only Independence Day 2, but Independence Day 3 as well and Will Smith will return for those sequels. I bid these guys good luck as Independence Day is not only one the best action movies of all time, but one of the best ones yet. Thumbs up from me. P.S. It's great that I have a different opinion over Roger Ebert and The Nostalgia Critic himself. 8/10"

It is basically a reimagination of \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d or lets say it is heavily influenced and has B movie charm and cheesiness. Also it has the pathos, spirit and patriotism that wins over the US audience. All together Roland Emmerich created a truly convincing movie that works well enough to ignore the weaknesses. Maybe it is one of the biggest dazzles in movies that hides its weaknesses so well that you recognize them only far later. Story: Shortly before the US independence day an enormous alien mother-ship arrives in the orbit of earth (Smaller moon size to be specific) and deploys a few dozen city size saucers that stay stationary above huge cities of earth. Because no successful contact could be made no one knows what to expect. This is the set up and the movie follows the story of a few protagonist in the following days. I avoided spoilers here but don't even know if it is needed. The movie, its story and a lot of scenes are close if not common movie knowledge. Like I said the movie pulls all the right strings to be entertaining. It is a good popcorn experience and worth watching. Of cause it is not an all time classic or in the realm of the best movies of all times. It has however a lot of memorable scenes, a good bit of humor and an enjoyable cast. Cast: We have a cast of really likable and good actors. There is Will Smith as ace pilot Steven Hiller, Jeff Goldblum as engineer David Levison and Bill Pullman as President and former ace pilot Thomas J. Whitmore. These 3 work well and get you invested into the / their stories. Then we have the support characters and lets start with Randy Quaid as Russell Casse who is probably the most memorable (side) character of the movie and steals the show. Judd Hirsch as Julius Levison delivers a good performance. Then there is Vivia A Fox as Jasmine Dubrow who also delivers a good performance as does James Rebhorn as Alber Nimzicki. Brent Spiner as Dr. Brackish Okun is really weak int the movie and I blame it on the script as he is a truly good and convincing actor. In total we have a solid to good performance with some weaknesses. I must admit here that we have a bit of cheesiness and maybe to much pathos and stereotypes. This can drag down the enjoyment and rating for others and I will say it is a valid point. Presentation: The special effects worked amazingly well back then. It helped a lot to create the atmosphere and feeling of the movie. The White House scene in particular is quite famous. The sets and other visuals look good too and there is no grave misstep in this category. The soundtrack was amazingly good and I fully praise the composer David Arnold for this. It is fondly remembered. Overall I repeat that in hindsight it was not a great movie but it pulled the right strings and was entertaining. It camouflaged its weaknesses well. However it earned its place in movie history for its impact and success. I would recommenced it to watch at least once to be able to discus it. Bonus knowledge: Despite different depictions in movies, TV series and books aliens would not even have to leave their solar system to wage war or destroy other civilizations. A Nicoll-Dyson beam combines a Dyson sphere with a death ray and there is the relativistic kill shot where you use the energy generation to speed up an object to high fractions of light speed. If at 98% light speed you have a reaction time of a week per light years distance and the relativistic speed makes an object far more destructive than any nuclear weapon we can build (Not planet destroying but civilization erasing except you use bigger objects which is an overkill)."

This airborne leviathan features a bunch of agreeably cardboard characters saving the human race from mass extermination in a way that proves as unavoidably entertaining as it is hopelessly cornball.\r Working in a vein that is unabashedly hokey, contrived and ultra-patriotic, the \u201cStargate\u201d team of director Roland Emmerich and co-writer/producer Dean Devlin clearly had great fun combining sure-fire elements from a bunch of mainstream genres in a way that is frankly intended to be overwhelming.\r For the most part it is, at least in the sense that the sheer volume and variety of mass destruction, casualties, moments of dire jeopardy, opportunities for heroism and, above all, special effects, are almost certainly without precedent.\r This is, in effect, the anti-\u201cClose Encounters,\u201d a throwback to ominous, paranoid thrillers such as \u201cThe War of the Worlds,\u201d\u201dThe Day the Earth Stood Still,\u201d\u201dWhen Worlds Collide,\u201d\u201dInvaders From Mars\u201d and television\u2019s \u201cV,\u201d a story in which the visitors from space have absolutely no interest in making nice with the earthlings and, in fact, have every intention of wiping them out so they can have Earth\u2019s resources to themselves. Lay on top of that an Irwin Allen aesthetic sense and 10,000 special effects and you have a definition of high-concept.\r The magnitude of the global threat is awesomely established in the teaser opening, which shows the black mother ship, itself a quarter the size of the moon, sailing through the lunar orbit on its way to its rendezvous with Earth. Shortly let loose are some 15-mile-wide saucers, which descend to hover directly over New York City, Washington and Los Angeles, along with other world capitals, causing no end of wonderment and panic.\r In vintage disaster-pic fashion, a host of characters from all walks of life is sketched in. For starters, there is David (Jeff Goldblum), a New York computer genius whose ability to analyze the aliens\u2019 communications code with his laptop could help expose their Achilles heel; Capt. Steven Hiller (Will Smith), a hot-dog fighter pilot from L.A. with an unfulfilled dream to be an astronaut; and U.S. President Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman), a rather green national leader widely regarded as a wimp despite his background as a combat pilot during the Gulf War.\r Although scenes of the lumbering warships parking themselves over the cities are eyefuls in themselves, the first real fireworks come 45 minutes in, as the spacecrafts open up their hulls to expose giant electromagnetic ray guns that simultaneously zap the soaring Library Tower in Los Angeles (where a bunch of SoCal nitwits are celebrating in welcome of the aliens), the Empire State Building and the White House. As Air Force One spectacularly manages to take off just inches ahead of onrushing flames, uncontrollable firestorms result in the destruction of all three cities and millions of casualties.\r And that\u2019s just act one. Air attacks on the alien ships reveal that they are surrounded by protective shields that ward off all weapons, but when hundreds of crustacean-like alien fighter ships zip out to engage the American planes, Hiller manages to make one crash and returns the gruesome-looking pilot to Area 51, a top-secret Nevada base where the president has taken refuge. There, 24 floors underground, the resident loony genius (Brent Spiner) reveals the existence of an alien spaceship captured long ago that just may be in working order, opening the door on a long-shot counterattack that plays out on the third day of the story, July 4.\r Without giving the game away, it\u2019s fair to say that everybody gets into the heroic final act: The president dons his flight suit once again, Hiller and David fly into outer space to take on the mother ship, and even an alky Vietnam vet (Randy Quaid) has his chance to go down in history.\r This is hardly a movie for viewers interested in plausibility or intelligence in storytelling, but Emmerich throws spectacularly pulpy events at the audience at such a pace that carping about logic is moot. It\u2019s more a matter of carefully selected elements having been stirred together with the obvious but effective touch Cecil B. DeMille learned how to apply not long after the dawn of cinema: cataclysm, elemental human ties, individual jeopardy, the boldest possible opposition of good and evil, life-and-death struggle, a little religion, brotherhood of the underdogs, ultimate triumph through ingenuity and heroism. It\u2019s all been done before, just not on this global scale.\r The never-ending special effects, while massively spectacular, are not always that special.\r Pic delivers its scariest scene when it momentarily decides to become a monster movie during an alien autopsy, but violence is mostly general and directed at objects rather than people, thereby further increasing the potential kid audience."

The film introduces our main characters pretty quickly and we get some understanding and inside to them -- but there could have been way more growth, depth and basic inside to them. Because a film is supposed to be about real people, not groovy action. We do get some basic romance between some of the characters, in an acceptable amount but not more. The characters in the story are very patriotic -- and much of the film got this \u201cwe\u2019re all in this together\u201d & \u201cfor the common good\u201d-feel, and it\u2019s a great ride with many one-liners. It\u2019s a pure popcorn flick, that might lack character depth and of course; less plot-twists & convenient events. But who gives a damn; it\u2019s a fun film -- for one viewing.\r Personal rating: 77/100\rCritical rating: 71/100"

There is not a bad cast here, a unique alien invasion of some kind. But the stupidity of the plot and the delusivity of the final battle only finally spoil the opinion of the film."

      "text": "One of those \"so bad its good\" films, this 1996 alien bonanza has breathtaking alien effects, decent acting and some great one liners. Will Smith delivers his usual cool and **** performance, while Jeff Goldblum is great as a nerdy computer scientist who is the first to decipher the alien countdown to the attack. Bill Pullman has a small role as the US President, not too much to say other than good job. A lot of people have hated this movie over the years, calling it effects over plot, but what did they expect from the director of the other sci-fi epic Stargate. I like the movie as far as the effects."

Will Smith crack pot lines throughout this movie are annoying, America is the best country in the world theme is freaken retarded, the characters are shallow and uninteresting, the story is pretty lame, and there are far too many illogical plot developments for this movie to be good. Asides from a few minutes of special effects which are pretty memorable, Indepence Day is a weak movie with weak characters and a predictable story."

      "text": "Painfully bad.\r The first movie was art. Every detail was painstakingly prepared and executed. The first movie was perfectly written and directed. The sequel, unfortunately, was a disaster.\r I will outline for you WHY Independence Day Resurgence was horrible:\r 1) Poor storyline. The plot was absolute garbage. Not even remotely realistic.\r 2) No suspense. You can clearly see what's going to  happen. The movie literally spoils itself.\r 3) Reckless directing. An alien chasing a schoolbus around the desert? Was the director on crack?\r 4) In the first movie Earth won thanks to cleverness and ingenuity - neither of which were present in the sequel.\r 5) The first movie attempted to emulate the workings of the US government at least to some degree. In the sequel, there's a trigger happy female President who gets everyone, including herself killed. She was as reckless as the director.\r 6) Spiner manages to pick up some of Roland Emmerich's slack but it isn't enough to save the movie.\r It really felt as if Emmerich was TRYING to make a lousy movie.\r I absolutely loved Independence Day. And I absolutely hated Independence Day Resurgence."

Still, maybe the best film by Hollywood's garbage man No.1 Roland Emmerich. 6/10"
