The actors do an excellent job. The entire cast is strong.They do try a little too hard at points to push the boundaries of what you can do with children in a movie. There is one scene that is especially uncomfortable. I'm not trying to censor, but ask yourself: how far is too far?The film has a good ending, but I felt a few parts could've been edited down. The film runs briskly at an hour and a half. Part of strength is it pacing, jumping constantly from situation to situation without driving a joke to death.

The boys create enjoyable characters and the pace only slows when they take time for the emotional friendship crap.

You would think that a film that has a script like an hour long special finale of the season, the co-writer and director Gene Stupnitsky would play safe on delivering this content with the promise and expectations he comes with. For, I think his confidence on directing this film is extraordinary. As a proof, you can see all the slow motion shots that he has installed in here. It is natural to take such scenes for granted or find it difficult to pull off, but his decisions doesn't go waste by, especially because his shots aren't bloating or exaggerating or celebrating, and instead is just mocking the seriousness and the priorities of these characters.And that remains to be their sense of humor towards.. well, everything. Their tendency to lean towards unintentional edgy humor whose birth is actually coming from the know-it-all attitude that every student ought to and does breathe in that stage of their life. Now, saying that or showing that isn't enough. Their definite knowledge or incompetency to grasp the adult social rigmarole is never enough for us to care about them.And hence every single character is given that kryptonite, no matter how hypothetical, that they collapse within a snap after coming in contact with. We, as an audience, too connect instantly with it. Not because it is a metaphor to something we can dot across the frame, but that very piece of information that they carry. There is no need to dig so deep or read between the lines in that aspect of the narration. For when it comes to ground this celebration into a- might I say shocking- vibrant message, the film holds on to our weakest nerve-- or should I say mine-- and it is, these Good Boys saying goodbye."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Hilarious from start to finish!

It doesn't always render a comedy unwatchable or even mirthless, but it will typically diminish the potential returns for entertainment overall, ultimately making the experience feel a bit like going back and listening to the greatest hits of a band from your teen years that you've already moved on from. \"Oh, yeah. I remember this one. Neat.\" Thankfully, though, this issue doesn't actually comprise the epitaph of \"Good Boys.\" Yes, the best bits are in the numerous \"red band\" trailers, but there are a number of surprise laughs along the way, whether it be the use of an unforeseen alternate take or a full-blown entire joke you actually haven't seen yet. There's also the added benefit of emotional resonance -- or at least a valid attempt at conjuring it up -- and a trio of performances that should elicit a smile at the minimum. It's a pleasant, albeit familiar, effort in a realm of cinema that's all too focused on topicality and timeliness, featuring a noted emphasis on telling funny jokes first before even considering the fact that they'll be coming from the mouths of children."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Good Boys is a cute and funny film about three sixth-grade best friends caught between the pressures to grow up and a desire to stay young.

I wanted to turn it off after the first 15 minutes because it was that boring and unfunny.  I am a huge fan of crude humor movies like Blockers and Superbad and Knocked Up, etc., but this is just garbage.  The script is just horrendous.The only worse movie than this I've seen in my life is Scary Movie 5, which gets a 0.  The problem here isn't the bad language at all, but how FORCED the terrible jokes are that always fall flat.  I've never seen dumber jokes in a R rated movie before.

He decides to use his father\u2019s drone to spy on some older girls in the neighborhood to gather the necessary information.  When the drone goes missing, Max and his pals experience a frantic couple of days trying to replace the drone before Max\u2019s dad finds out.  In many ways, \u201cGood Boys\u201d is a youthful version of the film \u201cSuperbad,\u201d with the handicap that it doesn\u2019t have an older, more accomplished cast that can use its force of personality to make the holes in the script less obvious.  As a result, \u201cGood Boys\u201d is itself superbad.The script for this film just seems lazy.  Basically, it\u2019s a two-note tune \u2013 12 year olds dropping f-bombs at every opportunity while demonstrating they are completely interested in but completely clueless about anything having to do with sex.  Whenever the writers don\u2019t know what to do, expect an explosion of profanity and/or the appearance of a sex toy.  (Admittedly, the appearance of \u201cDad\u2019s CPR doll\u201d was funny, the first couple of times.)Some critics have appreciated this film because of the juxtaposition of the crude humor with \u201csweet\u201d moments when the three sixth graders briefly confront disappointment and the recognition that the texture of their lives is constantly changing.  I disagree with this kind assessment, because none of the life lessons seem hard-earned.  All the sweet moments rely on the protagonists reverting to child-like behavior, not any sense of forward movement, additional insight or personal growth.Ultimately, \u201cGood Boys\u201d feels like a comedy sketch much too short to support the weight of a full-length movie."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Wow.

Jacob Tremblay\u2019s last film was so bad that The Guardian dared people to go see it and some writers breathlessly marveled at other writers\u2019 willingness to sit through the whole film. All these things considered, I had feared that Good Boys would be a toothless reproduction of a classic Apatow comedy, one that cleaved too closely to its source material and tried to squeeze the last few drops of humor out of tired scenes from a well-tread genre with slightly younger actors. But.I am pretty frustrated by how much I liked this film. I\u2019m surprised by how much of the film was an indictment of toxic masculinity and a companion piece to the other coming-of-age (\u201calso called a Bildungsroman if you\u2019re feeling fancy,\u201d says Wife) movie from this summer, Booksmart. Good Boys proves that no one director has a monopoly on foul-mouthed boyhood antics and that comedies about children don\u2019t need adult cameos to put butts in seats.Both films are about growing apart. Both films focus on inflection points in relationships and try to find ways to navigate compassionate separation. Good Boys does so through the motif of hermit crabs outgrowing their shells. The Venn diagram of competence and adventurousness allows for the three leads to inhibit different permutations of the same qualities, present variations on a theme, which creates some wonderful moments of tension and complementary motivations. The gun scene is probably my favorite, unexpectedly perfect moment in the movie.The movie parodies the self-seriousness of sixth grade, the rigid social structures and etiquette that regulates all interactions between children. Parody does not spare the toxic masculinity of frat culture\u2013in a succinct and cutting scene that leaves no stone unturned, including the wonderfully repugnant jubilee of a young man\u2019s, \u201cGuys! She just dropped all charges!\u201d Even scenes that reuse material from past coming-of-age films, the stuff in the trailer I was so worried about, find a novel way to spin jokes that feels fresh and clever.Do not feel guilty about this unadulterated joy of a film, one whose quick and joke-packed script has a rolling laugh for nearly the entire film. In fact, when a joke fails, like the lone incest joke of the film that left Wife stunned, the silence of the audience is itself pretty humorous and shows how energetic and enterprising the script is, even if it doesn\u2019t always get the tone of its humor right."}], "recommendations": ["neighbors", "knocked_up", "jackass_presents_bad_grandpa", "ted_2", "hall_pass", "neighbors_2_sorority_rising", "superbad", "the_40_year_old_virgin", "the_happytime_murders", "jexi", "21_jump_street", "bridesmaids", "cloudy_with_a_chance_of_meatballs", "step_brothers", "this_is_the_end", "the_hangover", "rough_night", "a_million_ways_to_die_in_the_west", "ted", "funny_people", "sisters", "the_change_up", "the_croods_a_new_age", "the_dictator", "sausage_party"]}
