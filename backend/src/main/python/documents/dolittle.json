Robert Downey Jr's performance is a little bit worse than in Avengers: Endgame. A story is cool at first, but then it's getting more embarrassing in every minute. Also, a scene with dragon [Also it isn't he, but she] was one of the worst things I ever have seen in cinematography history because it looked like a fetish/porn or whatever it is [I'm a fan of dragons and this moment offends me.]. Overall an original book and first movie based on this book are much better than this sh*t."

      "text": "\u201cWe've no choice but to embark on this perilous journey.\u201d - Me walking into the auditorium.\u2018Dolittle\u2019...oh boy. I actually watched this movie a month early when I went to Australia for a family holiday, because it was released early over there for some reason. I kept quiet for awhile cause I didn\u2019t want to warn people about the storm that was coming. The storm of Dolittle. I watched this in a full house with plenty of children and couple of adults. There was a little kid and his grandma sitting next to me and throughout the movie the kid would constantly ask his grandma that he wanted to go home, but was pinned down to sit through it until the end. Poor kid.This is Robert Downey, Jr.'s first non-Iron Man role since \u2018The Judge\u2019 back in 2014, which is quite embarrassing. I can tell Downey is so into the role, because he\u2019s doing five different accents all at once. Welsh, Scottish, Irish, English and South Africa. Even Downey himself couldn\u2019t hold this mess together and it\u2019s a strange follow up to the highest grossing movie of all time \u2018Endgame\u2019. However the one thing I hated the most were the animals themselves. Like, I freaking hated all the animals. Every single one of them has an annoying character trait. I wish only death on them. I hope the fox gets skinned alive and hung up on a tree, but quickly gets forgotten, so days past and now it\u2019s rotten and covered in flies. I hope the giraffe gets decapitated just like the giraffe in \u2018The Hangover Part III\u2019. I hope the squirrel becomes roadkill after a car runs over his irritating little body, but I guess it has to be either a horses hoof or somebody\u2019s shoe since cars weren\u2019t around that time. I hope the dog gets put down since he\u2019s \u201cnot feeling so good\u201d. I hope the parrot chokes on a peanut after mistaking it for something else. I hope the duck suddenly gets depressed and turns itself into a duck sandwich, just so I can buy it and throw it in the bin. I hope the ostrich shoves it\u2019s head up someone\u2019s ass and breaks its own **** neck. I hope the polar bear gets smothered to death by his stupid winter hat, and then his body gets nuked and paints the Arctic snow in red, because it\u2019s justice to all the seals he killed in the past. Rest in peaces, bro. I hope the gorilla dies of a heart attack, since he\u2019s so frightened of everything. There\u2019s a straightforward message for children about how being brave is all fine and dandy, but being scared is nothing to be ashamed of. In reality, I wanted to yell out \u201cquit being wuss and help them out you **** but since I was in a screen filled with family and children, I kept my inner demons to myself.The only animal I liked was a Tiger named Barry, voiced by Ralph Fiennes. If I was Barry, I too would try to kill Dolittle. I find it ironic that a British actor is trying to kill an American who\u2019s attempting to do the whole United Kingdoms accent. The visual effects looked really unfinished and stuck out like a sore thumb whenever it interreacted with human beings. Perhaps it needed more time to be worked on, I guess.The movie is kind of boring as well, because none of the characters were developed enough for me to be engrossed in this world or the actual story, so I checked out very early on. It lacks imagination all across the board and you can predict everything that\u2019s going to happen. Also why is there a dragon in a Dolittle movie? And why dose Dolittle shoves his whole arm up the dragons ass? Not very family friendly at all. There even made a movie reference to \u2018The Godfather\u2019 as a terrible joke that dosen\u2019t make any sense when you really break it down. This takes place in 19th-century England, years and years before the movie was made and released, so already that\u2019s confusing for both kids and even adults. Overall rating: I hated the movie, but at the same time I admire in away. How can a movie that was so expensive to make filled with Oscar nominees and winners with a acclaim director Stephen Gaghan can feel so amateur."

      "text": "This might be the worst film that I have ever seen in theaters, and if not, it is still definitely in the bottom three. It seemed that nobody involved with the making of this film really cared at all. Robert Downey completely half-assed his performance, which included a frustratingly inconsistent \"British\" accent which at most points sounded like somebody doing a bad Scottish accent. All the animals in the film were completely forgettable or incredibly annoying. The squirrel character in particular was painful to watch because of how unfunny he was. The presentation of this film was completely forgettable. The cinematography might have been impressive at some points if the film wasn't so engulfed in CGI, but for the most part it was bland. I literally don't remember anything about the music of this film. The plot was pretty dumb as well. The pirate captain character went from hating Dolittle's guts to helping Dolittle on his journey in the span of around 5 minutes, and as far as I know, there was no reason for this change of heart except that it was needed to progress the plot. The climax of the story is utterly stupid, and culminated in a ridiculously juvenile scene involving a dragon. There were tons of little inconsistencies in the film as well, and things were very poorly explained throughout, but I can't be compelled to go into depth about them here because I don't feel like dedicating any more effort to thinking about this dumb film. I'd probably recommend it for children, but even then, there are hundreds of children's films that are better than Dolittle."

There is an almost non stop music score that is in constant competition with the dialog (meaning the music and he dialog are at the same volume and it was hard to differentiate the two). That with the sound effects made it an actual cacophony. I watched the credits to see where the film's sound was mixed and was blown away to see it was done buy Skywalker sound sound which is the best in the business. It was just weird. I could hardly understand Downey's dialog half the time. Also there was a gag every second, it was just too much. There was just no down time to listen to any story or character development. I think re-edited it could be better to the point of it being an \"okay\" film but as it is wasn't very good. Too bad because I wanted to like it."

Considering his star power, he's the least interesting thing in the movie. His character sets out on an adventure with a young apprentice and a menagerie of personable animals to acquire a special cure for the Queen of England. What children will enjoy most (and yes, this is a film for kids) is the animals. A stellar lineup of actors are voicing them, often with enjoyable personalities. It's a bit sad that the writers felt necessary to cater to today's style, by dropping modern cultural references and even contemporary slang. Still, the creature comments provide the only fun in this ungainly escapade."

      "text": "More misguided and uninspired than it is just plain \"bad\" in my opinion, Stephen Gaghan's \"Dolittle\" represents the textbook case of a studio pouring funds into an adaptation of a shaky IP, not being pleased with the results, and then hacking it to bits in order to cut the runtime so it can get screened more often in theaters. The greatest shame, however, lies not in the questionable effects, iffy plotting, or spotty performance work. The greatest shame is that, I think there was something \"there\" with this one -- a potentially pleasant story, with satisfying ,emotional undertones and a great sense of whimsy to it. It's just that this movie didn't know what it wanted to be. It has the soul of a PG-13 film (see Robert Downey Jr.'s misanthropic, bitter turn as the titular veterinarian and widower) and the frills and feathers of a G-rated romp (see. . .everything else). Do I feel particularly bad for those involved? Not necessarily. It's a misfire, but I'm certain everyone involved will work once more. I just hope they've taken any/all creative lessons they've learned from this experience to heart."

      "text": "Dolittle is simultaneously my favorite and least favorite film of 2020. Dolittle shows that having a talented cast but giving them nothing to work with can have disastrous effects. I think Robert Downey Jr. is a great actor but what was he thinking with this movie. In fact, what was any of the actors thinking when they signed on. Most of these actors are Oscar nominees or Oscar winners and they choose to do this. All of their performances are terrible especially Downey which really sucks. He has just a smidge of charm but it\u2019s overshadowed by his terrible accent and dialogue. He puts on this Welsh accent and you can hardly make out a word he is saying. The script only makes his awkward accent even worse. The dialogue is very unnatural and awkward and doesn\u2019t allow for jokes to be clever but instead forced. The humor for this film is awful. It all comes down to fart jokes and getting hit in the groin jokes. It\u2019s incredibly unfunny and really took me out of the film. What really made me change my score was a joke involving a Dragon and a release of gas. I completely gave up on the film at that point. All of the other characters present are dull and obnoxious. The characters don\u2019t get developed at all. They have one flaw/character trait that defines them. They have character arcs but they are all resolved in one or two scenes. The visual effects aren\u2019t terrible but they aren\u2019t that great. In some scenes, they look fine but in others they look pretty bad. The film is all around lifeless and boring. The only reason I can think of to Universal Pictures making this movie was to keep the license to the Dr. Dolittle property. I was bored out of my mind while watching this. The characters were unappealing so I wasn\u2019t interested when any of them appeared on screen. The only time I wasn\u2019t bored was the animation segment in the beginning of the film which looks nice but the voice over dialogue was terrible. At certain points in the film, a character will be saying something on screen but the dialogue would be completely different. It was incredibly obnoxious and distracting. Overall, Dolittle takes an impressive cast and completely wastes them on a soulless, boring, unfunny, and unappealing film."
