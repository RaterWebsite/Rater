The wonderful color grading, style, and edgy material are gone this time around, and replaced with bad pacing, a horrible script, and over the top acting. I'm not saying the first one had Academy award winning performances or anything like that, but it seemed so more cliche and superhero like this time around, and I wasn't really feeling it. Jim Carry shines every time he is on the screen, and makes an amazing follow up to Nicolas Cages best performance in decades, but he probably only has 30 minutes of screen-time total. Which is a shame.

Maybe I had it coming, I let down my guard and thought that this might be one of the rare instances a sequel does a film good. This film shouldn't be called Kick-Ass 2, it should be called Hit Girl. The entire movie revolves around her and maybe that's not such a bad thing.\r I'll admit the movie was entertaining, but the first film was more than that. In a weird, satirical way, it was inspiring. This movie lacked that because the main theme was overacting and over-editing. It missed the genius realism that Kick Ass held and instead gave us characters that felt cartoonish, unrealistic, and overpowered. The scene that got to me most was that of Hit Girl fighting Mother Russia, it just reminded me over and over of Kung Fu Hustle, which was a great film, but it was BUILT to be funny violence.

Please, do NOT listen to these snobby condescending critics, thinking they're hot s**t for ripping apart a fim that others loved. I know it's their opinions, but Jesus are they over criticising aspects of the movie. And don't say \"they're criticising the film because they're critics.\" I'm not talking about in general, I'm talking about aspects. Some critics say that \"You should do ANYTHING apart from seeing this film.\" Are you kidding me? I can see why some people might not like this film, but why the f**k would doing a puzzle beat watching this film? Are you seriously that brain dead? Anyway, onto what was good in this film. Every character worked superbly in Kick Ass 2. The big name actors  Jim Carrey, Christopher Mintz Plasse, Aaron Taylor- Johnson and Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz.) do an AMAZING job playing their characters, the score is as awesome as it was with the first one, the action is thrilling, and all scenes stand out as a significant, and memorable moment. Some things that have changed, are such as: the much more hilarious sections, the graphic and somewhat disturbing take on it's comic book counter part and the range of superheroes. (SPOILER WARNING AHEAD) Some things that I didn't like, were the: faceless emotions when a character was killed off, and the sad excuse of relationship endings, just so Dave could have dirty (maybe unprotected) sex with night  Probably my biggest hatred with the film was the climax with Mindy's conflict between the popular high school girls. This scene was very stupid, but it only lasted a few seconds, but man was it just flat out STUPID.\r(SPOILER WARNING OVER). All in all, if you liked the first one, see this film, if you like superheroes, see this film, if you like the kill count high, and the blood levels even higher, see this film.

I hate that the critic scores are low but I honestly kind of figured they would be and I see why they made it so low, to a film's core this film wouldn't be looked at as a masterpiece, and they couldn't exactly retain the same shock factor the first one had because Hit-Girl was only 11 or 12 years old in it.

Of course there many things about the movie that I liked but a lot more that I hated. The thing that bothered me the most was the whole \"mean girls\" story arch with Hit-Girl, it just didn't work and didn't fit in.

A savvy huckster provocateur, blessed with Jerry Bruckheimer\u2019s blockbuster instincts and Bret Easton Ellis\u2019 gift for pissing people off, Millar has conquered the cape-and-cowl industry by putting \"edgy,\" attention-grabbing spins on superhero mythos. This second adaptation of his flagship title pulls back a little on the showy repugnance of its source material; the unsavory scene described above, for example, ends with a performance-anxiety joke instead of a rape. Yet even with its edges sanded down, Kick-Ass 2 is unmistakably Millaresque\u2014a juvenile comedy of excess, in which skewering adolescent power fantasies looks an awful lot like indulging in them.\r As before, the diamond in the rough is Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, reprising the role of foul-mouthed, adolescent vigilante Hit Girl. Determined to honor her father\u2019s dying wishes, the orphaned avenger hangs up her mask and blades, turning to face the equally daunting obstacles of high-school. (Her rivalry with the mean girls culminates in a quintessentially Millar money shot.) Left to clean up the streets alone, the titular everyhero (Aaron Taylor-Johnson, bland as ever) falls in with a motley crew of fellow costumed civilians, led by a born-again bruiser (Jim Carrey, on movie-star duty in Nicolas Cage\u2019s absence.) On the other end of the good-to-evil divide is Christopher Mintz-Plasse, still hurt about the way Kick-Ass blew his mobster father up with a bazooka. Slipping into black-leather bondage gear, he reinvents himself as the world\u2019s first supervillain **** and begins assembling an army of thugs. The film can\u2019t seem to decide if his character is a joke or a genuine threat, and that\u2019s a pity because there are hints of actual menace in Mintz-Plasse\u2019s volcanic hissy fits.\r Like most second chapters in comic-book series, Kick-Ass 2 is better than its predecessor, though there was really no place to go but up. New writer-director Jeff Wadlow (Never Back Down) handles the jarring shifts from vulgar banter to Peter Parkerish hand-wringing to blood-spurting carnage no better than Matthew Vaughn did. The tonal schizophrenia extends to the film\u2019s world, which is meant to be realistic\u2014note the references to Twitter and viral videos, as well as a focus on the medical consequences of playing hero\u2014but often feels as cartoonishly outsize as Joel Schumacher\u2019s Gotham. Building to a deeply underwhelming battle royale, Kick-Ass 2 stumbles every once in a while, as if by accident, into a poignant moment. There\u2019s something oddly endearing, for instance, about the scene in which every member of the amateur Justice League runs through his or her traumatic backstory. And then there\u2019s Moretz, whose character is suddenly afflicted with the inconvenient emergence of hormonal desire. The actress once again makes the most of her part\u2014though not even Hit Girl could overcome the awfulness of Millar-approved mouthfuls like \u201cI\u2019m gonna go Saudi Arabia on your ass.\u201d"}, {"rating": "0", "text": "La suite du tr\u00e8s perfectible Kick-Ass sombre dans les bas-fonds de la nullit\u00e9... et se compla\u00eet avec une complaisance des plus douteuses dans la simple idiotie et la super d\u00e9bilit\u00e9 : un \"cocktail\" sans doute id\u00e9al pour les ados mongolos et autres adulescents rest\u00e9s bloqu\u00e9s \u00e0 leurs 12 ans d'\u00e2ge mental.Une suite qui sent mauvais l'opportunisme bassement mercantile et la cupidit\u00e9 de bas \u00e9tage ; une suite incroyablement basse du front et basse de plafond, \u00e9tonnamment mal film\u00e9e : un ensemble d\u00e9bectant qui file la migraine en une petite demi-heure et fait tomber dans le coma de la stupidit\u00e9 au-del\u00e0."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Do you think it's funny if a guy is a silly costume who is about to start a gang rape of a woman can't get his dick hard, so they just beat the living  out of her instead?

There are a few scenes of more normal teen age behavior where she can pull at your heart strings, especially at the hands of a particulary vicious popular girl.\rI predict good things for Moretz in the future.    The rest however is a mixed bag that has a very irritating super villain who calls himself  which is more pointless than offensive.    His lisp, whether intentional or not is very annoying.\rJim Carrey has a relatively small role as a former mob hit man who finds Jesus and trains the good guy bunch led by Kick Ass.    Even his presence is downplayed, and he doesn't have a huge role.\rWhile I didn't miss the message of superheroes being just regular brave folk doing what's right, Kick Ass falls on its ass due to cliche after cliche and gratuitous violence meant to give it an edge, but in this case is used to try to give the film some extra oomph if you will.

Remember how touching was big daddy\u2019s love for little kick girl when he would say \u201cChild, your inventiveness is so wonderful.\u201d Remember that hilarious beginning scene with the superhero we thought was our protagonist turning out to be just someone else who was mentally ill? The sequel is starting to dissolve around the edges. Gory fight scenes are less and less realistic and actually begin to get boring (except for kick girl\u2019s!). What is doing well in the sequel is the comedic quality of the dialogue, the funny lines, and most of all the mystique of kick girl. What is it with her costume anyway? It is such a perfect vision. Kick girl is such a wonderful vision of a classic archetype. She represents anima in an early developmental but extremely potent state. Given this, it is no wonder she has propelled to such stardom especially with boys and even men. But even as a child, she is not FOR children. It is unfortunate in a way that her potency is rooted so entirely in violence. Theoretically it could have been based on many things. In it\u2019s current incarnation it defines the Kick-Ass brand however, and isolates away this potency into an unrealistic basis which only Kick Girl can really own. Quite a brilliant form of \u2018copyright\u2019 actually."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This movie was fantastic! I was a huge fan of the first Kick-Ass movie and when I first heard the rumors of Kick-Ass 2 Balls To the Wall I was excited. The acting was great especially from The  Kick-Ass himself seems like a better hero than he ever was before and Hit Girl is still a bad ass. Jim Carreys performance was great but he wasn't in the movie enough. I'd say he had twenty minutes of screen time which was a big disappointment. A big problem with this movie is that they entered so many new characters but they never had any character progression. But even with that you don't even notice it.\r Just a quick message I would like to see the final Kick-Ass movie come out so please support the movie by buying it instead of pirating it online."}], "recommendations": ["kick_ass", "the_condemned", "venom_let_there_be_carnage", "the_green_hornet", "the_spy_next_door", "deadpool_2", "21_jump_street", "teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles", "the_a_team", "the_tax_collector", "this_means_war", "the_expendables_3", "the_expendables_2", "baywatch", "machete", "deadpool", "kingsman_the_golden_circle", "the_expendables", "xxx_return_of_xander_cage", "i_am_number_four", "rambo", "machete_kills", "the_twilight_saga_eclipse", "the_babysitter_killer_queen", "mission_impossible_iii"]}
