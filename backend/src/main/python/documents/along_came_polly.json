Some stupendously unoriginal ideas meet Ben Stiller going to the Farrelly Brothers' well once to often.\r For example blind sweater wearing ferrets are not funny or cute for that matter and what ganja toking screenwriter would think so. (John Hamburg actually who penned the much funnier Zoolander as well as Meet the Parents)\r The bathroom humor is not funny and kills the romantic plot. Stiller uses a decorative bath towel instead of toilet paper on a first date with Jennifer Aniston. The fact that they have a second date pushes this movie into the realm of science fiction. I've known woman to end a ten-year marriage for less.\r Some ideas were funny on their own (Philip Seymour Hoffman's child actor character for example) but not nearly enough are done with them and we are quickly back to Dharma and Greg um excuse me Stiller and Aniston. Actually if it wasn't for Hoffman as well as Alec Baldwin's Jewish boss character and Bryan Brown's Australian eccentric there wouldn't have been much of a laugh during the entire film.\r It's pretty sad when you are wishing the leads would leave the screen so we can get back to the funny stuff. (Though Anniston does look hot in her PG-13 sex scene.\r The director (John Hamburg again) cut Debra Messing's rap song as not in tone with the film (seen in deleted scenes). He was right it wasn't in tone with the rest of the film. It was freaking hilarious.
