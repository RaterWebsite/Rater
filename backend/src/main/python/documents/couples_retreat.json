It's inevitable, cliched and boring but I kinda had fun watching this movie I find it comforting and relaxing, also the characters are like able the chemistry that the actors have with one another is good. Dave (Vince Vaughn who also wrote the script) and Ronnie (Malin Akerman), Jason (Jason Bateman) and Cynthia (Kirsten Bell) and Joey (Jon Favreau who also wrote the script) and Lucy (Kirstin Davis) including Shane (Faizon Love) and his young girlfriend Trudy (Kali Hawk). The group use to include Shane and Jennifer but their divorced she's gone. Jason and Cynthia's marriage is in trouble, their deciding whether they want to get divorced or not as they explain in their Powerpoint presentation as they explain to their friends. The only reason they wanted their friends to go was because an order to come with them an order to get the \"group rate\" package, the only one they can afford. So the friends go on the trip, and they learn many things about each other that they didn't know before like Dave and Ronnie think their marriage is \"something to work through.\" Joey and Lucy can't even stand looking at each other, so Joey thinks about cheating on her. Shane and Trudy are having trouble relating to each other to their age difference. What really bugs me about this movie is the script is written by Favreau and Vaughn also Dana Fox, two actors who are funny and talented yet this movie isn't all that funny I don't know what was happening when they were writing that script. But overall I enjoyed this movie despite it's lazy, cliched, but the dialogue that the two comedic star write is humorous and entertaining. 3.5 out of 5 stars"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b\u300b```````````````````````````````"}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Despite a gorgeous setting and funny performances with great characters, Couples Retreat is nothing more than a star studded big paycheck for all the actors.

The story is really stupid and full of plot holes, no one wanted to go, but Vaughn gets roped into it and they all go?

Four couples with issues, some known well in advance, and some which arise during their stay at the Eden West Resort, whose program director is so stereotypically French, it's like he has a mime stuck up his a**. When Marcel(Jean Reno) puts pressure on Shane(Faizon Love), a commando-practicing obese black man, to take off his drawers for a couples skills training exercise, he relents, and scores an obligatory laugh from moviegoers, because big ones are supposed to be funny. It becomes less funny, however, if you set this relationship dynamic in a historical context, where Bora Bora continues to be a French colony. Clearly ashamed about the rolls of belly fat hanging over his body, Shane's friends seem like fake friends, as they allow Marcel's unreasonable request to go by without anybody ever opening their mouths in protest. Both the women, and the men, must really want to see Shane's p****. On all counts, \"Couples Retreat\" is just so dishonest, because it pretends to be innocuous and coy. Here's yet another example of a film that reeks of meddling from studio execs, who insist that all the characters be likable. That the couples are, and boring. Some of the vacationers have cheating on their minds, in particular, the former high school football star(John Favreau) and his wife(Kristen Davis), but they never act on this impulse, since that would force the screenplay to go to places it isn't permitted to go.

Although the (far too few) interactions between Vaughn and Favreau were fairly amusing and showed the benefit of their extensive work together on screen, the rest of the cast had zero chemistry. Furthermore, most of the jokes pretty much consisted of sight gags that barely warranted a chuckle (such as the scene where Faizon Love drops trou). This movie also fell into the trap of forcing Vince Vaughn into his rapid fire, mini-monologue schtick when it didn't make any sense. The least they could have done was have at least one of the couples not wind up together, but instead the writers/director/producers (whoever) chose the rode more frequently traveled. A mess."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "I've never been to a movie where the editing was so poor that it was a tangible distraction. Scenes that were just feeling like they were starting to develop cut to something completely different without warning. I honestly thought at least twice that somone had skipped a reel. Meanwhile, other scenes dragged on and/or felt pointless. Don't understand the point of Vince Vaughan co-signing for the motorcycle. Don't get the 30 second rainstorm. Those are only two examples of how contrived this film felt. Several complete scenes just left the viewer thinking ??? I'm still trying to figure out the shark scene, and still can't piece together how three of the four couples got back together instead of sealing their doom based on what they said to each other. And the relationship expert himself? So are we supposed to think he's a genius who achieved massive success or a total fraud? Again: ??? I fully get I shouldn't be asking so many questions and just enjoying the movie instead.
