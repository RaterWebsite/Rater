Saw 3 shows how sick and messed up Jigsaw is but yet it shows his reason behind things and how he gives people a chance to survive the games rather than just torture. It also shows the downfall of Amanda and how no one can be Jigsaw. The movie is much more \"dark\" than the other two and I like that. It has its twists, although the other two, in my opinion, had better twists. But, Saw 3 has better plot and character development, and of course, it has blood, tons of it."

If you are a hardcore/semi-hardcore saw fan, this should be on your must-see list for it explains the previous stories also."

With Jigsaw on his death bed dying of a brain tumour and his apprentice Amanda being a pretty stubborn **** a doctor and her husband must play their own games to earn back their lives. Though the plot is pretty crappy the traps are nice and finally some good gore rather than the **** few litres of blood we have been used to over the past couple of years. Intestines, brains and even some mulched up pigs are thrown into the line up with the most disgusting Saw yet."

Lets hope 4,5 and 6 are better than the first three. My ratings for the movies thus far: Saw -7.1 Saw ||- 3.4 Saw |||- 3.9. The first was the best because it played with real character development and showed plot twists while achiving low-budget but brillant scares and always keeping you intrested with good acting. The second was only there for the purpose of money and proved to be a complete waste of time: Watching people brutally suffer for pleasure while showing no real plot and just making the viewer sligtly disturbed with ketchup gore. The Third: A girl takes control of the killing making it more fun. But the unorginal scares and copy-cat script makes the movie dull and uneffective. The gore is real but not revolutionary and the acting is all together dreadful.  The Saws, in general, suck."

      "text": "This is probably the most \"human\" of the Saw films. You're actually allowed to get under the characters' skin this time round, and given time to care for the sympathetic protagonists, a melancholic surgeon (Bahar Soomekh) kidnapped to care for the dying John Kramer, and a grieving father (Angus Macfadyen) who is forced by Kramer to confront those responsible for the death of his young son. Tobin Bell is still great as Jigsaw, and steals the show despite being bedridden throughout the film, but it is Jigsaw's apprentice Amanda (Shawnee Smith) who is actually more terrifying than her mentor. Without Jigsaw's strict (if misguided) moral code, she's more like a rabid dog than a calculated killer with purpose, and actually seems to relish the misery she puts others through on her master's orders. There are some particularly nasty and inventive traps, the best of which unusually for a \"torture porn\" film actually doesn't involve bodily destruction, but instead rancid pig carcasses are turned into slurry and dumped on the victim. The film is generally quite engaging and keeps your interest until the final act which well and truly begins to ramble and comes across as rather preachy. The now traditional Saw \"twist\" doesn't come as a surprise either, making me miss the ingenuity of the first installment's spectacular ending. Saw III is far better than Saw II because it's written by series masterminds Leigh Wannell and James Wan, and only directed by Darren Lynn Bousman (one of the failures of the second film was that Bousman wrote and directed, and he is far less talented as a screenwriter than he is behind the camera) and so the film feels more connected to the first film than any other in the series. That said, the message of the franchise (if there is one) has well and truly been lost by this point, and the third film brings very few new ideas to the table. You can appreciate Saw III for decent writing, good performances and a certain perverse joy in death in cruel and unusual ways, but the twisted novelty of the series is beginning to wear off, showing a glimpse of the ugly truth at its heart. Perhaps they should have ended Jigsaw's blood-soaked saga here, but as well we know, box office returns can be ever so persuasive..."

I would compare the whole film to Star Wars: Episode II, which was mainly about Anakin's relationship with Padm\u00e9 and it was one of the worst parts for me. Unfortunately, this is the same problem and it is mostly a relationship that I don't really know if I can call a relationship. But I won't spoiler. In addition, we have other characters, which are significantly less than the two. This is not a bad thing at all, but unfortunately I found it uninteresting and did not even reach the knees of the previous ones. The whole film seemed so useless to me and even the final resolution didn't save it much, which was good, but lags behind the previous ones. Unfortunately, this is an average film that I do not recommend."

Firstly, the storyline does not become apparent until exactly one full hour has passed. I was hoping for some originality here, and it didn't deliver. The entire first hour of the movie was a long, drawn out mess that basically rehashed the Saw I and II formula. Secondly, the ENTIRE MOVIE is on steroids, shot as if it is a music video. Cameras are zipping here, zipping there, flashing back, etc. On TV, this may not be an issue. But on the damn big screens, where their horrible resolution for motion shots (you MUST know what I mean -- everything blurs!), you may find yourself annoyed as hell. The violence and gore was good, but come on! Hasn't every horror movie lately been a blood-soaked mess?

Unlike Saw II, however, which was just gross and boring this second sequel is at least laughably bad.

The bad part about it is that the Jigsaw killer kept giving away the ending of the movie, and it was made very apparent who was actually benig \"tested\" due to all of the emotions that character was portraying (she was the worst actor in the movie to me as well). Visually, it was definitely a cut above the rest, I am an avid horror film spectator and never, I mean NEVER feel like anything is too graphic to endure. This movie definitely made me cringe, especially in the opening sequence. For those who say there was no story line, what movie were you watching? There is definitely a story line, which is fairly decent (not great or spectacular), at least until the very end. Anyone who thought differently is being waaaayy too critical, because the plot was actually well drawn out. The very final test was the most ridiculous lead-in to the sequel they have ever come up with, and will result in disaster if they try to formulate it into a Saw 4. But the rest of the movie was enjoyable and interesting at least. Don't watch this movie expecting it to be a true horror movie, because it is actually more of a Drama. And if you go into it expecting it to be better than the first, you will definitely be dissapointed. If you rent or buy the movie and watch it with a fresh prospective (and an open mind), you may actually enjoy it."
