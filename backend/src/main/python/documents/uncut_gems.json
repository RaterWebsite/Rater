As Sandler's character continues to spiral downward in a pit of his own creation, you cannot help but watch and cheer him on to dig deeper. As the final scene concludes it leaves a sense of exhaustion in its wake, but it is not long before that exhaustion is replaced by a hunger for more."

      "text": "HOLY (insert expletive here!!!!) This has got to be the most anxiety-inducing film I've seen in a LONG time! In this film, Adam Sandler plays a charismatic New York jeweler, who finds himself in over his head with several gambling debts he owes to various loan sharks and criminals throughout the city. In order to pay his debts, he must resort to desperate measures, such as pawning or selling various valuables, including a beautiful opal stone, and even betting thousands of dollars on Kevin Garnett in Celtics games. Sandler definitely plays against type in this film, ditching his silly comedy and slapstick humor he's become so associated with (for better or worse.) However, some of his humor and style does squeak in a little here and there, but it takes on a whole new meaning in a more dramatic and tense context, which this film carries in spades! He's never been better and finds a great balance for his character, cheeky and carefree at times, but also no-nonsense in others. Other familiar faces include Idina Menzel as his wife, and Celtics player Kevin Garnett as himself. Storywise, it kept me thoroughly anxious for nearly the whole time, as I constantly kept wondering how he'd be able to get himself out of various situations throughout the film. The pace gradually picks up speed, and my feelings of nervousness and anticipation only increased as the film progressed, while the film's final five minutes or so literally making my jaw drop! Overall, it's dazzling, tense, and doesn't let up until the very end! And what's more, it's undoubtedly a surprising and impressive change of pace and showcase for Sandler, who truly delivers an unforgettable career-best performance!"

While I love the break neck pace, and the unrelenting, constantly building anxiety, there were several story elements that could have been cut to make a more streamlined, tightly focused feature. I am a big fan of Good Time, the first film by the Safdie Brothers, and I honestly think Uncut Gems is just a messier, less focused Good Time.That being said, I was a huge fan of Adam Sandler's performance. It really was one of the best of the year, and he capably carries the movie on his shoulders. Kevin Garnett has a breakout performance that I really enjoyed, and the performances of Lakeith Stanfield and Eric Bogosian were excellent additions to the cast. The score is great, and the cinematography is really well done. I loved how the titular gem in the movie was given such mythical properties by the characters.Overall, Uncut Gems is not a bad movie at all. It just wasn't my favorite of the year."

You've got high intensity, quick claustrophobic cuts that really bring out the dire situations of Howard (Sandler), who will most justly and most likely pick up some best actor noms as well as some wins elsewhere, and I'd not be surprised to see the screenplay up for awards.  Certainly deserving.  This film knocks on many doors. Not just gambling and gems. There's worldly social commentary, a little bit of Jewish history and modern culture.//  You're a fly on the wall to the method of Howards madness, and no matter how tumultuous, you'll never want to get off his ride, even when you know he's wrong.  Sandler sold it solid, with a great a surprising ensemble cast paving the way for him to shine.  I see a little later-Lumet in this film, and some sprinkling of David O Russell.  But inspirations aside, this film does anything but rip on it, but rather creates a new 21 century film, through unique editing, cuts keep the story always cresting, and one more time, Sandler kills. Knocks em dead. I give it a solid 8/10."

Let's talk about the essence of this film, Adam Sandler materializes Howard Ratner with all his baggage, the bad and the good, he embodies this character and brings it to life, I'm really tempted to call this his best work to date, it's a big claim but it deserves it, \"Punch Drunk Love\" was something else but this is just breathtaking, honestly, it just wows.The Safdies brothers really went for it with \"Uncut Gems\", their acid-infused filmmaking is on full display yet again, they shaped the narrative near damn flawlessly and gave Sandler a fantastic story to work with. A power trip that will play with your primal senses, that's the best way to describe it, absolutely great."

They complain about it being too anxiety ridden and the ending to be unsatisfactory.  In reality, the purpose of the movie is to make you hate Adam Sandler and to play with the emotion of greed and how that can ultimately get you killed (as he does). everything happened to illustrate that point.  His addiction to gambling getting in the way, him getting **** over at the auction was all a way of setting up the inevitable ending and the greed he has for something that has consumed him and his reality. That\u2019s why at the end the bullet hole is zoomed in on and we see allof the sparkling colors.  This shot was completely ripped from the beginning scene to further drive that point across.  The Gem is HIM he can\u2019t think of anything else. As far as the writing and cinematography is concerned that is perfection in my eyes. It is there to make the watcher feel the intensity of the characters and the situation their in.  The editors and the director want to make you hate Howie and they SUCCEED.  As he keeps digging himself deeper in this hole i found myself just yelling at him to stop."

People constantly talking or yelling over each other while the brilliant sound work made the space around them feel so tight, but incredibly claustrophobic.While I like \u2018Good Time\u2019 a little more, but man what a rush.Adam Sandler is absolutely terrific as the greedy and sleazy Howard Ratner. If he's working with a good director, a strong supporting cast, and an interesting concept, Sandler will thrive. We follow Howard Ratner, a jewelry store owner in New York with a serious gambling problem that makes the hole his standing in deeper and deeper. Despite every terrible decision his character made...I still felt sorry for him. I think it has to do with Sandler's devilish charm that won me over into pitting such a petty crook. He isn\u2019t a loser, he\u2019s a winner who doesn't win. It\u2019s one of his best performance right beside \u2018Punch Drunk Love\u2019.Benny and Josh Safdie are such vibrant directors that can inject so much style while also having a harsh look to it, which ties in with the slimy side of business. The Safdie Brothers are building a solid career for themselves. Darius Khondji outstanding cinematography is the glue that holds this high tension of a movie together.I loved the score from Daniel Lopatin, which will often drown out the dialogue as the retro rift comes blasting through. On the other hand, there\u2019s also a slow mystical vibe that Lopatin composes that gave me a surreal feeling of levitating.Kevin Garnett is surprisingly really good in this movie. A professional basketball player actually delivering a solid performance is almost unheard of. It kinda reminds me of Tyler Perry \u2018Gone Girl\u2019, in terms of your expectations from them vs what you got. I also couldn\u2019t believe this is Julia Fox first acting debut, because she\u2019s fantastic in the movie.Overall rating: While I\u2019m only two movies into their filmography, Safdie Brothers are upon my favorite working directors.I hope they make another movie like 'Good Time' & 'Uncut Gems', so it can called the LSD trilogy."

He\u2019s got so many plates spinning (jewelry store, 3 kids, mistress, wife, black opal, bookie, prostate, pawned rings, creditors, auction, relatives), and we\u2019re shown over and over that he\u2019s completely incompetent in every area of his life and unlikely to keep any of them afloat. It\u2019s just a question of which plate is going to fall first. We\u2019re left to wonder how this person lacking common sense ever came to own a jewelry store in Manhattan\u2019s prestigious diamond district or what his wife and mistress ever saw in him in the first place. This is a guy who\u2019s willing to make huge risks to get rich quick, so I never believed for a second he would ever take the 5 months necessary to meticulously research the mining industry in Somalia and figure out how to successfully acquire that black opal. And if he is that kind of careful investor he wouldn\u2019t just impulsively loan it out 10 minutes after it arrives! I also didn\u2019t believe this manic reckless adrenaline junkie would ever have the presence of mind to schedule a prostate exam. His death was a forgone conclusion; the only question was how. If the Safdies wanted to really surprise us they should have given us a happy ending where all those plates remain safe due to sheer luck mixed with some previously unseen genius on Howard\u2019s part. As for the relentless intensity, it was mostly without variation and thus felt monotonous, redundant and just noisy. Having said that, there's enough here (mostly Sandler's performance) that warrants 2.5 stars. I know there\u2019s a barrage of critics who loved it; to each his own."

The Safdie Brothers have always been an intriguing pair for me and their last film, Good Time, was one of the best films I saw in 2017, which was packed with incredible performances. Their directing style is very different and off the wall and it shines through here as well. The film is frantically paced (for all the good reasons), and doesn't let the viewer catch their breath for even a minute. LaKeith Stanfield and Julia Fox were very good in their roles as well."

Your present is a couple gems about Uncut Gems. This movie stars and I do mean stars Adam Sandler in what some may say is his best performance. It\u2019s a mix of classic Sandler with terrible teeth and good acting. Sandler plays a jeweler who constantly finds himself too deep in the situations he\u2019s created. Let\u2019s see if he can dig himself out.The summary above is the most I can give you without ruining the already simple storyline. Strangely enough, the movie is predictable but not ruined by that fact. We\u2019ve seen this plot in many movies before, but it\u2019s the execution and the cast that differentiates this movie. Sandler, LaKeith Stanfield, Julia Fox, others and yes even Kevin Garnett do a really great job in this movie. Sandler\u2019s performance, minus the teeth, was the perfect stereotypical portrayal of this character. When we he is high, we are high. When he is manic, we feel manic. Ultimately, I found myself saying how deep can my man go and get out of, and boy, do we find out.Here are the trouble spots of this movie, which might be controversial. This movie is \u201ctoo loud\u201d for some viewers. Everything in this movie is loud, over the top and in your face. While I enjoyed most of it, I do realize how this atmosphere/culture displayed could be \u201cannoying or offensive\u201d to certain viewers. I can understand how certain viewers just wouldn\u2019t appreciate the contemporary nature of things occurring in the movie. Some might say it\u2019s too \u201curban\u201d. *side eyes those people* But truthfully, the movie was on the borderline of being too in someone\u2019s face.Long story short, Uncut Gems is a film that is both super predictable but nevertheless not ruined by its predictability. The intense nature of this film ultimately lends itself to being seen. Now, I leave that up to you all. You absolutely don\u2019t need to see this in the theater, but I will note the nature of the big screen and music could amplify the viewing nature. Your best bet is watching this at home with a few betting friends and make a few drinking game wagers through the film."

Adam Sandler plays a frenzied, somewhat obnoxious jeweler in New York City. The big score that drives the narrative is complicated by his side trips into compulsive gambling, the resulting multiple debtors and marital infidelity. Sandler relishes the opportunity to play this oversize character. The Safdie's have crafted the film with an adrenaline-fused style that propels the action with a convincing supporting cast, noisy situations and an energy continually verging on chaos and calamity. In an attempt to tweak the tension even more, they\u2019ve added a rather incongruous soundtrack. Some will find this film (and Sandler's performance) mesmerizing. Although I appreciated what the directors are doing, I never found Sandler's character sympathetic or compelling."

This was easily one of the exceptions due mostly to Sandler's dedication he brought into the grimy and slimy character of Howard. The story is straightforward enough, but the constant problematic conundrums that arise at all corners keep the intensity at high levels throughout and you cannot wait to see what unfolds though you know it will be inevitably troublesome. Once everything comes to a head, the story's tension unravels into a shocking finish. If you're a fan of Adam Sandler, you'll need to understand this is a different version that he saves for his most passionate roles, though he's still the same brilliant funnyman we all know in parts. Some of the soundtrack is overwhelming and off putting at times but really that's my only complaint. Otherwise it's a solid dramatic thriller."

Things just never feel easy in this movie. There's always some ticking clock, force of pushback, or complication preventing our main character from getting what he wants. It places you in a state of perpetual unease and it's quite well done. And speaking of main characters, one can't possibly opine on \"Uncut Gems\" without discussing Adam Sandler's performance. What else is there to say that hasn't already been said? It's simply sublime, if performances this slimy and disgusting could ever be. Every event and amount of pressure mounted perfectly manifests itself into Sandler's behavior and demeanor, giving you the honest to God impression that this guy's toilet of a life is really starting to overflow. And like \"Good Time,\" this film definitely steers away from the crowd-pleasing ending, though it may do so a bit too drastically for my tastes. Where \"Good Time's\" ending felt bittersweet and apt, this one simply makes you realize what you've really just finished -- a real workout. I'd be shocked if even the most emotionally jacked human beings didn't leave feeling sore."

The film is a two-hour cringefest thanks to its sporadic unsettling visuals (a colonoscopy with no plot relevance, really!?) and a multidirectional plotline laced with interminable violence. The pacing of the film was so rapid-fire that I found myself without any time to catch my breath or process what I had just learned/seen. Having to check my phone to understand who was who and what was going on (seriously), I missed the next detail of the movie. Not to mention that the plotline was met with an abrupt and nonconclusive ending.However, where the film redeems itself is in its engagement by virtue of strong acting performances and character development from Sandler and Menzel. The embodiment of fictional characters as portrayed by these actors develops an emotional bond with the audience, leading to an instantaneous investment in the film's endeavors. Plus, there is something to be said for a messy plot that plays mind games: you seek for answers. Unfortunately, I left the theater unsatisfied with the ambiguity that was both preestablished and unanswered."

Shocking ending that made me gasp out loud, which I never do.  I have minor heart disease, and with about 15 minutes left in the movie, I was overwhelmed and needed to stand up and raise my arms to reduce tension and breathe deeply.  It worked, and I was able to enjoy the ending.  I have to admit, there were times I wanted to leave because of the foolish choices being made, but I was so invested I just couldn't.

      "text": "I thought this movie was trash. No likable characters. Chaotic plot with characters who deserve everything that comes to them. Takes 2 hours to really go anywhere and ends in a meaningless fashion. Honestly one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I wish I never spent the time or money."

      "text": "The Safdie Bros's movies are just like nothing else on the big screen. I loved Good Time, and I was anticipated this movie more than anything else this season. It delivers, with just minor drawbacks (which I can't go into - as they're plot spoilers).  As someone who is obsessed with the NBA and the way that it interfaces with sports gambling, I'm, I guess you would say, the target audience.  And Sandler is incredible, as I suspected he would be.  Adel Dazeem is also really good in a smaller role.  However, the big find in this film is Julia Fox as Howard's (Sandler's) girlfriend.  She's the x-factor in this fun, fast-paced, and ultimately frenzied pic.  If there were ever a reason to go see a film on the big screen - (screw all that comic book garbage) - this is it."

      "text": "Very good movie with an excellent lead performance from Adam Sandler. Much has been said about the adrenaline pace and frenetic direction of the Sadfie Brothers. The movie lives up to those claims of it being a shot of adrenaline  and making you feel the anxiety of Sandler's character. I was hooked from the moment it started right up to the end. The movie reminded me at times of Silver Linings Playbook, specifically Robert De Niro's, superstitious gambler character in that movie. Uncut Gems has some hilarious moments where Kevin Garnett and Adam Sandler both get caught up in superstitions and Sandler's character is a gambling addict if there ever was one. The final act of the movie contains the all time crazy bet in movie history with more parlays than one can count. Strongly recommend this movie. For those who are thinking about seeing the movie but are not sure, should check out \"Good Time\" on Amazon Prime. That was the Sadfie's brothers last movie and contains a similar frenetic style."
