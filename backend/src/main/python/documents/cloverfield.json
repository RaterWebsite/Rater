The whole thing could have been great-besides the fact that there was no script and no image. Everything was just a blurry image of stupidness screams. I kept praying that the monster-whatever it was(you never find out) would eat the camera guy to end my misery. It was torture! Watching this movie was t--o-r-t-u-r-e! There is no reason to go and see this movie. Unless of course you are looking for a bad time, big headache, and somehow to waste your money. This could have been a good movie.. But it wasn't. The trailer was more interesting than the movie. I knew as much as I did before I saw the movie from when I left the theater. The only thing I learned was what it feels like to vomit all over the person next to me. The movie can be summed up in one word: worthless. Can they even call this a movie? From what I've seen the producers have no right in calling this a movie. How did they manage to put this on the big screen?

The movie ends \"My name is Rob Anderson and if you are watching this, you know more about this than I do\". No Rob, actually I don't...because no monster ever attacked NY and we haven't invented time travel so there is no way this video could have come from the future.

There were at least 2 people that actually threw up in the theater while I was there. I sat near the back of the theater because of the potential motion sickness. I still got sick. The director should have at least used the steady shot on the camera. It was like they had to throw the \"Im using a camcorder and I need you to know it\" over and over again. Great story but horrible visuals aka camcorder view. It should have been used sparingly. This movie could have been made by anyone and probably been easier to watch than this version.

Loved the documentary feel and don't agree that the monster's origins, motive, etc, needed explaining. It wasn't really about the monster, after all. The party section went on a bit too long and it didn't succeed in making me feel attached to the characters, the film really improved when we got to the part with the monster attacking. The only complaint I would make about this film is that to me it never seemed very believable that the characters would go to their certain deaths on the off-chance of saving someone's ex-girlfriend. If they had been a couple going back to save their baby (left with babysitters across town?) then it would have made a lot more sense."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Once you get past the whole shaky cam thing (which really made the movie) its just your generic monster movie plot. It was an enjoyable film but it was poorly executed."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "a hectic subway ride that lasts for more than an hour..CloverfieldReeves's field of horror is so fixated on the crisp of the thrills, that it fails to stand on its structure let along impute a heat on the soul. It is as cold as the world depicted in here, it is basically a razzle dazzle that usual alien invaded tale follows. The only thing it has draw in its viewers is through its perspective which unfortunately is exciting in its initial stage but grows questionable as it ages on screen. The camera work keeps us so busy that you are always attentive towards it, which unfortunately wears down quickly and is then just a hectic subway ride that lasts for more than an hour; you might leave the screen with a headache. It is awfully loud and unnecessarily brimmed with explosives that is clearly mind-numbing. The narration is fast and gripping but it certainly isn't layered or thought provoking and takes its genre sci-fi for granted. Forcibly installed humor shucks away the somewhat earned intensity on each step. The entire feature is imbalanced on its self-created ground that it fails to walk on and just ends up fumbling down the road for attaining its moot closure. There isn't much range offered to the actors to flaunt in aptly but it is not that the allotted acts are on the mark by these performers; they need a better boost. Aforementioned, the sound effects are loud and blunt and the visual effects aren't convincing enough to terrify the audience as it was anticipated. Reeves's efforts are clearly visible but it also isn't enough to float this sinking script whose ironically, the strength of the concept itself weighs it down like an anchor. Cloverfield is a wiped out field before it even habitats itself, it only works as a dinner table discussion, clearly not as a major motion picture."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "This right here is a very under-rated movie. It was a very cool and successful expeiriment that I thought did exceedingly well. It not only kept my attention and stayed interesting throughout the whole thing, it began a new era of film. It brought the idea of making the movie look like it was home videoed to the attention of the film industry. I also love the producer(J.J. Abrams) and the director did well with this movie too(Matt Reeves). So after all of that about how good it is your probably asking yourself, \"why did he give it a 7/10?\" Well the movie isn't completely perfect. I thought for one it could have been a bit longer. It only being like one hour and 10 minutes was kinda a let down. Also, I know it was like home videoed but there was a little too much zooming in and out and shaking of the camera. It didn't have the best angles either. It also was hard to see I feel like. The only time you can watch it is if your in a dark area because in a lot of the parts the glare makes it hard to see the screen and whats going on. One more thing is the actors. They didn't do the best job of acting in this. I guess most of them were just begginning actoras and actresses but they could have done a little better. The only one that did a professional job was Lizzy Caplin(Marlena). She was pretty good in it but then again she has been in a couple of movies before this one. She's not the best acteress though for sure. There is many others better than her, no defense Lizzy. I guess T.J. Miller(Hud) had done a prett y good job too. He had also been in a few movies before too. So those are a few things that this movie lacks and if they make a remake... add these please. So this movie is a pretty good movie with a good plotline and amazing special effects. I highly reccommend you see it."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "I thought the special effeects were excellent, but i didn' like how the storyline was or the ending.

The use of the similar \"cin\u00c3\u00a9ma v\u00c3\u00a9rit\u00c3\u00a9\" and \"found footage\" styles are prevalent to the film's plot, as it enhances the believability of the disaster which the story is centered on. At first, I didn't think it was going to be that great of a film, as it began with a light-hearted mood, but by twenty minutes into it, once the whole disaster started to take place, I was thrilled. Also, the ending was not that great, and it left me flummoxed by how complex it was, but think of the endings to other films made in \"found footage\" style--especially THE LAST EXORCISM--if you may: they were the same way. Overall, I thought this was a fantastic film. To create yet another monster was a brilliant idea, and for once well-tackled. But if there's one thing about CLOVERFIELD that really goes beyond expectations, it's the cinematography and how ingeniously every action is captured--even if it's on home video."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "This was an effective film the first time around.

I wont recommend this movie, I wont recommend this DVD when it comes out or using this DVD as cup coaster, well maybe as a coaster."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "This movie was a classic version of Godzilla, it was very supsenseful and very....shakey. The camera looked like it was a digital hand held camera I only saw the Cloverfield monster once just before the camera man got eaten, Yum.
