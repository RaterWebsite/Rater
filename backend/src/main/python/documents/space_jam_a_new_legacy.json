It had a lot of things helping it's mediocrity: the soundtrack (quad city dj's epic opening), it had the most beloved athlete in the world, the novelty of the animation blended into real life. It was a commercial the same that the Lego movie is a commercial. This new movie has none of those elements and it was painfully cringe at times."

Sadly, this lives down to those expectations. LeBron James is as stiff as his predecessor Michael Jordan in this reboot of the 1996 film. He and his young son (played by an actor) get trapped in a digital world where they\u2019re pitted against each other by AI (Don Cheadle, desperately trying to bring the funny). James enlists the classic Looney Tunes characters for his team, which should be where the comedy comes, but alas, their wisecracks never land\u2026they just play to their physical gag stereotypes. Not only is the movie never funny, but in an attempt to add a family friendly heart, there\u2019s too much time wasted on the father/son relationship. Young\u2019uns will be able to enjoy the animated whimsy, but anyone with any standards will just yawn or stop playback early."

The original Space Jam did a good job at retaining a Loony Tunes feel despite having real actors. But this doesn't even feel like Loony Tunes. This movie was done by a completely different director and it really shows. This director paid zero homage to the original movie and did his own thing. And for what it's worth, I enjoyed the original Space Jam."

World theme park and HBO MAX. I spent more of my time looking at the background just to see how many characters the studio put in, while I wasn't watching the actual game. Very distracting. I nearly fell a sleep watching this.It will be interesting to see people try and defend this ****"

If you can watch it for free I'd tell you not to because they should be paying you to test out this disappointment. This movie had it coming with making Lola less attractive (and attacking people for it great job!) Taking out a character because weak reason that even a child can destroy, changing the already corny plot, making this movie more diverse ( by that they meant putting a ton of black actors and barely anything else that's diversity right?) And finally putting Le James and knowing people don't like the guy was the biggest blow they could've done. Hire anyone besides a person who isn't a actor it's like hiring a lawyer who isn't a lawyer or a plumber who isn't a plumber because it'll go well right? What people forget is the damage they do to the characters and everyone involved.They lost money no way are they using the loony toons again in something. James will get dunked on by everyone for failing to act and making a decent movie. Black actors will look bad and say \"it's because something something racism\" No that doesn't work that way. Just because you bombed doesn't mean it's a race problem just make a freaking good movie. The real problem with this movie is how it does everything wrong and doesn't get a cancel mob on it. Media in general is killing off every single thing that was good and now we get this \"diversity\" woke trash (again hiring 80% or more black cast isn't diversity its the same problem but the other way around) hope you like Anime andKorean webtoons because thank God they know what sells!"

      "text": "Pros:- the film has a good mood, it manages to make us laugh.- Visually it is very beautiful.Cons:- Mixed up the present time of electronic games with basketball.- They made fun of Michael Jordan, instead of the WB being more endearing and trying to convince him to have a cameo in the film.- WB bragging about what they have (that's why the film was approved), they put in a lot of unnecessary stuff they have. Server Verse, because it's fashionable to put a multiverse and there's no creativity for new things.- I consider this film to be anything but Space Jam. They used the name only as bait to catch people.Worst:Very hypocritical movie. Send the message to be ourselves, but change the look of the less sexualized Lola Bunny.Sexualized.... A current world where sexualization is exposed everywhere: fluid gender, non-binary, homosexuality, women showing off on the internet naked, girls cosplaying in tiny clothes to gain a following on social media, women showing off intimate parts on Tik Tok to earn likes and money... But the look of a 1996 cartoon is not good. 1996 was better than 2021. Do you know why? The minority had access to the internet. Today, with globalization, everyone can communicate: those who think and those who have the brains to decorate.They sealed Pepe le Pew accusing it of being a harassment cartoon, instead of the fabulous geniuses of the WB board putting Pepe le Pew just romantic but without grabbing Penelope.They almost sealed the Ligeirinho, accused of racism and prejudice against the Mexicans. But building a wall to separate the United States from Mexico and killing anyone trying to cross the border is very ethical.Society is preventing society itself from living. It will get to the point where everyone is lying vegetating on top of a bed. If you try to walk, you're going to be bothering someone."

Not only that with all that\u2019s going on I wanted to be right there to make sure they weren\u2019t trying to push some ideas onto my kids. With that being said this movie was terrible. I gave it a chance I really did. Don Cheadle carried the movie which says a lot since Lebron was the main character. I cringed the whole time they referred to him as a king. My kids actually thought he was a king and I of course had to explain to them that he in fact wasn\u2019t. The voices of the Looney Tunes sounded like cheap knock offs. Zendaya being \u201ca great actress\u201d couldn\u2019t even pull off a cartoon voice as always because she can\u2019t act. The only funny parts about the movie was when they referenced GOT \u201cWinter is coming\u201d and when Daffy thought Michael B. Jordan was Michael Jordan. Other than that my kids got bored and we put on the Space Jam with Michael Jordan. They ended up having more laughs with that one. They\u2019ve been watching that one on repeat ever since. Overall I give this a generous 1 for the king."
