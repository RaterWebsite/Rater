A shallow and mediocre construction of performative allyship, featuring a career worst performance by Justin Timberlake. This film spun a vapid and illogical of a cisgender hero looking to force a sense of patriarchal acceptance. You are encouraged to feel a sense of wholesomeness upon witnessing the spoon-fed character \u201cevolution\u201d at hand. I, however, couldn\u2019t reach for my waste basket fast enough."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "excellent[ ek-suh-luhnt ]adjectivepossessing outstanding quality or superior merit; remarkably good."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Perfectly innocent. It\u2019s familiar, but not manipulative or pandering like a Hillbilly Elegy. Timberlake is solid. Worth your time if you have Apple TV+, but otherwise you\u2019ll never know you missed it."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "A great movie that sparks a light into a very relevant subject in our society. JT's acting performance is impressive as well!"}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Interesting drama premise with issues. I loved the story, setting and characters. The casting was excellent (apart from the lead imo). Firstly JT feels like a mis cast - great performance but for me just too recognizable a face to get truly immersed. Background music playing constantly really detracts from any of the character building scenes to form a connection with me. Also the editing is so quick to cut from scene to scene without ever spending time allowing the audience to experience some of the heavier moments with the characters. Overall what should have been exceptional came across as quite average. Worth a watch."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Watched \"Palmer\" on Apple TV (they extended my free trial until July!).  \"Palmer\" stars Justin Timberlake as a recently paroled convict who returns home and ends up taking care of a child from a broken home.    As most of the critics have said, this movie covers familiar territory. That is, a troubled man gets a new look on life when taking care of someone weaker than himself. The story and script are pedestrian but I am still rating this as \"6\" (somewhat above average) on the strength of Justin Timberlake's performance which is very good as well as the 2 main supporting players (Ryder Allen as Sam and Alisha Wainwright as Maggie).  The movie is watchable if you have Apple TV already but I wouldn't sign up for Apple TV just for this movie."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Justin Timberlake was decent enough but if you're like me, you've seen this story countless times before.

With the 6 month free AppleTV+ trial, this movie stood out the most. Justin Timberlake is awesome, and proves he can be an outstanding actor. I loved the personality of the main character and the father-son like relationship between him and Sam. Love the movie. Definitely recommend it."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "(Mauro Lanari)Wanting to tackle too many topics at once, it loses depth, is confused and leaves you confused, moves you while you already forget it.

Very interesting plot with some ups and downs."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "First wow what a heart-warming movie. I got to take my hat off to Justin on this one. And also the rest of the cast too.
