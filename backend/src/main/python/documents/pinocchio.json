      "text": "As a fluent Italian I find it bewildering that some have suggested that hearing the Italian version makes a significant difference ... Benigni's constant yelling was incredibly irritating, the pacing was tortuous, and the neverending parade of pointless set-pieces made me wonder if anyone ever asked anyone else \"why?\" during any stage in the planning and editing of this film. This film is a complete and utter failure in so many ways that I was embarrassed for its set designer and cinematographer ... that their incredible work went to such a narcissistic waste of time and money."

      "text": "This movie contains my favorite movie scene of all times. When the Blue fairy (Nicoletta Braschi) says : \"E vero, Medoro, il tempo non esiste\".  If I have to pick ONE movie from all movie history, I will pick this one. A great take on the Collodi original. From that point of view the Disney cartoon sucked. It was even anti-Italian. The only negative thing about Benigni's Pinocchio was the English dubbed version. Atrocious. The Italian original was simply glorious."

Instead of a half-assed explanation of \"he was always real.\""
