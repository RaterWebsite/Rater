      "text": "\u201cFading Gigolo\u201d has Sharon Stone, crossing and uncrossing her legs in a very short skirt--anyone remember \u201cBasic Instinct\u201d?--along with Sofia Vergara showing ALL her assets. It has a threesome between the two women and John Turturro, who also directed and wrote the screenplay, and a gigolo (Turturro) along with a pimp, the latter being Woody Allen. With  all this you would expect a lot of sex or what goes on behind the \u2018business\u2019 but the sexist scene is a kiss in a park in Brooklyn with Turturro giving the kiss. (Hey he wrote, directed, stars in the film--he can do whatever he wants!)\r Hidden in all this is a sweet love story triangle between Fioravante/Virgil (Turturro),  Avigal (Vanessa Paradis) and Dovi ((Liev Schreiber). Avigal has been a Hasidic widow for 2 years, is the mother of 6 children and is in a religious Jewish sect where women are invisible. Dovi is an officer in a Brooklyn Hasidic neighbor watch with special cars and uniforms who has loved Avigal for years but it is Fioravante who brings her alive with innocent touches and that kiss.\r The setup of Turturro and Allen as gigolo and pimp is quickly set up but really isn\u2019t necessary to the film except with Stone and Vergara added to that part of the story extends the film long enough to be a featured film. Whether Turturro would be considered sexy enough to be a gigolo, get paid $1,000 and get Stone plus Vergara I\u2019ll leave up to you. He is sweet enough to get Paradis\u2019s attention.\r Vanessa Paradis steals the movie from all with Liev Schreiber as the sincere suitor who doesn\u2019t know how to approach the woman he loves.\r Instead of the whole \u2018sex for sale\u2019 idea if more time had been spent on defining how a \u2018trial\u2019 can be held and the procedure that takes place, along with explaining more of  Avigal\u2019s life it would have been a better film.\r This is a small \u2018independent\u2019 \u2018art\u2019 film that shows a woman becoming alive because she receives attention that she had never gotten even with 6 kids. It might also spark more interest in the Hasidic Jewish community in Brooklyn.\r \u201cFading Gigolo\u201d is a film that would be better being seen on the small screen but should be seen on a movie screen to see Vanessa Paradis\u2019s face and acting!"

      "text": "\u201cFading Gigolo\u201d was written and directed by John Torturro who also stars in the film with Woody Allen, Sharon Stone, Sofia Vergara and Vanessa Paradis. As is always the case with one who takes on the triple role of actor, writer and director, the objectivity needed to make certain scenes work or not work is lost or seriously diminished. Mr. Torturro, the writer, has written a thin improbable script and, as an actor, relies more on his facial expressions than the dialogue the viewer is begging to hear. Mr. Allen, easily cast as the  elder mentor and friend to Mr. Torturro\u2019s character tries very hard to be the Allen of 20 years earlier but fails in this attempt. He is, after all, an older version of the character we loved to watch and now, sadly, we are conscious of this old man trying to  entertain us. The real value to this film is the performance of Ms. Paradis, a well known French singer, who steals and dominates every scene she is in. This is a movie about Williamsburg, a section of Brooklyn where Hasidic Jews have their own community and how this culture ultimately impacts upon the lives of the characters played by Mr. Allen and Mr. Torturro. As one who lived and worked in that community, I enjoyed the scenes of the lifestyles and people who resided there.  Unfortunately, nostalgia and interesting photography alone are not enough to make a really good movie. I give the film a 7."

      "text": "I know what you're thinking: John Turturro (who also wrote/directed) is too old and unattractive to ever be a gigolo, but his pal (Woody Allen) dismisses those hesitations early. The film starts out with promise, but disappoints before it's over. Even some lovely ladies (Sharon Stone, Sof\u00eda Vergara) don't make it better. Allen plays Allen (but without the funny lines he'd write for himself) and Turturro stays sullen (this is clearly a vanity piece). While the premise is interesting, it loses momentum and never develops the comic potential. Let's just say that Turturro should stick with acting."

      "text": "This film is generally well acted and well shot but the story is all over the place. Further, there are some basic unanswered questions: why is Mr. Allen living with the African-American family - this makes no sense? Why is Mr. Torturro so stiff, cold and  laconic (we have to rely so much on his facial expressions instead of more meaningful dialogue)? Why is there so many Hasidic Jewish details which seem to distract rather than add to the story (the Jewish trial is overdone and not funny)?\r The meeting between Mr. Torturro and Ms. Paradis just happens out of the blue although their involvement develops fairly well. And then, impulsively, she dumps Turturro without any preparation and, to make matters worse, Turturro tells Allen that he's going to just \"move away\". We're left wondering about these details without  satisfactory explanations or development."

      "text": "I enjoyed Woody Allen's role in this film by John Turturro, which had elements of a WA movie (quirky characters, improbable plot lines) minus most of the wit and whimsy. The OK supporting performances could not get me past the fact that almost nothing in the movie seemed plausible. Not sure Turturro could pass as a gigolo in any scenario, but definitely not with the laconic performance he turns in here (minus a few touching moments -- he does have an expressive face)."

      "text": "Although not written nor directed by Woody Allen, it is esscentially a Woody Allen type film. Heavy on dialog, minimialistic scenes with a setting among jews and/or brooklyn. After seeing the trailer I liked the concept with the quick one liners throughout. the movie did have comic moments but essentially was something other than the trailer seemed to depict. Which was a pleasant surprise. However the film ran too long with comic moments too far and between. Romantism with Turturro is funny in itself but after only an hour seemed to far flung-even if Vergara appeared, the story became predictable and good for a one time watch."

      "text": "More of a comedy/drama than the comedy genre that the IMDB website has promoted, \"Fading Gigolo\" enters Woody Allen territory, and his influence is evident when he delivers his lines playing a pimp. John Turturro writes, directs and stars in this movie which is not totally satisfying as the dramatic scenes border on the melodramatic. One yearns for more scenes with Woody Allen as he has the funniest lines and one wonders if he personally contributed to his own dialogue. Sharon Stone and Sofie Vergara are criminally underused. The scenes involving the characters of John Turturro and Vanessa Paradis are the least interesting as this is where the melodrama creeps in. The music score is smooth and mainly jazz influenced, accompanied by some easy listening foreign language songs. \"Fading Gigolo\" is the type of movie Woody Allen could make in his sleep, and when in form, this would be his masterpiece."

      "text": "Pl\u00f6tzlich Gigolo startet wie ein 70er-Schmuddelporno: Swingunterlegt und im k\u00f6rnigen 4:3-Format. Ein augenzwinkernder Einstieg \u2013 denn mit albernen Sexfilmchen hat John Turturros Regiedeb\u00fct \u00fcberhaupt nichts am Hut. Turturro mimt den Blumenverk\u00e4ufer Fioravante, den Kumpel Woody Allen aus Geldnot zur Sexfachkraft ummodelt. Als Virgil Howard und Dan Bongo ziehen die zwei im denkbar unpassendsten Umfeld \u2013 dem j\u00fcdischen Teil Brooklyns \u2013 ein Gigolo-Business auf. Das inszeniert Turturro angenehm gef\u00fchlvoll und klischeefrei, indem er statt Culture-Clash- und Sex-Klamauk lieber ernstere Themen wie Selbstfindung, Trauerbew\u00e4ltigung und sexuelle Befreiung in den Mittelpunkt stellt. Vanessa Paradis etwa \u00fcberzeugt als verkrampfte Witwe, die lediglich durch die sanfte Ber\u00fchrung Fioraventes ins Leben zur\u00fcckfindet. So spricht Pl\u00f6tzlich Gigolo \u2013 seinem unpassenden deutschen Titel zum Trotz \u2013 ein erwachsenes Publikum an \u2013 und nicht die Eis am Stiel-Fans darunter."
