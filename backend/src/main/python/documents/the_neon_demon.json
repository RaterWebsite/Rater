Director Nicolas Winding Refn is known as a dramatic visual stylist, but the design of this film is pretty much all it has to recommend it. Then again, you can watch MTV for 15 minutes and see lots of cool images\u2026without the stupid dialogue and agonizing pace. You've heard the expression, \"You could drive a Mack truck between those pauses\"\u2026in this case, you could drive a whole convoy between most of these lines. The film certainly creates an intriguing world and there are some striking visuals, but as it progresses\u2026so slowly\u2026the pretentious approach loses its edge and the absurd twists just seem silly."

In the initial part, it looked like a normal film and then I think even the writer does not know what could happen, they just improvised with whatever they had. Writing was totally messed up. When they had the great characters, it becomes nothing in the end. I'm not a fan of this director, and all his films are average, but this one is the worst among them.\r I'm not an art film hater, though I hate wasting scenes without any developments and this one had many like them. If you trim them all out, the overall film is around 45 minutes. The rest of the film was just music, colourful lights, and sometimes totally idle, which definitely drag the viewers to the boredom.\r Whenever there was a scene with the story, like dialogues and developments, I thought it was going well. But then those useless, dialogueless segments turned me off. Especially the conclusion was absolutely crap. Elle was good, like a character made for her. Keanu Reeve was useless, his addition was just a marketing strategy that did not click.\r This is the story of a teen girl aspiring to be a model, but surrounded by the jealousy people because of her fast growth. How it all goes between them and in the fashion world is what the film talks. The film is watchable, but mostly the second half onwards it gets boring. In the end, I don't think anyone would be satisfied completely with their watch, maybe very, very few, but if you consider the majority, this does not deserve to be suggested.\r 3/10"

But who seeks for a meaningful movie or a smart story or anything that you can identify with, this movie most likely will be disappointing. I decided to watch the neon demon, because the trailer, the colors and the soundtrack drew my attention. The Neon Demon, is different, but that\u2019s not the part which makes the movie watchable.\rAfter Movies like Drive by Winding Refn, I was expecting something at the same level, but the neon demon cannot live up to it.\rThe story is quite plain. Inexperienced underage girl wants to become model and leaves to the big city, facing the model business and is on the way to become successful. I don\u2019t want to spoil the movie or go too deep into the story, but what killed my wish to enjoy this movie is the absolute non-existent story line, the overly long pointless scenes, where absolutely nothing happens\u2026. and of course the \u201ctwist\u201d in the last part of this movie.\rThe whole movie is almost a 2 hour long exploitation of Elle Fannings body, her face, her eyes and so on. In multiple scenes I told myself \u201cOk\u2026.. We already got it the other 20 scenes before\u2026 -That girl is so special\u2026. But can please something happen?\u201d. I am sorry for everyone who has not seen the movie yet, but nothing will happen\u2026 The \u201ctwist\u201d is just feeling like a \u2013 \u201cWhere is this movie going?? \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 let\u2019s do something gross and \u201cshocking\u201d, but it won\u2019t lead to a conclusion or a point where you as a viewer might feel satisfied\u2026\rOpen, disturbing and provoking scenes, do not make a good movie. For me it is just wanting to \u201cshock\u201d the audience \u2013 but sadly in the most plump and clumsy way.\rAll in all nothing convinced me that this movie is a must see. No outstanding performances, nothing.\rAll characters are like stereotypes and feel kind of wooden. The **** the beauty, the slut, the jealous, the criminal, the perfect boyfriend\u2026\rIf you don\u2019t want to waste your time and ask yourself what did I just watch? Make a bow around this movie. If you are that kind of viewer who wants to find a deeper meaning in a total pointless movie, then go for it and call it a piece of art.\rNothing about this movie convinced me\r1/10"

      "text": "Whenever I watch a Nicolas Winding Refn film, I can tell it's by him without checking beforehand. His films possess similar qualities, such as flashy cinematography and subtle, mature storytelling, though the quality of this form of storytelling has taken a dip in his most recent films. While Drive (and arguably Bronson) had great visual metaphors that will be picked apart and analysed by film students for decades to come, Only God Forgives lost the subtlety and had the weakness of thinking it's plot was smarter than it really was. So where does The Neon Demon come in? Well it's hard to say exactly how much in the way of subtle storytelling there truly was in the film. I'll be buying the Blu-Ray when it comes out next month and studying the film relentlessly to spot all the foreshadowing and symbolism, but I did notice the shift in colour pallet that occurred in a crucial scene half way through, representing a character's arc. However, aside from all of the details I may have missed, what I mean by it being hard to say, is that the director has not made it clear or not whether many of the events in the film are metaphors or actually the real events of the film. I refer to the ending (don't worry I won't spoil anything) in particular. Refn has consistently spoken about the film's ending in a literal sense. Though I have heard theories that the events mirror parts of classic English literature and that the 'Neon Demon' in the film could be the ruthless city of Los Angeles our main character models in, it could be possibly that we as an audience are supposed to take what happens seriously. Since I saw this film back in July, I have been debating with myself as to whether the film's ending is a stroke of genius or a slip-up in an otherwise impressive film. Admittedly, in my own opinion, art isn't truly art if it doesn't offend some people. The ending to Neon Demon is designed to be shocking and memorable, and it succeeded. It is easily the most memorable ending to a film I've seen all year. But does that make it great? Would it be a better ending if it was more believable and grounded in reality. I'd have to watch it again to decide. Overall, though, great film."

One person's garbage is another person's gem.\rThe Neon Demon is one of the most unique and visually stunning movies I have ever seen. A drama/thriller/horror movie that is full of surprises. This is one of my GEMS for 2016.\rI am a fan of the director Nicolas Winding Refn from his other movies i am familiar with, Drive and Only God Forgives. Also two films that were candy for the eyes.\r The plot is both simple and, honestly, a bit thin. A young 16-year-old (Jesse) comes to Los Angels to find a career in modeling. She finds a career and so much more that she or anyone could ever expect..\rThe actual story and the actors in it service their parts well. Keanu Reeves and Abbey Lee are more than effective as the, for lack of a better word, villains in the story. Elle Fanning and Jena Malone are standouts as Jesse and Ruby, respectively..The actual story and the actors in it service their parts well.\r The cinematography is some of the best I have ever seen. Natasha Braier fills the screen with rich, stylish, colorful and disturbing images that left me entranced.\r The soundtrack by Cliff Martinez is GREAT.\r The Neon Demon, honestly, is out there. The imagery carries the weight that the plot and characters have trouble carrying. That being said, there more than a few scenes/images that I was pleasantly surprised by and also shocked by. .\rOdd, strange and bit disturbing. But The Neon Demon is well worth a view."

With a notable lack of traditional narrative or plot the Director relies on the subtext or theme to pierce through the veil of aesthetics and make make some kind of sense for us. The theme has something to do with beauty and how others are effected by it and visually the film is so amazing to look at that this compliments the subtext well. For me it's more like a painting with motion than a film and if it can be seen as such then it's easier to enjoy I think. A lot of scenes in the film just don't make any sense and don't add anything to the thread of a narrative that runs through it, but they are striking and do have an effect on you, which is perhaps the purpose. When the film finished I kind of hated it but as time goes on I'm thinking more and more that it's absolutely brilliant.

The horror comes from the way the story is being told and ultimately where it goes...The mind-bending way in which this film infiltrates your consciousness is no doubt in part due to the absolutely luscious and vivid colors, imagery, and contrasts. Refn is no doubt a student of Kubrick and Lynch as the influences of films like Eyes Wide Shut, The Shining, Mulholland Drive, etc. are quite evident. This is good though as very few visual journey's are so compelling and lingering. Cliff Martinez's score is brilliant and does an amazing job of perpetrating the uncomfortable anticipation and unease of what may be coming next. Refn does a great job of making us wait for the resolution and Elle Fanning gives a performance that is as beautiful as it is disturbing.

Refn\u2019s achievement is almost totally due to his precise and immaculate framing of each sequence and, indeed, each shot. Aided no end by knockout cinematography it all adds up to a fascinating watch as well as being a superb exercise in visual story telling. Admittedly as well as being enticing it is also baffling and there are more than a few longueurs (Fanning\u2019s end of show cat walk being the most glaring example) that could have been excised along the way. Also the film has a couple of rather nasty and distasteful scenes within its framework, one of which involves a knife and the other a dead body, which will certainly alienate a few viewers. Refn\u2019s direction is really better than the slight story deserves. Whereas \u2018Drive\u2019 employed a visual style to compliment the screenplay, \u2018The Neon Demon\u2019 demonstrates the exact reverse. It does, however, have a good and all-consuming final word about the fashion industry which does compliment most of what has gone before and is certainly not anti-climatic.\rTechnically the film is outstanding with kudos especially deserved in the area of costumes, make-up and sound. Cliff Martinez again provides yet another all-encompassing and vital score for a Refn film which contributes 100% to the overall impact"

      "text": "\"I don't want to be like them. They want to be like me.\"\r My God, this was perfect. I was glued to the every frame of this. The visuals are bar none the best of the year and the musical score is heart poundingly beautiful and intense. All the performances were great, especially Elle Fanning as Jesse and Jena Malone as Ruby. This won't be for everyone and frankly after Only God Forgives I wasn't sure anything Refn did after that would be for me, but this fired on all cylinders and is my favorite film of the year so far."

      "text": "Shocking, disturbing, and audacious, The Neon Demon is a neon-drenched behemoth from director Nicolas Winding Refn that is truly a glorious masterpiece. Things really begin to hit the fan in the second half, but even then, the first half is just as equally brilliant. Together, they form a disturbing look at the fashion industry. Undeniably a horror film, The Neon Demon leaves you cool and numb in the wake of its disturbing images of the industry. Refn expertly creates a parallel between the industry and what is portrayed on the screen, eliciting brilliant criticism on the industry and the way in which it destroys young girls, as well as the way in which these girls are victimized and corrupted along the way. Elle Fanning plays the lead role brilliantly, as the innocent, yet decidedly dangerously beautiful Jesse. The dialogue here is terrific, far surpassing many other films from the Danish director. The score from Cliff Martinez is filled with these synthy, creepy vibes that really wrap its tentacles around you and perfectly accent what is on the screen. The cinematography is incredible. From very cool mirror shots to lush looks at Los Angeles, the camera soaks in the neon goodness and is an absolute wonder. I cannot praise The Neon Demon enough. This illuminati-esque, hypnotic, and thoroughly violent and disturbing film from Nicolas Winding Refn could very well be categorized as a masterpiece."

And it is only the male gaze that decides whether someone is 'special'.\r Exploring the impossible man-made, mysognynistic ideas of  what femininity should be and how women and girls have become so obsessed with achieving this utopian ever-shifting image, an idea. In the flutter of Elle Fanning's fittingly doll-like eyes ,we see women talking in fairly high-pitched little girl voices,infantalised , glossed over girls ,all morphing into one gigantic combination of doll parts.Pricked and prodded surgically enhanced ,with the duality of natural beauty and cosmetic beauty ....? but somewhere along the line ,blink ,blink.blink and the lines become blurred. What length will we ,as women ,allow ourselves to go to, to achieve beauty.....This is sisterhood in a toxic ,ruthless ,enthralling stance.\rWith a largely female cast (satisfying the Bechdel test) ,each as equally arresting in their performance as the next,and all are entrancing, in a superhuman powerful kind of way. A huge nod of respect to Elle Fanning, by Jena Malone, Bella Heathcote, Abbey Lee, the core of the cast.\rThe collaborative writing genius of directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, co-written by Mary Laws, Polly Stenham, and genius director Refn, the threesome that have created what in the duration of the movie becomes akin to Frankenstein's monster.\r It's a Freudian ,Lacanian's dream. Woman representing the phallus ,that fallacy dreamt up by the whole Oedipal Scenario, where in attempts to attain the high stakes of this paradox it's every girl for herself and beauty and ugliness spar like you have never seen before. Lustrre and radiance dance together before us in a way that has the sort of addictive imagery of Kubrick and then some. Majestic riches and sparse scenes are reminiscent of a Miles Aldridge post-modern photoshoot. Lies become the truth and the truth becomes a lie, pop will eat itself and heartbreak shatters a cavernous headspace that will leave you bereft.\rA thought provoking , compelling, statuesque monster of a psychological thriller.\rCinematic excellence."

You're the sun.\"\r Jesse: \"It's everything\".\r The Neon Demon is a movie experience that I will never forget. From the minute it starts, I was glued to the screen and not once could I look away, even with the long silent moments, I was still hooked. The LA lights are something to drift away too.\r Nicolas Winding Refn can be a love or hate thing with me. I loved \"Drive\" and \"Bronson\". I didn't like \"Valhalla Rising\" and \"Only God Forgives\" that much. He's got talent, I can see that and I know that he wants to make movies that only he wants to see, and not just for others. I think we all can agree that all of he's movies are shot so beautifully and if one of he's movies as the word \"Neon\" in the title, then you better you expect something glorious. Refn shines in The Neon Demon by adding this dream like fairy tale theme to the mix. There was so many times I had a \"Suspiria\" and a Michael Mann vibe to this (with the use of colors and the LA lights). This was such a step up from \"Only God Forgives\".\r And here's why.\r What \"Only God Forgives\" was trying to get across in it's symbolism was too simple that I pretty much got all of it. It got repetitive in terms of the visual imagery that the film constantly presents, but I feel that those scenes didn't have any glue to hold those previous scenes together. It was pretty much all icing but no cake. And while I got what Refn was doing with \"Neon Demon\" in terms of the fashion industry, but I still feel that there's more to it then that. Even through I don't 100% understand all of it, I still felt that I got more out of it than \"OGF\". Is it obvious of what it's getting across? With the fashion industry, yes, but with everything else, no. I think plenty of re-watches might help, as I do want to watch this again.\r Elle Fanning was pretty fantastic as the beautiful but dangerous Jesse. But I thought Jena Malone steals the show, as she was brilliant. Her character dose the most unnerving things that you can't even imagine, but still manages to be attractive. Oh and I can't look at Keanu Reeves the same way again after this. He's good in this but...damn. Refn characters are not from this earth.\r The opening sequence to this movie is just magnificent. It's everything that a movie should do to get you engaged. The staging was on point, the framing was flawless and Cliff Martinez amazing soundtrack blasting in your ears was just icing. It left a massive smile on my face.\r Where do I even begin with the soundtrack in this movie. It's sexy, stylish with a bit of glitter and just pure magic. It's probably one of my favorite soundtracks of this year. Cliff Martinez is just a fantastic composer that always delivers that an excellent 80's vibe in he's music. Even topping his previous work which I didn't expect him to do.\r There's some things in this that I did pick up on that I'm not sure if others have. The cannibalism in the movie is basically another way of looking at the industry of modeling, with models who actually do starve themselves to death just to get the perfect shape. Basically letting your body eat itself, which is cannibalism. I might be over thinking things, but I thought to throw it in there as a cool little thing to bring to the table.\r Everyone in this film sounds so fake and shallow, and that's not even a complaint. Beauty from the outside but shallow and dead from the inside. It's all intentional.\r It's not a perfect film. The story is flat and the dialogue is really bad in a few scenes. It can be quite stupid at times, but I'm glad it doesn't take itself too seriously.\r This isn't for everyone, as I already have seen two sides to this. You either love it or hate it, and I can understand both reasons. Different strokes for different folks.\r Overall rating: The Neon Demon is a disturbing and yet beautiful film that's very hard to recommend to people. While not my favorite of Refn, but it's pretty damn close, like third place. I honestly can see this having a cult following in the future. I really do."
