Well, the movie isn't as bad as I expected. It's all to clear that the director's first thought wasn't about the script but about the many special effects, but i still quite liked the movie. What made this movie work for me was the humor. Normally this kind of movies takes itself much too serious, there is no place for any joke or funny situation at all. In The Mummy Returns this is different.Thanks to the humor, this movie was very enjoyable, but it is of course the many special effects that make this movie what it is. Don't expect anything real: a mummy coming to life, sucking the life out of people, armies of mythological creatures... will of course never exist in reality, but it certainly was nice to see.I guess it is best to qualify this movie as some excellent way to pass some boring hours on a cold and rainy afternoon.

Rick and Evelyn will have to run against the clock in order to save the world again, and most importantly, to save their son, Alex. This is the sequel of \"The Mummy\", movie of 1999, and has the direction and script by Stephen Sommers and the participation of Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah and Arnold Vosloo, added by Patricia Velasquez, Freddie Boath, Dwayne Johnson and Oded Fehr.It's always difficult for a sequel surprising the audience that saw the first film. This film suffers from this difficulty and therefore couldn't surprise the same way as the first one. The script could also have been more interesting: the \"Scorpion King\" story is hardly convincing and sounds like a sort of publicity for the movie with that name which came out the year after. Dwayne Johnson, in turn, played his role perfectly well: this \"pseudo-actor\" is good for any role where he has to punch four times more than talk. The rest of the cast is perfectly fine, particularly Freddie Boath, who was brilliant in his role, and Arnold Vosloo, who gave his character a psychological depth that he hadn't had the opportunity to show in the first film. The soundtrack continued to be good without being exceptional, the special effects and make-up continued to make their role positively but without surprises. The computerization and digital resources surprised me most at the end of the film, which is very well done.This film comes on the trail of a great movie for the family and for almost all ages. I believe that, despite not having been exactly a surprise to the public, this shouldn't be a big sin. It remains a film made with great care and in an intelligent and humorous way.

There are several metajokes about it in here. So don't expect the scenario to be different. I had no expectation for it but still got pretty surprised.Special effects seem to be a big deal in this movie. I found they were very good at the beginning but yeah, not far from becoming more and more disgusting as the plot moves on. The more we get to the end, the more we witness surrealistic scenes. And there are numerous false connections. Characters don't stop to fast-travel even when they are in the same room. These facts tend to make me dislike 'The Mummy Returns'.Dialogues remains as dumb and lifeless as in the first opus. Characters spend their time explaining the plot, reminding us who each protagonist is, trying to problematize the movie, emphazing the ridiculous drama of the situation. The kid specially is awful: his presence is the reason to showcase silly situations and lines. The couple Rick + Evelyn is terrible. They tried to make them seem like accomplices but it doesn't match at all. They spend their onscreen time kissing and licking each other. Each and every Evelyn appearance seems to be an occasion to make her look and sound hot and horny. At this point it is pretty lear to me that Sommers had some major fantasies about hot female archaeologists. His movie jus was not the best place to underline it. Evy's brother which I found terrific in the first movie is here one of the silliest and repelling character of all. He is just so one-dimensional, and his jokes always fall apart.I have to admit though that this movie was highly entertaining. There are some fast-paced action scenes, some characters are well developped, and it becomes funny to see until which point were Sommers ready to go in order to surprise the spectator. It however felt endless. Let's watch it as a historical event of our times: it is the very first appearance of Dwayne Johnson in a movie. (At this point he iss still very close to be the most over-paid actor in the industry... Funny to witness him making his debut as CGI poorly-animated scorpion king heh !)"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This one is my favorite out of the series. It has all the same cast. Plus the same Mummy's from part 1 along with new ones. Pretty sweet movie."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Wow so many negative ratings but only one negative review (so far). Makes you wonder....Anyhow those who are bashing this movie just because of the CG Scorpion King should think about what happened when movie makers used CG costume in Green lantern. I strongly believe that Stephen Sommers took the correct route. At least we did not get real head hovering in air.This movie is excellent example of show not tell. All the so-called plot holes are totally explainable if you apply simple logic.Plot holes like why Imhotep identifies Evie as Nefartiri this time, while he was unable to do so is totally explainable by the fact that in \"The Mummy\" Imhotep stole the eyes of Mr. Burns who was a person with poor eyesight, but this time round, he was able to procure eyes with perfect eyesight. Then, the rebirth of Anck-Su-Namun is also totally explainable. Meela inherited memories of Anck-Su-Namun, and not her soul. It is similar to sharing beliefs and consciousness with people but being a different person from them. This also explains why Meela abandoned Imhotep in his final moments. Meela wasn't in love with Imhotep but rather she was fascinated with chasing the dream of Immortal Love of Anck-Su-Namun and Imhotep.Anck-Su-Namun soul was now sharing her body with Meela, but her soul was no more than a ghost  which possesses a human host. There is only so much control a ghost can exercise over a hosts body. So, she abandoned Imohotep, when he needed her help the most.Imhotep realized that his true love was long gone. Anck-Su-Namun (who was brave enough commit suicide because of him) had died centuries ago and his era was long gone. He finally glanced at Rick and Evie and realized that in this era the perfect example of true love were Rick and Evie and not Imhotep and Meela. So, he lets go off the ledge.Any more questions?"}], "recommendations": ["shazam_fury_of_the_gods", "night_at_the_museum_battle_of_the_smithsonian", "jack_the_giant_slayer", "incredibles_2", "i_am_number_four", "ghostbusters_ii", "terminator_genisys", "night_at_the_museum_secret_of_the_tomb", "thor_ragnarok", "seventh_son", "penguins_of_madagascar", "real_steel", "pirates_of_the_caribbean_dead_men_tell_no_tales", "transformers_dark_of_the_moon", "pirates_of_the_caribbean_on_stranger_tides", "transformers", "bumblebee", "despicable_me_2", "love_and_monsters", "hercules", "teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles", "race_to_witch_mountain", "hotel_transylvania_2", "mission_impossible_iii", "terminator_3_rise_of_the_machines"]}
