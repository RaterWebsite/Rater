The scarce dialogue, cinematography but specially the 2 young leads are ... inspiring, breathtaking, relentless. There is a moment, a single instant that spoke to me when in a car's tape recorder Rocio Durcal is playing Juan Gabriel (Spanish diva + Mexican divo)... the awkward perfection of this sound insert is, for me, the perfect metaphor of the surprising stuff this movie is made of"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This movie is brilliant. It is one of the bleakest films I have ever seen. By focusing on the touching story of two young Aborigines it successfully shows their harsh reality. Warwick Thornton does a magnificent job in not only bringing attention to the Indigenous issue but also in telling a beautiful love story. I only hope that more films and art like this can have a positive impact on some of the issues that this movie brings into focus."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Dear METACRITIC ITs: Please help me change my user review NAME from raco2046 to cinemaquote.
