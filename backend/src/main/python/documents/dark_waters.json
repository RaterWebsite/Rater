      "text": "When done correctly, average movies like this can inform, intrigue, and alarm, allowing the audience a better chance at a perspective they'd not considered before. \"Dark Waters,\" though, is simply not your average investigative thriller. There's a kernel of truth at the center of this story that's so damning and vile, it would take a real class \"F\" filmmaker to mess up the translation and impact of what's important here. That's not to say director Todd Haynes's presence is never felt. He simply knows that the mere existentiality of this story itself is all the audience needs to stay in their seats. Whereas in other, lesser films you'd be informed. Here, you're upended. Instead of being intrigued, here, you're spellbound. Horrified instead of alarmed. And as far as widened perspectives are concerned? How about trying a major paradigm shift on for size in the form of this harrowing cinematic treatise on unchecked power, the pursuit for truth, and the tragic, infrastructural downward spiral taking place in so many parts of the American Rust Belt. Perhaps I'm just ridiculously uninformed, but I was utterly floored upon finishing this movie. It's an absolute feat for the subgenre, and one that should be seen by all."

      "text": "Dark Waters is one of the most important films I have seen this year. \"Dark Waters\" had my attention wrapped from beginning to end. Most respected critics agree with me. The impossibly courageous and steadfast REAL life hero Rob Billet forces us to face the truth without distraction, glamour or pretense. His humility, humanity, and heart are astonishing. He is a rare and genuine hero in this age of Narcissism and climate crisis. In our age of superficial \"looking away\" from the truth, anxiety and despair this film busts down all the inclinations to hide. I am also surprised by the reviewer missing the artistry of the film. The blue grey coldness that seeps into the shots reflects the insidious corporate crimes making their way into the flesh and bones of the victims. Haynes brilliantly represents the tragedy of bodies and the earth ravaged by industry and corporate greed. This film shows how the consumer and the victims of environmental pollution (mainly farmers and the poor) are abused and hurt by corporate greed. It is an astonishing portrait of courage and perseverance. Showing us that we can indeed overcome evil if we care enough to wake up and try.  I give dark waters an \"A\". The reviewer missed it completely."

      "text": "Despite some occasional tendencies toward being formulaic, director Todd Haynes's new fact-based thriller explores the efforts of a determined community, led by a courageous and ethical attorney, to take on a major chemical corporation hiding the dangers of its products and all of the fallout that comes with it. The film's excellent script does a fine job explaining the complex litigious questions involved, detailing the implications of the crusaders' actions without resorting to jargon or unfathomable legalese. Then there are the superb performances of Mark Ruffalo as the heroic lawyer and Bill Camp as his outraged and victimized client. This is an important story, one that's well told and doesn't hold anything back, a tale that should inspire us all to action when it comes to tragedies such as this."

      "text": "Mark Ruffalo stars as the tenacious attorney who uncovers the truth about a toxic chemical that's being dumped in a small farming community by DuPont. His fight is long and frustrating, but not as long and frustrating as the film itself. Even though this is inspired by a true story, the narrative plays out in predictable beats without any surprises or even inspired dramatic moments. Ruffalo's performance is dedicated, but the lackadaisical direction by Todd Haynes fails to ignite any genuine sympathy or even outrage. An interesting historical story, but the original New York Times Magazine article is probably just as informative and effective."

      "text": "About half way into the film there is a 15-20 second that will have you holding your breath, sitting on the edge of your seat and waiting for the outcome. Though you have seen this scene in many movies it still catches and you wish the rest of the movie was as suspenseful.\"Dark Waters\" is about a lawyer who defended big companies and now is heading a class law suit against one of the biggest--Dupont! Mark Ruffalo plays Robert Bilott who has been just made partner of a well known admired law firm. He is not the sharp, $1,000 suit-wearing guy you mostly see in movies but when a farmer from West Virginia, a friend of his grandmother, comes in with a load of video tapes and eventually shows him where he has buried a hundred of his cows, along with the organs of many, Bilott feels he has no choice and takes the case against the thoughts of other partners.The case takes almost 20 years to be decided and we follow along how Dupont not manipulated the government but also the people. You may not have heard of PFOA but you are familiar with Teflon which is not only used in cookware and how it  does kill people and disfigures babies.This is very much a procedural movie without much dramatics but it handles 20 decades in a little over 2 hours smoothly and let's us get to know many of the characters who are real people as this film is based on a story originally written in the New York Times.In the end credits you get to see some of the people but in the movie, along with Mark Ruffalo, the actors such as Anne Hathaway, Tim Robbins, Bill Pulman, Victor Garber and Bill Camp with others, do a solid job of making their characters believable.As with many films this season \"Dark Waters\" runs over 2 hours and this one could have been a little tighter but director Todd Haynes had to cover 18-19 years and does it smartly."

      "text": "Todd's welcoming gift to this article alike film is important. Grammatically incorrect and even lofty in its speech. But suitably important and that is enough to peddle.Dark WatersThe director Todd Haynes's desk is under tons and tons of paper. The challenging ones are shuffled in a two hour narration and sprinkled incoherently as opposed to a proper structure. It is very rare to see a film that is directed by someone and written by someone else and still lacks a definite pattern. Maybe that is the pattern or simply I don't get it- it's usually the latter one, trust me. But what Todd needs primarily is steadiness. Accepting the calmness, the patience that a job like such offers. Waiting for the formality to settle in and then stir the soup. He is just not ready to let it sit for a while. What we then get is always, everything is said to be in motion, no matter how inedible it grows. It is preposterous how the family drama, the conflict that could have easily rattled you, instead just disenchants you from buying into what they care about. It takes a lot of time for them to finally get into our head, almost in its final act, do we get to sit and mourn, meaningfully. To be honest, I am also going to blame the lack of chemistry between Anne Hathaway and Mark Ruffalo. Ruffalo who is basically a wild bear wearing a suit with manners and etiquette like some member of a White House joining for a big dinner, Hathaway unfortunately feels too sober to enjoy and let it affect her. She is simply not open enough. She had to hold the inner \"warning\" monologue of Ruffalo and instead she is found to be a delicious side dish that just doesn't fit into this cruel chemically conspired world."

Mark Ruffalo does well portraying prizewinning real-life environmental lawyer Robert Bilott, who spent 20years pursuing DuPont for its reckless dumping of highly poisonous; PFOA and PFOS, toxic chemical waste - as used in the manufacturing of Teflon coated cookware, paint, etc - alarmingly, 90% of people will have these chemicals in their bodies! The film is stylishly made and features an evocative music score by Brazilian Marcelo Zarvos. Well worth watching to understand just what corporate greed can produce in terms of human health and ultimate life-threatening contamination \u2013 not to mention corrupt governments and their employees! Several of the real-life victims are featured telling their own dramatic stories."

      "text": "\u201cDark Waters\u201d is stark proof that important films are not always enjoyable.  This is a film people should see.  Just don\u2019t expect a pleasant journey, much less a mindless escape.In 1999, Rob Bilott (Mark Ruffalo) is a corporate attorney in a Cincinnati firm that specializes in defending chemical companies.  When a farmer from Parkersburg, WV, suddenly appears at the office, claiming that humans and animals were being affected by the runoff from the local Dupont plant, Bilott ultimately switches sides and takes the case.  At this point, we\u2019re introduced to PFOA (also called C-8), a chemical compound used by 3M (Scotchgard) and Dupont (Teflon).  It would be tempting to launch into endless details about the well-documented lying, foot-dragging and general malfeasance of Dupont (as far back as 1961, Dupont\u2019s internal medical studies showed that C-8 posed enormous health risks for their own employees).  Since this is a movie review, suffice it to say that corporate transparency and civic responsibility are not key themes in this film.  In the hands of a director less skilled than Todd Haynes (\u201cSafe,\u201d \u201cCarol,\u201d \u201cFar from Heaven\u201d), this film might have been a polarizing, over-the-top political diatribe.  But Haynes veers away from vitriolic exposition, instead infusing the film with a consistently ominous score and dark, washed-out visuals that convey much more about impotent rage and pervasive hopelessness than any speech could accomplish.As the main character, Mark Ruffalo is excellent.  He again conjures up the righteous indignation and poignant disappointment that suffused his character in \u201cSpotlight.\u201d  But here, his role is a bit more complex, with Bilott\u2019s Midwestern diffidence and deference initially obscuring his dogged determination to pursue the case.  Tim Robbins is powerful as his boss, Tom Terp.  Bill Pullman and Anne Hathaway make forgettable appearances.  As the initial plaintiff, long-time actor Bill Camp (also seen in this year\u2019s \u201cJoker\u201d and \u201cThe Kitchen\u201d) steals the show as a gruff, blunt, no-nonsense man who just wants common sense to prevail.This is a film intended to stir outrage.  It succeeds.  According to Nathaniel Rich\u2019s January 6, 2016, article in the \u201cNew York Times Magazine,\u201d which forms the basis for this film, data from nearly 70,000 West Virginia blood samples has demonstrated that PFOA causes \u201ckidney cancer, thyroid cancer, high cholesterol, pre-eclampsia and ulcerative colitis.\u201d  Today, EPA\u2019s website defines a safe PFOA level as .007 parts per billion.  On average, Americans harbor 4 parts per billion in their bodies.  Nearly every American ever tested has PFOA in the bloodstream.  But even now, EPA offers only \u201chealth advisories\u201d on PFOA, guidance that its website defines as \u201cnon-enforceable and non-regulatory.\u201d  Outrageous, indeed."
