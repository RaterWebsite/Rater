      "text": "With a title like this, you\u2019d expect Jane to be a kick-ass gunslinger. Not the case. It\u2019s set in 1870s New Mexico, where a woman (Natalie Portman) pays her ex-lover (Joel Edgerton) to help save her wounded husband from an outlaw gang (led by an unrecognizable Ewan McGregor). It\u2019s Edgerton who handles most of the action, but those scenes are in short supply. Much of the narrative is spent in flashbacks that show how they ended up in this situation and in quiet conversations about their relationships. Even with a strong cast and some decent gunplay, so much of this film focuses on those tedious personal interactions that I wanted to use the gun on myself."

      "text": "After he is nearly shot to death by a band of outlaws, fur trader and reformed criminal Bill Hammond (Noah Emmerich) rides home to his wife Jane (Natalie Portman) and their daughter.  As he lays bleeding, he warns her the dangerous mob will come again, so she enlists a reluctant guardian:  Union hero and former lover Dan Frost (Joel Edgerton).  Jane and the two men reflect on their complicated and painful shared history as they prepare for a last stand.  The pulpily titled Jane Got a Gun is already infamous for its tortured road to the silver screen:  Scottish art-house director Lynne Ramsay quit the production just a day or so before filming began amid legal and personal conflict, precipitating a litany of changes in front of and behind the camera.  Later, original distributor Relativity imploded during post-production; as a result, the film was sold to the Weinstein Company and ambivalently scheduled for release during the January doldrums.\r This unenviable lineage invites contrary readings:  it is a bit mystifying why so many incredibly famous and talented people endured so much headache-inducing behind-the-scenes drama to realize what is ultimately a minor siege Western with inconsistent pacing and an overly tidy ending.  There is no major (feminist, genre-upending) revisionism nor is it a particularly detailed exploration of love and life on the frontier.  The prestige of the people involved and those almost involved (Ramsay, Michael Fassbender, Jude Law) indicated, at least to me, a more intricate, lyrical, and/or visceral experience on par with The Proposition, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, or the 2010 True Grit, but this was either never the case or myriad idiosyncrasies were smoothed along the way.\r Having said this, honorable replacement director Gavin O'Connor has not made a -bad- film.  Far from it.  As a small-scale genre exercise, it delivers certain pleasures, including expansive, parched vistas; a degree of slowly burning suspense culminating in a well-executed set piece; and dynamic lead performances by Portman and a particularly charismatic and stout Edgerton, as well as a welcome dose of camp antagonism courtesy of an underutilized, but game Ewan McGregor."

      "text": "Like the old westerns of the John Wayne days, this movie was very similar in style.  Not a lot of talking, not a lot of doing, just getting it done.  There was a back story of course, and we see it slowly in flashback, and it gives meat to the \"cut to the bone\" story line.  About the only change made for today is the heroine; in the old days, it would have been a young boy."

      "text": "How many times do I have to warn those guys? Princess Padme isn\u2019t worth fighting over. Even Darth Vader threw himself in a river of lava to burn the memories away.\r The scene is the Old West. Take one homely looking woman and two average-looking men and throw them in a cabin together. Now GO! That\u2019s your scene. It\u2019s improv at it\u2019s finest. Actually, that\u2019s sarcasm. Basically everybody just stares longingly at each other and remembers how it used to be. Sigh.\r Did I say that man #1 used to be her fiance while man #2 is covered with gunshot wounds. Did I say that this is Natalie Portman we\u2019re talking about? Hrck! I think it\u2019s happening again! Hrck! Swallow! I think I got it.\r And did I mention that man #1 went off to war and was presumed dead on account of him never writing but he couldn\u2019t \u2019cause he was one of those prisoners of war in one of those camps and didn\u2019t get out until the Civil War was called on account of rain? Isn\u2019t that how it all went down? Oh, the angst! What\u2019s a princess from another galaxy stuck in the Old West to do?\r Well, man #2 got shot up good by the bad guys and the gangs on their way to finish off the job. Since we all know that a woman needs a man around to protect them (that\u2019s the movie talkin\u2019, not me), Princess is off to lay a guilt trip on man #1. \u201cGet outta my face,\u201d he says and then quickly follows her. Oh, the angst! She really loved him before presuming him dead and running off with some guy to have his baby. On the Old West. In a run-down cabin. Just because it\u2019s the Old West, do we have to live in a run-down cabin? I reckun so. Hand me my gun.\r As you may have suspected, I\u2019m not a huge fan of westerns (or Natalie Portman). She\u2019s nice enough on screen, but I just don\u2019t see her as the type to have two gruff men fightin\u2019 over her. There\u2019s plenty fish in the dusty Old West, boys! They\u2019re just floppin\u2019 round and gasping for air!\r This movie seemed plumb full of devices fixin\u2019 to tear you up and man-i-pu-late your feelings. They don\u2019t rightly work, but there\u2019s all over the place."

      "text": "Maybe Natalie didn't ever really really occupy this character, but she did pretty well. For an actress who always seems so young, it was nice to see her be a mature woman. The other characters were first-rate, IMO. Joel Edgerton has quite a future as an actor and writer, and Noah Emmerich played it perfectly. He could've over-dramatized that role; maybe the director had a say in that, yeah? I reckon. I thought the pacing of the story was perfect, and enjoyed the flashbacks. Finally, the cinematography was beautiful; this movie is loaded with jaw-dropping shots. Oh yeah, all the sleazeball bad guys were very entertaining! Holy Toledo, what a bunch of creeps!"

      "text": "A woman's preparation to fight the outlaws.\r Probably on underrated film, but for me, I'm sure it is an underrated film. From the director of 'Warrior', another excellent film to include in his filmography. A well written screenplay, but that's where the problem is according to those did not like it. Because it was kind of 'all's well, ends well' story. That does not mean it is full of clich\u00e9, maybe they expected the film to be more harsh and violent like most of the high profile western films do.\r Sorry to those who did not enjoy it, but I did. It was nothing like only for men, but still R rated. Yep, I understand the last 10-15 minutes was so intentional, so what, the story wrapped perfectly in a right way. I must appreciate the cast, particularly the lead two actors, Natalie Portman and Joel Edgerton. This film is not an opportunity to give the best character display, but everyone did their parts quite finely.\r Ewan McGregor was a disappointment with his useless role. I mean it was a good one, but not made for him. I think the villain character lacks the toughness. That leaves it a one sided theme, so you might not know how the developments happen, but you will know which way is it heading in the earliest. Particularly as it was focused more on the romance, despite it is not a romance theme. Though there is a twist and many turns in the narration. Overall film was very entertaining, partly predictable, yet totally worth a watch if you keep your expectation locked in a safe afar while watching it.\r 8/10"

Ok, I agree, movies should not be rated only in comparison with other movies but on their own too - so, first of all, while acting is not bad, the story itself is not that entertaining and actually is quite predictable from the beginning to the end. Even some twists they try to put in there do not feel like twists and you feel like - ah, whatever, this does not really change things here. It was ok and well acted, but certainly not a movie to remember for a long time and it lacked something in the storyline to be a greater movie"
