After the cash-strapped dad takes a job moonlighting for a drug company, Jack's suspicions about his favorite male nurse come roaring back. When Greg and Pam's entire clan descends for the twins' birthday party, Greg must prove to the skeptical Jack that he's fully capable as the man of the house.",

      "text": "\"Little Fockers\" is a disaster movie. Not in the genre sense of the word, in which some great calamity or other(an ocean liner is sinking; there's a highrise building on fire; bees! bees! everywhere, bees!) threatens the all-star cast's lives, but rather, it's an aesthetic disaster, a comedy with an aura of impending doom. The collected actors, especially the old-timers, decorated many times over with awards and accolades, seem to be slumming like it was the nineteen-seventies. Unlike Fred Astaire and William Holden in \"The Towering Inferno\", or Richard Widmark and Olivia de Haviland in \"The Swarm\", nobody gets out alive in this second sequel to the inexplicably popular \"Meet the Parents\". Unlike Ernest Borgnine in \"The Poseidon Adventure\"(released many years after Borgnine picked up his Best Actor Oscar for \"Marty\"), Robert DeNiro, Dustin Hoffman, and Barbara Streisand go down with this sinking ship of a movie. They're held accountable. Unlike those old war horses from Hollywood's classical period, most of them in semi-retirement when they participated in those Irwin Allen(\"The Master of Disaster\") spectacles, DeNiro and his legendary co-stars are still active, and should be ashamed of themselves for involving themselves in such an obvious turkey. Pure and simple, \"Little Fockers\" is a paycheck movie. Simply put, they phoned it in. On the other hand, Astaire and Widmark, legends from a bygone era, were no longer relevant to the then-current marketplace, and to that younger generation of yesteryear, they had the look of museum pieces in those analog event films, since both actors, and others of their ilk, were presented out of context with what made them vital and worth preserving in the first place. Astaire, the star of \"Top Hat\"(second only to Stanley Donen's \"Singing in the Rain\" when it comes to ranking musicals), who would dance with Ginger Rogers as if his life depended on it, was then reduced to playing a stock character who just like everybody else, feared flames and smoke inhalation. \"The Towering Inferno\" made him look like a has-been, a ghost of his former self. It's the same prevailing effect that the lowbrow hijinks of \"Little Fockers\" projects onto its distinguished cast, especially Streisand, who is clearly no longer a \"Funny Girl\", only fat. Whereas Hoffman gets off relatively easy, in what amounts to little more than a special guest appearance(he calls his son \"Gay\", short for Gaylord, now known as Greg, played by Ben Stiller), DeNiro, overrated as a late-blooming comedian, is stuck with the unenviable task of carrying this film, and as Greg Focker's micro-managing father-in-law and foil, the Scorsese regular gets called on to do something that undoubtedly amounts to being the nadir of his long and illustrious career. \"The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle\", notwithstanding. Erectile dysfunction and its pharmaceutical cure, minded for laughs in the recent \"Love and Other Drugs\", is the malady that keeps on giving apparently, when Stiller, whose participation in the extended boner joke may as well be his career low too, sticks a needle in DeNiro's side effect-plagued baby-making appendage, blessedly left to our imaginations, thanks to a strategically placed child who witnesses it all, and screams. We know how he feels. The boy functions as a sort of in-frame, diegetical film critic. (In other words, he expresses his horror, and our horror of the scene's mounting.) Without his two-fold caterwaul, the medical-related ordeal would have been further exposed as an unfunny bit(the child's screaming may coax some into laughter), and be greeted by the same stony silence which follows the enema(!) that Jessica Alba(playing a flirtatious drug company rep) performs on a hospital patient, and Barbara Streisand's Dr. Ruth shtick(she's the other Jewish sex therapist, Dr. Roz Focker). Ever desperate for laughs, this shameless film makes \"Godfather\" puns(\"Bobfather\" is slightly less painful than \"Godfocker\"), and goes so far as trotting out Harvey Keitel for nostalgia's sake, and promptly gives him nothing to do. Playing a crooked plumber, Keitel's filmic self sort of avenges Scout's death by Travis Bickle's gun in \"Taxi Driver\" when Jack Byrnes gets buried under a truckful of sand. In another film, the ditch that he digs would be used for hiding bodies. In the absence of that film, he could start with his good buddy Bob."

Jessica Alba, the only new starring actress, is the only good actor. It seems to serious, with plots ranging from divorce to heart attacks to erectile disfunctions. Even DeNiro can't act well, with the bland, boring, repulsive script given to him. The only pro I can think of other than Alba are the children. Now five, they're funnier- not to mention more adorable than ever."

      "text": "The third installment in the Focker series doesn't quite live up to the star-packed cast that sets its expectations so high, and then, fails as its characters meander about aimlessly throughout the many dull subplots. Stiller and De Niro do still seem to bring a few laughs with their persistant bickering and their concordance to stay in the \"Circle of Trust,\" but the few bright moments of the comedy we loved in \"Meet the Parents\" are overshadowed by the ludicrous, and at times painful direction of the film. We are introduced to an Alba character, who, quite stunning, has no relevance to the picture. She is introduced on a whim of infatuation to Stiller, and then, awkwardly exited as if she'd made a cameo appearance on a spoof film. Even more, above all else, is the embarrassing references to one of the greatest pieces of cinematic work: \"The Godfather.\" It was depressing to see an aged De Niro, forced to act like a stooge, be lowered to the level of having to say, \"Godfocker.\" I couldn't be more disappointed in the writing of this film as the monologue relies on cheap laughs and cliched behaviors from the children, who, are as one-dimensional as a piece of cardboard. In the end, if you were a fan of the first two films, you walked away from your seat either really disappointed and saddened by De Niro's cinematic demise, or estatic at the rudimentary humor geared  toward the likes of a 6 year old. If you were new to the series and were unfortunate enough to view the latest (and worst) 'Focker' flick than you probably just walked away realizing you should have seen \"The Fighter\" instead. Unless you can shut your brain down for 90 minutes and just enjoy, \"Little Fockers\" is an utter disaster of a film."

Jack Byrnes (Robert De Niro) not trusting Greg was getting a little bit old. I mean come on, he didn't trusted him dating his daughter, marring his daughter and now, he doesn't trust him raising his family. Don't give me wrong, I love the first two movies, but I tough that the third one had something different. They tried to bring it back again, but they kinda failed.

They are just in the movie so that Jack and Gaylord can battle it out with awkward situations again. However, this film does have funny scenes, and now that I think about it, Jack doesn't even do any CIA things, such as the lie detector, or that cool under-the-bed mobile home.

However, aside from these two masterful mains, the rest of the formula just doesn't work - they've tried it just one time too many. Without the event of a wedding, or the actual 'meeting of parents' the film becomes bland and lacks direction. In this case the film revolves around Greg's (Stiller) children's birthdays, which happen to coincide with Jack's (De Niro) feeling that the end is nigh and that someone must fill his boots as the family patriarch. These two events provide little to base an entire film around - especially a film with the potential that Stiller, De Niro and even Wilson bring to the table. At it's best, Little Fockers uses subtle but original humour that leaves one laughing in the same fashion as would have been expected during the first two. At the very worst, it involves exaggerated attempts at humour and absurd plot tactics. In conclusion, this film has been done twice already, the third time was just one too many.

As a big fan of the first two Focker films I was quite optimistic about this one but sadly this was an awful addition to the Fockers. The plot picks up several years down the line since we last visited the Fockers. Greg (Stiller) is settled down with Pam and his twins struggling with his finances and turns to Jessica Alba for help. Jack (DeNiro) has health problems and is looking to hand over the family reigns however he still has it in for Greg and with Greg's suspicious behavior it only makes things worse. Their are appearances from Barba Streisand but its largely down to the few occasions where Owen Wilson and Dustin Hoffman appear to work their magic that save this film from being a total catastrophe. The jokes are now wearing thin and for Focks sake lets just hope that this is the last Fockers film because based on this evidence they are ruining what was once a strong household set of fims in comedy!"
