      "text": "If you see a lot of horror films, you may find this one interesting. It\u2019s not a great film, but the cast is more than competent and the director shows promise. The script has a few interesting twists (no, I am not making a joke about Hannah\u2019s double-jointedness, which is probably one of the least interesting things about the film) and I wasn\u2019t bored. This is probably because Shay Mitchell was interesting to watch, and the rest of the cast was pretty good also. And there wasn\u2019t a lot of exorcism silliness except at the very beginning. This film is more like \u201cThe Autopsy of Jane Doe\u201d and less like \u201cThe Exorcist.\u201d"

      "text": "The Possession of Hannah Grace is by no means a must-see, but I found it to be a decent time-waster.The movie has a nice sense of direction. The beginning, where main character Megan gets a job working the night shift in the morgue in the basement of a city hospital, is especially well-done. Major exposition and the workings of the hospital is introduced in a quick and natural manner.The hospital in this is appropriately creepy, a blend of grey concrete blended with cold, sterile white floors.The possessed body of Hannah Grace is an affective monster. She avoids being being a generic zombie/possesed person by having a distinctive look being partially slashed and burned. Heck she's scary when she's just lying still before she's even doing anything. (I'm actually disappointed they didn't stick with the film's original title of The Cadaver). Contortionist Kirby Johnson really kills it as Hannah, not only in her freaky movements but also in her malevolent facial expressions.Despite the praise I've just given, there is one big issue wit the film: the second act is just too slow and could've been cut down, which is disappointing given how fluidly it started. The problem is that they have one too many victims and spend a little too much time introducing them and building up to the kills."

      "text": "The Possession Of Hannah Grace definitely has its moments of horror and shock value while delivering a setting that will have you disconcerted throughout. However, there are a few moments where it does start to get repetitive, as it delivers weak CGI, poor editing during certain scenes, and dull characterization. As a horror fan, it's a ten out of ten in my heart, but a five out of ten in my brain."

      "text": "The Possession of Hannah Grace is an interesting horror movie. The director, Diederik Van Rooijen, was able to create an atmosphere that was terrifying and had me on edge for the first half of the film. At first, the different scary scenes would be a lot to take in with the cracking noises of bones moving with the unusual body movements. After a while, it became predictable and was something that stopped startling me. The main character has a form of PTSD that is used more as a plot device than an actual part of her character. It is something that keeps her inside the morgue even though she definitely could have left a dozen times when things appeared bad. The second half of the film lost momentum. The story seemed like it was not finished and they were just winging it. Overall, The Possession of Hannah Grace could have been a lot more, but instead gave up the interesting story it once had for a more typical approach."

Also there is some evil entity and poor attempt at acting.Seriously - big budget does not equal good horror. Avoid."

As this train wreck unfolded, so did the cliches and the dramatic Hollywood sets, all equipped with \"overly done\" use of red lights and \"dark shadows\" effects. Poor acting, very unimaginative story. Not good... not good at all."

Love all the Insidious, Anna Bell, and Conjuring movies hell even the last Saw did a better Job at being a horror movie than this. The Movie \"The Nun\" is amazing! Loved it. But this? the possession of Hannah Grace is just an utter pile of trash. Its a Solid 3 for me and a thumbs down."

The story has a unique twist in this genre, and the actress who plays the creature is truly horrifying, even lying motionless.  This film borrows a bit from the old Wolfman classic in that there\u2019s an undercurrent of mental illness in the lead character.  It\u2019s also nice to have a horror film that takes a pass on the obligatory sequel, and has a real ending."

The Characters were boring and sometimes felt like a robot, and the \"Demon\" that possessed Hannah felt like a Marvel villain. All of the humour doesn't land at all, the so called \"jumpscares\" or \"scary\" scenes didn't land either and the dialogue mediocre to ok. I'll give it one thing, the plot is ok but delivered very poorly."
