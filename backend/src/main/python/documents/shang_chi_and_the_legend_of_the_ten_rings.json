That's what I love about this movie, it takes you to a wild journey where anything can happen. The movie has a lot of surprises, a great villain and a good story even if I wasn't a big fan of the jokes that the movie throws at you every time anything happens.In conclusion, this is the kind of movie that you will enjoy if you watch it to have fun. This movie is far from a masterpiece, but at the same time, feels like they finally portrayed the craziness of the comics in the big screen without the fear that it could be too much for the audience."

Friends told me that this is a great movie, but i watched trailer and it didn't impress me at all. One thing is a little disappointing it's the lack of fighting of the shan chi himself."

Cast was wonderful - Simu Liu is a STAR, Awkwafina and Tony Leung were incendiary, the entire rest of the cast were perfect.  The action is so far beyond most other action movies, it\u2019s almost playing a different sport.  The heart of the movie, though - the struggle to find one\u2019s self amidst family turmoil and the expectations of father and the loss and grief embodied beautifully in the movie\u2026THAT is why the movie is truly special."

Even though I don't understand Chinese i'm glad some of the dialogue is in Chinese I love the way it sounds.  The fight scenes are so cool and and I love the fantasy settings.  The cast is great Katy is so funny and loveable and I'm hoping to see more of her and Shang-Shi and Xialing. I'd give this movie a 9.7 and round it up to 10."

That movie is a love letter to Asian cinema and culture!  The reimagining of the ten rings design and powers are super cool and beautiful! Truly one of the best weapons in the MCU. The combo attack of  Wenwu or Shang chi are straight out of a video game! And finally upgrading the master of Kung fu to a high-tier hero in the same level as Hulk and Thor is the best change for that character! I cannot wait for Shaun to interact in with the others heroes and his involvement in the next Avengers and others movies."

The fight choreography and action scenes were impeccable, just so clean and awesome; maybe the best fight choreography I've ever seen and some of the best action scenes ever. The performances from Simu Liu, Meng'er Zhang, Awkwafina, Tony Leung, Michelle Yeoh, and Ben Kingsley were outstanding. The visual effects were phenomenal from the Great Protector to the Shishi to the Dweller-in-Darkness, just some of the best visual effects I've ever seen. The writing was stupendous, the screenplay and story were just superb and the character development especially with Shang-Chi was terrific. The costumes were spectacular. The makeup and hairstyling was great. Also the music was great. An A+ movie and it is definitely in my top 3 favorite movies I've ever seen now."

These latter are some very beautiful, others instead made me turn up my nose. The main flaw of the film is the poorly detailed characters (apart from shang chi) albeit justified by a good cast. One thing that I have not endured instead is that they have wasted the character of ..... guys I really don't know what it's called forgive me(the masked one like taskmaster)"

Doesn't break any new ground, the superhero origin story is formulaic and well-trodden territory for Marvel. This however has some of the best fight scenes which is it's main draw but some of its most lacking characters, particularly the protagonist and antagonist who are both devoid of any personality whatsoever and are hampered by having 3 minor female characters around them who can beat them in a fight, zapping the final confrontation between the two of much tension"

In other words, these films are becoming formulaic, especially since I've seen every one of them. Combine that with the new shows and I wonder if they're starting to get too saturated. This film and one medium flaw and a handful of small flaws in my opinion, but nothing major. The medium flaw was a character's motive three quarters into the film and some of the smaller issues was overreliance and sometimes questionable CGI (reminded me of Black Panther's not so good CGI in parts). Also, it was pretty predictable if you've seen a ton of movies over your lifetime, but again, it's a superhero flick. It dragged a smidge in Act 3 as well. On the positives, it didn't rely on a bunch of clich\u00e9s in addition to the action/martial arts being top notch. The characters were likeable and world building was solid. IMO Marvel makes about 15% \"A\" films, 70% \"B\" films, and 15% \"C\" films. This can be thrown in with the majority."

The acting was very solid from the main actors to the secondaries. The CGI was solid too. The fighting sequence was really good, except for the one on the tower exterior, where it gets too fast and confusing. The music support the movie very well. I give it 82%. I really like it, especially since I never even read one comic about that character. It was all new to me and very enjoyable."

Welp, they better get that idea off the table ASAP, because this movie is not only doing amazingly well, it's also an amazing movie! \u201cShang-Chi\u201d is a unique genre blend of martial arts, fantasy, and family drama.In my opinion, this film had quite possibly, some of the best fights in any Marvel movie. The film had everything you could possibly want in a martial arts film: From elegant \"Wire fu\" fights to traditional martial arts to feudal battles, it was a true celebration of Asian martial arts.Coupled with amazing martial arts, this film also had a fun fantasy element to it: The second half of the movie was filled to the brim with Asian folklore creatures and enough whimsy to fill your heart with wonder and awe.If there was anything I\u2019d fault the movie for, it would be the high budget visual effects sort of \u201cdeluding\u201d some of the martial arts scenes and maybe a bit too much forced humor. It just feels like every Marvel movie HAS to be a comedy these days, and I hope that trend simmers down in the future.\u201cShang-Chi\u201d was a pleasant surprise and a HUGE win for the \u201cMarvel Cinematic Universe.\u201d \"Ant-Man,\" I love ya...
