Since this film is directed by the man who made jawdropping films like Prisoners, Sicario, and Arrival, his articulation of direction and storytelling really does capture the right atmosphere that Ridley Scott has set since the first Blade Runner. Most people that worked with Ridley Scott had already returned for another ride, but this time with Denis Villeneuve. The things that Denis had done for this installment really shines without a shadow interfering at a splitsecond while watching this. The new characters and familiar faces for this latest installment impressed me, futuristic-like production design, electrifying visual and sound effects, kickass performances, spine-chilling orgasmic soundtrack, and the god-like cinematography that Roger Deakins set really does spark a lot of amazement for the sequel. (Get Roger Deakins his OSCAR ASAP!!!!) However, there\u2019s a thing that kind of caused a very little ruckus throughout the movie, but it doesn\u2019t affect the movie\u2019s quality that much since there will be another sequel readied for us to see what lies beneath the door (If confirmed...) Like Deckard said \u201cI did your job one\u2014I was good at it\u201d it clearly refers that someone else besides Scott or Villeneuve will take control and finish the story (if confirmed..)

It deserves no less than a dream team of talent and thankfully that's exactly what it got. The direction is sharp, the visuals pop, the performances emanate, and the writing is true to the source without merely aping all the old notes or ruining all the mystery. Core themes of the genre it helped create like the line between illusion and reality or defining humanity and one's identity are both upheld and explored in increasingly nuanced ways. Those worried about a neo noir film devolving into an action fest can breathe too as that was oversold by the marketing. The one trademark I do miss though is Vangelis' multilayered, ever present composition. 2049 strikes a different tone and isn't afraid of quiet moments, but the absence of one of its predecessor's most defining features remains conspicuous. Still, nearly everyone involved in the project is at the top of their game and should be proud of the work they've accomplished. Time will tell exactly how well the sequel stacks up to the 'original', but in any case it comes as close one could ask for today. I can still scarcely believe it, myself."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "An absolute feast for the eyes {and ears} and despite it's running time and pace, absorbing and captivating.

However, I think the movie falls apart in the second act, failing to bring its themes and plot together. By the end, I feel like even Villeneuve was exhausted by what he was trying to accomplish. I would be wary of these \"masterpiece\" reviews."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "I've just finished watching Blade Runner 2049 and visually, its an amazing film that is second to none. After that said, I'm kind of disappointed with the film and don't think its anywhere as a lot of the critics I like have stated the film to be.First as a Denis Villeneuve fan who have seen all his English works (apart from Enemy), this is by far his least impressive work. The problem is not really his direction, but rather the less than impressive writing and some very on the nose-exposition that makes the world less believable as it should be. Perhaps the biggest problem with this film is that it raises a lot of questions that don't really invite intrigue as it hopes it should do. The film is plot heavy compared with the original, but unlike the original, I don't feel the world building in 2049 is as good as the original. For example, the original was always a character study with Deckard who lived in this futuristic LA who was suddenly plugged back to his job. Here we saw the cyberpunk world he lived in with many interactions between characters that seem real and genuine. However in 2049, Ryan Gosling's character is never really interacting with characters that feel part of the world, but rather characters to further the plot point.For example, many of the character interactions involve just two people who either point Gosling to somewhere or discuss exposition. You never get a sense of any of these characters. Note in the original the society seems lived in with Dekard constantly having to push people away or him drinking the alcohol at the bar which seems like what he would normally do etc. The biggest offender in 2049 is that the film has characters and events that lack consistent motivation with logic jumping points that bugged me throughout the film. Because I don't wanna spoil any of the plot really, its worth noting that a lot of what happens doesn't necessarily follow the things said or done preceding it. That said, the original Blade runner didn't really per se have much of a plot either, but which is why I've always classified the original as a character study more than anything else. Given that Villenueve is a master of this genre (given all his films are character studies), it is ultra disappointing that Ryan Gosling's character doesn't go through the same journey nor development that Deckard went through. Sure there might be some sentimental aspects that happens in the film, especially with the female characters, there is never a scene like when Deckard starts drinking (after killing Zhora) or his nod at the end that symbolises anything gone through, so when sentimental events happen in 2049, I never felt any emotion towards these events unfortunately.The other problem with 2049 is that it sets up a lot of hints of a bigger world which feels like playing an RPG game with many side quests available. In fact, I would go so far as to compare this movie as awfully similar to the Deus Ex game series. Part of the problem  lies with the co-writer Michael Green who also happen to write Alien Covenant and Logan which had the same issues popping up with this film (great premises and start, but then devovles into convuluted plots and sets up that goes nowhere)Given that the original Blade runner inspired so much of the genre we know today, its disappointing that 2049 doesn't really offer us anything new or done better in terms of the sci-fi trope. In fact, 2049 rather borrows a lot of its plot and themes from current films that have done it better. There a little bit of Her here, a little bit of Children of Men here, and even a little bit of Ex Machina, but when put together, does not feel as satisfying.Also with the extremely long movie length (I don't mind how long a film is), there could be a case made that it didnt need to take nearly 3 hours to tell this story. A lot of the film is broken into smaller dense sequences that involve people talking either about what is going on with the world, or furthering the plot. This is why I don't believe the world building is as good as the original. Whilst 2049 remains ever faithful to the Asian themes, the motif of the eyes etc, it has nowhere the ambiguity and the guts to tackle bigger issues like corporation takeover or the idea of 'white flight'. In fact, 2049 seems to abandon a lot of the themes from the original that doesn't seem to reflect in a more futurstic LA.Overall 2049 is still a dazzle of a film and is worth watching as a good sequel. However, it is clearly overstated as the acting and cinematography are great, but not so acclaimed as some might say. There are lot of things that work in this film, but I feel as though this doesn't per se elevate the film to the status as the original. I hope this doesn't become a franchise and that if they decide to do the next iteration, it should be something with a more a personal setting and philosophical overtone, rather than a plot heavy noir."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Yep, another masterpiece, only... not so much. If movies are primarily about the story, the new Blade Runner sucks. There are too many unnecessary scenes, too many amazingly slow ones, and many which I like to call executions - on the surface something happens there, but indeed they are only about exposition. Every scene with annoying Jared Leto is just that: cheap exposition. Bad guys are one-dimensional, unlike Rutger Hauer in the first movie.  Rich, original environment of the first movie are now desolate ruins. Which is nice, for a second, but then you see almost all scenes are empty. At some point, it looks like there are not secondary characters in this world. Gosling was a good choice, and there is enough good thing in BR that you still can watch it and have fun, but BR2049 should simply be much better than this."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Bloated, portentous and worst of all, dumb posing as smart, for a Blade Runner obsessive like myself, Blade Runner 2049 is pretty much a worst-case outcome from the decision to \u201creboot\u201d.\u200b\u200bIt combines the ultra-slow pacing of a Russian art-house movie, with the implausible action sequences of a mainstream blockbuster. It has intellectual pretensions, but no real ideas, other than some half-baked biblical referencing. It takes a lazy, hand-waving approach to its plot and world-building. For me, that\u2019s all unacceptable. If you decide to make the sequel to one of the most revered movies of all time, you need to get your quality bar pretty damn high. Blade Runner made its name by being genuinely intellectual, and having an insane level of attention to detail. This film fails to achieve either.There are plots holes you could fit the Tyrell Corporation's headquarters through. I can\u2019t talk about those without spoiling, but lets just note that the core premise of the movie as spelled out in the opening crawl, the invention and legalisation of unquestioningly obedient replicants, is in direct contradiction to almost everything that follows, including the rationale for the mission the protagonist is sent on. The acting is fine, good even, BUT the actors are doing their best with horribly written characters who constantly make decisions that are absurd, often in order to set up action scenes that shouldn\u2019t logically occur. Where the original revelled in moral ambiguity, we get a cartoonish boss villain who looks and talks like an evil-yoga instructor and appears to live in a health spa, and an even more cartoonish hot-lady-assassin henchwoman. In keeping with that Holywoodisation, all the women in the film are presented as lust objects, either evil or victims, and not in the knowing sense of exploited Zhora or Rachel, but as sadistic titillation.There are a bunch of scenes basically nicked from other movies, in particular Spike Jonze\u2019s brilliant Her.Where the original asked genuinely profound philosophical questions about what it means to be human, this one has some quasi-religious guff about miracles and souls that jars badly with the paranoid, psychological Dickian source material and the post-religious bio-technological world that was presented in the first film.The world building is terrible.The world we are shown also doesn\u2019t tie in with the mostly deserted, \u201ckibble\u201d strewn dying earth of the original. That was a place where almost all the able-bodied have left for the off-world colonies and the only remaining animals were manufactured. Despite some kind of second eco-disaster and a tech disaster both fleetingly referred to in the opening crawl (and in Matrix2esque short films on youtube), the world presented here is less dilapidated, more progressive, more organised, etc. than in the original. Fading art -deco has been replaced by Scandinavian design.The technology is all over the place. Again, that\u2019s hard to talk about without getting into spoilers, but basically the film assumes that flawless AI\u2019s and super functional \u201cnormal\u201d robots/drones exist, and then doesn\u2019t in any way address the ramifications of how those facts would impact the whole idea/purpose/issue of replicants, and how and why they are used, and how/why Blade Runners are used to track them down. I think that comes back to a recurring problem ideas being included because someone thought they were \u201ccool\u201d rather than being story/world driven.There are constant heavy handed and unconvincing analogies beween replicants, and real-world slavery and racism which the film then does nothing to explore.In some ways it\u2019s a bit like the Force Awakens, another recent reboot that I hated. It\u2019s a technically competent film that heavily references the original, in terms of props, characters and art style. It even features Harrison Ford. It has a plot driven by a series of improbable coincidences and chance discoveries that seems more like an excuse for \u201ccool visuals\u201d than a logical, character driven progression. But whereas the Force Awakens knew exactly what it wanted to be, going unashamedly for a nostalgia-fuelled, international, mass market audience, B2049 falls between stools.I feel a lot of people are going to disagree with my negativity on this one. There\u2019s massive hype and hope around this movie, and it is mostly beautiful. Understandably, Blade Runner fans will want to like this movie. but going back to the Force Awakens comparison, after six months have passed, and people have moved through denial and anger stages, the sad reality of how average this film is will sink in.I went in to this one with mixed expectations. I loved Arrival, the director\u2019s previous foray into SF, but on the other hand I thought that a reboot of Blade Runner was an inherently bad idea. For me, this one failed hard, both as a sequel and as general entertainment."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "This is visually exciting and a feast for the ears. Unfortunately every shot lingers on the screen for 3 or 4 times the length necessary to tell the story. And the story is hampered b y a lack of logic.  When the villain Wallace tells Ford he can take him off-world to torture him and get an answer he wants...he could do the same thing in the room he is in. And the big secret is obvious from early in the script.This needs a rewrite from a skilled screenwriter and then a serious editor to trim out the fat...by which I mean you could keep every shot cut to the length to make the next story point and the movie would be less than 100 minutes.The audience I saw it with was restless.

The interactions between characters was superficial and their motives were as well. There was nothing profound like there was in the first Blade Runner. The scenery and sets were beautiful, as were some of the special effects, but a film can't be based solely on these things alone. It needed to have a villain, but it lacked this entirely. There was barely an iota of conflict during the film, it was simply void. We didn't know why the 'villains' were doing the things they did. The problem was again that these villains didn't have real motives. Nothing was believable, there was simply fabricated disdain and strife which didn't serve the purpose of creating a compelling story line.

Technically superb on a visual level, it is a gorgeous eye candy that gives you amp time to observe it's visual mastery and wonder why the heck couldn't they find someone to write for it, not that fanatic Ridley Scott that ruins Alien franchise with his last movies.

Over the top exposition that drones on and on to overly explain and give feeling of importance to an unimportant plot.  So the plot goes something like this;  Rachel and Deckard had a child. so the movie spends 2 hours trying to convince you its important somehow. CGI Rachel was the lowest point of the movie, with the villain suggesting that it was planned for Rachel & Deckard to meet in some sort of master plan.There are a handful of good scenes in this movie. Such as the opening scene, or in some of the visuals. But much of it is style over substance. The good pieces are far and few. And in between are just horribly long expository scenes where characters you dont care about talk about nothing at all. Nothing important or interesting happens throughout this entire movie. Just some stuff happens, some nice visuals thrown in, then it's over. I just wanted something to happen that I could care about. ANYTHING. go down in the streets. show what life is like down there. Let things happen on screen. Get me invested in a character or in the world. I just got so tired of boring people talking. Many of the sets are bland and uninspired. Bland white walls and bland white floors. or yellow walls and yellow floors. Don't bother if you enjoy the small details, because they aren't there. Many of the environments look sterile and lack the Blade Runner 1982 details. The Original movie wasnt like this at all. The environments were dirty, messy. unorganized, and lived in. You don't get that feeling at all in 2049. I get it that its supposed to be like 30 years later. But come on. This isnt meant to be **** star wars.The soundtrack was calm and sentimental at times, and then at other times very obnoxious and loud. I didn't enjoy the tone of this movie. The original soundtrack by Vangelis was beautiful. But this was like a dying cat at times. Also, dubstep. Really? What I would have liked to see in a new Blade Runner film would be a grounded movie about a Blade Runner who hunts replicants. We got that in the opening scene like an appetizer. But then the rest of the movie is just up in the clouds, trying hard to push its meaningless plot as interesting and meaningful when in actuality it isn't. Blade Runner 2049 is style over substance.My rating: Mediocre"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "True homage to the original. A great sequel. Truly refreshing.

This is the kind of movie that makes you travel to another world but at the same time treats of very concrete human topics. It is so rich, it's full of information and questions at the same time.

The special effects are amazing with a careful mixture of carefully rendered CGI and practical effects. The film looks fantastic, but it is the plot that is the heart and soul of this great film. You should go and watch Blade Runner before seeing 2049 and then come and marvel at this masterpiece. One of the best recent science fiction films.(Denis Villeneuve has created a masterpiece)."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I never thought that my favorite Movie of all Time is gonna be this one. Just everything in this just Clicks for me. The Acting the beautiful Pictures and the overall Story is just Perfect. For some People the Movie is to Slow but i didn't mind it because the World of Blade Runner managed to Catch me. I had no hope that it would be better than the Original but i personally find it is. Its is not your average Hollywood sequel. This Movie is what i call an Masterpiece."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Being a fan of 'Do Androids...' I picked this up on a whim and was absolutely flabbergasted. It is one of the most spellbindingly immersive and atmospheric films ever put to tape. The cinematography is first class, as is the acting (I even managed to like Jared Leto). It is the most staggeringly brilliant films I have ever seen."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Blade Runner 2049 is is an amazing sci-fi masterpiece and my favorite movie of 2017. It is phenomenal movie that left me completely stunned and wanting to watch it again almost immediately. I want to watch this film over and over again."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "When I heard they were making a sequel to Blade Runner, one of my favorite films at that time, my reaction was \"No! Leave the original alone!\". Thank God they didn't because Blade Runner 2049 is just as good, if not better than the original.I remeber my biggest fear was that they would drop the slow pace and noir atmosphere for more action and explosions, but thankfully, the film remains just as slow and just as great for it as the first one.The effects are outstanding and sure to stand the test of time just like the original's. Roger Deakins' cinematography is stunning in every way. The performances from Ryan Gosling, Ana de Armas and Harrison Ford are spectular.I love how realistically the technology has progressed since the first once. Everything's just a little more advanced after thirty years.I also love how it subverts the \"chosen one\" trope.K may not have been a real human bean, but he sure was a real hero (sorry).Rarely does a movie come around and blow away all my expectations like this."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Dennis Villeneuve once again proves himself to be among the most competent directors around. A sequel that arrived this much later and still delivers on every front? No wonder he is my favourite director!"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This film is a work of art. Stunning images, fantastic sound design and beautiful colors.
